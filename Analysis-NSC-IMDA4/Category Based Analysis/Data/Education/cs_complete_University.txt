siapa about conveyance
like normal alpha tak ada buat ah
actually they can buat ah habis buat
dia ada feeding tube so makanan terkeluar

medical relay ah habis dia nampak segak entah
tak ah pakai seluar jer ah bunker dengan seluar
then the top helmet put tak pakai so it's just
bawa that one medical punya equipment bag then itu jer lah
cause the dah kena buat one year course ah as in their attachment to the medical side
last time macam indefinitely kan dia orang kat medical side
huh ya ke
but asal boleh sampai lapan orang buat is it wasn't like alpha be come like on time and then
it's just my sekarang like baru like ons ah sikit
ya baru tukar about two months ago
he ask us like uh sec com for I left oh ya the worst part is that dengan is double meaning now
so like the one five tu sekarang is on repair
cause the crew is the exactly the same so macam sama
then ya lor that's my last duty ah double meaning but I left tak ada call lah
ya tak ada
like betul betul I need to do on somebody I think I'd be a bit more confident now
pasal macam before this you only pernah dengar macam belajar theory kan
I mean apa office cakap

so in the end convey ke tak convey
at least rabak call like you shagged out but at least you are doing
siapa siapa yang call
asal dia sengaja swallow ke
bodoh sia
this is the more all the at least this is one of the more interesting punya merepek punya call ah
apart from the yang the maid the kena rasuk that one
after did you hear about the one the my batch as in the one that I going to already then the guy kena rasuk one
merepek sia
err something like that lah so macam there's this very thick
heavy door ke apa kan
then two of them dah terkeluar so got one guy left inside

then dia orang tunggu kat luar then like eh asal tak perasan sia
banging on the door like tolak tolak tapi tak ada buka
and like the lampu was on everything
sia lah like tak ada buka ah
so then he don't know why okay this part this part is err a bit scary part ah he don't know why but he went to panjat to the downstairs the scary part
so it's like you can take the ladder to go downstairs to the first floor punya fire fighting store
downstairs is confirmed locked apa
if upstairs tak buka then korang downstairs is like even worse it's gonna be locked also
then he climbing down the ladder he looked down gelap kan then he saw like a figure in a corner like swing back and forth begitu
ah then he like panjat ah
then he panjat back upstairs
he panjat back upstairs then after that then the door opened ah
tak tak dengar ah
that's almost as scary as the tu ah
as in not my call lah but the one that guy kena rasuk
mine is mine is like first hand experience lah this one is just macham
okay lah but to me now that I'm not to me now that I'm not staying in station in anymore like tak ada lah
K brother tapi semua ramai ramai pe
seh ah tak boleh baik baik ah
tak buat benda tapi masa secondary juga ah boy karipap
vaccination vaccination apa sia
tak ah take ah
then I thought like okay lah maybe cause tak cukup tidur ke tak
salah bantal something like that
I don't know what kerapu
I think I tengok first because usually for me
something fancy for tengah hari lah makanan tengah hari lah
uh nasi you know
fancy tengah hari macam nasi kalau malam more like salad lah because of your condition right because of your kencing manis right your diabetes
for the for me the kids kalau ada nasi ada ikan they will eat lah
uh but I don't want to buy tadi bila I beli ikan tu I tak nak beli banyak ikan takut nanti simpan dalam ice box bau so I rather just buy satu ekor ikan lah
dari beli dua ekor itu hari I beli dua ekor abeh tak dapat habis
you know susah nak habis abeh end up buang you know so I rather not
sebab tu tadi bila kat sheng siong tadi
I beli satu ekor ikan aje
uh tapi ada kala pula I feel serba salah when I do that kena beli satu pula nanti the kids I want some more fish you know macam
kadang-kadang pula bila masak ada plan tapi mak bawa makan ke
you know atau my mother give food untuk uh she packed food from from her house right then she give also that would also
I have to wah I edit punya rak
tapi semalam punya not not that bad lah but it's just a simple two three pages
jadi macam eh
you know macam if you sit you if you did it this way for your write article you will have less problem lah I would have edited even faster but semalam I
I edit tak I didn't really require a lot of time lah think within less than one and a half hour
or less than two hours dah habis ah edit
uh tadi I berbual dengan my
my russian teacher tu the skype over skype eh
he would we were still talking about music cause last week we were talking about music so he ask me he was err he was a having a conversation with his friends our uh what some he has some friends from thailand so he told me yang
I and the song was from tokyo square then she's like tokyo square so he thought that dia dari jepun ke group ni then I at the moment he said that my eyes lit up I said yes he and I think he knows that singaporean lah it's a singaporean group he did a study but he he actually he did a research and he found out that the group was a singaporean group but the song that he quoted that he liked was uh
but the song actually nice tapi dia pakai lagu sukiyaki punya lagu tau do you know sukiyaki right there's this
uh it's not an original so I told him that when I was young I follow kak tina to this concert by tokyo square
uh that is the originally is from tokyo square but there's some uh famous mat salleh singers sing that song lah western singers that err sing err tokyo square punya lagu but that is I say macam singapore okay comparatively to russia over to
a lot of talent lah they don't macam you know
uh but dia punya melody has been reused and reused by other bands lah but that is not the most famous tokyo square
uh because like I mean nama tokyo square tapi dari singapore you know macam
because my I think kak tina did some events ah for local music group in the eighties so when she also babysit us so she
and that they were performing dekat mana tau kat depan if I am not wrong eh at this padang area near parkway parade
no macam this area dekat depan parkway ke sebelah kat parkway ke one of those area lah because parkway was you it was like a famous lah you can see shopping shopping mall shopping center dekat eighties nineties mana ada banyak
I think kalau mungkin mungkin yang singapore yang rock band lah yang dulu-dulu ah
ah the malay rock band ramli sarip all that there is known tapi for the english
medium eh english medium tak banyak that's why tokyo squares is one of tapi yang you kata sam willows sekarang famous there were a few ah
like they say kembangkan dia punya talent ah
you know macam yang ada english the err english medium ada but they are not
they are not world famous lah macam the their world famous because they perform
like macam siapa jacintha ah jacintha abisheganaden I think abisheganaden is it halim
but macam you have err macam art fazil you have err jai eh is it jai is it the
I think macam we we we know okay like macam acting a lot of them because of the
the khairul anuar join siapa apa
the malay channel lah siapa tu
ah not really talent train lah it's just that they give opportunities for them because there's a market macam kira malaysia ada market you know
macam nak cakap pasal comedian ni semua macam kita hantar kita hantar comedian pun comedian macam err suhaimi eh suhaimi part time you know at least dia dia part time mostly full time you know so he doesn't really get to hone his comedic skills that I know
no I think macam pasal singapore banyak pakai script
singapore the the ah they're not very good with improvisation tak bagus
ah I I I understand macam boboi boboi punya jokes eh boboi the group the maharaja lawak eh kan they have boboi they have the different
ah what is that either let like either when they talk about loghat eh there's always a tema tema like like loghat like is always going to be malaysia menang because singapore tak pandai buat loghat you know
they can really do loghat know and they really are very good at imitating macam singapore punya macam they are not that fluid their ability not that fluid
you know macam malaysia really bercakap loghat loghat is accent right kira loghat orang kedah orang kelantan and then
kita punya loghat is loghat bahasa baku
no no but they are very professional I remember I pergi err the not kedung kodek what's that
the maria hertogh riots thing right so the I remember I was watching pi mai pi mai tang tu at that time was imuda imuda that there were some people sayang they can perform on stage four to five hours I mean it was a three hour show three hour plus show with interval almost four hours they can really they have really showmanship they are really professionals you know
because they can really perform ee apa tu they can really perform macam
buat masa yang berpanjangan tau macam ada stamina is really that atau buat orang macam orang pergi kelantan kelantan they they the people doing dikir barat
they can really do dikir barat the whole night you know because that is like their training you know
uh macam for us it's not like that at all that's why I say it's amateurs lah
the yang yang lama-lama lah
dia kata orang glamour ada what is that ah
that's the not singapore idol the one ya they go to malaysia dia perform astro punya lah
I think astro punya organise so ya guest judge was
ah tapi dia ada all the the veteran singer so hady was face off with this other
ah so they have this person in the end dia menang dua-dua two of them memang kan
why now you know macam like in a way kenapa sekarang kenapa tak dari dulu lagi kau datang kat malaysia you know
ya pasal dia dah then he wanted to stop then he went off drugs right then he he he decided that okay this is really menyanyi is really his talent you know
no but macam I remember when I was watching those chinese drama series eh
junior eh yuan ching you tahu you kenal dia was she some
ya zoe tay was from your ni
yuan ching yuan ching yang dekat jurong eh
no but but you had that yuan ching punya alumni yuan ching punya alumni is it yuan ching
yuan ching macam hancing the the yuan ching punya alumni dinner right you eh
err your friends apa ashik eh siapa
amin kan dia orang tak pergi eh
I told you the three of you form a table what with your other friends and sama kelas
now memang susah
cikgu ahmad said macam pernah dengar jer
is it badan besar rambut putih eh
ya macam macam macam seroja was telling me she was retiring from right I feel so sad you know
you know to be ya I mean be err get get new more books you know but macam the way he said like they said well you know like the wood that's it for me man and it's just macam seroja
you you are I'm not I'm older than you sayang
ah tu ah si si siapa was telling me these millennials ah because it's
ya but for people to retire they should have money right all that right mana tengok seroja I tengok kesian ah
dia beli rumah tu about satu point satu satu point dua juta tau
you know the the the my russian course mate that that wanted to uh buy a house right that one right she told me that she wanted to sell her house pun err
uh it's slow down macam orang pun tak nak beli
rumah dia kata rumah dia sepuluh tahun dia beli rumah tu I think
uh dia pun nak jual dia tak nak jual
macam tinggi lah tak nak jual harga tinggi lah she just want to sell uh
ah and then she will she loved to cycle at east coast so it to her it doesn't make sense to cycle dekat
her condo tu kan not near the beach right so macam
to her is an effort lah to go back and forth naik basikal di situ and I think a bit ulu lah because situ kan jauh kan
she like cycling but macam
she looks amazing for her age and then she also does ballroom dancing so it's very interesting but macam
for me when I see her I tengok I don't think money is a problem of course she like to
macam is typical of err they're people from their group right they like to think about money they like to make more money but I think for her to be able to
macam still tinggal that rumah walaupun rumah tu belum jual and still have err her she's start to pay ready for her house
no no hers was second hers was a new lepas tu dia kata ada
ah tapi besar because rumah dia belum habis renovate eh because they had to for stall the
uh the no the the macam kira development dah habis semua tapi orang semua I think they nak renovate ah sikit-sikit kan
tapi pasal renovation kena put on hold because of the COVID
so I was thinking to myself oh not bad eh dia tak payah jual rumah in order to live in that place you know
because most people they have to jual rumah so maknanya dia ada duit juta-juta I mean she's already nak dekat enam puluh lebih dah enam puluh nak dekat enam puluh lebih gitu and therefore someone like her not having to sell the place
maybe she has the money ada duit juga ah
that one betul-betul ada err pool or view of the pool ya
tiga tiga bedroom
she say three bedroom but I only went to her bedroom because her bedroom ya is the one that opens directly to in front of the very nice sayang it was like
uh I think I think for dasha dia terperanjat tapi dasha memang tinggal condo she shared with a flatmates dulu dia tinggal dekat sekarang dia tinggal kat condo I think she found a new flatmate eh and then macam kat kat russia kan they don't have this quality of
uh so it's a bit you know she's also quite aware lah about the development about about buying condo uh that dasha is aware so macam macam it's very sexy lah
no I think she stay I think she stay at condo because dekat itu dekat dengan russian nya embassy
and and then dekat bukit timah dia nak dekat dengan nature agaknya orang putih gitu kan
ah shared dengan ramai ramai ramai
I tak tahu I never ask
uh but I think she like the location agaknya
uh because this mat salleh they like their nature they like
uh dia naik bus dia dia orang naik bus
because maybe the flatmate yang dia suka yang sekufu dengan dia agaknya
they're not really macam kita a bit rude about money we talk about money like macam I can ask audrey and she doesn't feel offended but if I ask the question to audrey I think dasha will be uncomfortable
because it's not something that europeans like to talk about macam
macam it's not really the thing lah macam us cakap berapa kau beli berapa kau jual
you tahu this this year I don't see her spending anything dia tak beli baju baru
mungkin dengan boyfriend dia ke apa kita tak tahu kan mungkin ada boyfriend lah
kalau like that okay eh
uh but sami suka
macam dia dia kata dia ada swimming pool kat depan rumah dia tapi tak pernah guna kan uh that's fixed to me condo lah
macam some of the aminah punya friends right they tinggal condo ah
uh macam err I guess that's macam we have friends in I remember I have friends in
I mean we are just three room four room dweller but that this fence pula tinggal rumah sebuah tiga tingkat they're they're thinking already and the way they speak already different
yang pak ali eh you know pak ali always get the best grades macam dean's lists lah borhan also the one the radio warna right but they were from it doesn't
macam ya people used to think that err
he was educated sayang he was educated when he was young he was educated in eton tau
did I ask him what did you do he's baba budak orang baba
dia kalau sayang kalau dia hantar dia pergi tuition
dia pergi tuition do you know how much people pay to teach him tuition
uh teaching macam he has he has his full time job
even after tu dia continue but then he will still had the student that he were charged a lot for you know so macam you know you have this
but he's very nice lah I think the reason why he wants me to be the partner is because his german is better than mine he doesn't want a partner that is much better than him of course you know so every time kita because when you have a partner you have to have a conversation and your teacher have to observe you berbual and then dia dia dia punya orang tidak apa punya orang so most of the time we speak melayu and baba so
I cannot go to germany but when he went to germany and he asked me what do you want me to buy for you so I I ask him oh can you get for me this this this this you know like the like from the then he will get for me lah of course lah he won't pay for it lah but because it's my mahal right so I pay for it but it doesn't matter
but it is like you order it it will be more expensive so he went over there dia beli dia ingat I don't know how it is now terrence
no no no dia nak pergi actually tak nak pergi singapore
tapi dia kata dia not good enough lah dasha kata sebab tu eton they didn't choose it didn't choose her but actually eton then after that the eton got
a professor but dia orang lah
or american eh but very fluent in russian and then because err project was saying in oxford you have people doing other languages but macam macam russian only a few know
uh tapi be you know why they go to russia because dia punya tuition fee
singapore I tak tahu but uh
so there were err she was speaking russian to her husband and dia she have two children two or three children they all go to sabah or sarawak then after that yang orang kat belakang dia there's this man ah err medical doctor
dia kata oh he he he spoke to her he spoke to her in very fluent russian and he actually learns err medicine in russia
no but I think is in a hospital in malaysia dia orang recognize
I think wait singapore punya that they have a different different tu ah
because I remember my friend you know yang arwah nadim tu yang meninggal tu isteri dia
belajar medicine dekat kelantan lah if I'm not wrong kelantan also
but kelantan ni banyak
but kelatan punya he he actually don't want to go there he doesn't want her to stay there
tak recognise kelantan punya medical certificate
so that's why she remained in malaysia he works here so sometimes dia come back
err to be dia kerja kat mendaki kan arwah dia until he very sick already he went over there
um but yang your friend tu siapa
yang your friend tu yang follow kita tu pergi kashmir siapa tu
you know that the hair stylists yang I pergi the hairdresser tu yang pergi kedai cina tu anak perempuan dia tak boleh masuk dekat medicine school dekat singapore so she actually took out a I think two hundred thousand dollar loan
so she want the daughter to but I said can practice she said can your daughter said can practice that's why dia pergi sana tapi dia takut anak dia tak nak balik dia kata anak dia suka australia
ah because dia tak stress lah macam singapore
kan bilang
err so pula dapat keluar pergi luar negeri
she wanna do psychology from what I heard she wanna do psychology siapa si
ustazah yang teacher that the
class no that the degree that they have like for example yang daripada
apa eh
it's not considered a degree level macam for example you want to be a teacher right
yes that's what my ustaz told me
so macam it has to be like they recognize degree
jordan I tak tahu
could be ah because mak dia mak dia tak nak but but but uh the ustaz kata that's the reason macam for example kita dapat second upper the second upper uh or first class you got your pay scale it they are not even considered degree
ya that's why like people say why they go to madrasah for that's the big question everybody ask
agaknya ah tu
I don't know now err COVID I tak tahu ah
so that's why a lot of people recommend pergi jordan
there's dia orang punya
kan itu hari si king of jordan datang
I don't I don't see her posting anymore because usually she like to post about those people who come from afar cause her part is medical she's actually in the medical tourism line where she does translator she does translation for people from middle east like which I think she know five dialect a few from eygptian like tiga empat daripada eygpt and then she knows other dialect lah so dia kata ada kesian because she was telling me because dia kenal-kenal dengan ustaz
ustaz hasan so dia bilang ah dia bilang dengan I lah some of them come from negeri yang you know they come from kampung so only know dialect tau dia orang tak tahu so they don't even know so she try to bend here bend ah
and this lady have a condition ah dia kata then I ask err your cousin eh how do you translate all those medical term to that because she needs to know what she's getting herself into eh a'ah kak tini bukan senang you know like nak kena ni nak kena surgery nak kena ni can you imagine nak kena like you have to a bypass and how to you have to talk about the heart all that I said if you need to talk in a dialect how
she sometime tunjuk gambar tunjuk gambar gini cakap lah nanti orang tu boleh faham dia kata and then the sad thing the sad thing is the embassy spend thousand of dollars on these people agaknya derma I think embassy derma agaknya and then spend money on them you know err spend the money on translations err these translators
oh ya because the the king would err hussein not hussein I I I kenal bini dia uh he was very impressed the singapore side very cepat very efficient
but when I was telling doctor ustaz hasan ustaz hasan apa dia showing off
uh that is the rumour lah that she tunjuk the jam
ya but it's also something that has strength lah because her fusha is very good like the orang arab dengar fusha lah yang I try to berbual dengan ustazah hadijah
itu fusha but okay so macam the the difficult dialect is not egyptian lah according to them lah but I don't know I tengok egypt in dialect very different because people say egypt punya dialect very near fusha the standard model standard arabic but if it drove many people don't speak more than studied arabic everyday
banyak orang arab banyak kan very diverse
dia tinggal kat egypt itu dia tinggal mesir dah berapa lama she even take she even take talaqqi courses at the the famous egyptian scholars when she was there she told me
also she taught she take talaqqi she taught she taught me how to tajwid
she told me yang the and then when I ask abi abi say betul
ada yang ustaz yang famous sampai boleh kalau you buat salah your bacaan sampai boleh ambil you know your you know the what is that thing ah
when they collect the smoke the cigarette punya ashes leh
like garang ah
let her bukan poly tak boleh pakai tudung pakai jer tudung kat poly
or you want her to go okay lah go pakai then there's the other thing lah
I think err tengok appetite dia macam math and science
in singapore you cannot do well macam
macam I don't think so lah
err namanya
tak tahu ah I just tak cam tak ngam dengan dia sangat lah but she's very close to murni so now she's the
punya translation unit she she's the head you know
pasal I selalu berbual dengan dia
then I made her watch asian alida bahasa melayu I even I even err
gunakan err
apa tu penterjemahan eh
penterjemah subtitle ah dalam bahasa melayu
dia suka ah mula-mula tak suka mula-mula tanya apa mak maknya tu kau tak sayang nyawa kau eh you know the cerita ejen ali kau tak sayang nyawa kau

today eh today lah kan si kakak ajak keluar hari ni dia kata tak nak
eh then si affaf macam mana sekolah dia tu
sekarang what we hear lepas tu ada kata start january ada start march what you have to start you know much ya okay the thing is
err tu lah I mean the the the
correspondents tu macam last time when I go melbourne study kan
in seoul is one of the agency other agency pun ada so like this uh uni oh kaplan one of it is there any other agency
uni mana apa buat
but if there's no choice how rasa if
the one that those without the apa is without the examining examination tu macam mana
so nak kena ambil I mean it's the same
if she opt to other macam early childhood
can she use the diploma or tak boleh pasal dia tak bridging
ya example kalau oh this one ada the next one is this one is uh no not examinable
that's two lah satu sama ada dia nak ambil with examinable
and also must know whether the diploma if she has tu boleh pakai tak nanti kena ambil lagi kan
cause if she wait again dah she waste one year ni dia wait again tiga bulan
I thought she say dia punya sekolah macam
career gardens apa
is different course now this the uni is still exist lah I mean the the this the studies only the courses no more kenapa low intake ke
but the thing kalau macam because now pun she take the bus pun she will pay adults fee just no school pass kan
mm waste about five thousand one year I think is probably that baik go to other place seh
consultant I don't know then one time you just trash out nanti tak tahu lagi
this is kaplan tukar dia punya uni kan with these courses
can check online tak
cause now is limited time eh sekarang dua puluh plus
I her other friends sekolah mana private mana
kaplan juga bukan
with her behaviour seram
your lifestyle lah kan macam
campur-campur orang okay uh jaga diri
because suasana lain tau suasana part malaysia suasana part suasana part
ada tau ah
tu lah yang si ustaz anak dia kan remember murdoch apa yang ustaz salim pun kan you just uh go over to malaysia lah rather than go
what you can when uh other uni other places kena start dia punya tu kan then from there
kalau kata recognise that's a plus point lah kan I mean singapore to malaysia tu wah one more year
tapi tak ada uni photography eh ada ke
cari apa tu lah you you you sign up with uh intern at Sony
uh ya yang yang yang resale ah resale of
post apa post recruit people
anak tiga tu eh
is it matters if you plot english and english and maths lain english lain
uh uh you I think tak payah you can just put a survey K put a survey
ah now SAM ada new uh so called syllabus come out for english
are you if you are offered are you interested to be uh enrolling your son ke gitu lah kan
from there then you see kalau ratio dia only about ten percent
tengok uh I don't know how you I mean you can limit to one class lah kan
kalau ramai orang healthy response then you can consider open kalau tak healthy then
better ya cause we don't want need to to be up to student the student then one teacher I mean you buat habiskan duit on that
no I didn't do anything tak ada your one
I tak buat apa-apa
dia suspend
suspend jap
so what you saying is what oh ya english if both english uh she can ajar english dengan melayu eh english dengan melayu
english and maths then is much better lah then for si apa tu si
the tutor tak jadi eh no no the uh chinese boy is one thing lah kan this thursday jumpa you kan si yang yang keng kok
eh so post post ke
or no partnership you can say lah is difficult administration susah I either want to
nanti at the end kita bergaduh susah safe
then you can you can say lah now pun dah fifty students
mm first day dia datang just take it okay
and some of it with the P two lah kalau dia ingat
apa tu all all the progress report
then you going to apa tu send it through WhatsApp lah kan
I cakap it can be WhatsApp eh I say to you ah that day
no the thing is parents kalau
ah cannot cannot can't be bothered tak semua turun can count
the children tak kasi
then apa tu that day oh ya I dah bayar stamp fee
kena bayar lagi another six months
supposedly you know lah we aim to for for yang to take over kan sekarang kita ada but I will see if after six months he
dia tak payah become funder ah because macam
okay I fund you okay you run tak gitu lah you must be committed
apa yang tu I mean we can change lah apa yang
tapi I
kita nak dia to be a chinese kan kalau dia is a eurasian
ada patient tak ah we're going to wait for what what what
but if the children going tak tahu juga seh
then then you ask him about you are staying juga eh ah about journey travel
dia tak is his ah
dia graduate ke apa
kalau kan dia ni main intern teaching long time lah dia mengajar
just now you say I'm just from something is it his uh secondary school kat mana
itu jer bahasa melayu yang awak tahu
so now he kerja part time part time ni lah full time lah
okay lah dia dah tanya you tak tahu kalau dia
but eh ya lah but the thing is kalau he is okay I willing to do these two hours first kan
his is dia punya rezeki dia lah kan if you don't want to be
in situation yang menyusahkan oh okay nak terus okay jer
but the thing is uh dia dah approach lah whether he is the type yang I tengok dia badan besar
kalau dia is the funny guy apa macam you know he can uh communicate with the kids ya first he's a guy kan
kids semua suka girls ladies
gitu ah if this guy is that one that uh can communicate uh friendly then he's it lah kan
we might just uh end of the contract lah kan macam tu lah
cause the the you can see the sepatutnya apa
apa uh expose the student yang you have to serve the six month ah and you want to have that
nisa next year tak tahu cerita
uh apa eh
uh econs ah ya and it was like so difficult but we were on a zoom with like seven other students then we all buat the test together
we just macam one student apa tu one student screen share dia punya screen like when he was when he while he was doing the the quiz ah
we all help him lah do the quiz then after that then we all collate the answer abeh kita submit
but lucky lah cause like I never study my friend also never study then we just action jer macam like uh A A I think it's A
huh kenapa
um aku tak tahu yang besok deepavali actually
tabbouleh eh kat itu uh arab street eh
boleh ah
I tried before also kat arab street but
pricey kan macam it's mahal
oh is it macam dia macam cake right eh no
oh yes yes yes yes yes ya ya ya ya ya ya I know what I know what you're talking about ah that one sedap seh
oh kat arab street also
baru buka oh
I feel like eating apa konditori dekat arab street
is it damn sedap serious ya
but its like damn sedap lah when I go there like aku always beli
oh dia jual ice cream eh oh ya ya ya ya but I never try the the waffle one
ya wah so today you jalan-jalan ah oh
wah wait you pergi dengan siapa
ya I just did school stuff cause aku belum habis essay
bila submit deadline
ya so that's why ni kena fast game
ya abeh rumah dia
my friend's house tadi
rumah dia macam sejuk ah then I was like sneezing
abeh but if she off macam panas
the kipas not strong enough
ya and then we just ya we just had lunch abeh supposed to uh apa buat our assignment ah then she like uh penat ah
ya then I was like eh I come to your house then her parents balik her parents balik uh apa dining cause we were studying at the dining table
then the was beside the dining table and macam their sofas and everything ah right
then parents dia okay I eat dinner ah abeh just on switch on the then we are like trying to study
I think but she wasn't even doing work so it didn't bother her lah and I also think macam she
dah biasa ya and she like couldn't tell that it was like affecting me cause like maybe it does
don't want ah so rude ya some more rumah dia like I don't want to say
uh apa tu last week did you watch the soccer game
tottenham siapa eh I think
dengan siapa I don't know who then um gareth
ya then we won apa eh jap let me check the score I think it was like
ya but it was like macam last minute was like a last minute goal ya
ya nasib but we needed it because after the
second was apa eh can't remember ah maybe like
everton ke apa I don't know and then uh but only for like half an hour they were top cause they had a match with um wolves dengan
but you had school or memang takde
oh then but sampai bila
your macam when's the deadline
rabak pe
then um oh that time you mentioned kan ah yang you nak pergi tu
but okay so if borders buka pergi tak
cause sometimes like even borders buka like still doesn't mean that you know can go right
but dah buka borders belum it's still closed
but anyway um I just found out yang the international business students in my course
uh they are supposed to I think in their like third year they're supposed to go to lah to to study abeh sekarang border closed right and also the cases rising kan
then I think cause I didn't know that we have another campus kat dubai
ya I didn't know that ya so then I heard lah macam I don't know if it's true or not macam the students will go there
that's why macam tak
that's why macam like tak dengar at all right about dubai like corona cases ya so
but lucky I'm not student ah cause anyway if in in any cases macam both tak buka or both not accepting like foreigners then you waste your money right
I remember that aku teringat there's this um guy in my primary school macam he he's from new zealand ah
ya tapi dia mix macam cina ah dia cina dengan
so last time aku ada this whatsapp group
and also last time my english wasn't that good like it wasn't great lah and I like my grammar macam like
uh sembarang right ya then after that
I type something I think I type like macam
he oh sorry I typed if I'm not wrong lah maybe something like she have kan salah right ya
ya then I macam at that point of time I was like rude
a'ah mak dia masak tak lah we ordered food
ya then she was like oh malas then I was like okay lah fine just order jer
okay lah I think that time also aku dua minit abeh aku hit curb abeh dia like terus suruh balik
ya mine also mine was smooth also macam
ya or not confirm like lambat gila
ya and the pakcik
I don't know I think dia penat
uh like some allied educator dekat but it's under ah ya
it's outdoor activity macam outdoor outdoor learning ya
belum she just went for the english test
but I think the english test should be final macam like the final round I guess ya then she will know lah ya
ya then kalau she nak ajar kat secondary then kena ambil degree ah ya
I suddenly macam nak apply for
at first macam
tak my ambition eh dengar my ambition like when I was younger was to teach macam like ya like I always know oh maybe I want to become teacher whatever
and then like and then throughout mm secondary school poly macam okay not so much like not so much of like I wanna be a teacher and things like that
then suddenly but now I don't know why macam I feel that maybe being a teacher is not so bad after all
so macam like what you do
oh okay so macam for example
so for for example macam okay you like a company wants to manufacture food ah so they will come to people like you is it
oh faham faham
macam niche lah right ya baik ah
oh anyway ya speaking of becoming a teacher like the whole point I feel that a career should be fulfilling right macam
I don't want to just ya like I don't want to just work for the money you know macam ambil duit abeh balik ya
as in nursing belajar nursing
but to be honest macam just take one thing at a time ah
ya I mean and she baru start kerja
exactly abeh nak ambil nursing
but it's tough lah I mean it's ya it's banyak nak kena fikir
no as in aku tahu ah
not in the in that regard but macam
don't know kalau don't know if like it's the right choice or not ya
so did you apply for the for the madrasah course
ilmu ilmu apa eh pengetahuan dunia dan akhirat ah gitu
and kebanyakan macam orang
duh but orang muda ya macam our age ah
it's not a syarahan it's really macam kau belajar buku like all the buku tak tahu lah dia like macam ada banyak banyak buku
kitab sure like okay sure ya
but interesting lah ya macam some like you never know that there are things that there are more things to be explored ya
macam sometimes the things that you know you think you know actually you don't know
ya so and it's interesting ah and the ustad funny
macam he's like the abang-abang type dia macam just buat kelakar ah like every single every single lesson
not we are not rapat lah but macam
as in like it's not like we talk everyday ke apa
ah ya like ya we are just no but serious macam in the whatsapp group like everyone's just like nice to each other lah ya
because macam not that productive
oh abeh
it's recorded ya so macam what's the point
if you wanna sit in abeh some of the students tanya banyak soalan and they can take up like twenty minutes you know just asking
cause I remember I was rewatching uh one of the videos kan as it dia macam just tanya for like like twenty minutes non stop
abeh lecturer dia boleh layan and he's a he's an old man lah so of course lah macam I think dia macam like
ambil hati and he would he will also macam just jawab lah all of apa dia punya questions
ya so ya it's damn unproductive lah but then again macam if go back on campus lessons only like tiga jam
but malas ya and jauh jauh seh tempat dia
but I tried going to campus before aku naik train
ya abeh kena stop ah dekat
ah boleh ah no
lupa ah lupa
tak pernah pergi but that time once I went there aku stop dekat I think bugis
err tak I stop at bugis abeh tukar
ya duh takkan I stop at bugis sia abeh kena naik bus
so but to be honest my dad said that like kalau my apa my kakak dapat then my dad will belikan kereta
just change ah macam siapa siapa like I don't know like depends on our schedule
no lah for what balik ah
ya fikir ah
but jauh naik public bus
satu kat kan
abeh the other one
but tadi I not tadi lah the other day I took train macam semua orang like rapat-rapat
ya no but there was like social distancing in the cabin macam they separate with those things
ya and then they remove like I think belum lagi phase two then they remove
macam just because like oh decrease ye ye o jer abeh tak ye ye o seh
mm kat mana
no tak cause that time I like aku lapar gila at like two and I want to order ah abeh like closed ya
no like macam ya
it has been right ya I get I think macam cause COVID abeh dia orang tukar
but that time aku pergi raimah dengan kawan aku
malam ah ya and it was like damn crowded then I was like oh I should have known ya
no but uh dia nak lepak that's why ya
then where macam like kat rumah kau ada tempat makan
but ya your place macam takde tempat like makan right
oh kopitiam macam masih ada apa
kat like your area
oh oh takde macam mama mama shop gitu eh oh
then besok kau buat apa
eh lah kau buat
oh wait so it's macam ah grab oh
ya but I think aku macam now that I'm schooling tak payah kerja ah
because susah apa
penat and also I'm not doing well in school
it's not I punya tak tahu jaga masa ah ya
not continue but like macam
aku rasa macam like everyone
macam lepak kat rumah all then so you don't feel guilty that you are doing the same
I don't know kemas rumah serious macam every single day I just like kemas rumah
like macam satu dua hari abeh macam last
no lah but now aku try ah macam exercise
no because macam okay that time I remember I was like
ya then my like my muka breakout seh macam
ya my muka breakout then also macam
ya right tadi you keluar
macam that's important
um ya nak besok
start sekolah
start oh tak
kan ikut time macam ya
dia orang ikut ah dia orang punya punya
I don't know I don't think so takde pun
I'm curious now how come takde eh
then your school macam usually is it two weeks
baik pe
penat seh I didn't know uni was this difficult
macam in like after after I finish working lah that
kan abang aku tinggal kat situ ya like macam just visit dia ah
tak um brisbane
ya but boleh drive to gold coast ah ya
but uh on the left or right dia punya driving
ayah aku just uh apa drive ah kat situ ya
and it quite easy macam I see lah I think it's quite easy
kat singapore tak boleh
kat singapore tak boleh
ada pe
sentosa ada pe
tak tahu rope eh
dekat kallang ada
oh ya life jacket kau nak pakai life guard
yes I did yang my dad even showed me a photo
are you serious seram pe
ya but I read somewhere macam
let's not look at western countries as like good places that like we can retire or stay you know what I mean macam ya
no I ya I ask her no I think I was like telling her lah macam oh I'm not so sure what I want to do with my life then she was like okay do you want to stay in singapore or like overseas
and then she was like okay for me I know that I don't want to stay in singapore that's why I study in cause I think she have plans lah to stay there ke apa
and I was like oh okay cool I mean bapa kau ada duit lah so boleh hantar kau belajar luar negeri
because macam our like surrounding countries like asian countries
macam for what
ah it's it just doesn't make sense to me macam
as in macam safety
and also macam when you settle down obviously macam you have family education here is much more better
much more better eh much better singlish betul
tak tahu ah dia orang nak relax ke
ya I think honestly I think they just macam nak that like macam kampung kampung ya they just want that ya that kampung vibes honestly
but my dad always like wish that he has a kampung to go back to
ya but I don't have but I do have like macam
um apa malaysian relatives lah then when we visit them during hari raya or whatever but now since like COVID cannot visit them
right macam okay lah
I think dia macam just nak experience not for youtube I think dia memang you know sometimes you have those kind of people that just wanna live off the grid
ya I'm like macam don't post lah if you're living alone quite dangerous what
you know what I mean macam any people can like if they know where exactly you're living like ya so scary
but berani ah dia tinggal kat kat hutan
probably ada apa permit ya
masak ah kat rumah mak kau suruh masak kat rumah tak nak
I I don't know ah for me macam aku tak suka um
but I don't know ah macam
western but macam I don't know
ya but europe macam quite dangerous now right ya
mm kalau I mean like
ya and the country also macam is it easy
but like like I said macam religion is the most important part lah so macam kalau
aku boleh like beribadah
but as in like he's he's okay lah gatal
guys kelakar or not
like macam he recognises the fact that he needs to relate to his audience
rabak seh
damn rabak
ya and then macam
ah best friend dia
I don't know but they say tottenham ada chance
but I don't want to jinx it to be honest because every time macam the fans cakap oh macam eh kita boleh menang abeh like always something else happens
and liverpool oh and also liverpool ada banyak players injured
so I think right macam this is a good time for other teams to step up
ya serious and like if they don't macam it's just a waste
see tengok man U is fourteen in premier league
jap aku ada extension
kau memang itu uh I mean do you subscribe to premier league
oh wait so now takde match ah
ya I just I just perasan
ada lah
ya of course ada
abeh kau menang eh babe sorry what
oh yang kau uh
tepi jalan kan
as in like they abeh ada satu pakcik tolong kau right ya
oh abeh kau lambat
tak I don't think so I think that's memang and it makes sense ya
park the bus lagi
oh okay kesiannya
oh sedihnya
tak nak join ah
takpe lah
it's a mood it's a mood dia tinggal dekat uh
oh itu jauh babe jauhnya ya allah
and then yes nak try sangat ah try dua-dua sekali lah
why not and so entah macam dah try dua dua dah cukup ah
dah dan rasa okay lah dah dah puas then I I
um cari jodoh cari jodoh who is next
I was like please please kakak you don't have anybody let me just try for for one hour
no no no no no no sabar sabar no no okay so the the um
I downloaded for her Muzmatch kan can so we just wanted to see how the app works right and so like we never put anything about her tau like macam
gambar nama jer like we never add in anything in her bio her profile or whatsoever and then after that um
err upload lepas like bila-bila masa ah
tak payah terus upload
yes ya you try you can just try now after that lepas tu like she just delete but then she still receives like emails from cross match cause it doesn't entirely
delete your account it just delete like it just delete the apps on your phone lor then macam the account is still there there's something about you what
kalau let's say you nak nampak more calon kan
he was cute he was cute tapi kan
orang-orang kat sana kan is really looking for
in dia punya database include international people
macam like
yes what what is that yes tapi kena bayar
to show that you are really serious and not like having fun you know that playing around Muzmatch tak payah
like I'm not the kind who superficially macam oh if you give me this this things about you list me this things about you then okay
no lah I mean sometimes dia orang K when I say dia orang serious kan it's like dia orang betul-betul serious want to put themselves out there
ya like it really just depends on your rezeki I guess
ah itu lah
oh ya ya ya ya but like first date you terus want to pergi trekking
sebab you duduk side by side
jangan date orang gatal
okay ya I agree with you pasal the movie like
kalau tengok movie tak boleh berbual and then you
buang masa like if it's a date like like first date you know that you buang masa like dua jam tak berbual then like
if you going out to makan and everything
uh no I feel like trekking nanti um
macam very superficial ya first ideal date ah I feel like
and then like dia orang masak sendiri you know and like so cute then they have like those picnic baskets and then like oh ya it's so cute
the mat tikar flat lay yes yes yes yes
ya so macam if you think like those cerita like or like I don't know like macam
but what if like the guy betul-betul macam very disgusting very rude
um so I I suddenly remember pasal you did you watch the smart local ya
by um catfish K catfish tu bukan kucing ikan okay tapi so basically like
ya do you watch like the netflix punya ha what's the
and then they will have like conversations bukan bukan it's not a cerita it's like dating reality
sekejap eh
many couples right only two got married tak salah I
I have but I have a lot of my batch mates dia orang dah beli you know
so it was about this article about this um malay muslim lady who decided to make halal mooncakes because
there are a lot of halal mooncakes in singapore and then her caption was like you suppose to hiatus already his her caption was
dia orang tak sedar diri oh my god
then kalau let's say kalau kita bilang dia orang kan oh
korang ada chinese privilege or whatever kan dia orang macam
kecil hati oh mana ada mana ada korang korang ni just oversensitive lah
I pernah ada kawan ni
dia tak percaya chinese privilege exists in singapore
tak tahu because is is okay
so dia betul-betul tak percaya tau chinese privilege exists
habis dia dia buat this long twitter thread pasal
it doesn't exist pasal oh um
budak-budak melayu tak bayar school fees untuk sekolah it's very very cheap compared to budak-budak lain
dia betul-betul usaha tau untuk
it's uh uh oh my god when I read it I was like K lah buang masa jer lah I baca tak ada apa-apa it's okay thank you very much
so kesimpulannya
awak a'ah yang
tak kisah pasal um
I think like dulu um
thursday asal
interview like the teaching like the macam mana
for a lot of times sebelum final like final year lepas dia dah graduate baru dia orang terima dia
kalau tak selepas dia cuba tiga empat kali tak salah
like setiap tahun dia cuba
oh bukan
medium or kecil
oh tak ya
oh tiger no tiger besar ah ee
cute gila
oh ada
oh is it the kind that you duduk dalam haiwan ya ya ya ya I think that's better honestly
kita orang yang patut dalam this cage sangkar
sejuk eh dua minggu lepas
err I pergi river safari with my family
boring to be honest uh is like the word like it it was kind of dumb cause kita orang kena bayar
untuk masuk the boar rides five dollars
they don't have the crews anymore so then the boats then kita orang pergi naik it just like a short it's like macam
ya kita kena bayar five dollars but besides that everything is like
kai kai masih makan jumpa makan makan makan
habis dia makan ya
so dia pun pregnant lah
oh ya dia makan banyak tau tapi yang the pregnant
ya so then the apa tu err
err kai jia kai kai kai kai dia asyik makan tau dia habis makan satu bamboo stick panjang kan
selepas tu dia dia crawl dia ambil lagi lepas tu dia patahkan dia makan lagi
the whole time dia just makan tau I was there for a good ten to fifteen minutes I just watch
eating and eating my god dia orang cute gila
uh apa tu apa tu kucing and also you know those macam couple couple buat video
no it's not it's because kita orang asyik tengok some videos pasal couple couple so the algorithm just
macam sedih kan
ya but like I feel sometimes dia orang post benda yang
should have just kept it to themselves macam something not everything other people should be
like something are just so intimate macam I recently saw this video pasal
oh um dia went through
miscarriage and then dia punya
teman lelaki tengah nangis on the bed dan macam dia tengah comfort teman lelaki dia I think
a bit dia ambil video on this stuff dia macam saja nak post jer then I am just like this kind of things in life are
uh I like when I watch videos macam dia orang
tunjuk dia orang pergi on dates tunjuk orang buat begini begitu cute cute
apa ah apa challenge
husband bila dah nikah bila ha
adam apa siapa tu uh huh
pelamin dia kat rumah eh
nak tahu ah
bodoh lah
emcee cakap um mari um teman-teman dan keluarga
um semua orang sila carikan pengantin pengantin perempuan hilang
oh my god that time my sister pergi kawan dia punya kakak
um majlis perkahwinan then it was cantik gila dia tepi laut and
it's it's not open dia bukan takde shelter it's sheltered cuma tapi dia macam how to say uh it's like kampung style open windows so there is a shelter but it's tepi laut
like it by the beach tepi laut kind cantik gila like dia punya deco and like the view
true true kalau nanti hujan masuk confirm mahal it's definitely mahal it's a it's a well-known expensive wedding venue no no K see I have
this rule is that kalau I nak kahwin actually takde majlis pun okay actually ya

like you like if you just put it on top of your table it just looks rose gold like I don't know whether is I mata potek or like orang Apple mata potek I do not know like I genuinely don't know
so now officially girl girl is broke I dah tak ada duit I nak makan pun tak boleh you know I was like thinking of buying like
broke because the money is set aside for something what do you mean fake broke apa lan jiao kau apa merepek kau nak cari gaduh ke apa
lepas tu I
right since primary six I was primary six okay like I will like dulu kan my mum pakai tudung
so like dia pakai tudung then kalau dia nak potong rambut kan nak kena pergi to somebody's house you know to tutup aurat and all that lah
like they are like fucking far extended family kind of shit lah but like raya have to go to their house cause it's like some nenek punya nenek punya kakak punya some shit lah
like knows the auntie so like she will go like when she was younger to cut her hair then once I started like to pakai tudung in primary school my mom brought me there lah instead of like the normal kedai barber and all that
since fucking primary six sampai last year this motherfucker has been like forcing me to jadi dia punya
daughter-in-law dalam bahasa melayu apa
yes okay I keep on forgetting that word obviously menantu material right there but like she has been wanting me to be her menantu for god knows why like I'm so messed up I'm so fucked up but she still wants me to be her menantu you know dulu right when I was like like twelve nanti benda dia macam kecil jer ah macam she will be like
orh like what do you think of my anak like that like nanti aku duduk like dia kasi aku makan nanti dia cakap you think by the way his name is okay let's let's give him like give me a nice Malay name like he's actually decent looking he's not ugly
um she like ask me like what do you think of #Adi#</P2 then I'll be like like apa kau merepek like that is your son what am I actually supposed to say you know

like is always the mum and the sisters looking at me up down ketawa ketawa gelek gelek sendiri and then like he's never there
I thought about that because I think I'm just dreading next year raya and then that is one of the things that I'm dreading ah
like I tudung and all that
cause every year I go to her house and every year she will like ask me like do I have a boyfriend what do I think of her son kau nak jadi aku nya
menantu ke tak that that happened last year lah but like you know it just escalates to suddenly I'm the menantu that's all
kan I don't know it's just like a melayu nya thing
like makcik makcik be really all up in your face be like kau nak jadi aku punya err menantu ke tak
menantu like girl girl doesn't like to cook I like to bake but I don't like to cook
is that a good menantu quality like
especially if makcik got a son that is like freaky
makcik I am permanently staying here you like me right can I get married now
you nak I sekarang tak I umur baru dua puluh tapi okay dah
I okay I budak uni
I don't know what else to say I budak uni
I suka masak
like I don't know what is a good quality to be a menantu in the first place
is it so that means what when you just register straightaway kau pergi primary one like you cannot skip anything is it
tak ah the only the only madrasah that I had went to was Andalus and then it was only until like what
so I go and boleh pukimak kau dia tak tahu ke
oh my god bodoh lah so the only vocab that he knows in Malay is
and like adjectives like sedap
and lawa
gila ya the jiwang kind of shit but then doesn't actually understand what's going on
oh no the motivation is gone padahal nak cari ilmu eh okay okay sorry sorry
like I solat I got clear skin I got good grades
it is scan scan tu eh
ah lepas tu
so wait he got he tunang in twenty seventeen he putus tunang in twenty seventeen and then he go and find her again
you know you'll never know might like still sayang and like I don't know like
okay what the what the heck he's so weird you want to meet your girlfriend but then you also want to berak then you don't want to berak first and then it's just like
I don't know nak cakap childish ke nak cakap tak ada otak ke tak faham sia
like first of all you are like freaking like twenty something and then you want to berak abeh kalau kau nak berak pergi lah cari toilet yang kau nak pergi kacau kau nya girlfriend cari kan toilet buat apa siak
kay wait kau nya boyfriend jumpa mak kau sebab macam kena caught is it like like terserempak kat somewhere then she's like no
lelaki tu yang nak lelaki lelaki tu yang suggest and then she was like ya and I was just like
lan jiao I've been together with a guy for one year my mother tak tahu sia
actually I also tak faham lah
so apparently they actually stated to each other both like both of them stated to each other like I'm not gonna play around but is both of their first relationship but then they actually clearly specify I tak nak main main okay and then suddenly I tak nak main main equals to you kena jumpa mak I
so like I tak faham girl girl tak believe it
I just tak faham I was just like
was the one who told my friend like eh I want to meet your mak
I just tak tahu
like he's not the one that you marry and then korang like wah full blown invested like I don't know ah I I was just confused I never would
so this girl like freaking younger than me had a boyfriend lepas tu buka bank account
sebab nak kahwin like they actually like
dulu I would do it dulu I was that kind of girl okay I wouldn't go to the extent of like putting my money
and you know dapat
tell you so messy perangai everybody semua perangai macam sial
I really never tried blue coral my entire life but everytime a Melayu comes by
I never tried it before but like the Melayu right god like the typical like if the Chinese walk pass you know they're gonna be like peach green tea lah the normal milk tea the Malays if they come right jesus christ they're gonna make me do ice blended at the back and be like blue coral smoothie chocolate oreo
the ice blend and I'm just like alamak makcik like I know lah like
or chocolate oreo like you the melayu the makcik be like
I mean KOI punya milk tea already nice
huh why you talking about milk tea and I want sushi so bad like girl girl nak sushi tapi girl girl tak ada duit
why is sushi expensive like why like kenapa
like they come dengan beras
mahal lah but like
nya sushi
shit lah like the sushi at eh not Sushi Express what is it ah dulu at junction eight ada
oh yeah talking about your madrasah
at the start I went to a masjid madrasah for awhile only like
masjid Ahmad Ibrahim
the baju is green colour and then my tudung is yellow in colour so maybe that's where my name like nyonya telur came about cause girl girl imagine with that circle face and then the yellow tudung really not cute
the sekolah is in the middle of like a hutan
like then next day they went and like find out who the guy who the guy is like siapa lelaki yang cium anak aku you know it's like maybe I don't know
my yayi and my mum pergi ah pergi to the masjid and then after that they actually like found out the the guy that kiss me
it was so messy and then like I was just like I don't even know how he looks like you know sekarang I cannot remember like I cannot remember anything
they will just say you know lelaki yang cium #Syafiqah#</P2 kat madrasah
you know dia literally casually called the dude that name and apparently that he's still in my life
but I don't know who he is I've never seen him before but his name will pop out like my nyai will like talk about it to my mum
to tell her which is just I just waddle waddle up and then be like mama mama ah ada orang cium #Iqah#</P2 kat pipi and then I like went like this to my cheeks and all that and then my mother was like what the fuck is going on
and then my mum went down the next day with my nyai to go and see the guy and then apparently the guy like people will fetch your child what cause it's like in a ulu place
then when like I was maybe I pointed to the guy or something and then the guy was with the mum and then the mum barely knows my nyai
I cannot believe it ni perangai
bakal nak jadi menantu orang you know this is the perangai that it perangai
ya I almost said mertua this is why I cannot be nobody's menantu when I cannot even say menantu correctly
a'ah sia I cannot believe it that I actually took higher Malay sekarang melayu berterabur
berterabur baby berterabur
boy dia
mana lah aku tahu
like you nak datang rumah I ke tak you datang lah Mai</P2 lah is it
sampai macam gitu sekali ah like nak kena pakai voice note and all
cepatnya dia punya story travel
asal dia tak happy jer ke or what like what what's going on like is she not happy or like
wah shit sia I'm still damn salty about it like can you believe it sampai sekarang sia I'm just like so tilted
motor be like on the road malam malam buta baby who you fetching is it me I pun nak ikut
but really though naik motor is really fun like it's actually really fun
like the last time I naik motor was this guy who fetch me from work
I've seen so many photos of new zealand in like postcards and I was gila seh
ya bila lah boleh travel lagi macam camper van was so nice right I mean like it's a different form of travelling
bila time nak makan we can makan or like we can just stop whenever we wanna rest
what fifty plus lima puluh
sabar sabar sabar he actually did it
pergi pub eh pergi pub hot chocolate wow
eh so was the first time that you felt snow or macam how was it ah macam sejuk gila ke or like how was it
oh okay eh tapi dalam cuaca macam gitu sejuk-sejuk ah I think it'll be so nice to have a hot drink right macam hot chocolate or like
eh hot chocolate dekat
yup yup correct ah rindu seh tu
yang the one you remember the wombats there were wombats around us there were wildlife around us
ya and then bila wombat tu macam bau kita punya makanan wah he just like crawled up to our door
ya eh how come tak ambil gambar seh
tu ah kecoh saje
for a moment I was thinking like should I throw my pan out of the door so that they can eat outside you know because like kesian when when I saw them at the door they look like so hungry and I don't know like like I just felt like I needed to feed it to feed them
ah lepas COVID pergi mana eh
dia penat gila ah you have to break and make lots of stops right
ya I really hope this goes away soon seh K tak sabar
you can actually leave your car over there kan macam
so macam like that time when we went to tasmania right like we'd I think we got on all kinds of transport ah there was car
tapi rasa macam you macam boring gitu
eh selamat tak seasick eh
weirdly I miss the supermarkets kelakar kan kelakar tak
they are just so lain right
ya lah that's one of our ways that kita nak save duit kan
I don't know I rasa apa dah pakai
err wait err K let me recall eh van diemen's was the one yang kat farm right
and then there was gelato messina which was dekat bandar like the city area
and gelato messina was eh what flavours were there lupa ah
farm and natural kind of flavours like the berries pepperberry and macam all those like fruity kind of flavors but gelato messina was like hip ah macam modern
so macam um I don't know eh
eh amorino yang mana satu seh
yes yes I remember amorino was the one where they shape the ice cream macam bunga like that macam the petals was that the one
yup you know that one ya that was but macam tak memorable sangat ah
uh oh it's a tough one err macam mana eh err
tak I'm sure you like my messina better right
pening seh I tengok
okay to each their own okay to each their own but tom's palette cause they have like local flavours ah macam
macam there's raclette cheese in remember ya that was good ah that's not something that's easily found here
eh but is it because is it because it was very cold over there so macam you know the experience of eating when it's cold and you're lapar like that just makes you feel that it's the best thing ever
borong market okay trying to remember
macam it wasn't it wasn't like popular or macam ya it wasn't like the it wasn't trending yet lah basically
like I remember there was one macam
apa eh flavour ni macam some honeycomb thingy right
pisang goreng is it pisang goreng
macam they said that it was pisang muda goreng or something like that
eh eh mana nak dapat ah
like I remember we came for souvenirs or something else lah like an exhibition or something but we chanced upon the food like the food stalls right ya like we didn't task was really like we didn't even know about the brownie sebelum tu apa
what's dragon's den tak pernah dengar seh
ini macam shark tank ke apa
oh macam like the article like she published or something eh
miss all the good food seh overseas but I miss um ya I miss that we had to be resourceful also overseas macam masak sendiri and all kan
I do I do like macam
apa eh for example prata probably like we would actually
trying to find a prata shop or teh tarik shop and pay an exorbitant amount untuk beli just to macam
just because you were craving and you didn't have it back then kan ya tu ah
entah ah maybe like it's the circumstances that made us miss food and therefore we feel that the food that we had overseas was so much nicer than kat sini
kau singapore pun ada seh
what was so nice about it ah was it like the spices or apa apa yang sedap sangat ah
livable boy sama makan sama hidup eh
sedap kan like apa eh what do we have shepherd's pie ah
and then um ya like we shared quite a bit ah we went there I think malam eh
tu ah tak ingat ah
wah rindu gila seh
um let me see there was very nice milkshake and jacket potatoes kat
sedap kan like
like like I didn't even know something macam so basic and simple can taste so sedap you know what I mean
ya milkshake and skittles and wait apa what was the filling dalam jacket potato dia lupa ah
ya macam I don't think it was tuna what was it ah just like sour cream eh it was ya something like really simple but remember kita order lepas tu kita order lagi lepas tu ya it was that good ah
ya like it's so ya I don't know robably like ya like you said ah before the freshness of the produce and macam ya things are just
so many things to miss about being overseas apa lah yang kita boleh buat kat singapore sekarang
ya lah that one standard ah standby duit jer
macam ya you really save more I mean provided you have the money lah but you really in terms of the price you you do save more and ya I mean people really like to go into stores pasal dia orang suka touch and feel the bags ya the shopping experience err like it's over there it's like
yang unbeatable lah and ya you I think
it's not just one brand tapi macam berlambak ah brand
bukan bicester
okay can you jog my memory again york mana satu
okay lah just want to check it out while we are there betul aqilah
so right what eh did we go to any theme parks ah kat sana like I can't remember like during our trip
ya only only that one err that one place ingat tak tempat tu apa tu nama dia
yang ada the one with the that float what do you call it ah
the one that we sat on the float and then like we slide down the slope apa eh what is it called ah
ya but basically there was that fun huge float kita duduk kat dalam lepas tu we just slide down the slope ya get it is it
ya that was nice and then that was this um eh mahal eh
berapa ah berapa seh
I think kita ada masuk macam some maze thingy right

bila seh how come I don't know
ni time uni eh
but err tu ah like last time I never had a chance to travel as a student so like how how different was it travelling like as a student compared to you know when you're working and you have like more money and stuff
like I am sure you had to save up to do certain thing I mean macam you've got to plan around your budget and everything kan
jauh gila eh

confirm tengah panic eh pasal macam dah lah lambat then you have to find your gate and everything like oh my goodness
macam macam what what would err the like significant moments of the trip
oh selamat ah spain menang

kalau dia orang ada siesta if they had a siesta like will they then open their shops until it after they reopen okay lah then that's not so bad lah
masih ah madrid
he pernah kerja at malaysia or singapore is it

ah okay okay dia ada rumah ada rumah
oh yang yang that time tu dia kata ah socially constructed
apa ah what was it ah
macam make you make you wow gitu ah
asal asal still kena cause kau jiwa melayu apa
okay like in the future I kau
tapi like um
ah kalau macam like
um mix ah apa mixed racial marriages gitu kan then anak anak dorang semua mixed like muka campur gitu ah then
ya lah then it will never never end what gitu
apa sia lapan bangsa from where
like you are only from your mum and dad pe tak kan like you want to kira your nenek moyang semua
tak ada kau kata like it's not um
like it's not fair for like kids to have as if not fair for people to get based on their dad's punya race eh tapi at the same time kau kata like they shouldn't choose so
like kalau
okay kalau kau chindian kan like chinese indian then you want to buy a house then you know cause of the race racial apa tu the quota that one right
cause like kalau this one
dorang dah ramai gila cina
so kalau kau chindian then kau identify your like you can choose right then you identify yourself as indian then you can take but if you identify yourself as chinese then you cannot take cause
a'ah I I don't know if like we can jual like jual to melayu eh jual to india or not
then I know like you have to jual to like
uh it's like a social social inequality cause kita minorities selalu
okay ah I don't want to say selalu cause it's too like absolute but
uh banyak kali
chey dipinggir yes ya yes ya
ya dipinggir is like ah macam jadi outlier gitu kan
um honestly aku rasa
so aku rasa macam
cause kalau tak ada quota ni semua kan confirm there's like racial different like racial segregation ah cause like macam
kau imagine ah woodlands confirm kampung melayu sia woodlands yishun
yishun tak sangat yishun maybe like yishun maybe like chinese a bit ada indian aku tak tahu
eh eh kau takmo
yeah um abeh punggol probably
I don't know macam cina maybe
this like racial quota right is only applicable to public housing so macam all those like private private properties semua kan macam like rumah sebuah sebuah semua
dorang tak ada seh that's why like they can get away with all this like
ah like segregation so it's like in private housing private housing there's like the kau tahu macam dorm
that foreign foreign workers punya dorm so it's like
like ah for workers and from china semua they live together then from india bangladesh semua live together since like the segregation is there already and then also like in in like
um expats ah macam those orang putih then they tend to live in like bigger houses pe so there's the macam they are quite detached from our society
eh diam lah eh yes yes
um like I want the windows to be like top down kind ah macam macam gini ah and also I want a balcony that can look outside like can sit outside kind
then like malam malam boleh just
ada some ada some
kat mana seh

okay faham faham
ada those kinds ah but I don't think ada lah so but priority is just like um balcony ada balcony and like with a nice view and like not the kind yang macam kau tengok luar is then is the the
skyscrapers all those right it's like kau tengok luar lepastu
ah not laut lah but more of
um like pokok pokok also
then like it's like the balcony not macam balcony boleh letak kerusi
but I don't think ada but um private private housing also ada
asal takut eh takut hantu
oh okay ada pe playground kat macam serangoon gardens semua ada playground apa

cause I macam like you know
true true then macam how to say ah
uh so macam
in a way macam same thing as um
uh so macam meet client then um got assessment then lepas itu
then macam apa itu my office is literally macam just beside the units where they live so macam kalau dia orang nak apa-apa then they will come over knock on the door but it's not twenty four seven lah
ya lah okay lah existing cases tapi macam apa itu
because sekarang macam buat split teams kan then it's like there's two offices we're like we're not supposed to cross then we handle macam cuma two units each lah so kita punya outside unfortunately macam banyak
err like we face shortage of manpower lah macam cause um this the err
cannot remember her title but the my supervisor she's actually she's in charge of two programs lah macam two services so dia kesian gila lah like she has to run back and like she has to toggle between both
and at that time bila phase two right she couldn't meet the other program so she has to run everything at
so uh so then macam then she also has to handle the clients kan the office the the program that I am in and then the other program she err she also has to attend to the matters there lah so macam double work
ah so she kesian ah
then baru sahaja recently another staff left ya cause
it's not pasal itu lah like I think we don't want to take up social work then like there's just no one else to go
but I don't know lah kalau macam
err yesterday I meet up with the um lah then dia tanya I like kalau do you prefer to are you okay to work
she added lah if I want to come to the company and work then macam I don't know what program lah ada satu program ini dia hey just started up their office is in simei which is like great lah macam very near my house
I realised my tempat kerja dan tempat semua macam jauh gila ya
full time lah macam err how to say ah they ask me to apply tapi macam a bit weird lah macam I was telling one of the colleague macam the colleague there lah the staff there there was like
then uh what macam um so weird cause they already asked me a lot of questions and they already know me
and then I think the uh my my um the staff there cakap uh the is the one you are interview lah
then macam like so weird the is actually my technically my supervisor lah then then she on the first day I came in for my macam meet up session dengan dia and my reporting officer
sampai padahal they just want to get to know me better lah
so cute ah then she ask me lah macam like you can go this option this option then apa itu
um then she ask me if I want to continue working lah at the same place yang I buat internship itu then I macam err not sure lah like a bit too far lah but
I guess it makes sense lah for me to macam continue there cause I know the staff there I know like half the clients there
then macam in terms of macam you know blend in with the team gitu like they know it's going to work
I think internally adalah macam issue sikit lah cause dia dah macam cause ada change kan so macam the difference in mm apa power dynamics I guess much macam mm
my the reporting officer she's actually supposed to be macam less
err hands on but I think because of the split teams and everything and then she couldn't meet with the other program kan so macam dia um just suppose head of the homes is actually macam a bit restricted lah
haiya he's like he's the one yang actually main person to do the homes and everything but because um the assistant
ya she's the assistant director then she is there and then macam like dia dah lama dengan kita lah she already do this kind of this job so macam when she comes in and station kan the office gitu kan so err I think he feels a bit restricted lah
ya ya can tell sikit lah
macam I think dia macam like some of the things he didn't agreed with and then macam cause he got his own way of doing things then macam like he doesn't think that we should do this but err in a way
uh then macam like ya then macam at the end of the day macam like I dengar two things ah like I think dia pun macam segan and come up to me and then talk to me about certain things and then I macam uh then macam at the end of the day dia cakap lah like I'm not trying to supervise you
but um this is how it's going to work lah this is how I we used to do it lah so macam I macam caught in tau
so like uh macam am I talking too much
ya macam like this client he came back from hospital then dia pakai taxi then he kept asking lah
lepas itu err I want to
err be refunded by for my cab then apa itu dia cakap
apa itu I put in a group chat lah where everyone can read and then the assistant director said
so then after I uh I got the message then the head of the homes came and then cakap lah like okay this is for to build independence why does he not have enough money to pay for a cab fare then I macam like what what is going on
ya and then macam like it felt weird like macam apa
like dia orang punya procedure in a way like try to solve it internally call
ya so like macam I felt a bit err and then still some more like sometimes
the like I'm macam
I guess macam dia orang treat me a bit like staff there lah which I understand ah macam like
I don't know how they treat their other interns but I think bila yesterday too when I met up with my reporting officer and supervisor she said like I she she thinks that they like I'm treated a bit like staff lah macam they they allow me to do a lot of things
I I felt like macam still terikat lah like if I was the actual staff and case manager like a lot of the things macam I tak check in sangat lah like I would have just check in a bit then I would have run with it lah but macam
uh macam as a intern you realise that what you doing
will have an impact on like the other case workers so macam like I hold back and then like I keep checking in so macam in a way to protect myself and also like to make sure like the client tidak ada
so macam two and a half months actually quite short lah
ada one satu grad dip then the other is I think um under grad but err it's her second practicum
uh so I think this company macam purposely they take up err
they tried to pick up macam grad dip yang pernah kerja
ya ya in the social service sector so that macam mm not train lah macam like you know uh
work etiquette ah work etiquette macam like organisation after awhile macam a lot of organization macam structured a certain way
and then macam there's like cause I know lah macam like there's policy there's guidelines macam there's to meet gitu so macam like I roughly know lah
ya so I kind of know lah punya mentality where they go they a bit
they are a bit macam
jaga muka jaga face sikit like macam they expect
I guess like macam when you work with people it's not easy to see a change very fast kan ya so macam some of them macam resistant some of them macam they are forced to go into the service because of what they they did are like
or macam the society or the community macam thinks of them that that there's an issue with them so they report lah to government or which is lah can trickle down to usually lah cause they always report to lah
so then anything raise up lah then blah blah blah nanti in the end turun to the organisation so then they expect organisation
so macam be miracle lah miracle workers then kita cakap dengan dia orang lah it's not possible they don't see it as a problem you see it as a problem and most of the time dia orang pun tak nak someone to come in and interfere with their private affairs
and then macam how to say
dia orang punya is a bit merepek lah at times I feel
cannot be that macam one case worker has to hold maybe around
err I think last time apa eh eighty cases
ya actually ya actually initially they wanted according to my reporting officer lah they wanted I think hundred I was like kalau hundred one case sahaja can be like besar gila because of their complications is are they
someone who is very minimal macam susah gila it's because like it comes and goes ah each person kadang-kadang this period they are okay some periods not and then also macam seasonal you see cause sometimes like
I I think depending on the timing like macam chinese new year or christmas timing right they will there's like explosion of things going on cause macam I think macam
how to say macam it ties into their
so dia teringat-ingat the families ah or what how is your relationship with their family lah that kind of thing
you ketawa
for like uh macam reporting period lah ya then macam
but I think macam they try to push lah macam reduce the amount first of all and then second it cannot be that macam is singular case work lah it must macam kita buat group work or something considered under the lah because macam
it's try lah they try to lah maximum I think thirty to forty lah but then nowadays ah cases macam complicated you the person itself is not alone kan then you have to look at the family like the community setting
so macam orang dekat atas tak faham orang dekat bawah
and apa
I might lah I I will I will look through the simei one is a new program it it seems like macam um a a duplication of some of their services so macam like
I ask them ah what is it about this new program that you want to start uh new siting cause macam I think they try to ask different people to build up the team from like previously the different programs lah
err I think the cases all the cases in the east to be transferred lah so then what's the macam main difference lah between the other programs
so it doesn't ya it still sounds very um macam apa exploratory
oh no no there's no need to itu I have to I apply the usual route lah
macam I'm not in the headspace to cari kerja sekarang
I don't know if I want to just continue doing my masters ke tak next year is like I I feel macam
it's not that lah I macam don't know where to go yet I don't know if macam is the place for me to do masters like macam after one year one point five years of doing grad dip kan macam like
is it a good place to start like to study lah macam their profs are good and everything but macam ada I don't know lah what I want to take up the extra curricular modules and then if I want to take up continuing masters in social work
uh I think I macam orang gatal sikit macam I cannot
think what about your current job yang yang part time how is it so far
so you have to be firm and you have to macam how to say
approachable macam like you don't be the too nice person is usually is all strict first
then afterwards macam like then they say you strict right then they respect then you come in and be nice
it's the little things lah you cannot macam force your way into it like macam like
whatever you say you keep to it then they will respect you even macam as young as two they will remember especially kids ah they will remember
alamak teruk lah ya
I don't know I I want to do it that time then I think I had to cancel my appointment cause siapa eh can't remember so I had it was a a clash then I tried to reschedule then after that circuit breaker then my mum pernah buat ya ya actually I want she okay sahaja
but I I tak
so I wanted to go again then I terlupa then a lot of things happen kan then ya you know orh this year is like a very um happening year for me
on monday tapi dekat mana
tempat itu jauh jauh seh for me
is it not the darah one right
ya my mum advised me to go for the darah one cause apa itu
ya so she asked me to go for the darah one she went for the darah one also actually
you my apa eh
I can't remember what my mum told me tapi dia cakap macam you can you kalau nak ikut sunnah itu you follow which day eh
no monday ke thursday tak ingat but definitely not friday ya
ah but she went for it but macam yang this one this lady dia buat itu the female one she she she lives in tampines ah then she she part time major
think ya ya buat dekat rumah dia
I tak ingat err
I book I book the itu then I
macam normal lah tak won't break your bank kind of situation lah
uh no my mum okay sahaja lepas bekam
at least you don't transcribe yourself I I was apa itu part of my assignment one of it is macam to do process recordings lah then I kena record myself with a conversation with a client
it was so cringey then I heard myself cause it's macam I pakai mask kan and then I have to macam analyse lah everything that I do with the client then I was like so uh I hate this I hate this like interview so long thirty plus
ya I know I think ya I think when I heard my uh voice macam like apa itu macam way lower then macam
uh macam
the normal normal high pitch I think I realised my voice is the lower register and then macam calm like more huh not calmer lah macam
then will be like kenapa hujan siapa nyanyi
mm no ah it just sounds normal to me ya I I don't know lah macam ada ya
I think I don't know lah macam something to do with our ears like usually when we
voice macam I think it's the um channel that they go into so macam when we hear our voices during our
apa itu using recording ke apa right ya it sounds weird net factor
can't imagine we apa itu sekarang what maybe they gonna do some space travel kan tak sampai ingat who is it ah the guy yang faizal tak suka itu no
okay okay can lah I don't mind cause technically macam it's either
macam no err no macam
parkway parade or like you know north east region gitu
actually macam ya in terms of connectivity macam cycling I think in the east is better
eh there is a dekat tampines there's a eco green park town
eh I is this the guy yang you were the one that ya the one that you macam not certain is it this one
ya lah it makes more sense lah habis itu ya
then sometime macam like kalau the girl moves into the guy's house is sometimes macam
uh ada lah fiction you pernah dengar
outside you and the mother-in-law macam okay lah bermesra gitu but
I think macam like entah what would what would I know also
tak macam ada like female macam ada expectations on us like we should tak kisah lah kalau you kerja full time couple like you're supposed to help out
at the house then macam like the opposite doesn't hold true if like the guy moves into the house like you still have
mm like macam apa itu
like you don't expect the husband to like do so much of like housework or anything is macam financially sahaja lah kasih duit
but nowadays is like susah lah nak
I know which is like macam a bit worrying lah macam I think I tengah fikir-fikir because macam
like I also don't want to send like any potential kids to infant care or childcare cause macam at the end of the day the kids how they turn out is supposed to be your responsibility kan but then also
like you shouldn't segan and not ask for help and then my mm then my parents dia orang tak nak macam they want to have their own lives lah they don't want to be like you know
it's like the only other options I can see is that I macam berhenti kerja sekejap lah jaga anak and then ya and then potentially you lose
uh apa itu credibility um relevancy to the the area that you are in then susah balik nak masuk kerja
so then also like your is lower then you basically rely on your husband ah and then macam a lot of people tell me lah macam oh what uh don't rely so much on your husband try to be independent macam like what is going on
ya but at the end of the day macam but if you is good lah kalau you only want to have like one kid sahaja but then kalau you want anak kedua ketiga then when is it going to stop
ya so macam
technically kalau nak masuk playgroup lah it's a nice timing to masuk balik kerja and then
I don't know lah macam singapore punya culture not flexible yet
so macam
number one err it was very easy and simple for me to just ask about his name and full name it wasn't very macam like uh abang why you asking for my name no ah upfront telling and then even talking about his job he just explain that he used to he is in the police force and then he used to work in err
that's why lah but of course there's that connotation lah kan tapi it's not it's not really
so ah dia suka dia suka in the couch we are all sitting at the couch I was sitting at this side of the couch
he was sitting here abah was sitting at a chair that I brought for him I got zina to sit right beside me
ah that one I didn't get to ask but that one is tak tak important lah ya
so the other ah important part was about his job experience lah so he did confirm his five years then I ask him can you explain to me what how did he get to five years then he explain lah actually he was doing national service but he was waiting for he apa the the sign on agreement and it it it only came after and also that's how he got disrupted he had to go through the whole process at police again
this boy being very upfront helps the situation so that's why me and abah were very calm about it tak ada macam problematic so I spoke to them about the video thing I spoke to them that eh
ah so he told they he explain they both okay the reason why they rush for it was ah number one ah apa there was this timeline that they wanted to apply because if they don't apply they wouldn't get it at the place that they are looking for which is near their near his parents' place and then dia tinggal pasir ris
so at the end they they actually end up they they have to look for something that is resale lah because they want to look for some a place near err istighfar
because dekat um the parents place pasir ris
this is this could have been boleh fikirkan cara yang lebih baik lah kan which is to
bilang kan that you want to um do this to both your parents and zina's parents inform before you go on to doing that because what if you get that err the keys you know then what you have to actually this part abah was the one who ah already point out I just reiterated the point
nanti kan macam terdesak kan you have to like actually have to push for this ah then you are making it difficult for both sides
ah then he just he just nodded lah he he understood uh but I was still macam thinking eh do you are you apologetic or not about your your mistake here ah but I think it's in between lah it's in between that apologetic but also macam like okay
so his from his stand is like no harm no foul can cancel what begitu I say it's not about that lah it's about you informing do it properly
ah then I then I also talk to them lah like okay want then I want to hear what is his plan abah also want to hear what is his apa dia punya rancangan lah
um then it was very clear rancangan is that
the next year somewhere dalam march they intend to tunang dengan zina
the guy was saying ya so there's that and then probably meeting up the parents that means his parents to come and meet abah probably in december so that they give them some at least a few months before the engagement lah
the nikah would be in twenty twenty two end of twenty twenty two
at least ada
ah then okay then at least say that gives proper time lah for you to both look at how you gonna plan this then I say then the abah was saying you know zina just got
err just finish studying jadi apa the plan in these two years for for her uh then this azram cakap oh ya uh this is to would be
ya because he and then he explained it before before I even need to talk about macam like the financial burden because he said ya definitely it's not enough just for me zina also needs to work to build up a
that's why it's very easy because he seems to know the have a plan and he seems to okay so that's why macam it was a easy session because he was very clear and very direct and it was simple tak payah tak ada complication
and I and I pun cakap dengan dia lah that
you nak kena
dia zina pun nak kena grow up
asing asing asing masing-masing kena grow up tersendiri
ah so you need give that time untuk you both nak kena grow up ah that's the thing budak itu diam jer so I tak puas hati because like you can just be numb about this whole thing lah that is a which is uh quite good as you're gonna either you don't absorb or you not receiving or you rejecting so many things that can happen right just because you're keeping quiet so after that abah is there something you want to uh anything you want to ask them uh I said ya so ah let me check in um so
so one thing that I brought out is you both nak kena
tersendiri grow
memang ah nak kena apa ada this uh
grow up right memang nak kena ada grow up tapi uh growing up needs to needs perlu berada dalam
ah context apa
maksud dia has to grow up both growing up can take place both as a single and as a married couple
a bit a bit like that but also but also he's trying that uh growing up takes place both lah during single and when you get married so I said then okay then the next thing is for you guys to set out a plan on how you gonna go about this ah so I made it very clear that don't just lip service dia perlu perbincangan further you guys need to communicate I told them you guys need to communicate this further need to talk about how you gonna plan this out and then when I say communicate abah dengar ini tak mahu communicate communicate like tak boleh nak jumpa jumpa abah there's nothing wrong with communicate I said so um I think they got it lah so now it's about them solidifying this by putting out a plan
kau orang nak kena sit down nak kena plan out how to grow individually and then after that plan out how to grow together then this will work if you just gonna say ah ya lah grow grow grow but you just gonna
tak work on it you just gonna macam letak kat tepi jer and just macam put it into the back of your mind tak nak macam
apa buat kerja develop this it's not gonna work
of course I'm not macam blind to this ah
because at the end itu mama dekat kitchen and mm mama malu malu lah apa lah nanti bila kita duduk makan baru mama duduk
dayah tak ada dayah said she doesn't want to be there also lah
I didn't say sembunyi-sembunyi lah I say you have to be upfront you cannot you cannot you know be quiet about things you have to inform
body gesture and how he interact with zina he is very firm he's just firm lah it's that not say very firm lah but it's firm macam whatever zina macam nak nak tanya ah ashraf right do you want water then he will just say
very macam he won't just he won't say oh it's okay zina he he won't
so I can see ah and the way he speaks also is macam very direct and very
ya so it's not macam so as as ambiguous as it was lah at least it's kind of macam very clear at least they have a plan at least they are aware that they need to ah give zina time to work ah give zina time to develop
kita tak tanya pasal dia punya family ya I did so his father is is working as a relief taxi driver mum is not working
changi business apa changi ah ya that one ya that one warehouse lah ya so
dia macam ya macam I I don't know that
so jadi macam
then abah abah is the kind where if he's
interested in someone he will have lengthy conversations and then after that abah like talk about so many things from people to world views to politics
ya no can see that okay abah is comfortable with him already
ah that's something that they will have to macam resolve lah how but at the very least they are giving zina time to grow
and then ya like I said I got the full name got the wage it's been ah apa been attached to for the three months
ah it was okay normal not not that macam overly zealous also like
ya he was also upfront say that ah the past uh he has yet to have the chance to go for jumaat players
ever since COVID like macam basically he's just trying to share lah like you know it this is the situation for him also cause we were talking about this
the the we were talking about it wasn't like macam he just brought up we were talking about jumaat prayers and then we were sharing
ya tak payah macam pening-pening sangat
ah actually after that was a lot more interest lepas itu lagi interesting
was abah sudah sekarang tengah fikir ah ini sekarang nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah
ashraf sudah balik semua sudah balik ah ah lepas itu abah cakap nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah asyik
tolak tolak tolak semua budak ini yang terkena kan then I said abah
abah nak kena tengok eh
hidayah okay you you got two different daughters abah cakap apa different both are daughter yes both are your daughters tapi there are two different girls two different daughters
zina is on the receiving end she is zina sudah memang nak menerima
apa berkahwin hidayah I don't think she is there yet dayah belum lagi ke tahap itu
then zina pun add in ah ya but she says she wants to get married ya memang dia nak tapi is she proactive looking no what she is not if she proactive looking she would have brought up some suitors uh
then uh then I said so abah you need to understand yang ini dua anak perempuan berlainan
so abah kena recognize that and dayah is happy at where she is right now in her life okay and then I say abah macam habis kita then I say okay yes I know I I faham abah tengah risau habis macam mana now bila habis sampai bila abah kata
then abah let me give you some advice
if you nak di to even
abah err mama bila nak
calonkan or menunjukkan calon
biar quality
biar berkualiti orang orang yang abah dan mama tunjukkan semua tak ada quality dayah sendiri sudah pergi selidik of course sudah sekali dua kali sudah kena mesti dia sudah macam give up dengan mama abah punya ini pasal mama abah just throw jer ya then mama say tapi the one yang dekat australia itu abah mama tahu tak he is just a taxi driver then dayah will think macam macam bingit lah
because he actually err apa he has worked for many years and he doesn't want to work anymore so he with all the wealth he accumulated he bought a house and he started to sewakan rumah ini so his earnings from the rental ya but the point is
itu lah yang aku cakap
that's why I say cari orang berkualiti berkualiti is not just about
ya so anyway jadi macam
abah understood that lah I said abah tak boleh control apa dayah nak ini
abah boleh control kalau abah nak sangat carikan calon abah boleh control itu itu yang abah boleh control
so I said right now it seem that dayah memang belum lagi bersedia kalau abah nak carikan fine tapi cari berkualiti this if people are not are ada quality and I said pada abah it's not about social status it's not about macam kaya tak kaya ya it's about the dia nak kena match ah
jadi budak ini dengan dayah are two different people so cannot
then membina diri sendiri eh macam mana
ah lepas itu baru boleh fikir macam mana nak bina
tak boleh zina cakap ah ya ya okay I will look at it lah abang ya
dia cakap abang lah okay
he ya of course then he cause he come down like first he I said oh I got to know I started off the conversation with him I got to know uh semalam that err you you are ashraf then I was thinking okay how is it macam mana dia akan menerima ini ah cara eh
zina selama ini tak kenalkan aku like
nama pun tak tahu semalam baru dapat tahu nama I don't know lah but then lepas itu dia tanya err abang your name is salim is it ah yes
ya he was very comfortable and just calling me abang ah like if macam dia satay ada banyak ya then abang also can bring back the
so I thought err ya that's why it was easy lah macam abang pun cakap and because like I said
I told ashraf that I'm appreciative yang dia terus terang dia
ada apa ada wawasan lah ah
lepas itu abang pun cakap ah yang kalau ashraf datang habis tak tak apa tak clear ah habis suka nak kelentong-kelentong ini
encik pun tak nak tak nak cakap cakap dengan ashraf ini ah
okay lah I thought macam the
macam mana it went through was good lah ya
ah azlina azlina need to macam grow up lah on this
because I I'm trying to point to our since you admire so much this person and you're macam like then at least pick up the good attributes that he has lah correct or not if you cannot pick it up from me then pick it up from someone else whatever just pick it up I said I said just pick it up what ashraf has did did you see or not how ashraf did it
so simple right he just be straightforward be upfront tak ada nak sembunyi-sembunyi
kan daddy cerita senang then I say isn't it simple so that macam orang tak curiga orang tak terfikir-fikir orang tak keliru
ah you just have to be upfront jer kan senang and ya lah ya ya you need to wake up okay you need to wake up and see how to address this
aku cakap dengan dia yang easy-going dengan being firm
during the discussion dengan ashraf I was saying zina
didn't have any plan you know what to do with her life I have been the one to guide her in what to study mm ah ashraf dengar jer lah what he want to say he just mm mm
mm but whatever it is he is already macam he never macam like show the reaction of macam you know or he didn't show it lah of being tak nak tak nak apa oh like shock or what I think he knows ah what he's getting into with zina
ya lah I agree of course that's why I said they both tersendiri nak kena grow and learn on what they need to grow about and then grow together only after the growing indeed tersendiri
if if kalau izat buat gitu then I will tell him off lah eh kau kenal dia ke tak kan kalau kita tak buat ini kita tak tahu apa so we have to be we have to take this step kita kena uh apa kita mesti
ambil uh
kegiatan begini ah tak boleh macam ah
tak boleh macam apa ambil scenario jer
I faham
no lah dia tak boleh terus macam lepaskan tangan no
I was two zero abah open this topic about dayah then I was asking zina zina what have you been talking to dayah lah about dayah's like err relationship or a'ah zina cakap no we don't talk each other huh
sekarang dua-dua sudah try kan
dua-dua sudah try
tak boleh kan so you tell me apa nak kena buat sekarang
nak buat apa sekarang then dia sudah ah ya try again lah try no
sudah try sudah sekarang kan tak boleh kan so nak kena buat apa
do what you want me to tell you the answer takkan lah I have to give you the answer
why you must have the jawapan for me
I want to hear from your own mulut
and then dia cakap ya then kita nak kena ask someone to help ah then siapa this someone to help
kenapa it has to be me to ask you to
you know abang salim kita ada problem
okay just kind of macam jumpa
see things eye to eye tak boleh macam bersefahaman
and we just cannot talk about personal things let's say ya do you know why zina kalau if this were the reverse that let's say you and zina you and dayah
macam mana pun that has happen ah izat would still come and apologize to me
then you did zina was saying macam like ya but you guys don't talk about personal no I talk about personal things to izat
macam like life lah about children about
apa marriage like that that
lah macam ya lah macam like how how he uh apa decided to get married with with salimah then ya we have ya before even during during apa
during ah our apa being after being married also we still talk about macam certain thing we don't talk about jobs we are not macam pen pals is not like macam like the way I would talk to faris for example but
macam at least macam things things about personal things I still can talk to him macam I can easily talk to him macam eh izat kau tengok macam ah macam dayah is like I I can have the conversation with izat you know ya I can but macam
dayah and zina will not be able to talk about anything personal they will just talk about things that macam
no lah not really enstranged like even after this one I I have macam move on and forgive him already like whatever he needs to work on it he knows that he needs to work on it it's it's a long working it's a long working process for him at the very least now he can learn to apologise dulu lagi tak boleh apologise pun dia punya ego is so big
I know that if I meet him the next time he will actually still come and say apologize to me just to macam make sure that we are in good terms because at least he wants to proactively want us to be in good terms hidayah and zina is different they are just happy with being ignored
dayah zina sudah give up with this thing where she would just be happy with ignoring hidiyah
that's how bad it is ah so at least me and izat kalau kita disagree but we will want to still talk about it we won't like ignore it like izat macam has a very strong point he will still want to talk about it like this thing that macam he feels very strongly that I'm going to be very aggressive he will still talk about it what he will not macam um tak nak berbual dengan si salim no he still at least wants to talk about it so at least that's healthy enough
how he macam best character he needs to learn to work it out
kita semua memang have your own areas of growth but
dayah and zina is like they just ignore the problem then I say zina especially now when you are about to get married what do you think would happen nanti bil zina sudah kahwin zina sudah pergi tinggal tempat lain lagi kan lagi kau orang lagi will be more separated
you and dayah ready have a problem bila kau orang tak sama rumah lagi what do you think
this passive aggressiveness tak boleh tak boleh ah
and not just macam like ah tak apa no it's not tak apa
ya I I did I did macam tell her lah that at the end of the day we are all family and I also did tell her that uh
you nak kena
fikir how
this is important this memang mustahak
you cannot just macam biarkan that this issue err to just continue as it is because it's not gonna be healthy
ah first you have to you setuju if you setuju
you want me to help okay then that's enough for your side I will ask hidayah tanya hidayah kalau hidayah nak then
jadi it's just that simple
both first of all the plan is get both of them to a room sit down talk about their trust issues that they have for each other the biggest problem masalah yang dia ada ini is trust issues hidayah doesn't trust her because hidayah feels that she is very incompetent still very childish and what what what what still haven't gone through life experience about what zina has trust issues because things dayah is no no it all dismiss I'm better than you ah so that's why lah trust issues you issue you don't trust each other's number one you don't trust each other in terms of feelings you don't trust each other about your thoughts ah so that is the the issue here then it will manifest to every other thing isn't it
tak boleh ah it's just not healthy and you cannot just
biarkan macam gitu jer
mama abah just listen so good thing was
mama abah willing to hear
mm kenapa
zina was uh no I uh zina was saying that she was um the reason why apa she went on to telling izat first because she felt more comfortable talking to izat
then she she sudah bingit lah bila kena rubbish then she walk off
she she kena already lah then she walk off
then say ya of recent years it has been the case ah that's that's the part I said ah rubbish then stop it since when then she already sudah kena then she walk off to toilet
because like ya she had to hear it lah macam like eh mana wah you are the
so going back to yang tadi kan we were talking about zina and dayah and I was asking zina who do you think you
jadi sebab dia kena tengok and understand that this is the situation
and zina sit down together then they can iron this out lah macam
they just don't see the point in macam making sure that they are
true lah dia tak boleh macam just simply you know say that oh this is a one time deal mesti lah dia ingat
ya so obviously it takes steps lah it's not macam I one time can boleh boleh
ya so the correct so the third year aku move out err then I was uh staying dekat my aunty's punya place lah so what happens is uh I was there uh for actually aku duduk kat rumah dia kan for very long it's about
uh I they gave me hints lah ya they gave me hints towards the end of the so I I stayed dekat dia orang punya place for one and a half years ya one and a half years err my my bedroom was actually literally the hall the hall way err they had a sofa bed down there so I was sleeping there
and then uh that was the the time where aku just uh you know just tried to just tried to to survive lah you know but the good thing was that I was not out in the streets I was I was actually you know I had a I had a roof lah and then I was you know so that was a good thing lah
correct so that was that was err err you know err at the end of the three years then err aku early this this this year ah first of january actually
err sometimes okay terms sometimes tak okay lah so that means macam um kadang-kadang she will invite me back tau macam um you know to to her to the family home lah but uh sometimes we will have some discussion she she was kind of like try to open up a discussion and then you know we will have our little debate ya and then after
um she totally changed bukan change macam apa ah so she totally macam uh you know she she's more err she she literally like uh tries to bother about what I'm doing you know uh getting to know what I'm doing and that kind of stuff I don't know what happened in the time that I was not there tapi uh aku rasa she I don't know whether she realise lah that I think family is more important than you know having I mean making making everybody conform to a certain practice or whatever that kind of thing lah so I think the the the harmony is you know in in in having a family and all that so so I I would say that she she tolerates me lah now err but but the good thing is that in the last six to seven months eh we have not had a single argument I think she has learnt to accept
yes yes yes rimas rimas is the correct word yes yes I agree I agree
I I I I also feel the same way as you you know because last time ah whenever it I'm the same as you ah mesti kalau macam cakap kan mesti nak menang tau macam in an argument eh kalau mesti nak cakap mesti nak menang so I'm always macam energetically fight back tau ah passionate macam fight back tau but nowadays kan macam I I don't know ah kenapa it's just maybe maybe it's also because we we had gone through uh certain thing ya sort of like grown up you know being out there alone being by myself you know independent and all that
so uh kita macam tak tak uh apa tu there's no more energy to to ah to to expand to to argue tau macam at the most pun kalau even if we don't agree kan nanti the conversation will just die off like that rather than it turning into become a heated argument it will just die off you know and and that's honestly that's what I prefer lah you know it's just you know you just you just stop lah just you just don't don't don't speak lah but but it's something that I have always um like macam I I'm really thankful that um she's no longer you know the the the the person that she used to be because ya because err I I knew back then eh I knew for a fact that I could not live with her I definitely definitely could not stay in the same room with her
back then but then now I realise okay lah you know she's also ageing and she's also going old and all that I'm not sure whether is it because err dia pergi haji uh last year you know the previous year she she went for a pilgrimage you know and and she was very lucky it was just before COVID struck you know so she managed to go with my dad and then after that uh she came back and err I think I don't know lah maybe maybe the experience over there changed her or or you know it could be it could be the case that she realise some things when she's there you know
actually you are right you know I'm like you know Kinder Bueno tak yang the coklat Kinder Bueno okay okay I I tell you what's the relation eh Kinder Bueno dia punya chocolate it's hard on the outside but when you get to the inside it's actually really really soft
is it is it is that is that oh for me for me I can if if if it's some if it's an issue that's very close to my heart kan I will I will ah I will be very very uh macam adamant to to keep to my belief style ah so when when I and when I'm that kind eh you that no matter what you do right I will not change and I will not follow whatever you say I will just keep to my own ini but if you were to do the reverse if you were to do the reverse psychology type of thing uh I will I will melt I will melt and I will just give in tau
so I'm the type of person and and she knows this actually she knows this dia pernah bilang dia pernah cakap I think so yes yes it's a lot with ego it's a lot to do with ego I I think so but now it's a it's a better experience lah ya and then apa
I actually find them funny lah it's just like the way they walk lah aku tak boleh dok aku aku kalau tengok dia orang jalan macam gitu kan every time aku tengok like macam it's like eh it's like eh bro your one very big ah bro ya
yes I remember that conversation very very well I remember it vividly yes of course you were the one who got me to try out for punya apa tu uh yang yang yang ni apa we we we had we had a few we had a few conversations one was one was uh the the part when you call me over the phone and we talked a very very long time you remember that part ya that was the first time kan so you ask me to apply for punya apa tu uh opening kan yang yang ala air steward
ya err I told you about my eyesight and I also told you about uh I didn't know it at whether I'll make the cut and all that and then you you were like eh come lah just just follow me lah you know just just go you know together and that kind of stuff ya and then and then that was the first convo that I that I remember very vividly the second convo than we had was at dekat tak ingat tak dia dekat kita dekat northpoint kat yishun
will you remember we weren't outside we were sitting in an open area dekat northpoint dekat McDonald's and then kat luar and then we were talking about things like illuminati lah we were talking about all the stuff that you know you remember or not and I still remember that I still remember that convo I still remember all our convos bro no no no it's okay it's but I I I I will always remember so
you you you I I know for a fact that you you when I talk to you right um the way you the perspective that you give to me is a different perspective tau which which means okay macam let's say for example eh I you you I like just now I was telling you about you know how I was out and that kind of stuff and then and then you were you were telling me about how you understood that such people behave in a in a certain manner because of you know somethings and all that for me I wouldn't be able to understand tau kenapa dia macam gitu
well I I knew that being a pilot was what I want but I didn't know that I could also try out to become like say for example an air steward you know what I mean which is not really flying flying but it's still this the the the I mean you are in the you are in the industry and you are very near to where you want to be technically ya you know so err and and and it was honestly right my mind ah is always a one track thing so let's say for example kan aku cakap okay I told myself ah I I want to become a pilot but err I will only think about okay how do I become a pilot how do I do this how do I do that I I wouldn't think of okay maybe there is another way maybe I can become a air steward first then I can jump into you know into a fancy and that kind of thing lah so I I don't have that kind of err presence of mind ah to think that I should do this and then it would eventually lead me on to the thing I'd go the straight out
so so my my life in in this industry lah in this aviation industry started out with um with simulators so it started out in the in the confines of my own in my my room uh on the computer so my dad was the one that I credit for for giving me this passion lah because he wanted to become a pilot himself tapi dia punya eyesight err macam tak err how to say eh uh not hundred percent lah not not not not a six six lah vision lah so uh and at that time kan dia orang very strict kan kalau kau punya eyesight is not perfect eyesight then you you don't even get a chance dia lain ah ah tau yes correct correct
no as in as in there's other planes there's there's other aircraft out there there's so many actually actually you are right sebab tu eh they realise eh in err in err eventually they realise that having a six six vision is not a requirement you can ya they change they change in nineteen ninety eight
nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety nine I remember this very vividly because I still remember I was in secondary school and they the first organisation that made the change was which is the air force so dia orang uh they publicised in the newspaper the very first pilot titled pilot tau who was wearing glasses ya and they put his picture big big down there I remember man on that day I bought like three copies of the newspaper I cut out all the picture and I pasted it all over my room just just to motivate myself and say that look all is not lost because I started wearing glasses when I was primary four already ya ya so I was very I have always felt that it was an impossible dream to achieve
because because dah tak boleh apa because you dah pakai you dah pakai glasses then that's that's it lah you you no more already lah no more chance right so ah so that was what spurt on my motivation uh and and make the fire burn the fire was winning back again so after that when I was in uh so after I finished secondary school right I set my sights on the youth flying club so what I did was I join the youth flying club and I managed to pass the interview you know and and go through the the thing and I managed to err err start the flying course ah so that time uh they were offering for those people who were successful and being accepted in the course they let your parents uh fly in the aeroplane for free therefore one flight macam familiarisation flight ah so both my parents actually got the chance to to to try out lah dekat err kita pergi sana then after that apa tu they they brief us and then err they they brought my parents up and then just to show them how it's like to fly and all that lah this was a very long time ago sekarang dah takde lagi tau
sekarang ah sekarang is no more already no no more they they don't offer that kind of stuff already but last time they used to so what I did was I went through the course and when I went through the course it kind of cemented my my ambition uh even further because I felt you know ah bro the very first time I flew in the aeroplane it was during my familiarisation flight dekat youth flying club tau and this was when I was sixteen lah when I was up there it was such a different feeling
there's there's that's technically true but it's not flying lightning speed ya but when I landed when my when our plane landed and when I stepped off the plane I couldn't feel my feet lah bro I was just floating I was literally just still floating I was on cloud nine I was just I was just you know but that was the thing lah that was that was this that told me like okay you know I have to I have to make this somehow come true a dream and all that lah ya so I pursued it you know I I kept on pursuing it and I studied all that I could tapi aku I made a mistake
one of the mistakes was that I thought that I needed physics macam science ah science punya subject kan err I I thought that I needed science in order for me to be able to become a pilot
uh it was a mistake because I took the wrong course when I was in junior college last time ah I I'm I'm an arts person I was more of a arts person I should have taken an art subject because that's my stronger that my forte but I chose science because I thought I needed science to become a pilot but science wasn't exactly my uh my my my strong point I mean only the aerodynamic but my physics teacher was so uh puzzled because did cakap apa tau
uh eh I realised that you can do this topic very very well it was on aviation and aerodynamics ah but your other topics ah you rabak man you cannot make it why ah then I realise that but it was it was uh uh only way way way later lah then I realise that uh okay I I I actually
ya ya ya it was that bad I was literally aku tak boleh bergerak I was just I I and I still remember that day was my uh examination my english paper punya examination and err I couldn't I couldn't move I had to call my dad for help you know send me over then when he saw my condition he's like I'm bringing you to the hospital right now ah okay so what happens is this this this condition after I remove the appendix right
it recurred again ya it recurred again so uh that was another dent in my in my in my dreams lah basically ya so that was the reason why that time you know aku pergi ah punya air steward punya interview tu yang aku pass
err actually I pass the interview okay but because they they they saw the hernia condition I failed my medical that's why aku tak aku tak dapat uh jadi err air steward as well ya so in the end in the end I so you you see how how it all ties up lah how it all times ties back together
I I don't man I had to I had to use for the operation aku pakai ni aku pakai my medisave uh my my apa tu orang panggil
uh I offset from my medisave a bit and then I paid uh pakai insurance ah macam my medical insurance ah ya err for I was working my ass off man I was working three jobs at that point of time
apa working
ada ada sikit uh my mortgage kan every month is uh one point one K uh aku punya err they cut off aku punya uh eight hundred
so aku kena top up three hundred every month there is correct yes in the future lah aku aku aku I was thinking lah anyway that one is is is always an option I I'm keeping it as an option for me lah which is why I wanted a bigger place uh the other reason was because aku ada terlalu banyak barang-barang ah all my baggage my
eh I don't mind man I really don't mind kau tahu rumah aku kat mana tak dekat it's just beside admiralty jer also admiralty is at woodlands I mean the woodlands area kan and uh the it's only about macam five minutes
tak tak tak tak it's not it's uh it's it's just opposite the ya it's opposite the it's a residential punya punya place ah
yes I was there uh okay lah it was it was uh it was it was a good it was a good experience but the problem is um when you are overseas eh err your how do I put it eh you you're considered as an expat tau so expats they they are a bit particular it depends on the administration lah so that's the reason why um most of us kan kita belajar kat sana we gain the experience then we come back here and then we we try to uh apply with the local punya okay so right now right now err so okay so so right now what happens is this eh
so uh average lah it's just typical because for me and they consider they consider me as a entry level lah I'm not I'm not a macam senior captor and all that kind of thing so for me I'm more like the first officer or second officer type of uh about four K about there lah about about uh thereabouts okay so when COVID happened
yes yes yes yes that was in during reservist right I think yes I already signed kita dah sign contract kita dah sign dok we even we even err graduated kita semua dah celebrate seh we went out drinking I mean
ah tak tak tak tak tak I didn't go through the I was supposed to go through yes correct I was already together with the rest of the other so called batch mates
yes I know I know I know that was thing so I mean there's there's setbacks lah along the way there's you know there's ujian there's setbacks there's uh
ya I know right macam nasib kentang kan macam there's always something there to to you know but it's okay ya ya I know know I've heard of it before lah this phrase I know I know
tapi I mean I I've always thought that there is a silver lining lah you know in in every ya so aku I I'm I'm I'm still in it you know I'm still in it and I'm still waiting you know ya yes yes correct I'm still waiting so I'm hoping that when this COVID thing is over you know and everything you know go slowly goes back to uh goes back on track and all that right uh I I'm pretty sure lah one day lah one day I uh you know I I I I have a deep faith for for this for this thing so one day I will I'll you know I'll be I'll be able to to do it lah
eh it's a different skill set lah sia it's a yes yes correct I know I know I just imagine myself uh being on the drone so when I see it I was like oh okay ya lah but but by by I mean it's it's the best that I can do uh uh that's relatable and that's uh you know but I think uh they they have already announced macam plans lah you know
uh they want to push us to become uh flying instructors so ya so so I think it's just a matter of time where when this thing you know dies down and everything is uh back to normal again right uh I think you know hopefully lah hopefully I won't be too old and my age becomes a factor and I'm like shit now I'm to old aku tak boleh ah dok flight tak boleh
yes yes actually you are right you are right I I agree tapi dia dia punya orang he's not a war err what you call it eh he's not those ya he's a very selfish businessman but he's not the type of war mongering you know guy that that
exactly you know he's very divisive lah dia punya talking eh dia punya words eh that he say uh selalu make people uh fight each other
ya but dia punya orang macam tak um dia punya words ah he's words are very unwise and also no wisdom lah I I find that he's very different from obama obama eh when he speaks eh dia punya cakap eh all his words eh um they are very substance tau they have a lot of substance
macam their their their thoughts lah
eh kau ada citizenship eh new zealand uh huh
ya bro that's why you need to bring the entertainment to you that means your home right will be your one stop entertainment okay eh but new zealand mahal ke eh tak mahal kan dia punya standard of living huh
ya but I but no aku rasa it's not that much of uh how do you put it eh macam I I don't know what the currency is like uh the standard of living and the cost of living over there over there but from what I'm seeing eh it seems that everybody is okay leh dia orang macam tak
but the house is not fully paid for macam mana
cannot travel maknanya dia orang
kalau okay let's say macam for example eh kalau nak pergi ah okay ah cannot means the custom cannot clear them
nak kena macam uh in in a advance ah inform them in advance kind of thing ah
asal eh
tapi if you will just the duit bunga kan dia orang panggil duit bunga eh but you you still accumulate apa
correct twenty four per cent dia orang ambil kan they call it apa ah
those abilities like macam
but for me right I've always wanted a superpower that can help others similar to yours macam you cakap you want to be superman atau pun nak jadi
oh bat sorry batman or iron man okay kau nak jadi batman or iron man I would also want a superpower yang
mm dia bukan dia bukan specifically target a superhero this is just a superpower
ah so for me oh ya teleporting eh didn't actually come across my mind until tadi sebut teleporting
any place of the world you tau macam harry potter
err magic spell I forgot lah apa magic spell ah
mm ah disapparate ah dia orang disapparating but they can only do that when they come of age ah
goblet of fire cedric diggory yang ada siapa tu yang handsome tu nama dia ah
the telepathy must be something that I can switch on and switch off like if I want to know what the other person is thinking or if if I want to communicate without talking or gestures to the other person I can like macam switch on and off
budak-budak kan
for me to macam tahu what are they thinking about why are they thinking about
I do not want macam to be burdened
ah boleh on and off ah gitu
the thing is on and off lah I think every superpower ada burdensome
telepathy ah eh sorry apa
it depends lah whether you have more time the thing is people I think people nak this
duit definitely okay
okay apa
superpower macam okay teachers are also have superpower that's what I believe ah
you know young to young okay to you it might be nothing like helping a kid fall down or jaga or apa
budak nangis datang kasi peluk to orang besar kan macam nothing ah tapi
in the mata like macam orh
but what if naik lemak
like they dia orang tak nak
they just expect to be given eh dia ni rich apa so tak payah lah work hard so we just wait for him apa to durian runtuh
unlimited duit
it's something that you think of lah but I to me I think you know me as a person kan I'm not a person that wants unlimited duit
with unlimited duit
because ah okay the thing is something there macam
I cannot get your perspective is because money is the root of all evil that type okay but that apa I respect it's just that I'm just
since you were saying superpower apa ni your superpower of unlimited duit
if there's if that's if there is someone kan macam
ubat for COVID nineteen like the perfect ubat
for COVID nineteen like maybe I would want to study belajar macam mana like
like macam
free only untuk
K the thing is I think kan kalau untuk ubat-ubat canggih ni kan
probably free depending on what type of ubat
err like singapore singapore doesn't give macam a lot of things percuma free
I cannot you cannot please anyone everyone betul tak
apa you your superpower that you wanted was
unlimited duit
knowledge you pun macam meh uh macam gitu lah
dengan my personality lah
or do you want to give me a superhero that macam sama dengan I wonder woman
wonder woman is just macam too feminist ah

then besides that ada apa lagi eh um W hotel the sentosa one also I mean it's a little bit upscale but then you can use that hundred dollars voucher then all of us can use together right so okay daripada kranji
eh it baru keluar ah
tu lah
eh kalau snow city I can ask any of my ex-colleagues what then can go in for free
ya nanti lah next time we go over to your house I will ask mama what she wants to do but not this two weeks this two weeks like crazy gila
not son of a peach punya
err block one two eight is near to the swimming pool behind the hill ya so masa I kecil-kecil there will always be like sounds of dogs howling at night
then there will also be macam ada bau tak sedap ah but okay my family tak kena sangat ah but our neighbour pernah
nak dengar ghost story
so my neighbour I think tingkat dua we stay at the fourth floor so at night I think pukul sepuluh ke apa there was somebody who came over to their house macam you know the makcik-makcik jual keropok err they went at ten o’clock why do you open the door to a person who selling things right but my neighbour go and open ah so it it was a makcik selling cake tunjuk the cake all that so macam my neighbour kasihan then my neighbour pun beli lah the cake
so the makcik dah go off I think the next day they open up the cake there was a batu nisan inside
I think mama got tell a little bit of this story before then she like tersipu-sipu
K wait let me tell you the story of my parents punya renovation so they just got the key on deepavali like after like one month of extension then that one also like a little bit of a merepek ah cause the previous tenant they don't want to give the key to the letter box then my parents have to like repeatedly ask for it sebab dorang dah change dorang punya address
abeh entah lah like very niao ah so after that eventually they wanted to give the key on fifteen of november deepavali is fourteen but their agreement is only until fourteen of november so obviously my parents not happy it's just one day but then that weekend is a weekend yang they wanted to clean up the house cause sixteen november they will start the renovation already
so err eventually on fourteen november they got the key then um we went to the house the next day taufik pun pergi the house used to house twenty cats in the master bedroom
it was super smelly then the toilet was also super smelly we wash the master bedroom a few times everytime cuci jer keluar like black black black it's a few times you know then we went to pet store to beli the odour eliminator ah spray around a few times I think err we went on sunday last spray for the things then err I went again on monday
the next day ah the next day bau masih tak hilang ah cause twenty cats seh so spray spray spray lagi still tak hilang abeh bila I balik I was like having like a huge headache then err eventually I call err macam professional cleaning service
like they really will use an ozone generator to produce ozone to shock the smell and then they will they use a chemical atomiser juga so the chemical they break it down into like super super small molecule so that it can go into the porous surfaces ah so yesterday the person came the person it's a malay guy then the masuk the nak buat dia eh
tanya eh ni ada berapa kucing ni seh lepas tu I cakap dengan dia lah ada ada twenty cats dia macam wah teruk seh but he was like telling us that err okay ah the smell can be removed so he did all the things and then as he was doing it suddenly he went to one of the switch so dia pergi dekat switch then he call us lah say eh I think this house ada pijat punya infestation juga
because apparently on top of the switch ada colour black black black which is actually an indication of tahi pijat ah so he was like hopefully all the pijat bila orang tu angkat dah bawa sekali ah the all the bed bugs semua but we don't know whether inside the switch plug itself there will be pijat or not so yes but yesterday my mum pergi dah tak ada the smell sangat so I guess it worked but
ya err the pijat is at the switch so the electrician also came over yesterday was thursday wednesday the electrician came over on wednesday to to to ask what to change ah so we are changing the all the switches also just to be safer ya
they when they went tak ada the smell sangat and then macam um I think they hide the cats or they spray something on top but ada lah macam dua tiga ekor kucing kat the living room so macam we thought it was only two or three cats right so okay lah but end up the cause they went again macam
after they got the keys then the people ask for extension kan so during that period of time they ask whether can go over to the house to like do measurements for the renovation so initially they didn't allow lah dorang tak kasi then dah jadi my parents house apa so my parents pergi tu yang they were shocked
to see like twenty cats there oi kalau I think if my parents tahu pun they wouldn't have the house lah but no momok so it's okay
kencing kucing tak apa lah jangan kencing hantu ke apa ke
you cari you cari dekat which what site
have you tried yang those the punya job fairs pun tak ada
and as in mendaki sense what mendaki sense pun dorang will go to like some companies
aduh entah lah
or not really I mean tak ada bonus ah and all that apa ya as long as still something ah like my dad got a job my dad kan masa tu kena retire he got a job pun tu tak dapat bonus ke apa so that one is that only contract for one year ya
oh that time my brother my brother is still stuck in qatar right he had to fly back the he had to fly the plane to singapore so he manage to see his family kat airport for like one minute to lambai-lambai only
ya but um he also kena so even though they stay at crowne plaza I think all the pilots the flight attendants semua kena stay at crowne plaza so ya lah they only like macam see each other bila my brother keluar dari the sky train then my sister-in-law and the ya and his uh daughter cuma lambai
but tak boleh jumpa what is in different room so what my sister-in-law did was she my my brother dah lama tak makan makanan melayu right so
he requested for nasi lemak on the first for the breakfast then for lunch he asked for apa benda tu nasi ambeng or is it laksa one of it lah then malam he asked for bandung
missing all the local food simon to either macam like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
err they have malaysian restaurant there but then it's still macam makanan the variety is not as much lah ya
what oh mama high class you tak tahu ke
ya but mama high class lah that time ah she was watching her japan show eh at at your house lah then she texted me err nura masa tu kita ada stay dekat hotel tokyo one one of the atas hotel lah then I say no we didn't stay at the atas hotel we stayed at another like the same branch but the cheaper version then she was like wah situ ada makanan halal
abeh I said but we also eat makanan halal apa
actually if apa right if you just go with your parents type or my parents we could have stayed in Airbnb ah then can cook and all that
but the thing is mama is not very macam open to try food ya it's like macam she said like macam okay for example like when she went vulcans right I ask her so did you eat like vulcan food then she said actually not really lah we just eat like indian food all this thing then I ask mama like what's the point kan you're supposed to go like if you go to greece you're supposed to eat greek food you know but then you just go there you end up eating tandoori chicken which you can also eat in singapore
ah itu ramen tu
oh kita orang tak bawa pergi ah sashimi sushi restaurant that time we ate tempura ya ramen miso but not sushi she say she oh tak makan seaweed kan so tak bawa ah but all the rest dorang makan banyak obese apa
no idea ya like even the um balik punya flight she was like she said she eat a lot finish up the food all
I agree eh tapi kan nasi lemak I still prefer the silk air punya have you tried ah
oh my god the silk air punya is so nice ya oh I think out of all the err nasi lemak okay ah not counting like parents masak semua kan silk air nasi lemak is like up there ya but you cannot choose what so depends on your luck whether you will get the silk air with nasi lemak or not
like people say malaysia punya nasi lemak sedap kan I think silk air one that one is sedap
so I was telling taufik like maldives kan ada banyak island kan like can you open up one island just for singaporeans untuk okay what
I think ni kena write in to maldives nya government kan
tak boleh eh
ya lah for as long as he stay there I'm going to like betul-betul tekan
flying some of his friends have been retrenched like err he's flying A three fifty so a three fifty ada banyak flights so during the COVID period he has been to canada he was in new york he was in seattle he was in singapore he was in melbourne err where again
abeh the later later one banyak like holiday people ya but qatar dia punya border control is still strict not like macam
and if they come direct they will have to take the COVID test so some of them they go to first they stay there for fourteen days so to lepaskan the requirement of the singapore government ah lepas tu baru they fly to singapore expert
okay lah not expert but ya that's what they did I mean I was reading the there's this facebook group called the indians in singapore ah like the you know I will read the bangladeshi community in singapore then I read the malaysia singapore malaysians border crosser so recently I venture the indians in singapore so it's like malaysian punya banyak like jiwang-jiwang
or rindu family cakap dua minggu jer sekarang dah lapan bulan that kind of thing then I would say the indians in singapore banyak oh where is the class for this err ataupun rented room and talk about how to get to singapore if cannot be direct that kind of thing so ya I find out that they go through
our own life walaupun macam tak banyak benda going on but it's still like a lot of things happening
eh but my parents punya company so far quite good
tapi kan they tak hack the flooring for the they tak hack flooring semua ah they hack the skirting pastu they ah oh the service yard kan kita punya ada the that door the windows ah that one can hack they hack it out
oh ya macam face the apa the main road ke
but actually five year at ubi ones are not bad macam like my house kalau dah five year and a lot of people kan jual the the house if they take care of their houses actually it's not bad it's if you get the previous owner yang teruk tu yang ya ya you have a lot of things to do but I'm sure like if if we sell your house you will buy right
the five year one ah is one that you can consider cuma maybe you have to do the toilet ah
no it's homogeneous tiles but somehow when we went that time they were the only company to have this kind of tiles yang macam like a little bit kasar-kasar
ya true ours actually our renovation company is very good cuma sekarang dah tak ada lagi I don't know where they go
entah lah like competition
ya ours macam the my sister punya is like newer tapi dorang punya barang macam lagi cepat pecah ours kalau you tengok the door kan yang dia punya handle is quite solid but my sister punya macam kena picit banyak baru dia buka
kan abeh dia punya tempat masak the hood dah jatuh-jatuh
ya so if you want to buy buy techno jangan beli bosch
ah ya ya kena macam ada talk forum
then after a few years you kena tukar kan ya ours is granite but now got a lot of new new types of counter top my parents is using this thing called vulcan I also just first time I heard of it masa kita orang pergi that's why it's like um it's
um it's a little bit more atas than quartz and it can go up to the wall also so the dia punya tu macam fulfilling macam very atas kitchen
okay lah I why they didn't choose quartz that time oh cause kita orang pemalas they say that granite can withhold heat better than quartz jadi sebab kita nanti take the pot terus letak on the kitchen counter
taufik and I are the pemalas kind
granite the good thing is ya lah if it can withstand heat all that but the porous I think after awhile it will become porous pastu um tak banyak choices as compared to quartz
they say after a few years you kena buat sealing dia lah but kita orang tak pernah buat abeh nampak macam still okay apa takyah lah malas ya
oh okay dekat sini ada mister but I don't know whether they will have the washi tape ke tidak
okay lah okay lah I think some of the stuff not expensive ah but gold colour you better better have to go to JCube dah lama seh tak pergi jcube if I go there I will only go to JEM tomorrow jcube a bit out of the way ah
dorang nak tutup the temporary interchange to pindah to another temporary interchange kan did you read
it will be a temporary interchange again dah ten years eh
I work oh wait before I start working or is still the old one pastu I work the pindah to the temporary interchange and then I dah quit work dah three years with nparks baru pindah to another temporary and then last I read another ten years baru siap
so I cakap hillion dah siap dan yishun punya dah siap and then ah yes correct I think woodlands punya pun will be done before the jurong one will be done who the ah
ada masa the fifty was it ah fifty they say that by the year twenty twenty err apa they will move the science centre then science centre masih kat tempat lama aduh
entah lah ya I mean I would prefer at jurong lah cause you got more food choices I mean it's not like I'm working there still but the lakeside apparently it's supposed to be macam dekat dengan water feature entah lah but oh they said after that err they say that in the twenty twenties they will start breaking the ground err ya
abeh before COVID kenapa tak nak start
apa jer aduh well that's jurong for you tapi jurong punya rumah mahal
that's why after the news came out then the price went up and then news kata that they will no longer do the the price went down again then now might be up again so the price went up again so it all depends whether the is ada ke tidak
kalau you beli rumah nak beli kat mana
no it's just too expensive actually kan taufik and I were like looking to upgrade ke tidak tau cause like we were thinking lah that there was a period of time where mama say that she wants to come here stay over lah but we don't have any extra room what so we were thinking right should we upgrade to four room I mean I don't know whether you notice but we change our fan
we we were thinking of that but the thing is tapi sebab entah err like that lah slowly lah ya then apanya
we like the house punya location you know bawah there's a direct bus to town then you look over you can see like some greenery tak you don't see like into neighbour punya rumah so nak cari like really our criteria susah
like our neighbours are also okay pastu we have like area kat rumah to plant our garden
the area is in front of our house not in front of their house so takpe lah dorang pun dapat menikmati all the pemandangan-pemandangan plants yang taufik bawa balik
tak lah dia pun tengok agaknya dia tengok our area quite nice jadi dia takyah tambah dia tengok alah tak ada pokok besar lah jadi dia letak satu pokok besar dekat situ
ya holidays during off peak period it's cheaper the places that I went I want to go to pun tak crowded then ya then cheap and the tak crowded is the most important criteria
oh ya sekarang parents semua ada whatsapp chat right
pecah-pecah but we don't mind lah cause we know that you can always put back what but those she's always whenever she go to a new place she will become very pemalu kepala tunduk tak nak tengok orang macam macam like perempuan apa melayu terakhir eh
so that's why bawa dia lah pergi wash hands semua pastu keluar dia nampak lego jer terus macam hundred and eighty degrees turn ah like oo what's this pastu ambil then usually for all these kids they will run with my lego they will play with mine because mine is construction set so that it's relatable to them but if they see taufik punya dorang tak faham
because star wars kan so all the err apa all the vehicles they they don't understand this but my niece she just take seh and then one of the transformer cup ah you cannot see that it can be open but she knows that you can open it up then she said oh what's inside then she actually open up
and macam take out all the mini fixed ah aduh and ya she's also the first one to take thanos we have a thanos mini fix then she take thanos and she was so excited
she is she is two years old pastu dah dah dah do a lot of things lah then start riding a bicycle oh dah can understand a lot ah oh she can baca ayat kursi also
ya kalau dekat schools nak deal with the parents pastu to them they will think that it's okay but it it's actually like not okay for other kids you know and then they will learn from each other wah macam mana seh mm ya lah that one is also like my last priority
what's that ya for the seven years I dah tak boleh tahan ah at least this one it's a bit different
better to do different different things then my brain pun tak mendak sangat
yes correct dah hafal sangat
I tak pernah buat tuition like
oh dear actually why they why madrasah tak ambil like the err trained teachers ah
entah lah I'm not too sure
and my sis nak hantar my niece masuk madrasah tau
ah I tak tahu so next year my niece three years old then dia nak hantar pergi those macam ah hafal quran punya classes all that
mm so don't know lah cause I think my my sis just that she's working in a school ya now also I think she see the school environment she get like a bit scared so dia kata takpe lah dia nak hantar the my niece pergi masuk madrasah so let's see how it goes anyway baru two years old seh
ya asalkan you ada education you know you get your your cert this that you can use to find a job that's good enough but these people they really macam plan out everything for their children
I don't know what kind of parent I will be I but I think taufik will be very hands on he will bring the kid to the garden make the kid touch all the plants ya make the kid apa bau all the plants also ya I can imagine that
kenapa tak botanist seh
eh dulu I kecil-kecil kan I don't know whether I got tell you before I wanted to be a farmer
oh I I really wanted to jaga my own kambing-kambing like like want to be self-sustainable gitu like have my kambing-kambing oh sheep sheep so I can like err jual dia punya wool then um like kat new zealand then kat switzerland ke then like macam ada a small muslim community there so I boleh buatkan korban lah dekat their
err what do you think boleh
is it wah just now also I sibeh sleepy sia I don't know why tapi macam I think cause the the err shopping mall was very noisy so macam tak boleh tak boleh concentrate ah so like like everything too noisy then kita pun nak dengar cikgu pun tak boleh then we have to lean remember we were like leaning in to try and hear her like and it was like
ya you all intended to macam invite orang lain or no just the two of you
oh dia datang pukul berapa
then you balik rumah makan eh
mm I like the the chicken cutlet noodles and the chicken cutlet apa tu curry rice
ya it's like just the chicken cutlet so juicy reminds me of that time when I went to punya apa tu dia punya Cheers store kan then lepas tu tak ada tempat makanan halal so I just went to the Cheers store beli dia punya microwave food then err the microwave food I I bought this japanese curry katsu rice
set and then it was honestly okay just that the the curry err the the chicken was like very small and it was I think because microwave kan so it was macam a bit soggy already ya so it wasn't crispy so I'm now I'm thinking about crispy chicken now ya
oh this morning I was actually quite happy cause err I woke up at what time eh like around ten o'clock ya then I was a bit hungry so tapi like err there wasn't enough breakfast for me leftover from my family so I asked my helper to help me cook
nuggets and french fries ya so while she was cooking right then haziq called me ya then then ya haziq called me so I was super super happy because like macam dah lama tak dengar dia punya suara ya so I so I was super happy so the moment I answered the call right
ya cause he wanted to take his laptop hashtag priorities ya then err ya so he he wasn't supposed to walk lah technically but like he just waited for dia punya nurse to close the door then he secretly go and walk to his bag to take the laptop ya then err he was really happy I think he sang like I think like almost ten songs seh
then like he sing kan sampai nurse kat luar semua sampai I think like around like almost the entire ward boleh dengar dia nyanyi ya so like but then the nurses were very happy lah cause dorang pun tengok apa tu dia dah how many days tak macam macam tak sihat so sekarang dia tengah happy dia tengah sihat so dorang pun happy ah
so dorang pun macam tengah motivating him like wah wah today sing a lot ah just sing some more lah okay don't need to wait for tomorrow just sing more now ya so like
alhamdulillah boleh gembira sikit ya my heart is like tenang sikit ya so that was my morning then after that like while he was talking to me his mum suddenly came in like she never in knock apparently ya so mak dia datang pastu dia kena hang up lah so pasal dia tak nak tak nak kena kena tangkap ke apa kan so then err
err then after that he still texted me lah like oh now today like a lot dia nya dia punya sedara datang ya nak nak uh nak visit nak tengok ya so he just like uh kena layan dorang ya then just now right before I met you he was telling me that like dia nak watch netflix on his laptop tapi bapa dia tengah pakai so he was complaining then I'm like never mind lah your bapa tengah
tengah doing work kan then was like ya doing work but ya lah it's okay I'll just use ah then his sister was also using his ipad ya so he was using and his sister was using the ipad lah then he also cannot use to watch netflix so now he's watching TikTok
orang tengah sedih kena makan comfort food then after that gain weight after that gemuk after that uh regret
semalam ya I went out to go to the hospital tapi I tak dapat jumpa haziq lah cause err dia tengah rehat so I just duduk kat bawah jer ya what about you
belajar makan eh makan apa kat situ
no I always go to the choa chu kang one cause I gym kat choa chu kang ya so sometimes after work I go to choa chu kang to gym but there's always a long queue ya so I will join the queue err I will join is an electronic queue lah so I will go there scan the code then err I will join the queue then after that err they will they will text you when it's your turn
gym box ya the gym box punya queue management system is like that
but err in like after twelve then after that I wanted to go gym ah then cause my gym dia punya bawah ada this new burger king then cause our area you know there isn't a burger king nearby so I always never I'm like burger king deprived you know me and my fast food oh shit yesterday I eat burger king today I eat nuggets oh damn
right because our house area tak ada burger king dah lama then this is the newest one
ya so I think next time like I would still recommend the the apa tu the mozzarella cheese burger to other people tapi kalau if I were to go back to burger king I'll end up ordering the swiss the mushroom swiss instead lah
then I park at this super far away punya car park cause dia punya parking fees very cheap it's like for one hour is like one dollar and eight cents
that is super cheap like that's the cheapest already normal price err all the other parking lots are like double the price is exactly double the price macam two dollars sixty cents uh sixteen cents ah ya ya but my worry cause I never went there before kan so
but when I went there I takut like because it's quite ulu
dorang cakap ada shuttle bus ah tapi kalau because I'm gonna go there at night so I takut like
uh kalau bilang nanti bila malam nanti nak nak balik kan nanti ada benda
right smack in front of the only lift there ya so the moment like kalau apa-apa ternampak cabut ya ya then like I think cause it was so ulu so when I waited a I parked my car kan then after that I waited for the shuttle bus kat bawah
ada like dua budak lelaki budak melayu ni tengah tengok jer probably wondering like what the hell am I doing there cause I think cause I was like uh macam wearing office clothes ish ish lah I was wearing with jeans ah the top macam uh like office punya punya baju lah
ya then after that dorang tengok jer apa budak ni tengah buat kat sini ulu ulu punya tempat
ya so I tapi tak kesah lah so like the shuttle bus quite reliable honestly speaking ya so when I took the shuttle bus then I drop off at where I was supposed to then I went to the makan place the kaki makan tu ya and I ate my favourite err what's that called the lor mai kai ya
then I wanted to buy dia punya what's the one that we ate that time oh dia punya honey barbecue bao the one that was very big and fluffy right that time we ate ya but this time dorang tak ada semua dah habis so they only had like siew mai and lor mai kai and the typical nasi lemak so I didn't want to eat so heavy for the nasi lemak so I just got the cause the lor mai kai itself is already quite big right
and I want to try the there's noodles also so like I reach there around six O five ya then err when I go there then I wanted to buy the noodles cause that time we didn't get to try the noodles kan so dorang cakap uh noodles the person who cook the noodles uh only available sampai pukul enam then I'm like but it's six O five
so I missed it by five minutes ya it was so sad but it's okay lah uh inshallah next time ada rezeki boleh dah makan
makan noodles dia there was this err it's a bit like ban mian ya it's it looks a bit like ban mian but like I think got like hot dog and egg and fish I think ya ya ya ya so it's like you know on like a cold rainy day that's the kind ya you just really want to makan ya like you just craving kan
ya so I just like I wanted that was the they say like all the noodles like the the cook dah dah balik rumah lah so I just like okay tak ada rezeki then ya then err ya then I ate there then err the person I ask the person whether can I stay there for a longer period cause by right dorang tutup uh pukul tujuh
eh pukul tujuh eh pukul tujuh ke pukul lapan ya something like that ya but then I wanted to stay sampai kul sembilan ah tapi dorang cakap dorang tutup sampai pukul tujuh pukul lapan gitu tapi uh they allow me to sit dekat luar dia punya outdoor seating so it's not really outdoor lah it's still within the building it's just that it's outside the shop
ya macam in a way communal area lah tapi ada meja so okay lah so I makan there I duduk there sampai pukul sembilan gitu then after that I just went home ya I went back to the shuttle bus ya wah ya the shuttle bus was so hard to find like err cause it was a loop so I wanted to go to the other end of the loop ya but then ya it was so hard to find and thankfully
ya but alhamdulillah ya lah okay lah tak nampak apa-apa then I just balik rumah jer lah
ya I think so we still have like macam forty minutes to go
this is the kind of weather that you just want to hide under the selimut then after that you just sleep ya sia it's like so windy I hope I hope when we play the badminton later it won't be too windy ya but I think even if it's windy I think I will still be fun lah
ya ya tapi I saw kat sebelah dorang ada roller the want to roll the floor err when it's wet ya so ya it's not effective I must I must say that first as in how to say it's not very effective but it helps with the drying ah pasal it like last time when I tengah main netball kan I always use that roller to spread out the rain
actually no I wanted to teleport so I can go all over the world and like you know lah I like to travel the world kan ya so like if I teleport I don't even need to go and flights I don't need to pay for flights and technically I don't even need to apa tu
err stay in hotels also cause like I just teleport home tidur one night then the next day teleport to greece again or something like that ya so okay lah ya okay I need to aim to be like you
ya I I saw a few videos on it lah during during circuit breaker cause I mean during circuit breaker tak ada apa-apa nak buat kan ya so I just duduk rumah tengok video like in a way very sensitive content just tengok jer ya so I always get that then like like honestly right when I hear that it makes me happy but at the same time sad also
to be called a smart malay I'm just to me I'm just right I'm just trying my best that's all to survive in this singaporean society and I think to you whether you are malay or chinese or indian ya like so the fact like when when people tell me oh you went from then go to wah smart ah then in my recent job interview pun dorang tanya oh I think your academic background is very good
ya so like those err from what I understand is more of like those people yang dorang nak lari dari rumah uh dorang punya mak bapa selalu tak ada kat rumah uh apa tu maybe maybe you might need financial assistance all that pun ya selalu gaduh kat rumah and all that gaduh dengan kawan gaduh dengan cikgu that kind ya so err that is what apa tu Mendaki is trying to do lah ya this was err last year
you have you affected them so much that they change their lives around ya so that's what I wanted to do lah so I want I wanted to do that so like when I went to the interview right they were the wah the interview was like what like dua jam siol ya so ya so like I was talking for so long ya err I mean cause they want I think in a way they really wanted to get to know dorang punya volunteers
ya just to make sure that like you know in terms of adab in terms of your akhlak semua uh boleh pass lah ya like macam there is no macam red flag ya so like because these are people like the people like the student that we will be dealing with is like those people yang betul betul need help ah ya so like if you teach them the wrong thing then macam err Mendaki has to answer in a way lah so I I understand where they are coming from
very english lah like not not queens english but like I concentrate more on english and my malay was terrible kan ya but then now I mean I am improving lah in a way in my malay err language exposure ya so like when I err my my question to them was like I am macam in a way
like will they want to even listen to my advice or will they even want to like they probably cannot relate to me lah like your just be like your problem is different apa kau kan anak-anak orang kaya that kind ya so that was what I was afraid of lah my intention was to help them tapi kalau orang tak nak apa tu uh they don't want me to help then
ya so like cause the the mentor always like I mean like always rushing to school rushing to work before that right ya so like he didn't realise that the kid was sleeping at his void deck and he didn't even tell him ya so wah I'm like wah if I were to be in that mentors shoes right what would I do you know like I cannot imagine myself doing that so macam to be honest in a way I just lost confidence ah like in what I am able to do
ya but recently some of my friends have been asking whether I want to join or not ya but I don't know still thinking about it right now my life macam still huru-hara so I need to let it get it settled first lah don't spread your eggs in two many basket ya too many things man
like it can be a controversial opinion tapi macam
mm ya and I feel like that like free education right will only help to a certain extent ya I think like underlying problems such as macam maybe social and familial situations ya so for example like those
those students like like let's say they have problems at home like in a way their parents are getting divorced ya then macam dorang tak boleh they cannot like how say is very they can overcome it definitely that is is not impossible but it's still very hard lah like you know like how they say equality versus what ah equity
bro aku frus ah bro
what happened did you watch the game last week the okay okay okay okay okay okay fine I watch the man U game and I also watch liverpool game aku punya bingit which man U game the one with crystal palace ah
K K K admittedly macam macam budak-budak ah macam main dengan boy look look at look at wilfried freaking zaha what he what he did to us and what he could have been for us but no thanks to
geram seh then then and then this whole freaking transfer window where we are talking about gareth bale and sergio aguero and and thiago
but oh look dia pun sign the only work
and he says he doesn't know and this guy says he has a bunker iPad bunker with a full football knowledge database pakai football manager semak
david moyes kat mana dia baru lawan arteta last week
eh but but honestly speaking I think liverpool gonna angkat again ah the korang punya the only thing you all needed was that was exactly that that guy in the middle who can keep things simple and can also do the spectacular thiago
from passing from right to left left to right cause you can break through the middle so that's how josie monaco dominates without the ball like the barcelona against inter milan punya game ah barcelona ah eh sorry um
I the chaos manager is is what clock came from his school he doesn't van gaal doesn't like instincts that's why he always takes people he always tell people take one one step of the ball control the ball then shoot you will berate anyone yang terus shoot the ball tau
ah basically he wants the bag for of the opponent to kelam kabut he lose the ball there
ya but klopp he he demands the intensity and that kelam kabut
oh sun sun sun sun sun sun sun ah whatever lah melayu swan melayu
bro I have not been playing in that long for a long time aku main best twenty one ah sekarang eh best twenty twenty
ah okay let let me correct that I play a simulation game okay macam FIFA championship manager you is numbers bro lain sia bro ayam itik
tak apa okay best is a ya lah kan
bro kau pakai iPhone eh
kau ada best twenty twenty
aku no no can't say that
eh kau tak perlu sia tu geram
baik kau cakap men sia bro
dia dorang boycott or something I really against raymond dominic eh
macam Google analytics jer ni
marketing punya
give them conquer ah macam
mm dorang kat
in other words they create a a barbary like you're sort of you're equal chamber ah macam self self confirmation self confirming buyers ah
hazard a guess benda ni dekat
oh boleh pilih-pilih ah

oh ya ya ya right right now starting starting ah aku memang suka baca ah but starting last week
baik sia it's a british show it's it's a good change from the american latino gangster thing ah
okay pasal aku aku
no no no how I do my safe entry basically kalau let's say somewhere which I go often eh tampines mall
I don't close I don't ever close that browser so the next time I come ah use that same old from maybe last week or something aku malas sia nak scan scan balik ya ya I breaking protocols here but ya that's how I do it
A level O level semua keluar a'ah okay
okay ah so boleh ah
but apa double tap terus masuk camera mode apa
code keluar the camera app ah
aku press camera app I point it at the code
a'ah so why double tap can just masuk the app then
tu ah I was thinking apa macam sial ah aku tengok is that a code jadi code to your address or
so what's the ayat
so the start of the ayat start at the bottom
I I see what you did that you got ayatul kursi on
give me a good few suggestions eh ah my dad told me there's this good place dekat somewhere near the mushroom park opposite mushroom park
ah it's not at mushroom park tau mushroom park is old chang kee punya run is it's a cafe run by old chang kee but it's apparently across err
I know it's across mushroom park atau across the stadium
anchorvale nya
a'ah it's cheap but you can't get anymore melayu then that ah eh
wait so it it's not a good name cause there's no place to lepak or it's not a good name cause there's no corner for you to lepak
it's like the conundrum you how do you confused a mat you ask him you know put in a round room and ask me to lepak one corner
oh the cross across the simpang ini kan ya correct correct correct
err this kind of thing you have to macam mak bapa ah then sometimes they will advise biasa ah macam orang tua they have their preferred um preferred kadi of choice macam they dorang have gone to more weddings that we have
then so they have attended more of the ceremony so sometimes they like the they prefer tak ah kadi ni lagi bagus kadi ni lagi dia macam lagi ah lembut cara dia berbual that kind of thing lah so so usually how it works is that once five months prior five month is it five months ya five months prior to your wedding err you go online then your date your wedding date will be available
when once your date your date is available on on the website then you err boleh book ah then when you go in when you go into the website you can there will be a list of kadi available then all the kadi then they also show like where the kadi lives I think or where they the area where they prefer to where is most comfortable for them lah basically ya
can yes no problem ya ya there's no problem with that basically the the way they they put it is that because some people prefer macam oh takut kadi err they wanted for morning morning wedding kan so dorangnya ceremony for the nikah pagi so dorang tak nak macam kadi takut jam so kalau katakan they wanted to have a eight
um ceremony kan then after that oh nine ceremony then katakan they scared oh if the kadi tinggal pasir ris then my ceremony is in jurong dorang takut kadi datang jam you know that kind of thing so sometimes people prefer if they don't have as a preferred err they don't have a preferred err kadi sometimes they prefer to choose someone that lives nearby ah so so that that's how some people choose that's why the the where the kadi punya tak
look at the kadi available
then after that ya you can you can just look at the list of kadi available you just choose ah say your wedding date is in in two months time then you go in and you see all the kadi who are available then you just screenshot then you ask both sides whether okay I choose this one you okay you okay okay both sides okay then after that dah then you can boleh masuk and book the once your date is available you can go and book lah
ya so what I did what I did previously was I went into website than I went to check out the kadi available
and then after that macam
ya cause I don't want to like miss out on the kadi that I want but eventually on that day itself my kadi was busy so I got the I got his back up ya
err for me is I I think I did it at one on the day that it was available ya ya I I err you can ask lina for it when it comes to this kind of things a bit macam tak sabar everything I I prefer to do everything early rather than than than late ya correct
is it kadi kadi I think there's only three or four
then everything else is naib kadi ya
ni wali punya thing
I don't think anybody does any kadi reviews last time of course lah ya
mmhmm ya you don't want to you don't want to macam yang draggy draggy until macam kasi trauma that kind of thing kan
mm sometimes they they they they they drag all the ceremony and everything like then like the thing is like if like I I understand cause kadang-kadang macam the orang yang datang tak semua islam
you know kan that's that's one thing that for me also cause macam my groomsmen I have about four who are non-muslim so like if you were to have a extended err nikah ceremony with all the dua and everything with all the ceramah everything and then it makes it uncomfortable for some of them lah
ya you need like sometimes you want a a good kadi but then sometimes you don't want someone who
I think I think the okay when it comes to kadi they you won't get in contact with them directly with the person that you choose directly until probably one week before
put yourself in their shoes lah macam dorang
setiap minggu ada nikah to do
they will message you and then he will they usually the kadi will will for what happened to me was he he created a group a WhatsApp group chat
why he did that was basically just to macam ingatkan err remind you to bawa your err bawa then documents that you need to bring lah basically and then um some time then err he will contact me or give you a he contacted me via WhatsApp lah he ask me whether I knew what to say and everything then for me I told him I um
I told him I wasn't he ask me whatever I was nervous and whether I know what to say lah then I say tak ah err banyak members dah kahwin then I used to be I I'm their their groomsman and everything so macam apa nak cakap and everything all I got it down lah
no need to worry but for some of my friends some kadi will give you a call the night before then ask you to practise on the phone
ya ke but like what I say when it when it happens to me I think I think you you remember I forgot that there was a reading part
they have to read that the the the script ah err post post nikah ya ya no stress also ya but when I read cause I'm I'm I I I I'm not very fluent in in err like when when you're supposed to talk in an extended malay or read an extended malay I I tend to fall back to baku ya I I cause we all we all grew up you know secondary school macam kau primary school your oral have to be baku kan ya exactly
okay so the initial the initial kadi that we chose um on that day he was unable one month before he said he was unable to come on that weekend because he was he had a family gathering family event so he said he asked his best friend or his his colleague lah basically to take over so that colleague was there was when that colleague contacted me two weeks before
ya I've not met that guy before lah basically ya ya the kadi before but basically then he just give me a call and then ya um but when it comes to your situation itself right once you book the kadi that you want and then set a date with
then turun ah turun err on whichever date that err you guys have agreed upon and during the interview itself then you can tell the kadi ah macam oh err tunang saya bapa bukan islam then dia tanya like things of like how what is what's err um lah what what you do you need to do what are the things that needs to be covered during the ceremony to make it legit lah basically ya
I wanted to get the kadi that I want cause that's one that my dad ask me to get right so
I didn't want to get that time slot lose out that time slot for that one kadi that I wanted so I went in and then went to fill up the whole form then after that macam
cause I wanted I want to to know what I need ready ya so macam on the day itself if you need to do then oh semua dah siap
um I would say a lot of people nikah on saturday
a lot of people actually nikah on saturday and then wedding on sunday as in the typical if you want to talk about the people who do separate err double weddings I mean now is different but but
when my friends all got married previously all a lot of them got married nikah on a saturday and then wedding on a sunday ya
nak kena faham I mean from their point of view is necessary lah for people to for couples to be macam err ready I mean all these is like err basic rumahtangga punya knowledge ah right for them to know about like some of my friends went and then they talk about how to manage your finance as a couple what
um civics you know like to for you to understand like oh if I do this what my in-laws think you know that kind of thing if I if I handle money this way what would my wife think that kind of thing lah ya it it it's it's it's more of that and then they have a lot of macam very open conversations lah but I find it a waste of time for me personally
is not with the is not you don't interview with your kadi ya you do with with err the the head kadi who is in charge of everyone so he will interview every single person
and the wakil from the bride
as in not not necessarily wakil lah as in just a representative for the girl side
so for me is I I brought mak ah
I mean like it will be better lah right like you don't need to be it doesn't need to be a guy cause I brought mak so ya
ya ya so that's the one where they will interview basically I guess the point of the interview is to see whether macam
whether it's a forced marriage you know that kind of thing ya so he went on to say like are you willing like is this out of willingness what's the purpose of you getting married you know the kind of thing ya err then he banyak soalan juga they will you're in there for about ten fifteen minutes I would say at least
you don't really you don't have a conversation with kadi until like two weeks before your wedding
the head of the guy who is in charge of all the kadi
that is after so so basically okay once you reach you have to do registration and everything kan submit your papers then they will give you a queue number then once your queue number is ready you go inside this room and then this room is where the the head of err the the ustaz is there lah he will question you some questions whether are you born muslim I think that's a that kind of things lah I think those those those are some of the questions that he asked and lepas tu
I think he asked mak some questions then ask lina some questions and then
once it's all that okay and then ya then you go out when you are leaving the room and there will be like two kakak there will be asking you macam awak awak kahwin kahwin kita ada marriage prep ni eh err apa for you to go and then you like oh and alamak ni saya bila lah then for me right what happened to me was like dorang cakap ni awak dengan tunang awak boleh sign up ni bagus tau macam very informative and everything lah they were saying all the like like they a give long speech about it I said I'm too busy ah so then after that then they will shut up
cause I got a few friends who went a lot a few or no no no you very long time ago ya I I thought it's quite recent also until my colleague she say aku dah kahwin lima belas tahun tak pernah pergi ah that's why I thought was compulsory I think is just a exactly so I I think right is all macam a propaganda kind of thing like semua kena pergi you know like kind of thing kena pergi like you know how how the the language malay the malay language is like that where they want you to like you should go they would use the word kena you know is like kau kena pergi
ah you know like like cause like typical err like pasar melayu they will like say eh kau kena pergi tau ni
but the in malay is both we will usually use the word kena anyway ya so I think that's how it it spiral out of control then make a lot people think is compulsory but the thing is it has never been compulsory because it's not part of of err islamic laws what for you to to go through a course
ya so I did I cause when when it when when it came to my marriage I told alina macam I want to cut out all a lot of the non compulsory things in in our marriage lah I mean to cut down all the cost lah basically like I was telling things things like like dulang it's not compulsory you know things like that then um a lot of the other things lah like red wedding cake lah the kompang lah all this kind of thing all not compulsory no didn't have wedding cake
semua orang duduk kan and semua orang boleh tengok macam oh dia tengah potong cake err
you know but if you have a typical wedding macam kita semua macam orang semua tengah ambil makan buffet kan dorang jalan ambil makan everything kan a lot of the times my friend potong cake orang kat belakang tak tahu then like for me is that okay for some of them it all depends like I said it all depends on the couple lah some couples
is a is a western is a western tradition ya so some people some people say oh I don't cut for everybody to say I cut for me and my wife for that special moment I get it macam okay aku faham but for some people they want to make sure that all the guest see you know macam if you are if you are the kind of person that you want to have a wedding cake and you want everyone to see cause your wedding cakes are not going to be cheap
ya cause they know I I am degil usually lah when it comes to malay weddings right a lot of the time more often than not the dia punya mak andam suka control
mak andam is the the the the bride's err makeup artist lah ya okay but when it comes to makeup artist is different leh like lina makeup artist makeup jalan mak andam is the kind who will stick with the bride the whole day that kind so a lot of the my colleagues at my my friend my wife err one of them pakai scarf so the whole day the mak andam there betulkan scarf dia then the other one err what's that called makeup then everything betulkan makeup dia everything kan so
so then the groom's side don't have pak andam err I don't know I think it's called pak andam ya they now now nowadays they have nowadays they they insist
some of them insist then because yes correct so um the the girl the they they rent the baju kan they rent the baju then they would they kain samping they ask pak andam it's all part of money making process lah
err a lot a lot of times twice I had I met with the same mak andam
cause people you know like oh ni mak andam aku bagus tau you know your makeup dia baik then they they the same cause it's all within the same clique of friends one then always the same mak andam cause they will try to macam
you understand where they're coming from in a sense of that macam aku aku need satu jam nak tukar outfit untuk err pengantin perempuan nak kena satu jam satu jam setengah tukar rambut dia nak buka nak tukar makeup dia tukar baju dia one and half hour so they always try to dig out as much time as possible so katakan all weddings eh
ya whole day so we so basically katakan lepas nikah you plan in your itinerary habis nikah pukul lapan setengah err let's say sebelas setengah your habis nikah sebelas setengah right but then you think is sebelas setengah habis err pukul dua belas tukar baju for the next half I can bet with you sebelas setengah nikah belum habis
ceremony nikah might be finished might finish at eleven thirty but the time gone macam nangis-nangis salam-salam salam-salam ambil gambar ambil gambar eh dah pukul dua belas
then like shit I need to go to the room then you will you really lose let's say you lose fifteen minutes here then you every every every other things right you will lose fifteen minutes fifteen minutes ya you want to walk to the room or you want to walk out with orang nak ambil gambar every take one picture one picture one picture you know the kind of thing right and then you no matter what every wedding there will be delays
so that's the thing macam semua semua tak pernah I went to any wedding where is macam on on the dot so it's it's impossible like there's no point of you macam oh eleven O five you come here like no point lah you want to
plus minus fifteen minutes is not bad lah you don't you don't macam because I've I've a friend who actually plan eleven O five kita turun bawah eleven ten must be down here eleven fifteen we move off then I'm like bro by the time we move off twelve o'clock
ya like you for the purpose for all those you must be a bit flexible with your timing that's one thing and then and on top of that you must know mak andam suka macam they know this cause they they do weddings is their is their living is their work right ya bread and butter they know how it works so they will always try to selit as much time as possible so for example
for me ah I scold my friends mak andam a lot of times already like like I met her I everytime I scold her because she I know what she's doing as she also know what I'm doing ah cause basically like say for my friend right
dia nikah kat masjid then lepas nikah ambil gambar ambil gambar ambil gambar
then after that they said okay we're going to change location to the they did kat simei yang makan kat sana lepas tu kat masjid dorang to move off they want to move off then after that err I'm supposed to move off at err twelve o'clock so
so got one and half hours but then now is twelve fifteen eh no no now is eleven err at that point of time when it happened it was eleven thirty ke eleven forty five around there
then after that she went err she she went to tell the groom's mum cause that the nikah kat masjid is the groom's side
the makan at simei is the girl is the bride side so he told the grooms she told the groom's mum kita nak kena jalan sekarang tau then the groom's mum err tapi pengantin belum makan tau
belum makan eh lepas nikah everything ambil gambar ambil gambar belum makan pengantin belum makan then she said err takpe lah nanti dorang tukar baju kat sana nanti ada makan juga pe
exactly right so I knew how he's going to be pissed so I told I told I told her I told her no no no no no no kita pengantin makan then I told my friends to go and siapkan the food
she went behind my back again she tell the mak the mak err pengantin both sides eh err tak payah makan eh kita makan kat sana jer eh she thinks she can the parents would override me but because I I knew them since I was young like the my friend's mum knew me since I was wearing shorts in secondary school the that kind of thing like we know each other for for fifteen years that kind already
ya then she she was like err err tak tahu awak tanya salam that kind of thing you know ya so she cause she she know how degil and how angry I can get err so she's like and she know that I I'm the whole itinerary is is run by me so then the mak andam cannot say anything lah she cause she want to turn back err she know what I'm gonna say already
forgo what is the rights of the bride and the groom ah right ah exactly kita dah plan dorang makan apa you want to tell them makan makan ala kadar okay you want to tell them don't eat you go ahead you go to hell ya so that at that point I I she sit at the at the pengantin table then she sitting down there
tak payah tak payah tak payah like I no lah awak diri awak diri jalan jalan jalan ya exactly no but some people are pushovers so she would win when people are like okay lah okay lah you know
now is eleven thirty eleven forty five we need to go eleven thirty dorang belum start makan tau that in her mind by the time dorang start makan by the time dah gini gini aku tak ada time nak betulkan rambut si dia ni that's how she's thinking yes but for me is like
jangan kau tak payah kesah kalau you if you need two hours you will get your two hours that's that's my point like if the bride and groom are supposed to walk in at two on that side what's the difference with two thirty
you know but you cannot be like one or one and half hours that flexible lah you cannot be that flexible but at the same time that's why you as the macam for me lah as the as the the brides err eh as the best best man I have to macam keep everything running lah ya
ya so those those are the things that for me macam important lah nak kena tahu macam
ya because sometimes like my photographers supposed to be err end one hour earlier but then cause he had one a two hour break in the middle he gi makan prata and everything I told him to go eat prata what ah cause as I say no we we keep we reach we reach the hotel will be late at that time
ya so it's like err suka hati dia nak makan lah he was kat sini ada makan apa eh you are like kau tanya aku kat fort canning mana aku tahu makan apa kau gi makan cari kedai prata
yes okay and on top of that like things like I say ah macam you have to also macam recce how much are they charging you for rental lah because the cost of rental could be a lot more than you making your own baju
ya she for me it's like I gave her like I told her mak andam makeup artist you handle you pay
I told her macam that is all on you
it's not a macam a combined expense like the makeup part is not a combined expense to me so I told her that one if you you find yourself you you going and recce yourself because I cannot tell you macam maybe some makeup artists oh this is hundred dollars that one is two hundred dollars but then the hundred dollar one
but but sometimes you don't know how how how good they are sekali they make you look like a nyonya you know that kind of thing you also don't know ya
mm ya but but like I say these kind of thing suruh dewi pergi Instagram go and stalk people lah
ah you can just search makeup artist or mak andam then you just search search search or you can even when you look for photographer and they will always tag all the people then you go and check oh wah her makeup very nice ah look very natural and you go see oh it's done by this person then you go click her then you go and message ask dewi to message her alina I think messaged like at least five to six people on on Instagram err for for quotations
ya not necessary mak andam would be worth it if you are planning to rent baju I would say
but at the same time sometimes they overcharged because they macam oh because it's err package dengan empat baju cause it's err bride and groom tukar dua kali you know that kind of thing so they got four four sets of baju
but then sometimes like I don't buy like I actually only need the baju kurung you know that kind of thing I don't need the second part second part I got my own err western baju for example kan then you don't need things like that ya
yes then they always have but the thing is sometimes it's it's smart to do it with them because they have all the connection like if you do it with their friend then you can you know like if you do the photographer with this guy with this mak andam then she will give you discounts ah that kind of thing lah ya they all have like their full package
it's up to you I would say okay so that's why okay that's why macam your
if you are planning to do a a photoshoot after are you going to tukar baju from are you going to change outfit or not change outfit that's one thing and if you are going to change outfit and are you going to reapply makeup not reapply makeup
I mean if you want to get just get for her parents and mak then that's it lah for the rest of us all we can can settle ourselves lah
just to put at the front so when during kau nya nikah orang duduk kat depan sana tapi lepas nikah
orang makan dah makan dorang boleh duduk they still have seats to sit around my thinking was after orang makan they can go to the park
at the same time you cannot expect people dah makan jalan ah is okay you also cannot expect dah makan jalan lah you know that kind of thing ah eh kau dah makan angkat pinggan mangkuk jalan lah you cannot do that what right
cause it's a three hour wedding then they also oh might as well aku dah datang pukul sebelas might as well aku datang pukul sepuluh tengok dorang nikah you know that kind of thing ya so ya even the nikah all the chairs all were filled quite full initially I thought is like I ready at ten then I was like wah I didn't expect everybody to reach here by ten
ya nikah it started off with nikah alina seated alina seated already then after that I I just
sit down there ya cause we got no kompang or nothing what
mm ya dah habis ambil gambar kita makan ya
the kalau tak nak stress
let your itinerary be as vague as I won't say as vague as possible lah but pretty flexible for changes like for my for my for my itinerary was nikah
ya so I yes the core concept is there done so anything in between like kau nak ambil gambar ni tak ah boleh ah sembarang
boleh ambil gambar ni boleh sebarang ah like I for me is like for me is like I don't I don't want it to be macam that kind of thing like for me is like I still got time I still got time ya let's go
where the wife is pretty controlling of the entire itinerary the one I told you macam he eleven oh eleven O five we must leave the house eleven ten nak kena ke bawah eleven fifteen you kita jalan then like
takkan jadi during the planning I said exactly who exactly who will follow to the letter and first and foremost you do know that your makeup doesn't take macam you have to tell the makeup oh you have fifteen minutes to put on her makeup there's no way if she needs half an hour she's going take half an hour
ya she don't care she's not going to let you walk out of the room and spoil her reputation you know that kind of thing ya so that's why they're always very pushy in terms of time lah from mak andam we get I get that and everything but the same time macam as a bride and groom to me is like you must be flexible with your time mah you cannot be cannot be very fixated on on oh this needs to be done by this time this need to be done by this time the eventual
the eventual result is that everything needs to end by twelve thirty then that that is your cut off you know dua belas tak boleh ah but anything before that you want to change anything kira for me is like now you can be flexible
and you must also understand macam lepas dah nikah eh nanti ada orang ambil gambar
then nak salam that kind of thing kan and nak orang turun
dua orang gi makan dua orang duduk duduk tengok the tea ceremony
I mean that is considering is still during this period ah I mean yours is going to be five week five months later I don't think it'll be a lot more lepak ah now it's like so strict I've got I went to two weddings no like no no problem
tak no problem ah no problem no problem I think by by by in five months time there shouldn't be a problem lah
you know you you have never there was never been a need for you to pay for someone to me ah especially I mean unless you are during an event a wedding is something intimate now tau macam yang datang members members kau sendiri then macam kalau nak ada bayar I mean you
the emcee the emcee there's no emcee one one of them is just the the they just err okay err dia they just ah okay ah keluarga ni ambil gambar keluarga ni ambil gambar that kind of thing then after that my the my sister-in-law's brother is her uncle okay would like to say thank you for everybody to come gitu gitu just someone to make an announcement that's it ya
I've I've I've always macam felt that
I have never been to a wedding where I'm like eh kau buat apa I'm like I don't know I I talk a lot I will just mix around I'll mix around with everybody or I will just eat my food you know that kind of thing so personally I I I don't I don't feel the need for a emcee lah I've always never listen to a single I usually get irritated by an emcee who talks a lot
you know the emcee who likes to takeover macam oh okay sekarang groom awak jumpa dia macam mana you know that kind of thing like dude dude shut up
ya I don't find it necessary lah I mean unless you what you will have a macam
a company's event and then you want to have a emcee then it it's it's different lah but tak tak macam buang duit ah
ya so so a lot people actually book their photographers and their mak andam and all this kind of thing wedding decor way before they even get their location
to tell you what pose you need to do yes because on that day is first and foremost right you don't want you don't want to be a cliche macam oh semua orang pose macam gini then kau pose macam gini that kind of thing you want someone who's like aku ada idea aku last weekend aku buat macam gini tau kau nak buat macam gini you know that kind of thing then like eh kau ambil gambar macam gini korang geng sekarang in thing in thing orang semua ambil gambar macam gini
yes cause is their job is not you want someone who like does this on the side oh macam okay okay okay ambil gambar okay okay kiri kiri sikit okay okay then all the pictures will be like like you know
ya cause okay like um after the nikah I told alina I don't want to take pictures first lepas habis nikah mak bapa dulu so parents come up here we salam then we get take pictures with anybody but then your aunties came up first
so your aunties err came up first and then err they they came up first then they straight away wanted to take pictures of alina and then after that our photographer macam ya is ya we I understand all this ah they they get super excited ambil gambar dulu cepat before anybody because I heard whatever cause I was standing there
then they say cepat cepat cepat ambil gambar dengan lina dulu
then they all rush and took pictures with her then I was standing there that is not going to with me and her you know is just her so I'm standing there then my photographer then I thought jom ambil gambar
cause I for me is like at the same I want the sequence of the pictures to be macam okay after the ceremony you're gonna take pictures for me err salam parents you know that kind of thing ya then after that then we take picture ya that that's the the steps lah
um dah lama tu
macam semua jer kau dah pergi
you berapa lama eh that time
hmm tengok
buka jer scottish highlands islands and cities it's totally calling me ah aku nak pergi
just saved duit somewhere lah right ya
scotland pasal outlander no lah
eh no no no no no I I don't I pun tak tengok lagi seh ya I I I stop at what season four eh ya pasal after awhile macam it gets a bit boring lah as in the cause they go from the mother and then to the daughter then bila the daughter part like macam
and ya this one also ni yang the one that I I I apa ni
then you pergi bergen
then dia pergi err stockholm
oo nurul ain hamidi teringat aku
terpisah juga ya
nak berbahasa baku pula lah
they just say yang mine also just say the mount floyen
what is ikan salmon in malay what is salmon in malay
mesti ada kan nama
I don't know kalau ikan if like stingray is what
ah pari
jingga kecoklatan eh(ppl
I I told you yang the kau tengok tak cerita yang hola spain with keith foo
hola hola spain with keith foo ya eh not bad you know and no and then they do two seasons the second season he cover like uh he did like work trips so the first season was more of macam is like a charted what is it macam tour gitu macam somebody would drive him there but the second one is like his own personal road trip so he goes to like places which are not so
mm aku nak pergi ah
and the roads also macam considered quite clear ah the direction for right
siapa yang drive kau ah
ya aku tak pernah ya I told I think I told you ya
that was the what's that the I don't know what is it called the express train eh tu like london paris punya tu
malam-malam ketuk pintu eh iffah iffah
iffah kahwin bila eh as in the exact date
oh dia push back further is it the
next year aku dah ada few jemputan
iffah my saudara
then my kawan kerja lama
what why does it have to be my birthday weekend actually yang the cousin yang got married also he planned eleven july then aku macam oh my god why is it has to be eleven july then they
perempuan ada amalina perempuan
eh ada amalina lelaki
oh no no no because that time like ah the minggu sebelum dorang apa ni kahwin I I just went to their new house ah
ya dia jemput then just duduk berbual-bual then he was saying about err I think we're just asking like the school lah ya then I said oh I'm from zhong zheng then say oh zhong zheng I I wanted I wanted that actually she said ah ya but uh akak apa err macam pergi sana tapi tengok macam dah ramai orang then mak dia cakap takpe takpe apply different school so she said she applied for griffiths ya then ya I don't know suddenly it dawned on me just now like eh macam that I know if I'm not wrong kau pula as in kau apa your primary school was in griffiths so ya
eh is it still existent dah tak right
no cause last time kan I mean I handled K two right and then like I I see like parents some like really macam kanchiong macam want to push the children
oh no tak
asal dia masuk angsana pula eh
what is the tempat baru
orh eh mm green ridges tampines green banyak ah tampines green banyak sangat
as in dekat blok kau ah dulu
no like takut apa
termati ke apa dia macam wasted all the recording
um ya my budak nakal dia withdraw
ya but the reason was like they say it's not because of the school or anything lah is because like the grandpa macam is sick or something like oh having surgery and then um it's difficult for them to travel back and forth
so the kid I mean ah over for macam child care centre punya um like have to serve two months' notice so they still have to come to school for two months ah and they still have to pay the school fees for two months ya then they can
like if once like january like the new school year start maybe he will not want he will not really come to school because it's a bit weird to like start macam you know february
ya he's going to another school he dia kan very smart kan so dia berbual-bual lah tadi jer uh apa sebelum my shi</mandarin come for work dia dah bilang ni dah oh ah you're going to a new school um ya it's called little school house uh it's at tampines tampines station and like okay ya imagine three years old ya he's like crazy smart berbual jer like nonstop
ya but whatever it is ya I'm hoping maybe uh macam dah tengok macam gini kan maybe I could just stay for like
I told you right my my colleague apa mengandung I think dah tujuh bulan eh nampak perut besar gila then kena handle budak kecil tau
then dia cakap oh penat ah penat ah dia cakap kalau boleh dia cakap kalau apa dah apa ni pregnant macam ni jangan jangan jangan kerja ni ah dia cakap kan of course
I mean if you handle older kids okay ah but if you handle younger kids susah seh
kalau younger kids yes definitely pasal aku cakap kan macam bend asyik bongkok naik bongkok naik ya it's very sakit ah belakang
tak kalau macam um budak kecil like play group like kau kena cebokkan nak tukar diaper semua ya you're constantly using your back leh ah
ya kita orang macam gini okay lah habis kalau kau pregnant macam mana seh
actually what do head of departments do last like last time I was in primary school I always wondering apa punya orang buat seh like they like always always in the office like you see
consider own free time lepak minum teh minum teh kat lah canteen
orh eh then usually consider gaji besar eh besar gila kan
oh banyak five K
tanah besar kan is it
ah tak potong
a'ah sia dorang gaji tak potong
apa gaji tak potong wah shiok seh bawa balik
I I mean I'm not surprised that like ya earn five K because macam childcare punya principal also they earn like they can earn up to four K you know
climb cuma cuma aku jer yang tak nak panjat
nak stay jer
no because if I were to become principal I wouldn't have a life man ya serious I've never seen a principal who like can leave work on time if that principal can leave work on time it's considered cincai punya ya macam kesah tak kesah jer
but by right macam ya seriously like
ya I mean I mean kita orang dah belajar kan macam macam tak perlu I I mean that's the thing I know they say like it's not good to have this concept macam how to say ah
it's not like um the malas concept or something but it's just the
I mean every career pun mesti ada macam dia punya progression ah ya but
daripada travel pergi ke sini

aku kat sana terkentut-kentut sia the last time I pergi dengan my cousins kan so macam stay sama bilik eh sorry eh sorry then dorang ketawa-ketawa boleh boleh boleh inshallah boleh ya

okay jap jap I nak tengok
ah tengok ni lah wallhub ni cantik lah
I tak tahu
actually kan I was thinking ah yang you know the the
the store room tu kan that wall I wanted to do we should have hidden the door
ya like macam buat like a wooden panel thing and then you open up into a store room so it just becomes like a feature wall
actually ni cantik eh
actually kan my initial idea was letak wallpaper dalam bilik
ya lah ni bilik ah ni hall tak cantik ah
okay okay tiga minit tiga minit tiga minit
lagi dua minit lagi dua minit lagi dua minit lagi dua minit jap jap jap you boleh tahan jer
yang mana yang ni eh
mana a'ah ni macam dekat luar ni
europe whimsical actually actually no lah ini budak-budak punya
honestly eh I really like this yang ni eh I suka ni
where the wall is ah ya yang dia letak ah
cantik eh
should die ya actually ni cantik eh
actually even this one dekat letak dekat apa ni the dining are pun cantik ah
this is so cantik
eh cepat lah babi ah
but what options like kan that time kita tengok a few then after that is like
still macam okay lah boleh lah
I think dalam err a hundred plus ya below two hundred should be okay like I think kita total ada empat orang jer
should be lah anyway pun is
it's dekat mana
tanjong pagar boleh buat apa sia tanjong pagar ada apa
lain kan I always get them mixed up I always get them mixed up I'm just saying yes
yang ah oh that one is yang tiong bahru market kan
ya but I think more or less is confirm lah cause karim punya date pun macam
okay lah it's just satu hari jer apa right monday
anyway can there be a macam
why not cause like every time kita selalu buat like this kind of theme apa
yes ya because that one was dekat yang halia so
tanjong pagar theme apa
orang pakai good morning towels lah
kan I thought that time yang kita pergi makan then I was asking karim to decide on the matter
I don't know I don't know dia dah decide ke belum but I think that time dia ada cakap R
kat sembawang ada too bad kat sembawang ada
eh we did giant ke eh
by the way kipas tu mana
kan panas kat tempat dia
but dinner kita belum choose a place
kat kopitiam jer
nak kena lohei eh
okay kita cari father christmas
like macam
macam carousel
that's very menyemak kalau aku jadi server tu aku bingit
sibuk aku nak buat kerja sibuk kau nak order
he wanted to go there but dia kena cancel or something you know no like the location kena change or something
jonas very vegan makan
I thought we can book but tak boleh mingle
tapi yang last one makan seorang
okay lah macam homecoming ah gitu
I mean tak payah jonas pun susah kan nak makan
nanti edward complain lagi cakap should have change lah should have change lah
so means that is settled then it's just the hotel jer but date is settled lah and I think makan pun is
kat sini pun dekat kan
hotel punya room jer lah
I thought they are going to prioritise yang the elderly or like
don't know kalau dekat sana like
then like it's err pasal plants
like plant nursery with dia punya mak
then um the funny thing was dia seorang jer yang pakai mask
mak dia tak pakai mask
mak dia tak pakai mask so it's like huh
and ya lah dia orang punya rumah kan selalu mansion mansion berapa storey semua kan so they can afford the space but it's already like
one of it was like a cactus not the tall tall cactus ya dekat desert punya bukan
no no is not succulent it's like probably macam the height
no it's like macam the height of the snake plant ah
it's not a fake one it's not a fake one it's not bukan macam kau punya this thing
it's quite bendy but then bila dia dah tua like it's quite stiff kind
yang dia beli tu is quite an old one so it's quite tall
pokok mango
ada banyak problem than benefit
especially like a globalized world right now macam kalau you lockdown means there are a lot of things gonna stop
so macam there's a lot of disruptions
bukan natural way lah like like the business way the business way is that macam kena halt and and
ya this's why I think that it create a lot of problems because macam like
you think about it all the businesses dia orang punya momentum is already there like going and stuff like that then when this lockdown issue come then kena halt suddenly and you are forced to rethink your own ways of err during business ah so it's too soon to adapt
cause macam like if you see about
I mean I don't know about your area lah but myself like ang mo kio this kind of area my banyak orang-orang tua live right then like you see those apek-apek duduk bawah block baca surat khabar that kind just like just duduk bawah block that kind
and you know you're not allowed to go out and you are you're forced to stay at home then is macam
I don't know but I feel lah macam dia orang punya
normal way of living pun kena change forcefully change so in that sense you especially bila dia orang dah like this kind of age
one thing is that dia orang pun could probably be living alone and this is their only form of macam keeping sane and err you know socialise that kind of thing like
businesses wise I think um I think between businesses and societal macam thirty seventy
thirty to business ya cause I think kalau macam
kalau you are just suay lah then you just buka business baru then kena lockdown then macam okay lah too bad for you lah but businesses wise like you said it can be a
err just a method oh oh a matter of adaptation and how quick you are lah but then also macam those traditional businesses pun macam losing out also because
they are traditional lah like kat kedai kopi ni semua
okay lah I mean on the other hand pun macam you need to also see like macam for example cik limah punya kedai mee rebus tu
but I think about limitation leh macam like for example the reason why maybe cik limah tak pergi digital is is maybe because dia punya um expertise is not there then kalau she go digital pun macam siapa nak tolong dia kat kedai to go digital and the reason why maybe she doesn't want to even be on grabfood is probably because she only have maybe one helper help dekat the shop then if if her shop is really booming the business which is good for her but then ya ya lah but then like on her side pun macam it's difficult for her to handle the volume and then kalau let's say she is able to handle the volume then like what about the you know the same card with the riders and stuff like
enforcing or like really okay lah enforcing macam a bit tough lah but like um pushing people to like this kind of places to go digital
underprivileged families where you are staying macam like all those rental flats that kind that is a point to also kind of bring up because
there was also this macam article I think dekat dekat mana eh
the straits times or something like that yang this um
the and all these case lah basically macam dia orang punya wifi bukannya strong kan like you know you have a lot to handle
aku tengok kat luar tingkap jer
foreign worker punya dorm kan ya
maybe I don't know like dia orang should probably lockdown in stages agaknya um
I think definitely the biggest loser is like the orang-orang tua who are staying in their who are staying on their own that is really the biggest loser because
I mean orang tua like they probably don't have
it's probably just a land line dekat rumah yang ya ya ya and you can just call to hear your other family members voice but you can't see that
cause I think dekat news pun ada cakap pasal the number of domestic abusers
to be honest like I wanted the to kind of go on cause ya it's quite lepak
problem okay what do we talk about pasal societal business err
no ya bukannya tracks semua ada pokok
but aedes is because of air bertakung right
unless lah got one pokok pisang dekat in the middle of the north south line from yew tee to kranji
ke wild boar dekat dekat sembawang
dia orang enforce the rule people will really follow apa it's like you have all those mm mm
kau bunuh ah
apa benda kau bunuh lion tu
were these animals obtain kan and so kalau macam they're like exported from overseas then definitely the home country where is being released
merepek ah
remember there was this report pasal mink farm dekat mana entah
that animals roasted already lah pantang liao
no it's the it's the monstera with holes but the leaves are smaller and it's not dia punya
wait lah nanti dia dah besar dah lah letak balik kat dalam
so technically dia orang punya care is quite princess lah they need the right humidity so it's not that much of an easy easy I mean it's still an easy plant to grow but it's probably not that easy as a fern
cause like it's not like monstera where you can see that that the leaves gulung like that then they will
this thing doesn't gulung what
dia jadi go
dia jadi brown
I didn't know then no I never no lah tak jadi
ya like it cannot get cold seem like merepek ah dia just setakat satu malam jer
apa is standard pokok
ya bodoh
ya so it's a very sturdy plant dia punya leaf macam like those kind of pokok pisang punya leaves but it's err
of course right cause you are not pokok pisang
and I still want to collect more plants hopefully dia tak mati
they never like pakai those kind of watering can no like
you know the food container the dabao there from container dia just scoop air gitu then dia
pail of water and pour the plant mah dia pakai watering can jer
ya I mean they will say lah like macam kalau the top all the dry then you can water that kind lah bukannya hari-hari dia water the plant
actually kan aku tak because uh mak aku like whenever she cook she will buka the YouTube punya
apa tu video ya because dia tak ada Spotify so she will use the YouTube ah while she cook
tapi macam a bit merepek cause last time can misteri jam dua belas kat radio kan so you listen to it at night literally before twelve but ni dia tengok bila tengah macam petang cause tengah masak kan you had any stories on your
kau kau dengar
ya ya the when one yang you were studying at home kan
aku aku weh pun nak dengar ah
keras kan ya
how sia because that time I I didn't know how keras it was until I came aku balik lambat that time because the the tempat that I live kan is betul-betul opposite the
benda-benda tu the and the muslim world
and then dia macam dalam tau sebelah ha the best part tempat aku tinggal is betul-betul sebelah fuchun primary
no no the one that I'm staying in sekarang ya
aku tak tahu aku tahu dia marsiling
the one yang opposite the tu
the the police dengan muslim world
tak ah yours is dalam lagi sikit
ya sebab tu yang tadi pagi yang aku
bangun masa extra awal lah cause I thought it was late but the the bus stop is literally dekat depan like depan block ah so I took
nine six six direct straight all the way pergi I'm like ah I came here within forty five minutes
ya but it's only untuk tiga minggu jer
entah I don't know my parents my family is living there like we just take a rental
ya so after the three weeks then kita boleh masuk the new house lah
ya ya ya betul-betul next to ya fuchun section primary so I think it's the new one ya by tak tu kat
ya tu aku tu aku tak berani because the next bus kan yang pass by that tempat ya I saw like oh
ya I'm like okay tak apa aku tak nak pergi sini
macam mana kau masuk the sekolah like is it they give you
like is it like macam kalau secondary school kan like dia orang kasi like that booklet kan untuk uh like you can either apply directly atau you go through the system kan then for primary apa like kau apply directly or
kau fikir ni TOTO ke apa
that one aku tak tahu ah because their
so that's what your what your parents bid ah ya but ya and hantu
mmhmm kau primary school ada cadet
apa seh tu korang kena belajar history
huh founder kat singapore
ya betul lah ya
asal oh okay
because my school punya like very limited so dia orang cuma ada like sports
uh apa lagi eh
I think that's about it and then when bila aku baru nak graduate then dia offered arts
so like dari like from primary school uh I was in track and field uh apa nama benda tu tak tak it's not netball
aku tengok home econs aku macam apa kau orang belajar kat sini ya they learn how to cook there was a competition for cooking
home econs belajar apa
oh aku dengar for like for the exam you literally have to cook
like oops tak apa darurat
oh no they say like kalau ha you can it's like god purposely let you makan because ya five minutes
I never studied music so bila aku kat poly kan
because in poly I joined the percussion punya band
and then there was this one part of the test where the instructor ajar kita orang how to read music tapi aku lost gila ya
aku lost because like he was teaching us like paradiddle ke apa entah how to do the how to keep how to macam ha stay in beat and listen to the rhythm ke apa because our instructor tu was from yuhua punya like some band thing ah
aku just lost so dia macam we had to pass the test and we had to learn how to draw the symbols semua a'ah
okay lah aku aku pass the paper lah but the actual practical aku macam huh
dengan flute kan tak eh
oh oh that's recorder oh aku teringat squidward clarinet
tu bukan gong lah merepek
the what rebana
oh that one is like dia macam xylophone gitu kan it's something like that lah tapi dia like circle circle
but ya kau jadi apa malay dance
fusion macam mana kau joget sia
handball aku tak tahu uh huh
actually lah at first macam macam malas kan but then after awhile then you're like okay
camp qiam ah
uh I think ada lah because we had this program in primary six yang eh kaki kau ada semut
uh and then apa tu that one kita it's like uh like you know those masa adam khoo punya camps
everytime ada camp kan mesti ada that night walk tau ya and then before night walk they will always show you cerita hantu tau atau cerita seram before that so for that for that one they showed us uh movie the orphan I think
honestly aku tak ingat because
it was quite scary because the sekolah that we had to go was wak tanjong ya then wak tanjong kan it's like
macam kampung lama right I think it was like rumah orang ah dulu
ya then so macam we had to crawl over stuff and benda semua tapi aku mesti teringat mesti ada hantu kat sini something like haunted house ah ya
mm then dia orang cakap ah macam if kalau if you see anything uh you try to find the
facilitator ah because they have a glow stick I'm like habis kalau facilitator benda lain macam mana
oo yang army I think the first episode ke second episode
oh ah yang bila dia baru masuk eh habis dia kena bully kan cause mak dia hantar dia a'ah
tu kat tekong eh tak eh kat mana seh
oh macam apa tu like ha caterpillar baru nak cakap train
so korang apa masuk alam bunian
ya is it korang like got trapped
in the tempat eh
macam dah nak siap to tidur ah
ya korang you take some time lah ya
tak which makes me think sebab sebab like kau tahu nak cakap bugis kan ada this tempat where
uh that road is called uh jalan kubur
ya basically sebelah aljunied right so like the entire stretch semua kubur tau and then it's very like rapat-rapat
it's literally next to the madrasah it's the I think the the founder of the sekolah punya family aljunied ya
oh because that used to be dia punya tempat ah like is it like the ha the tanah or the kampung where most of them tinggal kat situ ah
aku macam no because aku baru perasan kan because that time I I was going home and then aku nak pergi bus stop then so I went to the bus stop
literally belakang bus stop tu so macam
sini ada kubur-kubur then bus stop kat sini so kalau kau nak pergi bus stop you have to pass by the kubur ah
I didn't I was like how can it be that close seh tak seram ke
and macam I
ya is it dia orang tak perasan ke dia orang tak kesah
oh yang tu lah
tak seram seh because when I went to the bus stop it was dah malam
and then aku macam it was very like seram ah aku just tengah jalan minding my own business and then pergi bus stop aku nak cari bus and aku tengok tepi I was like eh kubur
kena culik eh
kenapa bau bau bangkai eh
ke just bau tanah like fertiliser
kat luar kan bye
asal eh is it dia punya no no no as in the tempat tempat mandi dia is like covered eh or is it like open air oh so kirakan dia just macam panel lah
it's a kolah right
ya tak comfortable lah
is it a real thing though it's not right I heard like it's orang eh
is it someone hantar jin or is it orang tu sendiri is the one
the what oh they send benda tu ah
actually kan aku ada question we're because hantu raya kan dia actually apa
what is it asal why is it called raya
ya which reminds me of the incredible tales because ada this one episode where
ada this group of students dia pergi this one area kat
I think indonesia and then while they were going up to the tempat kan
uh they dia orang
I don't know if it's a bomoh but I think and then she macam advice dia orang kan dia dia she advise them about the macam pantang larang gitu and then
a'ah yang tu yang tu ha ya
apa eh oh they they call it
nananggal tak salah
no no they the it's nananggal not penanggal
eh aku tak tahu ah cause oh
oh apa they malay peninsular so sama hantu lah
it's because when I first saw it kan oh chey okay no because I thought at first it's a pontianak but then the cerita tunjukkan kan because the girl was pregnant then she hit the fact from the other friends
ya kat singapore
aku tak pernah nampak okay okay then
which makes me wonder tau because kan dia orang patut kan they can go through
like solid objects tak boleh affect them kan tapi they get stuck
oh amal pengamal oo
tu yang aku tak faham like you would take you would pay lots of money
to apa tu get the services of
like jin dengan bomoh tapi like benda surgery kau tak nak
ya apa yang natural it's supernatural
seram ah wait then what's the purpose of the penanggal like
I know oh the I don't know what's the purpose tapi aku tahu like dekat episode tu they show
um that thing was going after the perempuan yang pregnant
I know because like one reasons is because macam like they are more vulnerable and then they are macam mana eh
like they are more vulnerable because they ada benda yang orang lain nak tapi tak tak ada tak dapat
so they try to like steal it from them which is apa tu the baby lah it's like new life
a'ah ya ya ada ada
I mean kita dah berbual pasal ayat lain semua
ya itu that one just
because they they either makan the anak atau they curi the anak atau they ikat the rahim eww
ya like finally I know what's the purpose of that eh dia letak garam kan tak eh garam
ya aku dengar like if you letak garam kat luar your pintu kan macam anyone ha anyone who masuk rumah kalau dia ada simpan benda kan that benda cannot masuk rumah
maybe ah it's one of the ways ah yang ada
sirih eh
apa seh aku tak pernah dengar is it melayu punya
apa seh
oh kirakan macam
they make it into a sabun kan so senang
sambut what do you mean
eh a'ah a'ah apa tu yang the son of a peach punya cerita kan they were saying macam this hospital dia cakap
uh dia tengah beranak kan and then she saw a white figure then the nurse cakap oh that one is normal usually when people give birth they always see that figure
so kirakan macam kalau like you give birth
but then someone benda lain might be
cause thinking macam sebab maternity work kan like babies baru keluar
so it's seram seh but then kalau macam you are if you are in the operating room kan and then kau baru give birth you know that the doctor is the one that's taking you right
oh that's why that one macam make sure kalau kau kat dalam kan you have someone like your family there so they can ha okay okay
oh but then masih baru kan the
oh ya ya ya tidur mati ah
kau tak baca doa tidur eh asal eh
oo so if it wakes you up then different story ah ha bodoh lah
but apa yang dia call it apa err it's not khayalan it's like
ya betul
the he looked up the stuff kan then he saw that actually jin dengan you cannot see jin and syaitan because they are in a different dimension ya so
ya so what happens is that because kau kena apa tu hasut kan
macam is just playing in your head so the syaitan hasut you and then kirakan they like they are the ones that showing you these images in your head but actually you cannot see them because if you can see if you can see them means you can see the entire dimension tau everything that exist in that dimension
ya macam that's why macam you nampak benda tapi orang lain tak nampak kan ya
also orang lain yang kena ah
kau pergi jahit malam-malam apa cerita okay
wait so that's one of the ways they kacau you ah
so kirakan dia orang actually pegang kau or they just make you think that ada orang pegang kau
ha dia orang selalu buat kan macam like those supernatural punya like
ya I remember I watched the one yang kat malaysia kan where they the the whole entire team
kat luar rumah and then they will send someone into the one of the rooms and then the person will be lying on the ground
and then like baca-baca something basically like inviting the hantu gitu ah
ya but then it's like damn scary because apa tu
like the the thing will come to them right and then apa tu
macam mana eh the the pintu semua gerak and then they will see like lights and then they will hear sounds and everything
and then and then the person will like try to exit to go back to dia punya the team outside right
like usually when they go out they we have like a a bomoh on standby gitu ya
and then when they go until they will like it it's always like dia orang macam trembling or shivering or they say like dia orang ada rasa benda
ya why ah is it like singapore like dia orang tak kacau sangat
so you telling me that the hantu also like shifted back to the kampung then oh it became less popular eh less demand
oh I think it's because like is it like people in singapore tak practise as much as those
and also because like we don't have much of the resources juga ah ya really like maybe ada memang ada lah but like
and like the pantang larang for bomoh right is more
ya it's so leceh satu and then it's like for the rest of your life or for as long as you are using it kan but for if you go for plastic surgery it's like
like kan dia cakap tak boleh you cannot walk under the galah but then kat kampung dulu dia orang pakai galah kot
I I thought they use the clothes line the string tak eh
and kenapa galah like aku aku tak faham huh what's that
properties ah then what if it's made out of metal atau plastic
no bila macam those extendable galah kan that one made of metal what no meh
like you will perah the thing first what before you gantung
kau tau jemur ke apa ya
so kirakan like when you absent-mindedly walked under the galah lah ha
what's eh wait but for susuk kalau terkeluar you can just masukkan balik kan
it's macam mana eh it's it's this actual peniti kan something like that
I know like there used to be this show dekat suria where
where they show no not cerita hantu it's
err they ya ya so one of it is susuk they show like how the bomoh will masukkan the susuk then they will like oh it's sakit sikit tau so they masukkan
and then like if kalau kau histeria kan you can see the needles in your face
but then macam but they say like kalau the person who the person who masukkan
is the only person who can keluarkan
is it so if like ya unless unless if you go under the galah and then dia jatuh sendiri ah
it's either you cannot die or cause susah nak mati like the nazak right
but tetap can die lah so okay ah
because if you cannot die ah habis suffer like that
so tak mati ah oh take it out
the kafan and everything
ya but it's like you tangan semua
bodoh sejuk siol
dah lah tak tak pakai stokin
wait so they don't they don't bury you with kain batik kain batik is before kan
the funeral right oh chey ya so kiranya bila masuk kau keluarkan dari batik ah
nasi lemak oh tak ah no no no because kan
kalau kau dah keluarkan the
batik kan would you want to still use the batik
atau like the the the soil wouldn't stay right ya
err she said like ni orang-orang dulu kata ah macam if you are at the funeral kan jangan diri depan kaki mayat because in case kalau bukan-bukan kalau like the person pernah ada simpan barang kan they might pass it to you ya so don't like stand I don't know how true this is ah but
ya but I thought like kalau
so if like they ask you ya that's what I thought ah my mum you supposed to pass the thing bila dia masa hidup kan not bila dah mati
no as in the roof is what boleh buka oh okay okay okay
oh my god my mum like the interview she said like uh she would work right and then she would take leave then when her ask when her friends asked her like eh you took leave where you go the she said I won't go I'm gonna stay home and gosok baju and then aku macam ya she did I was like then what do you do for fun no lah I just stay home ah if my friends invite me maybe we go
like watch movie or what but after that I come back home I take leave so that I can wash everyone's clothes at home lah gosok baju semua because ya
ya and then like it's not like dua tiga orang tau like in the house there's like ten plus people I'm like why
last movie I watched I think I think aku tengok dengan anwar dengan irna
what is it ah I think was it house in the clock with the walls you know the one yang ada cate blanchett dengan uh jack black
aku selalu aku tak selalu tengok movie pe
like a more human version of it feels like justice league um dia macam untuk apa ni macam budak-budak kecil ni semua kan ya then the boys is like untuk
ah orang lebih tua ah macam kita orang ah
ya cause it's it's macam really really dark
okay lah it's not bad lah I guess dia punya dia punya selection is quite
sikit lah
ah compared to like netflix ya dia tak ada banyak sangat uh cerita
ya dia orang dia orang baru
ya pasal
ya that time that time akmal akmal datang rumah aku abeh kita orang tengok dia punya first episode and then

ya aku aku
I still like macam ada kawan on the game and it's quite fun also so like I thought like
dia orang tak kisah pasal kita orang sia dia orang kisah pasal duit jer
smite smite aku kadang-kadang masih tengah main dengan apa ni muhammad ilyas semua
oh tu pasal dia tak boleh main dengan aku ah that time
serious ah it's that bad but but aku aku baru main dengan dia seh that time

oh wait but I mean how old can how how old can the lembu be sia
in a situation where kampung is still
present you know and then like they need so many lembu
I mean like nobody care less somebody's lembu
oh kau film kat sana

aku nak pergi sia
ada ramai orang tinggal sana eh
then dia orang kerja apa seh
then waktu tu dah dah malam eh

and then and then join the let them join lembu in pulau
oh ya sia I think I think last time aku pergi zoo dah lama seh maybe like tiga tahun yang lepas
kesian old age right they said

kalau kalau kau ada tiga wishes kau nak kau nak wish apa
how different it will be if we apa we never had COVID

tak ingat seh I think like since COVID about
asal kau ketawa ah kau teringat something ah ni kan mesti
a'ah that time yang aku video call kau tu lah yang kau ingat tak what happen that time
tu ah
kerja aku rabak juga ah like because I don't know whether
um kerja aku recently buang orang like at least two K of the staff are gone so right now I mean the ones that are left semua nak kena buat you know pick up the slack abeh lagi banyak kerja kena buat
everything can be done via the laptop lah but the only reason why we need to go back is because we need to apa tu collect dia punya physical mails
eh aku tak boleh imagine sia like I will I cannot even you know
both of us ada short attention span and like to have
abeh like you can't even like focus and
banyak orang juga like you know stress eat
I see I will check that out I think one day aku check it out
oh that's fun speaking of joget recently also like literal you know literally yesterday err me and my sister we just on like random youtube videos just follow through macam dance punya youtube videos which is quite fun you know at least when you're dancing kan kau you don't feel I mean you're burning fats but you're having fun so you don't dread you know like as opposed to kau buat like um
HIIT workouts I mean that works better lah because you know it's a specific punya macam err they target specific areas of your body to workout right but then when you're dancing you're moving your whole body and then you are having fun also so and then um she she we decided to because we have four I mean she we decided to apa tu download
this thing err this game apa just dance eh ya so we've had we've yet to try that err it's going to be fun I mean honestly as much as we hate to workout
like you feel more refreshed abeh nanti kau tak feel so lethargic when you're working you know like people say they always have no time err always very busy but if they make time at least like ten minutes in the morning or before you go to bed that works as well like little bit goes a long way
I'm not one to preach but it is important lah cause now also zaman sekarang kita makan semua sembarang all fast food and things like that you know as compared to zaman dulu kan they're more much more
it doesn't matter how long ten minutes pun jadi ah
highly ambitious niat tu ada but selalu tak kesampaian like I set my alarm on at six in the morning everyday macam berangan ah like macam kau nak oh berangan nak jogging at around the neighbourhood for at least an hour or like at least half an hour ah
and then lepas tu start the start my day right you know working and then like macam feel refreshed okay that happened just like once or twice
ya like you said ah tadi you just have to be consistent ah
kena monitor ah
ya like macam if you eat healthy you clean you eat clean it will show like your skin your complexion
will show that you're glowing you macam tak nampak so tired or worn out tau
aku memang suka like dark err like because I don't know like
entah eh macam tak lawa sangat ah
ya I hang it like macam fairy lights around dia punya ni ah my my bedroom punya frame
and then I took it down I actually still have it lah and then macam because I prefer to use like macam candles more sexy and cosy and then like you know with the smell and stuff like that kalau fairy lights when you switch it on kan
I think the orangey type I guess there is different settings ah different modes that you can choose from like macam those like blinking ones or like macam alah you know macam lampu lap lip lah basically
ya I use it is dia macam aurora lights
no lah I mean I don't switch it on when I'm asleep lah bila aku nak you know feeling spa day nak relax then I on the spa music and then light on my candles
bila aku nyanyi ya bila aku nyanyi nak feeling feeling
a'ah eh berapa lama eh kita dah kawan
kat gek poh ah
two yes tapi K one
K one yang dekat err mmhmm uh huh
sama eh
tak ingat seh but I know it's
memang confirm primary school lah but I don't know whether it's like primary five mother tongue eh ke apa
oh apa eleven
tak tahu it's like literally after school it's not
ah eh speaking of which tadi baru aku sebelum aku jumpa kau aku jumpa kawan aku lagi satu tu pun like literally random ah like aku tak rapat dengan dia pun like tu pun aku that time kerja part time and then we won't even like working on the same shift most of the time
and then err kita tak contact pun and then after that random after few years aku jumpa dia dekat err tioman island ke apa then random gila then lepas tu we she just went up to me and we say hi and then after that a few months later also random thing we we plan a trip to bali and then I met her again just now so macam random lah like but we click instantly you know that the those kind of friends you don't even need to macam like meet them often but
oh ah tu pun random seh kau pun pergi trip dengan dia juga
anyway speaking of which how's your love life dah lama aku tak dengar apa any anything new that you want to talk to me about
the last time kau cakap dengan aku dia
something about his throat eh sakit ke apa
rajin seh kau
you know macam you gave so much um care and concern love to others
obviously you don't expect the same in return lah kau ikhlas memang but
correct me if I'm wrong if you're feeling like macam it's one sided like you
you know then bila kau sakit tangan ni semua I mean it's not it's not even something minor I mean is a big thing you know like
it is a a problem for you it's an issue for you so macam he's not putting in that effort maybe is that is that what you are saying like macam all this even though you guys have not been together for like a long time
err it is all about compromising and macam if you're the only one putting in the effort and and and being invested
then entah eh do you really think it's worth it then
a lot of things like macam
aww dia blue tick kau oh dia seen kau oh my god
what if you didn't do that you know because okay to be honest out of all your exes dia yang paling decent
if you may never know mana tahu
but if it's not then just end it right then and there and you know at least you know for a fact that okay I've tried you know um but this is really an end to us like you know we don't fit it in in we don't fit in each other's life anymore so kau just
move on at least you don't lay in bed at night you don't don't lie to me I know like you you you you play all these things scenarios in your head kan bila kau like you know
late at night kau tak boleh tidur thinking about all these what if you know could have should have
just don't be hopeful and don't expect anything much just ask him out casually ah you don't like macam don't don't make it obligatory for him
kau tanya jer
and then kau action ah treat him for his birthday or what
bila birthday dia
oh dekat tu
tak ah kau action macam oh my god isn't it your birthday today or isn't it your birthday this weekend
ya or um no you know what if you ask that then it'll be like what if he says no so you have to be like err jual mahal but at the same time like hey you know okay I will suggest you to say just ask him like
err do you have any plans macam a bit needy you know what I mean like if you will say like macam err let let let's hang out you know it's like more casual as opposed to err do you have any plans macam like secretly hoping him would to say yes
kau set reminder set reminder
dia sama age dengan kita eh oh
an hour we should like start a podcast or something lah it's like a good outlet you know like to to to voice out whatever you feeling and to catch up also lah dah lama kita tak jumpa kan and and it's like so good to to finally you know
you know kat belakang and not at the front so
love life aku boleh like you can literally write a book out of it man
my nonsense my lain my love life lain
same same thing same thing about my work tempat kerja err like my workplace
it's like err the shift timing and all is like change dah tukar semua so we like have to adapt lah ah then
around seven to four and then that's for the morning shift then the afternoon shift will start about four err four fifteen to one fifteen lah and now we change to four macam around
then apart from that also I think design macam like for social media ah poster ya uh macam gitu ah
so uh so cerita apa
you like what what you watch dekat netflix
ah I see uh I see ever since uh apa after COVID then I think like netflix release quite a lot of err nice nice err movie or series and
an italian cafe ah you know dekat bali lane eh ah bali lane ya
err macam sedap ah ya ya
better to macam reserve lah
watch a catch a movie ke apa ya really
like normal lah temperature taking and all then err you you have to be seated err macam just staggered sitting
you kind of have a extra privacy ah sort of ah that kind ya tu ah
I think kan macam
kalau orang itu err okay lah let's let's say macam nak buat plans kan
um macam my my friends wants to make a plan or plan out something and then lepas itu
we already like so into it already then then after that like suddenly last minute they want to cancel lah ini itu lah then ya that that kinds of err annoys me ah
ah suka advance planning tak suka macam last minute ah
ah macam my off days also you need to consider ah
tu ah then how about you
oh okay ya I I mean like it's true lah like macam you're not being yourself err not being true to yourself lah can say
certain things ah macam minor I don't know
like you know do do you still keep in contact with your like macam primary school friends ke secondary school friends like
who who is among your friends yang lama kenal ya still keep in touch
apa eh like they are not
then semua ada like ya like married and stuff ya so macam
my secondary school friend I still I still in contact and one of them is also like I'm I'm in a I'm in a band so ya so macam
macam like even now tengah tengah susah kan like some I think some of my friend also dah hilang kerja ah kena buang ah kena buang
so dia orang macam susah lah
kesian ah ya
so I heard kan you suka you like indo music right
so macam huh indo I can see from your face lah you look you look like the kind lah
macam gitu ah
ya yes yes especially tengah hujan ke apa so wah best mm
very err macam mana nak cakap
mm tapi tak lah macam teruk sangat macam
err heavy metal ke apa ke macam gitu no lah ya but
I also like macam kalau time macam hujan ke
macam time malam-malam I also like to listen to macam post rock you know like instrumental lah gitu ya
like very very dia macam macam
just playing err guitar for example guitar or piano ah macam gitu lah
then dia macam ah ah macam lena ah terlena ya
oh start up business takde lah takde lah apa apa business pun macam okay lah err
it's just a macam err small service lah can say macam kita kita buat err this err apa eh
macam you know is in indo I think it's stands for
like like ah let's say people macam request for something
in indonesia they they want it in singapore so we can request from there ah macam service gitu ah
like macam anything ah from snacks ke err makanan ke or err baju-baju
ah sebab I think kan pasal pandemic pasal COVID then kita dah tak boleh pergi indonesia ke nak pergi negeri mana-mana
I like suddenly macam struck an idea like to go and
err apa
like we can we can use this service or people can use this service untuk err apa
um bring bring food or bring apa-apa lah like snacks ke apa to singapore lah like they can macam some
macam ada orang dia orang rindu makanan-makanan indo then dia orang macam uh teringin ah nak makan
actually it's just three months aje lah ya we are still in our macam trial trial run lah kita tengah tengok macam mana err dia punya demand and people's punya response semua macam mana
and dia orang kalau happy
willing to venture out more lah macam venture in
ya like I think this is now macam a good opportunity untuk kita buat
such a business sebab
sebab kita kan
dah tak boleh travel
business I think mainly macam communication ah dengan ah like liaise
language barrier ada sikit ah pasal dia orang kan berbual bahasa so ada certain things kita tak faham then kadang miscommunication juga macam kita nak cakap satu benda dia orang interpret as something else
then uh tu tu one of the difficulties lah
then lepas tu macam err
sebab kita kan tak boleh ada there
then lepas tu
macam err we we
ah ah ya ya ya sekarang susah eh
ah we go sekarang mm that's why
like some now nowadays you nak beli groceries you pun macam susah I mean like you kena err cut down cost lah
kan selalu kalau tak boleh pergi ke apa just to buy our necessities then sekarang dah susah ah sebab barang-barang kat supermarket semua mahal seh then
hopefully lah inshallah ada mm
err first thing eh actually mm mungkin I want to go morocco
a'ah morocco one of the place then lepas tu satu lagi dekat new zealand
new zealand ya uh those two are depends not really dah lama but I think is err one of the beautiful places kan
but I I've I never I've never been to like err macam mana eh like those kind of err moroccan kind of err you know country ya yang macam ada those kind of architecture ya
so it's quite interesting lah untuk tengok semua ya
I suka macam tengok permandangan mm macam gunung-gunung
err macam gitu lah
ya sebab err
it's very beautiful lah kan like ya I I I've actually new zealand I've been to I dah pergi norway
ya uh uh uh so macam is is such a beautiful place lah
ya so then like like I think new zealand is also one of the one of it also so macam
that's why nak experience it lah
mmhmm macam very ya macam very chill and then lepas tu santai-santai ah
actually kalau macam new zealand kalau kita sewa macam caravan kan
I I think boleh consider lah parents macam err elderly ke orang-orang
yang susah macam kurang upaya ah macam gitu ah dia orang macam err okay ah they can just macam duduk dalam caravan tu
lepas tu relax
relax sahaja
so macam
I don't I think it's a it will be a good experience untuk orang-orang macam dia orang ah kan macam actually my parents pun dah berumur juga
my parents pun bukannya pergi
jauh-jauh sangat dia orang selalu pun paling jauh pun err indonesia
ah ah so indonesia punya view
indonesia punya view dia macam lain kan dengan new zealand new zealand macam ah then also dia punya climate pun
err lain ada sejuk sikit ya mm mm mm
mm correct macam I rasa
kita kan orang melayu kan so kita punya apa lidah or something eh our taste buds lah macam mesti kena ada pedas ah macam gitu or mesti ada
sambal ke apa ke err kalau macam bland ke macam let's say pergi western punya country macam makan pasta ke makan macam cream cream or cheese mm tak semua orang macam melayu suka kan macam ah sambal tumis lah ah apa
ya lah different perception macam orang pergi dengan parents mana pergi dengan
kawan pun macam mana kan ya so
ya if if for me maybe it's sebab sebab err
sebab apa kita macam err sometimes kalau okay lah like when we were young
you you don't have to fork out any cash ya you don't have to fork out money parents your parents will like buy for you or spend like so you don't have to worry about that lah but with friends ah you have to consider all of these things lah budgeting lah apa all that
like when that time I went to err europe ah then I experience the snow and all so it was err quite fun like you can have snowball fights semua ya then like you do all the silly silly things lah ya that we you don't get to experience in singapore kan
ya so but err how to say macam the aesthetic
uh I think jackets at least we can still save lah for our next few trips ke apa ya ya hopefully get to experience again
err oh ya okay dah pernah pergi lah ya I went before uh once ya
so I think you also went to korea right if I'm not wrong korea like huh korea and japan I think there are a lot of similarities but but the difference is I think in the terms of macam
orang dia you know macam like the the people there are really polite
polite gila like they
mm you should try the apa
err I'm not really but depends lah on the circumstances macam if you ask me to go skydiving err part of me would want but part of me will be scared lah of course ya cause like I'm that that afraid
ya I think I I don't I cannot I cannot even bunuh that spider because
ya so eventually I think we just let it be we just macam like throw things at it and slowly the spider went out of the house
tak lah tak ada lah ya ya ya ya this one I think can say quite
not not so hairy lah the normal tipis but but it looks it's like the size of my palm lah around there
cockroach dah mati bare hands tak boleh lah cockroach is quite dirty
macam kan
dia punya kulit tu macam keras then like I don't know I cannot tak boleh imagine macam mana orang makan
orh maybe when lepas dia orang dah kukus then dia jadi
lembut sikit lah is it
that's great sorry uh I didn't hear you just now you were saying uh you buat apa sekarang
oh eh ah ah eh like why why would you participate kalau you indonesian sorry
indonesian I see uh freelance tu kat mana
like how how do you find the freelance job macam mana
oh that's that's great because um actually macam kalau I pun tengah cari-cari kerja lah sebab um recently I just quit my job because of ya ya because of some um apa kesihatan ah related to kesihatan um ethics so macam I not quit lah I taking a break so but I tak tahu I nak continue ke tak
ya so I'm I'm looking for jobs to so macam that's interesting um maybe I can like to try to look uh look for this kind of jobs too
ah ah like I I feel like I woke up everyday like macam rasa tak happy gitu seh like nak pergi kerja alamak
hmm so like uh as of now I I tak tahu if like it's not my passion or like it's not it's not my rezeki or what because I really feel like uh I used to really passionate about this tapi macam sekarang macam dah malas nak pergi then macam really tak tahu lah if I should continue or not but like now I'm taking like maybe two months break
oh okay so what like sekarang like what line you you at like uh what industry
ya but I pun macam not really um into it yet macam how how do I say it macam dulu I
baru jer baru jer because
ya I baru graduate uh last year as in actually this year lah the apa tu during the period actually suppose to have our um ceremony kan tapi tak boleh ya so I'm the unlucky batch
ya um ya so um I I got into an internship dia ajar bukan ajar lah tapi macam it's speech and drama so I um my course actually applied drama and psychology uh so macam my interest is more to theater and stuff ya they macam post me to uh this early childhood not early childhood lah tapi macam like somewhat macam budak-budak dia macam actually interested uh tapi I got confuse I think I more interested in the uh in the drama side instead of teaching budak-budak
when I was in internship oh uh so pagi kita okay uh so the internship place is actually at enrichment centre so pagi uh tak ada apa-apa it's just admin job then the admin job pun macam like tak susah sangat lah I mean like it was difficult because halfway kita punya supervisor then like a lot of teachers left in uh the company because of some things happen uh then uh so that's why the intern had a lot a lot more jobs to do in the morning but then like afternoon then baru macam kalau ada budak-budak datang for class kan then we are just I'm the teacher's assistant then the teacher assistant just uh tolong the teacher to just hype the class nanti kalau cikgu dia cakap something funny then we're just like uh apa tu oh my god isn't it funny like that kind of thing lah macam stupid gitu tapi macam
ya it's like to encourage them to macam speak up macam do do the drama with them macam we will have like um dramas uh drama train which will bring them to the drama drama island then in that drama island the teacher will be in another role
ya so like now I tak tahu if I nak sambung kerja dengan budak-budak or like I I'm just interested in the dramas side
um actually it's not like allow allow not like dia orang suka-suka nak allow but it's like um it's a bit unethical for me to work there also lah because like err I've been having macam low moods and stuff so macam kesian the budak-budak lah
hmm I honestly tak tahu seh because like because right now that's a lot of thing that happening so macam I I tak tahu if it's because of my um my job only or is it because of my whatever that is happening in my life that contributes to how I feel right now that's why I'm um but I I came clean to my boss like I bilang dia uh whatever that's been happening in my life then she say lah macam uh I don't think you're you're capable of working now so macam I need to macam set my head straight lah uh maybe I need to seek for help I go to seek for help first and stuff just make sure when you come back you feel macam hundred percent here lah because like right now you're a like everywhere
and that's a big decision to make seh because like um it can affect your future if you stay here not happy then macam in the future like kalau lambat then you it's hard for you to change but now macam is the time um for us to macam explore but it's like exploring also is so difficult when you don't have anything to follow I feel
ah tu lah
ya unless kalau kita kerja part time yang macam um temperature taking gitu semua I mean it's it's okay lah macam good ya it's better than nothing tapi macam the thing is ah I'm just worried macam this is just macam just graduate kan so macam I think too much about stuff then um if I take that kind of job now then macam I don't have like much experience in like uh what I want to do in the future dia macam I scared macam I'm not prepared lah but this is just me overthinking lah but um if dapat dapat kerja the temperature taking pun macam bersyukur seh as of now
berapa lama the the webinar
wow that's really good because like actually um when I joined the company the one that I'm taking a break now I actually suppose to go for a class to macam a diploma conversion ya so but then um for now obviously cannot uh go to the school lah the tapi nanti if like the situation gets better than we have to go to go back to the school so macam um I I don't know I feel like macam its a bit more demanding in a way macam and like I don't think we are allowed to do whatever we want I think we need to sit in like our house and like you know like just just sit macam focused on like just real school
oh no uh it's not uh teaching the kids at home but err apa itu it's just like normal school macam we learn about how to teach the kids at home but then in the morning baru kita teach the kids at school get it so from eight to eight two um one we teach the kids at school real kids then balik then err the teacher that lecturer will teach us pula on like about kid
um honestly I feel like a bit macam I don't know because I I didn't go for it yet kan macam I stopped before it started today was supposed to be the first time day first day work at the start of the class tapi um from what I think ah macam it depends on the company you work with kalau the company macam give you a lot of uh things to do like homework macam preparing worksheets for the kids tu semua they don't have like a proper system like tak ada macam mana eh they tak ada their own worksheet for us to just photocopy we have to make all the worksheet so macam it's that already a a lot of workload then kita pergi sekolah we have also we also have our assignment and like test tu semua ya so it's like it's a bit macam scary kan
ya I feel I felt that way lah then macam that's why I felt really macam um I'm scared like I I had I had a meltdown semua
um I think they because there's only one that just uh finish the diploma conversion then she's she also said macam is going to be difficult lah sebab um the tempat kerja even weekend sometimes the boss I think macam she didn't like intentionally do this tapi macam just to macam she will like text us during the weekends macam to tell us need to do this this this so macam um my colleague yang just finish the diploma dia cakap ah it's a bit more demanding from the company itself then macam we we also have the our stuff to do so macam she she felt like it's a bit difficult lah to go through
that so macam she she was concerned about me lah because like she she knew that uh it's going to be tough for me and especially now kan um that's not enough teacher the card the company so so macam there's a lot of macam pressure on on the new teachers macam kita not teachers lah macam supposedly I'm not supposed to teach kan so macam they try their best not to macam expect do ask me to do a lot of stuff because I'm just program helper tapi macam sometimes nak tak nak macam takkan lah nak biarkan the company to drown kan like if you see this that you need to help obviously you need to do it ya macam that's why macam she say it will be early will be more tough on me lah because everything is new then nak kena belajar nak kena adapt to the changes then like uh nak kena apa belajar lagi
but then like okay so why why macam I'm stressing myself kan like I agree with you macam since since secondary school I already told myself macam kalau tak happy like there's no point of doing it like as long as I'm happy then I will continue then um but then now kan macam I know okay deep down I I didn't tell anyone lah tapi macam I know deep down that I'm not happy with working with children now then but then macam I takut because I didn't have any other choice as of now like I haven't explore other than theatre tapi kat singapore theatre is not really like appreciated and especially during this nak buat theatre macam mana kan like there's no audience but I know there's some like macam virtual and stuff but then macam virtual I feel like if you are already in already in one theatre company and then obviously err you it's easier for you to um
uh to stay there lah macam to continue from where you are tapi macam kalau you are not in the theatre company then macam susah nak dapat nak ada audition pun tak ada
early childhood um the thing is like for early childhood kan macam I tak ada um much experience other than my internship internship ya so err I and I also my diploma is not early childhood diploma is applied drama and psychology so ya so I feel like um there's not much of got there's not many companies that would accept me then
ya the conversion is err is err the company itself yang I am in right now is actually macam they want they want new teachers to come in and it the boss also say that um she tak ini ah tak expect us to stay very long she just uh provide a platform for a like a stepping stone gitu so macam she she encourages people to ya she macam looking for people who wants to become a new teacher there
ya so ya then the the the theatre thing macam I know deep down that I am interested in theatre lah to I want to macam act again and stuff tapi macam I know in singapore tak boleh kan so much that's the pressure lah ya I want to do theatre tapi macam I know it's going to be difficult on the finance like financially then
uh for like kalau I nak buat early childhood then I don't feel that happy so but then macam and early childhood is not bad the the pay kan especially in singapore because they need people but then like um and like if I don't continue for early childhood I macam I just feel like my mum is not really supportive of me to quit lah honestly
ya it's it's not difficult it's like macam average lah tapi jap eh my mum my mum is like texting me
that's that's sweet because like my mom dia macam passive aggressive tak tahu nak cakap macam mana it's like ya she macam I um because dari kecil we don't really macam um not very affectionate we are macam okay ya so macam kalau nak cakap dengan dia a bit awkward macam nak open up pun a bit awkward
then macam every time macam dari kecil I nangis about like oh my friend don't want to friend me all kind of things in primary school then she will be like you you go to school to to study not to to make friends so macam like she taught me to be tough lah macam like err emotions she put away emotions tu so macam sekarang I sedih I marah or like anything lah then I cannot like go to her to talk about things lah then macam I try my best walaupun dia macam push or try to avoid the emotion kan I will just like
try my best to explain to her lah macam what I'm feeling this way because this this this tapi then but I will text her I I cannot talk to her face to face because every time I cakap face to face she will macam like um suddenly become very cold then macam don't want to make eye contact then she will just say things macam err err if you cannot do it then I cannot force you macam that kind of stuff you know so macam I know that she's not happy but at the same time like she's trying her best to not macam put any pressure on me but macam that itself already made me err pressurize ya
huh err err I I have seniors but then macam I don't really talk to them macam I really never never like try before because like I in the back of my mind I already told myself like I don't want to start if I start then like I scared like I'm stuck there macam I don't want to stop ya
ya so macam I go for the safest uh option first which is the early childhood lah then macam but the thing is like I know deep down I am not happy with it tapi macam kalau I nak go out of it I'm like I don't know where to go you know like I don't have any interest in anything else other than early childhood or theatre then macam
and also I'm thinking about because I have a boyfriend now then like his family a bit well off lah I would I would say so macam if like I don't have any this is just me lah err if I don't have any macam um any education or like any specific job in mind I scared macam like not good enough you know this is kan
ya so um ya lah so macam uh as of now he keep on saying macam don't worry don't worry tapi macam you know like at certain extent you have to worry because like um that is your family obviously you say don't worry ya
mm mm ya so like sekarang I I don't know if I'm doing the right thing lah because um it was a hard decision for me to make to like uh stop whatever I was doing like I totally like left the company um not preparing any anything for them macam macam very abruptly lah the I didn't even like a complete the worksheet for them or anything but they my colleague yang ah the one that just went through the conversion she macam very quite helpful lah she macam keep on saying oh it's okay it's okay she will do it because also like my partner somewhat err ya we teaching the we we you macam assisting the same class
hmm hmm but I didn't I didn't really have a good rapport with her before this because we were teaching assisting um the the same level kan so macam I was err more of the art and craft and maths but she's more of the language so macam uh craft obviously have a lot more to more to prepare tu semua kan
then like um the the thing is they they have this thing in the company macam kalau craft teacher dengan language teacher have to work together to prepare the craft materials
but then I think she didn't she didn't get that err idea so macam most of the time I was doing the craft then macam balik pun I buat craft weekends pun I buat craft so macam like it was really a lot of stress for me lah ya then err macam I macam I that point of time geram dengan dia lah macam uh dia keep on saying macam oh I'll do it I'll do it tapi end up tak buat so I macam pressured lah because I'm the one who carry out the craft lesson kan macam the one
ya so macam it was really really irritating then sampai like um the colleagues uh ah my other colleagues we very small company lah so macam they they saw me struggling gitu macam everyday I supposed to go home at one thirty like my contract ends at one thirty but then err I my contract pula my timing ends at one thirty ah but then like the the full time teachers ends at three three thirty gitu tapi my my timing kan I'm always there until four until three so macam
no no that's that's the thing so the company macam we already say in the contract so macam it ends at one thirty but whatever materials you have to do is your own time own target so macam ya that sucks lah that's macam that's why I feel like macam kalau I continue to work and go for school the conversion confirm rabak
ya it's a it's a proper diploma so um if you have a diploma already but then you want to to macam decided to go for early childhood industry kan so you can apply at an at and then err and will consider ah macam but most of the time they will they will accept you ah because macam tak banyak in singapore wants to do early childhood
ya tak I don't think is lah because like um it this is there's a stereotype of like err early childhood teachers gets a lot of because um there's they really need early childhood teachers preschool teachers because that tak banyak in singapore nak buat
then um if the company also want to sponsor you then like you apply for the and then you see then you say lah the company wants to sponsor you then um they will consider you if you fulfill the the requirements so macam diploma tu semua macam uh your O level english tu semua and then err they will contact you lah eh but there's only like two two openings every year if I'm not wrong there's one in in april ya april and um october
uh I right now I don't know if I want to continue lah because like after talking to you then macam like really make me realize macam ya I should just macam do things that made me happy because like there's no point of doing getting money getting good money if I'm not happy like how long will that last
um that's that's good but then like um that's I used to have savings um before before joining the company kan and then like but the thing is I I thought I was going for the diploma conversion right so I my laptop rosak so I decided to buy a new laptop lah so because I was thinking okay with the pay that I'm getting then macam the laptop won't be so much lah and I also look for a cheap laptop not like macam one thousand plus gitu ah
it's just like six hundred seven hundred then um after I got the laptop so macam my savings to terjejas like affected already then then like err when I join the company then I got the pay already right then macam okay lah my first pay so macam I belanja my my family to eat tu semua then like my boyfriend leaving so macam I help him with um err not help him macam like I give him as a gift to semua macam barang-barang for but not everything lah within just a few then macam I didn't expect this to happen like I didn't expect that myself will like um broke macam mentally broke broken
ya as in like mentally broken so like um I I didn't expect things to happen then macam my savings pun now like terjejas my laptop like I'm not really using my laptop that much then macam I really feel macam everything is just
it's just cubaan now lah
ya but like I like mention ah I tak tahu if I want to continue with early childhood or not and also like I feel it's a bit unfair if I go for another early childhood company but I never tell my my err my boss that I don't want to work with her anymore
um so but a bit too macam you know so that people don't just terminate contracts suka hati ya so but I I brought it up to her lah about my situation tu semua but she quite understanding she say macam the six thousand dollar it's just for for formality lah it's not really macam to force to force you to pay or what
so macam she just macam let err let me uh apa tu not pay it eh not pay her and just macam take a break first but like err she say if I feel better then I can I can continue working with her lah but then macam as of now I kinda have this feeling that I won't continue with her lah because really make
err I I don't think so I I ya that's good but at the same time macam I feel the guilt lah because I told her that I want to continue working but like um I for now I cannot continue first I regret for saying that lah honestly because like at that point of time I really you macam have a lot in mind so macam I tell her stuff that I macam regret now
I I don't know why I as of now I really macam feel like everything is err falling apart lah because um ya lah because of the job then until I don't know if I want to continue then about my health also I'm not really stable right now then um my my boyfriend I mention him right then he just left for his yesterday I mean he's just it's just tapi macam I had a past of like my err my father's death so macam it kind of like triggered me lah just macam ya that's what I'm thinking so like um he him leaving my changes trigger everything lah so err I'm feeling like really really macam at my lowest right now lah ya so macam I feel sekarang
ya so I don't know what to do right you know that's why macam I'm supposed to take a break during tapi macam my mind just doesn't want to take a break you know you to keep on working macam why am I gonna do what am I gonna do but then macam I need to macam ya so macam I don't know I'm really lost right now lah so I'm trying my best to macam look for freelance work from home kind of thing
and segan kind also ya understood
okay is it is it the connection the the wifi but I think my wifi ada something wrong gitu cause macam I can but then macam like very dubbing
then ya lah I I I understand why what you mean by macam um you shy to ask questions like for me it's not like really I'm shy because I mean I'm in I'm from drama so I'm quite like okay with talking to people but like the thing is um I overthink a lot lah so macam when people macam just hesitant to say something then I will straightaway think oh I'm asking too much and like I'm troubling her or him macam I will start to to question myself lah macam like am I am I like menyusahkan or not that kind of things that's why like I don't really wanna talk not because like um I ya lah sombong or what but ya I I think it's it will be great talking to someone err especially like someone that I don't know so macam I don't really have macam anything to lose so if that sounds bad but then but then macam ya
ya I I think it will help definitely sikit ke banyak still help thank you so much but I just want I just want to say that I I'm really like amazed at how macam you're doing it for your own good it's like you you boleh make that decision you know of like um taking a break and like exploring new things like I I don't know if I were ever have the courage to do that
so it's like I I'm glad like even if or even that I just graduated I masih macam like in the past as they have this macam um want to like put uh put some into my savings so like now macam even though it's very little but I still them don't feel like I totally broke you know ya
so macam oh but oh my god can I just rant I mean like we just met but but I just macam nak lepaskan anger gitu because like I'm so annoyed because err so this month punya pay right I didn't know that my because like in the contract it says that I I can get a few few days seven days so macam every time this month it's just very unlucky for me lah I got food poisoning lah I got like macam selesema lah because there has been like cold uh cold bug around the school so err then I got it also then I also macam ada panic attack in one of the night because I ingat I injured my neck so macam this month I took a lot of thinking that macam you can like I can claim from their lah then rupanya they cut cut it off from my from my gaji then because like err I still macam baru kerja situ it's still not three months yet something like that lah so macam they ya but she
ya but she didn't tell me my boss didn't tell me that is like I I heard macam from my I'm not I don't know lah I I know I heard it somewhere that there's no probation or anything so macam and that's why I thought macam um we I already macam can claim the or what she also never say anything about it then after on like my second last day baru like I she mentioned ah about macam oh I took too much too many in one month like if I'm in another company definitely they will let me go and stuff so macam uh
ya but like at that point of time I already like giving her a lot of trouble you know so macam macam dah bagus dia tak suruh bayar enam enam apa enam ribu kan
err ya lah doesn't tapi sekarang macam I just feel a lot of guilt err towards the company so macam I tak tahu if I want to bring it up or not ah because err then okay there's a there's a continuation to that then macam they cutting from my gaji kan so macam I already had in mind okay my gaji month will be like a bit less but it's okay you can still sustain me for like one month then I can find like part time job and then I uh apa tu when I terminate the contract means I'm not continuing the the diploma they rupanya they will like macam will not get a refund if I apa tu err discontinue my diploma conversion in less than fourteen days
so the the company will have to pay will still have to pay around four hundred gitu so macam my gaji dah kurang then like my the the company has to pay four hundred which means I have to pay kan obviously the company won't ask won't macam want to pay for no reason so like I think my my pay will be like less than half you know this month then macam aduh sedih gila seh
like like I said lah that's why macam I I'm really free feel like this is my lowest point of life um because like money wise then macam like um my boyfriend left for rasa macam got triggered by my past then like my mom is like not really that supportive that much so it's like really lah what's the everything is just falling apart
I have kakak but then like she she move out already because she nikah
hmm two actually but um my I'm not close to my eldest one because uh she we lain mak
I think I for now I should just find jobs that's like um that won't bring that I won't bring it back home macam buat kerja kat situ then balik tak buat apa-apa
macam kalau penat penat kat kerja jer
I mean other than like there's um part time like macam F&B gitu lah guess can can do that tapi macam I don't know I kind of I'm not um I I have this need of like expressing my thoughts so like I don't think macam I can uh I can stay in can do that kind of part time but macam if there's no choice then I don't mind trying also now
organization so they are actually under macam they are more they work more with community instead of err kan kalau like you are the patient kan ya so much as chat is like you are the client as in different different fee lah macam like you just macam go there they already they give a free mental health assessment actually
ya but then like from there then um macam they will tell you lah or you you might need macam counselling or what then macam they will refer you to them lah me err I think if with them then can get a bit of subsidy ah I'm not so sure about that but then macam um because yesterday when they told me about the the err what I can do next then macam rate of like err what the next thing then we just counselling lah macam is forty dollars per session so like I think it's quite okay but
err I ya I went poly polyclinic last time and they referred me to ya but it wasn't it wasn't nice experience at itself because like the doctor really didn't macam mana eh don't really ah take you no cannot ya
last time I travelled was I think that time masa tu tengah winter tengah musim sejuk
so tengah musim sejuk
bulan april
ya bulan april
whoa tapi shiok seh masa tu kita dapat gi ski then uh on top of that we could also
then theme parks tu pun
tapi rugi tau sebab theme park tu masa tu um banyak budak uh graduate

dari dari dari cerita pasal korea dari cerita hantu dari cerita dah sudah malam jumaat okay
tak nak ah
bukan bukan apa zina cakap pasal terrorists ini semua
and this is why dia shouldn't come in yet
okay kejap so dia orang actually sudah kenal berapa lama
dua tahun they know of each other for two years okay
oh habis yang budak ini dia duduk dekat yang the couch yang facing apa
ah dia duduk dia duduk dekat the mirror side lah yang facing the living room there right
so dia memang uh friend of a friend is it
tak tak penting ah
ya and then dia cakap
so dia dia kalau police dia kalau finish a certain number of years bond dia dapat yang bonus itu kan
he's and and so he's actually macam upfront and really just
apa yang susah sangat yang izat tak habis-habis yang macam cakap ah habis kau nak tanya dia punya gaji semua kau nak interrogate kan tak payah tanya budak ini sendiri cakap
eh merepek eh
so what happen you tanya first ah
apasal kena dekat istighfar eh
ya lah tapi pasir ris pun ada yang akan datang apa
nak cepatkan kahwin dia ah
he still thinks it it was the right thing to do itu ah
ya allah okay so oh tak tapi ini yang ini yang revise punya plan kan
yang mak dia cakap nak dua tahun kan tapi kalau tapi dia cakap ah the original plan
duh itu yang kita cakap kan
oh my god susah benda ini sudah jadi so complicated in the last three weeks
habis you tak tanya mm pasal kenapa nak kahwin sekarang tak tak tak tanya tu
zina pun nak kena grow up ah dua dua dua
habis budak itu tak cakap apa-apa at this mmhmm
grow grow up masing-masing
huh maksud apa
oh okay maksud dia macam dia cakap macam dia cakap lepas kahwin pun boleh grow up macam how zina puts it ah lepas kahwin pun can still do this
but I I don't know how much dia orang faham of this growing up thing I think macam fikir macam oh it's just about career future entah lah
mama duduk mana kat sini
mama dekat kitchen apasal mama dekat kitchen huh
oh habis
did you say macam jangan sembunyi-sembunyi did you say that
ah habis dia okay jer
macam dia the leader lah you can quite see that there will be the the nature
so memang dia dua puluh lima ah
entah lah
habis you tak tanya pasal dia punya family
oh I know the the dekat there okay ya I was there last time
habis zina macam mana dia punya reaction malu-malu ah tersipu-sipu ah
habis dia tengok macam alim-alim type tak
ini lepas si ashraf itu sudah balik ah habis
habis this is when
mm habis
habis then you say
supporting lah ya dayah yang kena support lah
ah habis apasal taxi driver
tapi dayah but oh my lord macam like
dayah is at the stage of her life that she's driven and macam have a lot of aspiration
habis dengan orang ini walaupun dia educated ke atau dia kaya ke at the end he's just going to be having this err aura of like macam relax jack and that's not gonna fit well the dynamics
tahu tahu belakang hari dia yang suruh nanti hidayah eh uh tak payah lah berbual pasal ini okay lepas itu
macam it's so like you can totally see right away this might go right he'll be the kind of husband lagi worse kalau dia have this patriarchal kind of stance that he'll ask that he ya worse if you the add up like this particular profile to him like character ke apa if he has it okay that macam he might ask dayah to stop working and things like that lah
habis so you just say that ah
it's about the character the driveness the dynamic of this guy ya dia nak kena match that's the thing okay that's the thing I don't understand pasal
this whole like family who yang macam oh tahu benda orang orang I don't know family ke sesiapa ah yang rasa
oh lebih baik err halalkan percepatkan
macam as if macam itu ikut sunah nabi okay they take that part of the sunah nabi of marriage but the other part of the sunah nabi of marriage the that that the prophet also say that you should marry somebody that is of your standing not to say that it's like macam your social status your social economic status kind of standing but it's somebody yang macam that macam is complementary to like your personality
mana boleh macam like that ah ya you cannot take somebody who is super relax jack err macam complacent you know that kind of personality plus the a very driven kind of person it will totally clash
ya ya but that don't you see macam that is the thing that orang just always pick and choose what they want suiting what they want of the religion to suit what they just pick and choose what they want of the religion to suit what they need it to suit you get what I'm saying part part nak kahwin cepat macam oh ah ikut sunah nabi percepatkan but part part lain macam
to get somebody that is competent with you ini semua tak tak ambil kira ah
uh anyway this boy the call you abang or what
he should be comfortable with it lah dia ada kakak apa
oh so that's when he call you abang ah
so the conversation dengan zina err bila yang ashraf itu sudah keluar it's more of like what what did you say to zina pasal yang the growing up and then pasal pasal making a apa plan habis pasal apa lagi like what else did you address
I think you know what you can from now on you can use this card against her every time she like this like this ah kata nak kahwin nak kahwin nak kena wake up music just just just use this card
kata nak kahwin kan orang nak kahwin macam gini ke nak cara itu tengok sampai perempuan agaknya she will just be fed up one day tapi betul apa macam
we feel you're not ready about marriage because what do you expect macam do you expect it to be something that you will be led by this man who is has her leadership character who's spur and can lead you to be a better muslim blah blah blah
easy go easy uh macam mana nak cakap uh ah apa
itu tak ada pendirian lah maksudnya
no macam gini the thing yang dia nak kena differentiate is ada bezanya easy-going dan tak ada haluan this is the thing zina you are which one
easy-going atau actually you are directionless
you said that ah untuk si ashraf ini ah habis ashraf cakap apa
ah budak ini pun tahu ke tak the background of zina
so this easily two years baru meet up tahu
I mean yes macam I am thankful and it's nice to know budak ini budak baik err so like what izat say kau tengok jer lah budak baik kau tengok gerak alih dia
ya lah ya tapi I don't want after this izat say huh kau tengok macam aku cakap
dia budak baik I hope izat doesn't go like this lah ya but anyway
entah lah don't know whether he has the mental capacity to differentiate that
sambil lewa anyway what I was saying okay
I really don't know lah this the the dynamics of the relationship how healthy this is but then again I really don't know if this is what it takes macam to
push zina tapi I don't know if at the end of this product is zina will be
you get what I'm saying it can really work both ways ya that's the thing I don't want macam at the end of the day not not at the end of the day but at the end of it all zina loses dia punya identity because this she is she is macam dissolving into a very
ah it's so it's so possible you know it's so possible lagi lagi dengan zina macam dia see that I don't know lah sometimes they'll see some examples around the that as if macam she and she that makes her think that this is the
ideal way that macam you know like ah a woman shall be like macam be led by a man that kind of thing and
at because at some point there will be a point that macam she will realize that her identity is being consumed if she doesn't
no it's not say tak lepas tangan it's just it's just that
for the fact that she hasn't explored her own identity now and with this incoming overshadowing person it makes it worse faham
macam because by right this is the age where she should be exploring her identity and she finds herself tau this twentieth uh twenty some age
but dayah said yang dia berbual dengan zina yang pasal dekat yang denmark itu
women like when we say personal stuff we really mean deep personal stuff orang punya personal is to us superficial
then you tak cakap macam dengan zina
at the end of the day zina dayah is still your sister macam you know she still cares for you lah then you know like
maybe she you tak cakap lah why why didn't you say to zina tadi like maybe she doesn't know how to show her care properly but she is concerned for you tak cakap dengan gitu tak cakap macam gitu
then bila you cakap pasal yang zina denga dayah ini mama and abah was there habis
apasal you cannot chat ini
my why is my recoding still err okay you continue kejap kejap ya my recording is kind of
dia ah habis nevermind lepas itu then she say what dia tak cakap apa-apa
no but you know why she walk off I think it's not that she she don't she doesn't see your point in this because I think to her like ya she's been close to izat ever since macam she's been involved with the basic babysitting of the
and just because izat is convenient to the topic that you want to pursue lah cuba kalau the topic that you want to pursue is actually about further studies kau rasa kau akan berbual dengan izat kau rasa izat will be supportive pasal apa
like it's still at the end of the day is very skewed to what is your agenda and what is your topic isn't it don't say that macam don't say that
you are macam ah tapi ah it's not that she will see all this point
habis if I were to ever raise it up of course it will never go down very well in this
habis cakap you're close to izat pergi lah suruh izat tolong ah
budak ni segan silu wow
but that's because dia orang don't even see that they need work on it so that's why they are not even thinking of approaching you to tolong them and like mend this thing you know that because they they are not the point to need or to to work on it lah
but it's hard lah I mean it's also vary in age age difference macam I think if you have if you have not inculcated cultivated the relationship from young also
oh you also cannot engineer it what salim like macam you cannot be bringing the two of them together
habis expect dia orang macam uh to boleh berbual like at a very deep level mana boleh like it will also feel it's so janggal macam it was so it was just feel so weird lah
yay okay um oh my god can you imagine I cakap yay pula nanti dia kena transcribe lagi takpe takpe okay
oh how come ah how come boleh
but still two and a half months pass by quite cepat actually kan
oh cause macam
bila you start the project dah start is it the project that they were doing at the place
oh eh the area dekat dekat mana though
what was I going to ask oh but then macam was it susah to like
you know you you took on like new cases atau existing cases that they pass on to you gitu macam tak hard to adjust
macam short staff short staff sikit lah gitu
oh I think I remember your office dekat mana dia tempat uh my office dulu kan daerah situ
uh apa apa itu nak cakap mm
oh tapi padahal they
ya so macam your experience is good lah from the oh
and then macam environment besides environment wise macam your your bosses and your supervisors and your teammates all macam okay lah like okay like no issues
pasal dia dah biasa with what macam
tidak apa lah kita apa itu take turns
are there ada interns lain or you just seorang intern like or like got other people macam doing their practicum there also
I see okay okay wait the interns usually macam fresh grads or
all macam budak masters or like budak degree macam you know same level as you
oh so it's not macam it's not necessarily a happy time for them kind of thing
ketawa but then hundred cases for the whole for the whole year atau
ya ya ya ya I mean I feel like that's a common how to say a recurring issue in a lot of macam
macam organisations lah
you know ada this issue
apa itu offer so called
it's okay keep your options open then macam explore um you know macam lain opportunities when do they need to hear by
uh okay tapi tidak ada tidak ada macam deadline for the application
ya faham faham totally faham
cause tadi bila I ketawa kan dia punya line macam besar
apa nak cakap mm
oh okay ya I totally understand macam the need to take a break I mean
studying kan lagi berapa lama before you finish the when you finish your masters
tak necessary is it
mm ah ya ya understand I feel like I'm there also I'm thinking macam you know I really don't mind
so macam who knows maybe if I if a a different place macam even a different job a different industry I could enjoy it enjoy learning something new even if you know it's not something that is related to our degree lah gitu
okay is macam zoom is surprisingly so much harder than tak zoom you know like it's so hard like you have to take note of everything like macam you have to make sure everyone is paying attention you cannot
talk you cannot macam how to say cause zoom if two people talk at the same time then you cannot hear one of them so I must be careful not to interrupt the teacher who's leading the particular lesson cause like um when I
and then macam the way you talk to them actually on zoom kan you don't command as much like authority or respect I feel so macam the tone macam they taught us we cannot be like can you please you we must be like I need you to stop
ya I mean right now they hardly recognize me also because I'm not their regular teacher and then macam I get a bit sub ah subconscious a bit conscious bila I punya camera on so macam when my camera itu on so I boleh nampak my own videos I'm like hate this makes me very macam self-conscious gitu lah
so tapi bila I off um I am less self-conscious I can be less
err I can be more strict gitu tapi I tend to not because kita have to senyum for the entire lesson senyum for the entire forty five minutes to an hour so macam
kalau macam camera off then I will terlupa to senyum gitu lah ya so a lot of things to take note macam
tapi dia orang macam type nonsense tau macam hi hi hi hi macam
kalau answer dia A they be like A A A A then I'm like
kind of thing you know so it's like ugh but then okay lah they are cute and I'm getting the hang of it I think tapi ah last week I did not teach because um oh so on thursday I injured my back
I went to the gym to the gym and then I injured my back and then bila I balik
no one week ago so ya so one week ago I tak warm up lah it was really stupid I forgot to warm up and then I just angkat berat then I felt like macam a sharp pain in my back then I was like oh no
so I thought I thought macam okay okay is it because I'm sore asal asal macam susah ini I feel like everything feels heavier and more I I feel like everything was sore I thought okay maybe
be sakit lah then macam I really messed up like aiya something is wrong lah this not normal this not like normal soreness it's like probably a sprain or a strain on my back tapi I continue whatever I can but lepas I balik I had a class lah and then during the class I told them I will be lambat sikit because
I am moving very slowly so be like my neighbour macam this slow then I I drop my soap and I couldn't bend to pick it back up
kind of thing so macam so when I joined the class they were very understanding sorry I joined the class usually kita will jumpa about half an hour before the kids come in so I came in about twenty minutes before the kids come in lah so it's still okay
and then macam um I told them about it and then eventually I think after the class she told my um how to say my not my supervisor lah she told my
superior about it not the like the boss boss but the the girl who was like training us and everything so the girl told me that saturday tak payah so macam you have to clock in a certain number of hours for training before we become like a you know a full time like teacher
jadi on saturday she told me uh tak payah kerja because ya she she told me to like rest and then friday that friday also I was supposed to go to the gym cause I had a training
tapi I tak pergi cause my back sakit so I was like okay lah okay lah
ya tapi
ya then after that I thought okay just rest lah macam take this opportunity to rest so I rest tapi lepas itu macam tak baik-baik ini pun macam tak baik-baik and then macam it hurts when I sneeze so I thought alamak ini macam not macam bukan tak normal kan ya
ya so I told my coach semalam yang it hurts when I sneeze so she said mm she's worried that is a nerve thing rather than a muscle thing so I started to panic and then she was like oh maybe you should go sebab kalau pergi the only thing a will do is give painkillers
so she was like I think you might need to see a sports doctor you can like to get an or something so I was like tak nak so she was like okay lah then macam tengok chiro or like uh get a sports massage lah so I tried making an appointment with my other coach who does like bekam
and sports massage cause I read like bekam can help with like nerve macam you know what if your nerve macam err nerve pinching I feel like sometimes you macam you your muscle you pull your muscle then your nerve like gets pinched or something so macam it's apparently bekam can help with that and macam
ya bekam can help you with that I takut sakit tak have you tried it before
oh did she say if tak sakit eh
mm you free kan dekat gambas that's where my other gym is
uh dekat sembawang there got another branch this gym has another branch in the east I think my the coach that um has is qualified to do like the massage and the bekam is dekat will be at the gambas one on monday
err she asked me if I can make it at two thirty then after that she belum reply I so I tak tahu belum confirm ah tapi
itu pasal she haven't reply so I said okay how long is the session and how much is it so macam
so no reply but I read on on the website is like sixty minutes and then macam what she will do depends on your condition so macam either I mean you can ask for her to bekam lah if you that's what you want macam mana otherwise she will uh base it base her like you know on her professional opinion whether you need a massage or a bekam or like some mobility work ah
mm tapi I think she buat bekam angin if I'm not wrong cause I think I saw a video of her doing bekam on instagram can send you
no it looks like the angin one like ada macam after she put the cup like she pull something mm then the thing macam suction
go for the darah one
oh so the dia macam slightly different how to say
err like bekam angin versus bekam darah macam target slightly different things lah gitu
oh the dekat rumah dia is it
oh I ada macam hundred around there standard right that's like standardish I guess
um like consultation dia sahaja dah
macam hundred she's really really good it's really good like if you ever have like a sports injury or a injury you got from like
uh tapi ya she she's a private doctor lah so very mahal like she sees a lot of like national athletes and stuff so her rates are like consultation sahaja hundred plus then macam if you go x-ray everything then it just adds up so like
ya so I'm thinking about I'm thinking massage atau bekam dulu lah I mean kalau it's not like
no ah abeh sekarang sekarang my kaki sakit dah lah belakang sakit kaki sakit because I pergi gym
for training yesterday kan then uh certain things aqilah lah like macam you know she
uh macam certain things she made me take it easy which was frustrating for me to take things I mean it it's not frustrating to me to take things easy in all other aspects of my life but when it comes to lifting you know macam I feel like my ego I have like macam like it's frustrating lah
like all the progress I've made gone so macam the the weight the weight the group that I was doing it with so we were we were progressing at the same pace so they are moving on to like eighty kilos ninety kilos yesterday and I was like thirty kilos
I was struggling because macam nak angkat sahaja sakit then the moment I felt like that stabbing pain I'll just like I scared lah so it's like cannot cannot cannot cannot
ya and then tapi semalam ada sekarang my kaki sakit because my mother this like finisher thing that we had to do so macam like thirty squats like thirty sets of squats so macam
oh really ah tuesday I still have like um today tomorrow monday three days for me to recover plus I'm going for massage on monday so unless the massage makes like more sakit then I'll let you know
I mean it it won't right like you don't have we don't have to like after bekam there's no like rule to not do any physical activity kan I mean kita jalan sahaja
so kalau kita I mean kita hiking right we're not it's not like we're gonna climb a mountain or anything it's okay if we're just walking it's good good for you movement is good I think for like you know aches and pains
oh my god my laughter is so cringe nanti orang transcribe
macam kita ketawa-ketawa abeh nanti all the haha hehes that kena transcribe I I cannot transcribe my own voice also lah can hardly listen to my own voice it's so cringey like it's it's so weird like you you don't sound like how you think you sound
oh anyway apa itu so
have you seen the list uh list pula have you seen the website yang I hantar
I don't know eh macam the jinx tak lah
I mean mana-mana pun ada so it's me lah
ya but most of them are so far for you I think hillview is like the how to say dekat situ ada banyak trails I feel cause that's the nature reserve area
your areas ada ke other trails macritchie is it wait no sembawang area
ya that's true actually like if you want to cycle but well I can't cycle and now I just announced it apa nak cakap eh okay we can look at more sites lah think got more options tapi yang yang at the the one I sent you to mm kita ada the lower pierce reservoir park
and then there's the sungei buloh wetland reserve need ini dekat mana eh kranji hopefully doesn't rain though you know speaking of
oh this one got stairs don't want malas they were like don't forget to wear comfortable shoes because you will be climbing some stairs
oh tapi is it like a like a mainstream park then everywhere knows about
she is married and I think she's doing like transcribing right now but full time like sort of that time ingat tak yang kita pergi makan
yang kita makan mukshidonna oh ya so she was talking about that
not officially tapi like you know sometimes when we hang out and then like he meets up with her when we're going home I thought he fetches her and stuff like he's nice lah he just seems macam very shy a bit macam shy lah I mean like a group of girls then kita kan kecoh so I think maybe it's a bit awkward for him but ya
ya and very macam considering he's quite young he's very macam independentish macam financially independent like ya like matured lah matured
because err I assume her house I mean her house is big kan so I think and her room is big so I think macam he moved in with her lah
and padahal and I think in a way not that it always makes sense for the girl to move in with the guy until they can find a house tapi macam is easier pakai tudung leceh you know if you were like
I mean brother then okay lah I don't know whether he has brothers or not but like you know brother or someone else then she has to keep wearing tudung
ya ya ya I feel like sometimes it tends to be like that because macam how to say the mother runs the house some sometimes lah like you know in most situations like you know she if she's a housewife especially then macam if the wife is also like a
I don't know like you know you might you know feel a bit ya I get what you mean tapi macam less of an issue kalau if the guy moves into the house cause he
uh ya that's true I feel like macam there's that expectation lah double standards a bit ya
not working ya because like oh perempuan kerja apa sahaja perempuan kerja you know sometimes they say things like that ya so it's makes it tough
especially macam your in your industry that you are working in like things change very fast
so macam if you come back after a few years then you're like uh you know some cause maternity leave is not enough like
just the maternity leave okay say it's like three months right around there is it not then after that four months okay then like is a four month old baby someone have to take care kan then it it might fall to the parents that's not fair so macam if you want to raise the kid until the age where the kid is like relatively
you know not independent independent but you know like of you know of the age where macam dah besar sikit then at least school age school going age you know
siapa lah
where there's me then baru ada
hmm dah macam dah macam project
hmm tak suka
I suka especially family friends boyfriend girlfriend husband all don't mix together
tourist stuff dekat Sentosa
wait but you dah beli belum dia punya ticket
cari online ah I think ada yang ada twenty five per cent off eh
it's not so much the beach lah because you all are going to macam tempat tempat the attraction right
that's at Marina Bay punya tempat
you know the one yang kita pergi Marina Barrage itu hari oh because you took Jihan punya car um
before you sampai Marina Barrage before you turn ya it will be but I also never go to satay satay by the bay before
ada air-con tak
alah are you going malam or pagi
oh ya ya ya ya your friend ya your friend did that right tapi tu buat sendiri ke atau
yang your own is
oh tak de tentage ah
sebab kalau nak tentage you can take mine
orh ya lah I mean is at one corner lah if that's what you want kalau you nak orang tak kacau then okay lah
ours was quite open dia exposed ah so
uh given the circumstances I think that's not bad lah but I think I saw some of them duduk dekat nearer to the lift area that one tak kena panas sangat
but pernah tak
ya kalau tak pernah then better don't
Seah Im kat luar lah park kat luar
no no no I think you shouldn't tell him jangan bawa motosikal because if he doesn't bring his bike then dia rasa macam
asal eh normally we ya
but muka girlfriend dia muka poker face tak is it she can ah
following each other's plan can but kalau the partner like me like that last minute say don't want ah I want today I got I got cramp ah I decide not to go to Sentosa then habis
because marina barrage dia punya jauh tau
because because Sentosa tak ada kereta senang that one you just take the monorail pay one entrance fee and you can take
I seriously think that's a good idea too because Sentosa nak keluar pun leceh
cable car then yang Carlsberg tu
yang pusing pusing the thing that pusing
then apa sia yang lima
I went I don't think I've been to the one yang dekat Singapore
Hong Kong I went to Bangkok tak salah eh with my husband once
but ya you share with me ah I also want to see eh since my staycation dah kena cancel kan so
ya then you make him jalan also
but I'm pretty sure dia penat from going for kelas mengaji okay that's wrong but
dia kat mana dia dekat  bukan Tampines
because kalau daripada Tampines actually it's a bit more difficult lah dia kalau daripada west area lagi senang kan
I see oh it's not like she go and jumpa him somewhere and then they
yeah ni macam papa lah
oh last entry dia bukan tutup last entry
bukan tutup so that means uh last
last entrance normally tutup one hour later ah
I don't like to be the one who has to surprise the birthday person because susah you really have to macam tak de
tak ada secrets out
berapa orang sia
for eleven that's mahal leh
um nasi goreng tom yum
you have to see you know whether you have to make oh but because it's a hawker centre tak yah buat reservation ah
habis lah
I think kalau
potluck ah macam picnic style ah
ya if satay by the bay let's say penuh nak mams kan then you find in that area apa lagi kedai makan [ah]
cuma now we are not at Sentosa if you at Sentosa then ada banyak options ah
dekat Vivo banyak apa makanan
no oh my god dorang ni
nasib Zaki beli berapa banyak water bottle dia beli I think about
enam tujuh ada mineral water
because now the weather like sekejap panas sekejap sejuk
sekejap panas then the next thing hujan
oh dia kulit tebal lah
korang tiga orang aje eh
no si
Shad sama sama group kan
okay okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah dia macam one committee and then within the committee ada macam sub sub group ah
I can so dengan dia
ya ya ya ya ya ya I can see the long hair guy right dia punya muka macam
ya ya ya you told me also lah it hit on the wrong timing you say if it's next month maybe boleh consider lah
then kau sorang serious ah
ya that one we got no other eh unless you want to bring the the bapa and the anak and the
that time ah I see my friend pergi
like err kosong the whole you know where the
the one that they always do uh free dance dia macam dance on the road gitu
dia ada the road ah
that one dia pergi kosong lah
oh ya ya no I saw that picture first then you told me dia orang kena buang kerja
don't know I don't know you pay me also belum tentu I naik
like you know the restaurant yang no the restaurant yang ada kereta kereta tu lah the vintage car
cannot cannot be I tak kerja right I think baru start kerja kot
was it was it berapa bulan ah
oh I belum pakai tudung so that means yeah ya ya I belum pakai tudung so I think it's like the end of two thousand fifteen
first trimester is supposed to be like uh they say what belum melekat yet
the flower one dah habis
rezeki don't tolak
rezeki dah ketuk kat pintu knock knock knock open the door and then you're not opening the door
orh dia tak kaku dia tak awkward lah
wait dia bukan jumpa kat sekolah
lurus bendul lah that that long hair guy right I don't know he just give me the vibe that he's or maybe because you influenced my
not lurus bendul I think dia tak nonsense ah
uh lurus
and that's the reason why dia kena avoid orang orang yang macam hypocrite
a bit meh panas baran
no no this this is what that darah muda
yeah I feel like my son have grown up you know dah besar anak mak
once dia masuk primary school ah
you bloom into a minah or you bloom into a nerd or you bloom into someone right that's the start of how you dictate what kind of
yeah I took a nerd path come on then balik lambat
apa people okay so in general people will think I'm one of those wild student okay balik lambat pukul tujuh pukul lapan
bila sia the only time I hang out with my friends is I walk from school to from home to school
I jumpa kat Tampines mart
you know the McDonald's punya carpark masuk right ya ya ya ya
and then it's like auto know like the momemt we see each other okay come come jalan
not like macam accident every day also like that that one not accident already
I think he after awhile he gave up on us when he closed the door he sengaja he never
maybe I don't know less than hundred meter away he saw us already he tutup
then we run to the main gate masuk
no no no I cannot study at home nanti pergi library ah oh standard
sampai library pukul sepuluh lari book seat
sampai pukul dua belas dua belas lebih satu between that time
dinner after after study at night we go for supper huh tengok
 macam mana badan tak naik
I will black blank out if you tell me besok I told you what I called my mum
uh hello mah then she said ah ada apa
asal Qin
lepas recess ada ada test I didn't study
you stay back right kalau ada your you do after school hours right
apa eh apa eh I buat
I buat I buat acrylic that's why I'm thinking apa acrylic yang I buat I did something
we even have a apa
dah buat dah buat uh okay for example there's
dah buat maths dah buat science dah buat geography belum
art you dah okay and then the other person oh aku belum buat ni okay okay okay okay uh it when is your class we copy later then we do rotation ah
okay finish now siapa nak dah habis siapa nak
uh apa dorang panggil
there is there is I I'm not officially on there but uh apa I represented
so basically kat batu dorang buat macam it's something like chess ah dorang buat ni yeah
he didn't allow us to go in tutup
let's go cabut cabut come let's
cabut I said ya so we took step you know step step by step by step
the first guy said naik naik naik naik we went out
maju lah she she's
uh ya ya ya nevermind so we took our time lah since dah kena marked also right we
I think second last day ya then we walk okay ah kena buat detention first time in my life ah kena detention know then I was like
and then you thought it's something serious right mental health lah kesian budak ni ah bila bila bila
eh tak kan mesti lah miss travelling travelling is one of the best thing that I think
kita nak buat buat seh
um you mean before COVID where I wanted to travelling atau lepas COVID nak pergi mana
kalau before COVID
um I won't say most value for money tapi dekat
um dengan dia lawa
ya tu ah I think ah that time I pergi in twenty
sixteen tu I pergi um
okay ah I tak I didn't get to enjoy
tapi sekarang yang kita dah pernah go camper van dekat dengan go
uh australia I rasa kalau kita dapat camper van kat new zealand
confirm lawa gila ah
tu ah tapi ya lah macam macam ah jadi kalau macam
kita punya camper van berlubang
sydney to melbourne compared to tasmania okay lah tasmania best lah sebab dapat naik the ocean liner kan travel from melbourne to tasmania tapi
um sydney dengan sydney to melbourne because we had another group another friend
family yang follow jadi
rasa macam best ah sebab you enjoy more with them
ya lepas tu yang kita you makan kat perfect catch
tu pun best ah fish and chips by the river power sia
I think one of the best memories of fish and chips compared to punya fish and chips fish and chips
punya lah tak sedap
ya I went to new zealand dengan my aunties lah and my cousins
err well uh bila you pergi dengan um makcik-makcik ah dia orang punya level of err worry is more because they feel that they are responsible lah for you
I tahu ah tapi bila you dah dengan makcik-makcik I
err dia orang dah eh tak mahu lah tak mahu lah
dia dah pergi counter dah pergi bayar
alih-alih he was walking on the platform
it must be ticked are you fit ada sakit apa-apa tak you got heart disease or not et cetera et cetera benda-benda macam gini semua biasa lah kena fill
so they give you a cert lah to say that yes I am brave enough to have attempted this and nah ambil kau punya cert
so kita dalam kat new zealand maybe about one or two
my cousin and kita pergi pub
tak tak minum ah eh ah kita pergi pub ordered hot chocolate
kita pergi pub pergi pub err hot chocolate tengok bola kat luar
tapi sejuk malam tu sejuk sebab dia hujan it was raining
um and then bila esok pagi
sekali tiba-tiba um snow fell
lepas tu bila when there was snow err we were kind of hold in because the snow was quite heavy
um the advisory was tak boleh drive on the road dulu
and then um apparently for that year there was one of the heaviest snow yang christchurch um felt
after maybe about what eighteen years so macam lama gila ah lama tak boleh snow macam gitu
ya betul I think that was the first time I rasa snow
err unique experience ah sebab
tak pernah nampak snow kan so
ya ya ya we memang kita tahu it was winter so we brought the I mean for me at least I brought jacket and gloves lah
err not for snow but I mean just winter kita tak tahu pun there was snow that was gonna happen
it was only fun until we realised that we were stuck in christchurch maksud tak boleh pergi mana-mana
the tour company decided okay nevermind we err board the bus and lepas tu drove to another hotel
and um ya we basically tidur kat hotel baru
tapi yang tak bestnya pasal new zealand
um winter obvious sejuk lepas tu
winter sejuk lepas tu pukul lima petang semua benda dah habis
semua benda semua kedai dah tutup then so it was quite boring lah for for us especially us youngsters
and then we realize that wow at five I'm back at the hotel doing nothing but tengok so it was kind of boring ah but fortunately I think we were stuck only for
one one one extra night ke two extra night
so hot chocolate ah sedap
tu bukan lah tu some pumpkin spice kan
dekat queen victoria market kan
ah eh tu biasa pasal kita terus makan donut dia kat luar
wah camper van experience lain eh I think
mm ya lah I think by then kita orang macam dah penat I mean we were driving
almost the entire day and then uh by the time nightfall kita dah nak cari tempat saje lepas tu nak nak makan until we didn't even have time to think about having phones to just snap a photo but that was surreal lah having wildlife a wombat benda yang
tak pernah nampak kat singapore tiba-tiba nak panjat masuk camper van
melampau jer
ya tu pasal lah
kita tak akan dapat experience benda-benda macam ini sebab tours chances are
ya and I think um partly why I really enjoyed the camper van life sebab
sebab your time is yours
I think yang even on that trip lah yang we kita turun tengok the river delta kan ya
tu ah tak tak sabar tunggu ni COVID habis
lepas COVID first destination when they say borders are now open first destination lah I'm don't even wanna go
ya tapi kalau you can fly everybody else also wants to fly and then all the all the
jadi kita kasih lah orang yang nak fly fly dulu lepas tu bila tiket dah murah baru kita pergi
kita pergi apa yang kita mampu jer iaitu K
ya tapi okay so there are two ways to go about doing it biasa orang drive
lepas tu tidur rest one night and then esok pagi just sambung pergi border of thailand
ya that one more relax ah takde kelam kabut takde macam rushing for time
drive ke tidur semalam
lepas tu ah pergi penang
nanti lah belum buka tengah tinggi sekarang belum dengar
selangor tengah highest for COVID numbers
ya so boleh ah lepas tu lepas dah tidur satu malam pergi penang satu malam baru pergi thailand tapi tu dah kira dua hari ah
kalau nak cepat then tidur penang satu hari esok kita pergi thailand ataupun lagi nak cepat terus to thailand ah tapi penat ah badan sebab it will probably be macam
empat belas jam on the road ah so if you are at fourteen hours on the road you'll be tired ah
what's your objective is our objective driving to thailand and then back or the objective is to explore the southern part of thailand kalau the objective is to explore southern part of thailand
lepas tu travel around southern thailand
err I don't know ah tak pernah try tapi jangan bawa kereta ah jangan bawa kereta in
you sewa kereta dekat thailand
kalau bawa kereta sendiri then you might as just I mean I don't know just travel all the way but
but it's tiring lah so what I want is kita save ourselves the trouble of driving all the way from singapore ah
naik kapal terbang nak sangat kan kapal terbang ah naik ah kapal terbang
okay lah memang best lah tak cakap tak best tapi
tak lah bruny boring lah kirakan macam boat dia kecil apa
oh tu juga
bukan bunker lah cabin lah
okay lah tapi malam we kita tak travel malam so you were travelling at
I mean bila kita baru-baru masuk when the boat started to sail
by the time kita dah tertidur boat dia probably
took a slightly more I mean the seas were ruffled lah kan when I think there were some points in time where we could feel their boat swing but because we were too tired and dah dah dah tertidur kita pun tak rasa sangat lah
then bila pagi dah bangun
lain okay lah I mean dia orang jual benda yang ada dekat sini juga tapi I think because of the space that they have
and harga tak so mahal lah
ya because they are fresh produced ah benda-benda segar tu rasa lebih sedap
memang lah
tapi tu ah since
oh dapat dia orang yang burger ni macam best ah
okay sabar which one do you prefer you lagi suka van diemen's punya ice cream ke you lagi suka gelato messina
van diemen's was ya betul-betul yang kat situ sebuah farm
macam-macam ah gelato messina ada macam-macam flavour
tapi yang amorino punya
amorino punya I think kita makan
kejap I tak ingat whether that one were trip ke
ah tak salah tu ah
ya I like messina better sebab I rasa
ya tu yang best dia ah
because kalau you you compare van diemen's van diemen's punya flavours are
it's not anything out of the ordinary lah macam K you got your vanilla you got your coffee or your chocolate double chocolate kind of thing
kan atau
K lah apple cranberry pun boleh katakan
ada apa yang dekat tu dekat tom's palette
okay tom's palette ke gelato messina
ya ke
but then tom's palette sedap seh
tapi it could also be the fact that
benda tu kita tak pernah try ah contoh eh contoh
when we went to borong market alright K break your head right
I I wouldn't say that sebab dulu dunkin donut pernah ada with their bavarian cream
tapi the the ones that dunkin donut jual tak sesedap ah
ya okay so kalau you imagine ah break your head you punya donut the dough is soft
inti dia penuh kan
which I am inclined to agree sebab about I haven't tasted
tak pada I macam lebih pada okay like
I felt that it was a cross between lemak cili padi dengan uh apa thai green curry
ada lah iras-iras dia
dah dah lepas tu I found out that that lady who sold the brownies she appeared on dragon's den ah dragon's den dragon's den is this uh british show
investors yang ada duit bangsa duit melambak shark tank ah macam shark tank ah
so dragon's den dengan shark tank lebih kurang ah sama ah
I I not I can't remember exactly whether they gave her the funding or not ah but the fact that you made it to dragon's den and you were shortlisted kirakan you bagus ah
ya okay think about it eh kalau you kata you miss the food overseas
no lah just wondering whether you have because right now when we're here we're we're back in singapore you cakap oh I miss the food overseas
then I realize that okay lah when travel kita tak selalu makan luar kita selalu masak most of the time
so when you say you miss the food it's those times that we ate outside for example macam
macam makan kat noodle noodle or is it oodle oodle
right like like mi dengan
ya so if you were to think about it again macam is it really that fantastic
ah tu ah faham tak
ya it's the spices sebab dia orang okay imagine nandos
so nandos kan macam oh nak kena duduk kat dalam kedai dia macam up sikit
kan ada sudu garfu
that thick milkshake sedap gila
tak boleh replicate ah eh so far
and it was a quaint it was a quaint non assuming shop kita masuk
K ah penat saje nak duduk
and baam sedap gila apa tempat ni
betul juga okay lah maybe I think oh what was
was so enjoyable when you shop at the ni lah factory outlets
tapi tu bicester village elite ah up ah
bicester ke bister
bukan bicester eh
ya but I think the york punya outlets err better ah
york yang kita punya kita punya camper van um battery mati
tak yang job dia
ah kita dah
so kita travel all the way up untuk pergi york
that's true lah tapi macam travel untuk two hundred plus three hundred plus kilometre just for that macam mm
ah tak ada theme park ah
float apa
bukan luga kan
tapi tu mahal ah I rasa
mahal lah I think
tak salah adults
fifty alah fifty australian fifty sing ni lebih kurang sama ah
maze kat sana ah
haunted house apa
eh itu mengarut seh
eh tu mengarut gila buang buang masa saya pergi tu
ya lah tak menyeramkan langsung
sabar ni trip ke err
is partly because of the weather kan they humid tapi dia panas ah
so walaupun masuk hutan err I mean you got your you got your forest cover tree covers and what not
tapi bila kat dalam panas juga ah sebab takde angin ah
compared to bila kita travel dekat you ingat tak yang kita pergi tasmania
cari waterfall
yang kita cari waterfall tu kan
oh ya K ah at least bila kat dalam sana
dia sejuk sikit oh
cuaca dia orang memang sejuk so kita tak rasa sangat ah
kalau nak pergi taman negara berpuluh lawa ah saya confirm
err at that time two thousand eight tak salah tengah euro euro two thousand eight ya tu ah euro two thousand eight lah
ya kalau kalau travel as a student
how much you are going to spend so macam for us while kita pergi sana we either just took the
atau kita ambil um kita ambil apa the the budget flight ah
so we were from netherlands kita travel to belgium via bus
kita dah terlepas the the public bus which brings us to the airport and that the airport is actually about
jauh I think was sixty kilometres away
belgium is belgium lah mana belgium is germany
so kita terlepas so konon-konon nak naik taxi ah the bus two hundred foreign nightmare thanks ah ya
tak juga ah we were winging it lah
ah ya so the story is we managed to hail down a cab lepas tu
kita cakap dengan pakcik ni ah driver we need to get to this airport so dia kata that sixty kilometres away
at least macam
so you macam dah alamak macam mana eh but the worst part is that we will we had no money ah there was I think we only had one hundred and twenty euros
no bukan takde duit lah but
not that much cash on hand so if we spend the if we spend the money on this taxi trip that means untuk benda-benda lain kita kurang lah kan
habis bila dia nak cakap dengan kita hundred and this one ah more than hundred twenty euro habis kita dah duit dah sikit then kita macam alamak macam mana eh
he said okay whatever that money you all got nevermind you all give me but I will switch on my meter and nanti I will show you all
dia saje nak tunjuk dengan kita kita punya trip ni lagi mahal lah
ya lah I I think sama ah macam benda ini juga so dia on
dia on dia punya meter
so he went all the way up up up we haven't still haven't reach but the meter dah naik two hundred three hundred and twenty twenty euros
lepas tu he said
ya and then dia kata okay you look ah at the meter
sekarang dah hundred three hundred and twenty euro aku off K aku off
ya starting tu dah adventure ah
no but I think kalau spain kalah confirm raih ah
ah but because spain won err I think I think through penalties eh spain menang italy and then ah because of that they made it to the final
we watched you watched that so the um there was a big screen dia orang err live telecast
so kita ramai-ramai ah kat sana sama tengok live telecast lah
the trains tutup sia
jalan ah
ah jalan ah so tak ni lah ni dah madrid ah ni dah madrid so madrid dah macam
lepas portugal so kita pergi
so it was netherlands lepas tu ambil bus pergi belgium belgium flight to portugal portugal pergi um flight to madrid
all the way makan ni ah roti dengan tuna ah
tak lah everyday but basically living frugally ah
um my friend and I lah kita dah dah dah lapar ah
so kita turun kat kedai muslim ni kita kebetulan found a muslim shop which was nearby
you go through your hostel dot com ke apa ah
so um jumpa ah kedai kedai muslim ni ah semua muslim brother dah masuk kedai dia apparently kita ternampak ada prata ah
prata ah so macam prata ah
so I don't know whether it was ah an instant prata or prata that they made ah tapi nampak macam prata ah
so my friend and I eh baik ah this harapan prata puas hati lah kan
tu kita dah tengah lapar so kita minta dia enam ah enam eh kau tiga aku tiga lah enam
itu tak perasan lah sebab kita dah tengah lapar ah and harga dia harga tak mahal sangat lah
true dah tengah lapar ah so kita dah okay ah enam enam enam sekali pakcik tu tengok kita macam kau orang biar betul enam sabar sabar sabar and he couldn't speak english
ah macam gitu ah so dia ah sabar sabar sabar kau ambil dua dulu dua dulu
then macam kita cakap tak tak tak enam enam tak tak kau ambil dua dulu kau dengar
apparently dia orang makan order prata dengan macam sirap ke gula ah
tak I think they tuang the sugar on top ah
so kita dua-dua tak habis sebab manis gila nasib baik
tu pasal lah dia ni dia ni kira macam muslim brother boleh pakai punya ah
and then uh you know how the spaniards pride pride themselves with their siesta ya so there was one day kita keluar um maybe like after one or after the two
ya like they I think the shops mostly will close like one to four ke two to five ah
so it's okay lah as in dia orang tutup sekejap for them to rest lepas tu dia orang buka sampai maybe sepuluh sebelas
oh err in madrid juga I where where when we were walking ah masih masih masih
sekali tiba-tiba there was this bangladeshi guy
kita dah kat madrid eh dia orang bual bual melayu eh muka bangladesh berbual melayu lepak

apa logic dia buat macam gitu

eh kira kan kau datang sekolah just for her buat ni
eh watch kat sini ah
oh abeh kena apa analyse
tak tapi aku tahu cerita dia pasal apa ah
yang hot air balloon eh bukan hot air balloon macam balloon dia atas
kan dia pegang and then pegang balloon naik atas kan
ke rumah dia naik atas ah
javani ah tapi then like
dia nanti kadang kadang berbual pasal gini ah
dia kata breakfast lunch dinner semua is all social construct kan ah ah
there's only one in a few times ah tapi banyak kali macam
nanti kalau berbual dengan dia kadang kadang nanti ada intellectual talk dengan dia so macam kadang kadang aku macam just borak dengan dia macam biasa kan tapi kadang kadang nanti ada intellectual talk
abeh dia nya intellectual memang bagus ah macam entah budak budak soci semua gitu eh
ah macam fikir ah gitu macam dia macam that time pun kita discuss pasal
in macam different races in singapore ke tak payah macam gitu ah
ah habis kita cakap all the pointers macam actually tak payah semua
aku rasa kita kena ah
entah aku rasa tak tahu cause macam
okay maybe in the future then tak payah aku rasa in the future macam sekarang still kena ah cause
no ah macam sekarang terlalu awal macam I mean right now technically kau nampak orang kau dah tahu dia india melayu atau cina kan
in the future pasal aku rasa there will be like a lot of cross cultural nya marriage ah mixed
sampai kan dah terlalu banyak mix then dah susah
nak categorise so in the future baru macam tak payah categorise ah
ye lah ye lah
tapi macam
okay abeh kalau macam kau dah mix like
dalam kau ada lapan bangsa macam mana
ye lah kau macam macam one quarter ni one quarter tu one eighth
let's say let's say macam okay if your dad is like half malay half chinese then mak kau is like half indian half eurasian
ah bila dapat anak macam mana
alien eh tak
macam mana seh tu
then ah kalau race ikut bapa jer kan macam
it's not it's not accurate kan pada kau accurate ke aku rasa tak ah
and pada aku you shouldn't like ah
macam pelik seh I mean race is something like you're born with so kau tak boleh choose seh
construct ah ye lah
oh tak maksud aku
ye lah okay it's not fair cause macam
cause then mak dia punya side macam mana like
kira kan it's unfair for macam mak dia punya side ah
macam kalau the race just ikut bapa dia
let's say kalau race ikut bapa dia dia tak macam melayu tapi dia bukan melayu pe actually dia mix still mix what
then lagi satu apa tadi yang second nya
aku just rasa pelik tau macam you're born and then macam kau choose your race and then some people choose cause of nak dapat benefits ke apa ah tu dah macam
kau boleh choose to
ah betul lah tapi that time aku dengar macam kalau kau cina
err okay kalau kau melayu kan kau bila jual rumah
kalau boleh jual rumah to melayu atau india tak boleh jual to cina
ah potential punya customers sikit and then
and then cause of that kan the value of your house will drop kira kau sell at a lower price ah
tak lah tak lah ada satu word
as in oh okay okay okay boleh lah
yishun orang gila semua kat sana
kan actually betul pe tak eh yishun besar so
betul juga ah tapi ya lah like
kalau dorang buat a quota for private housing then
tak ramai seh melayu dengan india beli kan
kesian seh yang melayu kat situ
kau dah besar kau nak beli rumah apa
okay kalau kalau kau ada duit untuk beli condo will you buy a condo and will you stay in the condo
kira ambitious eh kau
macam sorang ah
oh macam macam gini eh oh okay okay okay okay
tak ada tak ada eh wait ada ada ah aku pernah hantar makan
kat those rumah
macam gini juga ah tapi mahal dia tapi mahal
ya mm pasal ada balcony okay dia dua tingkat dia tapi dua tingkat
ah all the units semua ada dua tingkat
sort of ah dia dia macam ah dua tingkat kan tapi atas is studio apartment
then kat bawah is like the living room and the bedroom ah so it's like macam
mm kira kau boleh overlooked the first floor kan ah cause
aku rasa government buat gitu pasal they want to encourage ah encourage families macam to live with their parents
so if studio apartment kat atas macam parents nya bedroom dengan
ada ada satu ah apa lagi satu pintu kat atas there's two gate satu pintu
ah then connected by tangga ah
aku ada ni ah aku ada sedara yang tinggal kat sana
tak ah
not nice ah dia nya studio apartment atas kecil gila
ya studio ah tapi not nice ah and then like macam pasal makcik pakcik aku da tua kan so like sometimes the whole day dorang kat atas jer tak turun bawah pun
cause everything is ah malas macam kaki pun sakit pe so tak boleh turun bawah
ya pasal dorang ada dapur kecil juga kat atas
ah then dorang nya living ah living room rak kecil and then bedroom dah
oh back to the question so kira kau nak beli condo ah
kira kau nak beli condo ah bila kau dah besar
ah seh aku pun
ya kalau ada macam gitu I I nak
I don't know ah I I mean aku macam tak nak beli private housing
for investment purpose okay ah tapi untuk tinggal tak ah
um aku nak aku punya kids macam
main kat playground lari lari
tak tapi aku nak more macam
not just playground kira dorang nak main bawah blok okay aku kasi dia main bawah blok lepastu dorang main dengan budak budak
ah at those area kan dorang punya kawan ah dorang main main
ah then ah gitu ah abeh
tinggal pun everything is dekat macam private property jauh sia serious serious ada yang macam jauh abeh like very secluded aku tak suka ah actually honestly aku prefer macam
kalau dia punya neighbourhood macam bising sikit
macam so kira macam best ah kecoh macam happening ah ya
ah bising tapi in a good way nya bising ah macam
budak budak semua main semua ah not bising
matrep naik motor perah motor lepak ah not that type of macam tempat ah
ya so kalau aku ada duit pun aku maybe tak akan beli private property ah
tak boleh ah aku just tak boleh ah macam
nanti macam kau tak kenal neighbour kau macam
aku tak nak gitu ah aku nak macam kampung spirit balik ah
kerja apa eh
eh kau jangan seh dorang tengah dengar seh
kau imagine eh macam
sikit jer
pasal mak aku ah mak aku dengan neighbour aku gaduh ah
ada ah history of fighting ah
oh anyway recently neighbour aku meninggal
meninggal mati sama lah
ah ye lah ye lah ye lah
ah meninggal ah so ah orang ah ni ah melayu
betul tu tak rapat sangat tu time kecil rapat tapi after that kita macam
ah ada lah dulu some petty matters ah gaduh
ah sekejap so dorang tak suka each other then after awhile aku macam
aku bilang ah mak aku macam

that's all eh wabillahi taufik wal hidayah wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh dah bye
ya you you you kinda like macam jauh
ah how was it mm boleh lah
boleh lah
like um boleh lah macam I didn't expect it to be hard as it is
it's more to macam satisfactory lah unexpectedly good
ya ya ya and then you macam mana
mm sama sama
mm ah understood understood ya cause uh macam for me kan like uh
I don't enjoy anything online at all from ah daripada lectures
really I cannot I feel like um like like very unproductive it's like err no no is is err don't even don't even get me started talking about it cause like really really really really malas
malas abeh ah tiring lagi so macam
abeh like um macam mana ah your exam punya like err format like how how was it like it's it's online right so macam like how how did it go
leceh ah leceh
oh for mine like the maximum like the longest longest exam that I had was like ah twenty four hours ah so I cannot imagine like forty eight hours was like huh forty eight hours lama gila
like the questions banyak ke like were there like a lot of questions
no difference tak ada tak ada difference
like why you using serious tak dengar
try ah cakap something
mm cause it sounds like uh err dia macam tak clear sangat so like try it's ya like I cannot really understand what you're saying ya
sangat what you trying to say ya
blur blur sikit
oh for me kan ah yours is like forty eight hours so is like mine is mine mine was ah twenty four hours tapi like the lecturer lecturer like give like specific instruction tau like the instruction were like very specific so
eleven questions and then lepas tu um the eleven questions tu like ah the marks were different lah for each questions the marks all very different like some were three marks some were two marks some were ten marks like the maximum was like ten marks ah so like um
ah for like for each question err um my lecturer specified ah like um berapa banyak words
number of references needed like how many references needed for each ya so it's like like some some of the questions I feel like um macam ah tak make tak make sense ah cause like err questions two marks jer atau three marks but like uh dia nak
dia nak um the words like limit dia like two hundred fifty like can you imagine like a like a two or three marks question with like a minimum of like hundred fifty to two hundred fifty words
we had to like really um arrange like how do I how do we answer it like to meet the requirements so it was like um time consuming lah ah which explains why maybe she like kasi us twenty four hours untuk buat
ya twenty four hours eleven essays I didn't like tak tidur cause like ya I mean it's not that I didn't take breaks in between ah but then I did take a lot of breaks in between to be honest
ya and then then nanti last last you'll be like rushing rushing and then like err everything is like all over the place then you'll be like panic and then like you know and then like for I like what um like for for me that the twenty four hours uh punya exam it was like macam
uh it was penat ah but then like
but then like uh how do I say this dia macam
my back crying for help and then ya and um like mata sakit and everything so macam err no it's not very like ya it's the worst ah I would say the whole the whole
like if they weren't lenient maybe I would don't think boleh lepas
cause like you know you know there are times like um uh like I I attended like online lectures but then like macam like I was there but I was asleep
ya ya ya serious tak bedek
all okay cause I had this like um ah I ada kelas ni eight thirty tau eight thirty in the morning so like
I mean being at home obviously your macam sleeping schedule semua all over the place kan like you just like you will sleep at like three like two like very late lepastu like it's a struggle to wake up in the morning obviously so like ya but then like even though like uh um the what apa nama dia
ya so I didn't want to like affect my attendance so like like every time like eight thirty I will wake up just in time like for the lecturer to share the like google meet link ah I would join lepastu the minute I join and then like right ah terus I I would just go to sleep
and then every time when I wake up the class is done like the lecturer is not even there anymore then she left the google meet and I'm still there I mean I I honestly think uh I bukan sorang cause ah when I woke up then I will see like two to three people
in in the google meet and I'm like okay I think we are all in the same boat ya cause no I I really feel like macam
I really cannot I mean physically physical classes eighty thirty I really feel like it's already um not a good idea to like take up eight thirty classes ah apa lagi eh online like tak boleh oi
eh tapi lecturers you semua like
they were were they like mostly lenient or like they were do you had like some macam trouble juga with certain lecturers
mm faham
most of my lecturers okay lah I I guess like they are trying to make it things easy for us and also for them I mean it's it's two-way kan macam if they make things harder for us it will be harder for them also so it's like they were trying their best I guess and cause it's semua benda macam very baru untuk semua orang
I think everyone macam masih nak adapting to the whole new situations so it's like uh I I appreciate that uh lecturers I macam they were they were okay lah but then I did have macam trouble dengan some
lecturers ah cause like I don't know why ah tak tahu kenapa ah tapi like I ada satu lecturer ni she was like um
I mean ya I don't know I don't know why ah cause I've I I I don't err I don't macam I tak I don't really like her style of like how she organises the whole um the way she conducts a whole the whole class it's like
um cause it's online kan abeh macam she doesn't
she expects us to err macam
gone through everything I mean technically of course we have to go through everything on our own mostly like have to do our readings and everything I mean faham lah we have to do that obviously but then it was like I would say like ninety percent like the whole coursework that ninety percent had to be depended on ourselves
ya so macam it wasn't helpful lah she was expecting us to only come to her only bila kita ada questions so it was like very hard for me like ah apa eh like macam cause especially I don't have my books with me so like
I I left my books in malaysia we had to rush back to singapore like during the so we didn't I didn't have time to pack up whatever I need so it was just like take whatever I whatever I needed and then just balik singapore but then like you know so I had I had to leave my books and I really I really I use my books for references like to do readings and everything
ya I mean cause I I don't like I don't like online I really cannot like absorb things online so I prefer like reading like physical books and then like extracting the like macam apa tu the points and everything but then my lecturer was like
ah dia akan cakap ah apa tu
dia akan cakap okay this is the topic we're going to ah this is the topic that you have to you have to read any questions ask me and then she would upload right upload like pre-recorded lectures with slides but only like
on our own so macam I was like ah it wasn't like helpful at all I was like I didn't understand like a lot of things and then like I was like having trouble then I tried my best to like find resources online whatever it is lah to to understand to faham kan
I I understand that she she wants like kita nya level to be like of really university students tapi macam
I mean cause cause she makes everything a bit complicated like the whole process of the whole coursework it was like very very leceh like from the from the submissions and then to the assignments like she was like very particular about a lot of things they were macam banyak gila benda nak kena like we had to follow hers her format
and it was very very leceh and then like
it was very leceh and then time consuming and everything so and then it was group work and which is which was worse cause uh uh I had to handle dengan all those um group members who are just useless
working team members which was hard lah cause I mean you know assignments are like supposed it's very heavy and it's supposed to be like macam equally divided kan tapi like like the pressure was more on like the lesser lesser working members the more work needs to be done right for each member
like I feel that I don't know I I'm just like um malas ah want to layan like
like you know all these drama so I will just be like I do my work like whoever wants to do it do it and then we just proceed if people care enough they would ask the progress ah of it but you know some did some did not so it was like ah whatever like really I don't care cause for me I care about my grades like you did dorang tak kesah then dorang punya pasal ah
but then like for me like I really I really care about my grades so it's like for me I don't want to deal with like such like such group members so is like ah whatever ah suka hati ah nak buat pape pun boleh lah ya like ya it's like
like apa tu
uh apa nama dia like you know like bila physically like with physically it's very hard to meet up with group members like what else online right it's worse
um and then uh like for like certain my other lecturers like they they decided like like yours ah similar to yours like dorang kasi kita choose um nak apa tu nak individual atau group work so it was like okay lah I I honestly prefer individual assignments so I don't have to like deal with anyone you know you just get to settle it on your own
ya ya ya I mean it's your own your own uh I mean it's kind of scary lah to do be doing assignments like individually tapi macam you know it's much easier cause you get things done faster I mean not faster faster but you know what I mean kan like faster in terms of like you just have you just you just do it on do it on your own don't have to like go having to ask or like you know divide work and everything
ya ya exactly exactly exactly ya it's all like on your own so macam settle lah senang kan habis cerita eh but serious I'm not looking forward to the upcoming semester or the summer semester cause I'm taking are you taking the summer semester
oh dah start dah
ya one class aje okay lah tu
same cause uh for me like I haven't I haven't started sebab mm I baru I baru jer register the class
cause today is a public holiday for malaysia merdeka kan
okay tak
oh pasal apa tu
oh jadi
oh jadi
mm or the like apa tu cerita dia like is it
orh cerita cerita dia like what the whole is it like series eh
series berapa season
I don't I tak suka ah tengok series
I I don't enjoy um like I don't know like maybe sebab macam it's either like I get bored easily atau macam I'm just hard to impress ah cause I will always ah sebab selalu kalau I tengok cerita kan nanti like like if macam dia series
nanti I nak tengok halfway jer
sometimes not even halfway I will just macam ee boring ah malas done dah that's it
especially kalau cerita dia romance kan oh lagi malas no no no tak boleh I I really
ya I macam I mean
sometimes you just you know ah macam just to
just enjoy macam for entertainment macam okay ah but then
ah I would just macam be like err a bit aje ah tapi nanti bila dah get too much nanti I macam ee tak nak tak nak I'm not watching this ah especially if
kalau macam cerita dia very predictive kan no predictive predictable kan so I macam err tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh I will just be like okay my last then I'm just I'm gonna finish watching it at all just
move on sebab tu I prefer tengok movies ah daripada like watching like series or like sitcoms or whatever lah you call it
so I'll see lah eh I'll check out and see kalau I managed to watch a good place then I akan bilang you lah
tapi dah habis ke the series is it like done
oh really itu jer ke tak ada cerita lain yang you boleh suggest kat I
um cause uh I when I get like macam betul-betul bored and then I would watch K drama kira like K drama is like the last resort kalau betul-betul dah boring gila then I would watch K dramas
but on a normal like day with like a lot of other things to do no like I'm not the sort lah like macam
uh what I do is macam I would watch rental videos on youtube like really anything like really like suggested stuff right I would I will just watch it macam I picit and just tengok jer
ya I mean just like every like a really a lot of things there kan and macam for me ah macam get bored easily like videos paling lama pun um fifteen twenty minutes dah lah that's it
not like not like macam really lama-lama videos like orang berbual banyak-banyak no no I would just like watch random stuff
if I macam
sometimes I watch like like really random ah like I can be watching macam ah I'll be watching like cooking shows or ya to like macam make-up stuff
or like really like random stuff like people punya like macam room tours or something I don't know I just like really just anything ah
tak tahu ah I macam sometimes tak ada pape pun I will just like
tengok jer check jer it's just like see just see jer like I I'm I do I would I'm not really active lah in terms of like posting stuff ah but I'm very active just being online and like seeing like post by other people lah
not like really really must those people who really post like stories like every day and then like have those like really small dots on their stories tak ah I'm not like that just that I just like enjoy like watching stories of other people then like macam look at other people's posts and then stalk people
not really stalk but like macam look at their profiles and like you know random stuff like really random stuff
like macam
I don't know ah it's just very fun to like read people's like thoughts for me ah macam I really macam enjoy macam baca baca tengok
ya ya ya ya tapi like macam it just makes you like macam talk to yourself like macam eh
like eh interesting eh ah macam you know got those kind of things like is
which like macam I really like ya I mean I really respect those kind of people cause I'm I would say I orang dia I'm very I'm kind of very I very opinionated actually it's just that I don't really express it out openly
ya I mean ya I mean when I do I do ah but I don't do it like all the time like when I really have things to like really express it out I would tapi macam selalunya mm no that's why I really admire people who really can talk about things like especially macam
like you see when like people really like speak up on like uh like current issues like I I really really want to like I really wish I could macam kadang-kadang macam eh like ee I really like like at the back of my head kan macam there were like a lot of things tau I really want to say a lot of things but then like I macam oh like uh
ah uh ya exactly so it's like especially when when things are like like all these sensitive issues right I really wish kadang-kadang I boleh just cakap jer tapi
I I feel that um my knowledge or like current issues it's not like I'm not fully equipped on that like I'm still like I still it's not I'm not I don't like um follow up on what what's happening kan tapi like I feel like
no matter like how much I'm updated with what's going on I feel like I'm still don't have enough knowledge like like the lack of knowledge in me to really macam go out there and speak up about things like this ah
ya ya ya I mean like for me macam kadang-kadang like I feel I takut kat walaupun
my my twitter is like private like private account tapi
huh tapi I I I feel like macam like even if I were to tweet it out like I I I will just so scared of being judged even though like my my followers are actually quite limited ah tapi you know you just have that like fear of people like judging you even if it's not judging you people I I'm I'm afraid of people having like certain like impression of me for having like certain opinions on things you know
ya I mean cause ya cause things like this like you really need you really have to know your way around words kan like you don't want to macam you don't want people to misunderstand what you say at same time you don't want to hurt their feelings
in a way you know you you just want it to be like a general kind of like um discussion like a healthy one lah like you don't end up being like ya you know end up like in like fights or whatever I don't know it's just really cool I find it like macam very cool for people to be doing that
ya ya I mean they are very receptive receptive they are very receptive ah so macam okay that's good that's really good then that's what that's what I find very interesting about twitter ah
I mean I I find out a lot of things from twitter twitter is like my go to I would say macam go to newspaper ah
sometimes memang mm mm sometimes memang tired ah actually we would like sometimes you feel like something it does get overwhelming to me tapi
penat ah baca dorang nya tweets
I think it's just how it is right you can't you can't get like semua orang to agree what you what you what you have to say it's just the fact that you know when you like express things out you have to like brace yourself for like you know back lashes and everything cause confirm have one
oh kalau instagram
tak ah tak tak honestly instagram not really cause like
I follow a lot of people but then like um I get tired of watching stories eventually so I will just like mm I will just like like exit lah when I macam dah malas want to tengok banyak-banyak but some some stories I do enjoy ah but others like when I feel like um macam ee malas pe nak tengok I will be just like
mm mm mm sebab yang the first few ones will always be the one that you always watch right for story ah so macam okay dah tengok ni semua okay dah that's it I don't have to look at everyone's ya cause some people um for me
I feel like I I as much as macam I respect orang lain punya way of using social media sometimes I rasa macam people exposed too much and I don't want to know faham ke
mm like I mean as much as like suka hati lah you nak buat apa dengan you punya instagram tapi sometimes know what they share sometimes buat me uncomfortable so macam I sometimes tak nak tengok ya so I macam okay ya ah
oh cute gila ya cause sometimes they will just like all the um macam celebrity punya anak kan they all like ee geram lah
geram they just really I don't know it's just geram lah
especially those ah I really ah I cannot tak boleh
have you been to like macam uh any weddings like since since phase two
is it yang young counsel eh
pergi dating
letters hantar surat jer
sorry apa
tapi hantar surat like not even
and then jap
dorang hantar surat jer
tak tak like even whatsapp ke I don't know ke like like they don't use like technology form punya like
it's letter right I mean letters macam take time kan untuk like untuk reach the recipients and it's like I mean I feel like dia macam you know orang dulu dulu punya way of like coupling
okay I mean okay ah I think for me right even if you want to keep things like quote unquote macam traditional kan I would at least use email lah you know
you know letters really take a very long time and it's like all the way to medina so macam wow for me I'm I'm very impatient person so macam
like kira macam you know it's like kira macam you have to really
tulis a lot of things you wanted to to really really update you know everything in like one letter then you have to send it all the way
I mean they they macam taking it taking it slow ah
right taking it slow faham faham
macam would you
would you like if macam let's say your parents nak matchmake you would you would you like be open to it
but then okay okay okay okay okay I mean look okay if you were to change the situation kan macam for example
since you cakap you ada someone already like kira you are seeing someone tapi like if you were to change like the whole situation for example um if you are done with your studies kan dah habis belajar then like you not dating anyone
alamak tapi nak cari dekat mana
for okay bila comes to like my love life right I I'm the type of person yang if we vibe we vibe ah so if like from the start if we can't really click then I don't think that that's like hope in it so I will just like you know what it's not it's not happening so ya so to be matchmake right mm I think for someone like me it's gonna be hard lah it's gonna be very hard
ah I lebih prefer things to be like to happen like naturally
I mean I mean I know lah like macam like when it comes to like matchmaking like it's like it it takes time you have to like get to know the person and stuff
which macam I am open to like getting to know people but then the the hard part is like is like when you when you really get to know the person and everything it's like it's it's a whole new thing where you will have to decide whether like is it really going to work out or like you know those kind of thing so macam
so macam I don't know I'm so like to answer your question I tak sure ah whether I can actually
go on with it or not it depends who depends on the like candidate that it's been picked for me but then again like ah similar lah to your parents my parents tak macam gitu ah so ya
dorang macam ah cari sendiri they don't ya they don't meddle with my love life
um I nak lah tapi you know I feel like I've other things to settle think like love is like the last thing I would want to think about ah
and then you know from there on like more on like working on myself first lah then I can think of like things cause like I don't know like to have like sekarang to have love life like right now
ya ya ya ya that's why so um malas lah also like
mm cause like I had like previous like history with like bad breakups so it's like I really malas and tired want to like start again and to to meet someone new no I don't want
ya ya ya malas ah
I really don't want I just macam uh like I would
I would just like I like currently just enjoy that like the apa company of like my friends regardless of gender lah like whatever guy or girl just like enjoy it being friends mm but nothing beyond that I hope
do you have an aim like macam at like age apa umur berapa
I think everyone would think like macam they would get married like after their studies no like everything will be nicely like arranged but right now I'm like
cause like I think to just have degree is not enough so like I feel like I need to like um oh like what do I say how do I say this macam build up build myself up more in terms of education baru macam stable
to have like better jobs and everything kan to have like like a proper stable career then like then then can lah then boleh lah then can lah
dah dah lama kan tak berbual so macam it's really nice we should really jumpa soon you know
ah ah ah betul
so ini hari we will be talking about corona virus
err in Singapore and how so far kita kat sini at home and uh my family semua how we've been coping
err with all the jobs and all the um confinement semua kat rumah
how the family my family my mum and dad and my siblings and how I've been interacting dengan all my friends lah basically
bila we heard about all this um
corona virus thing err dulu back then I was somewhat employed lah
terus um when I heard about it at first err it didn't seem like such a big deal lah because um
people over there were quite err rilek they didn't care too much about it and it seemed that
err maybe it won't be as such a big issue lah tapi after that when I came back um
I was given a couple of mask tapi I thought like okay lah not really necessary but err eventually it turns out that
so that time bila we saw it on the news err my my girlfriend's uh auntie lah so dia kasi
uh because she's a bit paranoid more than usual so she decided to buy us only macam ten masks or so something like this
habis um ask us to use it err when we are at the airport sebab err who knows kan especially Indonesia agaknya maybe
not so safe lah and then err so I flew back I still wear the mask uh at first I thought macam too much ah actually macam maybe
kat station pakai mask habis um some of them err they there was no form of social distancing ah back then so there was no such advice but
mask ada quite a number of people they were wearing it lah and then um they decided to
eventually err make an announcement on and said that dia punya mask ini semua actually not mandatory lah at first then cakap only kalau macam you sick err you stay at home
err just jaga yourself lah there's no need to go out um and then slowly they start to quarantine and then slowly start to close the border and then
um slowly fall into the whole circuit breaker thing but in between there's a lot of doubt banyak orang orang macam didn't quite understand why we had to do certain things why the government asked to do certain things
maybe err eventually um it escalated to that level where it became a global pandemic lah habis Malaysia orang Malaysia affected orang Indonesia affected
at first Singapore was the first I remember we were actually the first ranked to macam got on the list lah
ah so at first we were the first habis
err in Euro and then slowly got to America and now sekarang kan kita in a state where um
employed habis sekarang macam like looking for job because uh
how about your experience macam mana you were coping with it
okay to be fair I don't think siapa siapa anyone lah was expecting this kind of situation to just suddenly appear
and I think a lot of businesses were impacted banyak um even home based business at some point was err affected kan
uh that was quite bad like the whole malay community like more or less macam slammed her
ya but err because of what she said a lot of people macam tak satisfied lah diorang macam
um kena pulau rabak rabak lah basically because of her statement she even
I think like most people what she should have done is even though sometimes you may think you may be right or niat dia the niat is there lah tapi macam
sometimes it's not about being right sometimes it's about being kind you know yes sure your intention is good macam nak tolong all these regulation issue ah
tapi sometimes it's about you you have to think about your consequences okay lah I mean of course the idea was not to be viral and not to get all this attention
tapi because of your words and especially now people are so uptight during this COVID situation is um what she should have done was
after she did it and of course nak return balik dia punya statement susah kan but at least macam just go out there and just apologize properly
tapi she chose to macam go online and just tell everyone all off that kind of thing is just crazy there's a lot of
and err some of them are funny macam the recent one where the Foodpanda rider just waving around
and I thought it was our good friend Hadi because okay to be fair sebab
habis he will macam ah be in that exact same attire and the exact same pants cuma bike is slightly different lah
like the first time I saw it macam this could be Hadi
it could really have been Hadi the way they dress dia punya seluar dengan dia punya helmet dia punya visor
uh unmarried guy twenty four year old guy but uh I think a lot of people macam does really
um macam it's an unsung hero kind of thing so people were quite uh positive feedback ah about the guy dia super extra ah
and um while it's widely recognised by society singaporeans at large tapi macam it's not something officially recognized by the government
so it's a good analogy to say macam this guy this mat just naik motor habis just riding and
he is not part of the actual celebration of they are not actually celebrating him it's just that dia macam very extra so he just happen to be there and he just
err the first tak salah Deliveroo was to start all this tapi in Singapore I don't know whether is Uber X or Grab or something lah
but what I really feel about food delivery is dia macam quite the game changer okay just think about this for a second ah about Grab drivers err not Grab drivers
people who are do food delivery all this kalau they really macam really work hard macam chiong all the way ah macam maybe eight hours chiong all the way macam Hadi for example kan
um they can earn about three thousand four thousand or even five thousand a month depending on macam mana they hit dia punya incentive or macam mana they hit dia punya
um hours or dia punya right timing ah because all these riders kan macam dorang dah experience for a very long time they will know a certain technique or certain tactic
how to do it right kedai mana um
prepare food quickly kedai mana prepare food very slow they know how to play the game lah basically so if you think about it they can potentially earn a white collar salary
and how skillful you are and how you deliver and how you strategize macam your delivery ah
to the upper income group because macam especially during circuit breaker period a lot of people and the delivery price isn't very cheap also
so every delivery macam ya macam every delivery is about ala carte you pay about four dollars uh or something ah per delivery so
chances are and even there's rich people macam err  beli kopi just one and then they they get the person to deliver and they they they they they
no much prerequisite lah maybe if you macam nak deliver naik motor kan then
ah kena pakai lesen you have to prove your lesen lah but if you are walking or you are riding a bicycle you don't need to
then think about this so I saw an interview err macam documentary lah don't know on Grab and how err some of the handicap people
um they managed to get jobs in Grab macam dulu um when they before Grab kan macam there's almost very little or no job they can do at all
so maybe some of them they did say macam if you are in a wheelchair maybe you can do admin job yes tapi ada orang macam down syndrome for example they can't really do much and
to be a person growing up with this kind of handicap you know macam is like a big macam beban
duduk kat rumah jadi beban jer puas hati macam you go out earn whatever little money you can and I saw this uh girl this Malay girl in a wheelchair lah
of how slow the electric chair also you you can't expect to deliver lah maybe satu hari deliver four or five items lah for example
so macam berdikari lah so instead of
the interface macam the training everything it allows you to do such a simple
err it it simplifies the task basically pergi sendiri pick up pergi sana drop off so it it it gives this
admin position or something macam kena interview tak tahu pass ke tak err your experience whatsoever like a normal job
you will get it you will get it most likely you will get it unless macam kalau too saturated or something lah there's too much driver around so I thought that was quite interesting as well
um the way that the food delivery has changed the landscape of earnings and how uh blue collar workers can potentially earn white collar workers punya salary
err I don't know if this is an actual word indiscriminatory indiscriminate macam
you you don't get err you don't get denied err okay selalunya the idea is when you do the employment kan err you cannot be judged based on your I don't know err race or
so macam for example delivery if you want to work you turn it on and then you work when you're done you're done
so err nak kerja kerja tak nak kerja sudah so when you're tired you get home
so that so called keep them motivated lah whereas macam delivery for motorbike delivery for example bicycle delivery you're not tied down
and you don't have that burden of oh hari ini kena buat sepuluh delivery for example no you earn how much you get that's yours
ah yes okay definitely lah so basically macam you go to the shop and then the food costs ten dollars err what you get
is um basically is through the app punya interface ah so as if the app interface says you earn seven dollars that seven dollars is yours lah
it's it's already a net amount dorang already cut off whatever that needs to be cut off err because sometimes
for example um whatever the food is dorang dah minus the food amount so err this delivery apps they alreally take a bit of your card
terus err whatever is shown in your phone macam you earn let's say six dollar forty five cents for example ah that's yours lah basically
you are okay let's say you are riding habis habis aleh-aleh dia hujan
oh tak ee I still got to go on I need to hit um ten deliveries today or uh I cannot pay my rental or whatsoever so
and how it is a good way for people macam let's say they have spare time ah macam let's say they work nine to five
habis malam macam they got nothing to do they just wanna okay tell you what let me just turn on my device and then err just make a few deliveries on the way home maybe
err ya so we were supposed to talk about corona virus tapi sekarang dah starting so much on delivery
okay question online exam what is stopping people from I mean to buku letak kat tepi
what sort of err security feature or identification yang dorang implement
kan risau
man I don't think I can I don't think I can go back to school already macam kirim salam ah
I mean who you would you get to the level where you think you are at the not say pinnacle lah but you think that you are macam everything dah okay
and you you think that you you can survive on that level of education project kerja just to survive on the salary from that job
um but I kudos to you lah memang is not easy to go back to school when I if you ask me to do it now I would probably won't don't it
or Facebook ada politics pe sekolah pun ada politics pe but one thing I okay so just to do a very very
in school walaupun you don't have to go everyday and you can plan your timetable whatever belajar but apparently you always have this
sinking feeling at the back of your head that macam there's exam coming up and you know you should be studying macam nak enjoy susah
tapi okay it it depends on people right so um
two major popular universities that they went to is either or eh so macam sekolah so basically you study throughout the whole year
whereas for the one that I went to basically err buat project
err it it it becomes like what uh eighty percent of your grade then twenty percent kat belakang exam
so that contributes to maybe twenty percent tapi kalau you have macam ada solid group you can work with
I don't know maybe your school is not like that maybe your school is exam based or but I am sure yours ada project kan
and you know where it unlocks you to you know as compared to macam all these budak budak they still have not have a taste of full life macam full working employment yet
that's why I think a lot of my friends yang um went to you uni SIM basically err university
night university lah so dia orang juggle between the job and basically if you do that you are throwing away your life ah there's no more social life basically
err pagi pagi daytime you go to work and then err malam then you go to school
and then you rinse and repeat basically you need to find time nak buat err nak buat group assignment nak study untuk exam at the same time in the daytime you are working
ya there's a lot of compromise err and you have to be willing to macam at least throw away one aspect of your life and typically is social lah because there's so much there's only so much sleep you can throw away
no lah at first to be honest ah at first bila all this thing happen kan macam um it's interesting err because is something novel
macam is not common apa dulu to to um communicate through okay maybe for you lah but for me it's I it's not common for me to do video calls
even with my own family tapi when this first thing happen and you will start communicating with your friends online
err at the comforts of your own home on your own bed anytime uh kerja err in your own room
it it seems fun at the beginning but afterward macam I think it depends on people also lah because ada orang ada orang boleh focus when they're at home
or the bed sleep lah take a nap during lunch time tu semua for some people it it it it's harder
you know because everything is there already and we just whereas kalau macam kat tempat kerja you've got to drag your ass and then
they switch into mode you know macam home mode err duduk kat rumah macam
more relaxed and then they are in that environment of relaxing cause for me when I'm at home I'm always feel like I'm in relaxing punya mode
and when I'm out I feel like I'm in out mode you know when your hair is macam all wax style and then
ah you know you're wearing clothes um and then you go out and eh you you just have that vibe macam I'm I'm ready to take on the work
you know macam when you're home you just want to relax lie on the bed watch video Netflix or whatever so when you you mix that kind of black and white and you get that greyish kind of area
no don't get me wrong I enjoy I enjoy the break I enjoy the break in um I enjoy the break in the regimen I enjoy the break in dia punya scheduling and stuff like that tapi
macam dekat rumah you can just eat macam you can snack and all that shit err but kalau kat luar uh macam you need to walk for it and uh I don't know
do you okay do you know that when you okay let's say when you err do delivery uh I think the so called delivery fee is about macam four dollars something like this kan
and you can actually see they have macam those package and the funny thing is if that month you just order two times you already make up for it because the the most basic package tak salah is err
no it's like a pass lah it's not really a promo if you say promo means it's apa macam limited edition kan tapi it's actually has been around for awhile
oh well people still deliver food a lot of people still macam still work from home pe banyak orang work from home pe sekarang lah
can work remotely they've been working remotely all this while sampai sekarang
fishy ah the Russian punya vaccine they didn't complete the trial the trial number three what
entah eh
entah lah
well kalau at the end of this year dapat pergi dapat pergi Malaysia pun I'm quite happy already to be honest
all the other countries at least dapat pergi somewhere within their own country kan so Malaysia even Malaysia or Indonesia
even though their borders are closed at least boleh pergi Penang dapat pergi um I don't know
for one of the islands Perhentian islands or something you know Sentosa nak pergi Sentosa Sentosa ada apa kau dah kenapa
if itu bukan itu bukan dia ini tau is not like dia pergi by himself dia pergi ikut err the diving punya tour thing
you still can go pulau hantu now actually
now that I got all this part time job at least macam my sleeping schedule is a bit better
tidak before that I was sleeping macam pukul lima pukul
empat it was ugh didn't like it is too late I forever young what you talking about man I'm you're only as old
tapi it's not like exclusive for
thirty more seconds kita kena clap eh lepas ini or
habis just stop jer
okay tak apa tak apa tak apa uh it just crossed one hour for me so I am gonna turn it off right now
okay boleh dengar
kalau tidak nanti it becomes distorted
okay okay then aku adjust
the boundary ah okay aku baru pasang
okay lah aku tak buat salah ah macam I I don't see
I wouldn't penalize myself uh just now ah maybe yesterday okay lah because yesterday aku macam kaku sikit because I didn't ride for very long right
to me I didn't want to say I experience I didn't want to lah but aku dah datang lambat semalam
semalam aku tak lambat so
then he started the face like macam
tahu macam oren penyet punya kan looking not happy like that so I was like okay lah I tell him I said okay I got experience like that uh uh kau experience kat mana aku cakap dulu I oh okay somebody go ask sampai back berapa then like uh
empat ke lima ah after second assessment
oh okay okay this one not for you go that one dia cakap macam tu
and obviously I I kept stalling like I um not midway but I kept stalling at that place yang you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or what I keep releasing too fast or something like that lah so dia macam when I'm moving then dia stall stall stall gitu
I don't see anything wrong with it lah macam they ask you to play from gear one to gear two right that's what I did
I think maybe it was probably twenty or twenty five or something like that aku bawa maybe thirty five ah thirty or thirty five ah it break dia punya speed ah
so the the problem was uh okay that that was yesterday so aku faham
I made less than less than ten rounds ah it was very fast I make less than ten rounds and then what happened was um dia cakap okay uh he put two people out
tak nak lah
fact ni cakap I didn't even stall today macam because I remembered doing this and I remembered I remembered riding like this the same way before and I pass
this time I failed he just said he just said you need more practice kepala otak dia lah need more practice at least you come and tell me macam maybe I did something wrong maybe aku terlalu laju or aku macam maybe I don't know maybe I didn't break before I change gear or something like that you know at least it's it's it's
I would learn from it and you know ini macam guessing game you know or not like oh I asked him I asked me just now I said oh actually what what went wrong like
wah tadi kau okay uh everything okay breaking okay tak macam semalam cause it it was the same fella ya the same instructor
oh takde apa-apa kau just need a a bit a bit a bit a of practice only just familiarise a bit more with the bike
no then inside my head I'm thinking kepala otak kau kau pun every prac kau pegang motor ke sama juga kan it's the same it's the same model what it's the same bike what what what is it that's so different
then I I I I got a bit irritated lah at that point of time then I just ah ya you know sudah lah
but tapi dia punya failure aku faham because I saw I saw what happened the first time she fell I didn't see the fall but she really tergolek you know rabak ah
because she okay you you try to visualise what where where I'm talking about ah okay basically when you ride on top they are four corners right she fell at the one you know where or not yang belakang yang that that wall
the sledge of wall no no E break is hujung sana ini yang dekat dengan admin punya side
time belok
dia turning ah ada cornering ah so
I was in front of her so aku bawa okay everything semua okay so I already made one round already
and then the instructor pun satu bodoh punya mangkuk she fell at the place where I really couldn't see
but I don't I also forgot about the mirror I didn't look at the mirror lah but I won't speeding I won't because that part memang you have to go down to get to that turn what
then aku belok sekali ada eh
because the other places where you turn ada orang it's quite open but that particular corner is is is ha memang seclude you cannot see anything there ah
ha then the instructor was like uh apa kau buat lagi alamak dia cakap macam tu kan then after that I I just I just don't I I don't get don't get don't get I just stop ah stop and wait
then she obviously her technique failed she gotta pick up the bike because because the bike was lying on the on the right and she was trying to pull to the left memang tak boleh lah of course cannot
so the instructor was like what what happened to you ah I told you how to do this and told you how to do that then why are you still making the same mistake again or whatever this and that ah so I guess takpe saya boleh tolong pasal dia jambu ke
and then ask her whether the she okay or not then she turned back and smile at she say eh sorry eh kalau in your way I say nevermind it's okay lah you just
just do your thing ah then the instructor go and tell her some more you know ha masa dah buang ni lagi
she likes to macam himpit to the left side
so no she probably got so close and after that she gabra because she was in the wrong lane after that so she skid and then she fall down but the funny thing was the bike was on my on the bike was on my lane
ha badan dia pula was on the other lane
but like I said that spot where she fell you cannot see from from before you literally need to reach that bend then you kau boleh kau boleh nampak dia
and then after that uh she was trying to start the bike ah kelakar cause when she fell kan I think the instructor went to kill switch so she didn't know
then she sat on the bike she tried to start but cannot start and then apa she said eh uh I think my motorbike spoiled dia cakap macam tu and then the instructor said your bike is not spoiled dia ingat spoiled dia try try try nothing and then she just got the clicking sound click clik clik one you cannot hear the engine starting ah
alamak how ni eh gini gini gini then he go there he said this one your switch your switch ha check your switch okay
then dia begin
takpe uh number one you go first I said but I thought you cannot overtake takpe takpe takpe I was number one she was number seven or nine I got number one ah so after that sampai habis
so I was just riding and riding and riding macam no problem lah to me literally like no problem I didn't even but there was one instructor was damn bloody annoying
because he the one yang pakai bandana I don't know you know or not to me he's damn bloody fucking annoying ah tall guy malay
muka dia macam mat sial sikit dia dia was on the he was on the he was at the bend yang depan lagi before you turn back into the the the admin area dia jatuh part sini kira square
macam ni kan admin area kat sini kan dia ada tempat sini si instructor lagi satu dia lepak sini the other side but when I was there and I wasn't speeding I wasn't because it
makes sense or not if you're not speeding or if you you already drop your speed kau nak brake buat apa you're already breaking already what I put on on on gear two and I I don't need to break and I don't need to clutch in nothing so I was just the bend and it wasn't
macam you can hear the engine sounds vroom it's just nice ah turn and like salah salah kau kena brake lagi kau kena brake lagi brake brake sebelum kau down gear brake kau nak brake apa lah siol so
at that point of time the more he talk the more aku peng ah but I guess no he wasn't he was he like he was the one with three tudung girls in his class
tapi dia orang baru nak keluar ah so
aku rasa dia nak malukan aku ke apa ah just want to start one again ya I guess normal leh you know whatever lah eh
for me lah as far as I'm concerned nothing went wrong dia suruh aku main one two one two one two three aku one two three one two four and back round to one okay no problem
ha plank plank quite senang what
but I still remember two B in seven seconds tak salah aku is fast lah let me class to you have to go thanks again eh
ya I saw I saw it uh tak salah aku nampak dekat mana eh
you don't upgrade now lah dol you you get your two A bike whatever super four ke three ten ke something like that okay you ride that bike for as long as you can and then once kau dah
confident once kau rasa macam you know your your your balls are big you dare to take a bigger bike ha that is five six years later you you change ah you don't have to macam oh I get class two sekarang juga aku nak tukar ha
but ya um then then then they are super fours in exactly the same look at the bike the body the lampu
four bottles mampus mampus
ya lah because you got to change it frequently apa
have what ah three ten is is pendek what
but you can lower the expansion you the zontes three ten can lower down the expansion yes but zontes three ten cantik sia
the yang one ninety
the the the the apa the capacity capacity I think is
dia punya tank eh dia punya tank is I think fifteen or sixteen litres
ya but the thing is a zontes kalau let's say misal kata if I were to use the bike in another country if I go to another country and if that bike mampus ke apa ke kat sana bro I'm dead sia
that's why you never go jauh-jauh I mean you went to malacca once right
ya lah you common bike boleh ah you you use all this kind of funny sounding bike even continental yang tak kira asia tak popular punya mampus kalau motor kau mati
oh kira macam gitu siala
habis ah
malaysia boleh
but imagine if you're like stuck in I don't know negeri sembilan ke apa
kena jaga ah
aiyo kena bully ah
but if you tolak means kena bawa perlahan ah very slow ah
sticky situation macam mana
no but kau boleh brake juga apa
dulu punya trend eagle apa ha
wobbly ah lepas tu jatuh ah
kira dia orang semua members ah
time tu your father belum kahwin ah
masih bujang lapuk ah
tapi it's just dangerous sia
oh ya ya ya I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard belum lagi after
speaking of of of of this part tadi um
there was this guy I don't know I got tell you or not tadi ada satu he was on the mini circuit ah
a'ah sia basically the bike is is basically the the the wall like this but he went up and then he was still he was still turning bro on the bike whack everything first kena the plastic barrier after that ah already dah ada bunyi like gitu broom gitu then after that
then he continue moving bro so the wall was here and then his bike was there the wall his his bike was rabak sial
aku tak tahu but after that he stop kaki dia sakit
here he cannot climb between after when he when he so called fell the bike was lying on him he bike was lying on him and he was sandwiched between the bike and the wall then dia macam I cannot ah I cannot
aku macam alamak
then the instructor the instructor just like eh nevermind you all continue continue macam tak apa-apa gitu nevermind nevermind you all continue and then he go he he came out lah to pull the bike one side then ask him you okay or not but I think after that he didn't didn't continue
I do not know but I I know dia cakap pasal after that's he walk he was limping
sakit juga siol sakit juga
but I really do not know no young ah maybe hazriq punya size ah
dia macam scooter sia

eh apa apa kau nak aku ungkit apa jadi
okay lah cause I think it was a joke also cause she was sick what at that time then ah I was I think I was at home or rumah nenek aku abeh aku tengah baring after lunch this one was before our our training start then I saw the message then aku macam eh it can't be ah it can't be a'ah I think we were practising for ya
hais aku aku affected
dia macam malas ah so macam too many things happening so macam malas
eh kurang ajar diam
aku bangun pagi dah cukup bagus eh

no I was thinking about yang two N E one yang
so that was fire ah aku tak pernah tahu pun title dia
yang jessie tu eh
tapi ada jimin ah
entah lah sis
I don't care terbaik jer
ya ah tadi pagi aku baru baca pasal dia seh
entah aku tengah tengok video apa entah then like it's just in my suggestion
ah yang big bang top
post about her like sebab dia tak reply the last message hara send him which was a birthday wish
itu jer
ah no no no no no hara like message top on his birthday tapi top I think busy or something then so he didn't reply her
what song I think davichi aku tak tahu
yang dia duo kan
eh kau tahu tadi kan
takde tadi pagi aku try bangun then aku nak sarapan ah
abeh then lepas sarapan aku buka YouTube
abeh the first thing yang kau tahu from YouTube YouTube punya wah macam living room nya YouTube ah
ah macam macam if you connect your YouTube to your living room's
what the hell okay whatever then the first thing pop up kan is this ah apa eh
you know jin ifrit kan
ah the the the jin yang play with fire okay that sounds funny but
okay so technically we have a lot of jin kan it's a
but ya okay so kan but aku tengok video dia macam kelakar a bit lah but then
err okay aku skip to first part eh and then when so he he took this err a pair of shoes
cause this house was I don't know macam terbakar last time so ada ashes and there was something and then
so maybe the owner ada perempuan and ada a pair of shoes so this person this blogger took that pair of shoes and then put in front of the door
rumah rumah cina I guess
abeh uh huh
the the shoes is the direction is towards a door okay in front of the door so kira the pointy part of the shoes is towards the door lah kan facing the door
then so he go down you know just checking out buat kelakar cause he was scared so he sing along lah
tak handsome ah
mana ada kucing okay lah maybe maybe for us it's like ah he must have edited that lah ha
ya tu kau boleh cakap macam oo who's the one who change the direction okay so so he continued exploring the house
and then err apa
ya cause memang nampak terbakar
tak tahu ah eh
oh okay and then bila macam dia masuk
I think masuk bathroom or kitchen ah I forgot
and then suddenly like tempat tu very panas you know then dia punya tahap panas until there's a smoke come out of nowhere
dia punya fire spark and then tiba-tiba spread all the way dekat lantai so pasal kau human kan kau akan lari apa and then his live was being cut off oh he was doing live ah actually YouTube live
mm ah so he went out the house or room I don't know then dia try to put off the fire back
tak dapat semua ah only sixty percent
yang kat lantai lantai dia uh hilang kan
then bila dia
he saw the thing on fire no the room suddenly sampai
ya you remember that I said the object was like ada smoke coming out
no cause it was during circuit breaker apa
circuit breaker then ramai orang work from home so I was alone in the lab no interns no what
your tempat tinggal
dekat ah satu bus jer kot
apa tu naik one six eight jer
no dia naik one six eight then dia turun dekat jalan kayu kan
mana tahu so it's like a a palm thing sized eh
he kerja malam
kalau aku aku dah keluar seh
kurang ajar seh orang macam gitu ee
tak mahu hidup please
orang tengah kesusahan kau tak tolong eh
kurang ajar sia
today malam ah
is for orang yang buat korban kan not us
perempuan I'm not sure usually lelaki
I mean kalau kau baligh I guess I don't know
kau import
I think they will but restricted takde viewers viewers eh whatever ah ah ah ya ya
go masjid doesn't mean I always do korban what you think I'm that rich ah
no lah aiyo I don't even eat kambing
no ah only eat biryani and tulang merah
that's the only kambing that I eat
actually pada aku tak ah it depends on how you cook actually
no that's why aku very selective with like orang masak kambing kan aku tengok reviews dulu
err so far aku rasa biryani masjid jer yang sedap
you know yang yang kat sekolah kita yes tu from one of the mosques ah I don't know
it's like for four people to eat it in fact sikit jer cause they say girls always waste food
I mean don't blame us ah we finished it clean seh kita minta dua tiga kali
tu pasal seh
eh you are still growing takpe lah
I don't know korang kira the the high ah
tapi kau pernah pakai yang very tall what
ah yang penting aku tak kan
aku pernah pakai flats uh fifty which is what five no wait to
so perempuan eh
uh eh five tinggi tau
kau pernah pakai that time
siapa eh siapa nama dia fatin fatin nadirah
ah tu semua takde
no lah cause sec one aku tahu
then semua orang macam tak nak join dorang punya group so thirteen me cause I was unhappy with mumtaz then I asked my friends cause they were closer with me actually
then I kept eh you all want to join me kita book kita sewa bus then macam okay okay ah okay lor
aku ingat lah kau ni sec one sec one sec one aku ingat
no they were with dorang ah
ya I mean you keep blaming when like kita orang not everyone you know there's only like a group of people yang cari pasal dengan kau
actually understandable ah cause we were talking about class there what tak nak kawan macam
ah macam tersisih gitu
okay dah eh dah habis eh
but kena force take everything back
I don't want to take private okay aku tak nak stereotype ah but you look at the people who take private O level
tebalkan muka ah
and apparently I I was the only one yang retake
the rest all go out cause previous batches right they do have seniors coming back just to take O level but then now I don't know everyone like very ego don't want to come back malu I guess so ya lah tapi ustazah siapa masniah tak salah
ah dia kata dengan aku apa kalau awak nak retake awak kena ambil fully dengan arab arab sekali semua aku macam eh serious ah ustazah
aku ah aku dah penat aku nak O level jer tau
previous seniors ah like they retake tapi they are exempted from
which what I thought it would be cause kakak aku macam gitu
tapi aku kena ambil everything then aku bingit siol
ah kakak aku retake
oh siap eh
jap eh
sebab dia macam ada good and bad tau if like your your current self go back to the old times like ada good and bad
oh my god don't forget her benci though
aiya I still cannot forget you know aku tengah copying notes down and she was talking I don't know about what uh shakespeare
aku tak ingat ah but
kelakar gila ah sebab I my meja is the only one that is extended out so literally I'm in the middle of nowhere and like she's doing it in front of me I was like
yo how how does it feel when you just broke up and then like eh kau tahu dia macam gini kat aku kat aku macam ya allah
sec two sec three ah but like after dia ni pe
kata-kata dia macam he was very depressed after breaking up with me like bullshit lah
like clearly everyone the whole school is talking about you you know like eh sudah lah I don't have time for all of you
eh tak cause okay cause my relationship was low-key relationship kan of course ah I don't want to expelled what
no maksud aku at that moment
that's different maksud aku low-key is like
ya okay maksud aku low-key kan that time was like cikgu-cikgu tak tahu part ni tak keluar tak heboh-heboh
so actually tak ramai orang tahu that I was in a relationship with him we study ah whenever we sit in the circle you know ah our our own things sit in circle then talk about then like eh amin like shafwa is it amin like shafwa right eh but I know shafwa like amin ah they always go out together aku dah macam
camne nak cakap eh aku jer asyik put in effort ah for me lah that's what I see ah don't know about him maybe he said like I put in effort too then macam ya lah
sebab tu buat aku penat ah
so okay pada aku really shafwa is just the reason
kau world ah
oh just like that guy siapa eh
ya at that time kau pun macam ah
was it the apa
yang is guy
pengotor seh
macam mana dia nak lupakan kau the girl that was dragged
eh aku nak takoyaki nya where to get ah oh my god so tempted
one satu satu for six dollars
berapa the twenty four dollars plus kan
oo tu aku one seating habis kan
eh jangan ah macam ni tak baik seh
eh aku nak try ni ah yang apa Boms and Buns eh
ya ya ya it's just few shops away from Chulop jer sebab dorang tak dapat beli shop tepi
tu lah aku tengah fikir
eh lepas kita pergi Boms and Buns we can go Spize makan wah aku dah lama tak pergi jalan
when was that bro that's not in bedok actually dekat somewhere else
it's dekat ah lain punya branch eh not bedok
I mean same company ah but different cook what bodoh
I never tadi aku makan ayam masak merah seh like I only eat a little
okay but then kan aku ingatkan aku makan sikit cause I want to buy that that chicken kan but then when
okay wait I finish I wash all my plates already then I open foodpanda just now ah I was I was looking at GrabFood and foodpanda tu then like whoa eighteen dollars
ah ya ya ya you can't deny that it's pedas
entah eh
maybe the chili dah absorb or something no
apa the noodle
all right okay jadi yang abang guide to grabfood ni
tahu tahu tahu tahu and I was like oh my god I've never seen tampines mall look like that kind of serious macam like
ni waktu bila like april eh april may
oh abang grabfood
damn boleh tahan juga ah oh my goodness
so like dia tak not to worry lah
tak layan lah dia biarkan jer
so kau habis kau cakap apa
okay kot
wah fan service fan service habis
oh macam ni zan itu budak ini
yikes oh but he dia deliver like which area
oh dekat ah
his route oh okay tempat lepak literally
okay tahu tahu tahu
tahu tahu I know that one
ah tu lah
too and and and then they dia orang like buat videos yang can make you pause for a while and like oh I'll double tap that
entah aku tak tahu but we'll find out soon
so like um like you're not you know that that meme yang the person is like um like they're not happy they are annoyed
ya so that's what it means so if you see maknanya kiss kiss my teeth
like once you respond habis that's it mm
I do it you know I've got come my adik I do it at nasha when I ask her to like get me something
I am a minah at heart
it's six o'clock that's it I tutup my laptop I roll over to my bed and I buka tiktok
and she was like you tak nak makan eh and I was like oh right dinner I totally forgot
today I learn so macam like you know people can watch the videos very easily they can say oh that it's from this app called tiktok and at first it's like you know at first I I thought it was like the musically yang bodoh punya
ya betul betul betul
yes yes and we know that musically dengan vine tu semua budak kecil
yes like the budak mana from clementi tengah buat dancing
eh how long have you been going for the uh apa afro ah afro class
so for physical classes macam dia orang kasih berapa orang datang
stamina dah turun
rentak and all
I guess I guess that's the stereotype lah kalau macam malay dance instructor confirm zumba
you lose our pintu tak ada lah
then pakai lagu-lagu seventeen seventeen is known for their very sharp um dances
it's ayam juga
ah it's okay sis dah malam kan dah pukul sembilan fifty fifty
oh my god aku ingat kau dah ada dua phone ni I'm a businesswoman ke
how okay in the first place macam mana kau nak focus I I'm I just
you know what I mean ya to each it's own I trust you I know like if you say suara sedap mesti suara sedap kan
ha tu lah I thought that you know it should be exclusive if you're like into japanese stuff anime you probably won't go the other way
um it's more slice of life I guess um so I guess I prefer that kind rather than macam like actually the things I remember watching
who is basically a psychic then and he has like extraordinary superpowers so macam for him right he wears his like pink antennas on his head
so apparently that helps to curb his powers kalau dia tak pakai kan nanti dia bangun pagi kan terus dia punya rumah dah habis dah
so like he needs to so okay so his power is like literally anything that he touches expected to stone or like or if if someone say it's can you like urut me like he would urut and then after that you will just your body whole body just like just becomes a ball because he just his power is just too strong or he kicks someone okay so there's was this one scene
it's so merepek but it's so good it's so kelakar gila like if you have the time then give it like one episode I love it so much like during lunch breaks
okay yes yes I skip the intro that's what I do you have to skip the intro so like just one hour straight I'll just watch ah saiki it was so good and the thing is I think there's like a couple of seasons I rasa belum habis
like I've started two three weeks ago I rasa belum habis
I watch I watch during lunchtime I watch during dinner time tak habis-habis tau I'm like bila ni
aku tak tahu ada berapa season berapa banyak episode I'm still with season two tau season freaking two
oh yang total aku tak tahu aku belum I don't even know how many seasons there are sorry
ya it's like to it's she's own I guess I prefer that lah cause I guess I can relate to it more macam shonen is like a little bit more difficult for me cause you have to
even this one tak masuk akal pun at least I I can relate
I I actually um because I brought home najhah's punya um haikyu jacket and
yes she's she's tall tall is one thing she's also like quite berisi juga like she's not stick thin
plus it's like her favourite show so I tak nak hampakan lah
she's on freaking Reddit for like anime I was just like oh my goodness you really cannot like if you have any questions like you can you go ask me at least I can ask kak zan and kak najhah you jangan macam gini eh
some how are some people are just really ridiculous tau merepek gila tau dia punya perangai and then after awhile I realized that for
ha tu lah
she was telling me also like it's okay if you can't bring me I'll just find online I was like eh sixteen where you want to find online macam mana cannot because it's sixteen you cannot watch she's like I'll find the thirteen one
jesse mccartney no lah that's a singer merepek jer sampai jer kutuk aku bukan
tu lah uh tak boleh haram
ah biasa okay lah bagus lah apa apa lah shah
ah tu lah oh my god that is is so true like we were big kids already
like how they start with marriages like how they are very like you know the girls always like tunduk to the husband
you should just have said tiga so
kau datang dari drama mana ni
recently I watched because it came out on netflix I watched nur
it's so basically okay the is quite interesting okay so it's about this um new ustaz baru graduate from syria or something like worst of the countries
who has his own um tahfiz school and his own masjid
and then one day while he was giving the ceramah subuh thank god he he
kat masjid dia orang and then he received like some questions of people um and it's really weird because
ha dia orang Q&A tak pernah dengar kan
ada Q&A session uh the questions were
ya serious curious cat islamic version masjid version
bila keluar masjid then dia nampak this kelibat perempuan yang sedang menulis on a white piece of paper
he was macam ya like wow
so but like more in depth lah so like for him like want to provoking macam hati dia macam dup dup
uh kalau solat saya kentut bila rakaat ni
everywhere like dia punya dekat jalan and they met and they dated
ya because she didn't want to be found out so she tergesa-gesa but the she just
and she suddenly like not suddenly she seems like a very patient person but it's tak masuk akal the level of patients and the
my favourite like most ridiculous malay show that I watched was cinta si wedding planner
okay not twenty four seven but she was like full time when she's outside so there'll be like bedroom scenes okay not bedroom bedroom but she's chilling and then kat rumah and she's about to sleep and she's wearing tudung
or she's sleeping in her tudung
or like maybe not the not the you know the nenek-nenek kind
ha tu lah
this is my baju sekolah ah
esok no lah I just do whatever I have to do
kerja lah but no need to go out what
apa ah
mm the kucing can look after themselves
okay okay start balik ah
trick dia orang punya mind
kurang ajar sia then if I go to that shop then I read their mind oh this one
with just a click a a flip apa
with petik jari ah
ya lah petik jari
isn't isn't snap finger petik jari no meh
eh abeh kalau
tapi kalau smelly as fuck bau macam tong sampah you can be near that person meh you can see from far only what what's the point then
I thought that's why you're regretting it then you benci
if ada I want ah
yang for the cat ones ah
play with the cats yang sakit-sakit punya then I feel so bad for them now I want to bring them home sia
dah lah nak ambil kucing punya lah susah
but tu ada dua
no unless dia name it socks
in case they will attempt to jump on me again sakit tau tak
then when I open my eyes at least I can see one shadow dekat atas
ya I know lah but tu sebab
anak dia kena bunuh ah
then treat it like the three cats eh three cats pula the three cans you donate to the
but semalam you tried tried to feed them the chicken
or or you try not to mix nanti pukul empat
they will obviously not eat the chicken mousse apa
cuma they cerewet only but they still eat it
you change buttercup's foods sebab dia punya tahi apa
uh atuk dia punya birthday what
alah biar lah dia orang nak mate ke nak apa
jadi got more cute kittens
apa sia merepek ah
out of your embrace eh blossom sini lah
apa sia

eh mana buttercup
if you have to jampi orang for one reason what would it be
itu last resort
no like ya jampi maybe that person
but you cannot lawan them what
so you jampi them and get back
I will only jampi
kan nenek cakap yang
yang our dad's side use all these also
mana tau dia punya
requirement is like kena male female male female I don't know they have weird
no why why like that weekdays lima hari sia weekend dua hari jer
tanya jer tak boleh ke
of course these are all syirik but
then semua kena kacau
ya like kena tarik kaki then like
mak kau terkejut aku I also don't know sia
then they ask me eh kau pakai barang eh then I was like
pakai barang apa sia
high likely kau yang patut kena kacau asal kita orang pula yang kena
kau tak kena langsung and the thing is while while we were there there's like um
then the rest was just standing around then dia dekat atas like
over over me and my friend so I was like they said itu
tu benda kau punya then I was like
we went satu dua tiga empat uh five of us right
then then they saw ah they saw kakak they saw itu they saw ini
that his mum lah kan nenek bising cakap apa
keep on suruh-suruh
apa sia ni like eh if I got a husband
like keep on asking me to buat tu buat ni buat tu buat ni and he's just sitting there and smoking like I will fucking slap his face with a broom sia and I ask for a divorce
should we go to ustaz and ask
not really salah bawa lah
tu ustaz tu pula nanti kita jadi isteri nombor sembilan dengan sepuluh tak nak ah
sial ah tak nak ah
pandai-pandai tinggi nak mampus uh uh
uh ah yes ah why would I be sad I was just sad for a moment cause like eh asal aku nak pergi jadi nombor sebelas eh
sekali the wife jealous of my beauty
then then ni number eleven ni tak boleh kasi poison ke apa
nanti kasi mee rebus
eh bini
ah that's where my question just now come if you have only one jampi what would you do mana tau the wife like that hmm
eh your pelindung also cannot lindung pergi mati
tak baik sia imagine if your husband is outside the door and he heard you
see your pelindung cannot do anything
berapa ah
no but it's so weird that since we don't know our cousins on papa punya side
you never know I'll be like a lipas you know like can't kill me
no china people bela me man
boleh chicken
I have then then if they see eh tak lawa sia nak kena pakai more makeup mm I I I really like
that's why I say greatest masterpiece that's why nanti clinic dia naik nama tau
then nanti people start sending barang lagi sebab dah lawa
then they send like endorsement hantar barang apa tu tak ke
places to grab maybe what apa

apa then the the other two was like oh can we have more water then after I serve water then they say oh this
and apa ah dia cakap that mat salleh was saying like oh it wakes up the japanese man
then I was like mm part mana sambal dengan japanese eh
it's good you know like the nanny suara dia macam janice yang from friends
that voice dia buat-buat jer
when I read books they say oh her aura change then I was like macam mana sia aura boleh tukar then
nasal yang hidung punya voice
hais I need to eh ada surgery tak untuk buat lebih tinggi
then six months is it or one year yang tak boleh jalan
tangga I know I know
got a few people will say like you know I feel like I want to squeeze you then put inside my pocket I was like apa sia aku kecil gila apa sia dia orang nak buat gini
pakai heels pun like
we were googling on uh how to grow taller then ada they got sell some pills and stuff but then they say
lajukan your hormones or something like that
I actually like lupa
I lupa nak reply her
okay I'm going to reply her after I makan
then like after I makan I was like
tapi like I don't want then I felt like
so semalam like
I told my mum and my kakak was like
to like clean like cause apa nama dia err yesterday I spent the whole day shifting
my almari from my room to my guest room
then I was doing it myself I had to take out all the buku-buku
and then I shifted all the I I I simpan the book balik
and then what happened to the one keluar you know what time we keluar or not we went out like
so we only went into spotlight and I told you about the patterns that I wanted to beli right
I went to spotlight sebab I want to find
for the inside layer for my mask cause I want to jahit for my
which tak habis-habis
ya so I was trying to find a breathable kain
main thing that I wanted to cari was the
like find the kain
turns out it was like dekat dalam
an almari
tadi tadi while while bathing I was
cik saya nak order
nak order suji boleh
tapi usually like people sell suji that
as I was saying tadi
I was trying to think macam like
err when is a good time for us to record lah cause macam
at five masih very very very memekak
crowded here and because that time masa masa we shot at kim punya place
yang we went to jewel eh I think
like all my close friends I only like keluar with the for like
like satu bulan eh no dua bulan sekali kind of thing you know
or like tiga bulan sekali
ah ya ya ya apa
give it a listen nanti lepas ni
I think the korean industry is kind of like macam
apa nama dia macam mana nak cakap eh
and it's damn big it's like besar gila and
real lah macam
pakai yang the one that I told you about hari tu that it karat
four hundred okay so it's four hundred plus for two specs kan sebab it's like one for one
um when I was buying it I was like thinking kenapa dia punya
kenapa orang nak kena ada promotion for specs one for one like who would buy
oh it's a good deal cause like macam
mum and my kakak ah
patutlah dia jual one for one
sebab dia punya specs tak guna
then I was like lepas tu dia cakap eh cause like
your degree naik or something right
is it just tak masuk akal to me
then my kakak cause my kakak was telling me ah that um celebrities who
share that dia orang beli their glasses from owndays like they keep on macam promoting owndays that means like
you can try off the shelves kind of thing and I guess that's why macam a lot of
specs shop is dekat dalam the display then you have to like engage the
is on display everything at macam the racks then you just take and tak payah
like the the shop that I went to dia
dia dia dia dia I sound like I'm singing oh my god
while waiting for them to fix my kakak punya glasses
like berani gila
don't really show they don't really report the exact number is because macam
they have to let the migrant workers work sebab of the number of attempted suicide cases are rising
talking about apa nama dia um
fight for women's right and all that stuff and then I masuk then I was like what is all these two faced people
I feel like writing and radio is very two faced macam
macam that
but then you only do a little like sikit
but like playing with stocks are like macam gambling ah
naik or turun
my nenek sheryl was sharing with me ah that like
so my mind is literally macam peanut
macam there's there's there's there's a lot of like useful content and some merepek content
different tiktoks everyday kan macam like it like within
nanti it will refresh like and then like you will get like a whole new set of like other stuff
and stuff like that and and like to reach out err to a bigger audience but macam
like I masuk also to tengok what people
no I masuk to tengok like people send me
stuff and then I'll be there for like half an hour and then that's all like I I can only like I used to be able to macam
and when guys do that is like tak ada perempuan lain ke
like as in macam
like to me right it's like tak tahu malu ke like you already like cling onto like someone
try everyone else macam
macam like common ya
they are macam
suruh dia kahwin chef ah
there's a lot of like male chefs as compared to female chefs so kalau dia nak kahwin kahwinlah dengan
even if they don't have like long term macam five years or ten years if it's if that's too long for them I feel macam
they should have at least like a one year plan kalau tak macam
what you menganggur
oh I don't know what to do with my life I will think about it oh serahkan pada like allah and that kind of things then I'm like
where's your usaha man like you can't just like sit down and expect things to fall down in front of you like you have to work for it
habis nanti like if if you say that
if you tegur them about it right nanti dia orang macam
the first time apa ah
who was like cause like his his profile he put there macam
I was like oh he is one eight one that's tall then I was like oo I'm going to talk to him sebab dia tinggi and then like I can finally wear heels if I date him
like atas sikit
macam like a higher angle you know
you know my dock marts punya sandals
so it makes me taller sikit ah then tadi I was walking beside my mum
then jalan jalan jalan then I was like
then she was like because if you do that nanti you will imagine how aryan will see me

I mean at the end of day I mean ah how how much netflix can you watch right within a day I mean aku tengok netflix one one hour drama pun dah aku dah macam lethargic gila like alone like to be staying I mean right now I'm staying home lah because because of this the whole entire err situation
I mean K mine was quite interesting I mean err as you know aku kan buat caregiving job kan to my friend so err I mean yesterday I was just resting I mean the day before so of course err
um when it comes to have to my friend need um what I do normally is I go over to his place um I will like um prep him lah and keep him proper and like aku mandikan dia
uh and then dia nak berak and everything so aku dia and everything then aku nak kena siapkan dia so everything took like one hour plus and then after that
err we were waiting for transport because kawan dia nak kena hantar tau hantar dia so we were like one hour late for the appointment so we're supposed to be there by three
but we only managed to get the transport by like three forty five lah almost four lah so lambat lambat lambat gila so by the time we reached err the hospital
err hospital tu somewhere around dekat err in the east
so it was almost four so by the time kita masuk then the the therapists were saying like err one hour lambat and everything lah last standard procedure lah huh but they would just do their best lah because of this COVID nineteen kan
so okay lah I mean it it then after that aku hantar dia balik and then lepas tu bila aku hantar dia balik after that there was guest that came in so the guest happens to be err like err dia punya adik punya wife punya parents
so of course aku nak kena siapkan lah I had to like wipe him err tukar baju dia tukar t-shirt dia and everything so I had to like prep him and then he was dia pun nak makan
dia dah makan err then the the parents of err dia punya err apa tu adik dia punya wife masuk tau into the room
and then it was like so awkward ke tu orang tua aku tak tahu kenapa dengan orang tua but bila dia like when they entered the room aku dah tahu okay this is going to be a very sombre sedih atmosphere
it's kind of betul gang ah they were talking to my friend and then they started to cry aku dah macam ya alah aku cakap no don't cry and then after that the one thing that made me even macam tersentuh sikit lah bila bunyi apa tu
your phone ah kacau jer your phone oh your alarm okay tak apa tak apa so apa tu semantic noise so ah so okay back to my story so lepas tu ah then the the mother lah the mother said to me lah ah nama anak nasri ya
then like mm a'ah cik nama saya nasri dah okay I was feeding my friend right so after that the mum was like nak nak tahu kan anak suap anak suap err err kawan ni anak dapat pahala aku dah macam aku tak tahu apa nak buat do not know how to continue the convo
ya ya ya ya ya and then aku dah macam
ya ya it's true it's true and then aku macam and then err lepas tu err then the mother was like saying err um saya jaga err suami saya dia masuk hospital enam kali then I'm like eh kamu bual err personal story pula kat aku aku dah macam macam mana nak react ah so aku macam then I I try my best
a'ah I tried my best to stay composed lah then after that err aku pun dah macam alamak aku tak boleh kalau orang tua dah start nangis then they started to cry aku dah tak boleh aku dah macam no no no no this this cannot dia they they the both the husband and wife started to cry while talking to my friend then
I almost I am macam tak boleh I cannot embed in this kind of situation because if I'm in this kind of situation I would end up macam tersentuh ah and then automatically my air mata will mengalir you know so I was like then I was like quickly err err apa tu kasih suap then after that I just say uh
cik takpe cik saya nak kena keluar sekejap lah so I went out of the room lah then when I went out the room
and then kau tahu apa you know my mum's friend um
she cannot enter the room you know of my friend ya kiranya my my friend punya mum
mother lah kirakan ah tak boleh masuk you know inside the room because you see ah
because yang sakit tu anak dia tau so bila so she is and then she's also sakit so when she will feel sedih you know she told me personally you know like
she she try not to enter into the room because when she see her son in that condition dia akan nangis
ah yes yes yes that like she feel like macam anak dia akan pergi dulu you know so there are moments where when I come over to the place
and then aku dekat dapur and then the mum would would like tell me lah like like you know err the mum will cry you know in front of me and then the mum will say err
tu lah err takde orang lah yang dia kesian you know aku punya kawan macam dia kan sekarang pun yang jaga dia it's like the father and the maid apa the maid is actually supposed to be doing the house chore and on top of that help out mum you know
but but she has an additional job of taking care of my friend lah so macam so sometimes bila dia tak mampu to help out my friends she has to help out the mother first apa because the mother is the priority first apa
so you know at times kau orang kunyit dia mulut dia pun aku kenal pun macam minta minta minta nyawa err dia pun sometimes will say you know like err
puas hati masukkan err dalam ni lah rumah orang-orang tua atau rumah orang sakit
can you imagine saying that to your to your you know your mother when your mother listens to that you know how how broken she is when when you you talk like that but but dia yang sakit dia tak fikir perasaan mak dia so that's why the mother there are a couple of times already ah and then the mother the mother say lah macam
and then like the dad also around seventy plus also so they are like macam golongan really yang orang tua lah
so sometimes bila mak dia nangis aku pun tak tahu macam mana nak react with aku dah macam huh macam mana nak what am I going to do am I gonna do I need to bring a tissue paper or what and then I just like macam err takpe lah cik sabar lah cik cik tahan jer lah
but even the the mum also say lah macam the mum somehow I can feel like the mum macam somehow appreciate aku lah macam akan cakap apa like what you tell me like err
an outsider wouldn't do this to to this extend to help a person but the mum macam
the mum really appreciate aku ah the mum macam sometimes I think the mum dia tersentuh lah and always look look look
look out on whenever I come come over and everything sampai dia pun nak masakkan nasi rawon ah tak silap
because they dia dia orang orang boyan I think boyan ke jawa I think err jawa jawa sorry dia orang orang jawa
the parents are orang jawa so so so nasi rawon is like a big thing lah so I didn't come on the day she masak cause I was just too tired then I told my my my friend lah like macam eh aku tak dapat datang ah tolong kau hari ini sebab aku penat
so the then the mum said ah tu lah cik masak ah hari tu tapi tu lah err anak tak nas nas tak tak dapat datang I'm like sorry lah cik K I mean
honestly aku cakap dengan kau
aku kan nak balik kan in in september and october you know whenever I tell that to my friend
uh dia automatically dia akan sedih so aku dah macam tak tahu macam mana aku nak react then he he say to me lah like hey can you do macam online from here then I'm like huh how am I supposed to do online and then I mean half half of me macam kalau boleh nak tolong dia
I mean after so many years of just macam you know you know that what I mean the situation of of what you are right now macam you know feeling very lost I mean I was there last time macam kita have that conversation with beberly kan
ah yang kat mcdonald's err like I was very very lost when I was like what umur aku twenty two all the way to twenty seven can you imagine I was lost for almost five years
so so that's why I was like telling myself err when when comes to to my friend lah ya aku tak boleh tolong dia all the way but I can help him out to this extent because I tell him personally like
you know with this COVID situation it will be very hard for me to ulang balik come back because of the whole swab test err quarantine and everything I mean at the end of the day dia dia pun nak kena redha and I aku pun cakap dengan dia lah macam
you know the fact that you are somebody there are a lot of people who come to your aid when you when you need help because you think about it is just macam
he always dia dia selalu ingat yang
yang aku jer seorang yang boleh tolong dia padahal orang lain pun boleh tolong dia
then aku sudah cakap aku aku aku cakap dengan dia lah macam kenapa tak nak panggil aku punya cousin setakat cousin aku dengan kau lama apa enam tahun apa
tapi dia dia macam tak lah macam macam err then dia cakap lah yang cousin aku tak take initiative and everything
mum betul betul betul
memang membastard rabak punya
ya I mean I don't know lah err I mean err if I if I want to share you personally then kau macam
err he even ni tau that he gave a certain amount of money to me tau
and the amount is one K with dia kasih aku dia jadi macam sedekah kat aku dia cakap eh err you take lah this money to pay for your semester fees as alhamdulillah but at the end of the day at the same time aku rasa macam
kau tahu macam you are tied down to something that's why aku kalau boleh tak nak macam
I don't want to accept the money lah you know honestly in all honesty I don't want to accept the money but because um dia dah ada ni ah you know sometimes orang sakit bila dia niat kau nak kena tunaikan dah niat kan
so aku just accept graciously lah and aku and I I I feels that money to pay for my err semester fees err for my err semester lepas
ah ya it feels like an amanah you know so by the but aku pun rasa macam serba salah lah macam need doing kaus eh macam
then dia cakap tak apa tak apa just ambil aku macam alamak macam mana tu but but you see like see aku dah macam you see ah like my my my err university journey like a hamburger lah alhamdulillah I would say that macam err my urusan has been dipermudahkan lah
uh with regards to my semester fees I mean err I have contribution from my late my my late step grandfather my late uncle and then then dia juga ah apa tu contribute to my semester fees
ah rezeki so macam like I say lah like you are tied down to something lah so aku kalau boleh macam
ya and I like somewhat in debt but at the same time aku macam
macam this is my my share lah macam aku kalau boleh tak nak mungkir tau macam because
aku rasa unless you are dedicated to the person and then macam you if you are not dedicated to the person you would not help the person all the way to the extent lah I mean as I do not know of any other person who does the same thing as me I think I'm the only one lah as of now lah
mm betul
betul understood understood I faham faham
kira him selfish lah in one way or another
mm lepas tu
oh macam gitu eh
mm betul
I mean in your situation now of the fact that kau macam you I mean you kau kau agak you are quite
you are in a situation you are in a difficult situation right now lah like like does your family macam help you out do do do they do they like err do they like give their their hand or shout out to you like eh do need help do they even ask you eh syaf kau okay tak
macam mana babe
understood understood is it intentionally atau macam
ya lah faham faham
dia pun tak tahu dia I mean in that kind of situation dia pun macam ah don't know what to say
wah the quite young ah you shavana your your brother dah ni kan oh ya ya ya ya so should be
you are now kita twenty nine
and your mum has not remarried eh sampai sekarang eh
your mum has not remarried sampai sekarang eh
understood lepas tu
kecoh ke oh my god this is so macam oh my god
yup betul betul
mean he lost it lah tak dapat
oh your oh macam your father is the macam very the old school punya ni eh
very dominant macam apa tu match up begitu tapi ni lelaki punya
ah kalau old school ya betul betul that's true it's true it's true
mm faham faham faham
mm betul
eh no err not bumi err in syurga syurga
correct correct so your your your sister said your mum said tak nak lah
betul betul to repay him back like you you you guys feel like macam aiyo kenapa aku nak kena kasih dia duit sedangkan time aku besar dia he was never there in your life
mm betul betul
so he he I mean he's I mean not not it's not calculative it's just that he likes to compare and count like that lah in money in belanja
ah faham faham faham
ah faham faham faham
mm faham faham
err dia tak go through apa you and your uh and your other siblings went through the hardship you know nak cari makan and everything and how your mum raise you guys up and everything
eh kau nangis ke kat situ
you haven't kau takde intention nak go onto public sector ke
masuk like teaching I don't know maybe
but untuk I aku rasa macam
err the ones yang err macam study hard apostrophe
will progress kuat juga then the ones yang err tak progress are the ones yang macam mediocre
will just fought out in society aku masih ingat err I remember you know the A three teacher that geography teacher err he
ah now when I think about him ah when I think about that statement ah about what he made at last time ah aku macam eh you mean people who are working in mcdonald's is that bad ah you you are that ah that
macam his statement ah macam ada sense of macam elitism you know macam macam macam how our err government ah macam gitu that kind of it's like the vibe right there the dia kasih ya
macam very similar to how the government macam how the government is like lah so aku fikir eh you mean apa yang people who don't do well or people who are just average in society I mean they they they they are not successful padahal aku rasa orang-orang macam ini they are more like happy
I mean of course they want more but they are err apa tu content with what they have so
to but I just mention the name but never mind it's it's a it's a acronym okay so um so before I went there in my head I always thought macam able to kan aku nak belajar kat sana then I'm like I I'm like how am I supposed to cope with the system over there and everything
so it was quite apprehensive lah in the beginning lah or when I went there but after I went there I realize that the system there is very different you know from singapore cause singapore kan pakai cambridge kan and sana they have their own system tau ah for apa tu macam for how to grade and grading and everything
and then kat sana aku perasan wah the they're very smart you know like the malaysian is super smart eh we're not talking about the one in you know we're talking about every other parts of the the country you know macam ones from sabah with the ones from johor
the ones from perak like aku dah aku I was quite shocked you know like my classmates are damn super smart
but aku realize about them is what they lack is
they are they are very err examination based kau faham kan exam yes book smart exam examination centered
so it's like they can they are they are hardcore memorizer you know their mark their marking style is macam hardcore memorizer
and of course the system over there is macam err the examination is err it's it's it's it's very straightforward ah macam uh you the question is there you just vomit out back that's how you score but then like if you wanna talk about like err those yang macam err critical thinker
is tak banyak tau kat sana
the ones yang critical thinker is surprisingly is the ones yang from singapore people like me and my class and my other class and my other classmates so we would tend to ask question yang macam critic yang macam higher thinking ah
but because our our education system is dah macam nurture us like this kan but bila when we go there dia orang think yang kita ni super on tau
so aku macam huh super on eh not really leh it's just that uh our just that our culture macam singapore culture has trained us to be like this macam and then some more you have to understand aku kat sana aku pay enam ribu eh
so every hour and every minute tu bagi aku is duit so if I don't ask the question am I not wasting my money and my dad's money
ya so so that's why that's why I feel like macam when ah so sometimes they they the malaysian kat sana pun bila dia orang tengok aku pun dia orang macam
dia orang they are quite intimidated lah even my classmate also told me ah yang the very first time they met me they she feels that I am aku sombong aku arrogant aku cakap eh serious ah
she say ah engkau macam poyo ah aku dah serious ah poyo
ah poyo then I'm like but but because the way I bring myself with aku I'm not the way I bring myself is my my my my like my my kepala would be like very up and then I will look at you like bitch I'm judging you that kind but I it's not like it's not like that it's just that I have to
put up a very hard exterior lah because you are overseas mah you're like you need to hustle apa and then then
alhamdulillah I would say that I am coping very well lah I mean during the first semester I got three point seven for my but it's during my second semester that aku drop really really bad because first I was very complacent second um
so can you imagine I was the one who did everything from scratch and then it got shared so I told myself err then I was not really focused ah like I still remember like the day before the exam baru aku nak belajar can you imagine
ya yang answer script
ah it's like a macam err I based err meaning ah I I will use the past year exam paper then I will answer the question then most of the time the the questions will will be almost the same ah like every four years is almost the same that's what my one of my friends told me lah ah who has studied in
um ah in semester three I was very low key nak mampus tau aku macam aku every question every every essay that I did I didn't really share with anyone I just kept quiet uh I even like um tak post anything about about me are preparing for exams I just was just very very low key ah
ya and then this coming semester four pun err aku hopefully lah I can get a err very good lah but all in all aku cakap dengan kau I mean
I don't know I don't know lah macam but but you see ah I I remember that time ah aku baru balik dari kedah tau nak balik err pergi tak silap ke singapore uh
then aku dah eh macam mana kau tahu then she say oh I know lah because of your accent and the way you talk
aku dah wow I'm shocked man
talk betul betul betul
eh err you she she's a teacher in a she is she is a graduate from singapore eh tak silap aku eh no no no err no she's a she's a alumni of
but her brother actually err studies in and err did err did her his master in something like that then the brother got married to a singaporean girl err so to cut the story short dia cakap dengan aku lah eh uh you kan orang melayu kenapa you tak stay kat malaysia err I think you should
err take this opportunity to work in malaysia I think you would try you will thrive very well in malaysia then you got me thinking eh apa dia cakap tu maybe there is a certain truth you know because kat sana aku perasan orang melayu wah babe privilege babe
macam privileged gila aku cakap privileged you know
yes yes yes exact bumiputera thing
yes yes betul betul betul then aku cakap lah eh but you know it's not that hard it's not that easy you know cause I am a singaporean malay then err aku cakap dengan dia lah I was very frank with her I told her err you know how kat sini kita
err macam casing kita punya bangsa kan macam tindaskan
err or we are being like extra lah kirakan not extra lah we're just being err we are we we we're looked down
tapi kat sana it's err it's bangsa dia orang yang look down kau faham kan so dia macam terbalik err macam dia err aku cakap dengan very frank ah then dia cakap ya I faham I faham tapi tapi aku rasa sana pun dia dia rakyat is not
I mean is a very hustle and bustle city lah but the expenses there is mahal nak mampus
I find like macam barang-barang dah macam barang-barang the shampoo body shower oh wah I tell you mahal sangat macam satu
one body shower macam dove eh twenty four ringgit eh siala twenty four ringgit when you pay when you pay fifty ringgit to pay for the twenty four ringgit and when you left with that balance eh macam kiwak macam eh this is very expensive leh but when in singapore
when you pay fifty dollars for the same amount of eight dollars you you have the balance is still a lot kan then it's like worth it kan padahal it's the same current it's the same rate but just different currency so honestly if you ask me whether
I always thought like macam is quite cheap aku I when I go over to like macam kedah I go penang wah it's even cheaper sia barang-barang dia then I'm like I'm quite shocked lah in one way or another
and then err I mean I always got teased off lah I always got teased yang eh err by my classmate eh kau tak nak kahwin ke dengan orang malaysia
aku macam ah kahwin orang malaysia kau tahu tak aku punya preference apa
no I'm serious I mean I I have I have this classmate she's orang johor you know so she dia macam dia macam merajuk you know dengan aku because aku macam friend zone dia
no no no that one is another girl that one is another class that one is another department err that one is err sastera that one is my my my own classmate lah and then macam macam mana aku tak friend zone dia babe dia
dia she's from okay dia not very the feminine kind of girl oh dia macam very kasar then dia suara very loud and then dia very macam err like you you can sense a presence you know and then she's very she participate in every college activities
and then aku kalau aku betul-betul nak menghala kepada
ke jalan yang lurus and then my choice of girl is somewhat very feminine you know macam honestly like ya ya ya I mean yang orang yang pakai tudung yang very very very manis to look at I don't know ah that is my kind of preference ah when it comes to
ah sia aku macam siala I mean
ah syak kurang ajar lah tak lah but I don't know I mean I don't know you never know what you never know err our future like who knows maybe kau one day get married or aku one day get married you'll never know
but but innocence that macam aku punya preference when comes to I have I have a type of of of of lady of or a girl and yang aku suka lah and my preference is macam yang putih yang dia no need no dia tak perlu putih sangat it's just putih dia pakai tudung ke very very typically uh
eh aku tak hitam kita sawo kita sawo matang kulit kita is sawo matang
sawo matang tanned tanned sawo matang
so err ya so and then kurang ajar tak lah hitam is hitam and then after that um then aku kat sana aku kan macam abang-abang aku kan macam abang-abang singapore kan
ah ya ya ya you know my suara is always like hello
and then lagi suara aku ah my my voice will bounce apa whenever I use the mic when it comes to presentation err in lecture hall
so macam I'm known as the suara abang-abang lah but then dia orang tak tahu lah they akan close all
no I'm serious ah no aku dah macam aku cakap dengan kau aku macam double lives ah kat sana you know like
in school I am like quite err the abang-abang but
ah eh babe do you know that aku that time menang err did I did I show you a picture that I aku menang err prince of the night you know for for an event
macam ah so I I won like a prom kingish punya competition
I know it sounds crazy aku pun tak sangka and I was the host emcee for the event and and the judge was my lecturer so what he he he actually chose me as the prom king err or the prince of the night aku dah huh apa ni
no because um he chose me because I was I was one of the I was ultimately I was the only one who dressed very well that night aku ah because I was wearing blazer
ah ya I was I was wearing blazer then I bought this like yellow punya macam like a macam like a apa tu belt ke apa dah apa-apa lah and then I yellow err
I think ada I pun nak tunjuk you guys ah then so I was quite shocked lah so
so like err like err like I tell you like I I feel like I'm living a double life macam kat kat sekolah aku macam very quiet quiet baik-baik but
but at the same time aku aku kan quite wild kan like you know the number of people aku met aku err make friends with babe by in instagram by in facebook I'm still making friends up to today
I mean it's called networking lah although kawan aku yang kat singapore ni tak err I have I aku tak pernah disclose anything about it to do you know even that time I post err something about me going to kedah in my instagram
wei babe dia sampai err dia he actually
then lepas tu member dah sedih eh so dia dalam keadaan sakit dia dia boleh lagi sedih and aku dah macam eh kan kau dalam keadaan sakit kau boleh fikir yang aku nak macam

so macam ah you don't have to tell the other like I don't have to tell my friend lah because it's my prerogative apa
ya this my acts also apa so but
so I was like telling myself oh no no tak boleh aku dah I I cannot post this kind of err this kind of post anymore because he will be triggered eh ni nama ni triggered dia triggered gila dia triggered lepas tu dia triggered lepas tu dia start questioning me lah macam kau pergi dengan siapa and everything lepas tu dia dah start
ya then dia macam sedih lah dia dah sedih and everything aku dah eh siala ni member nak sedih
engkau ah kalau you see eh if you are sakit kau tak payah fikir tau benda begini you don't even have to think about all these all you think is about your preparation to meet
siap aku cakap dengan kau ah aku pun sometimes pun macam bila dia nak macam err intimate dengan aku aku sometimes pun I tried to elak you know because
berdosa kan kau orang tu tengah sakit lepas tu engkau kau engkau macam add onto ke fill onto his desire dia memang ada desire tu kita tak menafikan everyone has desire desire
but kena control lah aku pun cakap dengan dia eh you control lah you tak boleh terlalu on sangat leh because you never know ah in any bila kau orang cakap dia tengah kita tengah buat or kita tengah intimate sekali err tuhan tarik nyawa dia ke gila
in that kind of state ke you know because it's he's in that kind of that state state and then he's like he's super sensitive I mean at the end of the day in every situation err kalau tuhan nak tarik nyawa kau people err god would just take away your nyawa lah understood I mean
I'm trying my best to just keep up with my studies kita pun lagi tiga minute correct kalau you berapa minit babe kat situ
okay so aku pun tengah trying to keep up lah with my studies I mean I'm left with just err semester five six and seven so semester seven I'll be in here in singapore doing my internship
I I as of now I have no intention to work in malaysia lah unless there is a good opportunity for me but even so err I did ask macam consulted over there lah like they say like they if you're a foreigner you are given like macam temporary contract eh
so aku tak nak ambil contract I aku rasa it is very risky to be doing contract work and then on top of that kau kena cari err rumah then on top of that kau kena settle your visa and all those shenanigans so aku cakap no no no I think I rather work in singapore so it depends on which industry I'm going to
but you see ah the thing is I aku because I'm here mah so I am not able to network as fast
as I'm over there so kalau kalau if you were there is is is it's easy for me to network and everything but I'm trying my best to like network lah and the end of the day aku pun tak sure lah what kind of err prospects I want to do
I I see myself writing for a article in a journal you know I mean it's it's an academic journal so and the um I mean that's that's the thing that aku aku don't mind doing lah but for me to do that is like I need to go into the academic
punya sector like to become I'm not necessarily become a lecturer but maybe err
err take my master and maybe I don't know take my in language and because at the end of the day err in language pun tak banyak orang yang ambil apa unless you are really passionate and interested in it lah
ah what and tails and and and then you just hope for the best lah but I'm just glad that my study punya period is going to be be done and over with very very soon
so kalau tak kesah ah kalau it's not practical
okay like maybe first would be I want the bank account that will like refresh itself tau tak dia tak err like I don't need to put duit inside lah biar dia biar pakai jer refresh to the original amount so kalau macam gitu err I don't need like a lot of money I just have enough money but enough is good jadi like tak sombong gitu ah
top up ah top up tapi bukan kita yang top up ah
uh tak tahu siapa yang top up ah tapi terima kasih jer
nak kahwin oh tapi that's your first wish tu mesti mesti ada boyfriend dulu ah
terus suami eh takde boyfriend tapi now you got boyfriend right
tapi korang ada pernah macam uh fight ke apa ke
so far belum ah mm okay tapi sekarang kan
sekarang kan macam COVID kan so cannot really meet each other that much apa
oh but how frequently tu
but like for me I remember bila I was dating kan uh we meet everyday sebab sama sekolah apa so kita orang sekolah sama kerja sama in the weekends so hari-hari dah tengok sama punya muka so bila kahwin I also know that takkan jelak ah
tak serik ah tapi okay ah dah dah come on ah dah nak sepuluh tahun jadi kalau dah tak serik tak jelak tu should be fine lah kan
eh panggil dia apa makcik cik
apa-apa jer jumpa dia kat mana kat rumah dia
oh tapi dah it's like coincidence ke atau memang nak jumpa dia
bapa dia tak kasi untuk dia mak dia tak kasi dia keluar atau like atau tak kasi dia jumpa you
oh ya ya ya oh dia tak tahu
mak dia jer tahu ah
oh asal dia tak bilang
ya macam why he why he like want to like keep it secret seh
okay so do you guys like macam
if your oldest you usually will mix with the youngest then kalau like the youngest hang out with oldest middle child I don't know ah middle chair honestly I don't know
problem with that so far takde lah
bagus lah K wait so what's your what's your horoscope and zodiac like what are you guys
oh eh apa bara api tu scary juga tu nanti kalau like if one of you all like marah habis sia dua-dua volcano seh
so like your chinese one your you you're what ah tiger right ya tiger memang ah
macam a'ah bara api gitu tiger fierce
tapi belum belum belum apa apa apa so baru tiga bulan so you don't know lah like
cause for me and my husband kalau kita kita dah jumpa everyday monday to sunday
so we dated six months kita macam dah tahu each other gitu ah so we hardly like ever fight cause we kinda know before we
fight that okay I did something wrong then kita orang cakap ah kita mesti cakap ah like must communicate and talk ya
then for you guys dia sekarang sekolah right so he berapa tahun lagi eh
oh he's just a normal lah bukan honours lah
okay okay cause I think honours is like five years gitu
mm four years so dia macam
okay dia start dia belajar apa
gitu-gitu ah
oh first year already tak surviving oh rabak hancur seh
exam exam ah okay so dia sekarang end of the first year
if he pergi counselling the course counselling he might have to restart lah
three four more years with something you don't like kan lagi exams means you have to study for it
tu ah and he's still so young he's like what twenty five kan so so I feel like he still got a long way to go like doesn't really matter ah ya cause like in the end if you take this kind of degree then what if you have to pursue that kind of career then lagi rabak then his whole life will be electrical engineering which is like
I think macam dia kena fikir betul-betul lah kalau dia kalau dia nak continue ke atau dia nak
like tukar ke because like one year is still okay tapi bila dah two years gitu kan then I think that's when it's err there's more at stake because you're gonna waste about two years ya but first year still okay lah kalau nak tukar right ya and I think it's quite easy to actually switch switch like courses switch like your degree in the school
no no like in for example like kalau in in so actually kalau some people right they will uh come to the school to a course they don't want and then after that they spend one year there and they will switch to a different course a course that they want even though they weren't they didn't qualify at first sebab lagi senang but you waste one year lah but you get to go to the course you actually want ya
uh uh so like macam gitu pun boleh lah kalau if you want because a lot of people kat poly also they do that so like my friend they sometimes do that like it will just go in to like err some course that they don't like like engineering gitu then past one year in they get good results and then they try to muscle another like a different completely different diploma yang dorang nak and then after dorang masuk then they get to go ah so it for them is like um ya you you sacrifice one year ah to do what you want then so you can think of it like that gitu
okay so dia dah tapi dia electrical engineering before that
diploma okay so that means at least he has a diploma in game design and stuff asal dia tak pergi digipen
like I'll I'll go for the one that I think I cannot reach first then I'll try my hardest but then kalau tak boleh you know that you tried your best then you go to something that you feel that you can manage or you can handle ya because you know that at least you tried your best lah
I don't think there's a lot of choices creatively at least for ada tau art design on media that one at least ah there's some form of creative output but for I really don't know
ya so like macam my teacher in lasalle the one I'm doing degree that one that time [kan] she's actually teaching for that and then she ask us whether we want to pursue in masters in that topic I I didn't want lah so eh I mean I feel like
um I'm okay tapi I feel like I gone I got degree already so I want to at least do something about it I don't want to like
you think I'm like by the time I graduated I was already what twenty five ya so macam I felt like I needed to work or at least do something ah like not school for once gitu
ya pretty much even though like kat uni I I took a two year break to to like venture into like my like entrepreneur stuff tapi then I went back so ya then I think
you know do all that research and but after you work for awhile right um what I heard from my classmates ah yang dah dorang bekerja kan then dorang dah bekerja berapa tahun ah at the most sepuluh tahun gitu then dorang come back to like get just get a degree dorang betul-betul lupa macam mana nak belajar macam mana nak tulis like an essay like how to write essay all that dorang dah lupa
ya so um that was one of the reasons why I wanted to like just continue cause I scared that I will like lose the the hang of it gitu
ya then I'll forget how to write an essay and then uni in uni you need to write a thesis so it's like just words and words and words apa
berapa tahun eh berapa tahun
oh satu eh
so kalau you want to really go into uni like where when are you thinking
lepas kahwin betul-betul nak kahwin dulu eh
oh is there a reason why you want to like kahwin first
um in terms of stress kan lepas kahwin eh you'll get less stress about the things that you feel are very stressful for you cause like you know before I kahwin and then lepas tu like I felt very
um stressed out sebab like nak our our mum she ah she like makes all the decisions I have to respect her I've to respect the decision and ayah decision and it is very difficult because they sometimes they don't understand but now after I married I'm like my
the guardianship sort of is under my husband so he's more understanding and he's more like my way of thinking gitu so I feel definitely less stressed you know like I I
tapi takde apa-apa ah because ah kalau orang tanya pun I will just say oh my husband he's okay with apa so in the end religiously uh culturally it's okay ya that that's what I think ah so
kau siapa seh
so my suami is super like easy going dia faham everything I'm very honest to him
kalau I'm going to this place ke apa I'm going to overnight there I'll tell him lah I'm going to overnight kat tempat ni with my friends we just wanna chill kalau nak ikut ikut ah like like that's what I'm like with him so and that's what I'm like with that's why he's like with me also so kalau dia nak keluar ke apa with his friends I'm also okay like I think must have that kind of understanding lah so I don't have the stress and pressure that I had when I was under my parents
kahwin ya
ya betul lah
tu ah
then macam I feel like you're going to have to go through a wedding that you don't actually want
malangnya I think you want like my kind of wedding
ulam seh kampung kat mana ni kampung apa malaysia
pulau ubin dorang nak tutup apa
semakau pergi tekong tekong sudah pergi
kalau nak pergi kat malaysia kita masih ada saudara-saudara kat sana
ah tak rapat ah tapi ada lah ada tu ada lah
filter kau block yourself you block yourself you know
kau block sendiri but then the rental will be insane
ah betul lah uh then mm pulau ubin is actually quite interesting for a wedding
like like are they chinese ke malay ke oh
takde motor takde kereta ah bagus kau
dia jemput jer semua orang tapi actually tak jemput semua orang indirectly lah
orang agaknya yang keluarga yang dorang tak suka semua kat west kat east east so dorang pilih yang paling jauh sekali dorang pilih yang uh yang uh um uh kat tuas situ kat johor masuk masuk ah johor masuk tapi kalau kau orang uh tampines pasir ris tak payah datang sudah waste your time
so dorang kat sana kat mana dorang the majlis kat mana
is like you only go there kalau nak show off
kan like if you just want to show off cakap like you like you got a lot of money then okay lah sentosa lah but if not then why why there right there's so many other places in singapore yang you can actually get
pay for everyone's ferries still will save money gitu
uh tapi ada timer ah dah reach dah reach harbourfront okay habis wedding habis
uh uh uh unless if unless if like you ah ambil the cruise ship yang pergi batam and back ah then okay got time tapi ada cruise yang sekarang they just like just float float float around then come back you know they hardly go and anyway and then by the end of the day you you reach the place ya and which is harbourfront and back lah so kalau macam gitu susah sikit ah
and orang tak boleh datang like wherever they want they have to come bila bila cruise dia dah nak ship off gitu ah
a'ah ambil kapal sendiri kalau tak kau kau ambil lah sampan kau bawa sampan kau kelakar seh nanti dorang dayung sampan
alamak susahnya nak datang aku tempat ni ya allah
I think at night lah we should do that like in the day we can keep it like very civil very like you know then bila dah malam kan then we say oh uh all the makcik pergi tidur and stuff and then terus we got to the club and then terus
so you went with adik
buffet jer buffet lah buffet dia halal lah
oh chilli crab pun ada
if you have a staycation then we got like swimming pool and then we can like enjoy like we get the ones yang macam the one I went that time the intercontinental like intercontinental had like is the swimming pool and gym had like yoga room so like they we had a lot of places to go ah even if it's just the hotel alone ya so even when it was like um
ya so I tried one and it was so bad it was for the like hardcore people is super like is like eh is not even like espresso it's worse than espresso ya so rabak so I didn't even K I didn't even like
uh uh but okay lah it was fun lah it was for once you get to feel like macam orang kaya gitu uh tapi like ya that's it lah but I don't know lah like
kalau korang nak um pergi staycation ke tak
I know the kalau if the d'kranji here is
clean certified clean certified then maybe kita boleh pergi sana
cause there is like very secluded kan so it's a different experience gitu like out of city life
uh tapi I you still don't know what you want to spend right with your hundred
uh you and me will have this share the room and then he and abang hafiz will share lah
uh so kita halalkan lah
oh so susah tu but no if they like
uh uh a bit of conversation to starter someone who can start a conversation at least cause kalau if it's two hafizes I mean both tak boleh seh
uh uh so I think macam okay lah like we we can do that but it depends ah like cause I really want to like staycation but the thing is I don't know who wants to go and where we go things like that I'm like
I'm begging and like desperately wanting one like get away tu ah
mm january gitu okay
ya lah but I mean okay lah we can we can always go tapi the thing is like you said ah must plan lah ya
oh ya the one you told me yang dia
I mean dorang pun macam orang melayu lah you have to understand lah kita orang pun macam everything also macam relax apa
tak ikut sangat ah but
ya so I feel like macam
macam gitu it will be really susah for them to
and indonesia pun teruk teruk seh
like indonesia is teruk
kalau tengok dia punya cases
ah betul
indonesia is also like quite high death rate kan death percentage considering like when you compare it with everyone else gitu
so this is very scary ah like lagi dorang pun I don't think they care then they are so dense gitu the the country
ya ya ya like even for ours like we have all the preventive measures kan err then err but for them dorang tak ada pun I mean kita bila we needed the extra space terus kita pergi tukar expo lah tukar all the places that we already have tapi tak pakai apa because COVID kan so we use that place to um immediately make it a space for the COVID nineteen patients
tapi kalau indonesia I think susah because kan singapore kan kita kan asyik kiasu kan kita semua mesti buat cepat cepat cepat tapi kalau indonesia semua relax
dorang relax jer kita kan kiasu everything must be like a bit too much and then because of that it helps us also to be overly prepared but for indonesia I doubt that they are actually prepared because
mm uh dorang pun macam kalau mati mati lah dah sakit that's their thinking ah dah sakit apa sakit so kalau mati sakit apa nak jadi
so dorang tak macam fikir macam betul-betul gitu ah dorang tak fikir masak-masak macam kenapa macam mana boleh uh manage kan all these things ah so it's very hard for them ah like india also is very very very bad
ya ya ya yang teruknya kan a lot of the old people are dying and there's this like thinking saying like a rumour ah saying that it's
a'ah but like I feel like it's somewhat true because dorang really tak kesah for the for the old people
ah then like dorang macam they will only like take in like patients yang have a chance of survival
that's that's how bad their their condition is it's like dulu punya america
ya during um last time when america was quite bad kan I mean now it's still bad but last time when it was really really bad they also had to had made the kind of decision like who has a better rate of survival then they will help that person so macam kesian ah but in india it's like that every day now
ya I I feel like ya but I mean the government can do much more tapi they don't so there must be a reason why why they're doing it like you know
ya I mean even singapore we are an ageing population but we don't do that kita cakap lepas tu kita bilang uh yang orang-orang tua jangan keluar jangan like
don't mess lah don't mess with other don't go meet with other people all that tu kan
ya tapi orang-orang tua dorang kan uh tak nak memang tak nak dorang sendiri tak nak tu dorang punya pasal lah kan kita orang dah cakap pakai mask and jangan uh jangan keluar-keluar banyak sangat tapi dorang kan kalau nak keluar keluar lah apa nak jadi
because they are older right so we have to respect them so even if we don't want to ya so macam um there was this atuk not atuk ah pek in the bus and he wasn't wearing mask you know and he was coughing and everyone was just like oh no but we can't say anything to him so we were just like
like we will just like huh like what what are we supposed to do you know ah but like kita tak boleh buat apa-apa cause he's just like he is obviously looks like he doesn't wanna talk to anyone he doesn't want anyone to approach him about it also so I'm like okay
orang tak suka pakai mask and they will like meet up you know like they will meet up in the void deck so a couple of
ah pek together kadang-kadang more than five people and then they will like they will just talk talk talk macam biasa lah macam tak ada COVID gitu tapi kita orang tak boleh buat apa-apa kita orang just biarkan jer ah
correct the security guard I think trying to find something to do lah dia dah dia dah like bored lah I think
ya that's why some some guards are like like they really got nothing better to do some guards cannot be bothered like you know the are some like those like people like sitting there dorang tak tengok pun tau kalau kalau kau scan ke kau tak scan ke dorang just masuk dia kasi masuk jer dorang tak kesah kan ya so it's like it's so like uh jarring you know sometimes ya but I feel like at least okay lah singapore got like precautions to keep everything like safe you know like safe and stuff like that because if not ah I think it will be bad because we are so dense we are such a dense so densely populated like island ya like
um but because everyone has to wear mask so tak tak boleh buat apa-apa so it's that's why tak ada macam transmission not so much of transmission ah ya
to go out or go to see the doctor when you go see the doctor don't take bus take the take the private take Grab or something like that kan so err it's it's like already in our we already know you know like um the social way to like macam social responsibility lah ya ya like so like we are now it's like like second nature already cause dah berapa lama seh dah berapa bulan going to one year I feel
quite surprised that we had to spend a whole year or twenty twenty in a pandemic but it's not as bad as what I thought it was going to be luckily because we're here sebab kan kalau kalau negara lain negeri lain is like wow betul-betul rabak like but kat singapore they handled it quite well especially for the foreign worker punya time that time bila dorang hari-hari berapa ratus seh ya
with soap like dulu kan siapa nak cuci tangan dengan soap I ask you like tak ada seh all the aunty ah wash hand only wash water can already lah dorang memang mesti tak pakai soap punya mana ada pakai soap seh
now now they don't now they're like ah ya kalau tak wash nanti eh you never wash you never like use the soap ah then lepas tu baru dorang
you you really pakai the soap ya
good things comes of it uh come out from it lah ya ya ya betul lah like I think it's um inevitable lah like we have to learn it the hard way also ya but because of that we are much cleaner society like you know our toilets are cleaner
so the toilets are generally cleaner ah so like okay ah it's not bad ah um mean at least now we are not like confine you know lockdown kan and know france kan dah second lockdown
ya rather than macam kat sweden where it's like free and easy and then wow the death rates are like crazy seh
the there's a lot more cases actually then now it's quite bad kat japan lah so dorang kena mula balik ah everything lah have to go back the mask and all that err I mean for mask I think they're okay ya but social distancing all that stuff lah ya I think everywhere is still quite bad eh but not only some of the other countries some very very few countries that are having it controlled even for us we had that one of the guy at seoul garden kan kesian seh
tapi for me I kesian dia dia macam aku nak makan kat seoul garden sekali dengan kawan-kawan keluarga-keluarga aku terus terkena tu ah tu ah macam kesian seh ah nasib baik dia pergi doctor
ah naisb baik dia pergi doctor then lepas tu you know it can be people can get detected and stuff so it's it's still not so bad ya and is only one guy right for that day only one guy but he had a big group ya ah tu ah so
I mean I think kesian ah macam he got more hate than
what he should have gotten gitu ya
no dorang three tables uh
so there were still like macam bergroup tapi err it was distance distance three distance tables but I think they got mix around lah macam kadang-kadang dorang mix like you sit here I sit there ke apa mix food err so maybe have that kind of thing ya so there's the um the fear that they have lah
ya so kesian ah
and dia dia sakit kan dia pergi doctor then bila dah kena COVID and the check up oh at least I was with twelve other people
even though we actually followed lah the rules and stuff kat sini seoul garden ah if me I think I wouldn't say so much seh I diam diam jer tak lah but like I feel like macam why get myself into more trouble than than what I have already kan ya so I feel like um he's actually good part ah for him to be really responsible also
ya exactly cause it's like we're trying to get back to norm and then you know the japanese he's he actually recommended err people to wear mask even when we're eating I don't know when we're eating or drinking then I'm like I saw the headline then I was like apa seh
like what the hell does that even mean gitu uh uh so I I was like wow this prime minister really wants to like err reduce the number of COVID but I have no idea how he plans to do that
uh uh I think it was like you know you like open a bit from the bottom then you makan then I'm like but it's so like
how then I'm like I don't know like that's it's ridiculous but he said it in national so err ya macam gitu like I don't even I I I don't know how he's going to do it don't know how the japanese people are gonna do it ah bagus ah dorang habis ah a'ah tu ah like macam it's
ya ya ya he's just like ah give up lah dah mengaku kalah
ya they are do trying to do that they have a lot of small initiative to macam err cheer up the community gitu um it doesn't evade the fact that they're going through a difficult time lah
so one person talk then one person answer K okay so topic permulaan
okay I don't know what happen I was at home tengah keluar masuk bilik cari makanan as usual cari air then suddenly mama on the sofa scrolling her Facebook and then she say the kranji resort ni macam cantik let's all go stay for holiday gitu ah satu three day two night something like that
no she just ask like korang nak pergi farm stay tak I initially said no because it's at kranji and I always told her like nanti sana ada momok
I think so ya dia dekat dengan sungei buloh all the way sia I check on Google
actually I solve that problem already like yesterday um I went to research more lah like the the reviews of this place so I saw on tripadvisor that they spend like three hundred and eighty five dollars for one villa for one night it was very expensive and they said the place is so rundown abeh macam tak ada makanan and stuff like that ah
then there was another review I showed mama that this family had to spend like close to six hundred dollars because there was no food there so they have to go out and buy the barbecue nya barang barbecue over there so ya the review was like all one star one star one star those were pretty recent like ya yesterday it was seventeen eighteen november kan the review was on sixteen november just two days before
huh sekarang hotel tengah macam staycation package gitu kan
baru keluar eh ah later I go check
I ask mama what about snow city because it's the nearest to our house and we have never been there before so might as well pergi sana mama kata tak pernah nampak snow that time she went to bugger she just saw like one to three ah sikit gitu jer
yes it was a son of a peach then lepas tu I share with mama then mama was like eh tu dekat dengan apa rumahnya mak punya rumah kan tu is it the new house is it
tu mama dah start dia punya
oh yang block one two eight eh
boleh lah dah terlanjur
wow was this like during the time of the makcik keropok yang datang rumah abeh orang semua macam
oh no makcik keropok was much later I think was in that time
makcik keropok has been going around for quite long ah I don't know when we moved to our house dekat clementi kan think I was in uni that time then there was this bibik indonesian who tengah jual keropok and then it was I think malam lah macam lapan lepas maghrib bibik tu ketuk pintu abeh tanya nak jual keropok
then mama tengah kat living room I open the door mama straight away jump up and then she started screaming like adik adik then the bibik kasihan tau the bibik was like saya bukan hantu saya bukan hantu saya betul-betul benar-benar mahu jual keropok gitu
then I was like I alamak mak aku tak baik seh dia terus panic gabrah depan depan bibik tu but I ended up buying a few keropok lah cause kasihan
ee bacin
lepas renovation hopefully dah okay lah tapi nak kena hack balik ah takut pijat-pijat bau takpe bau will go away but it's the pijat that maybe can come back
kat dalam-dalam ah
like really people who really don't know how to take care of their things actually like time beli rumah time tengok-tengok rumah your parents didn't know they have twenty cats inside the room
mm agaknya eh
tengah renovation ke
alamak okay lah tak lah nanti kalau kita bebual nanti tak dengar sangat
I tried linkedin I tried um my careers future which is tak bagus tak guna punya
or like macam singtel you know government related jobs ya and then um the the the macam amount of jobs kat situ tak banyak sangat lah kat my career future so I tried also the other one which is job street lah job street has the most but job street is mostly recruit recruiters ah or even if they have job like macam they call me back dia punya job dekat east side dekat loyang because I do supply chain mah so a bit too far for me lah
tak ada the good thing is like macam I attended all these itu job fairs and all these job fairs err there will be someone who will call me back and ask me if um anything positive come out of the the the job fair macam ada interview ke tak then I will just let them know that ada ke tak which I will always say none I attended follow back with me follow up with me on any interviews or what then they said okay never mind will still continue to search for you
eh tak tahu I will try
okay lah sekarang job market macam gitu so I'm just waiting for twenty twenty one ah for things to be better
itu jer so sad
oh so now he's only the only one stuck there but his family dah balik sini lah
sana tak ada macam like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
okay question what are your thoughts about the changi punya restaurant a three eighty thing where you pay money to eat the first class food in the airplane
when the news came out she ask me adik do you want to go and eat at the airport the aeroplane there the first class mama nak try makan first class tak pernah duduk alah tak boleh fly kan duduk kat dalam aeroplane dapat makan pun jadi lah gitu so I told mama for the price that you pay ah I would rather save up the money and actually fly first class to somewhere than just sit there and eat
I remember like I I did say that out um mama did say that she want me to macam take them go jalan-jalan lain kali daya bawa pula lah because like the last time she went japan macam korang bawa dia kan so she said to me lain kali daya bawa lah kita jalan-jalan so I told mama
cara I jalan-jalan later you all don't like one good thing is I very relax so some days you can don't go out if you are tired but another good thing is I like to backpack and all these things stay in dorm you all must hotel then how ya
but penat seh masa tu kita pergi japan banyak jalan so I don't think they would want to cook also I also don't want to cook the japan food very nice
sedap but the sedap is what the cook is malaysian cook ah or japanese cook
I never try nasi lemak on airplane before
things to note nak kena try nasi lemak kat silk air important question nak fly tu bila tu aiya I hope they can find a cure for this COVID seh
betul punya travel bubble eh from one island to another island
oh ya a'ah orang semua nak balik negeri
dah relax dah kan
oh dah thirty minutes already
a'ah still a lot of things juga
eh then they hack it out then outside is what kosong jer oh
ya then I have to think about K sale of balance cause sale of balance usually macam reject reject punya kalau orang tak suka the areas ah the units ah
ah atas tong sampah gitu ah ada orang tak suka tempat tong sampah atau rumah punya fengshui tak bagus ke yang at least the good thing is tak ada momok ah kalau resale kan
yang tengah yang tengah have lah tengah have
ya actually ya I would so I was thinking of that also macam cause I saw like
on property property ninety nine I think ninety nine dot com the app tu kan so people who live in like edgefield plains kat kawasan sengkang they are pretty new and they were selling the house although house is quite cheap the house is actually still in good condition ya ah macam kau masuk terus dah siap
I want like macam cement floor macam gini kan macam cement floor
it look like macam cement gitu like concrete gitu
so I was thinking of something like this lah macam yang penting colour grey bawah tu look a bit like cement
korang ada skirting tak kita letak skirting juga lah
because I was thinking that kalau if I move out to my own place I think I need to bring pluto along with me I told about mama papa I don't want to live alone so I confirm nanti bawa pluto sekali lah so I also think about oh if you want to have a house nanti pluto need her own cat tree lah you need to catify the house semua kan
so that's why I'm like thinking about what I want to do to the house and how much I must save there are people who spend like eighty thousand dollars on renovation abeh rumah dia macam minimalist gitu and it's eighty thousand dollars
cause I I don't want to like macam have a lot of build in I was thinking of just by IKEA furniture
ye lah si kecil tu dekat rumah cekau-cekau jer now the kayu-kayu semua nak terkopek so that's why I'm thinking like that ah tak payah lah beli mahal-mahal beli macam murah kayu simple simple then IKEA kan macam batau furniture then after five years can throw already
they katuk very fast eh
a lot of macam renovation company mcam dorang katuk very fast
oi kejapnya dah rosak
hood jatuh
oh ah reno talk bagus ya ya
I was actually looking at counter tops semalam cause I had berangan nak okay nak macam kayu punya butcher countertop pastu kan cement floor gini kan and then dia punya ah tempat cabinet dia colour putih gitu so I was thinking oh very nice colour putih macam a bit rustic sikit butcher block then sekali when I read about the butcher block is literally just a chopping board so nak kena letak mineral oil semua nak kena maintain tu yang leceh
oh macam boleh buat back splash terus gitu eh
wow tak pernah dengar ni vulcan
nak kena wax tak atau sealing ke apa
entah she tak mention apa she just said that ah nanti kalau singgah sheng siong bilang eh
betul but I'm not going to go sheng siong I'm going to go daiso but I don't know I think jcube got one daiso
padahal dekat but still uh need to walk further
choa chu kang nya dah siap
COVID happened kau nak kena bagi chance dekat dorang
but it's near to mama and papa so when I'm malas to cook I can just walk over
ah mama actually said that she say kau jangan pergi dekat tu sengkang jauh-jauh ni kau dekat-dekat jer dari lah dekat clementi resale pun tak apa
buruk-buruk one
ah then dah buat ni semua aiya tak payah pindah
ya lah tak payah pindah stay there for what at most also you just need to renovate the room that taufik has been using to keep his things did you see the canvas I saw a lot of like shoes they use the small rooms they change it to like a home office with like a see through glass it's very nice
true lah singapore susah nak cari yang perfect perfect
a'ah seh kasihan your neighbour only got one plant and then korang letak banyak-banyak
pokok hang dia satu jer tanam lah pokok-pokok hang banyak sikit
actually good lah the jiran that's okay tu pun susah nak dapat
oh dorang alternate kan
try teaching ah macam mana nak teaching I like teaching I don't like you heard that I like teaching I don't like
oh okay okay okay faham faham
that's why I really macam tabik ah those people who go teaching cause you you don't even have time to teach you spend more time on benda-benda remeh-remeh semua layankan parent layankan principal
kindergarten no I got no patience with yang kecil-kecil yang masih berak dalam seluar
yang kat luar tu semua habis ah pecah-pecah
eh bijak eh dia bijak
tu lah kalau anak saudara sendiri okay tapi kalau jaga anak orang lain like in a school setting is different the kids have different values they come from different backgrounds kalau anak saudara at least the values are still similar you know kalau budak tu ada problem can always easy for you to speak to the parents
dah hafal script ah gitu
for me tuition was different okay like macam I know that the syllabus are ajar macam gini kan but with each kid they are at different at how should I say different macam not say education level like macam tahap kefahaman dorang is different so macam maybe in class the teacher already dah start on algebra but the kids punya foundation is still very weak so although dorang dah sec one and they are already doing algebra their understanding of maths is still macam at primary four primary five ya so
is a bit interesting lah for me like every single student is like a project different materials different way of teaching ah ada budak macam they really need ah physical experiment to really understand mathematical concept I mean as adults right when we look at maths we think macam is very straightforward one plus one equals to two but to a kid who has no understanding of what is maths at all kan
they will be like apa tu one kenapa one kenapa one plus one kenapa tak boleh one and that kind of thing
actually it's not that hard I realise okay lah because for me um I teach budget tuition and I teach orang kita orang kita mak-mak dorang macam more or less macam ah relax jer kau datang class kan dia kasi epok-epok lah dia sibuk kasi kau makan dulu for them is I just want you to sit next to my kid and make sure my kid does his work
tu dorang punya um general generally lah most of them dorang punya mindset is like that there are a few macam one or two who come and they say like oh I want my kids to get A padahal the kid is already a B student so for me macam when I come in actually there's not so much work on my part it's just that I want the kid to be interested in learning once the kid dah interested in learning automatic terus dorang A sendiri so jadi tak stress macam gitu
yang stress is when you haven't start the parent macam ah kepoh kepoh lah like you can you go through this for my kid can you look can you go through that for my kid ah macam gitu tu leceh sikit
ajar budak-budak madrasah ah madrasah kids were very very nice
but I feel so sad for them because when they share with me the school punya how the school life is right then I realise the quality of education is very different ya I had one like this student everytime I read it so one year is one older than the other take three the other one take two
so he was sharing that their maths teacher is the same teacher I think science teacher was the same teacher the teacher is like some makcik like very old lady who in the class will just sit down and talk talk talk talk talk talk so they don't understand what's going on in the lesson
I because madrasah under private school kan
okay what al al-irsyad ah eh but al-irsyad susah nak masuk eh
sekolah tahfiz ah
eh but it's good you know because like I see like a lot of people who graduate from madrasah like oh my god they have like masters and double masters because nineteen subject for O levels is nothing you know they are doing two masters at university level is nothing is a longer route for them but even at thirty years old they're still doing like all these ya this is like nothing for them
okay mah tak salah pe but I notice this trend tau macam my friends who are in education or their wife who are in education wah they really start planning the education route early on baby masih dalam perut dah planning tau nak hantar childcare ni lepas umur ni pergi this school nanti pastu hantar ni
macam we all orang biasa relax ah pergi sekolah good enough already ah
as an adult I wanted to be a farmer I apply kat kok fah kena reject seh sedih
it's not tak kuat sangat ah but
ya but only to cari like shows
sub Reddits I've been I've been rewatching this show vikings you tengok ke
ah cause dulu I watched it like
I watched like the first three seasons like religiously habis
ya ya ya that's why he tembak like the canon ball semua kan habis the benda macam
apa lalu jadi macam pirate ah basically so like our
orang bugis right pirates
what the hell is piawai
what the hell is piawaian
what does kepiawaian mean in indonesian
huzaifi you you read a melayu
primary school melayu textbook you probably need it to be translated for you also
orh kepiawaian means expertise or skill
err mahathir like the malaysian punya prime minister kan
he referred to the bugis people as pirates and then after that like the malaysian royals marah dengan dia
it's like eh kau jangan main main aku aku darah what is pirate in melayu ah
oh kau jangan main main aku ada darah lanun
ya dulu lah I think
I dulu bila I time

I like pernah dengar orang kata orang bugis pirate then I like

I fikir for like tiga tahun sia
and after that I finally masuk then I was like okay
already like I think tiga tahun in I saved up enough money then I was like ah I I cannot lah later I go later they throw me into like mono intake infantry or something cause I got tattoo so I wait first
then masuk then I like cannot do ah later must take
is that is that correct memang ah
you're so cool bro chey memang lah
K jadi tattoo apa yang
koi fish eh koi fish tak habis eh
nanti kat atas it's a dragon tapi usually dia orang tak ada duit nak habiskan the dragon so it's just a koi fish at the forearm
I kena like tiga orang who have the exact same tattoo and they stop at the exact same spot
tak ada colour ah
colour mahal sia
apa sia
eh korang boleh maki tak
number one sakit eh later you like you tattoo yourself after that you pengsan macam mana
then just like later pengsan then the line like drag across across your body
you know like when you're writing ya but you're like in class then later tertidur youppo
apa berkam apa sia
macam tattoo
it's like test test dulu ah
cause the gun is going in and out it's very fast so you tak rasa sangat
or like you rasa for a shorter amount of time cause it's masuk keluar masuk keluar
well with the hand one it's like the person cucuk one by one slowly I'm sure it's gonna hurt more
you tau ah I lagi sikit I bila I went to mexico kan
I lagi sikit
ya ah I already cari the kedai already I asked one of my friends there when I sampai like which one like which kedai this kedai bagus or not then he said oh ya ya this one dia ada kawan pergi something like that and then after that
baru nak book appointment already when I was there
habis my dad dia kata oh cause before that my dad got the kidney problems one then he didn't want to let me or my sisters donate our kidney
my dad dia ada kidney problems
ya so at that point of time dia tak bagi kita orang donate our kidney
I I I don't need to take care of my body what cause I got nothing to lose so I baru nak eh I baru nak err book appointment habis
the night bila I was about to book the appointment my dad messaged his kidney were like lebih teruk then after that he said like then I told him lah if you want the kidney I can give then he said okay can
habis bila balik I bilang kakak then I was like oh I I I almost got it then after that she marah ah mampus sia no ah
call me bodoh all then I was like correct ah bodoh but
her friend is like her age semua dah tua
ya they know lah like I balik pukul berapa
another time at the pukul empat pagi dia jumpa aku tengah muntah dalam toilet
cause she said dia kata pe ah
if your sister finds out she'll kill me so neither of us are gonna tell your sister cause I tengah muntah muntah dalam toilet dia muntah rabak
err unless kakak telah bayar then yeah
I don't know ah I I don't minum anymore not since I met amira
she call me kentang
wait then like she asked me ah macam dulu I buat apa then I told her like all those benda bodoh bodoh like like you know like people
like conventionally when people go clubbing and stuff right like they like fuck boys ah like later they cari perempuan or what
bila I pergi clubbing in with all my friends
all I did was just make a nuisance of myself like joget joget I panjat pokok
ya I panjat dua pokok satu lamp post
when I balik station
cause that that time was like a rohtak outing the entire rohtak you know because no then after that the next day shift I balik station
then I masuk the office jer then after that everybody was calling me eh peter parker peter parker then I was like huh apa sia
and then after that my friend told me like oh kau tak mabuk kau panjat pokok habis after that like the this lah she was the one yang like jaga me because she don't drink then they know like I'm a handful
so like she turned around like she couldn't find me then she turned around then she saw me climbing the pokok then she's like ah turun then I was like no go away I'm peter parker and after that I started climbing higher
ya then nasib baik sia but it's
so ya like I I satan satan tapi bodoh
not not like the not like the creepy satan but the bodoh satan
aku nak aku nak pergi nak pergi jumpa kawan kawan eh like then after that kita tengah joget joget so usually when I go
like clubbing and K I'll go with my friends and then after that we just joget joget together like just guys it's just like playing around by ourselves then after that at one point of time there was this group of girls
also happened to be there and then after that they like trying to like like my friends all like ikut dia orang ah
I sendiri
and after that this girl came up to me then after that she like started macam joget depan I
and after that I pusing belakang then I was like eh bodoh sia lah sempit sia and then I the girl then I they all were like what the fuck sia
kesian the girl tak buat salah sia kena
marah ya sia
hose testing tu apa like you just turn on the thing ah
oh dah buat salah sekarang buat baik pula
baik hati ah
merepek sia
what time you balik
ya okay lah that's not too bad that time my last reservist cycle fell like turun
tujuh setengah kan
and then after that I I didn't turn out for call I malas so I tidur I tidur in like the they have like a mass hall but atas ah on the second floor then the office on the first floor
so every all the everybody else tidur on the first floor and then I tidur on the second floor
habis naik atas like pukul satu pagi then I was like eh ma'am I I go sleep first ah then she like oh K K I see you upstairs
bangun pukul sembilan pagi sia
when I when I went back into the office sia lah semua day crew and then they all like eh you this shift what why you come late then I was like no encik I night shift sia
ya pukul sembilan bangun
then after that nak kena sign out kan the reservist nya attendance sheet
night shift nya semua paramedics dah balik then I was like eh encik macam mana sia then he's like ah never mind I sign for you I sign for you
takkan nak begitu sia lah
balik on the dot sia
orh me and my friends selalu keluar eat breakfast lah so we leave we leave late but it's because we wait for the rest of the medics balik station ah
one time we naik basikal
and then after that my friend like we all cycled halfway already pergi entah mana nak makan lah or something then my friend kata eh sia lah aku tertinggal aku ni barang ah
then after that we cycled back and then we masuk the station like bicyle then we parked the bicycle outside the paramedic office beside the pumper macam
habis dia orang keluar then after that the suay suay the is like oi bicycle siapa ni then I was like encik encik bukan saya punya bicycle
eight bicycles like parked beside the siapa tak bingit sia
twenty percent a quarter of them ah dapat shock
no most of the time if dapat shock it's usually on scene and then it continue in the ambulance
so the pulse dah balik ah
no no when was the last time the patient like dia orang sampai dia dah dah gone kan so like how long before that did they last see him
orh like depan mata ah
kadang eh the
when I went back reservist the medic told me sekarang they make it compulsory sia
kena like you you have to have the my responder app
then after that sekarang dia orang enforce like you have to download
then after that if you dapat the notification kena pergi ah I mean if you tak nampak then bo pian lah but
apa lagi case err the community responder was
habis the this the this captain the the dia dulu macam medical officer
habis my my kawan nampak dia tengah belakang was like belakang selalu macam lepak lepak ah
then after that dia nampak the captain dia terus eh sia lah
my the the responder is captain ah then after that he told us macam
macam take charge of the scenes semua then I was like eh sia lah uar uar sia aku give kau lesson engkau buat bodoh jer macam tu
one of my last few duties ah like my err the most recent cycle I also got a cardiac arrest and then after that the like we managed to resuscitate sia resuscitate the patient dapat we gave like I think three or four shocks
but the nyonya was quite tua already
the dia orang dah tolong this nyonya out of the toilet then she terus collapse so like right from the mata ah then they immediately call
eh usually cardiac arrest kalau pagi pagi kan it's usually a macam orang baru bangun baru bangun then they jumpa the body then it's like dah beberap jam ah so that one
like the body without oxygen like after three or four minutes it's like permanently brain dead like let alone like how many hours right so that's why most of the time when you dapat cardiac arrest
tak boleh save ah
and kena buat betul betul lah that time apa lagi
err my last duty in like my last duty ever kena dapat call the this ah pek he cardiac arrest at a foodcourt
and then after that we sampai and then we saw the doctor there was a there was a clinic in front of the food court ah
and then after that like a the the passerby called the doctor then the doctor datang so when we reached the doctor was doing then the doctor buat you know like got a there's a pace one when you do it's like one and two and three there's there's like a certain pace you have to follow
then doctor buat macam macam jackhammer sia don't know what
macam begitu then after that macam eh pukimak ini apa sia ini rabbit pe and then after that my paramedic my paramedic tengah jalan
then lepas tu he he stopped walking then he turned he turned around he looked at me then he was like
sia lah dia buat apa sia then I was like betul in public K buat betul betul
the doctor the doctor buat sembarang then we after that we all like what the fuck sia the doctor you know
that's why like tak tahu malu ke like
like if you turn out for a cardiac arrest then you get like got two medics in the crew kan you will gaduh over who gets to do
you if you not doing means you have to set up all the equipment so you kena letak the lah the set up the set apa
buat the adrenaline kasi the normal saline then like all the small small stuff and then after that if you buat salah you kelam kabut you don't give it to the paramedic on time kena maki
so like everybody will gaduh over who gets to do
except for me I I don't like doing so I penat
I know my encik was the one who came up with the vehicles sia there like that was his project
I think ya tak salah I heard they got the thing for macam orang morbidly obese
cause the normal the normal alpha sekarang is fucking kecil sia like the old one like the box alpha you you remember right I think your time got the box alpha right
mm the ugly one but got a lot of space so that one like you put inside a fucking obese person also boleh
the new alpha is freaking sempit sia like a normal sized patient already like a slightly heavy normal size patient is already quite sempit already
plus the dengan the stretcher kan
like you don't need to angkat the stretcher like you just picik the thing then it's like mechanical then the the legs go up by themselves bodoh tak nak taruh in ambulance when we actually convey patients ke mana yang sedia
rabak sia
wait the the guy also a medic ah tu
actually ah the my last cardiac arrest case like bila balik reservist ni we also turn out with and then after that I nampak kan
so far dia orang asyik suruh the boy yang buat then after that yang lain semua diri kat keluar kesian sia
so like the so when comes the the ambulance crew like tak
like lepas tangan so we do all the other stuff like the medical the medical equipment ah like we put in the apa tubing semua
and then after that so like free up free our hands lah so the crew yang buat
and then after that like I tak pernah nampak anyone wearing orange bunker gear buat so far is selalu the firefighter
tak ah
what you all turn out pakai bunker gear pe
tak stress ah
oh then nasib baik sia nasib baik ada the fire fight
sekarang it's that's damn short sia so dulu dulu during my time kan the attachment was like two dua tiga tahun begitu
so like basically the whole and then semua turun then after that they take turns doing I don't know what the the the protocol is ah like I'm sure there's like some
ya so basically right the the people will do the and the alpha people buat the medical staff lah the semua
but then sejak COVID then they stopped because they want to limit like exposure or whatever
apa fire site
I get lah if you want to be ons but tapi ko nak kacau reservists buat apa sia
baru juga ah
double meaning tu apa sia
so it's basically covering the punya
oh so if turn out then you ikut if turn out also you ikut ah
oh rabak
rabak pe
penat ah
mana siap lah at least you dapat
last time tak ada kan your tak ada you get to face
a'ah mampus I I loh
then macam kawan pekik
the officer just bawa lah then he just continue
ya tak probably ah
but I already do two cycles tak pernah dapat sia the card terlupa
then tak pernah they never give
the no lah it's not like we go through the full benda lah cause we already know how to do it what so it's basically
and then they have the mannequin habis kena buat lah then they measure
I think it's just paper work ah so they like when you balik reservist then they said like oh we all got the cert already so we can turn out for cardiac arrest
was you ajar I
you taught me the hiemlich kat rumah atuk
I remember you that time you you masih botak I think you still in that time then you got to
and you keluar apa buka and and then after that you you told me right eh you know what I learnt or not then you started doing the hiemlich on me ajar pe
I had I had one this one time in got this one nyonya she said like oh I I'm choking
and then after that we sampai sia lah this nyonya fucking waste our time sia then she like mati mati she said like oh I can feel it in my throat I can feel it in my throat then we asked her what you eat she's like oh
that one is a different bodoh like if you are if you are actually choking you cannot talk but you should be able to sign if the person is right in front of you you confirm can like sign say you choking what
but like if you can berbual and tell the operator on the phone that you are choking then after that the the ambulance sampai
then you can buka the pin you can walk to the door buka pintu then you like oh I I choking just now I ate this nut I can feel it in my throat
I turned to my paramedic that time I that time I tengah ah so like my perangai already like like half fuck ah
then after I turned to my paramedic then after that he like I I told you macam cakap buang masa sia then after that my paramedic's like eh lain kan lain kan
then after that she takut then I was like then what the fuck you want sia
bingit sia
ya but I orang
my paramedic penakut so he convey
ya orh it's more of like he malas want to
ya she mati mati want to go
that one I bingit
like my friends all they say like oh sia lah they they malas want to turn out for like rabak punya call
but like I'd rather go for rabak call then the call is just waste my time
I mean macam ini kes bodoh bodoh sia then it's just like naik marah sia
got one time apa lagi this budak dia dia dia call ambulance dia kata like oh I I I tried to kill myself so we gotta rush down lah we thought like apa jadi
cepat cepat ah pergi
then we sampai already then we ask him what what what did you inject you tell us specifically so we like dia orang cari macam bleach bottle ke apa on the floor then he said oh I swallow this uh I swallow coins
the budak the budak call
or whatever then after that he complained complained complained then I was like no no no why you swallow the coins like you you want to kill yourself I understand why the coin then he like I don't know what to do then after that my paramedic marah me he's like eh abang kau tak boleh main main then I was like it's a legit question though what the fuck
ya after that my paramedic like he my my paramedic don't let me talk to the patient already he like kau duduk kat tepi kau main main
that one pecah nyawa nyawa on another level and that wasn't me there wasn't me that wasn't me I that one I tak berani the the kind of thing I don't play
ya then after that you baca
they they cari you cause you're the only one who can baca quran kan
like the where they simpan all the sets semua
he panjat
exactly pukul satu pagi sia why you telling me this now wah you fucking asshole
then dia orang tak dengar dia pukul pukul dia pintu ah

ada pekik kan a'ah
um kat sekolah selalu kena check in check out temperature taking semua
tak suka ah
nak minum air pun susah kena keluarkan mask semua
macam lek bro lek bro cuma nak minum air
a'ah kena kena nak kena sepak muka
oh oh did I tell you about kat sekolah kat sekolah kan got this girl dia macam irritating gila babi tak tahu
a'ah dia macam bites off macam gitu you know
dia macam tengok aku macam stare stare macam gitu
tak ada tapi like I I cakap dengan dia like tapi her vibes macam really off lah like dia macam suspicious dia macam cakap dengan aku like one way then she will go out and then she will talk to someone else another way
okay tapi kan like
I felt very petty lah tapi like um what's another like do you have any like macam petty reason
you like don't like somebody even though like macam
just met ke atau
macam Tinder ke muslim match ke
but it makes sense because macam like if you going to get to know that person
and then they they are like the way their vibes macam tak link dengan kau so it's very weird of course of course you would say no
kau gen Z
ya semua semua online
like orang can find like what they need to know about you through online social media semua tu
if you going to use normal you going to use a different name itu kan catfish
okay kau betul kau betul
kalau age lain sikit macam um please remove remove ah kan I mean as long as you're over twenty one so it's
macam mana okay ya paedophiles out of the way
technically it's a podcast cerita malam punya podcast kan
ya I guess that's like a pet peeve kan macam orang like lie about their age basically they fake their personality
ini what pet story ke apa buat pet story
huh makan um
makan Maggi bro a'ah
ya ya lah I lead the simple life senang sangat pe
aku makan mee gorengnya tak it's the

macam perangai perangai dah change ah macam gitu
alamak so sweet nya
alah macam gitu pun boleh alah
kenapa monyet monkey lah
dia kepoh ah jer
I know lah tapi macam third party terdengar
that's mean tak baik sia
alright makes sense it's okay you want clarification just as in secondary school sekolah menengah
who are like there to like support you kan so macam like if you if you find like friends who are girls then macam they just want to like
befriend you so they can get to know like your best friend or something like that tu salah macam salah sikit
but I think like like the karma that's going to be served to me but kalau
tapi kan if like if like karma were to like be served to me I think it will be like
dia cakap dengan aku like uh the way I
break up with people macam traumatising sikit
dia cakap macam sikit jer lah tapi
like revenge lucky revenge kan macam
oh okay for siapa
I will give karma back to him sia like macam
oh macam like he will say oh girls like perempuan tak boleh buat ni pe kena ada lelaki semua
ah ah ah ya ya ya macam gitu macam gitu tapi kan like I'm I feel macam
macam like you got nothing to prove
aku rasa because right I realise
if macam like
like some guys kan macam them they try to over like try to be overconfident
no because kan like kalau dorang macam like they get into a relationship with you then dia rasa macam okay
subconsciously dorang macam project their insecurities on to you
um does it's like whatever they are lacking then dorang macam insecure gila babi then they like ah macam mana I cannot
um tapi like confidence is good like in a person tapi macam tapi kan if you're like too overconfident then you are just macam hiding something then it should it like you're hiding something to the extent where you are actually projecting your insecurities on other people so please get therapy
please get therapy ya please get help because macam I macam I don't like the fact that macam some guys ada
because dorang macam live so macam insecure because of like maybe what somebody else cakap dengan them or like something that somebody criticise them or whatever and then suddenly they are like insecure for their entire life and then they like project it on to you and then now suddenly using that and then fuelling that anger and then they are like I'm angry at you because somebody said that I'm not tall enough something like that kan a'ah
I I I I will agree lah women are the same but I feel like macam like perempuan semua we are so like in tune with our own emotions then especially we will like in like a group of girls and then we're like very comfortable with each other which kita boleh blush out berbual banyak-banyak we can talk like this end to the other end like how we're doing in this conversation
macam podcast sia tak tau
I'm edgy I'm cool I'm so quiet oh my god macam sounds like me
um okay alah kesiannya oh no
even if you are just friends ke atau macam mata air semua you don't own anybody
macam overly clingy
to get kan duit susah
I just macam
kat padang padang killer yes oh it's farm
macam cartoon cartoon semua
specifically animation or animasi
ah tengah manifest
tengah manifesting sekarang tak boleh I'm trying to get it still
oh aku rasa
aku rasa they will macam
oh oh oh oh okay K K okay for my cat right for my cat gizmo kan he's a big cat dia kucing besar dia macam chonky so I think dia the personality macam macam chill laid-back macam nak lepak jer macam hmm a'ah macam lepak jer nak
nak makan tidur makan tidur macam senang ah
ya ah a'ah macam gitu macam gitu macam gitu macam abang bulat abang bulat nak cakap macam chill talks kat midnight ke
um probably macam I'll talk about my
two elders so gizmo's one of them and then like precious is the other one ya I feel like she will be low key macam
hidung tinggi a bit sombong sikit because she's very pretty she's very pretty
ya but tapi right I think she will be the macam queen bee very pretty tapi dia very macam
oh banyak sia
I got four other cats eh macam mana
alright okay then my other cats dulu dia nakal dia nakal banyak so like she's she's like those smallest
dia macam cili padi a'ah ya she's a cili padi I love her

like she got she got ya ya ya ya she got high she got high energy ah so sometimes dia macam like lari lari lari lari from left to right
ya ya dia lompat dia lompat like on the rack semua on the wall pun dia macam spiderman
but I think kan she'll be like macam
the sweet one tapi dia got probably dia ada social anxiety
cause dia takut orang
ya tapi sorang dia macam hyper gila dia macam takut a bit shy malu-malu ya then like got another one um her name is peppy
I found her kat bawah blok dia tinggal kat rumah tapi kan we found her macam wondering macam like a lost puppy
you know what I mean ya so ah tapi kan she sombong sikit dia macam precious
ya ya ya tapi kan dia tak suka aku I don't know my sister yang jumpa tapi
so macam sakit hati ya kan tapi like sekarang dia dengan dia like he he's like my mum's baby ah
she followed somebody into the clinic so I macam I just take her home lah bawa balik
like that ah I I brought her I bought a carrier just to bring her home can you imagine the love I have for this cat anyway dia for
for baby I think she's macam high energy dia macam lulu sikit
macam nakal macam cili padi pun she also small
macam she just she just want love and attention
so macam like ah I'll be at home like I baru bangun semua and then she and then she macam like she rub against me macam nak sayang I know I know yes

nine nine nine abang polis
sorry ah dogs are a bit macam susah
you need to train them macam really train them because macam kalau for cats kan like they can be a certain way kat rumah
but but sometimes macam you go to the vet clinic then they macam ganas ke they like to scratch around is normal lah because they're not comfortable mah tapi kalau dia kat rumah they're very comfortable they're very loving macam is so easy for them to like
they're not like dogs dogs kan you need to macam train them properly like okay here is where sit or like here is where you poop pee whatever

that's why otherwise macam
bro tak boleh lek lek pe

macam it's very bland it's like macam you you masak ayam masak merah but there's no merah
ya so so can we can we bring it back um I mean it's not it's been taken out but can we bring it into the society where we can normalise ayam masak merah with the merah

ya so the food there macam nasi lemak nasi ayam is like uh macam murah-murah kat sana it's like dua setengah like one satu satu satu setengah gitu so macam very murah then harga dia harga dia murah so err kalau tak sedap tak apa lah ya so that's what I had for my lunch yesterday
mm kat mana it's like bukit the bukit batok one

apa err is it nice
err maybe macam dah lama tak makan burger king
I went out for dinner with someone so kita err we went to try out this cafe at jurong east um the new cafe ah so yesterday dia punya uh it was its opening day um I forget what is the cafe called lah ya but it's near err area that that that jurong east area ya so uh when the food macam uh it's boleh tahan lah macam
um not the best not the best decent decent food ah so I tried err fish and chips err I tried fish and chips and err order also mushroom soup ah so the fish and chips macam apa tu uh boleh tahan lah macam lebih baik kalau it's apa tu lebih garing eh lebih garing ah and dia punya apa tu dia punya dia punya flavour eh
err is not my taste lah not my taste ya then their their mushroom soup is fine err macam terlalu salty for me ya
no the taste macam masin ah masin salty ah so I had err this tea called strawberry mango tea which is err interesting it taste it's just not bad lah it smells not bad the tea is like any other tea but the smell is good
err just to try out new stuff lor like he's a foodie so macam uh just go go around try new halal food see if it's nice in singapore there is not much halal options right so you just want to see see macam just take a look see see eat eat a bit here and there
we shared the food because err the err he he ate in the morning like before he came out so macam he's trying to I think he's trying to like do a bit of weight loss also lah cause he quite big size ya
twenty four hours so there's also a drive through kan ya so we we just it's a drive through ya so we just uh we went there for awhile just to macam have a bit of dessert lah macam so we we ordered like err two mocha iced mocha latte
ya I suka
ya so it was it was not bad lah macam it's uh is a bit uh ex apa tu a bit mahal and a bit uh sweet ya sweet tapi just sit down there macam just to berbual-bual jer lah berbual-bual talk about stuff
kat mana like how much
oh I think it's the mi Maggi one right mi Maggi noodles
tak nampak benda-benda halus eh
a'ah seh now now like uh sekarang tengah hujan right uh it's hujan semenjak pukul lima empat setengah gitu ah kan ya tapi macam dah it has it looks like the rain has subsided a bit so I think there might be a chance that we can play badminton at six
actually the weather now is like the best cause like macam it's mendung it's cooling
ya mendung err a bit sejuk and it's just nice weather ah
ya it will be hard to play badminton when it's too windy lah ya and if it's too slippery because right now the tennis court is a bit err it's like it looks very wet basah cause of the hujan
which is what you want teleport
so the is like a sci-fi movie where err the story is about this err boy who suddenly had the superpower to actually control technology from his mind ya ya so err it happened err sebab one day dia macam apa tu he got ambushed or got chased by a group of his classmates
so dia punya classmates I mean when the group macam ada
gangster gangster sikit ah ya so like even though they are very young the err they know they they they they can handle like dangerous stuff like pistol and drugs ya so that time uh macam dia tengah lari tengah lari from the orang kan abeh um one of them from the bad guy actually tembak
tembak the the guy so he hit the side of his head ah ya so because of that he went to a coma then the doctors said that there were actually fragments of of the phone err in his head fragments of a phone in his head ya I know I know I know it sounds stupid lah but ya this what is actually what the doctor said ya so because of that he actually got a superpower
err to actually um see whatever you're typing err whatever you are whatever you whatever you are conversing on your phone or whatever that is phone related lah and he has the ability to macam technology from his mind ya so is it got it got like err if you think about it right macam there's a lot of things you can do if you can control technology cause technology is everywhere right now in our society which I think is very cool lah very cool
ya cuma macam now that the movie is he is using his superpower for others uh for others for his own good and to help others lah I mean macam so he helped to track down the the culprits ah so the story was err macam apa tu uh this uh the neighbourhood is macam ada apa eh
macam ada is run by this err drug drug society drug a group ah like err ya so he helped to track this group down abeh macam help the police to do so he he use his technology macam to draw them in lah to expose on the drugs and dark secrets dorang ada to the neighbourhood and to the police
orh no no no no he's a middle school student ya he also has the ability to draw cash from bank accounts macam like err ya he can just drain your bank account just like that or also like err put in money into your bank account just like that so which is quite cool lah ya
ya ke oh is it that's nice oh he more like he targets the the gangsters society but dia macam he let them uh like he drains all of their bank accounts so that dorang tak ada resources
orh err usually for me I haven't been I haven't experience err any strong stereotypes by my peers or by my the people who I socialise with so I cannot really say much but I know that macam
there's always like err well known stereotypes err within the malay community err for example macam one very good example would be macam orang melayu tak pandai tak pandai in math gitu ya from young so and usually like err because like orang melayu suka macam lepak dekat void deck gitu so we are we are we are seen as like lazy people lor in a sense ya
which I think err palsu lah because like you as you grow up you will learn to take things on your stride then you will you once you find out what you like and then you will work towards it what it's the same for everyone cuma dulu is okay what to lepak cause like last time with your friends just chill chill lah like if if you like to me if your if your kind of lepak is main err like computer games or like
or like that kind then your our kind of lepak is really like is at the void deck lah chit chat yang main guitar ya so is the same kind of lepak lah I mean is just different kind of how you view lepak as
even though I do agree that err there's a smaller percentage of malay people who go to university but err to local universities but I know like there's actually a lot of my peers from secondary school who goes the poly then uni route so they still end up in a in a uni is just that they may have gone to err macam public uni ah I mean local uni or private uni but they still go to uni
in the end eventually ya I also have some cases macam after poly right they they err they do not wish to pursue university cause they already had their career settled back then macam if you look at err maritime studies kan err from poly err I think I got one friend yang macam he he he majored in maritime studies then right now he's always on the ship one
it depends on on on the direction or the career direction that you choose lah I think everybody has their has their special everyone has different talents ya what what they are good at what they are bad at ya macam gitu jer lah
lama eh it's very long
macam apa tu macam macam nak satu jam eh
subsidised subsidised heavily subsidised for public schools tapi when you talk about those non like err like we have certain schools in singapore yang macam the fees very expensive kan so usually like all the rich families will be able to go but not err for those families yang macam tak boleh afford lah because the fees are very expensive even like um macam if you want to join some of the you have to pay more
ah education is free for all especially when you when when we are talking about those lower income families yang macam or those like err families yang macam rumah tangga ada masalah uh mak bapa tak boleh beri uh tak boleh kasi apa tu uh apa tu tolongan pertolongan kepada uh apa tu anak-anak mereka so I think this is where it will be nice lah if the err those families uh those kids um can
you do lah but some people just need err err a bit of that push in the beginning I feel like uh macam some some kids they wouldn't even think about scholarship they are not interested because they don't even have the drive in them so if you show them or like if you give them a bit uh of like resources a bit then they will start to see orh this is the reason why we should pursue such things in school lah so that you can have greater access then
from there they will work towards uh macam striving to to get a scholarship
but you have to eat other people for meals dahsyat seh
you go kerja is it
ni hari today I wake up then I never do anything sia like I wake up right I wake up quite early but I got no school today so like I don't know what I

kita orang tinggal dekat singapore singapore bagus ada orang jaga ada orang kasi kita orang solat ya ke dia orang kasi kita pakai tudung dia orang tak we don't die just because we are muslims they we don't get shoot just because we are muslims

and then his pelamin is so pretty I love it
kat luar some function hall or something then my friend went to his wedding then I kaypoh kaypoh tanya dia kat mana
takde any spaces for children then like they will just run around and like that then orang akan marah and plus like it's a safety hazard for them because like there are food around hot things around and there are just so many people and so many tables around it's not safe for them so I thought
right if I were to have a children corner you won't see the bride on the pelamin ah you'll see the bride
dengan dress dia lagi
oh my god I was thinking of that tetapi kan tetapi eh tapi kan macam singapore's weather doesn't really allow us to do that

for me lah for me like kau nak
like kau nak kena work from home then kau kena go back office might as well just work from home kan because your job pun doesn't really require you to like
you know it's like very easy what you just err turn on your laptop and then duduk depan screen jer
but to be honest it's really very taxing because it's like you have to be there from like morning eight thirty usually lah my daily my daily apa err daily timetable will be like lapan setengah eight thirty then
kalau at most pun I will end about what five six kau imagine kau duduk in front of the screen for that one whole day
ya because for me kan aku macam
aku pun I I love to be honest I love to be at home but like to be at home
eh kau tahu tak actually kan sekarang the thing that we are doing now right aku feel macam deja vu tau aku feel like
aku pernah mimpi pasal this whole scenario serious I mean I mean now like what we are doing now
aku feel like deja vu sia ni
I will make it through lah as always dah nak dekat final year kan

macam very inspirational ah very motivational nanti dia macam dia kelakar like every time like dia dah habis dia punya whole exercise kan nanti last last kan bila apa ni cool down kan nanti dia kasih macam those motivational speech nanti isteri dia will be like apa jer apa jer budak ni buat cause like dia punya speech is good lah because dia akan cakap things like
err okay the fact that you have err chosen this err this this workout the fact that you have chosen this video means that err you know that macam you know he's trying to say that err macam well done lah because like kau err kau decides to do this workout
in a way macam well done so like he's trying to make us feel very motivated because after like cause dia orang ada macam the the workout varies tau dia macam ada forty minutes I think the the least is like ten minutes
after forty minutes kau feel like you want to die right
so actually his speech is really very inspiring macam kau feel like okay ya that's why aku take this this this whole
it was like six years ago but only recently macam dia orang famous I think
kau try ah one day ya
because recently okay aku tried macam the videos from six years ago and the videos lah recently
yang six years six years ago is like purely macam because I think dia orang just started out right so macam dia orang very err
very macam mana nak cakap eh macam very rigid very cardio cardio you know macam dia orang punya videos macam really okay thirty second nanti ada countdown gitu sekarang dah macam more chillax macam dia orang ada letak lagu
it's good lah macam kau joget and then lagu dia macam
so kau don't feel like you are actually exercising
ya especially now that you are working from home kau nak kena really seh have to make time
because aku just recently started doing the cardio kan then there's this whole whole week yang aku tak err felt well so I didn't do workout aku dia punya apa
dia punya exhaustion tu dia punya level of exhaustion boleh rasa seh because it's like
you know kau feel so tired then kau feel like macam lemah
you know so that's why aku rasa like you you have to like um
actually aku have this intention tau like every morning bangun
pergi jogging
ya but actually you macam we must tau because I mean you're not getting any younger and then like um
our health ni is really very important because recently I just bought a kau tahu yang the blood pressure punya monitor cause my mum few days ago dia sakit kan yang dia pergi doctor tu so she had like macam high blood pressure lah
it was really very high so macam mm the doctor suruh pergi suruh beli that machine to monitor so I bought bought from watsons
beli ah then the past few days we've been checking our
then err my adik punya was like
hundred and fifty like below hundred and thirty gitu macam normal lah then my adik cakap eh tak kak tak tak err it is normal for me hundred and fifty lepas tu aku macam are you sure your are you sure it's normal abeh dia cakap kak I'm fat then aku
ya so aku macam oh is it cause
for me kan aku aku don't really bother about this kind of thing tau to be honest
ya so aku macam recently aku macam fikir eh actually really seh I've been eating a lot of unhealthy food
and then kau tengok lah muka aku ni macam this pimple it's really a sign that says that I'm not I I feel like I haven't been glowing
you know and I feel so macam
very sucky like you know like macam kau
because you can you can really see from your your face tau kalau kau really glow you know that kind of thing so that's why aku these few days aku feel like err really seh I could really feel like I need to wake up in the morning and go for a jog
ya true that's why lah aku cakap aku aku aku feel like I haven't been taking care of myself lately ever since err start online learning ni
cause aku feel like
to be honest macam dulu aku malam-malam aku letak letak apa those facial punya benda ah serious aku moisturizer aku really very very very consistent sekarang aku dah macam
ah lantak kau ah aku really malas tau then aku sekarang
aku could feel so
menyesal ah aku really menyesal
hey you sure kau step jer you are saying this because you are my friend
eh no but I actually kan aku feel you should like makeover ah your room
no kau kena macam letak dari sana
but what colour was your light macam is it like the macam
but you also bought yang the the stars thingy right the constellation punya lampu
but tak macam
macam mana nak cakap eh macam kau tidur tak tak affected your sleep ke
bila kau nyanyi kan
tahu selalu nampak kau punya story
bila kau tengah aurora tu maknanya kau tengah nyanyi ah
kan kita kindergarten tak sama kan eh no sama
your kindergarten yang dekat sana tu kan
bukan oh your kindergarten kat gek poh
your kindergarten is under the punya kan
sama lah
but mine was like err near the pioneer area sana
or maybe tak lah maybe we met in err primary school
bila eh kita start
it's always like that macam kau bila kau in the same environment with the person kan kau tak kau tak macam close tau nanti kalau kau dah habis sekolah ke apa habis macam habis kerja ke apa kan nanti kau just randomly
pergi trip dengan dia lah pergi holiday dengan dia lah
ya I have that friend also like my this one ex colleague dulu macam like when I was working with her
kita tak berbual langsung tau because
aku like macam kirakan assistant dia executive lah different roles kan because that time I was still taking my diploma she was already like degree holder gitu so different roles so I was like in one office and she was in another room
kita tak kita tak rapat then after I left then like tiba randomly kita because like for me like after after I left right usually I will like add them on facebook or instagram
then dia
dia macam random tiba-tiba dia ajak aku like pergi the one the one that I went perth with
and then the funny thing is like aku pergi trip dengan not only her but also with her sister and then like so funny like kita tiga like considered like strangers but then like when we were at perth kita just clicked instantly tau
and then aku macam amazed because
it's just so macam orang cakap macam senang ah masuk
aku just be real dengan kau ah
kau tahu kan recently dia sakit
oh okay so it's really very way back ah okay okay so macam macam gini
dia sakit kan
it was err before he balik
okay so he sakit tekak and stuff like that initially we thought it was like because of him smoking
so I was like macam
err because he's okay not only his throat tau then he always has like macam ulcer
so we tried like natural remedies lah macam kasih dia minum like those um honey lemon kasih dia pakai yang kau tahu bonjela gel stuff like that
so he went back he went back home then err macam biasa kena quarantine and stuff like that then macam aku cakap dengan dia err you go jumpa doctor kat sana jumpa clinic kat sana cause first of all it's cheaper and and and kau at least like macam
err at least get to the bottom of it lah because if not you don't know what's happening kan because we've been trying natural remedies and then it's not working lepas tu dia pergi clinic kat sini pun
it's not working as well and then one thing aku geram pasal dia kan is that dia nak benda kan nak nak dia sakit dia nak cepat like instantaneously tau
abeh aku macam eh come on lah like kau nak baik needs time to recover kan but dia tak dia macam nak kau tahu macam makan ubat hari ni esok nak baik
where got such thing right so okay tu tak apa then he like err
but he balik
okay he balik then um he
he balik
and apa eh
he balik he went for doctor and stuff like that
the doctor cakap
err he has to go for like further check up dekat err specialists but it will take time
so right now he's actually on err renal diet ah renal diet ni macam um less salt less sodium less potassium kalau kau ingat aku aku kadang-kadang aku post dekat instagram yang gambar-gambar masak it was actually for him
I don't know eh macam sometimes recently aku feel like um
macam mana nak cakap eh okay you know I'm a very
err okay even though aku introvert kan you know I'm a very outgoing person adventurous person and stuff like that
and then when aku with him aku feel like aku
but emotionally because aku feel like
few months kan it's it's always been about him okay maybe I'm selfish but it's always been about him and then like aku trying
macam okay kau tahu aku sakit tangan
aku don't feel the support from him also
aku tak tahu ah macam recently aku feel like
apa eh nak cakap eh
dia cakap dengan aku ah he said um okay you know of my condition and stuff like that kan like do you still want to be with me
but at that point of time aku was in err in a dilemma because
you know how um because okay I don't want to be that kind of girl yang macam
bila kau susah kau takde tapi bila kau senang kau ada you get what I mean
mesti ada ups and downs kan I want to be that kind of person who who has always been supportive
okay and when he asked me macam do you still want to be with me despite my condition aku felt
guilty aku felt bersalah because macam oh because of his condition now abeh aku nak tinggalkan dia
okay aku aku aku aku rasa kadang-kadang aku rasa macam aku pun depressed ah maybe because of the previous relationship I think my ex really really broke me
yang tadi aku jumpa tu I was telling her I said that you know sometimes
if if I macam if I could turn back time sometimes I wish macam there are some exes yang aku shouldn't have let go
macam I should you know my yang the ex from err poly tu yang dia nyanyi tu
you know like macam I I want those kind of relationship yang macam
kind of destroyed everything and then like you know recently aku added him on err instagram and then like a few days ago ah no actually was yesterday I saw his instagram story and I was tempted to message dia tau
but aku macam jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan message jangan cari pasal
like aku nak text but aku macam telling myself not to
but to be honest there are some there are times where aku felt like
he wanted different things and then there was a third party which aku ni gatal sangat pergi melayan the third party was my recent ex
so that's why aku like when I think about this whole thing kan aku feel like macam
I shouldn't have layan the ex man I mean I shouldn't have layan that third party
because you know you know that that time err during one of my um poly friend punya wedding kan we met
aku lupa tau aku honestly forgot that he was the cause of the break up
then aku introduce macam tak bersalah gitu lepas tu because I only I didn't notice at that point of time I only remembered when I was looking back at my memory box because I have this memory box where I apa tu
cause dulu aku dengan dia okay lah a bit cheesy lah we we write letters to each other
ya he's that kind of guy and aku I'm a sucker for letters like to me it's very sentimental and we have those you know macam coupons that was my birthday like gift lah to him macam coupons macam
okay um redeem this to get a free dinner ah macam redeem this to get a free massage ah macam gitu you know
there's this book that I wrote tau aku dengan dia tulis err tak kita macam okay kau tahu macam paper kan lepas tu kita macam gunting then kita macam staple lah tepi tu macam make it into a book so we wrote down like
things that I dislike about you serious things I like about you err what do you want to change in this relationship then macam appraisal
ya so so we did that so we did that then um apa ni err
I oh he wrote down that person name so like recently kan aku look through kan then aku realise oh my god he hated this person so I was like
and then I introduce them then aku was like oh my god what ya then I was like what did I do you know no no wonder okay lah because you know you know you know when a person is looking at you kan
I mean my ex yang best friend tu
err he was looking at me and then from dia macam dia tengok kan abeh kalau kau tengok dia tiba-tiba mata dia macam
I don't know because okay lah recently okay aku be honest with dengan kau eh
ya online through err because kita friends again what on instagram
I tried to like macam talk to him and stuff like that but
err a conversation into me lah macam with me so macam dia
macam kita berbual then after that nanti kadang-kadang dia just seen tak reply gitu so macam so aku macam okay lah but
because I was thinking about it lah cause you know two of my exes aku came back to them right two of my exes and then it didn't work out what kan
then I was thinking kalau if I were to get back with this ex kan
like I remember merepek gila ya allah I don't know it was like macam I think it was after his performance or something
okay I can't remember but I remember this one part where kita naik tau he was sitting at the two seater seat and I was sitting at the long seat tu
abeh dah sampai buona vista eh was it buona vista
so I just left keluar gitu I just left like that
and I just leave him dekat seorang seorang and
I recently yang we got back I mean not we got back like I added I mean added him on err instagram kan ya ya he followed me back so
err aku dia
aku told him lah okay actually it was very funny because aku
can I be honest I say ya sure sure lepas tu dia cakap
err you are a very sensitive person gini gini semua abeh dia cakap um it's better kau boleh tone down sikit kau punya err sensitivity but I was reading it and I was triggered
you know macam you don't tell me not to be sensitive but okay lah aku appreciate his err feedback
tak actually seriously dia dia baik tau because kan um but dia pun sayang aku
baik lah cuma aku jer shitty
that's why aku
that's why I said tadi ah I was telling myself I said you know if I could turn back time
actually kan aku rasa kalau aku tak break up dengan dia kan aku rasa kita dah ada anak seh dah kahwin because kita okay lah ya in that book right we actually wrote err when to get married and stuff like that we actually plan to get married when kita twenty seven tau twenty seven years old so kau imagine
or at least two kids seh ya so sekarang macam aku dengan dia both
plans pun tak work out
I mean I've been wanting to do that actually but I just telling I was just telling myself like jangan main gila jangan main gila
but I think aku dream about him because I've been looking at his instagram story
err that time I found out he just putus tunang actually he's a very private person tau because that time he tunang then he didn't post his tunang face
so it was like dia tunjuk okay ah okay err yang gambar ni aku tak tak nampak because back then aku tak follow him yet but it was my friend lah who showed me that picture so it was like just a picture of a bouquet of flowers and a ring so ya lah to show that you know dia dah tunang
but recently yang kita met back tu at a wedding
aku aku random ah aku tanya dia eh mana tunang kau
oh dia macam oh err takde ah
then that's when I know he dah putus tunang
but I don't know whether he's seeing anyone or not because takkan aku nak cakap dengan dia eh kau seeing anyone ke tak you know like
actually macam aku fikir balik kan it's amazing how I remember all my exes punya birthday
kan aku I don't know what's wrong but I remember his birthday so I was thinking like mm maybe ada ada ada ada tu eh
mm ada lah end of january
ya so we'll see lah we'll see maybe maybe I will just like ask him ke like hey wanna grab a coffee
okay nanti nearer to his birthday kau remind aku this ah
because aku takut I will ask him the question instead
ya hopefully hopefully because like macam next year kan dia dah turn thirty kan
ya so like bila dia turn thirty tu orang cakap wiser a bit lah it's like throw away your twenties and then start thirty with something new
eh nanti kan dah habis just tekan yang tick tu tau
lepas ni I can't wait to eat our sushi
how can you forget dia kat depan jer seh
okay lah jap lagi lagi berapa minit jer actually it's like what almost it's only it's like one minute left seh

tapi in tapi in uh dalam hati it's actually kita semua macam
ah macam mana uh best

hotel mana hotel mana you tinggal
oh uh oh kita tinggal hotel ni ni ni ah
you tak tahu ah itu hotel ah
um dulu ah saya punya bapa uh sudah uh uh apa ni
sembahyang kan dengan uh orang-orang uh orang-orang
ahli yang lain so what she was trying to say is that that hotel was known to be haunted where people actually killed themselves and know do ah they they hang themselves okay technically they kill themselves inside the hotel there were a lot of like scenarios in hotel so what the hotel did was
dia ah panggil uh ustaz buddha ah ahli-ahli ugama
untuk sembahyang kan the bilik to uh to sembahyang kan the hotel the blessed bless the hotel
speaking of orang kaya
ah okay kita
tapi kita selalu dengar macam uh macam kita dengar benda lah
okay bilik kita bilik hujung
okay the okay bilik the hotel is famous the hotel is very big
we find it strange cause we said but we didn't even mention cause you know how orang orang tua cakap mulut jangan celupar bila kita dekat tempat tu
leceh seh
kita okay kita dah bawa keluar semua tilam
we still when when we we kita share when kita kongsi story uh cerita ni dengan um
the shopping mall is just down bawah
ya you told me about your kakak
ya but your kakak cause your your kakak dah tidur
ayah dulu first kerja ayah kerja apa
wah kalau gitu ayah kerja lama seh adik tak boleh imagine seh kalau macam kerja lama gitu
sampai about how many years eh ayah kerja dekat alfa laval
sekarang nak cari kerja dua puluh tujuh tahun hais macam tak pernah dengar seh ah
so bila ayah kerja dulu dekat uh alfa laval then you don't think macam maybe there's a better job out there or something like that
memang dah planning kan dah kan
so ada apa yang macam very interesting tak yang dulu bila ayah kerja kat situ apa dia punya mesin ke like the machine dia style tu
tak ayah cakap tadi dia pakai apa sledgehammer
yang the the like the big punya sledgehammer itu ah
wah kira kan bagus seh pakai allen key jer senang seh
nowadays macam actually banyak like really a lot of things dia orang nak tukar
jadi macam manufacturing kan even macam sekarang
like now my workplace macam construction ah pun semua pun dia orang nak tukar jadi macam manufacturing
ya ya ya ya actually true ah so macam dia orang ah actually dia orang nak buat kan benda tu ah datang jer kan
terus terus in place and then they tie something and then that's it finish ah
ayah rasa the houses eh because now they actually want to do a house
ah yang pagar kayu tahu the whole you imagine eh macam the whole building
mm actually kalau macam they use wood kan dia orang cakap ah it's supposed to be cheaper because ya
because like uh the wood banyak tapi macam macam uh the besi is steel kan dia orang kena mine
ah so that's why like uh kalau kayu kan senang dia chop jer lepas tu dia dia process
kan cepat habis dia punya plank tu banyak
sekarang macam dekat dalam news kan dia kan ada banyak cerita macam climate change ayah dengar tak cerita ni
macam dia cakap oh dia ada ah perubahan alam
ah dia ada tukar macam oh ada tempat ni kadang kadang mula mula ah you know there's a lot of snow then suddenly eh tempat tu tak banyak snow
oh yang itu ada ah
so kalau macam ayah
ayah rasa yang ada perubahan tak over the years eh yang in singapore do you feel any changes or not
in the udara ke or anything like that
so ayah rasa macam tak apa ah kalau dia lagi banyak shopping centre then
this climate change tu kira kan boleh boleh adapt ah
tapi ah so far ah ayah tak tahu anybody yang got this COVID right
so ah pada ayah macam yang this ah COVID ni ah ayah think will last how long
tapi dia orang cakap mm dia orang cakap mula mula it comes from china kan because like dia punya china tu dekat situ kan
dia orang ada dia orang they like to eat a lot of like macam weird weird punya animal tahu
oh so macam ayah fikir actually what the government want is to make to ensure that people will continue working
ayah baca tak yang there's this uh group of people kan yang dia orang army plane habis lepas tu dia orang
ah dia orang fikir oh never mind lah because it's a private plane habis dia orang turun kan lepas tu yang eropah punya
the europe punya people say eh ah don't come because you're from ah please go home
ah ayah baca tak
oh ya dekat dekat eh the inside of the dormitory kan it's really uh it
according to my workers ah dia orang cakap kalau kau daripada ah but unfortunately lah kirakan kalau you're from china eh yang the
bangladeshi and the indian worker right don't want to mix dengan yang chinese because dia orang cakap tapi memang betul dia punya hygiene level is very low so
they try to okay I want to stick to only my people ya tapi sekarang is like tapi of course in the news I think singapore they don't want to say which
place or which type of which race is the one that is get a lot of the uh sickness because if not then people will be very macam macam racist kan dengan dia orang ah pasal tu dia orang pun tak nak ah actually
do you remember the SARS actually not so bad kan macam aku I I I don't remember cause I I was actually in like early like secondary school and then ya
oh is it abang abang punya party
oh the the khatam quran party is it
oh I don't remember kena check temperature actually
oh dah boleh clear ah
tapi ayah rasa like is this COVID right is it the worst thing that happened to singapore or actually ada benda lain in yang ayah ingat ah that is the worst thing than this COVID
so uh apa tu jadi if now eh bila ayah tengok macam movie movie macam zombie zombie kan
ah ayah continue tak tengok cerita macam itu sekarang kan now you feel like you're already in the movie
ada cerita yang paling takut tak what story is like super takut yang ayah ingat sampai sekarang ah
tapi that cannibalism is not even fake seh it's not it's not like zombie
but in the story kan dia orang macam cepat gila kan like the they the they run you know
orang hantu apa seh itu
oh so you're actually like actually the actual human yang human yang betul lagi lagi takut daripada
so macam hantu biasa macam ah you can just
walk away ah katakan
tapi kirakan sekarang ayah dah retire kan so ayah rasa freedom tak macam
I I don't need to care about like all this you know hantu or all these you people
so ah apa tu jadi bila ayah dah retire so after dah you retire you feel like
do I really need to go back to work ah macam gitu
so ah apa itu bila dulu kan ayah
um mula mula start kerja then you said that the kan ayah ada kerja kat tempat glass kan
ah so dulu dekat singapore dia ada banyak factory eh pasal I don't think sekarang ada company glass dekat singapore
dia punya cerita semua sama eh kena retrenched ah
macam kirakan fated ah
so sekarang kirakan macam free and easy
ah then everyday bangun and then just macam
uh buat itu ah uh if there's planning today then just buat jer lah gitu
so ayah rasa macam hidup gini all the way till the end okay ke tidak
so kalau actually eh macam sekarang kan dia banyak gila technology kan
ah ayah rasa technology ni kirakan macam bagus ke tak bagus kadang kadang macam technology ni macam
susah kan nak cakap
dulu ayah favourite subject apa eh like when in school lah
so bila ayah when you read kan those kind of stories kan do you feel macam actually bila dia jajah satu country tu dia bagus ke um good or bad
so bila dulu uh kan yayi is actually malaysian right
oh yayi
oh actually so pasal tu nyai will come to singapore
so tapi yang that time yang yang yang apa tu the the separation kan
dia dia announcement ke apa
so it was actually senang gila seh
oh so actually you got lucky ah kirakan
so actually macam ayah pun tak march sangat ah kirakan
actually dulu pun like when I first err fikir kan like what to do kan actually I also wanted to join uh the army
because like the army macam to me macam dia semua macam easy ah kan
ah then lepas tu you you you can rise up the rank and then kerja dia macam not so bad lah
tapi aku tengok macam orang kat dalam army pun macam apa tu stoning kan dia orang ikut the rules and then
ah macam pelik kan it's like what what what's it for ah but I mean I can maybe understand lah dia orang semua nak untuk buat
like you're disciplined tapi there must be other ways to be disciplined also right
macam somehow dah kau dah kau dah tak dekat dengan situasi itu suddenly everything macam not so bad
quite positive kan ah macam oh you can remember the good times ah
ah it it like life is like that kan macam dulu like apa tu err that time when the adik dalam police eh oh my god sia
like so hot and then lepas tu dia punya push up don't say ah
ah dia punya push up dah apa tu wah sekarang sekarang nak buat push up macam gitu pun tak boleh seh tapi dulu wah you know so good you know
ah and then lepas tu dia orang and then dia punya army officer semua cara dia sama kan
ah dia
muka kirakan semua macam yang itu ah yang kak inah tak minat
so macam dia orang semua nak kena they have this macam angkuh punya muka ah eh
ah tapi tak tahu ah maybe it's just not fated ah that I you know that I didn't join the army ah forget it sia tengok
a'ah tapi bagus juga seh kalau hari hari pakai uniform senang seh like you don't need to think you wake up
ah so macam kawan adik sekarang dia dalam MINDEF kan so like although he's in construction eh
dia nothing to do with him you know eh whatever that happen outside eh dia macam oh okay
macam MINDEF kan is very big so kalau dia orang if there's anything eh dia orang nak kena buat
ah in within the MINDEF itself ya dia orang mesti nak ada manager yang kat dalam yang boleh buat construction
macam ya like no feeling to scared ke takut ke kena buang kerja nothing ya
tapi ayah dah err I mean like I you speak to them sekali sekala ah at least
apa sal ada banyak secret ke
so mesti kerja yang rabak rabak punya then uh too bad lah because like you're in warehouse pe
actually ayah dulu ada license apa eh
ayah ada license forklift kan
ya lah macam wasted money ah pasal call crane
ah lah pasal macam sama ah macam construction kalau ada crane masuk kan it's like oh my god seh
like dia orang semua like you cannot even walk there and then ya
ah actually servicing kebanyakannya is really buang habuk
dia dia buang habuk jer lepas tu nanti is if if really something wrong kan
ah dia cakap ah change part jer ah semua
maybe pun tak gerak seh pasal there's not much things kan sekarang
ya so sekarang macam the situation dengan si COVID ni is a bit weird kan pasal banyak benda macam just stop
pun pun tak ada banyak orang pakai apa sekarang kan macam like ke apa tu yang the funny thing is that yang adik berbual dengan kawan adik ah habis kawan adik cakap buat apa nak beli baju baru seh
ah is aku I don't even use the baju half of the time in pyjamas macam I pergi kerja pun pyjamas ha
dulu kirakan macam so bila ayah dah masuk warehousing tu then lepas tu like you didn't bother to go back to the shipyard lah kirakan
ayah tak pakai itu ke umbrella
so it's like macam after you get out kan macam lain gila kan macam
itu ah kerja actually macam technical officer is actually pretty ah dia dia actually quite senang
a'ah so itu ah so tengok ah maybe adik pun will just become a technical officer ah
pasal kau if like you kerja all the way construction
is like lagi senang nak check orang punya kerja kan daripada nak buat you punya kerja sendiri
ah itu lah dia tapi actually sekarang kan dia orang banyak yang ah banyak
dia orang suka just berdiri and then suruh orang lain buat they don't want to go down themselves
itu yang masalah dia ah itu yang banyak yang macam singapore punya manager ah yang susah
I mm so you're saying like dia tak tahu ah actually
actually that's true ah itu yang dia punya the difference kan I think we talk about this before yang macam if you work for a
ah if the kalau dia punya engineer turun kan daripada australia ke apa then kalau kau tak turun dengan dia kan
ah then dia macam tengok engkau hello I'm going down sia you not going down meh gitu a'ah
ah tapi kalau macam singapore punya wah clean ah berdiri jer kasi yang the poor bangla eh ah
a'ah tapi tu tapi sekarang bangla semua pun tak ada
pasal sekarang pun dah ah semalam I met my friend

tapi apa tu ayah ayah tengok tak yang macam yang dekat america banyak orang tak nak pakai mask
tapi pelik kan I don't know why macam dia orang err apa tu really really go against err apa tu dia ah nak pakai mask ni padahal pakai mask tu macam tak ada apa apa per
ah I don't know ah when when is this going to end pun really not sure
ya so tengok ah apa tu harap harap everything is okay lah kan
so tak tahu ah tengok ah macam mana habis mummy tak cakap apa apa ke
yang pasal yang macam COVID ini ke apa
ayah ada berapa banyak seh
wah dah dah dah planning ah
chey pasal dulu kan apa tu kan susah kan nak dapat singaporean
ten years tak boleh masuk malaysia apasal eh
so is apa untuk tunjukkan like you're patriotic ah kirakan
oh so dia dia really macam nak uh apa tu
tapi kalau macam if you go back kalau then you must take some some
letter ke atau pun macam tak atau they just tak tak tak consider you as patriotic ah
oh so kirakan macam apa tu dia dia really control lah ya
mm habis nyai is nyai singaporean
so dia bila dia convert seh
oh on the independence day itself dia boleh convert tapi apasal ayah tak convert
macam there is something ah to show like you really want to be a singaporean lah
bila ayah first uh cakap that pledge eh tapi ayah ayah sekolah pun kat singapore so it's not that hard lah
ah yang itu actually adik pun kena buat lah benda tu oh zaman zaman silam kan a'ah
okay baik okay let's start the things macam how's things on your weekend
ya I mean tadi ya I had to wait for my wife come back cause she just now in the afternoon you know my my kid dia tidur all the way so my wife ingatkan dia can go to the hairdresser and then just relax kejap lah
you know just have a relaxing hair trim err hair wash and then go for a relaxing massage and all that err because today is the last day of her annual leave of two weeks so she wanted before balik kerja eh jadi dia nak
dia nak one whole day just pamper sendiri saja lah so let her be and then by the time she came back then like this ah just nice also you err you also jadi to do all these things ya so K lor so everything's all right so far I think it's a peaceful day
err while I was also thinking whether we want to discuss regarding our tournament punya benda
exactly ya ya that's my idea pun I was also thinking about that actually
ya so ya I also err not been discussing my guys err all those you know my my my guys who I've been consulting with lah err those that were in the semua tu
so dia orang kata you know like is it they worry about that what exactly what you said how what is you know how will we get the sponsors to come when kita takde benda you know like you you there's no real cove lah
like everybody knows kita punya reputation tapi takde takde portfolio in this this sort of thing so they will also thinking why not maybe you hold a weekly event dulu
the weekly event and then just nice err earlier this week ada there's a league that is there's a new league a one V one that kicked off so dia punya format eh sixty four teams or sixty four players thirty percent of registration fee jadi first prize
fifteen percent the registration fee second prize five percent registration fee third prize so kalau kalau all sixty four players masuk dalam
prizenya tak banyak it is seriously tak banyak actually so the total registration fee will be it's ten dollars per person jadi the whole prize pool eh baru apa enam ratus six hundred and forty
six hundred forty dollars so thirty percent of that the champion is only gonna get tak sampai dua ratus dua ratus dollar pun tak sampai it's like one ninety one ninety two something like that and only the top three players get and this is supposed to be a league jadi kena main each other for like
so that's at least thirty two or sixty four matches jadi a a lot of the the response of the company semua tak nak main it's like eh it doesn't make sense ya it's only ten dollars tapi you know like it's nak you you enter that
only top three dapat menang apa-apa and then even the prize will not that great it's that it's not like one K or few hundred dollar it's just like not even dua ratus so banyak orang you know the dia orang tak suka lah all this thing ah so I was wondering but
maybe let's say like of the registration fees kan ninety percent these guys only did like not even half ah what is thirty plus fifteen plus five that's our forty five percent tak sampai setengah of the total registration fee so why not have we do something like that but for a one weekend thing only
or even one day just have one day saja and then err we have like a a what a tournament which we will cast fully we will make everything on our own because we can cast ourselves err ya and we can have it as as relax as possible no need to be so err what's that called
um so serious because we are our own clients apa
so you know there's kita we can just like borak have fun you know and then let the committee come in and then tell them ah look this is you guys gonna pay ten dollars okay but the more the more people there are the bigger the the the the prizes
and the winner is not just gonna go back with less than two hundred dollars ah because the prize pool we're going to have it like ninety percent we'll just take ten percent of the carts just for our time saja lah so even was at six hundred dollars let's say okay let's say we enter it at ten dollar
I I I entah eh I also don't know how many people have resgistered tapi the the response I get banyak orang semua semua kutuk ah critics semua kutuk top top white center
now semua kata you know ni apa apa benda what kind of nonsense is this you know buat apa kita main buat apa I mean we play so much habis duit sikit saja then kena main lama lama how many weeks ya lah ada better things to do ah than to just stay around and play FIFA like that for for nothing at all ya
no tak tak tak nampak lain ah ada apa eh let me see kalau ada league there's a link here ya it's a facebook page
namanya D to sports league entah siapa I langsung tak pernah dengar aku tak pernah dengar dia orang punya ni tapi ada nine hundred plus members kat dalam
let's see ada tak berapa berapa orang dah sign up tak ni tak nampak pula eh
tapi nampak macam masih buka jer masih boleh sign up jer
a'ah berapa orang
ah belum tahu ah berapa orang ah kat dalam
tapi ya so this is one thing I saw where I noticed somebody's shared this on this err whatsapp community group page for FIFA in singapore so semua orang kata like
so there wasn't even any one they say alah just go for the fun of biar jer langsung takde orang say that semua semua kutuk okay I'll I when I say semua eh it's literally there only like three people that response ah that responded
yang lain semua you know buat buat tak kisah saja
ya this this this D to D thing it's just like a cash grab ah dia orang just buat ni benda just err make a few posters bilang semua okay eh aku ada league ah you know you get thirty percent kalau kamu menang you get thirty percent
tapi fifty percent of all the registration fee goes to the creator and they barely have to do anything benda senang I think there's just one guy doing everything it's a good business idea but it's a little bit
macam gray macam makan makan makan sendiri ah makan all the community
in terms of like I say getting the players I have no doubt we can get more than fifty players at one go that's that's definitely for sure even if it's just a one off event semua kan minimum or I think we can do a uh forty a thirty forty players so takde issue langsung ah
itu pun susah juga kan so I'm so I'm thinking at least kalau kita have a league a weekly league system thing then it will just err macam mana kata eh
every week ada content baru that we can we can put in and there's a there's a linking story between each of these different weeks
actually nak kata possible eh
it actually is possible actually because you need okay let's let's take everybody at once ah actually nak kata registration fee selalunya berapa
because they're by community centre budget no problem untuk dia punya wang actually it's free registration dia orang tak payah bayar apa-apa
so it's just my masuk lah kan but that's for the punya lah um ya but even then I still believe you know people should pay a nominal amount and also that they will be they will come down and play juga then noticed we won't have so many buys and stuff like that lah
tapi for all the events um what ah who ah they don't really need to recoup anything whatsoever they just dia orang just bayar bayar bayar jer so takde registration fee takpe juga untuk dia orang ya but for us we add in lah as much as we want to we are we are okay with
uh how do I say ah ya we need a way to pay or displays but but I at the same time I don't want to have a registration fee that's too high and then people will think alamak one day registration fee sepuluh ketul and then who knows you know like I play one game and then I'm out
I'm thinking what we can definitely though okay put it this way err let's say registration fee let's say lima ketul lah I I can definitely okay
the more people that join your prize pun naik gila babi
uh one hundred sixty dollars time zero point zero five that's eight dollars back you win one match kau dah menang tiga dollar
ah duit datang balik tau all you need to do is win that first match you going back eight dollar you pay me five dollar win one match I pay you eight dollars back
dah eighty percent eh a'ah sia tu dah banyak juga tu
soon lepas tu kalau dapat masuk to the semi final top four ah
err so five percent each lima peratus satu orang lima peratus okay naik top four
ah kau dapat sepuluh percent lah sepuluh peratus ah
correct so you masuk kalau you masuk quarter final sudah dapat five percent you masuk semi final you get ten percent
you masuk final up to fifteen percent
err mana percent yang
kejap eh so that's twenty percent plus okay and then the next four eh the next two okay four winners get twenty percent total alright naik four two will drop out now they get ten percent each so that's another twenty percent of the prize pool dah removed
two were good carry on the second place get fifteen percent the last place get twenty percent all by itself so that two four six seventy five we are still within we are still within err apa tu
correct correct we can even up the champion to thirty percent pun boleh thirty percent of the total prize pool
matchmaking pun susah ah ah ya so so that's the thing ah then the list uh ya uneven
ya eh kalau tak some people get a buy then they get their money back eh that's not fair juga eh
thirty two fairly I think eh no problem senang
senang ah senang
ah tu ah
I have okay like even without all this this new tournament thing kan I have another place to pitch our original league idea too but I've been holding it off um so that hopefully we can get our own uh third party sponsors ah takde orang akan kacau kita lah
falls the one that is working with SCOGA ah cause dia pun dah dia sendiri nak buat community events sendiri juga
my understanding is that he has his own production punya house or something like that
and I think at this his if we go to him for sponsor or whatever like that kan we telling him that eh looked operations side kita semua dah settled everything kita dah dah fikir masak-masak and kita boleh you know bawa orang-orang confirm register punya
you know tapi the one problem kan that I can see is that if we'll go to him to look for sponsors that is definitely basically is a SCOGA event or is a SCOGA sponsored event SCOGA duit no problem this is definitely their alley they were one more err jet ideas
that is what N nadesan has been saying ah kalau duit anything with money ke apa kan with gaming related SCOGA budget no problem that sounds SCOGA can afford kita
tapi so that's that's the thing ah we will be working you know like uh together with SCOGA it won't be our event eh technically it will be our event but will have their name on it as well
semua ya cause ya they have SCOGA but I remember they also it's it's almost like zenway lah actually ya supported by SCOGA supported by zenway but organised by you know like ah people association entah apa community club lah sports club
south west ni semua so it's it's it feels very zenway like
ya even this err apa dia E delta league
I don't know macam mana dia orang nak buat aku pun tak tahu lah eh tapi organised by singapore police force national crime prevention council
supported by tote board pizza hut blah blah blah venue partner sports up oh okay so it's gonna be an offline event ah kirakan ah kalau venue partner dah sports up tapi it's um ah you know like um it's again ah
so basically SCOGA eh in my opinion how they've been running all their events kan sama macam zenway sama
dia orang just buat the operations but they already have like sponsors will do all that so let's say we can put our branding there you know besides SCOGA
our venture punya logo whatever it is lah eh we're we're going to call it however going to design it there ya we'll definitely have that uh ya but SCOGA will definitely take a cut is one thing
ya and and that's a thing even I've been talking you know I've been talking to my wife ah technically she's the genesis of the initial idea of all these kind of having our own event dia tak suka the idea of kita um how to say ah handing over the rains to another person
dia nak kita hundred percent seratus peratus ni event kita bukan orang lain punya this is ours have our name over there for and then of this uh
you know orang lain tak boleh kacau ah senang kata orang lain tak boleh kacau
loudmouth partners loudmouth partner kita sure but it's not kita joined loudmouth and we we work under lock mouth
then they'll be like mana nama kau aku nampak nama SCOGA jer nama kau mana
I said oh now we work under SCOGA mana bukti
kita tak tahu SCOGA kita tak boleh you know we cannot we have to take you at your word I don't know about that but if kalau kita boleh tunjuk on a poster that has our logo on it
dia orang tak boleh cakap apa-apa ah they there's proof that says we are the ones that take all this we're not we're not the what ah err we are not not just mere partners or whatever kita tak buat apa-apa but
kita yang run the show
so that's why it's important to have our entity separate we can work together with SCOGA with ah whoever but they have to be partners it's not kita join dia orang we work under their name
satu orang kena start dulu ah senang kata
tu tu yang juga eh that
and then why I also tak nak like you I know you you said quite a number of times we're not you know I can put you can put your own money inside semua
tapi there there would seem a little bit of a chip ah then when like let's take your scenario you said you know we go to sponsors and then sponsor kata okay so siapa yang sponsor your previous event uh and then you say football academy and all that junior football academy
I tengok eh ini kau punya company apa
ah ha ha ha tu yang problem juga
but I think I would okay nak kata our community eh okay now to think about it objectively the positives that can come if you were the sponsor is that you know like throughout the entire days cast you know like we will have you know like um
I macam mana nak kata uh ada orang kata a lot of times at people sponsor benda kan they don't actually get anything much out of it
junior apa junior what
I think ya I think in the end tu nak buat sponsor tag ah in the end
you know macam mana eh I don't even know how to sponsor that looks like I've never seen one before though so I don't know what to base it on
we can actually do that actually if we were to look at because right now dekat facebook eh all the videos kan it will show how many views ada ada ada rather it will show how many views actually
ah what we we won't see total views we won't see how many concurrent views lah apa lah itu semua tak ada um ya even okay right now zenway is live right now sekarang ada berapa orang ni sekarang ada lapan belas orang lagi tengok some mobile legends punya benda
ya but I don't see any total views belum lagi belum lagi total views but let's see if I can load a previous show
previous show berapa eh let me see another video
ah tapi the problem my my midnight punya shows ah
one play sports videos the problem with semua malam-malam betul ah paling awal pun pukul sebelas tu yang problemnya
ada ada orang but it's not that much ah okay ya I'm looking here
mm asia champions league semalam nine hundred views err asia pro league which was on midnight five hundred views
one hour juga ni semua one our cast
but that was the the very first punya lah I mean like it was the first
err but they split it into different parts ah macam part one first two hours ten ten K views
quite quite a bit this four lah but then again eh E sports ada berapa berapa followers ni E sports how many followers
aiman will help out also and in fact if at all possible I would like to ask iman pun can we stream it on your stream
or even better if we can get we can rope aiman in as a commentator juga lah
you know I I can we make but then fees and all that lah like how sia macam mana aku nak you know send prize money it's not that's the only reason why I'm not opening it to outside singaporeans I don't how to send prize money to you
jadi kalau kalau if there's a way eh for us to go meet aiman I'm very sure he will love to work with us and I think kalau kita bilang dia look kita ini kita semua eh kita will ini kita punya event we're not getting paid
maybe we need to pay more stuff you know to add on to the prize money ah so maybe kalau dia dengar tu eh the hope is that he might be able to if he's free on that day firstly because now dia ada banyak banyak event kan
jadi kalau kalau a'ah sia dia banyak events ah so I don't know what he was bitching to us about lah jadi honestly I was like dude ini it like it ah I look I know you're disappointed E piala malaysia of fucking meeting ah err bullshit I just said ah sorry
but you are getting lots and lots of quantity ah you're winning quantity wise those two guys eh other than E piala malaysia apa lain dengan other dia orang takde benda satu benda pun takde benda
ah lepas
tak tak takde benda sia I can't I ah
okay I know that err see siapa ni matthew eh has uh has uh some malaysian cold wrestling thing or whatever there's a totally separate community it's a totally separate thing dari bola tau so you know ah oh kalau nak kata streaming bola jer
dia orang takde benda sia decipher lagi takde benda at least matthew involved in that wrestling thing whatever decipher langsung aku tak dengar apa-apa tau
so ya so he said oh I lost out to them honestly ah it's just connections ah you lost tau on connections ah that you just didn't have anybody that's inside whoever's doing this E piala malaysia thing that's the only thing but you're winning in everything else you lost one event so what that's it is just one event
because I know he's been doing singapore events juga
it's just to tell future potential customers look our our chapalang event tak ada sponsor takde apa takde benda
us sepuluh ribu views tau
you know err ya I also can tell it you know ah definitely when I when I let know of my community err this this affinity whatsapp group semua that's guaranteed a you know a number of views as well
ya let's say they're nah ya this is the one major stumbling block kita ada ah aku aku pun tak tak takde ideas ah apa nak buat like to find my own third party sponsor semua takde idea langsung ah
and he's not like any of my friends like have like companies or err what ah macam macam kau dan aku yang yang my friend hafiz the one that's you know that always leaves comments regarding commentary and stuff like that kan
I broached either to him by eh nak sponsor kita tak you know this sort of event then kalau kau betul-betul managed to get them in eh aku bagi kau you know some some credit or whatever lah some kickback lah so dia kata
won't see anything unless there's a global outrage dia orang tak langsung tak support local which is a lot of ya a lot of companies do that also ya timing also another issue right now a lot of companies are trying to tighten up their purses not spend more
officially eh looking at their website eh dia kata ah they are a youth non profit organisation
kalau nak under official words ah
um ya they have err few initiatives lah all this err E sports academy campus game fest campus legend so ya err and they let see apa lagi dia orang ada eh about us
uh ya so apa ni executive committee
nicholas aaron khoo macam familiar jer nama tu
dah start lah then you just continue talking
apa like gold shop
oh okay that means if this COVID nineteen dah
is the laksa place still there there was a
mini laksa stall dulu-dulu ah when I worked at Equip
ya lah mak
oh the one yang mask tu is shah

I think they usually sorry lah to say but usually kalau put in extra hours they would usually pick the younger ones
but you know it's like it's so obvious kan kalau like the whole team come early tak apa juga
like there are other people who she feels better than her lah gitu
but I also think the the colleague yang nak leave tu like just try sebelum leave just try one shot like you think any possibility to increase my pay since I'm doing more you know that kind of thing then if really you cannot then just quit quit lor
maybe because you feel like aisle way corridor pun tak not safe
can check out art ground yang dulu whether they are open or not
kita tak boleh like impromptu tak boleh

and he went to korea without like any money or anything so macam
and he tak even go for like classes to belajar you know he just like
if we go korea but I don't think we will be able to handle dia orang punya
if you ikut macam the business like module
ya the food punya
itu jer
macam you buy one and the second glasses you get fifty percent off
ambil and try
tak bagi like anybody just masuk tahu so you have to like
queue to masuk
sakit everything they keep saying they keep separating
satu is one species another one is another species
if there's fifteen migrant worker yang kena
they are exposed to tak akan migrant workers jer kan
everyday macam add one two people like in the community cases kan
macam some kind of investigative like journalist gitu
and then we all will mati together
I don't know macam as we grow older I guess
what the world is then we get macam
aku lagi penat daripada kau you know I did more things than you yesterday and I'm like
ya pasal lah penat
cause I don't know if I can do this anymore film penat sia
there's this macam
cause if you think of it that way and it depends on which mazhab you're looking at also
pasal if you're talking about
like kita punya mazhab memang we're not supposed to try gambling or anything
there's other mazhab that's like
like this idea of mazhab is it going to be valid in like fifty years if we're all still here
that's like my question because the mazhab thing came about because of
macam concerns lah
then is the mazhab thing going to change or what
a set in stone thing cause the mazhab thing was never like set in stone
people there might adopt our mazhab punya practices
she will be adopting other mazhab practices and when she comes back here
just about sembah this one tuhan
and believing in our prophets our rukun iman and rukun islam
touching a dog is haram so ya that's like my
macam over
to be fair kasihan ah dia dia macam
sec one lepas tu kena COVID terus tak ada friends you know she don't have proper friends in school
this is like there is a goal punya cerita after that
and she had this other boyfriend and the boyfriend she was together for like five years tahu
the whole family was like oh dia dia minum arak dia pergi
apa dia makan drugs semua that kind of thing you know and then when we met him I was like he was crying
ah you tak tak ada choice lain ke apa like
you know I macam
that lady was cantik lah and she was with us for three years
like kau tak ada perempuan lain ke apa that you want to go for this maid who doesn't want you back
I'm like kau dah tua stop it lah
tak tahu asian pun boleh suka asian asian girls
that kind of guys will be like oh nanti kita dah kahwin boleh masakkan I lah
masakkan I like some sambal goreng or something like that then I'm like huh
you think I kahwin ni mesti nak masak sambal goreng
kau kelakar ke apa you know
the I'll be like oh ah lah I degree tapi film jer film jer you know that kind of thing
kau thanks man
and then you can tell like the first like five selfies is like me like really want to perasan
kau sial
pukul satu pagi saat dia text dah nak pukul dua
hello mas apa khabar
it's okay macam melayu cakap kalau jodoh tak ke mana mm so what are your plans for this weekend
oh yes ahmad is there uh dia sekarang dah kahwin dia ada uh think four or five kids
no lah it's okay ah rezeki masing-masing ah so are you not going out with your family today
like kesian kan
bagus lah tu boleh jaga anak-anak
bagus seh masak untuk husband all
ya but ni adalah satu uh precaution for us to take ya so kita perlu berhati-hati lah
so penyakit ni boleh jangkit siapa-siapa pun tak kira muda atau tua tapi bila dah sakit nanti susah pula tak boleh keluar kerja tak boleh jumpa kawan-kawan duduk rumah jer
ya lah stress lah at work macam-macam
since it's the holidays kan banyak orang-orang datang uh visit museum
so kalau you nak datang dengan family nak kena datang on weekdays
uh weekend tak boleh lah pasal terlalu ramai
uh until nak queue under the hot sun pengsan pula
um tak ada lah semua kena queue macam biasa
ya so ya lah kind of sad pasal tengah holiday sekarang but we have nowhere to go
oh ya ya I've read about it but belum ada time lah to redeem tour voucher
oh I don't think ada
for kids ada tu vouchers I think it's only for adults ya then I think you can
online ah so it's not that bad lah hundred dollars pun jadi lah kan
biasa lah singaporean bila yang dia orang tak complain
mm understand ya I think uh COVID nineteen ni menjejas banyak singaporean
then ya lah kita tak boleh keluar rumah tak boleh keluar negeri susah ah nak pergi holiday pun tak boleh kesian tapi itu lah
it's like they say prevention is better than cure ya so pasal I think malaysia pun sekarang masih ada banyak case ah so it's still unstable lah
I think uh ya ya I saw that I think my friend a colleague of mine also ada bilang juga
ah no lah I think it's just protection the mask think surgical mask pun can do its job lah
ya lah sekarang pun yang baru-baru case dekat tampines mall tu wah
because I was there then I think a few days I think one day later think they announced that there's a case of COVID nineteen at tampines mall terperanjat seh
uh so far tak ada pula case yang lain-lain
I mean yang in the community lah
ah because you will never know seh who yang ada penyakit ni then kita pun senang jangkit especially dengan macam
warga emas dengan kita punya parents nak kena jaga-jaga
ya I think baru semalam news uh that people are queuing over at mana eh
in place ah tapi kan from the look of the photos tak ada jer think these people sometimes are just trying I don't know
ya lah that's where the christmas light up is lagi so this year has been a challenging year lah ah
ada bagus juga lah that you
tak ni lah but ya I think it affects everyone like even most singaporeans who used to frequent to ke malaysia ke I think it's affecting business everywhere uh kedai-kedai tutup ada orang kena buang kerja kesian kan
I think mm mana-mana affected
mm ya lah but I think the singapore government is like allowing people to come in for work for business ah cuma are required to have the mandatory swab test then uh like
tak payah lah so I I dengar daripada kawan-kawan yang kena swab test yang
uh kalau
kalau dibuat dengan betul tak lah rasa sakitnya kalau orang baru or trainee yang buat wah rasa lah pasal dia orang cucuk dalam sekali
ya I think I even my friend yang
ya actually quite kesian ah in this situation macam banyak orang ada family but
kena berhenti kerja business tutup
twenty twenty has been uh ya lah like I said a challenge lah untuk kita semua mudah-mudahan dipermudahkan lah
measure steps ah I think which is quite good lah for all lah even though maybe some of us feel that we are restricted tak boleh keluar ke apa but still it's for our own good lah
oh I do actually err I think he pre-ordered the mask even before COVID ya I think I think he's the type like ah so he and his wife dah beli
ya but I don't know how berapa bagus yang reusable punya mask
tak lah because uh
bulan december err think my mother's birthday is coming so maybe nak ajak makan lah but
wah only can keluar um five lima orang sahaja
think kalau the atmosphere is different lah when you dining outside err dengan makan kat rumah kan
take care of ourselves lah think the celebration is is actually pasal kita nak kena
mm mana kita berhenti tadi
um ah awak
seorang baker awak suka masak apa
untuk family
pandai juga awak baking eh abeh kalau masak masak apa
oh untuk lah eh suami awak family awak makan yang sedap-sedap pasal sekarang kat luar pun banyak kedai makan yang tutup pasal COVID ni
mm mungkin pasal orang dah stock up ke uh iya lah singaporean kan macam saya cakap kiasu dia orang suka benar simpan
oh beli barang banyak-banyak rakan kerja saya pun ada nasi uh three or four packets for a family of
ya lah kesian yang orang-orang yang ya lah tak ada pendapatan mm tapi saya rasa ada juga restriction on every household that can buy certain like rice like maybe two packets of rice per household
mm ya lah saya pun kesian juga orang yang tak ada rumah tak ada tempat tinggal mana agaknya dulu kalau masjid buka boleh juga orang tidur dekat masjid sekarang saya rasa lagi susah lah mana dia orang pergi
mm betul tu uh there's a lot of platform yang go digital so I think uh everyone every household actually needs like a smartphone like a laptop ah these are now necessities
ya I think uh a lot of companies are like working from home and stay at home when they can lah so it's best they do so lah during this period but then your brother is from the airline industry airline industry I think is badly affected seh ya I think my friends either yang kena retrenched at an early age eh
ya kesian kan
I think dia tak akan take the swabber paying job lah pasal I think he has more kids at home kesian takut he'll be affected lah even though he'll be uh think
he has his reasons lah for not doing that kind even though it's uh gaji tinggi but still dia tak kalau boleh tak mahu dedahkan uh
ya where should we go to makan what is your favourite food
yes the curry is uh sedap
ah ada yang baik tu boleh juga pakai app sekarang kan semua
wah see sekarang semua dah high tech
order makan pun boleh
ya at this point memang ah it's not
not right to be walking on their own tapi ia untuk kebaikan dia orang pasal kalau dia orang dah terexpose dengan COVID ni I think it will take masa yang panjang untuk dia orang to recover to get well ah kesian I'm looking at my mother who's asthmatic kan macam I try not to let her out of the house as much but sometimes you know they want to go out have fresh air ya kesian kan
mm betul tu abeh lagi cause my parents are staying on their own kesian kan we don't get to meet them as much abeh ada some old folks tak tahu pakai smartphone so lagi tak jumpa anak-anak cucu-cucu so kesian dia orang so masa-masa gini lah kita patut berwaspada even though it's sad but we have to follow lah
ya lah yang generasi yang
lama mereka tak terexpose dengan internet macam kita sekarang so with this technology I think dia orang will
ah ambil masa untuk
so kesian so
macam makin kurang and there's less interaction human interaction
ya lah tapi segolongan mungkin tak ramai orang tua yang mahu belajar pasal pada mereka mereka dah lanjut usia and dah tak banyak masa lagi dalam dunia cuma kita doakan yang terbaik kita pun kalau boleh
mm actually in the market now there's quite a number of phones lah yang mereka boleh gunakan cuma iya lah nak kena ajar mereka tu mungkin mengambil masa lah
that's why it's uh important lah to untuk mereka um update dengan keep with the trend apa yang berlaku bukan jadi trendy lah cuma keep up with the times
mungkin juga lah tapi sekarang mungkin dalam masa yang terdekat akan masuk ketiga so mudah-mudahan kita semua dapat
um balik semula kehidupan yang normal
some dan hari raya
mm uh macam
kirakan contact is now minimal lah mm
sedih lah tapi macam mana
mungkin kelonggaran ini akan dinaikkan lah setiap fasa mungkin melebih lebih orang boleh keluar boleh jumpa boleh bergaul tapi ambil masa ya
iya lah pasal singaporean usually kalau holiday akan go overseas uh mm holiday uh tapi sekarang tengah
tak boleh kemana-mana cuma di singapore
oh bagus tu idea staycation
boleh juga awak dan family destress
mm okay lah ya lah macam saya cakap ini adalah
the new normal yang kita akan lalui tak tahu berapa lama lagi
harap bersabar sahaja lah kita doa-doa yang terbaik semoga keadaan akan bertambah baik untuk kita semua
oh itu safe distance ambassador
ah dia orang akan memerhatikan
okay lah ada yang volunteer ada yang dibayar gaji ni part of the
government agency yang united mm
mm tu lah saya pun perasan juga
tak lah mungkin mereka
berjalan-jalan untuk mencari orang yang melanggari peraturan lah tapi saya tak rasa dia orang boleh mengangkap dia orang boleh menasihat
uh dengar kata dan tak lawan peraturan-peraturan mm
oh tu mungkin dia orang volunteer daripada lain lain agency mungkin yang tak ada uniform tu mungkin
dalam bekerja lah untuk united
mm agaknya pakcik tu
uh tu dia orang tu dah nak hantar boleh lah
time semua orang tak ada kerja lain
ya so he was on my list like eh local uh local account lah like eh this one look like singapore like that ya so then I went to see then actually the at first the dia punya videos was all quite macam angsty ah like
oh you see this vulgar tat tut tat semua basically like macam all the people like being annoying lah time dia tengah nak deliver
and then it was very weird because I also saw one video of dia pergi tampines mall and he was like guys look it's all dead dead and I was and pasal tu time kan so we cannot go out kan and I was like oh my god I've never seen tampines mall look like that
ya serious macam like like some horror story is here
ya then only okay I'm not sure if it's recent but like I only recently noticed that he started doing live kind of just scrolling one day like malam-malam buta like nine plus I was like eh this guy doing live live what sia
because at that point in time I just thought macam he records and then edits and then posts right so I was thinking he left and then my my impression of live is like you sit in front of the camera and talk right so then I was just like oh wow wow he cause it
yes abang grabfood
and I think the funniest part was that um based on his cause his accent is quite vague and like you know he's the kind yang like cause of like his friends dulu kat secondary school semua kan and primary school so he like knows how like malay slang also he's like apa ni bro
he actually he has the beng vibes but the most kekek thing is like the way he talks is very macam narrator that's what people described it as you got the narrator voice very mesmerizing
kelakar lah like
ya it's quite bahan actually
exactly so I think actually by right dia punya target audience is
all following you it's so scary you know oh my god like there was this kid dia macam
I was like I say asal this budak like freaking thirsty you know
macam dia kata come live with me apa apa apa then aku was like
eww then aku press dia punya profile then I was like oh my god this is like some eleven year old girl dancing I'll just like get off tiktok
ya oh it was so scary so and then um so he me to say thanks for sending like coins and likes and stuff then the way he talk kan is macam corporate gila
tu lah pasal dekat dia tanya um in which area do you reside I was like reside eh
first off aku dah block dia I was like saying uh don't worry I'm not under age I'm like I'm twenty four and he was like okay that's great
ya because uh and then semalam pun like there was this girl that was like remember me I'm the sixteen year old girl then I'm just like ah eh awkward
technically ah I mean it makes sense because it's like their generation yang pakai kan but it's still very disturbing lah but I'm just glad that he doesn't like ya he like tak layan and then he doesn't assume anything oh ya then he was like how do I address you ah aku was like how do I address you macam then
the next for me macam the automatic response is miss farizan takkan lah kan apa seh macam merepek sia
zan ah actually aku was like alamak aku terlupa nak tukar my um name pasal it's still zan A yang ikut my um and aku was like
alamak too late to change to air lah takpe takpe lah zan lah zan jadi lah
yes oh my gosh he was like I'm very tired right now but if I'm not wrong you asked me to call you zan right and I was just like yes senpai noticed me ah terima kasih terima kasih
a'ah I was like opocot aku jadi marauder I there's actually like no real function to it ah cuma macam bragging rights jer
a'ah so I macam ah my dreams
ya I was I was like planning kalau macam ini hari kan kalau aku jumpa dia I will be like grab ge</mandarin
probably dia macam siapa then aku was like confirm tu kena instant block
oh ni dia eh yikes
tampines that's why so dekat
ya actually dekat and I kind of roughly know macam tempat dia lepak
no lah not his but his route yes because like like kat kat tak banyak tempat yang that you can
like order food from it's always like those fast food places it's always the macs yang dekat the interchange always
every night there will be at least one from there burger king dekat the
so I don't know like actually his account macam supposed to be like educational ke apa at an entertainment but it's so true I think like now I can identify like know the back models and shit in case like aku yikes
ya and then there's the mat minah tiktok
is that is that the meaning of pull like can I pull you I don't know because I keep seeing it on my feed then aku macam what's this eh like
I macam pull apa eh macam pull follow ke apa ke macam but it's like those thirst trap punya videos
ah a'ah kan I tak faham
okay but macam maksud dia tu apa
I I was just thinking of the mat minah call
just macam
macam how did you discover that app do you remember
ya ya because macam at the start that was what it looked like kan it was macam in between musically and vine
macam there's the reputation kan
technically those people must be underage juga
no it doesn't come too often I think that one is just macam by proximity like you know the few local
you're talking about macam algorithm dia
that's the thing which I'm god I'm very surprised because like once I post terus like it's very fast but then it like just dies off I macam okay all right
like then the subsequent macam views and stuff will be like people who are what searching for it
ya ya so this one macam the benda-benda bodoh I don't tag it I just macam
ya so that's the thing right I was like wow I didn't know that tiktok ada live firstly so then like his live was the first one that I watched
ya so it's um it's really interesting it's like you know how um live eh no not live eh live and live ada like the likes kan but it's just macam free kan you press
jadi boleh spam ke apa entah so apa ni like tiktok ada like some kind of coins system okay like for few coins you can sell like emojis
I don't think it's that much lah because like I said macam dia punya follower base is more like budak-budak kecil so macam he will he will say say like oh thanks for the like double like I send the rainbow puke
he was like oh thanks for the rainbow puke and I pun macam he's like rainbow puke is not is not cheap I mean it's not even one cup of bubble tea sweet talk sekarang pun like dah lagi mahal bro
so like everyone is always saying stuff like oh come to my area come to my area he was like you send me a carousel lah kan and aku was like what is this thing he's talking about
you see that's why you should donate to me dia cakap kelakar gila dia macam his humour ya
and then like I think I finished my virtual punya class and macam they just started opening that time face to babad like
like middle of last year or something so I always like holy shit like how I know I I I uh I recognize the dance moves kan then I was like hey insyirah like is this afrobeat standard like ya macam how you know and all that then aku aku was telling her lah that I listen to the songs and all this
then she was saying oh it's that this studio da da da da so uh it took me like damn long like aku just took the information and just like buat bodoh ah until happened
and then phase two then aku was like okay if I were to do a dance class that is not a lindy I'm gonna do this
a super fast one and aku was like aku nak mati eh
after a long break it's just like rombak rombak and I was like ha
like and then like each five ada like segment ah then you cannot mix
then that one uh because you maintain two meters tak payah pakai mask
ya my lindy punya yang solo pun begitu uh our capacity is about twelve
so sama lah two meters and all that tak payah pakai mask tapi tu recently um because of uh partner work and then like we are constantly sanitizing then tu kena pakai mask ah pasal like contact
but itu pun they try to minimize like they try to do more solo dance sikit jer partner ada ya
dah lama I tak joget penat gila sia I was like ugh
stamina dah turun muscle semua dah macam dah layu
that's the one yang I I started with ya so a lot of my songs are yemi alade songs ya
it's like wah I love him macam the dia punya beat dia punya percussion dia is like is like
it's not as tacky as like macam ada like dia punya ah rentak ah dia like kebak kebak means like cool
and macam I feel like dia orang punya bahasa is actually quite nice also
ya then recently like um the class introduced me to all new like new songs lah as in new and macam different artists ah artists that I don't listen to it's usually like this guy artist
I don't know if it's cause like he only listens to guy artists ke apa besides beyonce
ya oh my gosh okay so that's the other thing like I feel so macam at home like finally an instructor who's not doing zumba
like that's the only thing kita boleh buat like hello excuse me hello police
ya so and macam the group feels very nice and chill and he's the kind yang like having fun is more important
macam you you just try and do like it's okay if you don't catch it exactly but macam he wants you to like feel the music and like enjoy
ya but he very cool lah macam even the not the okay sorry he's the receptionist but he's the studio owner he's also malay
no no no actually K K jap there's two people the receptionist is called ash so he's she's owner and then zul is one of the teachers
then hakim also teaches like um dance fall but I don't like dance fall dance fall macam a bit macam sexy ah I macam oof
ya then okay it's quite kekek like last two days kan I went for the same studio I tried uh homerun choreo
that one like aku nak mati sia
the person kan like mellow she's a good dancer but dia punya ajar dia macam like from the get go is like super detailed
macam my brain cannot
macam badan angle tangan angle
ah kepala angle I macam ugh
ya so I said I don't like I don't get the I don't get the flow for K pop I macam
yes and loncat-loncat
then macam I felt so demoralized ah like it's so susah and like
so for me the thing is that like kalau stuff that is not a lindy end I don't want to use my brain so I have to use my brain after and then I get very fed up
I think cause I'm not like a fan kan I just do it cause macam it looked interesting
and then the ones next to her friends semua they were like eh today I become chicken ah I was like that's not wrong macam a lot of them their position I'm just like kenapa ayam kenapa ayam
ya macam cool but okay like if that's what you vibe with
sorry ah pekak
mmhmm apa-apa pun pekak
eh lupa ah K jap
no lah okay so ceritanya is apa tau this phone the near RAM only three gig
dia punya internal kalau bukan sixteen thirty two eh
and then eh I try to log in from outram sampai past series belum log in you
disconnect lag crash semua the whole cycle
whoa macam no ya so then I could I could I really cannot you like besides gaming macam
apa eh like it's just super laggy ah macam everything keep crashing and I was getting very frustrated
and macam segala benda pun tak boleh buat pasal err internal memory dia dah habis kan
so like literally I was running on entah something macam hundred of free space ke apa entah
exactly so that's why macam dia punya performance pun dah macam tahi ah
huh but anyway dah dua dah dua tahun ah
so I'm not sure what I should be using this for I I might use it for macam work taruh like um prepaid ke apa kat dalam tu
because actually phone ni tak rosak ya it's just and after I bought it over I I can uninstall all the things I'm not using ya so
mm it's okay then now I found a new use for it lah because I was thinking eh macam mana kalau I want to game but I also want to watch his live
I akan dengar I just dengar suara dia jer
ya dah suara dia sedap
suara dia macam macam dia punya voice quality is very good
like macam okay K K uh I once irritated my friend then by sending him like a maplestory M punya guide
macam kau dengar aku macam nak sepak ah hmm
but this guy ah macam kau just dengar just like ya macam cool like night setting you know
ya but ini hari I think ini hari dia main muzik so
sekarang you you'll hear him like sing and stuff
macam daripada mana eh tiba-tiba kan
but like why dia need to pakai okay sorry no no no apa dia punya power actually
dia macam apa gravity ke
I was like huh macam-macamnya power dia
kalau kau kalau kau watch three a day
kalau twenty three sikit jer
eh kalau you tengok six a day tau six a day by right empat hari dah habis twenty four
kau rewatch eh
rasa macam escapism which I'm like oh macam I don't like to be too close to reality
it was the most merepek ah okay okay no that's not okay I take that back after seeing things that bandai has released recently that's not the most merepek
but it's the most macam fantasy lah like super idealistic you know macam the guy must must always get the girl and then ada rival ada love triangle
that's rude ya macam
habis orang mati one episode the next episode everybody's over it like bitch
ya macam oh and then um they are like super gifted and talented pilots like out of nowhere macam
because at that time kan that uh macam the way you pilot is still macam pakai macam like you driving gitu ah you akan pakai um got the apa macam clutch semua and all that pedals and stuff
it's not like so I thought that was quite smart macam the later on the animes kan they they used macam uh like it it goes into your brain
and stuff so much lah you can you can see like it's instinctual you know you don't need to control it uh I was gonna say extra silly physically like it just reads your nerves ke apa entah like okay sure like that's fine
like macam if you're naturally or maybe you fight a lot like in person so maybe that translates when you fight for granted like okay fine that's kind of understandable
but like macam gitu lah they are kids man like there's no way that you can just be gifted like oh macam drop drop from the sky gitu like merepek
ya because it's mm it's a bit dia punya plot
there's then gundam got a few timelines so there's one timeline that he's like like the gundam sampai like
and then they continue macam star wars gitu ah so it's like wah the timelines is like freaking messed up
ya but that one was okay but it was macam eh a bit too that one a bit too fantasy ah
ya betul
ya it's always senang kalau nak cakap
because you're not in that situation apa
ya I see that a lot on twitter also macam they will like err retweet those those um am I am I am I an asshole punya post
and then dia orang just like throw the whole man away lah apa you know macam like ya like macam
I guess you can write that way but macam think about how that person is like going through right
ya macam kau they only they only have one season so it's like twelve or something aku rasa
then macam huh okay itu jer like ya that's what I was thinking oh actually kalau I wanted to catch up session quite easy
and like the singapore people don't even the singapore punya what or something they don't even bother to like remove it like
ya but that's the thing lah macam
but macam it's very like we we call it like what anime typical lah canon typical violence
so macam entah leh
but our censorship selalu macam tu
kau rembat jer
kekek jer sia
ya like ho kita cool
kan kita dah besar
but usually they will put actually okay no actually that one was for like and stuff right they will put like macam sixteen then I said they will put the the like triggers kat bawah macam
it sound so weird but macam
like in the science textbook they always show you macam
alah benda tu macam benda biasa jer bagi dia
you know it brings me back to that convo that we had about macam like
and is it okay but I think it's really like macam commendable lah that you are like now taking on the responsibility even though it's like shit but macam
wait kejap dia interested ke dia macam intrigued
it's just like macam thinking about it
it's so weird that when we say younger is now like sixteen seventeen but time tu kita rasa kita macam dah besar
masa tu like my god is sixteen
so it's like so meluat
when I jumpa that my malaysian friend I was like duh
as in I didn't say it macam explicitly but I was like dia baru keluar dari sandiwara ke apa
macam the perangai and cara dia cakap and cara dia like um carry himself is so reminiscent of that I just I was just nice I was like you sound like um I was just trying to be nice
give the full burn satu
mm a'ah yang mana
oh pasal apa eh
oh wow mesti of course and his father is like
oh wow mesti of course
totally wrong ke it's okay it's okay
kat masjid dia orang ah
dia orang ada Q&A session ke apa
wow habis no one was able macam curious cat version
macam he's trying lah
did they show the questions yang she wrote
it's not like macam lame questions kan like those questioning the fundamentals eh
ya lah pasal hari-hari orang just setakat tanya um
ah is smoking haram
macam dah stop it sia like
okay for her everywhere and jalan
okay so orang ni tanya soalan and then they
so dia dia received the question so ustaz tu received the question lepas tu dia dia just simpan dia tak address on the spot
it's true lah I guess it's macam it's getting better these days like definitely but macam
ya ya like kat rumah ya
sekejap eh dia actress dia pakai tudung
macam macam like if it does not add to the plot right kenapa nak bagi sangat orang tu
so kacau macam kau nak tidur lepas tu dengan pin pin dia semua
oh macam uh yang instant ah
I see like unless dia orang nak cakap orang-orang malaysia semua like sleep with tudung like that lah
step like I was going to say step alim but is that rude
bodoh kan
orh macam
macam tak ada ke tak ada ke model lain eh kata shampoo eh
atau macam at least just maybe like say macam the fragrance is nice or something and then like
mm tengok yang last sekali
mm nasi ayam
sustenance wise memang boleh lah tapi kalau fikir sangat pasal
the taste I think can be very boring cepat muak as well
hmm I don't really like mee kuning
boleh lah
peliknya ah do
and I tak faham dia cakap pasal apa
steamboat macam dekat
ada wire
itu lah kalau lama-lama nanti sesak hidung mm
mm ya good first time lah tak pernah try mala
tetapi kan
pun boleh kata macam muak juga lah
tak boleh lama-lama sangat lah makan
tetapi ini sedap lah
rasa sikit-sikit kan
ya so kalau private they
dah bagi timing lah nak datang hari apa and at what time
oh macam acid reflux ah
I kena malam itu just berapa like a few nights ago ugh
lepas itu nak kena bangun pagi untuk kelas like pukul lapan or
mm nak
tetapi kan takkan setakat nak beli satu sahaja tempat
so macam child best situation ah
err I think season four baru nak masuk
dia buat makeup dia macam itu ke
but I feel macam
I mean memang ah it's a show but it's too overplayed
macam terlalu drama lah
I know dan is jadi gossip girl tetapi macam tak make sense eh story kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku
story kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku
mm sebab boleh nampak mm
dia macam he in one scene dia pun terjekut he was
texting quote unquote texting gossip girl so dia texting diri dia sendiri lah kan
tetapi kan kalau
kalau theory is
other people were also manning the website of gossip girl boleh masuk akal
ya or macam
ya and the fact that dia dapat marry serena pun macam err
serena and then he talk trash about her dekat gossip girl
mm raccoon lah bapa dia pun sama jer
tetapi wait dia punya part
part rambut itu
no lah dia punya hairstyle dia kadang-kadang macam tak match
eh dia dalam cerita star trek
oh bukan eh
uh siapa baru give birth tak eh
oh bukan bukan dah lama dah
apa seh
I mean I'm saving up all the cerita for after exams
mm tengah belajar
so nak kena make sure lah
kena make sure betul-betul nak yes
macam interesting jer
psychology is something you can take on tapi kalau tak nak pun tak apa
time duit and betul-betul nak atau setakat fikir saja
uh well selalunya orang cakap two out of three is okay already but I think for diploma and degrees
but tak ada duit pun tak boleh ambil
ada duit ada time tapi kalau tak ada dedication macam buang masa
I think if you want to go for it just make sure you ada lah these three
perangai melayu yes
ya lah fikir pasal duit lah sekarang memang okay
but kalau nak ambil one more
and kalau
personal betul
why kenapa
tetapi kan ambil lesen
nak fikir pasal sekolah so kalau ambil lesen nanti nak kena divide
exciting itu memang lah but sekarang I pun tak ada kereta
ya tetapi kalau tak ada macam
kalau tak ada use for kereta
macam waste of time itu sahaja
ya lah I sudah biasa sangat naik public transport
yes yang pasal the drawing mm yes
it's like an accomplishment dalam hidup
not seven wonders ke
I think so wah kaabah sendiri pun tak tahu
okay so america then europe tak ada tempat lain dah ke
apa try studying
tapi itu lah
change starts with you so kalau nak start saving
mm you know boleh is very forgiving
tapi nak kena tengok juga jangan potong too close
apa semua nak kena ada allowance
so I think it got a bit derailed sebab exam kan banyak focus dekat exam so dah tak fikir sangat lah like I think
ya so I think maybe selepas
yes selepas exam maybe dapat masuk balik lah then
ya tapi bila buat sendiri is tak as senang as dia tunjuk
ya memang banyak video tetapi I underestimate how
mm I thought is macam yang
speaking of I think my kawan-kawan are planning like a dinner or something
uh tak dah bangun selepas itu tertidur tapi bangun balik dah macam terlajak
mm tengok cerita incredible tales
tapi cikgu itu forgiving lah dia cakap okay tak apa lah it's late but I will mark as present
mmhmm apa dia
err ya I agree as well belum buat banyak pun macam uh
nanti dah tak ada moral lah
ya tapi bunuh satu pun dah macam mana
otter satu biasa pun dah besar macam mana
okay lah at least dah tahu lah apa nak cakap
for me kerja dekat bakery pun masih ya allah pun masih boleh can
mm weekend shift kan of course lah weekend orang semua datang enjoy bawa family
bawa family exactly
mm tetapi
itu lah takde tempat lain ke
dah lah dah dapat hundred dollar voucher pun masih nak datang dekat bakery lagi
ah tak tahu lah nak pergi nanti macam waste pula
entah lah
eh no lah I rasa macam tak biasa saja tak biasa orang pegang
yes dia selalu
ya dia buat dekat I pakai janggut
ya lah it means memang tak biasa
tetapi ya lah I can try to biasakan
I mean apart spa you got any nowhere else to go ke
kalau ada bathtub boleh buat air panas apa
soak sahaja lah dengan sabun semua
ya hari itu I baru nampak gambar fireworks I pergi dengan kawan I for twenty twenty
then sekarang macam ini condition ya allah
I pun nak tahu this this
uh december new year macam mana
itu lah
macam concept of time macam lost you tahu
mesti benda kemaruk seh
well I think for me this year is a lot of change I mean I thought tak masuk sekolah seh
and then sekali dapat masuk poly

itu lah
then dia balik
tetapi the next morning dia dah tak ada dah
tetapi mama tak ada kan so dapat I
eh still I I basuhkan dia apa
daripada kindergarten K two

ya dia dia dia mati tua lah
tua tapi tak tak pandai jaga lah
no kita orang ini
tetapi kan sebab kan pasal kucing kucing macam ini it makes me realize that I will not take a pet
bila dah hidup sendiri kan tak akan ambil
mm tetapi kalau fikir balik kan if you're not there at home is
what's the point and ya menyeksa lagi ada
walaupun kucing boleh hidup sendiri daripada anjing kan
mm tetapi if you're not home
tetapi nak kena ingat juga it's a living thing
ada corner lah
ya lah there's no saturation of market lah dah tak ada orang nak beli and daripada
and kalau tak jadi pun lagi satu hal
ya then better tak payah lah this is already perfect this is nice already
mm sejuk
tetapi selalu ada orang masak curry
ya pernah ada orang itu masak curry satu malam semalam bau lepas itu I tidur bilik you
ya satu malam dia buat mm macam apa lah dia nak buat ini
lepas itu I tidur bilik you apa sebab itu lah
you tidur kat luar sebab panas
atau you nak buat kerja I pun tak tahu
mm tingkap buatkan bilik nampak besar apa
okay so is actually um in which year eh you nak get married eh
err you also have to think this if you are staying like in one year's time then you need to find a a bilik or a room yang like you actually both are more comfortable to stay with lah correct or no
ya lah correct lah tapi sekarang I think you you both have to think what's the budget lah so budget actually berapa is it a combined wedding ke</malay
mm okay okay lah then I think kita we have to take a look part by part lah kan like for example K now a wedding will come first before the house right so and um so basically is between like err in six months time can you get the new flat is that correc
if the business already there then okay there's a plus point so I think at least the renovation will be on the kitchen so if you ask me the kitchen you need kan macam lik
which one you want to cut down ah on the on on itself like it's like flat versus wedding so if let's say uh if you ask me then of course I will choose the flat lah because apparently like macam flat kita nak tinggal sepanjang hayat chey sepanjang hayat ah
like I say uh the the most important thing is the the the nikah itself only so other the miscellaneous take photos okay that's another to me i
um family support have to come in so that's why that day you all kena macam plan budget like how much like per per side can contribute with their family already inside the picture lah that one have to be very like um
um very like uh transparent but in the event if let's say both side macam let's say for example your parents either deal with their own ideology or plan of their wedding the
you ada your own plan of your uh I mean his side ada dia punya own plan of ideology then I think the only thing you have to fikir or think about i
parents like okay maybe I can only afford to pay for how many guest then the rest you can absorb tak so that is another another way lah kan macam kita nak um try to put everything in hand lah
so wedding time at least your side macam okay then for your side uh you and your family then like for use okay I can only pay for hundred guests then if your father say okay another hundred guests I can top up your father say like that then is if sometime
you may say that having a separate cost more but you will depend on the individual side of budget eh sometimes kita kena fikir that in terms o
this is something sensitive in even in our culture in kita punya err orang melayu kita macam sensitive ah about duit ni so I think you all have t
considered in the air because like right now both families belum sit down and really get to know each other you know even like for me and my brothe
about duit pun kita adik-beradik masih sensitive tak boleh macam eh just bang aku mau pinjam duit kau lah satu ribu macam suka suka jer nak minta kan abang you know I have to be like more tactful to u
kak are you okay if I pay down then I will I will lay down what I can afford then in at least is like more clear cut tapi kalau macam</malay
like in this case lagi the other party yang your parents belum kenal kan and then the breedlove assumption the so I thin
then how much your both parents can fork out together so if let's say you dah sample among all again okay lah kita work combine then okay celebrate buat combine tapi if let's say oh
ah you know lah I still want my one thousand guest let's say hairin punya side the
your mother say okay tak apa lah based on your budget kita invite saudara mara dekat jer one hundred okay then you do separately because let's say his mother say okay then I will pay for tha
because there are two factors you need to think first um kita tak nak mengecewakan hati siapa siapa pihak because you all just become a new family member secon
like want to have a fresh new beginning with a very good fit startup lah tak nak macam semua gaduh gaduh then after this the next time dia pergi rumah</malay
like macam err
tak tahu lah macam waterfall at that I find it or even tsunami so offence already like I will just like get err
and then july got a flat ah my kita punya timeline two years tu nak engage</malay
you know then tak tahu macam mana tahu bought flat then because ah because atuk said better
cepat cepat nikah dapat rumah sendiri then after that we are like ha
then like that everything all my plan with your uncle semua macam dah haywire all I received only fla
kita punya like dream wedding kita punya dream vacation semua macam dah flash toilet jer tu begitu ah so it's lik
I I'm quite fortunate like I have support or family so like macam ah my father know that he will pay off my wedding expenses whereas for I will just focu
um makanan tapi kan shamefully I have to admit even I dah work that time kan I tak boleh afford tau because I just start my work the
and I'm about to save so like macam even like you know the bridal like you all have all these ah then I think I can only afford the photos begitu that's all with with my husband then I think my husband that time even hantaran nak exchange ah
um I think quite I I would say I like macam drag it lah but I think about it because in the end like we don't really can afford even for exchange of hantaran I think in the en
then because the the story was that that we will promise that some sustain law said okay lah why not kita combine kita beli dorang dorang hadiah untuk exchange hantaran</malay
uh the equipment that include all the err the kompang and everything I think some weddings some packages inclusive some are not so kita kena tengok macam mana lah kan so is lik
orang melayu kita ni actually err come with a lot of err gotong royong even though kita tak sekampung lah not inside you won't believe right so the thing i
relative will still to will be okay to like macam pinjamkan kereta you know so when if you no
err how to say farah see you just like okay lah whatever people uh rent you okay lah something like that so if let's say like your your your parents like know like macam</malay
uh certain relative got this car whatever they say eh I chope your car dulu for the coming wedding can or not just ask lah
you know or maybe like dekat dekat wedding tu you ask becaus
uh dulu I in this case usually lah people will still be alright to loan for wedding car then you just lik
uh we're not that chinese must be like Mercedes-Benz or Jaguar lah pe seh joke ah I'm not racist tau but I'm talking about culturally we no need to be like so branded indicative kind of of stereotyping that kind of thing lah so it was just like kita like just focu
ataupun early january next year you and your partner must how much you all can fork out agak agak because by that time you dah start your full time job okay then he already has its sort of monthly berapa one month berapa dapat sav
so basically you can agak agak already estimated amount that you can reach between end of twenty next year is what twenty twenty one ah
this one take time lah but again uh I think hairin uh or or hairin lah siapa lah uh maybe is t
because this part I think you really cannot butt in yet because uh you ini kan actually masih macam saudara baru dalam keluarga tu</malay
so memang lah nak kena macam jaga-jaga jugaa lah kan yang mereka seems like okay okay tapi tak okay kot</malay
ya memang lah um to plan the wedding is not very easy so I think is one phase at a time but despite all these challenges must really look at it like macam secara positive ya so at least that macam you know what you can um do best within this err
uh constrain the constraints of it then from there you workout on it lah so let's talk about happy things lah macam stress jer cerita cerita macam begini kita buat cerita cerita happy pulak dalam pasal pasal wedding ni</malay
so kirakan okay actually that time you got share with me kan tentang mak andam like quality of mak andam</malay
ya okay macam itu kira not too bad lah kan because anyway the number of guest is being cut down ya actually if you ask me if you want to make use of the pandemic als
very good if you you all like macam prepare and then both both parents are okay ah it's just anyway you also have time also nak save money you kno
the money surplus keep first can go for honeymoon because I'm pretty sure by that time maybe can go new zealand because um certain country dah already open kan so macam you can just like chill relax lah macam</malay
tak payah lah macam nak fikir fikir sangat kan then after that at the same time there's another part of money can still keep saving for one year for the house ah that's another advantage lah
ah ini pun if let's say both side okay lah I know it like I think both of you you both of you I think you will like kita macam like okay jer like nikah is that correc
oh I think that part can't be helped right we all memang lah keluarga melayu ni mesti nak macam happy happ
know you are like can can just like uh kita sama sama you know ramai ramai meraikan chey macam meraikan ilmu pulak tak ada lah saja mengeratkan silaturahim so I think can lah I think we jus
ah but now I think for now don't take it as uh macam sedih nak kahwin kan you just more like if all the all the err apa ni restriction constraint you just take it like what can be done during that point that point of time lah
ya so I think for you for now don't stress too much but it's just that you all just save as much but you both kena bincang</malay
sebaiknya like what can you like save like within a month you know and then what to work on the next next month macam kena ada like your own goals lah but if let's say if both of you like very nekad</malay
or very determine like what you want nak buat kan like macam tak kisahlah apa orang nak cakap kan biarlah you know so basically you just can just ignore and then you all like determine what you all want to hav
um to prioritise lah then kalau let's say family kata oh no no no no I just want to have the big wedding you know you have to then you just sit lah ah okay option one I let go the fla
ah that's another option lah that means to get a resale flat maybe dalam three five years that macam ah you know our relativ
some of them ada so you can have like that or another one that you also can have like uh just a another second option you tell them okay I can have only this budget both of u
you know ah sendiri sendiri yang macam nak spend lah so if let's say if this side kata okay boleh ah can we can come out each another to ten thousand ten thousan
ah then okay then so semua boleh centralised atau pun nak separate itu another one lah ah because I thin
about tunang he can never be meet everywhere lah kan like macam semua happ
then that that is the fact in life I think it's very very difficult you cannot make everyone happy so I think we can only do what is the best of the situation kalau let's say macam boleh</malay
then okay loh kalau tak boleh oh too bad lah because um either or I think there's only some loss factor for example if they use option on
for you to uh come back and then apply again for another flat there is another factor lah okay then if there's an option two that both parties cakap okay lah why not we bought uh you know yang</malay
norms lah sederhana jer like very minimal number of um err what you call number of peopl
then after that then that's it lah finish okay dah tak ada lagi lah that is the the the point of it ya so that is one of i
then that means but you prefer you talk to your parents both of you like macam tahu okay kita ada this amount kita ada ni kita boleh prepare macam ini ah then ah
orang ah orang mampu macam ini jer lah kan like it's like you know we can't be bo chap in everything sebab we just have to be like telling what we hav
on the table then after that err you apa ni</malay
err for you both all you want is just nikah maybe take beautiful pictures go err nice honeymoon then dah habis then after that focus kat rumah</malay
oh okay okay mas kahwin is err more important than hantaran hantaran is culture mas kahwin is agama</malay
ah so mas kahwin is part of the err macam dalam dalam term dia dalam arab is called maha</malay
so maha is the compulsory amount that you supposed to provide so the amount yang kita dapat tu minimum is actually is if I am not mistaken yang kasi the minimum amount then other than that above is up to yo
ah you know so that is the the initial so in ya I think in don't know which negeri ya dia orang lagi emphasise mas kahwin then a gift gift tu hantaran lah bagi dia orang ah that is culture melayu kita ni terbalik ah
macam ah gift tu lebih high daripada mas kahwin but right it should be another way but I think err mas kahwin ke</malay
err hantaran err for me lah I think it all depends on the affordability yes correct to have that amount is for you your parents cakap tak nak ambil kan tapi the thing i
even for you the amount to them is a a stipulated savings that you can have one shot for your house but I think along the way err sometimes rilek jer lah
err you can have the best of both worlds kan jadi kita kena tengok mana yang lagi important lah kan ah
that's why I said despite the whole thing now seems already dah pening kepala lah kan like very um you know so you you just got to doa for awhile rilek you know don't need to thin
err so in detail yet but at least to think okay now macam okay ah you know what is among all these things yang macam</malay
like you can because you think things that you can control macam budget photographer your brother ah these are the things that no need to involve family wha
like bridal studio photo or this not belong to family right even the exchange of hantaran also not belong to family so anyone want to give extra is a plus poin
but other than that ah if let's say for example ah we exchange err three saja lah item let's say for exampl
okay ah for example a'ah cuma satu I this one I don't know eh dulu I should have known luckily I never ah exchanged quran do you know that what is i
like uh okay so jada is common tapi seh jada kita tahu you will be used for um after marriage in when we play together but when talking about quran and something like actually you must actually reflect the whole when you hantar al quran</malay
you mean the hantaran</malay
oh duit that one that one is the mas eh ini not mas kan that one is err alah hantaran lah ya lah but some give cheque ah nowaday
or can be just a cheque amount ya that is one thing of it lah ya if you ask me can be cheque kosong ha ha ha ha
cheque kosong what but inside is PayNow leh is direct transfe
ah so is all depends lah but again if follow tradition ya lah they want to see for real to sure masih cash you know you know bank not
like a normal cheque just to display in fact if you ask me a paper also okay but mesti there's a transaction and PayNow
mm it happens ah actually happens during my time also is like oh because they only said lah when you actually in engagement phase that there's a lot of challenges gaming up coming up so ah ya lah macam</malay
like you say like you know some can we stand some cannot tapi to know each other's partner is very very important so i
so I think like this uh family support is one factor very very important to me lah that's why err I mean culturally kita melayu is very united satu hati lah kan macam like kita you know lah we are lik
we always like um always don't forget like what to do I mean what to to help out even like with friends you know like we hear when peoples susah even like just now you say comments comments just now righ
not none of our business also lah but the thing is like people also like sibuk and go and go and comment y
oh it depends some some partners maybe like they do in front of you like they buy you lavishly and all that tapi out there maybe dia pakai card card card tapi tak shar
per per per person or individual like that like macam tak tunjuk lah kan macam</malay
err like no communication with their families feel like tak tunjuk or what lah ya so that can happen tau macam</malay
tak tak tak ada then why you ask me after seven years dating pun tak tahu dia ni buat apa ke kaya ke kan maybe all the while the guy only show up front oh aku ada hadiahkan best best you kno
ah dia bukan pun tak tunjuk kind of thing some some can leave that up staging on staging eh macam berlakon staging up everyday which like to me it's excruciating ah but some people ya carry on maybe like for example dia partner no ah
the other party tu tak ada duit maybe tak you know not affordable or whatever but she she will ask and then she always try to give her so he thought or maybe lah should be okay lah nanti kahwin pun okay lah macam sekarang</malay
um he has so many money aku minta pun okay jer ah you know sounds like but I the end when the person say oh uh he's in debt for the wedding ini ya actually that is not the only on
I think dari zaman our grandfather they are always this occasion people last time if you watch P ramlee sho
ah lie lah borrow the chetty lah you know that that particular chetty will always just borrow lend the money to them what um high interest and then end up hutang because because our tradition that our culture that sometim
then like for example ya you you want to prioritise on this you have to have budget and so is it again like assist supporting the family lah kalau family understand family tahu what you can what you cannot and the
it's okay we'll like for example like a friend of mine both of them wah very have good job then they get flat dengan with their pa
so there's uh about three months is like or four months ya tak start he take a break but he got ready a job to start later on so he used tha
that's why he told me lah kan so like macam very kelakar then I was like abby you all gaji seventy eight thousand dah
then like let me oh mampus ah like that like that then he said no lah it's just tha
the you earn actually the more expenses we have you know like uh like macam peribahasa melayu apa the apa kerak nasi makin tebal makin</malay
ah tak tahu lah don't know lah there's this particular you know so basically this is the this is the part that he always remind me that lah which I always think oh
to know you usually parents ah whether to let go kids to kahwin I think me as a parent I will only see whether are you ready financially emotionall
if financially you okay then no need to be so damn rich lah right no need to be like so kaya or whatever you just need to have like um
ah more than enough like can start lah macam you can pay your bills you know you can you can uh you can have a proper food you know don't end up like until like when you have kid
err want to want to buy a normal sayur or kangkung</malay
um when you work you have to think is I always remind that's why like when when when my anak when all of you come to me my anak anak saudara ask me about weddin
my concept is what is your vision apakah your punya vision to achieve in building live together if your vision is to hav
okay a stable marriage a stable home then to me is wedding to have a lavish or not is secondary because bottom line you want to stable yourself you nak make sure tha
you start something that with no hutang you know because basically you you start something with hutang you got headach
I am not saying when you are together you know hutang lah kan you will have you got kids already hutang will be there bu
is not as if you are not able to pay that's the only thing lah ah because memang ah kalau memang kita ada segalanya memang ah kalau kita anak anak sultan johor ke daughters sultan daughters of sultan johor can lah
but the thing don't let it kill you lah that's why I said err in this case kan suka ke tidak instrinsic back breakdown tu kena ada</malay
ah introduce you must have really must have because if not lah if you ask me lah wah very jialat lah like every everything also must risau bu
what can be cut down what can don't need to cut down I mean kita tak boleh convince like that macam like for example ah you kno
fathers oh mesti nak ada lima ratus okay bu
because you already give a picture you know what can be done what cannot be done then your parents ah okay lah boleh lah boleh lah sembarang ah he will come to a point like that I know my brothe
like he will come to a point apa-apa suka hati okay lah korang dah plan kan okay okay tak apa</malay
ah engkau continue okay I will I will support you it will come to that bottom lin
err kalau ada superpower maybe I want to be someone like maybe bat man or iron man
macam gitu ah
macam okay apa
you nak jadi apa
okay kalau kalau
takpe K ah basically kan kalau
superpower yang best is superpower untuk terbang lah

three people or five people family punya account ah that's how they make the money
and also from the advertisement lah because for every movie mesti ada the sponsors siapa masuk

no ah oh auntie I always just say cik cik rozi ah cakap something ah
then dah you all dah makan belum
semua tengah tidur kan
tak dia punya ingredients kan beli kat pasar atau uh
you mean the ikan is the the one that is boneless eh
um mesti
ya the sauce right then pour on top kan just just tuang
I think just but the sweet and sour you can make ah macam mix and match
apa apa ya like
tomato semua ah tomato um pineapple
ah capsicum sedap I like I like the capsicum
the yang makan masa ah kan
for for us actually if let's say our our family kan macam nak ada maid kan
kalau siapa dah kahwin kan atau like we have our own house kan maybe separate ah let's say I
no I mean like one maid ah because like the maid tak payah just stay at one house do all the work what because sometimes mak ada nenek ada kan so maybe can
the maid is okay then we we must bayar for the transport
and maybe give them time off ah kan kalau
tak complain atau tak
feel macam pressure kan we we like they call it give and take ah
don't over over work the maid lah kalau maid is okay then okay what you know
this one maybe we can plan ten ah next time because bapak kan dah tua<malay kan nanti mak
like at least like the maid boleh masakkan actually the best kan the maid masak
right because if the maid masak right then we just need to buy the stuff ah then sekarang
tak payah leceh pergi kedai apa kita boleh just order online kan
but any online pasar or not macam pasar food eh buy meat or chicken ada eh
but I mean like the betul punya pasar online maybe maybe
no because fairprice jual beef tak eh because beef is very hard to find right
um macam mana the person tahu
oh no oh but means the device kan then the the user mesti jalan to
our our house all small what america everything is so big kan I mean america everything you see dia punya rumah besar-besar or I think european some also the house big kan
but the device is uh quite mahal kan I think thousands right
so seven days tak payah pergi kerja ah just somewhere else ah
itu hari cakap open the ikea but oh but now open lah
so nobody can meet their friends to eat what so they just have to eat cepat-cepat makan then then just balik class ah
but that that time weird you know ah dekat mana eh
apa nama kedai dia yang mister you you know orchid house dekat serangoon gardens tu
orchid house the the indian food macam mamak ah
mamak food
al-azhar gitu those kind macam woodgrove gitu ah
phase the first week of phase two kan atau I think I jumpa my friend during the phase two second week ah kan
phase two is about nineteen june kan so about late about twenty seven or twenty eight june I go out my my friend makan dekat tu ah orchid house
pelik ke so that means there's you cannot communicate like weird ah kan
mesti customer complain or next time they choose somewhere else kan because
because of the apa seating arrangement
and some people they apa like they in a group kan say eight people ah four four kan
they are together but then they sit separately but then they like can change table and then bersembang lah dengan kawan-kawan kan
um I heard the store owner kan atau business owner dia orang call the
but sometimes we think oh it's no big deal but then if everyone can do it then later next thing happen next thing that you tengok news
eh but do do you think it's possible kan kalau dia orang make a system kan means by far away then they auto checkout
ah if the person off then tak boleh ah kan
ya the the app apa what's the name of the that time they make the app singapore made the app
it's good kan macam but if that one you off or you off data cannot right
actually that one bagus tau pasal you like eh hey google then the you can play spotify
K because my my friend he dia pakai google home eh google phone tau so I use apple ah but the that time I stay punggol also share with him kan
so he use the the what google assistance eh yang cakap the voice ah
dia cakap even your google is like off or something right they still listen to you is it correct
ah macam macam mana nak tahu ah
no I mean macam mana nak nak tahu that whether they are listening to you or not
no I think if let's say oh but I think google kan macam mana eh if you like ask question kan like no need the internet you like ask for the weather right and there's no wifi then they will say um oh sorry we cannot
something basic ah like uh what time is it maybe dia tahu ah kalau tanya something like um
my friend eh my friend singaporean kan but then he dia study full time dekat pergi luar ah
then dia punya apartment kan
then dia pun ada alexa I think now alexa better ah because
I think that one bukan maybe that one is it thailand something ah I cannot remember
ah the ah the dekat mana eh ah this place ah that time I went interview tanjong pagar go it's called what guoco tower ah
so when you tap kan dia dia tahu which which place to go to ah like which lift to go to then but when you going down because when you tap means you know that is going down what

pasal kadang-kadang orang suka tengok ngaji tengok ngaji jer you know what I mean umi kalau nak umi tak nak kalau selain melainkan kalau umi dato aliff ke dato vida nak tunjuk kehidupan takde orang kisah pasal umi kehidupan
so kalau umi nak buat channel umi buat satu satu topic tu satu niche umi boleh buat macam kesihatan ada orang buat macam err buat duit anything lah okay lah okay contoh eh contoh contoh let's just pakai contoh orang lain
okay um kita tengok channel channel orang lain eh kita tengok berapa banyak dia buat okay contoh um channel siapa siapa yang ustaz ustaz apa ustaz kazim

okay lapan ratus enam puluh satu ribu kan subscriber
okay okay lah ni ni anggaran jer dia buat dalam three point two K per month okay tapi the thing is benda ni kadang-kadang dia anggarkan jer it might not be true macam sometimes dia boleh buat lagi banyak lah you don't know okay lah let's tengok macam channel um celebrity eh
siapa ah siapa yang buat channel err okay lah aliff aliff syukri okay dia suka buat youtube kan
okay jer bonda rozita
um ni bumi ratu channel okay ni jer
okay dia buat dalam empat ribu lima ribu lah okay per month

okay dia dia punya video banyak okay tengok eh dia punya langganan langganan berapa okay satu point empat satu juta okay dia punya upload dah seribu lebih ah video dia dia dia naik kan okay um and then dia punya view dah banyak dia tiga ratus lebih pasal dato aliff ni dulu dia bila dia start tak banyak orang tengok lama-lama kan banyak orang tengok jadi
okay dia daripada malaysia okay um dia punya okay estimated dia punya anggaran dia sepuluh ribu lebih okay
ya sebulan yes so kalau convert sana tiga puluh ribu ya ringgit lah tiga puluh ribu ringgit so this is
I mean ni bukan dia punya ni salah satu stream untuk salah satu apa tu dia punya periuk nasi ni bukan dia punya main source dia ada business dia this is just untuk marketing jer buat this is channel is untuk marketing dia okay
umi buat ngaji lah I'm doing this I'm doing this for your ngaji no lah remember I take video for your masak that one I haven't upload yet
that one is okay kalau kalau masak boleh taruh lah cuma um tak kalau nak ramai orang tengok I don't know lah maybe like very slow lah kalau nak cepat tak boleh cepat lah kena macam perlahan-perlahan upload upload lama-lama they will increase dia punya views
pasal sekarang kan umi nak buat kan untuk umi ngaji that's why suruh umi buat ngaji punya you ajar tajwid like macam satu video tu dua tiga minute you berbual pasal qalqalah
qalqalah then you give like contoh ayat
okay then you okay ni episodenya okay ni dah okay ni lepas qalqalah you cakap maybe hukum lain lah I don't know hukum lain untuk tajwid okay episode ni dah berakhir kita jumpa lagi pada episode seterusnya gitu something like that um
ya but kalau umi buat ni umi kena consistent lah umi tak boleh buat macam
ngaji okay kalau umi nak orang orang tengok umi kan orang kena macam cari umi punya channel pasal umi nak belajar sesuatu dulu kalau umi dah misal kata umi dah banyak buat video nanti kalau umi nak ngaji later later boleh ah tapi sekarang I think better you buat macam video yang
um boleh
boleh juga tapi ngaji um
kalau umi belajar tajwid is tajwid is better lah
lagi bagus umi boleh ajar tajwid dulu ngaji nanti lah nanti because ngaji you know banyak orang lain pun boleh ngaji kan I mean it's on they got all the sheikh sheikh all to ngaji whatever then ngaji can can but not now lah now we focus on your tajwid first or your iqra
ya boleh mm ajar tajwid then maybe umi boleh also ada lagi satu series untuk orang yang baru baru nak mengaji ajar iqra macam ajar dia apa huruf huruf hijayyiyah all that
lepas tu ya lah that that's what you can do and then you can do a lot of things

with some you know the you remember the the the link that afiq sent to the silat group
about some gym bag yang you can sign up
tapi nak cakap apa eh
melayu aku err melayu aku melayu aku sekarang pun aku sekarang tiba-tiba tak boleh berbual
oh okay okay saya faham saya faham
it's just quite funny then wah my cat just manja like you know no tomorrow you know
okay but you know esok I tomorrow I have a meeting again
no not silat only I responded sia
cause I cause I'm reading the mail now apa
ya lah memang bukan main-main tapi afiq ada cakap pasal err kan syaz dapat kerja baru then syaz ah dia cakap macam aku boleh rasa afiq dah tak ikhlas sekarang
no tapi so aku tanya dia like kenapa dia err
okay so like I ask afiq like why he keep why does he keep holding this on macam for so long then he said that uh because syaz just got a new job then he doesn't want to err like ruin her spirit ah or something like that I don't know then I'm like that's damn that's damn bastard lah serious like damn bastard
I don't know I think they wanted to go out makan or something and then like they wanted to like because amar didn't want to be like so exclusive then he wanted to invite the two of us
because we have to keep we have to fill up the one hour usually when we talk we don't fill it up what it's like kita ada we have blanks you know
so amacam eh amacam so how
faham tapi itu so basikal bapa dia apa
ah takkan faz minta izin bapa dia habis bapa dia tak boleh ikut
ugh kenapa
apa yang okay
tapi kita nak berbual pasal apa eh
apa just just ini cakap nak berbual
apa yang kau merepek eh
eh kau punya melayu rabak juga eh
kau just just berhenti bercakap okay apa kamu
tapi aku dah lama tak berbual melayu macam gini ah so susah juga ah
kau nak kau nak kau asyik berbual bahasa baku jer that's why kekok
tercakap bahasa inggeris ah
memusnahkan recording ini recording dalam bahasa melayu apa
so kita sekarang tengah merakam pe
kenapa dah lama tahu bahasa melayu kan jadi macam gini
yang tertiba okay okay aku faham aku faham
err aku just tak faham ah kau nak cakap apa eh
dulu kita err apa eh
apa yang kau tengah berbual eh
ya allah susah
kenapa kau kena pakai saya awak ini ah
oh gitu
okay jadi kita nak berbual pasal apa sekarang
boleh juga lah kita buat gitu
kau asyik cakap benda just
kenapa eh
aku rasa tak ah
tapi sekarang ini kita speak in full sentences ke
ah okay ah macam gitu ah
dude your oh my god your malay sounds so kekok
kenapa eh
but macam mana you terkeluar Zoom
okay tak apa I I ajar you macam mana nak pakai Zoom dulu cause I use Zoom everyday so I'm quite
okay lepas tu kena sign in usually cause I'm under like my my account is under the under school so I punya sign in is just under sign in with tapi kalau you punya personal I would think you have to um sign in pakai
your own email lah tak okay but let's just pretend macam you ada your own email okay
okay so like selalunya when people ask you to join a meeting you will have they will macam send you a link kan then like from from the link you you just
select you can see like my background kat sini kan you it's apa um it's virtual screen so maknanya my background takleh nampak lah
kalau kalau messy kalau
so you can change like your virtual background ah at the bottom at the start of the video and then you can just pick choose virtual background so during class I selalu pakai virtual background cause belakang messy kan so I don't want to like show my background so kalau it's not the option is none it would be no virtual background
tak ni dah log in dah
so uh you can also add in your own photo so for me I macam I create I even created my own background just to
bagi lawa lah so I I use this
tapi kadang-kadang kalau pakai ni kan it's
so background is done and then um apa lagi nak tahu
okay so like for usually your share screen will be under here I think that it's the same for tablet dengan iPad I think ah ya
I'm not sure about um apa not android apa nama dia Windows punya laptop but
so kalau I pakai desktop kan
it will show like so even if I'm on Zoom and then I click open my WhatsApp punya web
ya but if I pakai if I choose the Google chrome punya kan
so even kalau macam I tengah pakai Google chrome lepas tu I open WhatsApp web
dia tak akan nampak I punya WhatsApp web
ya cause cause I choose only my my Google chrome punya err window
so like this would be hard macam uh once you share screen this will be your screen and then you can just toggle back to your Zoom I'm not sure about for for Mac I can just um
okay then another important is your mute button cause you know selalu macam
you selalu cakap then ya so muting sometimes even or when you whisper orang boleh dengar
and then it goes the same for the video lah kalau your video takde they will just show your name like this
ya then you just unmute usually for me dalam class I'll just unmute I I'll just mute myself
ni lah
tak yang tunjuk you tadi
she download on iPad and then after that whenever you download an app on your iPad dia akan tanya kalau you nak err apa
macam for privacy measures they will ask you to like allow allow camera allow microphone
ya yes so like for hers tadi um
so even kalau even kalau dia
so kalau you pakai video kan
uh apa nama dia
actually you can see yourself lah kat tepi
right so as long as you see your name it means that you are apa the video is done I mean the video is off
apa done
and then other basic things is like macam
raise up your hands or err apa
okay I don't really have it oh dengan yes no
okay so they will just ask oh ah who knows this question who knows the answer to this question raise your hands then you just angkat tangan
tapi angkat tangan takde kat sini lah
apa rename yourself so if let's say but you can only rename yourself you cannot rename for others unless you're the
so record is just you boleh tengok balik lah the recording
record on cloud means on your Zoom account which I which I prefer cause if you if you record macam macam that time I conduct my master classes right
macam movie gitu
find a way to upload that huge file to make sure everybody can see it then susah lah
ya then lepas tu I just um I tried out uh record on cloud
then orang akan just
ya orang akan be direct redirected back to the to the Zoom
chat ah okay cause ni tak ada participants sekarang kan so
mm then you know you can change err to everyone ataupun to a specific person
mm tak boleh
tapi kan ada orang cakap yang like what like the host who
ya so I don't know I don't know if it's true but just to be safe I don't like saying anything like nasty things about my lecturer kat dalam kelas lah ya
so make sure you bracket privately then when you send a message kan you have to make sure yang apa you you click back to everyone
tapi kan sometimes get confusing cause the messages your private messages and your messages uh your and messages apa to everyone
ya so you just have to macam baca betul-betul lah like which one is everyone which one is to you only
usually when I want to like ask my friends something then I'll just like click to apa to to my friend ah
breakout rooms is just uh macam tadi you experience that smaller rooms right so basically let's say you have a participant of macam
lepas tu orang tu nak breakout into smaller groups to do group work
macam create let's say two rooms
and then like as a host I will just break up the rooms but as a participant bila I tengah tengah tengok
cause for adults I don't think you guys pakai much like for meetings only right and during meetings also you don't really talk much like you let your boss
ya but like students we always have to tutorials then like when tutorials you have to talk to get participation marks apa
ya so if you like uh if you're a host then you can schedule meeting so like let's say macam I conduct my fundraising master classes kan the other time I will I will schedule a meeting and I'll just pick the time the date and then
mm I think it's better than apa what's the other option the outlook is it live live
but it's so susah just now
no but like but like what was your apa what were the activities that you do and everything
escape room ada virtual
I tak
I tak pernah pergi lah but like how so so what must you do in that escape room
cakap lah
apa it's the starting of the
I mean technically it's in the poem also what so like even if you baca like
but this is done by the escape room punya punya company lah
oh so like the facilitators like bought this escape room and then cause like they had you had a separate facilitator macam team bonding facilitator right
cause cause got my for my global studies punya apa
no it's like macam okay basically if it's physical kan in school then they will give you like nearing to exams lah macam your apa midterms or your final year then they will give you like err a literal goody bag
then inside macam ada foolscap ada snacks ada like ya then like all these are like
err apa get
promote ah sponsorship ah sponsorship ya so you ask for like you ask this company for sponsorship lah but usually like if it's a bigger scale like what like your whole faculty punya goody bag then it's usually easier but like for us cause we are just a small apa faculty group kan
in the end they were like okay we give you the sponsorship but um is to try out our apa
um room punya fee
they will ask you to get a certain number of people it's like a trial run dulu lah
tak tak tak kita play for free cause they just they just want to see if you can get the people or not
cause the main point of sponsorship is you nak orang uh you want to get as many attention as you want as much attention as much attention as you want what kan ya
you have to source out for the for the people lah but in the end we couldn't cause it was only for android punya phone
and then cause at first they tried to apa
E-vouchers for apa three different three different categories macam welfare eh welfare pula beauty uh food and macam activities lah like yoga and everything
but like the sponsorship rate was the the turnover the turnover was like just so low then in the end macam I think they just decided
ya so it's a bit sad cause we tried to macam we tried to
apa delays and everything a lot of the sponsorships tak reply cause COVID sekarang then even their organisations not doing well apa the companies not doing well
like even like activity punya entertainment places pun tak not
ya then now I just finished my fundraising punya series oh
ya then then even if four hundred dollars at first macam kita
we just like no confidence ah macam it's so susah
uh members in that EXCO group like he gave like constructive criticism lah he was like you you pass the target but then like a lot of people also macam donate in bulks what like you and mama
seventy per cent seventy per cent pula seven dollars out of like our total is still quite a lot what
just you sorang jer
apa embroidery the worst was makeup cause I think macam is so common like everybody can just watch YouTube tutorials
so so that one a bit but in the end err a lot of my EXCO just join in last minute so to the person teaching the makeup class macam it's not that bad lah ya
cause it was still macam ramai then she was like oh my god didn't expect this much this many people and then I'm like oh ha ha ha nasib baik cause there's only like
three people yang sign up ya and it was very no three three or four people yang sign up
from the faculty punya group
oh at first he I don't really know him but I just tahu pasal he lives in my for
not not like as close friends whatever it's more of acquaintance macam I saw his uh
I saw his poster inside the inside the lift the other time pasal
ah this excel course lah pastu I macam and I wanted to join that time tapi I had something on that day so I couldn't make it
I was dengan tengah planning for this fundraising I was thinking like hmm like what other interesting courses would people be interested in
then I thought macam I think
err apa
not hands-on macam very practical skills that people would need macam in their workplaces in their school right
he was just like ya sure sure lepas tu I I went to find out err he thought the class was like he was conducting the class for the somali refugees
then I was like no it's not then I was like oh my god so kesian then he was like no no it's fine I was like okay
dah I told him already but
two and half cause the maximum kita anuh is
actually I don't even know what's abang doing
like what what what did he macam in the end
oh bukan as in what is he selling like what kan dia
oh macam
macam GrabFood lah
so it's it's just plain rice chicken dengan just different sauce
mana seh
I don't know I just go novena untuk err skin centre
ya but the soft launch abang nak buat apa
but it's a a like you know like stall in in a food court ke in a
in a shopping mall ke
okay lah like atas atas punya food court cause I heard like there's apa
err pasal it's this semester is all online kan I didn't even step in school like for one moment
err go back to school to study apa
no at first cannot sekarang dah boleh
but jauh
you boleh tampines hub is the most not conducive environment ever
it's so bising you ever went there before
it's so bising like the there's a playground I mean if you go there like two that you know that kind of like hours like no more shops then okay lah understand but like
but it's not conducive and then people study like outside yang kat atas semua it's so hard
but like two hours macam so sikit if I want to study there
ya and then nak nak nak belajar kat luar pun
some establishments macam Coffee Bean they have no no laptop policy like cause they know a lot of people like going out to
tapi it's a take home so it's like twenty four hours
but that's the worst like I did that for my previous exam err my job punya module
cause they know we have twenty four hours and you have like the liberty to cam use all these
your laptop semua kan
even if you have friends macam
paiseh kan nak tanya
so it's usually like like apa a combination of err topics
very very little exam and then it's all replaced by assignments which I thought macam lebih lebih bagus ah
uh non exam modules and two exams pastu I macam happy lah yay three three modules no exam
ah ambil kau semua submission at the same time cause usually
if if you have two assignments or three assignments usually lah err the macam apa submission the deadline is
tak tahu kenapa lah but it's just like that ah
but the assignment like most of my assignments here um especially towards the end there will be this like one major like so all like consolidating nya assignment
ya so like let's say I have this refugee policy punya mod
my major apa
so you you bayangkan I have to do that and that's not my only module I have to do I have my other modules and top of modules I have readings to do readings which will help me in my modules
semua yes you see
twenty eight october eighteen october you see it's all like about the same sama-sama
macam now
ya the the amount of time you take to finish one essay right like you tak percaya you tanya kak shima the amount of time you take to finish one essay is like super long okay
there's the planning then you have to make sure like what you write is coherent you have to reference and then you have to find more sources that everything is so much easier to like just belajar for that one
uh like you belajar for certain period of time and then you just do exam for one day
I just got my I just go my apa
twenty third november baru end
then cause different assignments is different weightages apa
like like I think it's cause macam they don't want to people to know the bell curve also
mesti I macam huh
no but it's also like sometimes a a blessing I guess cause like you get like B B then like you work so hard on your last one then you don't know right so like when we dapat results you macam
lagi cepat stress
you naik year three year four it gets harder and harder what you have to take harder modules kan
I just want to macam freeze my lah so that it won't macam tak turun tak naik I mean I mean naik is possible it's very hard for you to naik lah honestly
ya tak turun lah basically
dorang nak tunggu vaccine
ya so like they were thinking if they like delay they hope there will be a vaccine that will come out already lah but unfortunately tak ada vaccine
ya then they they said but they will extend cause the application for the next round punya dah actually dah tutup
but then they just buka balik then they said oh it's until oh it's two more days actually the deadline the due date
then you said then they said you can apply but your just your application will just be like as though you're a new student so macam tak kira kalau you ada you were accepted like me like in your exchange you will still have to like
my major punya requirement is that
like in sem one and sem two consecutively cause it's like macam group work
okay so technically year four students you cannot go in your sem two so sem two is out lah I tak boleh pergi lah
mm so sem one but my course my my major ada this requirement that you kena ambil this particular module
like in sem one and sem two consecutively so kalau you miss out in sem one tak boleh ambil in sem two jer tau
two uh apa different modules from two different universities
and then after that time difference also cause it's it's like a macam group work gitu ya
ya which is why like we were we were okay we were okay with um just like err apa nama dia
uh doing online kalau boleh
if you are apa namanya I lost my train of thoughts already ayah keeps calling
no I mean it's it's actually calling your it's actually calling pula it's actually trying to like
take two different err from two different schools macam macam mana you you can attend two different schools like it's at the same time some more
I don't really have hope yang kita akan pergi lah cause it's ya it's quite hard
but they have to wait one whole semester for us to continue working again which is macam tak baik lah like who which which organisation is nice enough to do that
no kalau kalau
kalau one kalau one year then I won't lah like no and and it's not just them it's like
the faculty I mean my major macam just extra want to have this module to be different cause now we are like interdisciplinary module everything
but the the new application yang dorang kasi it's more
apa there's more options ah
kena submit lagi ah
if you submit you get accepted you can still reject apa and you and you won't
you've been looking forward to this but nasib baik I I stay in dorm if not like I really like no uni life at all
what takde
know like kak shima stay in the hall everything
what it what people are mad about is like macam the the college tak
they don't they don't dia tak relay apa-apa
only after two weeks they reported baru ada like
the laki lah
it took two weeks just to macam do something then that speaks a lot what
jap eh ada ayah ni apa apa ayah nak ni
jap jap and then after that like they and then we were like
and then like just cause of that even though like other sexual harassment activities happened in other universities like not much attention is placed on them just cause like like you know macam sensation lah like the media just wants to like keep on uh saying oh again
no but but in but kita punya people keep saying my uni right you know in other universities it's worst but but it just don't hear reports right
a bit penat
tak I mean like sometimes the
if someone is busuk and then like
I mean you think like the person tak mandi like is poor or what macam
abeh kalau orang tu uh
hang out dengan
ada lah sekali pergi dating with my friend
tengah jalan-jalan and then like because like had a huge I mean like big dinner
ya lah and then want to jalan-jalan to just to keep uh keep the food down
abeh tengah jalan-jalan sekali sakit perut and the dia

saya rasa saya punya choice
mm pilihan
hmm dia
dia punya orang suka exercise sama macam saya dan
dia punya acting also quite
funny dalam quite lucu dalam cerita thor
but satu jam macam a bit
long lama
yes lagi dua puluh minit more
nasib baik the other one tu ada manual factory defect
tak sabar ah nak pindah ni
to bring the boxes but tadi
please ask bilang dia boleh boleh suruh pinjam kereta dia or what
kerusi kena pasang kan kalau tak nanti orang jatuh
ya all all the dining table kena semua kena screw
have to wait pasal diorang belum pasang lagi
I think letak dulu also can
supposed to be white what all but now got hitam-hitam I don't know why
hmm it looks kotor
ya it looks macam ada mould
suruh suruh diorang nanti anuh putih balik ah
err shum um shum I mean shum my mother did say lah if spray nanti bila panas it will crack and then it will peel so it will not is not nice lah
we can just paint the pipes black but the hot water tu we just tinggalkan like leave it uh like as it is
the water pipe my brother say semalam tak pasang pasal
the counter top belum kering lagi so they have to wait for it to
stick so before they will pasang a'ah because ni semua diorang baru tampal
quite okay what yang ni
mak ya we can go but
definitely banyak orang mesti we have to bangun pagi lah
we cannot like dilly-dally pukul sebelas pergi we have to go like nine
they have sambal goreng the have begedil
sotong sambal sotong I'm not sure
no it's macam like um no
but macam like wasted lah because we've already
dah buat laminate for that
if it's from the start kita bilang diorang just do it as like a bare
we can boleh buat the wallpaper lah
this okay what ni hmm hmm hmm
isn't that macam kat
it's at ubi no
yang tempat kita makan prawn mee tu lah no
no back back lagi lagi
oh ni yang tu lah kita beli lampu vision kan
don't know tak tahu
tak lawa sangat lah
that one has to be like macam
two minute two minute tadi tu kat bawah
it's very melayu
this is for the belakang or what
tengok lah so lah
I mean we could ask if it's like macam like hundred dollars
why don't kita just no just
and maybe like maybe during hari raya time we wanna change
this quite cute ni
okay dah dah
okay so from my understanding right apa tu
the kadi is you book the kadi from the website right okay so and then you don't actually contact them apa tu
takpe lah it's okay ah
it's okay tak payah banyak-banyak then ya
oh okay jadi kalau kadi tu macam stay further but you select that kadi because you prefer also okay lah oh
boleh ah
tapi I have to wait until the date I want available first right so I cannot do in advance right
oh I see that means kalau if six of june I still have to wait until sixth of june available then I go in and register
oh I I I I takut what or not I takut go in ah then I click click click click right then suddenly right it submitted then my date right not available then if I need to amend kan then is charges takde eh
tapi on that day is your date available already lah on the
oh I see so kirakan before the date available
you go in you select the kadi so err I mean you play with the form tapi you don't submit
oh I I was thinking of doing that tapi macam takut tersubmit then you amend changes
later have to pay the difference ah the the charges ah and then ya so but I was also curious ah I want to see the form right and what is this question required because because my date is a double date so will be very err sought much sought sought after lah so don't want to make the mistake ah then that time you book masa tu nya err it's a sunday
mesti popular kan but then err
takut tak dapat kan
dia punya cause the dad is bukan is a non-muslim jadi kena cari kadi kadi tak banyak cuma ada sepuluh ke I think sepuluh then
oh I think about ten ah ya but dia ada lagi satu err punya susah lah pasal um dia nya kadi kan dia tak boleh apa tu
err kalau buat dekat err location lain kan dia nya kadi cannot be yang full time staff
so full time staff sana ada about tiga orang so out of the ten
I only can pick seven then from that seven I think got two or two not fluent in english ah so my err number of kadi shrink shrink then entah abeh sekarang nowadays I cannot see the kadi reviews on the web eh dulu got or not I saw a lot of the video being recorded previously
he's okay he's fast I prefer pasal dia nya dia nya style is like
berbual sikit then go
ah itu lah ada satu err kadi tu dia quite quite
very eloquent ah tapi bila I tengok dia nya video kan
ya pasal sekarang I know yang satu kadi ni yang I identified this salim jasman I saw
cara dia buat macam betul relax ah err he just
tapi bagus ah because you tak ingat then that means also no stress lah bila baca baca jer ah
ya ya ya it sounds it sounds baku ya
ya lah ya lah tapi berbual macam berbual bahasa melayu pun kelakar juga ya
tapi yang kadi tu is your family punya err acquaintance ah
oh tapi by then you don't know who that colleague is lah
okay mm okay jadi kirakan my plan sekarang is to go to the website fill up all the details then tapi bila dia punya date available submit straight mm
oh tapi dia to submit is there's a submit button right as long you don't submit it won't go through kan okay
mm okay same here okay jadi kalau time slot dia is err macam mana tu satu kadi can have more than one time slot ah
okay and then the charges untuk err this registration ada tak
tapi the marriage prep course tak payah kan
tapi yang yang dia tanya tu is masa jumpa kadi
okay yang dia interview tu is
yourself your err bride the the wakil
the wakil from your your wali ah
okay so so sebelum interview dengan kadi is you jumpa the head of the first
oh so jadi yang dekat tu jumpa dia punya punya
oh and tu masa during that time will be the time dia minta to any prep marriage prep course or he ask you to go ah oh that's after oh
okay berapa eh
tiga ratus lebih kan I think dengar-dengar macam tiga ratus lebih
okay oh dia masa tahun bila baru dia cakap tak compulsory eh
huh ye ke oh okay
harus ah
betul juga wah tapi masa tu tak ada wedding cake
pasal dia single single layer kan
ye lah ye lah
tapi yang cake ni is is actually not a muslim right is west western culture ya okay
sekarang nowadays they offer macam hotel one they offer dummy cake just to for the photo taking
oh yang jaga makeup okay
mm mm nowadays got pak andam
mm pasal nak ikat dia punya bunga eh
tapi sekali jer kan maybe before the dia nikah jer kan
tapi mak andam sampai the whole day mah
sama lah
cuma cuma dia punya masa tu thinking is dia nak pergi sana cepat so dia ada time to makeup lah tapi
for bride lah ya you dah plan pe
oh tu tak boleh jadi
tapi kalau orang dah bayar untuk tu semua mana boleh seh
kirakan sekarang ni macam they are macam err they messed up the err planning
some some some mak andam because they because they want to do their part which is so they the the main thing is they make messed up the planning lah okay
okay dia panic lah okay
kirakan flexible lah okay okay uh huh
mm jadi kirakan kalau macam if we do nikah and wedding different place that's where the problem comes
oh kirakan bukan pasal delay pasal they earn more lah no lah we we already paid them for that whole day so inclusive
tapi oh but you know how their charges are is like per whole oh not oh
mm tapi prata okay
okay jadi mak andam is not requirement unless you have err several outfit change
oh okay okay jadi sama lah I think for my side I think I don't want to have mak andam I want to have like the makeup artiste is okay and also to see whether I have err ya
I I even thought of what you know because dekat err katong sana kan there are many err salon ya then we thought err go there early ya
ya cause very close eh because yang grand mercure ada banyak salon ya how good ah that's why I have to go there okay
ya dia pun I email juga mm
most likely we also will do the same thing lah kita tak akan ambil mak andam jadi ah the day macam one off saja lah
oh okay mak andam is for rental cause they got special rate
tapi of course photography on the same day is the best lah cheapest ah cheapest lah because you do makeup all that
oh okay so we do the nikah and the photography after that
paling senang dekat dalam hotel tu tak boleh gerak-gerak
mm ya dia nya swimming pool I ever went it looks nice lah so I think I need to ask the person on that day
three three err I think for for your case kan tiga jam macam okay ah very manageable
apa yang teething problems
the because of the shortage of space right the clearance of the the food I I saw is a problem aku outside mah but I can see people no space sit ya
pasal panas oh ya lah hari tu memang panas jadi yang dekat err lawn tu mostly budak-budak parents semua tak pergi seh ah
ya I I I also saw a lot of people came to witness the nikah
for for my case okay lah terus settle
cause for for err the place I have right there's a stage jadi kalau kirakan okay I was think I can rent for three hours three hours so I thought the nikah start at eleven thirty
lagi-lagi kalau apa tu like what you said
betul juga tapi wedding memang ah orang macam panic kan jadi ada sikit problem sikit lah cuma apa tu
the itinerary so example eleven thirty my nikah so
nikah plus err tea ceremony ya
ya lah siapa nak ikut to the letter kan yes
okay cause I thought the nikah and the tea ceremony will be done the first thing in the morning
kirakan I want to like macam eleven thirty to one for example is nikah tea ceremony and then
that's also the time kalau nak tukar baju pun boleh tukar lah
okay tapi kalau COVID dia ada different kind of rules ah only the twenty percent will be selected you can mingle
err out of that twenty they have to be in their table oh but mungkin maybe masa tu policy belum start ah tapi I went to the Grand Mercure right and err
kalau ada COVID infection ah
okay I see but only worry like err yang table yang tak mingle boring ah duduk tengok each other makan cannot mix with the you know
kalau ah
pasal your wedding lain tau your wedding can mingle is a is different cause err your time can be taken ah you know speaking ah
simple simple hmm okay kalau ah
kalau if I
hmm okay okay oh I itu yang category macam err emcee ah yang macam too much lah that's why
I kena fikir juga pasal ni
that is one thing then ya baju you all buy the fabric then make at the joo chiat right
some more is if my date considered is during the syawal tau so have to do it early okay okay lagi apa lagi eh
pasal is it pasal melayu punya photographer oh oh ah
ya nasib baik dewi is not so
you ada kawan
yang boleh yang ada recommend recommend
for photography I tak tahu seh really I
oh ya pandai apa apa pose yes yes
kirakan macam know how to live up the atmosphere then ya
tapi the that time your punya photographer is the that guy is not that good
younger guy was good he was very err dia punya social skills good ah
ya tapi at least dia tahu I mean ya
okay ah terperanjat gue sial lah
err lepas the normal ambil gambar on the dais lepa stu after lunch or
cause I remember you ada macam speech eh tak ada eh so everything

and you're like okay dah settle settle settle you know you know you know he's got the swagger you know he's a bawler you know like damn this guy goes in and that's it man the game is over
so that's why mourinho selalunya dia nya team err their possession their possession stats are usually quite low right okay
klopp and mourinho ni macam dorang macam opposite sides of the spectrum ah in a way ah
apa swan eh swan swan and harry kane
sun sun ke swan
okay ya lah I mean it's like it's like championship manager ah right oh no no best is the best is like FIFA what am I saying okay okay sorry sorry aku dah lupa defence ni apa
how do you how do you play it on Android on your phone aku
okay lah takpe lah anyway ah I don't want to get myself involved in another addictive thing ah cause you know I've just uh
I've I've recently gotten addicted to a few things on Netflix already and on Apple so pada aku macam
I I like what Netflix does these days eh dorang ada macam ranking for the programme stuff so like if you are watching from singapore they will tell you like what are the good shows it's not what are the good shows that are singaporean me in like a moulmein high for instance
sial lah bro that one macam for life for life for life I will be like when I watch moulmein high right I will be like
kau zuleika zulkifli actually likes this bloody show this poor excuse on my television program
tell all documentary ah an anelka and his life you know like you know how he converted to islam you know and then what he's currently doing you know the the clubs that he has played at everything macam basically
aku rasa nama dia macam gitu ah I mean he's muslim name is supposedly bilal but okay anyway I mean it doesn't focus too much on the religion on his religion but more on like the funny
like one was the the france punya
and macam pada anelka it was not fair ah like for him to be made ya for him to be singled out so okay so anyway
okay so so so basically macam I've watched cobra kai I've watched err I mean I don't tend to watch the series ah I would watch like documentaries or macam movies ah so like social dilemma was another thing I watched recently which was pretty interesting ah
err social dilemma is basically this documentary that I mean everybody's talking about this documentary now uh it's about how macam Facebook Instagram all these all these you know the social media giants kan dorang basically
dorang tahu like what attracts you what what you're interested in uh
so dorang buat macam uh and if not an avatar they like what do you call it lah
to all these third party you know it's it's not that it's more like macam they they use your data to know what hooks you and that's why macam Facebook becomes like you know it becomes personalise it becomes something that you are addicted to
sia ah why do they think this way sia asal dorang fikir macam gitu like dia
kau how can people just support sia macam tak masuk akal but actually the problem is the people who are supporting they are being fed information that fits their worldview you see okay so so it's a very like ya lah usually it's either very insidious thingy ah
so he seen all like atrocities of war so he's kind of like macam lost his faith a bit lah cause one of the themes of the movie
after he has a son of his own he starts to macam go back to
like worshipping god ah no macam macam it's like it's like suddenly he
feels drawn you know it's like macam ya lah orang beragama pun macam
kau ada kau punya turun naik gitu that sort of thing so macam mungkin dia tak sembahyang for like five years lepas tu dia macam eh astgahfirullah aku kena qadak balik solat aku
ya so so so that's a tragedy macam something happens and then after that he he has this macam love hate relationship with god and then his son who's growing up is looking at this you know and observing it and then the son also grows up
to have that kind of like macam ah
you know that twilight fella lah huh ya the glittery vampire so dia yang sekarang
okay shouldn't stereotype err pastor dorang
okay lah so it's an lah it's not the Android box yang Android box yang sikit hari aku pergi rumah kau kau ada kan tu benda kan
no he was in house of cards and and err house of cards the final season just macam tergantung macam gitu apa
ya so so so basically I think this is what's happening mungkin sekarang dunia sekarang cause of all the
religious upbringing to say like eh ni benda salah sia what am I doing you know that sort of thing so macam I mean that's probably why you see all these peeping toms in
no lah no no no no no I mean there that if there was it would have been a big thing and it would have been like macam it won't have been like once every few months ah which is the situation you find it you find now ah
dia panggil kau sir but asal dia masuk lagi siang dari kau seh
check it out I I was wrong okay lah I mean I think I can tell this to the camera eh to the camera pula to the recorder okay I was from serangoon right
ya I mean when he when it came out in the news the first thing we did was to share in the WhatsApp group and then we were like asking like ini aizat adam ni semua like eh ya eh eh you guys remember this guy ya ya ya he's from our school dulu
I don't think you will he's a he's just a random chinese dude lah but but macam
and he was in a class where he was in a class where cause there were there were not that many uh malays in so like there were some classes which were purely chinese lah macam you won't find a malay chap in the in that class ah
I'm I'm sure I'm sure the article is still somewhere on the straits times nanti aku google aku check kan lepas tu aku aku aku forward dekat kau lah
so you know you can you can you can know about the monsters that uh inhibits our society ah but basically ya lah back to what we were saying macam aku rasa that's where you know we are I mean just looking at our generation and comparing it to our parents generation you cannot really see
there's a lot of difference apa betul tak like
ya macam one thing about us mungkin err compared to kita punya parents eh macam kita kahwin lagi lambat abeh kita tend to macam mungkin ada lebih mata air dari mak bapa kita you know like our parents aku rasa dorangnya generations is like kau kenal ni satu perempuan
within a few months tunang another few months kahwin you know that sort of thing
what was that so so so you see eh macam what ondre said is like that was our parents I mean our grandparents is completely different ah you know like my mum my grandmother like thirteen fourteen years old she was like married off to the husband without even knowing who her husband was
but ya I mean that was that was the case ah macam like oh it was a norm ah like oh your father will just marry you off you know when the time is right ya exactly so so like
like if you are a man of twenty one twenty two back there then you are okay kau dah kerja kau dah ada hasil sikit or maybe you're an immigrant like my grandmother they got married to both my grandmothers got married to pakistani migrants ah you know so macam like
orang pakistan kat sini will be like
okay you you you you you know you you you form part of our group now ah so maybe kat masjid ke jumpa dekat kedai kopi ke apa then talk talk talk eh I got a daughter you know
that sort of thing ah macam it was it was that sort of environment where the girl doesn't even have a say as to who she's married to ah but of course I mean
I think I think for you also that time you mentioned that macam err syed ahmad was interested in your mother
um okay so what was that okay so basically macam ya that's if you see that from one generation to the next definitely that relationship between men and women is changing ah so macam kadang-kadang aku pun ada fikir sia eh anak aku
I think girls these days they are like lagi beza dari kita macam in the sense that they are really pressured to
susceptible to this ah macam kita semua pun ada macam ikut-ikut orang apa in a way lah but aku rasa untuk wanita ni
dorang lebih senang dipengaruh ah pada aku ah ah like compared to guys ah macam I mean like you mean like when I got married also I realised my wife macam
ah kau nak kahwin dekat masjid kau tak ada nak ada walimah you know that sort of thinking you know
where they provide a place for you to do the walimah kan
a still somewhat rare for the whole majlis from front to end to be held in the mosque but of course nowadays you have places like masjid mawaddah
no but bartley is like macam bartley is is is so called not really
I'm trying to say is that macam nowadays you have instances where people do say like eh should we have our majlis in a mosque cause then like orang nak sembahyang and all that it's easy for them that sort of thing and then ya it's like macam it's a it's a nice place to you for you to have your wedding what you know in a way lah but of course
pada aku pun aku rasa macam if I could have done it again maybe I would have done a walimah a small walimah outside the mosque ah
okay ah not not exactly where I wanted the conversation to go but then you okay so so macam macam pada aku macam bini aku macam that was
something that that was on her mind like macam eh why are we doing it in the mosque abeh macam like oh I want to invite only these few people and of course now because of COVID you are forced
to have a small wedding like you can't have a big wedding but but I mean but pada aku macam like and same like when I wanted to buy my house which was a three room flat people were like
eh why you buying a three room flat sia it's so macam aku rasa macam I think I've I've put my wife under a lot of pressure ah I've I've I've subjected to a lot of like questioning ah
you know landed correct correct but I think in a way macam at the end of the day you just have to be
ya huh ya ya aku dah end of this month eh end of this month eh end of this year dah enam tahun
aku fikir aku nak upgrade to macam five room ke ah
sengkang juga
bro bro tampines mahal bro tampines mahal gila no no no I'm I'm going to stay near my parents
so tak ah tu abbas nya parents aku sengkang apa
basically basically okay basically basically sengkang right it's divided into a rivervale compassvale anchorvale and fernvale lah so for those people who don't know sengkang you know is divided into this so called macam four districts gitu lah so err anchorvale and fernvale is separated by this sungai lah
it's called the sungai punggol I think ah so like if you look out my window here you can see the sungai ah
so that sungai punggol err is the boundary between sengkang which is held by the workers' party and ang mo kio which is held by pinky work
you should talk to my cousin abbas ah who lives down the street cause he was the one who told me eh kalau kau suka breaking bad kau kena watch this better call saul lah
so aku macam aku ada tengok ah like like a
I think I watch like season one season two I mean there were parts where it was already addictive but after a while aku macam how many seasons are there oh my god breaking bad only has five seasons
no I I I think I think I watched up to that point where abang dia yang very afraid of electricity or some shit like that right
okay I I think roughly around at that point aku dah macam
kan there was one point where the brother suddenly like he he he I for some reason it was like a miracle dia macam terus didn't have that
a psychological thingy so he just ended up like going into the office and I think he didn't want the ya lah but he kept on macam like downplaying si jimmy nya achievement ah dia macam cakap you'll never amount to anything that sort of thing kan
and the witcher ke apa witcher witcher pun aku tak tengok sangat
eh prison break si dia tu dah mati kan the actual dah mati kan the guy who plays michael scofield lah
okay let me google this michael scofield mati
so is season five good or not dorang ada tulis prison break season six lagi tak ah
the movie was not on the ni ni kan the movie was on siapa eh only the final break
shucks ah ikram stop getting me hooked back on all this crap lah malas sial nak pergi tengok ni semua
oh my god stop sia kau
aku bilang kau aku aku tak boleh aku tak boleh once I see macam satu benda ni ada four five seasons kan
aku terus lemah ah aku macam no lah I cannot watch this sia
the the code will come out I just scan and cause I'm using the singpass punya app
mine is after iPhone eight lah basically boleh ah so so so it's one of those things that I don't know ah Apple fan boys are talking about these days ah
double double tap then the code keluar
the scanner the scanner the scanner keluar not the code the camera thingy ya
double tap then the no you don't need to press anything double tap and then your that that square will come out and you just aim it at the code ah macam ni kau tengok ayatul kursi
no no no that's that's if you can lah kat bawah tu kan
then it goes ayatul kursi
there kat bawah kat bawah sini
can you see or not it's like when you follow you follow this dia macam go
so uh inshallah with ah I also reciting ayatul kursi we will get our twenty dollars and err we can spend it on a steak later at jalan kayu
shall we talk about our favourite makan places since it's almost lunch
tempat makan aku tahu ada tempat makan sana ah
tapi I've never heard of it being described as a good place lah
babe aku pun aku pun I know I know err anchorvale
dorang ada the vending machine cafe ah if that's what you are referring to
the yassin kampung kau pernah dengar yassin kampung
yes so yassin kampung they have this off shoot called lepak one corner
the worst name you can have for this particular place cause it's the place where you cannot lepak one corner it it doesn't feel like the lepak place ah it feels like you just go in kau beli makan dekat no the thing is what know you can't even sit down to get the waiter to come and serve you you have to
okay ya good joke but ah so then macam apa tau dia macam tempat makan dia eh dia macam okay kau kena masuk abeh kau kena macam queue up dekat the stall ah so it's like a hawker stall ah it's like a hawker centre
hawker centre you don't sit down and the fella comes to you right you got to go to the stall and order like abeh kau kena pergi sana order then after that you got to get ready your cash cause you got to put it into that stupid machine obviously these days nobody wants to touch cash so you put it into the machine they will dispense your change
then after that makanan dia okay lah not bad lah but pada aku macam so so juga but it doesn't have the lepak feeling lah
because like pada aku lepak feeling macam kau kau duduk then like eh bhai teh tarik lagi satu ah eh if you want to go place you should go to mahamoodiya
yes the one next to the Shell eh dorang dah up market sia
then aku realise
mahal sia it's like seven hundred dollars for the one that we are going ya is because it's the apa last week of the year what
kan then aku tak tahu macam mana like we need to have more options I guess
but unless we go for the apa ah smaller rooms ah
that one untuk yang the suite room so aku rasa macam besar sangat I mean we don't really need a that big of a room right no but I think can go for the smaller rooms
aku rasa boleh ah but I think it's about dalam empat ratus gitu
aku rasa ah
ya I think aku rasa for now empat orang but
the price confirm makin mahal
botanic gardens theme ah the boy bunga theme
oh ya dia belum decide right
prime is hard to find you know there's only like berapa jer dalam singapore ni tau nak cari
kipas oh it's at terrence's house now his house got two fans you know sebelah-sebelah leh like one black one white I don't know why if you want both right the whole dining table that can fly away like that it's so strong
ya bodoh so big sia
ya so what is just the four of us ah xing jing oh no with the others right because we doing dinner dengan yang lain-lain kan malam so
kau plan lah then kau bilang kita then we will just decide I mean we will just a vote
ya they bodoh
this is christmas so tak payah lohei
I think dinenr can go all out lah I guess not all out as in macam terus
apa sakan ah but more like a
no there is there is buffet but you cannot like it's not serve lah I mean like it's not open and you have to order from them so it's like a la carte kind so you keep on ordering from them then the makanan will dia ada server will send to you yes I know right ya so I think it's not a good time for buffet
he kena bullied
what what do you mean location kena change you mean the buffet town run away or what
for the dinner dia orang boleh eh
um terrence I haven't check with him yet tapi aku rasa maybe dia tak boleh because that week he's going back to school already
there's only fifty percent right now like people using it and the token collected and they need to be at least macam tujuh puluh percent untuk
dia orang go to phase three lah so
more than five even though your request for separate tables only unless you are a family members lah yang tinggal dalam serumah right
okay also like like terrence friend have a christmas punya dinner kan
so aku tak tahu ah macam mana like
bo pian lah kan macam tak boleh apa
I mean technically it's not even a macam public holiday on that day right
I think he never go there before so you should be safe dia tak ada benchmark untuk tempat tu
then the next morning he will aku rasa go to the work straight
so the tuesday morning aku rasa he has to go back to work lor
cause I remember I ask my friend for monday tuesday punya time slot I mean err rates ya
masih ah kau taiwan
ya it was that one I go on march it was macam sejuk ah tapi macam just like aircon kind yes
the he say macam apa like
he's not going they are not going to macam vaccinate everybody kat singapore
tak tahu save duit agaknya
apa purpose kan I mean at home technically don't wear mask also
so kalau anak dia dapat mak dia dapat they can just spread to each other lah
oh cactus cactus yang kecil-kecil gitu eh then
dua cactus
no the normal cactus yang besar dia ada thorns then macam bulat-bulat gitu and dia punya shape
straight then bulat-bulat eh right ya isn't it a normal desert cactus
kau siak ah hey mahal pokok tu
kau tanam pokok durian jer lah
the experts say lah the lockdown causes more macam apa problems than benefits ya
macam dulu dia tak pakai grab but sekali now oh I need to have a grab account like you know so it
it pushes them to do it lah rather than kau tahu macam kalau tak ada COVID like everybody is still
macam oodle the oodle eats like that ya it came out about during also got famous because of this so
okay lah aku rasa
ya but but they are given trainings you know and they were even even like given grants and money untuk
aku rasa okay lah
bagus lah kan macam macam semua orang jual apa jual apa what's that famous thing they make during lockdown
everybody become a chef kat rumah kan semua buat dalgona coffee macam kau
you will just stuck at home with your family lah you got no choice but just to interact dengan dia orang like
but although yes I agree that it can be quite a challenge because like kalau kau baca that time the news they say like domestic abuse cases on is on the rise was on the rise because
then aku rasa like I think they dia orang tak concentrate more much on the emotional part of a lockdown like they just implement without thinking of
I mean during the even like dia punya apa
so they don't really care about that part aku tak tahu but
it just go without the track what sia bodoh
iya lah confirm ada lah
they're gonna released back into the wild it's gonna cause like a major disrupt to the ecosystem then macam suddenly kau dalam hutan tu kau introduce monyet kau introduce pangolin kau introduce lemur pelanduk I don't know what or it released dolphin into the forest you know
ya ni bukan library tau kau taruh lepas tu kau taruh balik kat tempat asal kau ambil tau
so they have to kill or macam that one lah like what chicken flu like that eh bird flu chicken flu
sekali coronavirus from plants leh
kau masih tau
I only need to buy one plant untuk taruh dalam office aku
but actually mati a very terrible death to do
ya sia kau teruk sia
then we got scraping benda tu
aiya the typical kau tahu jemputan selalu dapat pokok tu dia orang taruh kat pasu
dia macam coconut tree but it's not
what is it called eh yang
it's not coconut tree yang pokok-pokok yang
fern gitu is it look like a fern
tak lah serious
ya usually events that kind of pokok lah you know like those
standard pokok I don't know
it's the typical pokok at events you know
yes that's one thing pokok pisang
the youngest means macam early twenties twenty two ah wow I feel old now
you got listen to misteri jam dua belas or not
huh tak ah aku tak berani I mean aku takut kena kacau sekali tu aku dah takut ya eh I think I told you right that time then ya I was studying at home I think I was twelve ah I was studying at home right then the the
eh you let's listen together no no I add sound effects what the hell I mean you know my place my areas sana banyak keras kan shit lah
dulu eh kau tinggal situ
wait your house is dekat fuchun fuchun primary baru ke fuchun primary lama is it near marsiling primary

I I only went to the old fuchun for apa tu for uh orientation I was like my first year in my primary school because but my first my first uh my first year in primary school was at the new one it's just that when I orientation it was at the old one
I don't know but I remember I think I think your parents apply for primary school then they give you like macam mana I think you bid when I think it's bidding right is it by bidding or something no I think for uh apa tu pun sama kan uh the kindergarten I think because my sister she did the same thing I think she bid for placement
so it's not enough place they'll put you another place ya they said fuchun was uh one of the best primary schools there a lot produces a lot of uh apa they say a lot of high scorpions and which is true ah
old uh old fuchun was haunted new fuchun was okay lah I mean it was not as keras
like apa evergreen they didn't have like brownies it was red cross or then there was then I was like mm okay lah red cross sounds like similar sekali I join aku join
I mean it wasn't hard I mean I join I enjoyed it it was just different because brownies was like uh buy my cookies you know like uh uh was an elf or like a pixie you know then you will learn how to cook learn how to sew but brownie was like was really like you know footdrills ya they really make sure you do so like you're you know you like ya because you had to do evacuation and things like that first aid my specialty was red cross knowledge history basically like the history we learn we had to learn about apa tu the founder lah things like that apa tu
I only had apa eh
kesian got try got try
masak we we learnt how to not really it's like nutrition is a bit like like like nutrition ah like our current nutrition class it's just that was more they they need more hands on cooking
had to cook ya I had to put during fasting month batal sia legit terbatal puasa aku I was like unconsciously I was like hmm rasa masin tak shit ya I was like ya oh my god oh no then I was like am I supposed to spit it out my friends was like ah batal jer lah then I was like alahai shit lah tak sengaja then ya you can okay lah I mean I felt guilty for like I was like okay lah batal batal lah it's fine I ganti anyways
err like basically musical theory then they taught us to play recorder pianica entah
I was in charge of the gong but it's like apa tu
but I was late once and they had to switch me over or something then I change it's like ya the drum is like I forgot what's the name of the instrument but it's like one side is smaller one side is bigger then ya I wanted to use the kompang kompang you know or the or the small one no not rebana it's the it's the long one then it's like it's the you know you know apa tu
err pontianak harum sundal malam you know the long one the metal with the round thing at the top ya then ya I wanted to play that that's a part of gamelan gamelan is the name of the whole thing what orchestra bukan xylophone panjang-panjang wait ya it's something like xylophone lah ah bulat-bulat
ya lah I had to uh I had to masuk gamelan play guitar piano had to learn piano apa tu ha they made us dance they made us fusion dance then uh contempt I was like oh my god do I look like I can dance hmm
I'm more of a musician ha me is not uh apa tu dancer you know saya bukan penari ya I was like okay ah apa tu then for sports we had to learn floorball in primary school floorball
then apa tu
played a lot lah we played a lot I was good at sports but when you know you had to run around like run around the field you know to warm up I'm like orh tak nak tak nak tak nak then it's like
qiam jer
ya it was rumah orang kan
buat bodoh jer
primary five then secondary school sec two you know always they had the night walks right it was at the you know those really old camps did you watch okay you watched incredible tales right you saw yang you know about the the the the
kena like kena jalan lah macam dia orang tarukkan glow stick kan lepas tu
dia orang apa tu dia orang bagi kau jalan dengan the first person kena pegang dia punya torchlight then yang belakang tu you know then macam kena taruk tangan atas bahu
caterpillar gitu ha I was usually either the first or the last one because I wasn't scared you know I'm not scared lah so but the weirdest thing you at what for some reason once kan what happened was aku tengah like everything was okay like it it started out fine
when we went to the camps when we tried to come back to the campsite lah so basically after the uh night the first mission night walk right then they had a briefing then tepuk ah something like that we walked back to the campsite that I somehow tripped tripped but I didn't really trip because it was
but the what weird like apa tu
benda yang pelik yang terjadi kan actually selepas tu
like so basically kan like okay so I was injured so I I fell so I I sprained my ankle kan so yang dia punya faci dia kan the eh no a teacher wanted to take a shorter cut lah because I was injured right so they uh they brought three of us took the shorter cut by the time we sampai dia punya campsite kan
I don't know they they they were getting ready to eat apa tu supper eh ya then they showered already then one of my friends like err apa tu where where did you go lah right why you said I thought you take shortcut oh why you take so long ah I'm uh then aku macam
aku tak tahu sia
I don't know I don't know it didn't feel very long it felt like it was short but the problem is when we reach everyone was either showered or the last few are showering you know that kan so you can you think do you like people shower you you get the girls and all lama juga lah kan ha lama juga so I was oh my god until now I can't figure out what happened but ya
it's near a madrasah also right
why would you put your kubur there tanah ah
kampung sia what I'm weird is one thing that is that in the hustle and bustle of the city
macam kampung pula kan
no I think they know because I went to search up on you know where to visit you know we we always do those visits right and I was searching where to visit ah then I saw this one place they said kubur melayu tengah-tengahnya apa tu kat bugis juga I think
like beside that's why when the moment you said oh kat bugis right then I was like is it near the near the madrasah and when you said yes I know about this story it's quite famous lah I mean who would think
kan I mean the only time I experienced that was that time kampung lah
aku nak pergi surau because I used to I used to stay over at my pakcik's house right and
my pakcik and makcik orang malaysia right orang malaysia kau tau lah rumah dia orang kat kampung-kampung kan so one one of the kampung is kalau nak daripada surau dah habis solat nak kena jalan balik tu kena lalu kubur
okay lah okay it was fine it was fine it was because you know you pergi surau you won't go alone what especially because I budak singapore kan mana orang nak bagi anak pergi sana especially because malaysia you know ah there's a lot of those cases right so
banyak ah bukan culik jer habis
so it's like I mean seram is seram but yang paling seram is one of my uncle's house dekat ni jalan tan kee it's kat eh but I think they move ah already it was damn dilapidated
it's like the area was macam it was how to say ah they want to
pecahkan they want to pecahkan and nak buat rumah baru but it's like dia orang tak nak move because they were miskin kan so it's like apa tu
like as a kid I was like entah I don't know but it smelt really bad so as a kid you know biasa lah you know very particular right so tak nak tak nak masuk tunggu dalam van but we me and my cousin got stuck in the van the lock rosak ya they had to send it to a kedai to get it fixed but anyways lah so basically it's like you know it's the really old kampung type like you want shower right must go out ya it's under the pokok then my mum was like when I was showering with my mum my mum was like jangan tengok atas
pokok kekabu weh
no it's open air it's zinc oak lah it's just a zinc panels sebelah kiri kanan habis you know it's the dia punya tempat air dia orang simpan air kat tempayan you know those
ya it's like you know those kimchi kimchi jars yes they put water in it dah rupa baldi tau habis dah lah air sejuk
aku nangis sumpah aku tak berani aku tak berani pergi toilet sorang-sorang tau aku kalau pergi toilet masa kat kampung ibu ibu pergi ibu pergi lah sorang ibu no I'm not going to go alone toilet dah lah kat luar tengah-tengah malam masa tu nak shower sorang-sorang you know you imagine my family from singapore all the way to all the way to malaysia kan then you take bath all the way then melekit kalau tak tak nak solat lagi
ya but I mean I shower because it was with my mum but imagine if I was I was alone I will not shower I don't know how my sister went to shower alone oh my god dah lah masa tu tengah ada case apa tu you know they masa that one is early two thousand still got case of apa tu orang minyak ke apa kan something like that
pengamal pengamal they they they practise like magic no they amal it like
you you know how some you know how some people buang dia orang punya pad darah dia orang kan dia orang nak lawa kan dia orang nanti ambil dia orang baca-baca dia orang ambil dia orang punya darah uzur tu dia orang taruk kat muka dia orang baca-baca that's how lah dia orang amal lah macam orang ya because like you know how they simpan jin simpannya hantu raya simpannya simpannya cik kak kan apa
balik kampung no
no I don't know I don't know eh I think I don't know eh is it I also don't know but I I still don't know the difference I only recently found out all the difference between langsuir and pontianak
oh yang nenek tu eh
bomoh eh
is it the makcik bomoh that one that episode
ya the one that the guy potong kuku malam-malam then the guy the other guy bukanya payung dalam rumah kan ya ya why what's your question
apa apa no penanggal penanggal lain do you realise it's the same thing because nananggal is the philippines term for penanggal penanggal is melayu
you will realise that okay you realise that a lot of the folklore right it's similar because we live in the same region you know if you check our genealogy kan philippines indonesia melayu orang orang singapore yes correct we are all basically the same ethnicities just that because of the you know the like they they split up and things like that aiya anyways but ya it's actually the same folklore lah
that's why you said lady in white right for us it's pontianak you were saying
oh one of the one of the oh it wasn't in the it wasn't in the oh ya ya ya ya ya the penanggal yang takde so basically the apa tu the organs that one right ya it's not a joke my dad used to oh ya you know I I did the interview right so basically uh for our interview for the coding in school right for class so my dad actually used to work for telcom
you know zaman dulu is yang apa tu tali dia hanging kan kat atas it wasn't underground like now kan ya so basically singapore ha kat kat malaysia tak lah kat singapore lah so basically like apa tu they had to change dia punya lines kadang-kadang kalau kadang-kadang dia uh telephone lama dia orang kan rosak then he was one of the people who go and repair
ya it was ah it's technician ah electric punya technician so basically what happened was that you know if you tukar senja-senja you'll see sometimes the penanggal head will get stuck at the at the hanging lines
no how to say eh penanggal is not really macam it's not like hantu raya it's not like pontianak it's not dead oh it's practice they say eh they pengamal they like orang minyak kan amal black magic so it's like apa tu
ha they practise ah but I don't remember what was the reason I know I know err orang minyak is to be good looking or something
I don't remember I think he was ugly or something then he say that he wants to like he was sick of people making fun of him or something aku tak ingat right no no no he made a made a perjanjian dengan syaitan then to like to make himself look handsome LOL then that's called something called plastic surgery sia plastic surgery
but like I kind of understand because when you work with not bomoh lah but you work with syaitan right it's natural I guess I mean the fact that you don't have
entah lah suka hati kau lah nak
oh dia nak makan anak dia I think
oh awet muda
you know the story about the there are like people I remember one of the incredible tales and actually it happened if you I don't know if you notice but when people get uh malay people pregnant right they will put things under their what was it pillow put things at their tingkap
I guess it's kind of make sense but I mean if it was a follow ah they say that err they put because they are this one jin or ghost kan hantu kan that will actually steal the baby ya it's the same jin that you were telling me that day we were talking about that day I think
scared the heck out of me they eat the ya the rahim they they eat the janin right they that's why they say what zaman dulu maghrib jer tutup tingkap then they then they will hang like paku-paku atau punya apa tu
garam kind of I don't know this I don't know for some reason garam is apparently quite useful in like islamic practices right they use it as border ya I don't know is that I don't know is that how my dad pagar rumah or not but ya
ya they say what is it ah what what daun apa also not ketumbar but they say LOL ketumbar untuk makan there's one daun they use to like apa tu
I don't know what's the name of the daun but it's like
ya I I they say that it cleanses something no I don't remember but if I remember I'll tell you but it's like ya they say it clean like apa tu uh
anasir-anasir sihir or something like that
they said they use it for kalau orang kena rasuk ke kena rasuk kena apa tu kena hantar apa tu sihir ke they use the daun or something I don't remember this one daun they even sell sabun or like sabun because who want to buy daun and go and clean yourself
use it's the same idea as tanah liat you know so you touch pig or dog you can just wipe what ya technology ya
but ya actually a lot of the jins are quite chicken sia I heard a lot of people right need to be careful like you know people give birth right you don't know who the one who sambut the baby
I mean like I said lah the the the jin we were talking about this it eats uh it steals babies and things like that that's why they say what actually the the reason behind oh need to go back inside the house uh uh sebelum maghrib right
but ya you can you imagine the doctor when got nurse then sekali got extra nurse the one that sambut your baby oh no oh my god hell no because my mum says that it's very keras lah that's why I was so scared when I was hospitalised early this year I was like but then again new places also got things what everywhere got things what even talking about them right now confirm they'll be like oh they talking about me
ugh two bad you don't you don't go to camp sia but that time when I was like red cross in brownies I always had camps right sometimes like when you too tired I don't know whether it's a hallucination or not but I'm pretty sure I'm not because what I'm the kind right once I sleep I like if world war three happens also I wouldn't wake up I will sleep even when a bomb drops ya tidur mati ah ya then like so basically what happened was that I was awake I woke up I was groggy but I was awake I mean I'm blind lah I wear specs lah but I was awake but I saw like something at the end of my bed like standing
I was looking at it okay baca apa kau aku baca pun kena kacau that's why
baca ke tak baca it won't stop me from getting disturbed
is it but then again when you hear about like I see like all the syarahan-syarahan they say actually jin can apa tu manipulate your dreams things like that even when they actually disturb you they can't touch you they can only manipulate your mind right
I think rather than hasutan right if they can insert images in your brain when you're sleep right they can do the same when you are awake what ya so basically it's not exactly hasutan but it's more of because hasutan are words right they play with your mind ya definitely even when you see err like english like like american horror movies or things like that if you realise that most of it is just ya they play with your mind
like because sometimes I don't know some people they say what apa eh iman kuat or semangat kuat or something right then they said that apa tu
oh so since like this person semangat kuat akan disturb so I'm like ya like how my my sister lemah semangat kan so dia kena kacau instead of my father
because my kakak penakut I think no wonder anak dia pun ikut lah pergi toilet pun bushu can you open the light for me mother never open the door please lah how old already you put switch on the light lah your house also it's not like house haunted okay actually ya maybe I don't know also her house maybe haunted because I kena tap before
I was rushing it was her birthday soon so I was like I was like sewing then I was like trying on the feet lah whether it fits well the shoulders are okay I was looking in the mirror then suddenly I felt like a huge like a solid tap on my shoulder you know you can feel the tap you know and I was like I switch I turn the I turn the mirror like around then I was like I never disturb you you don't disturb me ha I want to sleep you don't disturb me and then I I just I I didn't switch off the light I went to my bed I just play the phone the whole night I don't dare the next day I went to sleep with my mum I was so scared I was like oh my god the heck tap me is different you know if it's like just khayal like if it's like uh you mean if it's your imagination right you will feel someone walk behind you or something but this one is not I felt sold tap like someone tapping my shoulder sounds like
ustaz say they cannot show themselves doesn't mean they can't touch you
oh my god have you seen the the penampakan like and the videos and like got one video right I think malaysia or something
I honestly feel that K lah the one that I I I I'm a sceptic lah like you if you post on macam kan dia orang buka dia orang macam tunjuk kan
dia orang nak views kot
I feel like I I believe more those yang macam amateur amateur ones that macam a that one scares me for real like I saw one kan and he was like
waiting for her boyfriend then they were talking talking then her boyfriend go out she go out with her boyfriend then then there's ada show that she was talking talking talking then she U-turn back go back in the room use her phone
then because singapore I feel like singaporeans by that time singapore was modernise malaysia still kampung kot
maybe dia orang tak no it's not that practice no if you realise a lot like like I said my
can I even say this though it's like like my nenek ada saka kan
but then again for malaysia even now there's people who still have saka
I I like it's hard to find people with susuk in singapore LOL they might just as well put fillers kan it's easier to find a doctor than a bloody bomoh ya that's why might as well just put on lip fillers and nose fillers then you go and find bomoh bomoh pun uh wah golden golden apa tu
uh apa tu susuk emas dalam muka saya biar biar awet muda LOL what
so leceh
for susuk or like if you jaga like if you ada saka ke apa kan kena jaga lama seh ha kain kuning lah pulut kuning ayam ayam seekor so apa tu tangga galah tangga tak boleh
I don't know I don't know I don't have susuk I don't have saka buluh kot buluh
eh tak lah payung
I don't know I think buluh has some
I don't know like how you know certain like I said daun or air garam maybe like buluh has some
dia docker ke apa metal
I don't know I mean okay but I mean if it's galah galah galah galah metal kat dalam rumah apa kalau metal kat dalam rumah apa you need to walk under the galah
but why would you walk under the galah when there's clothes dirty water will drip on you anyway
would you walk under the galah if there's like dirty clothes above your head no why would I want underwear water on my hair
I guess but then again if you do susuk probably you won't you will be more aware lah I mean zaman sekarang I wouldn't know lah tengah main handphone alamak jalan bawah galah bodoh apa the heck but ya
kau ingat kau ingat burger ke apa dah terkeluar masuk balik I mean I don't think it's so easy to remove
but I want one thing I'm I'm thinking is that what did they say once it comes out terkeluar right you because ah you become uglier
that's what they say if your your susuk keluar you become buruk
cerita hantu eh
macam botox ah it's just that botox is err it stays inside your skin
I guess so can you imagine your bomoh dies then you're you're you are no lah eh but then
nazak right I think that's I think that's common ah
so you suffer more when you die ah macam saka ah
you cannot die tenteram
they say when they leave you to put inside your kubur apa tu tujuh kaki dalam tujuh kaki wide thing
you still can feel them lowering you down and things like that they can they can feel you kafan you they they can feel them showering you things like that
it's like pakai baju biasa ah eh please lah you haven't die your clothes so thick already you wear so many layers kafan won't kill you it's just one layer you probably
probably you be shivering like alah asal dia orang tak taruk banyak cloth bodoh sejuk siol bajet ke satu layer jer tu lah pasal tapi eh dia orang kafan sampai tu apa
kain kafan all the way apa guess you have stockings
kain batik just to cover your atas jer but your kafan is all white ah
it's just to cover the face so people don't macam stare at you or something it's just macam you okay if like you eat nasi lemak will you eat the wrapper
no you will eat the rice and the chicken and the sayur all what
mayat jijik ah no but there are cases if you know right when allah tak nak terima your death kan then you apa ada the maggots or like ular atau apa tu nanah
it will push you back out or like your kubur will be filled with water things like that then I don't think the family members wanna keep either they just I think they just probably throw it away or like keep it
dia duduk balik is it
they just I I the one that I know is jangan when they say terima tak or whatever ambil beban ke apa don't just just don't say yes there's no respond
biar allah ambil beban
or may allah take your syaitan
during nazak a lot of people pass cause I heard one time
they had to open the bumbung you know zinc kampung right so they use zinc punya bumbung kan so for like when the person tengah nazak kan dia orang buka dia punya bumbung tu biar
kau ingat kau kau ingat convertible ke apa they had to climb and open it lah kau ni bodoh but ya lah they have to open the zinc bumbung then it's like let the
ya if the thing leaves ah because I think I I don't know if you saw yang jangan pandang belakang they they the thing couldn't get out so it's just sticking at the walls climbing and all until the guy terima nenek dia punya benda tu I'm so glad when my grandma never pass to my mum no it's more like the thing doesn't want my mum
because my my my mum cakap the thing
he's recording sia the thing apa tu
I don't know I don't have a I don't have a saka
I don't have a saka I'm a sucker but I don't have a saka you get me but ya it's like um
don't have worldly desires tak tamak tak apa tu tak jahat tak tamak tak jahat uh apa tu
basic willing to help people gitu ah sincere lah so maybe like
it pick my grandma because of that but none of my pakcik makcik and my mum because my mum was definitely money money money my mum wow she went out to work work work work she said she had no life she that she did nothing but just work I ask her what's her hobby it's work

that was you you are being told to sleep there kita takkan suruh kau tidur situ the three of us sleep on the bed but if let's say the bed is a king besar right then we
we tidur macam
macam mana uh kita tidur melintang
means kita tak kita tak tak ikut cara
boleh eh aku pernah buat aku nenek aku dan kakak aku pergi holiday kita
kau jangan aku tak suruh kau tidur dekat bench aiyo
a'ah betul tak payah fikir banyak-banyak eh
actually aku tak tahu kau cakap apa tadi aku cakap jer
tapi tapi tu kau kena bawa as in the hassle is we have to be
okay I I think you can get at nanti aku tag but I don't know when I'm going
maybe Daiso punya is for
oh because I know that it the trend is macam you know like like baru-baru ni ah orang baru nak cycling
ni pasal ah
okay lah ini semua pasal COVID lah orang semua
cari cari apa kegiatan eh
kegiatan eh
ah riadah seh
eh uh apa tu ah next year ah we do something
actually I'm supposed to go out just now to collect something then I tell the person can I come tomorrow instead cause like I saw the it's scorching hot then I was like ah apa aku boleh buat productive hari ni okay kemas bilik
tak sweater lah this is this is not sweater this is
no it's tak tebal it is tak tebal
okay I guess so it's gonna be the same thing maybe entah bah
wait wait wait so kirakan like you land in Singapore and then after that they give you the mask or like err
ya we top we we top the rank ah isn't it we we top the list for the the number of corona virus cases tu lah pasti
but by that time um we actually had we we we travelled quite a bit before like kita pergi Bangkok for like satu minggu holiday
even though like you know there were threats of um like you know this unknown virus being spread around lah tapi
we went to Japan habis habis lepas tu was like that was when it was more heightened initially we were like thinking nak pergi ke tak nak pergi ke tak pasal
dia pakai dia the kind macam dia pakai mask
habis like in the aircraft when you know when we are all confined in in a uh metal tube with like hundreds of um other people like he will refuse to wear dia punya mask and I'm like
aku tak faham so anyway
sorry so ya begitu lah but ya then after that it's like err
uh they took unpaid leave and then after that err I I I tanya dia orang lah like eh so what's the deal now are we are you getting fired or like are you staying on err what's the situation cause it's like
you know it's very uncertain then dorang cakap macam eh kau lucky sia kau um um you left at a very good time and then I'm like
but ya macam begitu ah and err like you I'm also looking for a job but getting there but the good thing is I'm studying
you do you remember that um the viral video that fiasco the whole Ateeqah Mazlan punya benda that was super funny
she need to gain sale you know technically okay I mean like you know she put she put her nose where it didn't belong so it kind of like macam padanlah muka dia
cause it's like I know I know like she means well but it's like why do you need to go and call up siapa is it or something is it I can't remember
ya habis tu apa macam like she called them and then she tries to get like answers from them dia macam nak dia berniat nak
dia I think I think her niat is not to like viral like be like isn't like to to make to close down home based business but it's more to like
spread awareness of like the current regulations that are in place um apa eh
uh like the current regulations that are in place mm related to home based business begitu
tak satisfy is like an understatement because dorang I mean like you know like melayu punya backlash is like next level dorang macam like oh err
err dia ni dia ni dia ni nak apa nak tutup
kan as in what do they say uh they said something about like err nak tutupkan err nak kacau periuk ah
periuk nasi orang something like that I don't know but it's so like ya it's well meaning but misplaced
dia macam kena dia tak kena pulau dia kena kecam dia kena kecam gila babi so funny
okay I did not think that it was our good friend Hadi pasal si
of course lah I mean like it it I mean he is an unsung hero I mean like during the whole like during COVID eh sorry during it's like people will stuck at home okay lepas tu diorang semua nak kena makan kan
and then half the time like for me my family everybody stuck at home so my mum macam frus
dia orang masih kerja like you know I mean they are adjusted out there you know I mean like more than uh more than ever and like
it's still a kerja ah kerja tu kerja lah but like you know
because it's like I had to leave for dinner after that but like they they they they featured like some macam
the apa tu barang barang for the err how do you say the the items for the supermarket kan
how how long is that show two hours is like dua jam I don't think you can like squeeze everything together lah
highly taxing job for example kan macam like in a family a a low income family of like for example dia punya anak dia err anak dia special needs kid
habis lepas tu the parents are like you know they got retrenched or something and then they're older habis dorang tak ada they don't have the means to go and rent a car and stuff like that there's still a lot of things to consider
people who are like who are eligible for like macam help because for whatever reasons they earn
more than like slightly more than the the particular um like income ceiling for example and then after that like macam err
a lot of thought in it but I just cannot encapsulate it in words so is like macam you know like when you when you read something and then you have thoughts
so is like ya I don't know and we talk about like a couple of different topics also sometimes so macam I guess
well not really as in like I I at school during circuit breaker circuit breaker's thirteen April right so it was a interesting time for me like err because err apa
and then after that they started to implement like a lot of different measures and then it was very leceh pasal like you know because
there were at least macam twenty people in the class then after that like err we
you know home based learning and then after that we were the only ones who are still not doing home based learning so macam kita very move very FOMO
and this was the very funny part so kita orang punya exams we  kita ada dua exam like
for for one research module and another one eh apa eh
we were revising and basically we were revising based on err what the exam usually entails lah macam like
like like ada ada open ended and stuff like that and you based on like going to school and sitting for the exams then COVID happened
err so that time nak like in the end we for the first time in my life actually I did an online exam can you imagine back in when I was working ah
uh there was one there was one module there was one module where they say it was closed book tapi kita orang macam like
eh get real lah kau ingat apa kita orang tak akan you know go on Whatsapp lepas tu kita text eh kau tahu tak what's this what's the answer for this but in
so it's like um basically we were err there are there are like three different kinds of exam so macam like open task
so macam like we get on we we all got go online lepas tu we all sit down together
buka tu link duduk for two hours ku duduk situ
kau buat tu err exam just like a normal exam tapi err ni in the comfort of your own home  begitu
well nothing because okay for that macam the time exam kan the time exam is like you cannot hire anyone to do it for you
so it's like it's the thing where I mean like ada forty eight hours exam that I had recently it was like
ha you memang betik
I enjoyed my life met so many many different people habis lepas tu like now err bila I'm like more settled a little in life sort of
but like for for uni it's a bit more difficult especially now pasal like err how to say this like um I'm much older than I was obviously
dia pandai tahu dia pandai she graduated from mass comm eh no she graduated from advertising
Ngee Ann similar course tapi dia punya dia punya
distracted tak tak boleh tahan so I had a project before just like macam like maybe two weeks ago ya so dia sibuk dengan dia punya boyfriend punya birthday
habis lepas tu dia punya kerja macam you know it's a group work
so nak kena betul betul nak kena duduk and then discuss lepas tu nak kena tulis apa apa in a powerpoint
presentation nak kena prepare pasal kita orang ada presentation and then after that we have to write a report also
two people writing the same report is a mess and a fact is is that kita kena buat like a very intensive research initially and then after that is like after that it's like more of like a solution finding kind of thing
I said to her okay you know what aku buat aku buat yang lit review punya part lepas tu yang lain lain semua kau boleh buat senang
so basically we had like a google docs where we had a dumping ground of like macam kita orang punya um information and everything
and then the only thing she needs to do is to just write the bottom part of the the the essay the report itu pun dia tak boleh buat
the fact the fact is like I ain't going to do that but as in like okay so dia boleh
dia boleh lah pergi mana mana like dia punya boyfriend dia punya twenty third birthday dia pergi prepare all the apa tu
gifts for him bagai can you imagine twenty three birthday presents
because is like even though when I was working tak ada chance my boyfriend has ever going to get X number of presents however old he is from me
itu part time just
we are online uh we doing online lessons right now kan so like half the time kita
um kita log-on like at 9 o'clock
us to participate know like you know breakout groups you know that kind of thing and leceh gila then I was like err
tak nak ah malas ah but like so basically like for how many weeks eight eight eight weeks um
still in my bed and then after that like when they are discussing then after that you know I'll try to make an effort to get off my bed and then after that duduk dekat atas meja lah and do my work
this semester so I macam like to be able to connect with them in a level err I mean like online everything is very cool
as in this particular Food Panda thing dia punya promo jer daripada dulu ke baru sekarang baru saja as in like err
entah lah
ha apa
kita boleh pergi pe Sentosa island or like pulau ubin ke pulau hantu ke like our friend went to pulau hantu what recently
itu itu next level I was
kejap now is like almost two o'clock ya I what's what's classes what are classes
eh thirty plus dollars compared to my twenty five thousand dollars is nothing okay diam sudah diam
no tak payah lah just stop jer
I don't know ugh I I don't have access to the the Whatsapp right now kejap eh
oh really wait wait am am I dekat now
still jauh eh
serious I'm very distant eh jap jap eh wait wait am I am I am I am I closer now
boleh lah eh
mine I would say ah alhamdulillah I'm I'm very grateful for the results cause I expected worse but I guess my lecturers were just being lenient ah
the usual physical examination like we had the the ya I mean usually we we uh our exam punya duration would be like three hours right
cause ya but but but but it's not the usual ah question answer kind of thing ah cause ya ya cause it's like um I'm taking it uh for this for this forty hours exam is like it's it's it's err what's the subject oh education secondary uh educational psychology nya subject so it's like
tu lah like err initially I was like
sorry sorry banyak kan aiya but
lima soalan jer lepastu saya harus jawab kan dalam masa empat puluh lapan jam ye puan-puan
is it macam like I I sound very distant
dengar oh faham faham
faham jer cause like
um apa tu
mm mm mm faham faham faham
bahasa melayu nusantara ya so ya I mean ya but you are taking level two right ya so ya so like she I mean it's good lah cause it's like monday until thursday
ya merdeka ya tu lah
uh cerita dia like it's about um cerita dia it's about like um this person
eh aku selama ni err dekat dunia aku aku
buat jahat jer tapi kenapa like ya tapi kenapa like she's quite dia macam like she's she's asking herself she's questioning herself like um tapi kenapa aku dekat the good place like shouldn't be ya macam like tak ke patut ya lah tak ke patut aku dekat the bad place ya but then turns out that
it's a funny show ya it's comedy it's like eh dia nya genre is like comedy
cannot ah eh ya I mean at times it's very macam cringey uh and very like cliche the storyline
ya ya ya ya it's it's done that time dorang baru habis like I think it's around
no no no no like finish for this season ah and like boleh show ah
ya so I think dia baru dia baru habis jer like this year
hmm let me think I tak tahu ah cause like you you tadi cakap kan you not easily impressed
takut eh macam dah I dah list everything dah like and then suddenly oh oh oh I mean like I have a full list of recommendations ah if you want
really ah like like I mean like what you usually do you you just scroll ke macam mana
mmhmm ah can can can at at times it can be like macam it can it can trigger your macam thoughts juga ah like macam
um faham faham I can see I can see ah ya ya ya ya
and they don't mind tau like they just put their macam opinion on the twitter out there and macam
to me it's so brave and it takes a lot of courage to do that I just cannot macam like imagine the the what the critics ah I mean I think the critics are like macam I think I I I'm usually macam scared about like
the critics or like how people will judge me after that ah basically like oh you have this kind of thought macam you know kind of thing but then ya I mean it has uh huh
can can macam there's something that stopping you kan macam err okay to me usually I would say
to me I will usually say um ya sorry to me I usually macam what's stopping me at the same time is like my baseless assumptions ah atau macam baseless thought faham ke macam I didn't do a lot of reading but this is what I thought so I'm not sure like if I should like express it you get what I mean
ya ya ya ya oh my god oh my god faham faham faham faham macam like oh you you have this kind of like ya ya ya
ya but ya I also like respect them ah like um I mean like ah as to what you said just now about like I mean let's say if macam somebody or someone doesn't really agree with that that that opinion of theirs
like they are able to actually discuss about it faham ke
like to me I think if I were to put something kan then if another person would reply then I would be so cuak already like macam okay so what should I answer now macam wonder like
kan kan kan like I wouldn't deactivate cause of that ah basically macam like I wouldn't deactivate twitter just cause I I know that like through twitter you can get uh like updates ah like and they talk about like this sensitive I mean like especially I mean the millennials right you know right
mm mm mm like macam it's very toxic eh why would they share but
true true ya I mean and how's instagram been for you though I mean ya instagram aplikasi instagram ya I mean like do you think it's overwhelming as well
tak eh
ya ya ya I mean like I think these days pun macam I asyik

in the first place dia macam
tak tahu whether she
he really cheat dekat dia ke tak eventually ah she found out ah and about the girl and everything
then there's a lot of drama with the girl cause the girl macam
although dia tahu that he is a married man dia tetap nak dengan
because the guy has always been macam
so dia the wife
then but then in the end dorang
uh cerai lah
then cerai the the wife manage to take all her wealth back
ah loving loving some falling in love is not a crime then I'm just like apa seh
now like the story I masih kat episode nine so like

but then they said that public transport is way cheaper dari
um okay lah obviously dari Grab ah tapi way cheaper daripada you
then macam whoa meaning kat Singapore vehicles are really really expensive seh
then I go and check ah satu kereta kat singapore and I'm not talking about like those nice vehicle eh like basic five car seater right
itu pun right
kalau you dapat the nice one ah usually right I think the price starts from sixty eight K
the apa eh
oh my god penthouse you know there was this article yang dorang cakap they found a helicopter
dah boleh eh fifty seven dah
orh that time you ada stop I kat lima puluh lima jer
tak ah
I dah lama tak main piano
I asyik baik-baik
main piano benda sama jer
tak tahu ah macam malas gitu nak belajar
you know I ask my colleague ah eh why you don't want to talk to me in malay then you tahu apa dia cakap
then after that he try to subtlely cakap melayu with me then I find it so cute seh
cause like he trying to say that he tak ngam with his
then he was like cause actually I never ngam with my ex-supervisor then I was like LOL LOL LOL
termenung jauh nampak then it's so weird to hear him speak malay seh but at least he made the effort
he also penat he won't talk one ah we just like so glad that then he said eh tak happy ke nak off day
what are you doing bukan how are you doing
oh ya I forgot how is your haus kau batuk lagi ke
mm cause aku perasan juga like I notice your cough in your um videos I notice that your voice is like almost gone you know and um and also like when you have kahak in your throat and then you like you need to clear it before you talk then I'm like why is she speaking like this why is she not um clearing her throat first before she talk
kenapa dia ni macam gini kenapa dia kenapa dia tak dia tak rasa sakit ke and then turns out that you've been having bad coughs like for a long time so how is it is it better now that you started your medication
susah tak nak pakai tu like how did you know how to use it did you like Google it because if it was me I would have to Google it
oh I think I think I saw that but I think I saw that like lambat
orh kalau tak kau macam tak boleh nak nak inhale like deeply ah
must be hard because actually now I'm better but I think when I was in school pun I used to have bad coughs yang dia tak teruk tapi dia lama
I have kahak so I have a lot of kahak that goes in my throat and then also in my nose like in this area so dia macam satu it's the same thing where it's like all over the place
ah so macam sekarang ni I can recognize it lah when I'm having when I'm having a sinus allergy reaction
macam at that time I think I didn't know cause ah before
actually err is a lot better that I can eat chocolate now the only thing I'm not eating right now is um tempeh
err roti kicap
I know I know no but ya I think these three yang betul betul I've been avoiding because
err at first memang I avoided everything I avoided like vitagen yakult lah yogurt I mean I still don't eat yogurt ah apa tapi macam kalau yogurt is in mm is like a flavor aku boleh makan tapi macam tak banyak lah
dia is is in at yeast allergy it's like um err fermentation is fermentation because
because yeast kan is a product of fermentation ah so macam tempeh pun aku tak boleh makan because it's like soy bean fermented
ya macam tu sebab lah is it's hard for me sometimes to detect what I can or cannot eat because macam tu lah because uh in some kadang-kadang aku makan
err apa gatal but actually you know uh when I went to clinic my it was really bad my skin was in bad condition because I just got like new macam active err areas yang gatal and everything
and he asked me if I started to eat any vitamins recently and I did I started because before that I had a very bad ah episode of sinus punya ni like selsema for like one month
so my dad told me to start err drinking yang effervescent tablets tu barakah
so I did and then he ask me I started err started drinking that and then he said that oh ya it's very bad padahal kan I look at the ingredients of the vitamin and it doesn't say anywhere that it contains um macam yeast ke apa but I guess is one of the by products when they make it
err so err tapi recently because I at first I memang betul betul jaga my diet and then I notice at this one time okay at this time is funny at that time it was like very very bad
but my aunt she forgot that I cannot eat kicap because kicap is such a common common thing kalau kau masak kan
so dia
ya ya no at that time she's making nasi goreng sambal sotong tau like leftover sambal sotong so dia letak lah kicap tu sikit just for flavour
and then I was I already ate like one full plate and then she's like aina I'm just like but I don't know how I don't remember how but she said that she put kicap and I was like
tapi I was already but you know I can I have medicine to help with the itching so malam tu aku macam aku dah ready lah untuk makan ubat
so at that bad macam is just a little bit because when my skin is not dry so the gatal pun dia kurang lah I can control it so when err after that I realise that you know I should try to because it's been
so macam I should start
trying out food yang I'm not eating
so I I drank like vitagen once and it was okay tapi aku kurang lah I don't make it a habit to drink it a lot
ah cuma sekarang ni aku tak makan roti
err kicap tempeh yogurt jer lah
actually supposed to go and see the doctor bulan enam but at that time kan I was ah I couldn't go because clinic tu dekat tangkak
ya tangkak kat johor but it's far lah
you know why because is betul betul dekat hujung
betul betul dekat hujung dekat singapore like really is like there
so macam
because especially because my house is err dekat danga bay which is
and then my window is facing the um memorial the sungei that goes like I can see the boats the fishermen boats ada kelong and then I can actually see the island of singapore in the distance
ya tapi I'm I didn't go to singapore I've never been to singapore
I used to because when I was younger kan mm kalau kitaorang balik johor
I and my parents and like their cousin and their siblings kan dorang semua dah ready bawa passport cause they would go for a not even a day trip dorang nak pergi kat dorang cari um like the juice fruit juices that are not here in malaysia some of the products juice juice
dorang some some ah dorang tak produce dorang tak hantar that brand dekat malaysia
so they will go there macam is a trip for them and then kitaorang budak-budak would be left at home it's like freedom for both adults and kids
we'll all be like so jealous wah tak dapat ikut pergi singapore and then I realize and I got older and I realised that singapore dengan malaysia takde beza
sama jer kan sebenarnya
ya it's the same I think ya sama jer it's just that you know at that time I was like wow singapore
ah that's why it's at first it was hard for me because the memang my family memang suka makan roti kitaorang we can go through like one bantal yang besar tu like two days so now substitute is wraps lah
mm so macam always ada tu or you know like prata yang frozen
ah kalau if I go to AEON I will buy the croissant
croissant croissant itu memang one of the benda yang paling kelakar
because kau dah terbiasa
ya apa
kan cousin aku kan belajar
tunggu jer lah lunch is almost lunch time
usually kau yang masak ke
um I think dia tak not used to the routine yet but as a experience based on my experience is a very good
err routine to have to moisturize and when I say moisturize kan it's not it's not just um sapu lotion on dry skin you have to be bilas with water first and then you have to pat dry and then baru you lotion because then baru dia ada moisture
ah ya ya tapi macam you know if I if I mandi awhile like
wear it bilas and then I put lotion and then is very effective kalau you moisturize it overnight
dia sendiri dia tak pandai jaga that's why you know when I was
mm but when I was younger and it was bad memang my mom would paksa
err because sometimes it hurts tau untuk mandi cause when you have open sores and then my mum would force and she would watch me
so macam masa tu kan I
ah tak tak
yang ini yang yang aku makan ni dia powder tapi dia dalam capsule
ah and then eh that time I cannot I couldn't eat pills I couldn't swallow pills pasal kau tahu uh sampai menangis like I tried to eat it until I cried
I open the capsule onto a spoon lepastu aku makan
it's disgusting tapi
maybe you should try you know work yourself up you know potong tiga ke to get used to it instead of makan powder jer
tapi dia macam faulty lah
can jap I give you the link cause I just gave it to darren but it's like
it's like uh after I register tak boleh nak log in pun
tak tahu lah dia punya website dia macam faulty tu yang si nai cakap semalam dengan doctor john
ah you when you register to use your apa punya account
try lah nanti apa I think they need to um solve on their site before they do before you can log in
I get it I get it lah but thing is kat you need like a car
ah tu jer lah I think that's that's really the only macam problem that I have
ah itu jer lah tak banyak pun tapi they haven't responded to my email
aku dia ada dia ada dia macam err inquiry box dekat website tu
ah so I I left my email and then the topic was internship and that if they receive um interns undergraduate internship apa ya program
tapi dorang tak reply maybe I need to email them directly
ya actually I I agree dorang punya one of the malaysia punya government or any authorities when punya weak link weak point is that dorang punya website is very poorly handle
ah bukan tak pandai they don't see the need
ah macam kita kan apa-apa pun kita akan website dulu ah website website
so tapi aku cari lah kat johor kat johor pun banyak juga
more opportunity banyak tempat but it's definitely gonna be far from my house lah
tapi okay lah as long as you know
yes apa ni apa aku cakap oh when I was in second year
I did go to aquaria kan aku pergi dengan shikin
and I saw um some of the stuff dia tengah macam recording record of the the fish and the the thing in the tank
macam like writing on the clipboard so aku tanya dia aku tanya dia uh kalau apa dorang ambil aquaria ni ambil intern ke lepastu dia kata dia pun intern
ya and then she said that uh apa I ask lah yang selalunya yang feeding kan yang diving and feeding tu dia kata anyone that has a diving license boleh I'm like ah
ah tu lah I wonder also
jauh lah tapi it's either you have a long commute atau you sewa rumah dekat situ lah sewa bilik
kau tahu tak fasha fasha nak buat intern kat johor
sebab uh ya lah but she wants to be close with shami dia nak jumpa lah
so this so kita orang macam dah pernah cakap sebelum ni that if she gets an internship in johor I would I mean if we get in the around same area
ha mari mari tapi johor ni kan besar so we don't know lah
mm mm tak tahu kat mana tu jer ah when I think that
macam is I'm so scared
I saw because I did see my brother going through his internship pun susah gila nak cari no no company would want
mm tapi
tapi I did see some private companies yang bagi internship not bad lah
takde I'm trying to find material for my tapi
I don't know if I can just use the paper that my supervisor bagi like
dia dia kan my old title was combining water quality dengan uh macromentoes
so I did my field work tapi since we cannot go to the lab
dia dah published dah tapi dia co author jer dia bukan the main author doctor chan lepastu dia ada data dekat tempat yang sama of macromentoes so aku kena analyse the data of macromentoes compare it to the published paper punya data
dia punya paper as a reference for my water quality part
um I think I have a I think I have an idea of how to do it lah tapi you know ha I actually finding the material for me is the hardest part
macam aku aku try the system where when I read I highlight the paragraph
pastu I go back to it and then aku akan copy paste for the whole paragraph I go I put it in my word document
pastu I try to retype it
tapi sometimes it becomes macam disjointed because you know you're taking a lot of sources and make it into one paragraph
sometimes it feels bad tapi tu lah gunanya supervisor
oh laju kali ni supervisor kau laju
last sem aku rasa macam supervisor aku jer yang asik minta ya your supervisor was so quiet
sebab haritu kan kitaorang ada meeting mentor mentee kan dengan doctor chan
uhh macam on the our presentation dia cakap
the examiners all are impressed dengan kita punya presentation
pasal our presentation wise we are all macam mantul tapi when it comes to the writing
ah writing kita ada macam slack
I think must me and my feelings pun macam gitu macam
mm sometimes aku rasa macam oh my god is he like mad at me or is he like not not so not satisfied with it tapi sebenarnya okay jer
is like we you know we have in this other lecturer yang uh
ah and tapi aku rasa macam my supervisor and your supervisor they are not the kind to dismiss that kind of questions dorang akan jawab
cause I I've had experience with it before because I did ask stupid questions ya lah sebab kita nak tahu kan we I'm I was scared of doing the wrong thing when I was going on my field trip
ah memalukan like you feel embarrassed
yang dekat terengganu eh
did you hear about the girl kat terengganu
ah yang kawan ah
wei tu gila dah
ye lepas lepastu dia boleh Whatsapp lagi macam acting as if like nothing
eh bukan bukan mak dia ada kat situ ke
mm macam ramai kan orang punya story macam banyak version
kesian dah like
wife dah lah sakit lepas tu anak dia yang anak dia yang first kan
but it's so sad lah tapi memang
ada video evidence kan that she entered the house
mm dengan apa I think like hair in her hand
tak boleh log in kan
dah tu lah I think you just wait ah because think somewhat tak boleh tak boleh
I think someone did text the yang apa doctor jaga situ puan puan lin eh
aku tak tolong masak aku tolong dia basuh jer
kan dia macam semak
orh dia panggil okay ah
my mum doesn't ask us to help kalau dia tengah masak
ah macam after tu I usually just go and see lah tapi dia kadang-kadang dia minta lah minta tolong
aku pun tapi aku kurang lah because aku kan tengok drama yang aku tengah tengok ni bukan dekat netflix
so macam is a lot of more steps to
to watch it tapi sebab you know K drama they are so long
macam kau kena tengok tu kau kena duduk situ for an hour to watch it
I didn't watch that because I saw a lot of people punya comments
but I think the K drama yang I watched that had a lot of err long episodes was prison playbook
itu kan I don't usually watch uh slice of life punya drama
I usually watch macam investigative atau medical tapi somehow prison playbook ni
it's interesting and dia kelakar
dia cam just a nice balance of kelakar dan sedih ye dia kelakar more kelakar than sedih
best tapi tu lah ada episode dia yang one one and a half hours
ni pun kalau sejam aku rasa dah lama dah
sebab you know I'm used to watching um english
english punya series english punya series paling lama pun like forty minutes jer
and then kalau comedy kalau comedy tu
lagi lah twenty minutes twenty minutes jer
that's where I really like pick up on spoken english because I used to read a lot tapi macam tak bercakap lah kan
so when I watched it I pick up on the slang and the the the pop culture the references macam inside jokes
ya dah you know masa tu kan dia kat dalam dia kat channel hallmark
and it was at eleven forty five at night every episode baru
so macam my mum was um was very strict with this about bed times ah usually macam ten tu we're ready to go to sleep
so we only me and my sister lah my oldest sister kitaorang akan sneak out untuk tengok
I don't know ah sometimes dia perasan kot tapi dia macam biar jer
I think my parents do that a lot when we were kids so that you know biar jer lah macam
let us get away because sometimes kita kena belajar lah to be
especially because kitaorang kan ramai there's like six of us
ah benda macam ni is like a small thing let it go lah
I used to macam tu lah my sister and I would break um bed time
a lot sebab kitaorang nak baca buku nak tengok
baca buku yang I don't know time at first it was bagus you know but then after a while we really like bought a lot kalau kitaorang pergi big bad wolf or sale yang like ten bucks
and then we would have nowhere to simpan and then the worst part is that we have books yang we haven't read but we want to buy new
ah banyak jer sampai sekarang tak baca
tapi my mom dah simpan semua buku dekat my grandma's house punya store so kalau nak cari balik kena cari dalam store tu but I read books on my phone now
wei kau nak dengar tak aku punya mimpi yang paling aku ingat sekarang dan paling merepek
anak dia pun ramai tau anak dia like wait eh one five or six tapi semua boys
uh the oldest one it's like us around the same age lah cuma the last one the last one beza dengan the second last one was like twelve years or something like that
uh the last one is still is still young still a child still a kid like primary school but the second youngest is our age I think so dorang handsome tau
pernah aku pernah mimpi I was marrying marrying one of them but but it's not
ya this is this is is my dream but I often memang get err
often memang get a really bad not really bad not bad dreams but they just like very weird dreams because
aku jarang tak mimpi then
yang macam banyak kali one of it I can remember is that daripada aku dulu daripada aku kecil tau masa aku dah pandai drive lagi I always dream
that's like daripada dulu lagi I've been having that that one specific dream
sampai I can imagine it now
tapi actually I
I think it's interesting tapi most of the time
I don't really remember unless I betul betul put in effort untuk remember I won't remember
ah I will that's why sometimes I wake up and I'm in a bad mood is because I had a dream yang
made me ah macam you know it's a bad feeling
apa yang what was
I don't know I don't know why we are in our last semester tapi our lecturer wants to
mm mm tu lah
sabar jer lah
bedah pun did you see her tweet
no did she replied me she said there is someone who replies the list responds to the list in a group pastu aku macam oh okay aku dah tahu dah siapa
tapi dia dapat lagi sorang siapa ah
cuma dua orang tu jer
not sure I remember dua orang tu jer lagi sorang tu I tak ingat pula wait ah I see I got I send you the picture right
cause kesian
mana eh nama dia oh ni oh dia dengan okay lah
sorang tu jer lah that's like really bad
tapi tira punya group macam best cause she got
ah cas dengan tarvin
cuma cuma sorang tu jer yang macam eh sikit
alah dia start march kan
march kita start tak tak kita start intern in march
ya march sampai july
adoi so kau kena your intern has to be there lah
orh boleh kerja ke tak
ah err january tapi
dah prepare I mean they are preparing but I don't know how much they can prepare now that cannot ah selangor tengah kan
dia macam I I asked my mum because even dorang punya engagement pun they postpone
so I asked my mom if it's still uh is still like enforce at that time and tak boleh nak buat tak boleh nak buat kenduri
my mum said nikah jer lah dulu and then kenduri we can think about it later
ya tapi dorang dah ada lah dewan apa semua they have already corresponded dengan that person for now they are planning as if there's gonna be an actual wedding
aku rasa but but because
err we know the guy we are friendly with him ya I used to do it with him so aku rasa macam I don't feel like
ah apa I don't feel like I'm losing her lah sangat
ah and then he's nice I mean we argue a lot tapi kitaorang gaduh manja manja jer because I think we have the same like almost similar personality
ah it's like we are both the opinionated and then kitaorang memang minat benda yang sama like we
apa semua so I can talk to him lah about and he's very friendly even to my family
mm casually talk to him so it's nice tapi macam you know my sister getting married
the last one tu supposed to be lelaki but
keluar perempuan so dia tak balance
but I'm grateful because I am right now macam paling rapat with my younger sister
because you know being the youngest she matures a lot more than kitaorang
form four lepastu tak tak matrix
dia adik aku yang last tu dia sorang jer dalam sekolah
kita orang semua dah ni dah
yang aisyah tu
pasal yang atas dia laki eh
tapi kalau kau tengok the difference between my sibilings I always post their pictures
Instagram hilang then stay
I'm planning to make progress on my sebab sekarang ni we don't have any
sebab yang seafood security punya assignment kita tak tahu lagi kan
mm tu jer lah
you know you know my you know my cousin yang kecil tu yang baby tu
dia baru sebelas bulan tapi dia dah boleh jalan
oh tapi rambut dia sekarang dah tak tegak dah rambut dia dah leper a'ah comel gila
I don't know I miss them cause dah lama tak jumpa
best dia makan semua benda especially fruits
dia basically kau suap apa pun dia buka mulut
and then kalau macam my sister duduk atas kerusi kan pastu dia kat bawah and she's like she's standing then my sister holding a fruit and then dia akan tries so hard untuk panjat my sister's legs
adoi tapi dia dah pandai lah main and then she doesn't like cats like you
she's scared of cats kalau kitaorang video call kan and then I'll be like meow meow then dia macam huh where's that coming from where's that coming from dia takut then sekali kitaorang nak kasi dia pegang kucing dia pegang dia peluk aku kuat kuat gila she's so scared
 semua ke
 bagus ah  macam gitu
 semua boys
ah  macam planning bar goal lah ni
 macam my cousin
four kids  juga so what happened was uh for them the first three
like just before university lah then  dorang pun happy happy kan yay dah  boleh semi retire
hurrah hurrah kan  mane kita nak pergi let's travel around the world
uh  macam gitu lah  kalau birthday  ni selalu we always tell people that you know ah really ah even when the adults celebrate the birthday kan frankly speaking alamak you know is really ah for the kids you know
it is really for them  pasal macam they really get into it you know  nanti kan uh  bila you tell them eh no need lah anything lah
coke anything also can but the kids are the ones that like oh must put this must put that oh must sing put the candle ah  semua ni kan all them ah
 ini topic eh I tell you eh I think every young adult ah will know this topic very well
kan kan  kita selalu gaduh kan
I think it's more frequent than that kan if only it was only every weekend you know  pasal every weekend kan is when you actually see tau
 kalau you  tak nampak in the week  pun kan  nanti dorang stealth tactic you know uh  behind your back ah eh  selit-selit kasi-kasi you know
ah and they will uh how shall I put this ah they don't even get defensive when you tell them eh how come ah when I was  kecik-kecik dulu tak pernah kasi pulak kena marah kena sebat
no kids uh but I was uh raising  itu my nephews my nieces kan from the time they were young lah um partly because for err me err usually lah I'm not around in singapore  pasal
I was studying away kan abroad then after that when I was working also um I was living abroad most of the time  pasal kena posting
so  selalunye not here so when I'm back usually
my  apa abang or adik already  duduk kat rumah lah  jaga
my  mak kan pasal my  apa parents my late father dengan my mak my mak masih ada lah tapi my father dah  arwah so I moved them into my place lah so when I'm home in singapore ah I jaga all my anak sedara lah
err  dulu mula-mula kerja dengan apa err foreign service
ah  jadi macam err
 lepas kerja sini tiga tahun lepas tu keluar empat tahun lepas tu come back home for about
you know couple of years and then after that you know when the big boss say eh you go ah ah then you go lah so to be honest lah I spent most of my uh youth away  pasal belajar kan you know away in university
then I come back  pun
out of the country the thing is  ye lah kan people always say eh but you come back what you know what's the big deal but I said ya but people usually travel I don't travel I live away
that ah that the big different lah  pasal most people kan  macam business especially you go in go out  keluar masuk lepas tu  ye lah  paling-paling maybe  seminggu you know
 semalam
 ini biasa lah
 tapi apart from  macam bonus  macam grade kan I mean  takde apa-apa macam incentive  ke or
uh is just to put ah  betul lah
ya actually ah your situation were quite similar to one of my good friend lah  pasal kita pergi sekolah sama-sama dulu-dulu kan one of my friend so he was
uh like you accountant also err so actually  yang hantar dia so went to  belajar lepas how many years ah three years ya three years  lepas tu balik lah  balik then of course serve the bond lah
serve the bond buat accounting kan and like you lah also quite good at it  dia punya bond  berapa eh  enam tahun masa tu
not too bad  pasal pun for them  dorang habiskan  dulu baru pergi unlike me lah  pasal for me kan disrupt uh
then ah then  pergi luar lepas tu ah  balik you see so
err  ye lah for
for me a bit different so  lepas tu my friend  balik as usual lah  kita kan
you know especially when  biasa lah kan  ada baby then baby shower
 lepas tu keep up  lepas tu kaya-kaya then  macam every  dua tiga bulan you know eh fed up lah let's go have  teh tarik adam road you know then one day out of the blue kan suddenly he said
you know I thought very good what no  ye lah but this is different I won't be going for posting what you know just stay office counting accounting accounting know to cut long story short  apa dia jadi nursing officer
ah  dekat hospital
until today ah  pulak sekarang COVID kan ah  pulak dia tan tock seng
ah wah high demand  bukan more in demand high demand  sekarang mengeluh aja lah so he saw already like alamak  kene shift work  lepas tu tengok sape foreign worker everyday kan
err I think that's just tip of the iceberg lah  pasal masa period gini kan  kena buat banyak lah I think the most important yang  dorang kena buat triage  macam
 semua bila datang tu kan ah  nanti is uh people like my friend and his team lah then they check and then they ask them eh you look familiar ah because after a while ah
they keep coming back  tahu because now they know what to do like oh my back pain uh  dapat oh I feeling
kan  pasal when you tell them ugh my chest ugh cannot breath sir ugh ugh ugh ah then you cannot take the risk kan
so my friend after a while wah  boleh kenal muka tahu
I mean that one for sure lah it must be twenty four hours  pasal you just never know when this virus will strike kan ah so  sebab itu susah eh for your job  yang last time  tu so you say you cover asia pac  selalunye which countries ah
ah see I'm older than you kan so  tahun sembilan puluh lima that's when I first started on the desk lah so I covered all fifty-four african countries
 pasal chad is spelt C H A D you know ah and then djibouti  pasal starts with a D D J
so I tell eh A to Z know you think what ah fifty-four country you know A to Z A to Z so ya travel there a lot because that one wasn't posting lah that one  macam
you know  dua minggu pergi so two weeks there you'll be like you in south africa
then after one month eh you go back there again then you go to you know um  macam namibia then you go to south africa then maybe you go switzerland
kan um  macam gitu ah but back then ah
ah you cannot stay too long lah  pasal
so from that time ah you know  sampai ke malam ah then even after you finish your dinner you might still meet up you know for a couple of short meetings and then you also still have to do your work kan
so ah it's fun ah especially when you're twenty something kan  penat pun penat lah of course but you know it's fun get to see the world ah by the way this is pre-laptop pre-handphone ah I'm different era
you must understand ah so much harder I mean  dulu
then uh you cannot find uh where you're going  mana ada Google map Google Earth  ni semua right so wah everyone  cakap eh
and I always tell people ya you all ah think now life so mafan ah  susah lah  ini lah  itu lah  leceh lah you know but imagine my time I told them started work ah no laptop is this thing called ah desktop
oh when they  itu ambil lah kan
nah I I've been uh using until today  cuma sekarang supplement uh  gunakan Netflix kan  gunakan you know Rakuten View
ah banyak lagi lah sometimes you wonder still worth it or not
two ah  macam macam dah  tak worth it  gitu lah kan  pulak kena bayar tiap-tiap bulan
 budak-budak semua masih suka Disney Plus eh
I went through that whole  apa uh how shall I put this ah I went through that whole cycle ah kan that whole cycle ah
twinx the magical fairy  ini semua kan that that was I went through the whole cycle
kan then you have to be always referee kan  nanti uh  yang satu nak tengok ini nak tengok powerband  lepas tu adiknya abang I want to watch something else  abang ah then you have to be referee kan then when the cousin  semua datang ha  lagi lah kalang kabut
on uh handphone or tablet or whatever you see ya I bucked the trend long ago I always tell them kalau nak tengok semua share okay
ah  macam Panadol you know
I think fair enough everyone has their own parenting style but I think you are absolutely right  macam mana pun kan I mean cannot lah you know when ipad first started kan I realised a lot of people buy stroller
then there's that little hook that you can put kan  dorang taruk situ then babies are watching it you know I started seeing that very quickly you see so
 macam kenapa lah you know maybe lah you call me jurassic eh  pasal I'm conservative about this thing kan  macam huh why is your baby looking at Youtube lah and this and that kan to me if your baby's crying number one is actually good for baby to cry  pasal dia punya lung
get exercise  tahu
 cuma you don't want them to cry for of course one whole hour then something is definitely wrong go see doctor lah you know but otherwise baby cry pickup usually they will stop crying  pasal babies are
father of four kan you  tahu lah kan  budak-budak ni semua  bila nangis then you  kasi attention  sikit aja semua okay
exactly exactly ah  sama lah
no  pasal you  pun sekarang tengok nanti bila family  keluar kan
you are here to it as family so each one of you are too busy with your Instagram your work mail your Whatsapp so what's the point ah oh my friends  semua marah if I
say things like that you know ah  kena tegur sikit je semua melenting so  macam no lah you don't understand so I will said so what is it that I don't understand I live on the same planet way I have the same family structures what
kenapa I don't tak faham apa-apa you know say you know I don't understand you know these kids ah
said  biasa lah
eh let's face it lah you know even we as teenagers ah last time kan remember when your mother  tanya score  macam mana ah okay lah
lost your homework  kena marah teacher don't know where was your wallet your friend
ah tease out kan bit by bit and find out  semua kan all these kinds of things lah
no I think until you basically die I always remind people  pun kan you know let's face it you know even when you become a parent right your own parents can be eighty plus and you are maybe sixty plus right to them ah you are still ah
people over and over again lah kan  pasal so is true what is twenty-four hour you cannot switch off  macam even  lepas I  hantar last time lah eh my  anak sedara and all that to their school whether it's kindergarten primary school whatever then I go to work
although  ada maid ada  dia punya you know grandmother  kat rumah kan
but I don't think it's it's just you I think uh there are still a small but good number of people yang macam you and that's good  tahu pasal
would to be honest I was teaching for about  setahun gitu for one
you know take some time talk to them kan  tanya-tanya macam mana kan then you realize actually they are quite neglected
mm  tapi kesian juga you know and you can see it you know  macam quite a number of them
seek attention so they they really many of them  macam manja-manja dengan teacher  pasal macam
dah lah  every day pergi sekolah kan and even during COVID and home based learning kan they see the teacher still online kan  pasal
but I can tell you also when we went into phase two kan wah  budak-budak semua balik sekolah kan
no more home based learning for many schools kan wah most parents hurrah hurrah  pasal they can still work from home but the kids must go out wah
 betul kan
 ni macam shift work kan follow the time zone so tell the kids okay ah  tidur eh
ah  betul
or you can travel a bit lah take one day off to maybe  beli-beli barang boleh beli present kan
mm  beli present kan ah
especially if nearer to the school holiday  ke kan
 musim apa musim sejuk
you're lucky if is brown lah  selalunye kan is more like like greyish black  tahu
and then the other thing is I call it slushy  pasal is really that  macam yang that seven eleven  punya slushy you know the Slurpee ah kan  pasal it's
ah the colour of course Slurpee  lebih sedap lah you know
when you walk around kita kan  tak biasa pakai waterproof boots and this and that
and that's the thing I I don't like about that lah  tapi london during that period also nice lah  pasal christmas ah
wah  pergi london bridge
 empat-empat
 kenapa tak pergi itu euro Disney
wah ni mesti makan chocolate ah
 ni nak tengok that little statue of that little boy peeing lah kan
 tengok bola lah wah
correct  sebelum Grab lah mm
ah  itu lah
 tapi dapat tangkap glamour ah
 dia bayar itu lah family ah
your  kawan jadi super sub ah
ah kan  ada
for me last time I would go to manchester  macam a few couple of months I go up  pasal I was studying kan that time
oh  lepas tu nanti one of
not one ah couple of my friends  semua gila bola juga
then  dorang ada that time uh subscription ah
 macam membership you know so but the good thing is being asian  dorang semua mana macam muka kita
so we go and we go  bukan uh division one  aja we don't just go to premier league you know we also look for  yang macam
 pasal takde big name  takde big player they weren't having all those kind of you know hundred million pound transfer you know that kind of thing
mm mm mm I was posted to paris  tapi from paris I also cover uh three other countries lah I'm based in paris but I also cover spain portugal and another country so  empat
country lah  yang kena jaga so for me ah when people come usual lah you know then they'll want to go to euro Disney and then don't forget ah I was also surprised your wife didn't drag you to the
ah  pasal
and  kalau pergi london  tu just outside  selalu ni all this uh
housewives all these  makcik-makcik will want to buy the Wedgwood
ah  dorang bukan beli satu dua orang lain semua order pasal dorang ship tahu
singapore I mean wherever you are in the world lah so wah shiok you know so I was in paris uh two zero four to eight so  empat tahun ah  kat situ
 nanti nampak yang that  lampu tu lah kan  dia macam lighthouse kan every night ah ah so I'll see that light lah
eh  penat juga budak-budak
 naik stroller lah two of them
actually gare du nord when you  keluar pun makanan sedap pasal banyak
halal  banyak kebab  banyak yang maghrebian  nya kan  yang daripada morocco  daripada daripada mana eh uh
ah  ada dua option satu you just  naik yang lagi satu boleh makan
really a shock to to many people when notre dame burned down  pasal that thing has been around for so long
and it's  macam symbol lah paris kan so  bila
 bukan sabotage  bukan ada terrorism
 sedih juga pasal orang kalau naik boat boat  ni semua dorang touring kan it's really really
ya and I do miss uh living there  pasal it's really one of the most beautiful cities in the world lah you know without a doubt lah you know
paris eh  memang really made for walking even compare to london you know london  macam K lah you can walk a bit a bit lah  tapi after a while  macam
ah boring you lose your way and then is quite dirty also you know in london you know and  macam after awhile there's no change in the scenery kan
 kena tengok bawah lah  pasal dorang banyak apa itu taik anjing semua ni kan
they got lah  nanti after COVID
after COVID even for me  pun frankly lah eh  lepas I came back two thousand eight
after that I rarely go out anymore lah  pasal pun tukar kerja then
basically mostly  dekat singapore lah
 tak tak keluar-keluar and it's by choice lah  pasal
you know is also question of family and a question of you know looking after people especially my  mak kan seventy seven this year and ya so she still lives with me I don't live with her she lives with me there's a big difference
and also then for me travel just means basically usually weekend ah  masuk johor lah
mm and also  pun aiya you know  boleh beli barang-barang lebih murah you know and many
things are easy you know and even when you've got kids kan like I've got even uh grand nephews grand nieces kan  yang dekat malaysia then its easy to uh go to
Legoland kan  pergi makan-makan
only be able to travel kan pergi johor and whatever  sebelum kita boleh really go out there again lah
know  dekat-dekat lah you know maybe
likewise also we need them for workers you know um  pasal every day before COVID kan between two hundred to three hundred thousand eh  dua ratus tiga ratus ribu tahu kan  bukannye satu dua ribu kan
you know we need each other and but you're definitely right  pasal apa dia punya
 penjaja all the businesses it's very hard for them without us you see
obviously lah but also don't forget catered also for the johorians who work here  pasal
as soon as you hire one kan then  dorang buka kan payroll payroll  nye tu ah so  dorang gunakan apa dorang gunakan Nets
ah  dia by two kan when you go there  sekarang some shops lah they definitely accept Nets which is good lah you know
 pasal even for their workers kan  lepas tu balik malaysia lah  nak kena pakai ringgit pulak up kan nak tukar duit
kan when their salary is already in sing dollars so  dorang alah pakai Nets aje lah  lebih senang
 tak susah
but you can tell ah  macam the shopping mall over there you know you can go onto all those sites kan  yang nanti orang ambil gambar ambil Youtube ghost town  betul lah
is really bad  macam city square tu kan
um  orang semua tengok wah really really ghost town you really really wonder how they are going to survive
ya hopefully lah it'll be a slow and painful process lah but you know everyone is going through the same thing so it's not  macam kita aje kan you know
is everyone everyone is going through the same thing so  macam gitu aje lah
ah that's always good question  tahu pasal macam orang selalu cakap you know to me  macam each one is so different kan so
you know ya  pasal dulu pun when I was a student then you know lah budget pun  bukannye banyak kan even though you know you got sponsorship and this and that so we are the type  macam
you know you just  ambil gambar ambil gambar
and that's it you know  macam you  tak appreciate the country you don't really appreciate the culture you  tak duduk bersimbang-simbang you know have the equivalent of  teh tarik with a local you see
but as a working adult that's what I did lah you know just to go round and then lose myself in the crowd  lepas tu berbual-berbual with the local or foreigners who live there you just make friends kan ah so for me that's where it's quite you know
but I must say um not so much now lah but in the early days then hanoi was really good destination for me  pasal that was my first posting I lived there for four years ninety-seven to two thousand and one
and that was the earliest  yang dorang  baru jer  buka kan err
 orang asing you know so was a lot of fun lah you know and then after that even after I left I made it a point maybe every three years to come back visit old friends
orang melayu ah or like someone who belajar melayu
you rasa
to improve dorang punya
yes belum keluar
oh kat yang bedok is it tanah merah
apa tu err
and I got like three days off you know how I told you macam I
sepuluh hari lagi left
slowly slowly ah slowly gila
ya but they didn't look at more on strengths uh they didn't even ask anything about the weaknesses so I think a bit macam
ah macam gitu lah ya
but apa tu
the apa tu the
kurang ajar seh kurang ajar gila
it's not it's tak compulsory tapi macam
eh asal you tak baca dulu sebelum you buat paper
okay I think that was me in in apa tu in
secondary school also when kita buat lit
okay jap
speedy ni
speedy tak tahu lah
dia tak nak berbual dengan kita pastu selalu gini tau like everytime dia
everytime kita nak everytime I want to talk to him right then he always run away but then when we don't need him around he's always ya he's always around like what the hell
okay lah okay lah tak cukup attention
tak cukup apa tak cukup attention kesian dia
but apa tu
so dia baru join
because there was this other person but he selalu
ya it was quite rabak uh
err apa tu err
ya lah abeh nak mandi semua
so anyway he told me that lah he told me macam
so macam he was damn lost ah
my language classes then dia macam
dia macam tak cakap apa-apa never say anything so aku macam okay
ya so it's a bit macam give me some heads up uh
tu lah
like ya I cannot force people like I cannot paksa orang to
datang and you know
and then macam it makes more sense for me to follow other people's schedule but like
I have to really plan macam straight away after finish
pastu keluar lepak and then go straight to work atau sleep a bit more and
tidur jer kerja
ya and because my shift pukul berapa pukul tiga
no takde takde takde
no they dorang big fans of macam the workflow and all that even though it's a bit more chill uh actually
tu lah maksud dia
ya around different workflows different deliverables everything ah because it's a totally lain punya client ya
ya she she took chemistry in the pastu um
that I've been very complacent macam I've
not complacent macam terlalu banyak
err oh yang ni jangan nak kena betul-betul tengok the the deadline and all that
abeh kita proofreading we put everything ah like whether the date is correct
the numbering and all that and the oh categorisation and all that is betul
macam whether they
whether they apa tu
volunteer because kita punya kerja kan banyak ada nak kena chope
macam you must chope certain deliverables lah
correct so like every morning okay I tell you the process of macam mana kita kerja
okay so pukul tiga setengah I bangun
let's say pukul lima we have to send headlines
because I'm the kind of person yang I cannot tunggu for people
like I'm not a apa tu
that was last time uh remember I told you there was like one time in between july sampai
september ke august
just jaded like macam
so dorang macam lepas tangan cepat-cepat
orang ketiga lah
apa benda home wrecker
no I think dorang nak more natural conversation so that
I know lah but macam we are talking directly to you know now we have to like just have a conversation between ourselves so that you know in the future we are actually helping
I don't know takut it's not because I don't they also never say like what
kesian seh
ya what have you been watching lately cerita
good tak it looks like very old

ya macam
then macam
I don't know lah there could be those directors yang very macam oh I need this shot
I need this shot it needs to be this particular way you know macam
ya what what kind of movie would you film melayu
would it be more macam
embodies that the most yang paling
paling like paling dekat show that the kind of movie that you like
okay more prominent ones yang kita tengok Handmaiden tu was it good
mm macam the food change eh food chain
wah takde movies what movies is
you know what I mean like you it makes you think macam oh my god whoa
but like you know when he went through the apa tu
kan ada I don't know whether the lady or the man yang cakap
if dia go through the door
did we watch another movie together about the the cerita indonesia
yang ugh was I with you
it was this cerita pasal
who had to balik to balik kampung sebab
dia nak reconnect dengan family dia ke apa
ke oh dia nak dia nak cari
remember yang dia hang baju pastu
cerita apa eh
yes yes yes that one yang tu yang tu
will you do it on your own or will you like go out to like uh tanya or ask anyone I don't know
but this kind of thing definitely need macam to set up to set aside like at least
oh yes you're right you're right betul betul betul
betul betuls okay lah
cute gila oh my god it's very cute
ya ya I dah wash lagi I dah basuh
I dah kering

bawa balik ah mana satu yang you nak
because it all looks so pretty semua lawa gila
dia macam those who know will know right
and then people think like err this girl anyhow only does she even know the movie dia tahu ke tak tahu ni dia main pakai jer
ya we've talked about this before berbual
like you know how when it when it's macam when it's very a niche group of people watching a niche show right it makes the show more special
dia macam it feels a bit cheaper because like
oh now they are going more mainstream lebih mainstream
popularity of macam demon slayer for example
not as popular of course lah but macam ya so like
it's easier for me to buy merch let's say merchandise nak beli nak beli apa lagi
ya macam these merchandise nak beli baju you know
ya lah but macam if you if it were another show for example macam Fruits Basket
atau I don't know what's another show I don't hear it err hunter by hunter X hunter
quite popular eh macam you know what I mean
well known so macam that's why I say there's pros and cons ah
you tahu kan I ada classmate jepun in my korean class
so dia
so macam most of us kita ambil sebab kita either
kita tengok cerita K drama dengar lagu K-pop or like you know just korean artist
so I asked her like oh how about ya so I asked her macam
and she say macam
macam real people
the life in japan macam how was her school life or like at least lah
she's quite nice lah then she shared with me like about her school life uh how dia kerja part time
quite interesting ah it's it's I love this class because macam
and like the eleven year old punya remember I berbual pasal
cute gila
ya because like I like I talk to her about macam my trip to yogyakarta the like last year
and then she would share with me about her time also macam in jakarta and how dia rindu lah rindu gila dengan jakarta tapi she she feels like
she will definitely stay in singapore for a bit because this place paling
tak kat yishun not at yishun
and then um dia macam I don't know
korean like I can ask where the toilet is I can ask how much and understand how much a certain item is I just it'll take me awhile to um calculate lah because dorang punya numbering is very susah gila it's like
dorang count kan dorang punya currency besar gila kan
correct hyperinflation like of indonesia sama juga
so nak kena you must really calculate lah
banyak fikir ah I feel like it's easier for me to write then it is for me to speak which is not a good thing because you're supposed to be able to speak better because you're learning a language
exactly but macam
ya I just have to keep practising but I have no one to practise with at work also no one wants to layan my korean I feel like I'm such a
lawa gila it's very it's super damn it's super nice
hello hi how are you I nak minta tolong sikit lah boleh tak
tu lah my parents nak makan nasi padang ah but I don't know where can you
recommend I don't know where is the best nasi padang in singapore I mean I know the the usual ones they have they always like to go to their favourite is like hajjah maimunah you know but other than that cause hajjah maimunah I went went there just now today they're not open
mm tak kisah lah
I think I think I know I think I know yang mana satu we ever seen that place before but don't think I've tried sana sedap eh
oh is that type lah I mean you have to queue and buy you don't have no need to make reservation all that kena eh tak payah eh
oh sebelas this is for lunch lah
ya nasi padang I think the most of the places jarang ah eh I think but there's one place I don't know you pernah pergi ke tak dekat-dekat sana juga apa eh nama dia I think it's called sari ratu you pernah pergi sana buka I think like pukul sembilan malam pun dia masih buka tau
I actually have no idea but I pernah pergi makan sana pukul sembilan malam gitu
dia punya lauk masih still looks fresh lah tak tak rasa macam
since pagi ke apa maybe dia orang masak petang juga but okay lah kalau in case you keluar dengan your family or your friends
tekak you nak makan nasi padang you don't know where to go ya it's it's I think they have a few other outlets but the one I went to was I forgot the name of the road lah but it's it's quite near the kampong glam area like baghdad street or something like that
oh apa nama tempat dia eh
ya I think the the mall itself is a expensive mall kalau pergi sana I think
okay lah I think I will try that that what minang place there
ya then that's the plan think I'm bringing err my parents dia orang nak makan sana cause just nice lah think after that I boleh ke nak jalan around the area beli kain-kain ke apa-apa
that that area got a lot of kedai-kedai macam gitu kan jual kain lah jual buku-buku lah jual baju lah carpet lah
tak tahu eh belum ada plan but around that area got a few malls kan
for the house I don't know like pinggan mangkuk ke apa think whatever ya lah
dia orang nak beli I think nak beli macam periuk-periuk tempat masak I think can bring to think bugis junction quite near
ya lah I think everywhere lah the same but now if possible duduk rumah more ya cause if you have to go out also yang no choice then kalau nak keluar you buy whatever you need to buy you beli dah beli dah makan ke apa then terus balik then kalau you nak merayap pergi mana-mana sekarang makin
code sometimes you take the code also still need to queue nak kena tunggu and go there go to the shop for less than five minutes
true I think now banyak orang buat gitu lah tapi kadang-kadang barang macam baju ke apa you nak beli kadang-kadang you beli online you tengok colour ni
nanti datang colour lain
kita kita boleh hantar balik kan dia orang boleh
tak boleh refund ke
wah ya lah and gambar you tak boleh cannot
trust kadang-kadang
then in the end what happened did you makan the nasi jer
I think I think got banyak lah I dengar complain for me that time I order but I didn't I didn't I didn't order for delivery I think I order for sometimes you can order
untuk self pick up you know you order then you pergi sana sendiri you you you
you pick up the food sendiri then I order at first they say the food should be ready dua puluh minit then I dah sampai sana I tunggu almost one hour baru the food siap
that one lagi self pick up kalau I tunggu dia delivery I think mungkin more than one hour but this was back then lah during the time time circuit circuit breaker
think nobody nobody nobody can say they never order grab during that time I think semua orang order
pernah order grab takkan hari-hari masak kat rumah kan
tu lah nak makan kat luar kedai pun tutup then bila order tunggu satu jam ya lah that time I I ada satu friend pun dia ceritakan dia order I think err mothers' day I think
ah dia order pun dia order err
dia dah order tunggu lama-lama the punya app cakap waiting for driver nak dekat dua puluh minute in the end tak ada dia dah order order order tunggu tunggu tunggu dia cakap cancel dah tunggu twenty minutes uh huh
day ada orang dah advance order the day before to arrive for example eh dia cakap you order for today esok dia suruh deliver for makan tengah hari
pukul dua belas ah on the next day lah they advance order lah then when it comes on the day half an hour before dia orang cancel dia punya order
orang orang nak buat celebration dia orang buat macam gini tu lah
ya lah but the the the the grab driver sometimes it's not their fault lah it's all the the the the restaurants kadang-kadang dia orang pergi sana then restaurant yang cakap cancel but dia orang tak fair lah then the driver the rider kena marah
I think maybe for safety juga lah I think kalau satu not not dia orang punya tanggungjawab kalau dia orang pergi check and then the the let's say the deliver deliver lepas tu orang tu cakap eh dalam eh inside my my packet got
for example lah dia cakap I see hair then they complain kat restaurant nanti restaurant will cakap eh but the rider just now got check your food so maybe the hair come from them
I think the restaurant dia orang lah pasal dia orang yang pack makanan so they have to make sure everything is there cause the delivery the grab delivery guy kerja dia is just to send so kalau
ya ya lah you can see tengok kadang-kadang dia orang hujan ke panas pun dia orang dia orang still delivering
ya but what to do ya but I think got one time I heard err I got one friend kawan I satu err whenever dia order
kasih dia orang tip kasih cash ya lah but sometimes a'ah dia kasih extra like maybe two dollar ke lima dollar
I tak tahu lah I think so but I think maybe
maybe dia orang order often so maybe once in a while they order then ya lah but good lah then these people they they they don't ask they don't earn a lot what kalau dapat tip and not say
kerja dia orang senang ya lah senang as in cuma ambil makanan hantar makanan tapi kadang-kadang nak kena layan yang customer complain lah customer marah so I think once in a while ada orang
kasih tip macam gitu
kasih dorang macam motivate dia orang lah at least ada juga orang yang
baik hati kalau tak asyik kena marah jer
tu lah cakap cakap pasal gitu kalau nasi padang dia orang ada deliver kan bagus eh tapi I cari semua tak ada
tapi nasi ambeng ada deliver tapi nasi padang I think tak ada
kesian lah
dia tak ada offered to refund ke apa-apa that's not good actually
cannot lah the customer dia orang bayar apa
so nanti esok you nak ikut tak I nak pergi cycling mm
I think kita dah quite long time kita tak pergi changi beach lah
takpe lah we go kita pergi early lah morning you know I mean by by tengah hari we should be done then can can go back
for lunch ya lah this quite some time I pun dah lama tak tak ride my bicycle
you punya bicycle masih ada tak then okay lah is it the same one that you beli dulu
cause recently I think that day I I I ada beli I went to the bicycle shop lah to change to buy new helmet cause my helmet dah dah koyak dia punya strap I was talking to the owner of the shop dia cakap sekarang like everyday dia jual like maybe
I think so cause that time dia orang tak boleh
wherever lah tak boleh pergi makan luar tak boleh pergi tengok wayang lah tak boleh pergi shopping lah
I think dia baru baru buka lah aiya maybe I don't know tak tahu eh
maybe lah I think they they the the new movies I think maybe kalau rasa
you rasa kalau dia orang keluar pun sekarang mungkin tak siapa yang nak pergi
tengok maybe they wait lah they wait until maybe the the cinema allow
ya there's no apa
esok esok kita pergi to changi after that after that kita pergi makan nasi lemak nak mm
okay kita pergi the famous one lah kat sana yang changi
I think the I don't know I think maybe the sambal lah okay the rest of the outlet should be the same
esok kita boleh try lah kalau kalau kalau makcik
beli I senyum kalau pakcik then you senyum okay think just nice lah so we go cycling then go nasi lemak ya then after that we head back
tu dah macam yang kat bangkok kadang-kadang boleh panas
abeh orang boleh pengsan gitu ya
I think dia punya macam
ya lah I think dia punya mungkin usually like that dia punya dia punya what you call that dia punya longkang ah dia punya drainage sumbat of course lah then kalau dia punya rain was like that day
pagi sampai petang what six seven hours ya lah
if the rain that much then the drain sumbat mana air nak pergi
ya lah tu nanti kalau dia orang ada rumah yang those landed property
okay lah but this kind of weather I think susah nak predict kalau you tengok panas kadang-kadang pagi hujan or the other way that day pagi hujan lebat then dia stop
I think dia orang also just tikam jer lah
maybe it's the other side maybe you kat east side tampines maybe kat choa chu kang ke jurong yang hujan right mm kadang-kadang like like that what not the whole singapore
uh oh kesiannya then
mm mm that means ya lah lama lah
I think most of the the what you call it apa dia panggil dengue hot spot eh dah banyak dulu I think tak banyak tempat I think near my place also kat pasir ris ada there there there's err
one case opposite my block mm ya but sometimes when you hear this kind of thing then you you you worry what so that time when when my my mum dengar then terus dia pergi luar dia check dia punya pasu-pasu bunga make sure tak ada because kalau the officers datang
they can summon you kan I think ya so kalau you have like tak lah
I tak tahu I think they come random lah it's either that or either that or I don't know eh mungkin kalau ada neighbour yang complain tak tahu kalau the neighbours suspect you you tak
maybe lah maybe dia orang they they take I think I'm just guessing maybe dia orang take like a a sample
of the water something like dia orang bawa
dia orang punya lab agaknya dia orang check I don't know cause if not
they they won't see what I think need like at least like a magnifying glass or like a microscope so maybe they bring back lah they take some sample of the air bawa balik to lab then run dia orang test agaknya lah but ya lah sometimes they will check what even if they cannot see kalau dia orang tengok let's say rumah you
ada ada plants ada potted plants then dia punya air dia tengok eh macam tak tukar they will tanya apa nanti dia orang tanya dia punya air do you change everyday because by right you kena tukar so at least if
happen to be the nyamuk bertelur kat situ kalau you tukar hari-hari
then dapat dapat
but you you get to buang dia punya telur apa ah kalau let's say you
tak tukar I pun tak tahu I pernah baca I don't know lah maybe takes a few days lah maybe like four to five days for the whole process for the nyamuk
telur to tukar lah so kalau you leave it for that long then maybe you might kena summon lah kalau dia check so that time my my mum dengar dia terus check
ya lah kat rumah pun semua tukar at least everyday lah
ya lah so kita
kalau ya lah because the the like what's the
the way cause I read on online the way to differentiate they say this mosquito dia punya kaki tu ada ada belang-belang ada belang-belang
tu lah
kalau you kena gigit pun mm
so I think if you if you rasa macam you kena gigit dengan mosquito I think you just
or you just monitor lor dia punya mosquito is not the aedes mosquito you you won't have fever what if after you get bitten then dua tiga hari lepas tu you demam I think better go doctor you check
ah tak ada dia
mm then that one can can can lead to complications lah kalau tak kalau biasa punya after some time it will it will get better ya lah but leceh lah you know means you you if you get bitten by the aedes mosquito then you kena dengue
then you cannot see what kalau dia nak gigit you dia pun tak tak warning
the the numbers just recently I think I think india in one day dia punya the number of cases for COVID lah was like six almost sixty thousand just one day
these countries I guess because dia orang punya
ya then some of them might not be even kat hospital you know
ya ya lah because the that time when they they they were checking on the dormitories I think all the foreign workers tak boleh kerja kan
semua orang first time pun tak tahu ya but
foreign workers was was told to quarantine eh quarantine themselves duduk kat dalam dormitory tu kalau I tak tahu rumah you you tengok rumput-rumput pun tak ada orang potong macam dah macam hutan kat my office pun sama dia punya
dah tak terjaga ya lah that shows
the foreign workers are important only time time macam gini then people realise oh ya ya lah this during this difficult
period you boleh tengok macam orang yang what you call that essential essential workers you can tell like macam those tadi kita complain pasal grab food driver and all that ya kalau you imagine kalau dia orang tak ada that time circuit breaker you nak makan macam mana
we wait for the food one hour it might be even worse without them maybe you order morning your lunch baru dapat
and all these foreign workers now then you notice that without them nobody bersihkan know your around your area under your block all that
ya lah but tempat your workplace how you still going to work or
when that day I think I was at the area lah raffles down there lah you can see I was there lunch time macam tak ada orang mm can see that there is definitely different lah you see the lunch time crowd macam more like a ghost town I would say
including my my tempat kerja pun I think in ya I think in future maybe this is what I I I I guess would happen lah sooner or later most offices also would wouldn't be might be might be smaller you know
cause you realise that most of the employees also don't need to be in office cause sekarang dah berapa tiga eh dah tiga since march dah lima bulan dah
working from home still masih survive apa so why do they need to like rent office mahal-mahal duduk kat rumah pun tetap business jalan
kalau you kat rumah pun at least you save transport right if ya lah our train here not expensive but if you talk about one month how much maybe
maybe the only thing yang you spend more I rasa mungkin is just your utilities lor
kan bila at home
if not usually you are at home malam-malam and weekend but now it's like twenty four seven hari-hari
because bila dulu time sebelum all these terjadi orang semua nak keluar so sekarang dah gini semua takut semua nak duduk rumah
ya betul
iya lah mana dia orang nak pergi
airline pun even the airline nak pergi pun the the the I think the government doesn't allow
kat singapore if you boring also I think singapore even though kecil still got a lot of places if you want to explore
give them more things to do if all the businesses tak buat macam gini orang boleh jadi gila tak ada benda nak buat
takkan nak tengok jer eh but everything
ya I think like hari-hari dia orang boleh tengok semua habis nak buat apa
ya kalau tak it's not like kita
we said what the wayang orang nak tengok wayang pun the cinemas belum buka so
a lot of shows right like if if if they have those new macam wayang I mean filem-filem yang baru mungkin more people will will go kalau tak ada orang not interested ya lah at least they have entertainment at home or more
your ya but I think no choice lah sekarang semua kena gitu
ya like dulu pun macam apa tu during bulan puasa orang nak bayar what you call that the zakat fitrah ya but now also everything online what dulu people would queue at the
masjid you know mm even
the yang baru lepas hari raya haji korban also not allowed then some people just do overseas then they will just maybe take video or whatever then send all all consider now digital human no more face to face
ya I think all the woodlands jurong I think they were I forgot I think tak salah I ada sepuluh ya ten different places where they have the celebration lah ya
ya kalau dia orang buat dekat the same place then more people will go there what so I think they have to lah to to elakkan orang go to like the padang or marina marina floating platform all that so
they just do at their own neighborhood so people tak akan you know berkumpul at the tempat which is better lah everything lah like err I think in other countries also you the this year I think the olympics are suppose to happen
ya lah cannot lah some more lagi that kind of event I think you're talking about
saw got people post gambar-gambar yang the river singapore river lah the some of the beaches the sea looks
nobody driving around ya their air cleared so tak ada macam berasap-asap lagi and then kita kat sini I mean we don't experience that that lah but for me personally I tengok bila during circuit breaker tak banyak kereta you can see like you said bila kita pergi jogging kat luar ke apa macam
lagi fresh dia punya air tak macam dulu tak bau asap kereta right ya so I think ya everybody complain complain complain there is good also lah that come out of this people realise like you say just now people don't need to shop a lot
apa yang yang I nak cakap you tak payah spend so much you know to to actually to to enjoy yourself to keep yourself happy ya just do the simple things
some friends also they start you know some some of them do business lah like they bake and then sell some of them for themselves lah but at least it gives you time to to to learn something new you so you ada whatever lah
hobby baru ke apa ada yang masak ada yang boleh tak tahu lah eh
main gitar bernyanyi lah
ya kalau if this thing didn't happen you you'd takkan tahu yang all this thing you boleh buat so actually sometimes instead of complaining you can just look the other side lah or what
kita complain complain hari-hari pagi petang malam pun you complain also the thing will still remain then takkan today you complain then tomorrow you do the same thing
true ya but I guess people are just people dah memang lumrah orang manusia ni kalau tak complain dia tak puas dia mesti ada benda nak cakap right
macam ni lah government government kasih duit orang complain government tak kasih duit pun orang complain
betul kita cakap orang pun I think kadang-kadang I pun complain juga
sometimes you say it's bad but then if people say otherwise it's good you nak kena tengok you tak boleh degil you know nak dengar cakap you jer
complain but at the end of the day I think especially kita kat sini kat singapore I think kita still not as bad as you compare to other countries
you can't even I mean you can maybe you boleh pergi beli pasar mungkin you boleh beli
beras all those barang dapur tapi dia kasih pergi mungkin
satu minggu sekali but still singapore I think
itu pun ada orang kan that time berapa a lot of people masuk facebook masuk stomp tak nak pakai then kena kena all the officers suruh dia orang pakai pun dia cari pasal
ya by right bukan susah benda tu nak ya lah macam like
I see them tu lah that time
government kasih free leh nak minta dia orang pakai
I mean there's a there's a there's a feeling lah rasa macam
kaya apa dia orang ya lah
kan tapi dia blonde
ini bukan yang ni both fiction

ah kau masih ada kan so aku akan buat macam ni lah tapi bila kau dah takde aku terpaksa cari plan B kan takkan aku macam gitu kan kalau tak ada apa-apa betul tak
mungkin waktu rehat aku lah lunch aku satu jam tutup mata no choice ah jadi jadi aku perhatikan kau tahu pasal aku rasa hidup aku ni macam kosong
kosong sebab kau tidak takde seorang wanita yang boleh memberikan aku kekuatan macam kau tahu macam partnership macam mana
aku terus cakap dengan kau lah eh
tadi kalau kau pernah pergi kat one north kan kau akan terlihat seorang perempuan gempal tau kau pernah nampak tak
siapa eh mesti kau pernah nampak dia kirakan uh yang temperature screener dekat sebelah one north security kan
iya lah kat luar station tu lah so sekali hari aku dah pernah jumpa dia tapi dia ni pula kelakar ah cakap dari sini eh dia masih bersuami
ada anak dua tinggal dengan suami tapi dia ada matair lain kat luar matair dia pula dalam case kau faham jadi aku nak kenal-kenal dengan dia pun macam mana ni
suami lain matair lain abeh aku ni siapa ah cina buta jadi aku cakap ah tak payah lah aku korbankan sensasi bontot dia kan aku korbankan aku punya niat
aku tak nak teruskan tapi aku nak tegur dia dia takda aku rasa dia dah tak tahu entah resign ke apa tapi budaknya baik abeh aku rasa umur dia tiga puluh dua tahun
K kita punya segment macam segment segment apa segment rumah tangga pula eh kau ni jauh-jauh seh dari kau punya line
jadi sekali hari tu aku balik naik sampai ke choa chu kang lot one K hujan lebat aku ikut dia babe dari jauh sebab aku kirakan macam dah buang tebiat kan jadi
pada ketika tu aku nampak dia bawa barang banyak tau lepas tu dia belanja tu bulan puasa babe bulan puasa recently
dia nak balik dari dia punya lot one nak naik bus kan lepas tu aku nak ikut dia sekali aku aku tak dapat cari dia punya jejak lah dia hilang tanpa jejak
kemudian hilang jejak dia pun um the next day aku jumpa lagi aku ikut lagi ah this time aku beranikan diri aku approach dia tak silap aku that time oh okay
aku approach dia aku tanya nombor telefon dia ketika dia tengah temperature screening so aku rasa a few days later berapa hari yang lalu
the next day aku jumpa dia ah aku minta tanya dia lah nombor telefon dia lah eh
dia perasan aku bilang dia aku bilang apa yang terjadi lah aku bilang dia saya ikut awak gini gini beberapa hari yang lalu dia bodoh bodoh ingat aku ni macam psycho takde lah niat saya nak kawan-kawan jer takde apa-apa
so lepas tu aku tak kenal sangat pasal dia kita pun jumpa ah ajak keluar makan ah
keluar makan pastamania itu kira bila bulan puasa lah jadi aku tengok dia
so far okay ah tinggal dekat choa chu kang anak dua tapi dia kasih tahu aku status dia ah
so suami dia kirakan okay lah cakap cakap kira cakap pendek kirakan
bawa perempuan tu datang rumah kat atas katil dia kan dua dua terancang lah dia dapat tangkap she came back jadi
dia benar-benar rasa marah kan so aku tak tahu apa terjadi
tapi dia kata demi untuk anak-anak dia masih simpan perkahwinan dia tapi pada masa yang sama dia jumpa satu abang grab ni lah dia naik grab kan dia jumpa satu abang bawa grab ni kan abang tu pula pun kat dalam case nak ceraikan bini dia
jadi masing-masing mungkin dalam situasi yang sama jadi masing-masing pun kantoi mungkin uh masing-masing berpacaran ah for the past like seven eight months sebelum aku nak masuk dalam picture
tapi kalau aku kaji kembali aku lihat eh
aku rasa tak boleh kan sebab apa ni uh complicated kan betul tak
kalau aku nak jumpa dia sekali pun nanti aku pun rasa tak sedap eh kalau aku kalau aku ajak dia keluar ajak makan mungkin aku belikan dia barang ke apa ah kau rasa sesuai ke dia dia masih bekas bini orang
abeh lepas satu matair orang aku ni siapa cinta buta takkan tiga orang dengan satu takkan nak takkan nak gang bang pula tak boleh babe takkan tiga dengan satu boleh gang bang
tak boleh jadi aku rasa macam alamak tak kisah lah kasih dia lepas ah betul tak
aku dah stop jadi apa yang aku buat aku punya cara simple aku delete aku hilangkan padamkan nombor telefon beliau aku hilangkan aku ah buang segala
record record ataupun ah history eh
aku punya message message conversation dan juga eh so that's it so aku tak payah apa-apa ingat ingat lagi
so lepas tu dia pun tak message aku aku pun tak message dia jadi kita pun buat macam takde macam buat bodoh lah faham
aku dah lama tak contact dia jadi dah dekat dalam dua satu minggu lebih dua minggu jadi aku ingat dia masih kat sana tapi ni hari tak nampak
mungkin dia dah pergi tempat lain mungkin dah resign tau tapi kerja dia ni macam ada contract kau tahu macam dia datang kerja dia tu
five and a half days kan ambil temperature sahaja kau faham tapi aku bilang sama dia awak kenapa tak nak cari macam kerja permanent macam cari kerja kau faham macam admin kan so dia bilang aku dia nak ambil security course
aku bilang dia security course aku bilang dia lah dua belas jam tau you awak nak ambil security awak punya anak-anak macam mana aku bilang dia lah kan saya rasa lebih baik awak fikir dua tiga kali lah saya bilang sebab kalau awak kirakan awak dia suka buat event
ah so dia suka macam jual-jual barang kau tahu macam flea market dia suka macam organise tempat flea market jual barang she likes to organise things ah jadi pendek kata dia ni baik orangnya
cuma aku rasa tak payah lah aku teruskan niat aku kan sebab dia satu bini orang
aku tak ada besarkan nafsu babe kalau satu hari lelaki dia dapat tahu eh
telefon aku sorry eh itu siti eh saya nama saya manap saya ni suami nya si
perempuan ni lah eh
eh kau kenapa kau tak ada perempuan lain nak cari eh this thing akan terjadi tau kita tak tahu apa yes walaupun lelaki dia main tiga sekali pun tidak bermakna yang aku boleh kacau bini dia
sebab dia masih satu bini orang masih tinggal bersama lagi satu bumbung tau betul tak
jadi aku rasa tak payah lah aku teruskan jadi kalau dia nak bermatair dengan budak tu yang matair grab dia tu ah itu pandai-pandai dia orang lah kan kalau dia orang kena tangkap dia kena kena kena tanya dia jawab kau faham aku tak nak
ah betul tak itu aku punya cerita
iya lah sebab ni pun datang asal nafsu buat apa kalau kau nak jumpa seseorang tu apa sebabnya kau nak kenal perempuan tu agama dia ke kecantikan beliau ke
kerja beliau ke harta ke kau tahu aku pula dalam case nanti aku cakap dengan bini aku very simple aku berdoa kepada allah subhannallah wa taala kalau benar benar
bini orang isteri aku yang cina ni sanggup berubah untuk aku dia sanggup convert agama huh aku bersama dia lapan tahun berumahtangga tak ada anak dia bayar segala-gala untuk aku aku terus cakap dengan kau untuk pengetahuan kau lah kasih kau
aku tinggal dekat rumah dia dekat condominium kan kat telok kurau tu pun kan eh duduk semua dia bayar
duit rumah dia bayar duit tong sampah dia bayar even macam dulu aku bawa kereta kan sometimes lah bulanan punya deposit pun dia bayar tau kereta tau
dulu aku bawa kereta kan mitsubishi dengan aku bawa C class kan jadi dia banyak membantu aku dari segi kewangan dulu aku pernah ada loan dulu aku pernah
ah apa ni ambil loan sampai sini tau dulu-dulu lah dia bayarkan aku punya hutang dia banyak berkorban wang ringgit untuk aku
tapi aku terbuat silap aku terkenal-kenal aku aku terkenal kenalan dengan satu seorang aku aku bilang kau kan
yang perempuan tu yang celaka tu kan jadi aku bilang diri aku kenapa allah bagi aku ujian besar jadi aku bilang dia okay lah untuk aku menghilangkan segala-gala aku punya keperitan aku malam aku kerja aku lupakan si pinoy tu
aku ada harapan kan siapa tahu nanti next counselling session mungkin beliau dapat berikan aku peluang kedua aku tak tahu lah kan kalau itu terjadi aku akan berubah kau akan lihat aku tak macam sekarang
aku rasa sukar tapi aku tidak menafikan segalanya terserah kepada allah taala jadi kalau benar-benar terbuka hati dia tiba-tiba mungkin dia nak kasih aku peluang aku akan pastikan
ini benar-benar berlaku lah aku rasa sukar tapi pada masa sama walupun sukar aku dah buat keputusan kalau katakan lah aku ditakdirkan bercerai kali kedua okay aku akan bergelar duda
tua duda tua eh aku akan bergelarkan duda tua lah tak kisah lah tua ke pun tak kisah jadi aku bilang diri aku kalau aku dah duda tua tak ada duit lagi teruk jadi aku nak jadi duda tua tetapi ada duit kau faham
aku nak jadi orang berduit kirakan aku nak kena kerja kuat aku nak kena banyak berjimat cermat aku nak kena banyak cari kerja dapat kerja dapat allow tarik tau dapat kerja malam pun ambil dapat rezeki ambil simpan betul tak jadi kalau duit ni dah ada nak buat apa okay aku ada hutang kakak aku bayar sikit hutang kakak aku kasih sedekahkan mak bapak aku faham aku bagi apa kau faham keluarga aku dulu aku nak focuskan keluarga aku dulu
kita kerja ramai kawan betul tak kita dapat kawan jadi kalau kau perhatikan eh aku kadang-kadang suka message bebual sama yasir kau tahu kenapa tak yasir dengan aku pun sama dia pun tak ada bini tak ada matair kan yasir
jadi aku dengan yasir berbual pasal dia punya hidup jadi aku suka yasir dulu aku jumpa robert tapi robert dah buat hal kan sekarang dia buat hal sendiri robert aku rasa

kau tahu lah budak-budak muda sekarang kan dia tak peduli tau kalau kau dah ada anak bini tau
dia kalau sukakan kau ah dia punya cara simple tau okay lah kalau you suka I
you ceraikan bini you ah banyak macam gitu babe jadi
tahu tak apa dia orang tak peduli tau
ah kita punya masyarakat zaman sekarang very selfish mereka tak fikir ini semua
jadi kalau kau rasa yang kau engkau mesti ingat tau kau punya tujuan sana kerja
kalau ada situasi macam gini aku tahu ramai lelaki-lelaki kat luar sana yang akan
tak ada kan scandal dia orang lebih suka macam gitu tapi aku rasa kau orang baik kau jangan start ini semua lah tak baik kau tahu asal

itu lah cukup nak kasih dia piss off kau faham perempuan ni
bila dia orang nak bila cara untuk kau macam kasih mereka marah ataupun macam turn off kan
kau sebut nama perempuan lain mereka akan rasa turn off ataupun eh orang rumah kau itu tactic dia
ah jadi kau tanya aku kalau kau kalau kau takde sini macam mana bagi aku eh aku akan teruskan kerja sini macam biasa
aku tak boleh get attracted by your deparute kau tahu asal sebab kalau aku tinggalkan tempat ni kan
aku aku boleh bayankan cheng mun macam mana
he'll be under a lot of pressure faham
kau tahu lah li che tak suka dia
fiona pun tak suka dia aku rasa cheng mun pun mungkin tak suka dia roy pun tak suka dia ramai orang yang mungkin tak begitu suka dengan dia
pun macam gitu aku aniakan dia takkan babe sebab dia dah tolong aku
bila dia pilih aku terima aku bekerja walaupun aku melayu satu jer aku bilang diri aku
kenapa harus aku aniayakan dia aku nak kena support dia
that's why kalau satu hari tadi dia bilang mister see kan kau nampak kan kalau kalau kalau apek boleh tolong
aku akan beterima kasih sebab kirakan engkau pun support aku punya boss
chey syarikat seh kau cakap syarikat macam macam kat malaysia eh
dioye lah sini sini sini punya company ataupun iya lah syarikat untuk your right eh sini punya persatuan ah syarikat company semua ni kan
mereka punya cara satu mereka kalau boleh nak nak save cost ataupun nak kurankan perbelanjaan
dia orang nak kurangkan segala-galanya babe
mereka ada sikit macam apa tu favouritism memang dekat mana-mana semua ada
ah tapi bagi aku
tak ada sebab apa sebab sebab kita punya tu kan mereka dah cari orang tapi orang tu reject orang tu tak nak datang so bagi mereka aku dah buat aku punya kerja tetapi kalau
okay azri nice to meet you again so I just wanna say that kadang-kadang kita ni hidup
memang banyak dugaan life is full of challenges and of course what happens is like
jadi pendek kata kalau kita ni um
uh suka dengan kerja kita kita teruskan betul
kalau kita tak suka maybe dislike ataupun there's push like this then we have to
so in short K kita nak kena tahu
apa jua yang kita buat dalam dunia ini whatever we do here okay
ah jadi macam mana kau nak kekalkan kau punya ah
contohnya tadi aku bilang sama boss aku bilang sama you know aku bilangkan tadi kevin call aku kevin
so kevin came previously so if you saw right I put email dia I emailed him
dia punya request for this um to come down to check look at one eleven kan
was exhaust kau perasan eh so aku nak dia propose based on kita punya requirements apa dia punya exhaust fan size semua lah
so tomorrow he may come down around eleven thirty dia akan turun padang eleven thirty
kita bawa dia tengok tempat itu kan
then boss say kenapa aku cakap because when I try to activate rin cho
he can he macam ah always busy kau faham he got a lot of excuses right and then we he don't want to come then he cannot even give us the required proposals and quotations
so I told boss that I rather do not waste that kind of time and buang masa
tunggu contractor yang tak begitu focus
ataupun yang not really looking for all these things lah so aku bilang dengan boss
ah aku bilang boss ah aku bilang covalent so far is the only company
that have come a few times and then talk to azri and me about what they need kan kau ingat eh
ingat tak the earlier case about the issue at level nine of tower
dengar dengar dengar they are the only one eh that give the proposals for both the air issue and the and the motor you notice
they are the only one tau even Y&T tak kasih eh Y&T belum kasih
Y&T kasih yang dulu punya kau ingat ah Y&T kasih yang lama tu yang kita pernah reject alright
Y&T belum kasih tau ah abeh tu aku nampak ah kai long ada kasih motor oddly eh
air asia tak kasih lepas tu ah ray choo belum kasih abeh tu company C belum kasih
kau bayangkan tau of all kita punya contractor lima company
ini covalent one company can give us that two proposal tau and it's only company kau faham tak
kenapa wani tak nak kasih so it means aku nak kena gunakan dia orang punya specs
nak kena call lagi invite quote for the other company lah that's what aku nak kena bikin later
mana covalent
boleh ah kau tengok kau tengok proposal okay bagi aku okay not bad
dia propose bikin asia semua kan boleh
can be done ah so aku nak kena minta dia orang so whether they want to go or not itu masalah dia sekarang kita nak perlukan we need lagi dua quote betul
ah lagi dua quote kita perlukan lagi dua quote untuk aku bilang kau eh aku macam nak minta lye kasih kita quotation sia untuk aircon works kalau dia boleh bikin
lye boleh
lye lye lye lye ini tau takkan tak boleh
kau cakap orang ke melayu orang putih ni kau cakap orang putih ke melayu nama dia orang putih cakap betul-betul lah
bukan ah aku belum tanya dia lagi tapi aku rasa macam nak panggil dia orang sebab
aku tengok eh macam rin joo
dia kasih kita proposal kan dia rin joo belum kasih tau dia punya proposal I will write to him again
so far I've not really okay you see eh aku tak tahu what was the arrangement before my time
tetapi bagi aku aku still akan invite dia to quote for whatever that he needs to quote lah correct
sebab the idea was given by him correct pasal itu motor correct
so ini semua aku nak kena standby dia punya argument aku nak kena standby any email dapat nak kena tembak email sebab
every month care pax kita nak kena update alexis tau apa dia punya updates kau faham
takpe I will just send them another invite because I'm going to send invite to beberapa contractor jadi I want to see how is ah their
response and memastikan mereka boleh berikan peluang aku tak nak satu hari nanti mereka cakap oh aku penat-penat turun padang I came all the way down meet azri and rasyidi
I gave proposal tapi yang dapat kerja orang lain aku tak nak ini punya cerita
kita dah berbual selama empat puluh dua minit alhamdulillah jadi tak mengapa
okay back to eh kau tahu tak kenapa perempuan korea eh kenapa aku suka tengok zaman sekarang kan bila aku kerja ni kan kerja malam

seorang hamba allah ni kan he's a male indian muslim
he brought his wife and his ah young son for that uh mengaji class
dia punya wife is a japanese convert punya lawa

ah itu jepun convert because aku tanya itu aku punya yang yang ustaz tu rudi kawan aku
dia kata he told me that oh she's a japanese convert oh lawa seh jadi
aku nak cari korean babe kalau kat korea bagus juga eh macam boleh
kenapa kau takut huh
tapi aku tak minat lah dia orang sombong ah babe orang-orang eh semua tak payah lah lebih baik kita ambil orang kampung babe
okay lah diam tak diam jadi tadi kau cakap pasal itu case pasal ini rin joo jadi kalau I will just email him
tengok dia punya reaction if he wants a job then dia akan datang then dia akan datang dan ambil kerja tu
kalau he kalau he gives a good quotation then I mean should be okay if not terpaksa dia akan
ah dipulangkan
ah yang semalam so ah
no no not meter out ni remember dust the dust the diffuser ah so they just want to see the air issue so just show them the air issue because I told them ah aku bilang dengan dia orang
ini tak kena mengena dengan kita tapi aku cakap nevermind kau just tengok kita punya issue you see our air issue
ah kita part kita dah maintain lah jadi tempat kau orang nak kena buat sesuatu so
we just let him know that what have been done and what required by the tenant ah faham
ah aware aware aware ya he will tell victoria meter punya cerita very simple as per fiona's permalas fiona said
this one install okay lah noted noted I not sure I'm here I'm only here six months I'm not sure so dia cakap
ah kata dia lah so okay lah so diam tak diam kirakan yang yang suruh rosakkan
so that is the arrangement lah so tomorrow si covenant turun
we have to focus on this O one eleven exhaust kau tahu pasal
ini benda eh we really need to get the quote soon because richard dah tanya orang pun dah tanya
because ini beruang punya madam F kau si xie
si gemuk tu kan dia nak handover bulan september tau
he wants she wants to handover in september like that kau faham
ah place ah so mereka dia ada plan yang
hebat lah untuk dapat tempat tu tapi
she got some requirement kau nampak there's some that you saw the email I know did you saw
top up dia punya cement twenty five add twenty five
lepas tu half of the probing
then number dua dia kata apa dia nak apa tu then they want to put the
nak letak gas outside lah then they want to puncture to our it is like good to have aesthetics
ah dia dia kirakan they want to do a lot of things okay but but whatever they do
to the centre of the place that is dia orang punya ah so called short floor lah correct
jadi ah twenty twenty five tau look
lepas tu dia orang kat atas ada big kitchen so that the other half eh all the way to the end of the unit is dia orang punya area ah
ah itu naik atas ah naik naik nak naik tu mesti naik punya
tapi kalau kau tak nampak tak obvious ah kan
depan depan the shop front front would not be affected yang belakang dia akan itu
ah they won't akan affect lah because behind they have to put some
ah frosted glass ke apa they have to do something to cover the behind ah
tapi dia orang ada intention nak letak itu gas cylinder itu sebelah kanan
the dia punya piping dia cat warna putih tembus kita punya ah cladding tau masuk dalam above ceiling
toilet eh dia orang kan most likely aku tengok dia orang akan convert sebagai store because dia kata dia tak nak dia punya staff gunakan toilet tu
okay lah I mean tu dia punya hak kan it's up to them
then they can dia orang boleh convert tempat itu untuk macam tempat simpan barang-barang lah
ah to me okay lah I mean as long as dia orang bikin
apa yang dia nak gini tapi so far aku rasa based on my understanding is like
ah cakap dengan fiona I told fiona as and as long as you tie your sprinkler

orang kan adik adik tunjuk ibu kan gambar yang tadi kat corner itu ibu nampak
corner sini pun ibu boleh nampak I see a light like
different colour like ada macam
brown ada green
but you punya gambar
tak betul lah
who say dia gelap
no I said because inside dia punya
facebook dia ada taruh inside nasi dia kat dalam
so that dulang is I know is for four to six pax punya makan lah
so far tak ada yang untuk two pax
so actually I already ordered semua individual before that I already order all because I tengok tak ada
for dulang for two pax is always uh four and above
err macam not so nice like nak kasih uncle one packs two pack like macam
tak lah uncle dombang like kasih like one packet two packet like macam you know
uh apa
in a dulang
you look like macam apa pre pack your food macam ini you taruh dulang like cantik ah nampak ayam nampak semua ah
instead of that ah so that cakap possible not to do this dia cakap yes possible
so ibu cakap okay lah since dia cakap possible so I make a table lah put there
tray lah dulang in a in a dulang lah I cakap
dia cakap ya possible
so after that I send him the table to show that dia jangan salah lah
then okay they can put now dia pergi buat satu dulang
four daging
apa eh
I cakap hidup
if I known I cakap I won't ask you is it possible I ask you is it possible then you said ya ya can
itu that time kelmarin yang
we order takoyaki uh that day satu then after that we order yang nasi yang masa mika datang itu ibu order the tray satu
ayah satu buang lah but we actually ibu nak buang sekali ayah pergi cuci so ibu okay ayah sudah cuci put aside lah so ibu pakai that tray lah
so the rest pasal ibu ada tupperware besar sikit then okay lah put there lah ya
ibu purposely bikin table tau
uh ya lah like macam I I put there berapa eh
okay I put there bento mandi chicken
mutton masala okay that one's all correct memang one bento one packet
then three bento uh bento mandi chicken with add on kofta kebab
okay that one also correct ada tiga mandi chicken with
then I book one set mandi chicken uh buffet for five pax itu yang
dia bikin yang ibu cakap untuk kita kan dia cakap for five pax itu pun okay I he understood one set
then in the end dia kasih kat ibu
ya lah after that ibu call dia lah pasal bila sampai dia kasih ibu like packet dia ibu cakap macam tak nampak that round tray ada empat it's it's only satu but then I don't want to make a fuss I I ah cakap eh this one is only satu jer habis dia cakap ya lah ya lah I'm like just carry jer
just carry bring back itu lah then bila sampai rumah nenek ayah nak pack pack lah kat situ habis kat sana macam panas kan then ibu cakap no lah hantar rumah nenek satu then after that
kita pack pack
uh habis pergi rumah nenek then baru ibu buka ibu buka
satu jer that big round tray with itu habis
then I call her lah I say cakap you know when I say you put in my table I stated there four set what so by right must have four set lah why it's only one if not I just put one set right
otherwise ibu pun tanya dia it's possible because in your photo it's already show what is only five and above punya tak ada one pax for apa one round tray for two pax
entah lah jiu yang hari itu kasih habis after that
dia cakap okay lah habis dia cakap then how ah why like that I have to solve myself lah you ibu cakap
ask me how okay sorry lah this is miscommunication lah dia cakap
habis ibu cakap ya ya ya ya
tapi the night before I think before dia buat I think wednesday
can I just confirm that those bento change to dulang
is four bento of ayam and four bento of daging am I right
so masa itu ibu tengah tengok jadi ibu ibu cakap okay wassalam sis zus yes including four kebab so I think they misunderstood this
bila dia cakap salam can you just confirm yang those bento change to dulang
is four bento ayam and four bento of daging and rice so dia pergi taruh into one dulang
so maybe they refer balik to this
tapi dia tak pergi refer balik to the table then I cakap you look at the table table I put there four set
uh marah lah then
I brought actually I just inform err apa ibu bilang aunty bait jer yang okay no need to cook uh I'm giving you something to eat lah habis aunty bait cakap okay lah so the rest ibu tak bilang uh aunty lisha ibu bilang because ibu takut dia bawa siapa mika pergi swimming
jadi takut dia tak tahu jadi ibu cakap uh I'm sending apa
to you lah habis dia kata no need lah no need save money lah now COVID lah save money I cakap I pay already lah cakap dia cakap don't waste money like that I pay already lah oh you pay already uh uh okay
so I promise ibu sudah cakap aunty bait dengan aunty lisha saja so the rest ibu tak cakap then just imagine kalau semalam ibu sudah balik ibu balik dua belas setengah dua belas setengah balik sini uh pack pack pack sudah pukul berapa orang pun hungry nasib baik ibu tak bilang yang lain ada orang tunggu tunggu kata nak hantar lauk kat mana uh
tapi dia orang hungry macam mana
the one who make noise is ayah bukan ibu lah
of course ibu uh huh angry juga lah but then ibu tak
you know ayah kan the way ayah cakap kan that's why ibu cakap no
sometime we plan but allah yang tentukan yang whether
of course we will nak macam gini tapi we plan but then if asal allah tak izinkan allah cakap no it cannot be planned as what you want I will change the plan so uh if you can like this lah
ah dia bila dia gitu dia diam lah nanti jap ya lah tapi

um dalam bidang kesihatan
and then dalam bidang
um dalam bidang resources um sama lagi satu apa eh aku rasa education
ah tak tahu ah ni empat halalnya investment ah basically ya and I need to have like twenty K at least to
takde tapi ni ni this ah ni tempat kan macam ni nya investment ni agent tak dapat commission tau too kind it's too kind because last times a lot of agents are like promoting I think they get a cut ah but now they don't have so like they stop promoting because they don't get a cut
ya err so aku macam aku macam sekarang macam tengah fikir aku punya lima tahun punya
ah aku punya lima tahunnya plan so aku akan jadi tiga puluh lima tiga puluh lima so sebelum aku tiga puluh lima aku nak um grow aku punya
um side sebelum aku beli rumah and
err side uh aku ah yang yang ni ah yang adam adam tengah buat ni ah ya so ya tu aku nak ada kerja yang aku boleh duduk diam-diam
so aku macam focus kat sekolah-sekolah sebab sekolah-sekolah aku rasa that's the best ah it's the best to macam retired jadi designer lah ada aku sikit hari err apply ni UNICEF eh UNICEF pula what it's called err bukan UNICEF yang apa college entah
ah tapi aku tak rasa aku dapat ah sebab err dia punya position is graphic communication and design
aku lambat mm first one first nya aku bodoh
ya I I dia nya dia nya summary and stuff ah cannot aku tak boleh aku stress
uh sekarang dalam kau nya sekolah ada macam ada macam dorang adopt more uh
apa err kirakan malay>macam tapi bagi kau sebagai cikgu apa pandangan kau
macam kau tahu kau punya kau punya is like uh berapa banyak students pass
but like kan dia macam buat macam barang-barang
barunya system dia buat barang-barang lebih menarik
ah mana mana kita boleh menerima seratus dua lima
apa apa kau punya plan
ah volunteer next week lah dia start tak tahu lah apa dia buat but ah like I told you lah we we started with the orientation online because sekarang we are still in the phase
copyright copyrighting untuk uh tak tahu apa lah dia punya social media punya page lah
tak pergi mana-mana lah this is online because right now we are still in phase two um so we had the orientation online and we can only meet
as as as a as a cancer as cancer society punya volunteer we can only meet when it's phase three because has strict guidelines sekarang uh because people you know cannot meet
tak tahu ah all these blah blah things so ya we had orientation online sedih engkau kau tengok
can do lah macam so I want to do the copyrighting
and then you know the like translation you can do things for macam design uh photography
uh they have macam a knitting crochet with the patients but sekarang takde lah pasal you know it's it's uh only phase two and then they have they do a lot of things ah cancer society they've been around for a long time jadi so they they're very established in the community
is to make you know singapore cancer free really I mean that that's obviously susah
um but they tried uh I think one of the biggest things that they do on a on a yearly basis is uh the apa tu nama dia awareness uh campaigns so they go out in the community and then they have these macam cakap cakap pasal
uh ramai orang macam takut nak buat cancer screening because of course takut lah macam people takut nak buat cancer screening
which in the population in singapore of like five point something million is not a lot lah ya so macam gitu lah ya I'm looking
forward to it lah honestly something I've been wanting to do for a macam dah lama gitu so uh ya inshaallah I'll be able to do quite a lot from next year
no next week they will give me the um they have something in mind I think uh ya and then macam I'll just
tengok lah kalau kalau boleh tolong then I'll do it because you know we're volunteers we're not like new workers
uh but of course they ask that eh no kalau once you commit you have to do it ah bukan macam suka-suka macam this week buat next week tak nak buat ya
you know next year when they start doing uh the actual work that they do I think the first thing chinese new year bila
okay so what they do is on the form in uh apa apa tu during the four main religious group punya holidays so chinese new year is the first one so they do christmas chinese new year
hari raya dengan like deepavali
I think now dia tak buat apa-apa lah this year they cannot do anything but what happens is for these main events they have uh all volunteers come together and kita macam pack pack goodie bags gifts and for chinese new year they have ang pao
so a lot of families you know cannot as it is macam tak boleh afford treatment and then balik rumah rumah macam gitu and then cannot afford to buy food
food they can't afford cab fare to go back and forth so cancer society gives them um like grants and and you know money like contributions uh so the low income families can afford it so for chinese new year they do this but normally they said for chinese new year orang datang like people have to come to them to collect the ang pao um but this may be depending on uh whether or not phase three starts next year lah um I don't know whether that's going to happen ke tak ya so that's next year
kalau tidak boring aje kan buat remotely I'm not going to do just copyrighting
ya why not kenapa tak boleh
oh ya that's one of the things you do when you go to the homes the uh programs where volunteers kemaskan rumah cucikan rumah tau
ya I mean there's lots there's lots that you can do as a volunteer the I mean macam banyak macam program program lah you know there's a lot to do so one of the things ya um ya so they they do cleaning for the patient's homes because a lot of times especially the lower income families
they the caregivers go with the patients to do the treatment and then balik they are both
too penat uh the but um macam especially the patient to do anything else so the cancer society sends in volunteers to go to the house
kemaskan rumah they showed like one house macam eh kesian lah I tengokkan like it's quite sad like you know because they really don't first of all they don't have the money to
you know a lot of donations for food and stuff so you know just makanan bawa pergi rumah dia
and stuff like that lah so it's a lot of things that are happening for them and I think that that's why they regularly have macam apa tu volunteer drive so this was the latest volunteer drive and I signed up for it
a'ah macam gitu
because you're not I mean you're not you're not like it's not like you're signing a contract untuk apa kan and it's really up to you
but buat apa ni
but but wait the dogs dari mana
the dogs kat mana
the one dekat
tengah oh ah dekat ya that's true
ini because of the uh apa ni benda ni ah
even with the ini the dogs and the cats
like dog walker pun tak boleh
ambassador ni untuk apa
untuk for like companies lah
ambil gambar apa oh okay
so the fosterers untuk anjing-anjing kucing-kucing like is it is it only untuk the dogs or untuk kucing-kucing also
so when you say volunteer with doing this maknanya you take on the volunteer work with the money as well
like in the in the sense that you bayar untuk semua bende ni semua
so who pays for punya clinic like they have this clinic and they are themselves they are themselves a charity so they have
wow that must cost a lot of money I mean but but now that you said that they have their own clinic clinic must mean that they must be doing okay to set it up macam sekarang dah macam
ada lah duit sikit gitu lah
G O V ni apa
what is the nama oh okay
iya lah charity lah I mean they don't expect the government nak kasih semua orang duit mana ada duit government gets the money dari kita taxpayers as well
sorry the priority number one priority is to the orang-orang
apa masalah if you if the government don't have enough money to macam apa tu cakap
to give macam to give enough so that the citizens are okay then you know the priority has to be us the citizens instead of kasih anjing-anjing
apa punya development
mana kita ada jungle what we don't have any jungle
but do you all know you know as volunteers of uh and working in this working in this uh apa tu dia sector does the government actually have a plan uh when when macam like they go now kat belakang ni like there's this
tengah tengah this new development kat tengah kat belakang sini
do you know do these groups which are know if the government has a macam apa tu cakap
bukan contingency lah tapi macam plan lah like a plan when they develop these new lands
but they've been developing singapore for how long takkan lah macam sampai sekarang tak tahu
mm pasir ris pun ada babi
but how can it be macam gini like because it has been going on for so long it's not as if macam kita baru start nak develop lands or takeover lands it's been macam we've been we've been building
and and other housing since bila kita punya independence nineteen sixties ah
so that's only the dogs because I know dekat pasir ris when I went uh pasir park ya I saw the wild boar was right there in front of me behind the fence
ya because recently kan ada perempuan tu yang kena attack tu
eh kau punya kerusi ni gatal seh
gatal lor
ya but I'm okay I always sit there I'm okay jangan duduk situ
kesian spoke but so what what happens so who
uh tapi it's been there for awhile dengan macam
terus kasih lah I always said that
tapi so when you
okay so I understand because I can see all the apa anjing-anjing kan I can see
and the uh siapa nama tu
who takes care who is supposed to because kat sini I've seen satu just one snake and
apa ACRES
he's a syrian refugee dia tinggal dekat lebanon
so this was his part of his second exhibit and I really really loved it anyways ah cakap macam gitu
so no honestly uh apa cakap ular-ular
it's not as easy as oh nampak anjing oh uh nampak babi we can see it we can you know some kind of action the ular ni you know macam kat bawah-bawah and then in the longkang-longkang you never know and then the fear is until they come up through the drains which has happened of course before but eh takut
uh snakes because I mean we we don't often hear about uh ular macam ular coming out there are not as many sightings as dogs and and the wild boars especially so
are there I mean I've only seen satu kat sini
and and then dia macam masuk dalam longkang and then it just like slithered away but it was enough for me to macam takut uh because I can't I betul betul there's one thing I cannot do is reptiles and and snakes and like big lizards tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh so
so the thing is dekat here in in where where I am where I live sometimes I do see the um the stray dogs there is a family of three kadang-kadang macam during the day I can see them they like to sleep under the vans
one auntie dia um auntie tinggal kat tak tahu block mana she comes around to feed the cats so she was telling me the other day that uh dulu dia kena saman because she fed the dogs
so I don't I don't know anything about macam people feeding uh stray cats or stray dogs but auntie ni sometimes I give her some money because she buys a lot of food untuk she feeds a lot of stray cats macam she brings macam besar you know macam orang-orang macam ini um
ya so she was telling me so she doesn't she doesn't do the dogs anymore because she's afraid of getting um for dia dia cakap dia kena
kena saman so I don't know I don't know how true that is ya
tak tahu lah auntie I don't know I mean I'm not going to go check after her the problem is auntie sekarang pun nak kena she has to be careful because she also puts out uh
air untuk kucing-kucing ni so the problem is our area kat sini is a high dengue area
what do you mean two hours to clear siapa yang pergi check
siapa yang nak catch
what do you mean walk past lepas tu kena fine tak boleh feed but you can feed right
I don't understand this this this two hours ni
how do they know macam who keeps tabs on these two hours thing
um tapi kau duduk situ so you have to like sit there and watch the cat eat until it's finished
mesti clear lah
tapi dia the feeder mesti clear makanan tu
ah because then you attract all the all the like cockroaches and a'ah betul ya that's true
lepas tu kalau kena tangkap saman dia how much is the saman
takde lah mana ada kat sini signs
ya but the the cats kat sini bagus juga lah and honestly the cats around here gemuk-gemuk because of macam auntie macam gini and this
eh apa kat belakang ni there are couple of cats who always come around and they they get fed more than one person
about the same kat sini so every morning when I this my my block when when when I when I wake up to to and I go to the you know the bathroom peep there are
six six-ish in the morning I hear sausage who is the neighbourhood cat who is so cute nama dia sausage aku kasih nama jer lah so I I sausage comes and I can hear sausage meowing because I'm on the third floor I can hear sausage meowing from the downstairs
sampai uh auntie kat bawah ni you know I can hear the auntie coming out and feeding him that's sausage
and then as the day goes on when I like look out the window um I can see someone else coming there's another man kat dia tinggal kat I think like behind this block
he comes and he feeds sausage again sausage ni honestly I've never seen stray cats
I mean uh macam the the
size tu macam comparable to a domestic cat like a cat punya kat kat rumah orang ya ya a pet cat
so you know they were they were they're they're well taken care of kat sini I always see the same cats around here so you know that people that they feel safe
have run away dulu we used to see more of the dogs
uh during the day especially during the circuit breaker this is what I notice I first saw them during the circuit breaker ya because takde orang keluar kan
so I saw them dia selalu tidur under the this lorry because orang pun tak kerja so they were like always sleeping the three of them
so I don't know what happened to them ya ya so during circuit breaker when there were a lot of animals not just the kucing but the aunties still came around to feed the cats that one betul I always see that
the birds the birds now I don't hear them anymore uh anjing tak dah takde lagi
ya it was a good period when we had the circuit breaker because there were lots of birds that every morning I could hear them it was nice we had kat depan ni right in front here there's these two big palm trees kan so
the imperial pied pigeon came during the circuit breaker which is not a common sighting in this neighbourhood macam this um once or twice we've seen them along the macam apa tu the park connector here at bukit batok going up to clementi but they came here the whole there were like there first of all dia hantar satu agaknya macam scout came scout nampak pokok ni scout stayed there so I took gambar lah dengan camera tu and then the next week few more came
yes because they eat the apa ni I don't know what the fruit is of this thing the family came imperial pied piegon it was really nice here ya I have pictures of them
ya but it's this tree yes but for them to fly all the way here is another method now that there are there's more traffic they like the quiet places so now they're back in when I was dekat apa jalan dekat park connector tu I can see them back at the park connector because there's no traffic is right next to big longkang
they are so you see kat sana ada the egrets so again during the circuit breaker when you know the only thing you can do is keluar pergi
jalan you know everybody suddenly everybody pergi uh exercise so in that apa tu nama dia longkang the otters all came out so the otters the egrets
the animals crossing the path tak ada lagi during circuit breaker you could see different kinds of animals
uh but it was nice it was nice because at then even then the otters came out and everybody would stop um and they would do their swimming swimming but tu macam exhibitionist tau the otters are huge exhibitionists
okay we don't get those kinds of otters in the in the longkang where did they go to the uh the botanic garden
so they came out macam every night
tak tahu lah
but they're not the ones yang kat dalam longkang ni they're not that big dekat sini kat park connector the one that goes up to pandan
jangan bedek lah kau cakap different family different types lah
what do you mean mana ada clan
macam apa clan
eh kau jangan tipu lah macam mana boleh gini
eh kau macam eh kau jangan bedek lah I mean sorry this is not
like on the ground macam they go and macam nak nak pergi cari
ah okay like like the people who go sungei buloh cari burung cari burung ah okay okay okay
but they all look the same apa macam mana nak ada divide
so the one yang that I say kat sini
during the circuit breaker kan so I read about the one yang
so do they macam pindah from one place to another or when you say dia orang macam this otter clan kallang clan do they just live there atau macam
they come kat sini to look for the
bukit batok clan what what I honestly don't understand macam mana ni
lepas tu kalau dah nak kahwin macam mana of course you have to look for orang lain kan
lepas tu sekarang macam mana where do they go now like I've haven't seen them in a while
so macam do you think they like live there in in the botanic gardens that kind of and and dia orang macam what what I don't understand about okay in this case is the otters
macam during the circuit breaker macam okay so that one whole family keluar pergi serangoon road nak pergi cari apa tak tahu apa eh when is it that they know they can they can go somewhere else like at do they go at night
like right now the clan from botanic gardens I because I find it hard to believe that that they just macam duduk kat situ aje
so in snakes I snakes I understand snakes you slither I've seen the snakes kat sini in the drain
how did the otters from macam botanic gardens pergi
kat sini like bukit batok because there is a whole we we see a lot in bukit batok at the park connector in the longkang
like do they get tagged by apanya nama dia ACRES
two thousand so we did not hear about otters in singapore because and then when I came back here for a break like about two years ago then I people were talking about macam on social media pun tengok gambar-gambar orang tunjuk all the otters knew there was once kat clementi uh near sixth avenue that big longkang
and I was walking past then I actually saw the otters in the apa longkang besar
um but I don't understand like when I left singapore in two thousand and three did we have otters then or is it macam a new development that they came from somewhere
eh kau jangan bawa telephone kau masuk toilet boleh nanti orang dengar
kau can you please not macam gini this lucah can you please close the door
so ya that's what I'm saying because dulu I mean growing up here we did not hear about otters
ya lah wildlife ya lah of course aware but takkan lah what I'm saying is takkan lah dulu honestly I mean I grew up in kampung we did not hear about all these otters during kampung dulu kampung banyak benda of course we had the monyet we actually had the monyet uh then
but we I don't know about I don't even have that kind of memory growing up in kampung but we had the big longkang-longkang
so takkan lah I mean couldn't have been that they
how did they come about to be in the macam the public's consciousness
so these otters do they get tagged do they get tagged macam apa tu namanya microchipped
do they no I mean when you say they care for them bukan macam it's it's not like what you guys not like what you guys do at macam you can't walk the otter
in singapore do they have them macam untuk ular-ular
because I mean we have a lot of snakes in singapore kan I mean we just don't see them because they are really good at macam just hiding away and going into the longkang
but how do you macam if if you say like the last time I walking to westmall then I saw this snake it just goes into the longkang then it just disappears
oh I I remember dulu dekat the the kat mana tu I don't know what lah it was in the news was it a python
so what happens when ACRES comes when apa the the snake now it has the
kucing the kucing is in the perut
but they have to catch it and release it somewhere else kan tak kan macam redhill kat bawah block tak kan you you can't just leave it there
kalau gelak-gelak continue ini lah
okay akak lah share dulu
sixty percent banyak juga itu sixty percent
mm mm ini sebab semua orang dekat rumah kan
rasanya eh bukan
sudahnya sudah tak ingat tapi kalau biasa kalau sebut goal untuk setiap tahun kan
tak lah masih hiburan macam tahun-tahun lepas tak berjaya
maintain a'ah tapi
ya lah sebab kan ada masalah spine so
macam mana pun kena turunkan berat badan tapi itu lah masalah sampai sekarang tak boleh turun-turun
a'ah so itu tak tercapai lah kan
kalau segi err financial tercapai lah
sebab target dua puluh dua puluh nak simpan err lima belas K
lepas itu dari segi kerja kan nak kerja
maksudnya yang kerja yang kerja baru lah kan environment semua
dapat lah sebab sekarang sudah kerja dengan
walaupun untuk masa sekarang contract kan tapi at least sudah bertukar lah
something new lah okay dari segi
err ibadat pun rasa macam teruk banding dengan dulu kan dulu kan waktu student kan dia macam
affect result lah macam tak tapi sekarang macam makin teruk kan padahal makin tua makin ingat tuhan kan tapi
mm ya lah banyak doa doa nak rebut jodoh jer asyik jodoh jer kan tapi
ya lah benda itu tak seiring dengan yang sepatutnya ah itu
macam nak kahwin lah nak kahwin
tapi tak tak ada rezeki untuk kahwin so kita bawa kepada tahun ini lah dua puluh dua puluh satu lagi apa ah
um dari segi apa lagi ah dari segi
hubungan dengan keluarga tu makin rapat sikit lah sebab
err since kan memang ada dekat rumah
so memang kita orang kita orang satu family semua dekat-dekat
maksudnya kita orang banyak masa bersama macam itu lah
sebab sebelum ini memang ida daripada metrik memang jauh daripada family ida saja yang jauh
a'ah so sekarang macam oh banyak lah masa dengan dia orang so macam lebih memahami lah lebih lebih menerima
itu bukan dia pasal dua puluh dua puluh satu eh
decision yang membawa kepada itu
mm tak cukup sepuluh ini
oh macam ida cakap tadi ah dari segi financial ah itu memang kita sudah nampak kan memang
hundred percent achieve kan lepas tu yang kedua oh satu lagi ida
dengan business ah
err a'ah dengan business err lagi satu
err dua puluh dua puluh
err apa ini tahun yang sangat menguntungkan lah ida bagi ida dalam bidang Shaklee sebab
monthly ida dapat maintain income empat angka
ah macam seribu minimum seribu tiga ah
macam itu sebab kita kat rumah kan eh so kita banyak masa dengan phone so kita nak focus ah dengan business online
so apa lagi ah achieved a'ah lepas itu
mm dapat kerja macam cakap saya tadi apa lagi ah
mm okay dapat publish dua paper
okay empat
a'ah empat lepas itu um

apa lagi ah ya allah teruk ah
okay oh saya
oh sebab ida pun terkejut macam wah banyaknya
ida sudah ida ida berjaya call ida ida berjaya membantu orang dari segi emosi lah kan
seramai seribu lebih kurang ah seribu empat ratus orang
ah ah ya sepanjang orang yang berada di di pusat kuarantin kan
a'ah lagi apa lagi ah
oh sebab tahun dua puluh dua puluh kan sekarang kita sudah ada
seorang yang ida bantu untuk dia
a'ah so ida macam bagi dia ida berjaya lah bagi dia semangat untuk siapkan
dia at least dia sudah nampak
at least dia sudah ada chapter one till five
walaupun belum nak pass
okay so sudah cukup kan tak cukup lagi eh
okay lagi satu kan um ida sudah ya lah kita anak kan kita rasa macam
kita nak bantu parents kan kita nak bagi duit setiap bulan
okay err sebelum ini dua puluh dua puluh itu ida dah ida maintain
err ida berjaya maintain setiap bulan tanpa miss
ida bagi dekat dia orang uh tiga angka seorang ah macam tu
so ida macam okay so hopefully dua puluh dua dua puluh satu ini
ida berjaya maintain lah bagi mungkin boleh increase
um macam itu ah sebab sebelum ini kan tak ada duit
pendapatan oh okay okay bagus
tak ada lah kot can
oh dia tak yakin ah
because apa
macam rude dia itu bagus ke
project tak dapat jalan
terlalu painful tak percaya ya
saya um dengan bahasa yang sopannya saya putus cinta
then yang lagi yang lagi painful adalah
err kan so so memang saya tak dapat nak buat apa-apa tak akan lah saya nak
suruh dia putuskan hubungan kan so saya terpaksa terima lah
the most lah kan lepas itu second
second err waktu first
eh itu first COVID ini datang saya rasa macam oh sangat struggle
sebab sebelum ini you tak pernah duduk rumah tanpa buat apa-apa
so then tak pernah duduk rumah selama itu
kan biasa berjauhan dua-dua buat kerja so saya rasa benda itu sangat
sangat menyakitkan lah untuk untuk that okay
yang okay saya dalam hidup kan
so adalah yang rapat kan dua tiga orang
then yang paling menyakitkan tahun ini adalah
a'ah tahun okay dua puluh dua puluh kan
yang dua puluh dua puluh ya like bila kita sudah tak ada kawan kita ada kawan rapat saja at
of course lah kita punya expectation itu
tinggi kan sebab ya lah kita tak ada siapa-siapa so
err untuk tahun dua puluh dua puluh oh saya baru tahu dia kawan
so dia kawan adalah untuk untuk err kawan untuk waktu susah
ah waktu dia susah ha waktu dia susah lepas tu
err saya pantang kalau orang menipu ha saya memang pantang
so ada satu hari itu dia cakap dia sudah balik semenanjung
tapi waktu itu kebetulan saya ada dekat airport
so memang terang-terang dia dia itu ada dekat airport okay dia bagi tahu dia sudah balik dua hari lepas
okay kebetulan dua hari kemudian itu saya pergi airport
so saya nampak dia dekat airport so maksudnya dua hari sebelum itu dia belum balik
dia masih ada dekat sini tapi dia cakap dia sudah balik huh
so memang terang-terang itu kak itu dia okay
so saya rasa kepercayaan saya tertipu lah kenapa dia kenapa dia nak menipu
bagi tahu saja lah a'ah
so saya rasa kalau benda itu
benda itu dia balik eh eh salah
tak payah sebut tempat eh
ya lah benda yang besar macam itu dia boleh tipu uh ya lah dia nak balik daripada
daripada sini naik flight kan dia boleh tipu lagi lah benda lain
kan yang kecil-kecil saya rasa macam
susah lah untuk terima okay lain tak ada kot okay tiga saja
yang saya rasa betul adalah saya buat keputusan untuk saya stay di sini
untuk masih ah berada di sini jauh daripada keluarga walaupun saya cakap tadi
saya punya relationship dengan keluarga sudah makin bagus kan tapi saya masih tetap
familiar untuk di sini berada jauh daripada keluarga jauh daripada
itu lah
kita pun struggle
uh apa soalan itu tadi about decision kan
first ya lah bila saya pilih kat sini then err waktu hari itu saya dapat kerja saya dapat tawaran juga dekat terengganu tahu
a'ah sebenarnya
yang pilihkan itu salah apa lagi ah
okay lagi apa ah
tak ada sudah kot
kan tak ada sudah kot
apa ah
sama saja lah
ya lah someone special pun tak ada lagi
mungkin tinggal house mate lah house mate
dua jenis saja lah
siapa ah
mungkin saya punya mentor dalam business lah kot
okay the business Shaklee kan saya punya mentor
a'ah itu dari segi financial lah sebab dia
err dia manage untuk dapat income err
six figures setiap bulan
a'ah which is seratus ribu lebih ah setiap bulan so dia memang million earner lah
itu dari segi financial lah
okay dari segi
oh kalau macam dari segi ibadah kan benda yang baik macam
neelofah lah kot sebab saya sekarang baru saya follow dia dia punya telegram
a'ah so dia banyak share kan dia banyak ya lah dia dia
dia macam dulu ya lah yang kita yang kita nampak artist kan social tapi
dia punya ilmu macam makin lama makin ah improve dia punya sharing
pasal hadis lah pasal benda yang baik-baik itu rasa macam ya allah bagusnya macam itu
so satu lagi oh seorang lagi ini lah saya punya sahabat lah lelaki
err yang saya panggil dia bapa so sometimes dia macam
err sangat memberi inspirasi lah untuk settle scandal itu macam bersemangat
err oh expect sebab dia counsellor kan maksudnya dia dia punya mentor saya juga lah
so kadang okay dia banyak bagi saya support lah inspirasi
yang tak tahu masa eh ini
a'ah tak semestinya positive kan
untuk dua puluh dua puluh ini ramai lah
sebab dia macam ada dua fasa tau
yang satu keluarga lah sepanjang kan berapa enam bulan kan
so dengan family so dengan dengan parents lah dengan parents
dengan anak buah dengan parents dengan mak ayah anak buah dengan kakak
dengan house mate lah ah itu lah
oh okay ya apa-apa nak duduk call
oh dia orang memang influence ah
kalau kalau macam family tak ada lah influence sangat kan
itu macam biasa saja lah okay kadang ya lah kadang kita yang sendiri minta
dia orang suggest apa-apa kan so tak ada lah cerita-cerita mengarut sangat kan
so cuma kita consider lah kan
tapi yang paling adalah bapa lah itu dari dari segi semua lah
pasal saya punya kerjaya saya punya financial
lepas tu ah pasal kehidupan lah
ya so mostly yang semua nasihat semua ida ikut eh ida ikut saya ikut
okay sebab saya ini bukan yang jenis orang yang baca buku
menyalahkan a'ah
ada satu buku ah buku ada satu buku ini ida pernah baca tajuk dia walking tau
ya lah ida tak ingat sangat isi dia tapi ida ingat ah buku itu
buku warna hijau kan dia nipis saja buku itu buku itu banyak cerita pasal ini lah
pasal kegagalan lah so macam mana dia bangun untuk terus berjalan
aku kena cari balik yang ada tak so apa lagi ah
okay ada satu buku ini buku cinta tahu
bukan dia macam buku romantic lah ida cakap tajuk dia I love you
buku itu tebal sangat ah buku orang putih juga
um I tajuk dia I love you so buku ini
um oh dia dia macam flashback balik uh uh penulis dia perempuan lah
dia flashback balik apa yang berlaku sepanjang dia bersama dengan kekasih dia
a'ah so err saat kekasih dia sudah mati kan
lepas itu dia tapi perit dia dia dia sudah tua lah so dia memang sudah spend
err so dia dia flashback balik daripada zaman dulu macam mana dia kenal macam itu lah
so kadang dia dia macam
okay before before lelaki itu meninggal lelaki itu sakit tau so before itu dia sudah
okay dia isteri dia dia memang err sangat dependent pada suami uh kekasih dia
ah so bila ya lah orang putih biasa lah kan tak kahwin so
dia sebelum oh dia sakit dia sakit lepas itu dia makin critical so
dia macam nak ajar uh perempuan itu untuk berdikari
so err sepanjang sebulan lebih dia banyak menulis
so macam okay dia dia akan tulis dan dia akan simpan note note
dia dia tak tulis dalam buku tapi dia buat note macam sticky notes dia tampal dekat situ macam dekat
ah mana-mana lah dia suruh do eh dia tinggal notes ah
lepas itu lah bila suami dia meninggal so dia nak buat eh
bila kekasih dia meninggal so bila dia nak buat itu dia akan jumpa notes itu
a'ah macam itu so benda itu
dia dia tulis lah buat macam flashback kan ah so dia rasa macam
oh maksudnya walaupun kekasih dia sudah meninggal tapi benda itu ada ditinggalkan so dia rasa
ah macam itu ah banyak ah a'ah lepas itu sebelum dia meninggal tu
err macam bulan depan akan birthday perempuan ini
so dia tinggal lah something yang perempuan ini boleh celebrate
ah macam itu sangat sweet a'ah
so dia sudah tempah orang hantar bunga
okay macam itu ah dia sudah prepare so ada lah note dia yang dia tulis so perempuan itu rasa macam
memang perempuan itu sedih tapi dia dia dia dia mesti dia sudah accept
so dia hidup bersama dengan lelaki itu walaupun lelaki itu sudah meninggal ah sebab itu tajuk dia I love you
gitu lah
yang to do
tak ada akak buku tak lah baca buku sebab sekarang kan
tak ada buku ini buku ini sebanyak kan online kan so so sudah terlupa macam itu
ya lah kalau tak lah kan indonesia buat macam itu sekarang kan
okay satu yang paling ida bersyukur sekali adalah
ida dapat bangun dan ida dapat move on daripada pengalaman pahit ida sebelum ini
kan bila kita sudah bila bukan kita bila ida sudah
so sebab kan macam sebab kita orang okay tiba-tiba saja macam itu kan so kita macam eh ida macam
eh gila ah tapi memang betul-betul gila tapi ida mampu untuk bangun sampai sekarang
a'ah macam itu okay lagi satu
lagi satu ida bersyukur sebab ida masih dapat berfungsi dengan baik tau sebab kadang-kadang
macam ida boleh sekarang ida boleh pergi kerja hadap jam kan
duduk kereta lama kan sebab kan ida ada masalah spine kan so macam
setiap pagi boleh bangun pergi toilet itu ida rasa macam sudah bersyukur at least ida boleh bangun sebab ida pernah
err tak boleh bangun tak boleh berjalan
ah so bila setiap hari boleh bangun pergi toilet boleh boleh duduk
dalam kereta boleh hadap jam boleh drive sebab sebelum ini orang drive kan
so ida rasa macam okay setiap hari oh ada benda yang memang ada benda yang patut disyukurkan ah macam itu

that's how he won the millennial punya vote ah eight years back he was one of the first few politicians who was actively like in
come on look look at michelle obama all very ya quite influential in terms of macam presidents
because she's one thing because she's a woman lah and women of colour is another thing and then she is like not not not like black like she's like latino ah and then another thing macam she very fierce
for the benefit of the people you all don't want then you all macam
no the thing is dia world and then people still believe him I like sial ah and recently his rallies all the people wear mask wear at all but when did he ever come out with a negative test
like sometimes they ask celebrities like especially macam controversial issues lah
pissed right he got angry he tweet out and then he say because of the fake news media I will release the video first before the sixty minute come out then I like that's his hit back macam you gonna release it first because he wants to say that macam they gonna portray it like differently but then macam
tak kan they repeat the loop and you didn't realise in one hour right
ya I mean if you say you love the bible right it's like saying you love the quran oh which surah you like you know then you like oh I don't know man like it's private then I'm like
ya no the thing is like no I that people oh ya there was one one guy you know there's this guy that time macam oh who you voting for like that time what he does these interviews with trevor noah like he does these interview at trump rallies and ask all these questions about conspiracy theories and whatever shit lah
so that time he was asking like oh ah ape

I'm going to complain complain man mm you ain't coming down macam sial

but macam if there's a lift and then you got an excuse lah
tak pe ah become the cashier ah buka sendiri you know take out the cash
I would mengamok sia like fuck you man
jangan bodoh bro
so dia orang like um
dia orang want to dia orang exit already tapi dia orang nak masuk balik so when they want to masuk balik and then like the security guard stop them lah
so ya so they they block the way and then like before that I saw them go out already but dia orang like um
they insisted coming in lah and then lepas tu they block the way and then this security guard was like um he turned a bit and he accidentally touched the wife's hand like arm the wife's arm ya correct so he was like accidentally touched lah lepas tu dia
lepas tu dia punya couple tak happy lah habis tu dia orang um so like the security guard
lepas tu dia cakap oh like I nak pergi beli uh I nak pergi ambil allen key
ah dia nak pergi ambil allen key lah daripada dia punya service counter lepas tu um
after they take the like they want to take the allen key lepas tu dia cakap eh err please tell him do not touch people I'm like okay sure but like honestly I looked at it and then they were blocking the exit and then they were stopping like at least ten people from moving so it's dia orang punya pasal lah
err when when they left I ask this security guard lah like you know um like tak kisah pasal dia orang lah sebab dia orang um they they were trying to be difficult lah because you are just stopping them from entering once they exited because there's only one way exit one way enter right
so lepas tu another security guard datang lepas tu dia cakap oh err this couple lah they have a problem lah they told me already like about how the other security guard tried to touch the wife then like I also question mark lah why why
why um why do you err err how did he touch in the first place lepas tu
dia dah cakap lepas tu they leave the security guard feel okay maybe this one is just a problematic customer lah
lepas tu there's no allowed nobody's allowed to eat in the store
eh tak boleh cakap nama dia
tak boleh cakap nama store
tapi like you are not supposed to eat there lah because
takut you expose yourself to
ya lah lepas tu dia argued dia cakap oh my wife is eating I'm not eating and I'm taking the allen key
lepas tu we're like no
jadi dia cakap lor you know like um
correct because technically this virus is gonna extend until one year so like you you cannot just like sit down kat rumah and then like melepak tengok tengok youtube macam my bapa so that's fucking unproductive I don't like it
oh like you're doing this you're doing that you know at the end of the day you're gonna get like pahala I'm like sometimes kan you buat kerja bukan pasal pahala you nak buat kerja pasal you nak care for the person you know
lepas tu you tengah cleaning buntut lagi
you nangis
ya lah tapi you nangis ke tak
macam you kasih birth to anak tu lepas tu anak tu yang nak mati dulu kind of thing
wow nasi rawon bukan nasi biasa tau
you tahu kenapa tak pasal I would think that he thinks like you are more easy to manipulate and you are more kind so kalau you are more easy to manipulate and you're kinder even though it sounds like bastard to say
tapi like you know people like to tend to take advantage of these things macam even when like I'm usually like I'm usually a kind person and all that right and then like you know after awhile you notice like oh I feel like they are taking advantage of me then like I will just stop lah or just like you know I can't do this for you anymore
because like memang like I think it's just human nature lah like they trying always trying to find ways to take advantage of people but I just find that is not a way to live your life
tu memang dah macam amanah lah pasal dia sedekah gaji itu kan
mm alhamdulillah banyak rezeki
you macam apa tu um in debts lah
me right simply if I really care for that person I don't mind but like at the same time like kalau is those people that I'm not close to or whatever right then like um
like it'll be nice if he would I mean like for me I think he would feel that it's nice if you could send him off you know you know I mean macam like bila dia dia dah nak meninggal kan habis you ada kat sana
tapi at the same time meh pasal dia punya selfish thoughts macam begitu he should let you go because
like you know you need to go and live your life because after he dies maybe in like one or two years I don't know I'm not praying for him to die but like bila dia dah meninggal like you have to live your life and his ah if he's asking you to sacrifice your life
just to jaga dia bila masa you nak you nak belajar
lagipun dia ada banyak family around here daddy is swag
correct because I mean I understand lah kalau you ada family kan tapi tak close dengan family tu macam like saudara saudara tak tak rapat kan
tapi like um in terms of helping right ya lah like that lah but like like you just have to help your family lah you know
like my um my side of the family is like kalau ada kerja kahwin or kenduri right my family will be the one as helping the rest of the family near extended family they be like the women will be busy makeup lah blah blah blah all that shit I'm like
lepas tu like one of them had even the cheek to say like when at that point kan they will like going to get married soon they'll like eh nanti bila kita kahwin uh
kau orang suka tolong-tolong kan nanti kita err kita kahwin kau orang tolong ah this kind of things it's like
I don't think that's how you should behave lah because then you see the core of your personality you know lepas tu like this particular cousins they are like always
ah even when there is a wedding they tak datang on time dia orang datang lambat even the people that they're supposedly close to ah like like these cousins these two cousins are so like is apparently close but then even on that cousin's wedding day
the close cousin pun datang lambat so I feel like ni apa punya attitude ni lepas tu dia orang dah kahwin and they're going to breed this kind of
job but err my step mum ada lah tanya dia cakap ada cukup duit tak then I'm like ya cukup cukup cukup
tapi like I told you before right like my father memang apa macam babi like you know like he fucking like um tengok
tengok youtube every single day pukul
sixty only ya and he watches he watches youtube in the fucking morning and then when I want to mengaji then he on the bloody video damn loud then I can't concentrate you know
after that ustazah he just wants to watch because he's bored nobody wants to talk to him
like like then after that I ustazah say lah like like you know like
err perlahan-perlahan lah baca lah kat bawah buku tu ada cakap baca dengan perlahan kalau err perlu err ulang lah lagi tapi I cakap dengan ustazah ustazah bapa saya tengah main video saya tak boleh concentrate lepas tu ustazah macam awkward lah macam oh okay
for me right my my bapa is
macam pemalas jer gila babi tau
like satu dia like dah lama tak kerja and he's just err waiting for government to give him money
and then like um err what do you call that like dia tengok youtube videos every single day pagi-pagi pukul tujuh setengah dia boleh on kuat-kuat until like late at night he watches but nowadays because the other day he confessed to me he never pay
um electricity bills for two months can you imagine that shit he never pay for two months habis dia nak dia nak siapa yang bayar
dia tak nak kerja then um ya then I just keep quiet lah like it's your problem what I mostly not at home and you are the one who's youtubing like the whole bloody day so I'm like whatever lah you know
err he got his heartbroken and dia dia nak console lah kawan dia lah
lepas tu kawan dia punya crush
err slept with eh will slept with a friend when she was drunk so like technically like for me lah I like dia tu bukan you punya girlfriend couple dia punya crush sahaja you you nak sad sad lepas tu you nak macam ada apa tu nama dia macam
you nak um act as if she's your girlfriend for what you know
lepas tu my my my my my my brother just had to bloody say that uh oh kawan dia actually kaya dia macam from a well to do family lah lah lah lah
do you know what my father say he say um oh jadi kalau kalau adik kalau um pergi keluar dengan dia eh nanti dia nak dia nak belanja tak belanja belanja coke ke apa ke
lepas tu macam mana you tak darah up kan so I darah up I cakap
kalau nak kalau nak ah jumpa kawan bukan minta upah apa lepas tu dia dia cakap
err dia cakap dia macam nak weekend excuse lah macam dia joking but I wasn't having it I was angry
lepas tu what the
ya I mean like fuck man like dia dah tak nak kerja dia selalu nak my father lah dia tak nak kerja dia selalu nak tunggu orang kasih dia duit dia lah pemalas
put clothes in the the washing machine and then err gantung which takes less than fifteen minutes honestly
and then like he expects the women at home to do all the shit for him like kerja um kemas rumah masak lipat baju makingkan dia kopi
I mean mm tapi kalau you old school kan you kerja apa
jadi dia nak tunngu orang kasih dia duit aje macam apa macam babi tau and then I even have like I'm working with a guy um this pakcik he's about seventy plus seventy two
dia masih kerja I saw like another one is like I'm sure he's about seventy plus eighty lah this other old man and he's so handsome you know he so energetic he's a handsome old man
you know what excuse does my father have to to not work and like like lounge around and wait for somebody to macam kasih dia duit you know what you mean lepas tu I tak suka tinggal dekat rumah sebab I tengok dia unproductive I rasa macam beban tau like
oh kakak you know err we were talking about how when you die right and then um um
there's an option for you to stay with your husband or wife in the in the bumi right
my step mum cakap dia tak nak jumpa my bapa
ya lah so in bumi you ada mark like husband and wife right tapi in syurga you nak you you still want to be together or not
ah my mum say tak nak myself say
I can see sometimes he's caring but ah as as the days go by as I watch him every single thing he say triggers me in a sense that macam became geram became macam kau dah lah pemalas tak nak buat kerja kau also nak meminta-minta dekat orang buat apa
lagipun right half of our lives he never raise us and huh correct dia tak kasih nafkah pun jadi macam mana dia nak expect kita yang anak-anak yang ada yang empat empat yang dah besar ni nak selalu kasih dia duit ke apa ke correct
I mean we don't think like that lah tapi my mum is the one who thinks like that but at the same time we think like okay I will just give what we can give but we will not give our father we will give our step mum
until my step mum macam berasa macam bersalah lepas tu dia cakap oh nanti err ni siapa dah kasih duit siapa dah kasih duit
ya so for me right usually kalau I nak kasih I kasih my step mum lebih macam say
he also likes to count people's money mm macam dia cakap oh like your sister mm dia nak beli rumah dekat malaysia semua semua semua like berapa ribu lah
lepas tu he like to compare oh kalau your sister kerja dekat singapore the versus your err brother-in-law who's who kerja dekat malaysia dia punya gaji berapa berapa berapa berapa
ya he no the thing is that he wants to count right after you say he will say things like can buy these can buy that sekarang can buy this can buy that and then like somehow right we will see the underlying err meaning macam actually bila kasih I duit macam gitu
like itu yang kasih you marah because the fuck you why the fuck are you counting my money and then secondly you don't even raised me and then after that now you like what the fuck you know I mean the only good thing he has ever done in his life
the house that I'm currently living in now it's the best thing that he is evident lah but that also he cannot pay because he work and on and off right jadi um my step mum yang yang he was refusing to give
because he like calculative say oh you from the kampung you indonesian lah blah blah blah balik kau punya kampung blah blah blah blah blah blah kalau aku tak kahwin kau
like you punya life tak better lah blah blah blah blah
macam gitu sampai sekarang tau dia mungkir macam gitu atau dia punya fikiran kan I tak suka
ya like you know this kind of thing like you count people's money you tak nak you nak duit delivered to you it just doesn't resonate with him so like and my younger brother pun macam I rasa macam dia ikut-ikut macam my bapa tau like dia selalu dia cakap mm
lepas tu me and my eldest sister we're like kau boleh born dalam poor family tapi kalau kau mati miskin itu kau punya problem
allah dah kasih kau banyak avenue untuk cari rezeki untuk bekerja keras kau yang tak bekerja keras kau jangan nak blame orang lain
and like err play computer those kind of shit you know you are privileged eh and he doesn't realize that or acknowledge that jadi I feel like wah kenapa eh like is it because they never live through the life that the four of us live through
tak tak tak I'm just like I'm just stress over my life in the sense where like you know when will the man in my life be useful and wake up you know everyday I fucking see them sleeping in the room watching watching youtube being fucking unproductive even though like my brother is on holiday all that shit right
so macam I don't know man it's like
tapi sector macam mana
I tak boleh I teach drama and english before
ya I've met a few people in my life were like those like oh I'm just contend with sederhana which I cannot relate to
poyo siol
yang you yang you yang you what um apa tu err this this answer thing is it like um it's like a notes for the exam lah
but I would say it's because of err bumiputera but you are a singaporean malay you are not a malaysian malay mm there's a difference
it's cheap what you know but the thing is at like like what I would normally tell people lah like I tell you before right macam kalau you nak beli benda sana kalau you tinggal dekat sana fikir macam orang sana
I keluarkan lima puluh ringgit I bayar dua puluh empat ringgit untuk shampoo is tak memadai it doesn't make sense I'd rather choose a cheaper alternative or like whatever you know
dia tu yang yang itu lah yang err text you yang tanya is you
ah kau memang dasar orang melayu
kau yang babi eh nak orang putih padahal kau hitam babi
sawo matang oh okay
mm kan you punya suara kan macam abang-abang pun
macam apa number one candidate untuk orang kahwin lah
ah you tak bilang
eh tu tak fair because like how can he choose it's supposed to be the choice of the people
ah nanti you you tunjuk I ada gambar
tapi you tapi you
pergi keluar dengan kawan right like another guy right
kita jadi in ah kita jadi in pasal kita use triggered jadi budak kecil
ah tiga minute lah
tapi um I feel that kalau you excel very real like you will be like top top one top five percent maybe they can offer you like uh there are some companies would like sought you out you know then like um give you accommodation and all that and then get you to stay there to work for them
tapi um
okay today good day for you semua okay
location penting but
provided let's say there's no more COVID there's no kan macam we can still go down and like there's a lot of eateries museum
hey okay firstly it is not a sports mall a sports mall is actually dekat novena which is to velocity
right secondly it is a mall for all ages and all people from all walks of life so kalau let's say you're a foodie there's lot of places
to go to let's say you are very hip and you like there's a place for you too and let's say you are you are someone yang macam suka
macam gini ah
I am stating the facts of the funan mall and I am I like that mall I mean you dah pernah pergi dia punya rooftop right and the views from there thanks to me who brought you what do you say about that
aiya ya my one of my friend pun tried to go up there dengan kawan dia juga then macam eh okay
but actually kalau view from the top of parliament is actually lawa juga cuma I think only special people or special circumstances allows you to use the drone macam gitu ke
but wah kalau
your drone kena shoot down seh kalau you fly
mm betul juga
I just read this article um one of the big hotel chains also tak ingat apa nama hotel itu ah so they are offering
ya tak ingat
do you think mothership articles are like legit and kita boleh percaya
hmm macam
what I feel is that the mothership feels like SGAG kind tapi they are more seniors I tak pasti
is this going to be a funny answer ataupun serious answer
okay I'll make a guess mungkin SGAG
well as compared to my point of view macam I follow both SGAG and mothership on their social media so
wow so old fashion macam zaman-zaman dulu bapa bapa
tapi checkers macam
wait dam
oh dam lah okay okay
cause sampai sekarang kan I don't know the difference between dam dengan chess wait chess is the one dengan the horses things right
oh okay dam yang bulat itu yes okay my grandfather pun main dam
ya sometimes I katak bawah tempurung
so uh your grandfather your ada ada the dam
checker board yang dam itu
your family ada
a bit yes macam dulu-dulu pernah lah like you know someone taught me I think my grandparents or
come on this time of night you want to play this kind of games diam please
where were we oh tadi cakap pasal dam
dam is the one yang macam
um there's waves actually alhamdulillah
I tanya pasal apa I tanya pasal dam okay okay
oh jadi yang kotak putih itu is like supposed to be like non-existent
so let's say ada dua player right so I'm player one you're player two so I
put my pieces on the black boxes tapi you put the pieces on the white
okay faham faham
you cannot move back tapi boleh move forward
ya betul itu
nanti you shiok sendiri
come on lah maybe I just I perempuan seh
do you know last I think I dengar pasal mister softee is like
sekarang slurpee jer lah masih ada
or certain um outlets sahaja
eh jangan gitu lah
kita boleh cakap english dengan melayu jer tau okay
oh my god talking about mister softee now I feel like eating ice cream macam mana ini walao
cerita apa ah

spoiled and karat yes

that building that land is is been there for a while lah macam you know
dia dah um refurbish and upgrade is it
um when I was in school macam doing research on like economists and economic crisis
ya when we're younger there was this thing happening macam at that point of time we don't feel it lah obviously cause we too young
to experience it tapi
but I guess it's a silver lining right like you know the way you guys are now anyway so macam more comfortable
ya do they still find it macam alien when you
travel to other parts of singapore macam cause you don't know the place well and stuff cause for example like me kan kalau
I drive up to the east especially for with myself or with myself pula on my own
with my parents et cetera macam it feels very alien
I pergi tempat lain gitu it's not somewhere that I'm comfortable with actually unless macam
no other places in singapore make you feel janggal like out of place except sembawang
macam you make your own decisions and stuffs
levels like what period in time of your life macam you
five years five right lima
no dark past I'm digging out from you you're safe okay tak zilch
also I think ya I think pun like for me I was in poly what so macam we were like what eighteen nineteen right
tapi kan if we were in sec four we were sixteen
you secondary school cuma
no mana boleh hey hello
apa ini okay so it's like one thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen
perk up the spirits perk up the spirits tau jangan macam gini lah
but it ya we didn't kita tak close pun anyways so macam
acquaintance too young to learn the word acquaintance back then tapi that's the fact
actually I didn't have a lot of good memories dekat
at that school also anyway pasal
I only spent two year dekat sana
oh okay I don't even know kalau ada perkataan undeniable entah eh

I'm just looking at the list of things that I made to talk and the top of the list is holidays and what we miss about it that's the first thing that popped out of my mind oh it is don't tell me you tak rindu ke
setuju it's
you literally just nak leave singapore just for the sake of it after all this
rehat and relax at the R&R
no lah come on lah I still remember bila you go you went to malaysia with your family then suddenly last minute

and then macam you guys didn't have clothes additional clothes ke something like that
wait yang
right putri pacific okay okay is it the one yang betul-betul nearby where's where's the woodlands causeway itu
no I mean kalau dia orang buat polls and and surveys confirm will boom cause over there you tak payah bayar
that's the thing about your family sometimes dia orang boleh just do impromptu stuffs
tapi okay lah option one will be plane option two will be car option three will be ferry
and you know I don't really like to drive a lot so kalau you know someone
malas girl you
highway tak err there was one time we went to desaru
ya just drove sikit jer it's just a short distance
legit macam snow and driving is no easy business of the sleepy roads and everything wow
abeh it was
snowing very hard sampai kalau you stop at the traffic light kan there's no one go on um to the front mirror
and then you need to macam every rental car they provide you with a shovelish kind of thing

after a few days pun it's the same it's the same thing
kau pun dah nothing much to do abeh ah like err after a few
weeks tak tak silap aku ada lagi satu engineer engineer ah engineer baru masuk engineer dia engineer baru ni masuk dia sekali pandang kau aku memang tahu lah dia ni engineer dia pun dari india juga ah
pasal the the the funny thing is
masuk site office eh dia duduk kat tempat yang aku duduk yang aku tidur tu
so he literally
took up my my my place ah kirakan dia macam ibarat ganti aku ah
so aku
at first bila dia dia datang like
the first few days dia masuk aku tak berbual dengan dia sangat ah pasal aku tak tahu dia engineer as in aku tahu dia engineer he was part of the company is an
employee of the company tapi aku didn't know his background so hari-hari ah
ah so hari-hari aku datang office aku tengok dia pun dia pun macam aku time baru masuk dia datang office duduk office pun duduk
so aku pun aku tanya dia ah I ah pasal
ah kita attachment semua kita nak kena err put up a report apa kita punya own individual report
so aku
ah aku pun need someone to to to give me some input ah like all these technical technical details apa kita buat apa benda yang bangla bangla
dia orang yang tengah bikin apa benda yang dia orang tengah bikin so I need someone to explain to me ah so aku tahu dia ni engineer he's part of the company tapi dia pun tak ada kerja dia pun macam aku
aku tanya dia lah aku just take the opportunity ah aku tanya excuse me are you an engineer
so that explains a lot lah kenapa dia dia macam aku duduk lepak aje tak sebab dia punya project belum start lagi so that's why the the company
I asked him to to come over to this project first sambil tunggu the his project start lah
so aku
dengar gitu aku like okay ah aku punya mind macam terus ada light bulb ah okay bagus ah aku boleh boleh apa
ah minta tolong dia untuk aku punya report ah individual report ah
terus aku aku korek ah help me tell me what is this explain to me what is that gini semua abeh dia dia bilang ah
abeh after that day onwards pun
err dia dengan aku sekaki ah err err dia pun selalu come let's go let's go out jalan-jalan err pergi keluar jalan-jalan pun ni ah jadi orang tak tak
tak tengok kita tak buat apa-apa ah ah
asal tak tidur dekat sana ada got some certain days certain days we kita ada tidur kat kat ah kat tempat situ kadang-kadang pasal we did an upgrading project in a apa
kadang-kadang pun kita ah apa jalan-jalan dalam sekolah dia kita tidur dalam classroom that was during the holidays lah so the school was empty ah
kirakan err the
dekat site eh
yang paling tinggi is only the project manager lah and project manager that time aku punya project manager perempuan so ah she also
err wasn't the the macam mana nak cakap eh ah
there there are some ladies who are macam rude ah dia orang dia orang can do both the office work and the site work tapi yang that time aku punya internship my project manager she was more of the office type lah
so dia duduk office aje ah kalau higher ups ni semua ah dia orang jarang datang site
at most pun dia orang datang ah apa once err
dia orang pun tak akan dia orang pun tak akan macam err
ya probably they want kalau dia orang pergi site pun nak tengok progress you won't go into
macam dalam-dalam ah dia orang setakat jalan dekat tepi tengok oh okay ini dah siap ini dah bangun ini dah bikin dia orang tak akan masuk like literally masuk
aku so the good thing the the engineer came aku minta dia tolong so like
aku pun help to update my my weekly report
okay lah aku
uh one good thing pun aku pun like have to be smart also lah macam aku pun tahu office orang semua
cakap aku aku datang pun tak buat apa-apa kan so bila bila this engineer dah datang aku dah dapat dia tolong uh aku punya report
so bila-bila aku nak kena bikin report aku buat dalam office ah I mean that's the only place also yang aku boleh buat apa
that's like like that's that's the only setting yang kau boleh buat kerja apa
so ada juga lah there's there's where other engineer pun start to notice ah wah dia ni ada juga ah bikin ni bikin ni buat ni semua pasal like a few weeks later ada lagi satu budak
attachment masuk
ah budak attachment ah
dia pasal kau dah hari-hari datang office pasal it's just like a very ah small ah small office
so hari-hari kau datang office eh kita masuk kita punya site office sebelum masuk kau nak kena buka kasut kau ah
so satu hari tu aku aku macam biasa report late to work
aku sampai office aku tengok kat luar pintu
pasal kau dah hari-hari datang office kau dah kau dah cam ah kau dah cam ah ah
ah ni kasut dia ni ni kasut dia tu
eh hari ni datang ada kasut baru ah ni ada budak attachment baru ke okay ah ada member ah siol aku ingatkan
local poly ke apa ah local student aku dah excited ah at least ada member eh pasal kau hari-hari kerja pun muka muka sama mendak ah
sekali aku buka pintu masuk office buda china ah siol
dia dia err and he he's he's not from a local polytechnic lah he
bukan bukan he's he's a he's he's from china tapi dia punya course is from
err err err apa ni err building construction authority kirakan macam mana nak cakap eh
ah macam
okay ah it's to put it simply macam
ah aku
aku masuk fire fire fighting apa eh
dia orang ada separate course apa fire fighting course eh macam
tapi untuk building building punya sector ah kirakan aku masuk ni course
aku dari poly tapi untuk some students hantar
ah so so okay ah dia so bila aku nampak dia alamak budak china pula eh aku ingatkan pasal kau tahu
at that aku tak tahu lah sekarang still I think now still the same tapi back then
they couldn't speak english well lah and then they they just speak mandarin to you aku pun dah ibarat macam
err apa macam ayam dengan itik ah berbual
so okay lah  aku ingatkan ah okay lah at least ni ada attachment ada budak attachment okay lah
ah err just talk ah pasal
apa everyday pun got nothing much apa so just try to strike up a conversation
err strike a conversation pun like he doesn't really understand what I'm trying to say pun aku pun tak berapa faham
aku pun tahu like he doesn't really get me so okay lah just just
just err or just hi bye gitu ah
but the funny thing was apa ni
dia lagi apa eh err
dia lagi lagi laid back dari aku ah siol
a'ah ah dia lagi lepak dari aku lah siol
dia like literally
bukan nak kata aku like the model student ah aku pun aku pun ada juga ah memang ah aku lepak ah tapi aku pun err you have to be smart ah kau tak boleh
err macam selalu err apa err
tunjuk orang kau you have to balance it out ah
macam aku bukan aku hari-hari pula err datang datang office lambat
ah so aku aku hari ever since office boy dah dah macam cover aku eh office boy dah dah macam
ah dia dah tolong tolong aku aku tiap-tiap hari datang office lambat
pasal aku tahu aku dah tahu dia punya timing bila aku datang office tak ada orang dalam office so selalu aku datang bila tak ada orang dalam office
ah ah tapi when
when it comes to bila kau nak tunjuk muka ah then kau
tunjuk muka ah
ah so you you just have to be smart about it ah tapi yang this this other guy like he literally like
err dia punya suka ah
dia ah
dia dia the good thing untuk aku aku ada orang cover aku the office boy
like you have to make you use you have to network ah you have to network you had to make connections tapi dia ni dia ni tak ada connections langsung ah ah
ah office boy approach tapi language barrier juga ah
apa dia pun in his own world even the the other engineers
the malaysian chinese enigineers pun dia orang pun cakap dia ni
apa dia ni tak boleh ah dia ni buat hal sendiri
apa so so that's that's the thing ah
that was my experience lah for my for my attachment so it was from that experience yang aku tengok
eh siala rabak apa aku tengok the working environment macam it's so stressful aku tengok the the engineer yang dari india tu kiwak muka dah macam zombie
tapi untuk aku ya aku was just a student apa so aku just report to work like the usual like eight thirty to six something like that lah aku macam mana pun
pukul enam aku chao ah pasal they they don't really have have anything much for me apa tapi like those engineers like
dia orang after six pun dia orang still
err ya so abeh aku tengok like the work environment macam
semua orang buat hal sendiri macam not much interaction
like ya it's true err aku can understand they don't take me seriously and aku pun wasn't expecting them to take me seriously ah aku kau cakap gini pun aku teringat ada satu kali tu it was the first tak silap aku the first day ah the first day
aku report to to to aku apa attachment
so kan aku bilang kau apa ni err
everyone was so busy pasal they have a meeting so after that err they all left for the meeting
aku aku seorang aje ah dalam office
aku seorang dalam office sekali alih-alih ada satu orang masuk dalam office
dia pun tengok aku dia tengok aku err tak
tak kenal aku pe macam dia ni siapa siol abeh tanya oh who are you aku cakap attachment student oh attachment student abeh dia tanya aku err singaporean ah ya singaporean
dia dia dengar singaporean terus dia straight talk direct direct punya siol
you singaporean why you take this course singaporean where where want to work in construction one work under the hot sun work under the hot sun ini semua gedebak gedebuk kiwak aku dengar terus down siol serious aku dengar terus down
tapi ah ah tapi ya lah apa that was
I was still young ah you you you didn't really understand it lah tapi bila dah lama kau dah ini kau dah kerja kau dah in the industry eh
so apa ya so
after the experience aku was like siala gini rabak pe err
so err err lepas bila aku tu tu yang aku pun make me
fikir ah I like aku betul like sial ah betul ke nak kerja err construction industry rabak gini
tapi at that at that at that time pun macam abeh kalau aku tak nak kerja construction industry pun aku nak kerja apa sia
abeh aku fikir-fikir abeh aku dah belajar ambil diploma ni pun dah dah dah tiga tahun takkan nak
okay lah cakap dengan diri
aku even though aku
aku still don't know what to do with my life since aku already have this diploma which already err took up three years of my life okay lah I just just might as well take up a job
aku ya aku applied for
which I applied ah ni I applied the stat boards public utilities board ni semua so okay lah alhamdulillah err within one or two weeks they get back to me and aku got the job quite quite fast ah
um ya apa time aku
ya bila aku dapat kerja pun like
pasal like err when I join the company
then they because it's a big company apa so they have this apa induction course ah
it's no longer your your your age age age group ah so you meet all kinds of people lah abeh abeh jumpa abang-abang ni semua apa
oh engkau umur berapa
ah ya ya around your age ah oh muda lagi ni kau punya ni kau punya ah first kerja aku cakap a'ah
oh apa kau patut
err muda-muda patut kerja luar dulu kerja private apa rasa dia punya susah payah dulu err kau dah kau dah tahu dia punya susah payah baru kau masuk
baru kau masuk err
government state board ni semua you know lah because they see government iron rice bowl which is true lah definitely I I won't I won't a dispute that ah
and uh so when they when they say that aku pun like eh
alamak aku pun did I make the right move ke tak eh err err like
you were saying ah kau
a fresh fresh graduate baru baru baru baru graduate ini semua kau patut
err kirakan start from the bottom ah start from scratch
bila aku happy kerja
and aku pun so it it gave me like
err doubts lah aku pun like
did I make the right move ke tak eh
tapi I mean
apa it doesn't really matter also lah
just went along lah abeh macam
aku pun fikir balik like
err ya what he say really err apa like
ah tak bedek ah but
was stuck in my mind for for a few weeks ah abeh aku pun fikir balik macam sial ah aku baru dapat ni kerja abeh takkan aku nak takkan aku nak resign oh just
because aku nak nak nak listen to that guy kan
uh apa uh
I mean apa you
you just made do with what you have ah you just make do with what you have memang betul
apa the the at that at that time my my nature of work
err apa
it didn't turn out quite that bad also pasal
macam you're not sure from a technical point of view you I can always refer to the consultants ah so
abeh err from
from aku punya nature of work pun project management pun what what I
back then pun aku wasn't really a
a a apa ni I'm
I am a very quiet guy lah aku not those person go around talk talk to people I mean I still am
so so ya you aku aku
improve on my soft skills and then dekat err during my course of work pun there like what I told you ah who decided to further my studies take up
like I told you before lah apa aku time ambil degree pun was like
doing a degree I should also do a degree tapi
uh aku was just following the trend ah tapi now now aku fikir balik I shouldn't have do that lah I mean ya I you should still take up a degree but then
and uh what you really want to do ah pasal that time
apa err
since you say it like that pada aku in my opinion it also depends on the industry you are in ah so you are in the what in the arts industry media industry
arts industry ya okay um which I agree lah which a degree is not really ah apa a need ah
when aku did my degree uh
err aku did my degree while while working kan abeh as years go by eh
aku kat kerja aku like
aku tengok aku punya sama ah like
work environment pun
aku tell myself sial ah aku aku aku don't see myself
aku tengok aku punya bosses eh like
macam err
dia orang ada takde pun macam beza sia
like they are just like pasal okay
organisation kan like ya we have a apa like uh
tapi stat board they call it lah
when kau pun pun you should know ah kan hierarchy ah it's like
literally like fucking lot of hierarchy you know like abeh macam
kau kat bawah eh macam
tak boleh buat decision abeh kau nak kena
err lepas kau nak kau nak lepas kau nak kena
abeh orang atas dia pun kadang-kadang nak kena tunggu decision orang atas dia lagi
I mean kadang-kadang politik macam orang atas yang paling atas tak suka
like apa sia ni like
kau orang err kau orang cannot make a decision abeh aku nak kena buat apa siol
bertahun-tahun lepas punya sia
you like even even before even before you join the the organisation or like eh siala kau orang dari dulu eh abeh sampai sekarang
more like pada aku it's not healthy ah abeh abeh macam aku like kat situ eh aku kerja situ like siala macam aku kalau stay sini aku tak nak sia end up macam kau orang ya I mean like some of them they stay they stay because of the money like ya it's true ah aku
dispute it lah apa err government really iron rice bowl lah as in like
but aku just don't see myself doing that long term ah
to to change line ah aku decided to go into aku wanted to do media so
err after my apa ni err my degree ended
aku graduated
aku took out a course dekat mediacorp
at first aku didn't know about it also like as in I I do
ah apa sebelum aku enroll under mediacorp
ya I I did some I did some research ah of courses of media courses ah apa that's where aku like macam aku menyesal lah siala like instead of me doing this degree in project management I should have like straightaway
it's good lah it's good lah uh so aku was like err apa siala aku tahu dulu aku
and then apa that was
this school ah aku dah aku dah lupa ah nama sekolah dia ke something like that it was it is it closed down already ah
ah something like that ah aku pun dah lupa ah
then apa ni so aku just still err
to go ahead with it aku look up ada ada aku aku just look up on google lah of of ah media courses ah abeh aku fikir balik ah macam
aku baru habis aku punya part-time degree aku did my part-time degree for five years
aku dah like that five years eh aku pun like like like macam in a way like macam drag myself to to finish it ah
abeh err
lepas tu aku sekarang nak go into media industry kalau aku nak ambil degree aku nak kena
aku was like siala five years of study dah dah macam dah cukup ah like ah enough of studying ah sia ah enough of studying ah I mean
ah abeh
aku fikir-fikir balik takkan aku nak take up another degree
another three years of degree for media abeh aku just look out aku tengok mediacorp offer offer
this is but it's a diploma ah it's just a one year course okay lah one year aku cakap dengan dia okay lah masih boleh take it lah one year okay lah so I I I I grabbed it ah
then err aku pun
transition into the media industry kan so aku like thought of err maybe err take a gap year first ah before aku joined the media industry
so uh apa aku
was planning to take my gap year which was this year aku uh already plan to go to new zealand
a working holiday if you heard of it ah basically I basically it's it's a holiday tapi ah
kau boleh you can apply for a job there
but ah but it's not it's not like those or full-time jobs lah it's like a temporary jobs like maybe like six month contract jobs ataupun part-time jobs are those kind of jobs ah ya ah so
so err apa ni err
kalau there's an option for you to extend another three months provided you work in their horticulture industry
pasal ah their country they have a demand for the industry and they need they need workers are in the industry kirakan dia orang pun ibarat macam singapore singapore we need demand for the construction industry
so they they make use of this err apa ni err backpackers foreigners to come to to to err holiday
and err at the same time these people need money to continue their holiday apa so they make use of this people to work in the horticulture industry ah so aku
aku dah plan ah aku dah book aku apa flight semua aku dah aku dah err dah dapat dah visa aku dah apa ni err aku dah apply deferment pun untuk aku punya
semua dah settle semua dah swee tinggal nak
nak ni je nak naik flight jer
ya I mean it's it's it's predictable lah apa aku punya kerja pula aku nak kena bagi one month notice so err apa ah
aku decided to like literally ah resign err one month before aku punya flight ah aku tak nak resign too early pasal aku pun need the money lah
I have over there apa
so aku pun decided to like just err retire one month before my flight
aku was seriously like the the suspense eh was like wow like only
apa err
when the news all broke out oh apa COVID
ni semua apa ah
at first macam the whole the whole world were were singing praises for singapore oh singapore have their best system they have the best ini itu ini semua gedebak gedebuk tapi aku dalam hati macam okay lah aku harap that like
err maybe err new zealand they dia orang like closed one eye on singapore because
kononnya singapore have a very good system in controlling the the virus they will still allow err err visitors to come over lah
sekali but unfortunately that
did not happen ah aku punya
ah apa
ah three weeks before my flight ah so at that time when they announced that aku dah already tender my notice aku dah resign pun
ah abeh like fuck man at that time like siala macam damn when when when that news came out eh aku rasa macam like like rasa macam bodoh ah like ah
not really cheated macam
ya ya ya err abeh macam
betul lah I mean
it's not my fault tapi like I really felt stupid at that time ah macam damn like like aku like aku pun dah bilang err aku punya boss semua like aku didn't like literally at my workplace inform all my colleagues oh I'm going new zealand ni semua like macam macam excitingly like break the news to them ah
aku like just keep it to myself lah tapi of course dengan aku punya boss aku nak kena bilang dia apa aku aku nak resign ni semua
abeh boss aku pun of course they they dia orang pun tanya aku kau betul ke nak resign apa ah
at that time pun pernah tanya aku if aku nak reconsider ke tak resignation aku aku cakap tak ah aku still want to go ahead
he respect my decision ah dia cakap okay ah this is your decision I fully respect your decision if you really want to go you just go ahead lah okay lah so when the news broke out that new zealand they close the borders aku like fuck man like siala ah
dah aku dah tender aku punya resignation abeh semua dah dah dah settle flights semua dah settle logistics semua settle
habis sekarang tak jadi eh aku dah then err the the other things that came into my mind ni ah sekarang macam mana takde kerja takde kerja abeh like

K the first movie that we watched was apa eh
err oh no yesterday yesterday night semalam yang kita tengok cerita um what was the title
dia macam the oriental express um
what was it eh situ apa ah sebelum the knives out okay jap before that I just wanted to say about the knives out lah okay
it's kinda okay even though err aku tidur lepas tu but I can somehow see that it's a good movie because it actually sedikit banyak macam the oriental express
it's about uh a person being murdered orang kena bunuh and then macam there's a lot but whereas in the oriental express there were twelve people were being suspect and twelve of them were all the murderers that's why the other that's why it was being stabbed twelve times lah kan
but then in this case dalam the oriental err apa the knives out err dia pasal about err dia punya apa this guy umur dia lapan puluh lima tahun eh dia baru sambut dia punya birthday yang lapan puluh lima tahun lepas tu lah dia kena um dia orang assume dia kena bunuh lah
so after that aku tak tahu apa jadi
but you told me that there was satu orang there's a one suspect right ada satu orang kena suspect so ya
this kind of err story apa err story that story line is is good lah I like ah kind of like ya I'm gonna watch it again later
semalam penat babe
um before that what did we watch eh sebelum tu apa kita tengok
you can't have more than one spell ya because aku rasa because one of them err jatuh hati dengan um dia punya apa classmate dia ya
kawan sekolah dia so dia actually dah buat because there's a bully eh actually this guy is a bully so
ya what they did was um dia orang semua spell a cast on him to turn him into good guy and eventually he did lah tapi sayang ya lepas tu yang the one that fall in love with him actually had another err spell cast on him so lepas tu tahu tahu besok dia dah mati
not so super natural sangat juga it still err ya it's true lah
mm tadi apa lagi kita tengok kita tengok oh the nun we watched the nun
aku rasa cerita conjuring is the best horror movie lah
it's it's kind of err thrilling for me memang ah aku pun penakut tapi
lagi pun tengah COVID kan so macam apa lagi cerita kau pergi tengok
for me aku rasa aku punya favourite movie one of it is err mamma mia
my my ah so it's it's a nice movie lah aku addicted to it lah it's very nice lah
annabelle ya dia kena menang ah
I like the one that you showed me yang cerita unhinged tu oh that one you guys have to watch man
banyak emosi you know emosi tertekan leh aduh that's like ya
betul mm
actually aku tak expect ah
and then when and then when it came to a part whereby she started to horn and then you said that okay this is where you will begin okay then I'm like okay I thought he's gonna be like macam stalk her all the way just focusing on her but no she he actually went way beyond and
apa err attacking the family members and all the stuff
wah that's tu seram eh tu kalau kat singapore aku rasa just err
orang tumbuk-menumbuk punya eh
daripada kena road rage
so lepas tu it falls on a saturday and then his wife was supposed to follow him but then the wife actually got invite invitation to err the wife actually is a bake caterer lah
um she was invited to do catering for her event and she's an artist photographer lah begitu so she owns that a big err art gallery eh so lepas tu
err bila dia kata I ah can't follow he she can't follow him to the reunion for this saturday
and then lepas tu uh the guy actually got um connected back with dia punya ex-girlfriend ex-girlfriend back in the college and then the ex-girlfriend also texted him saying that um my husband is not coming then
err I think this guy tak nak ada any connection ah so he just you know
okay I just say this guy A lah eh I forgot the name so this guy A dah pergi dekat reunion dia so he saw his ex-girlfriend
and then it came to a point where the girl the ex-girlfriend actually keep on macam harassing him in a way like kasi uh gambar yang dia tengah pakai sexy lah yang dia tengah apa err ah seducing in a way so two months later
err what what was there sekali dia nampak apa gambar-gambar dia macam nampak gambar familiar kat gallery dia gambar-gambar dia is
all the pictures of him having sex with the ex tapi gambar tak tunjuk
so the picture dia punya face wasn't shown lah so he suspects suspected dia like that maybe this his girlfriend of his is err you know revenging him back tapi tak tahu pasal apa
sampai masanya the woman at the err wife get to know that you know um
so lepas tu dah habis he err the wife somehow got kidnapped
he actually got a try to find for his wife and then he actually stream live dekat dia punya ah social media when he got caught up with dia punya friend bila dia dah kidnap dia punya wife
yang ah this this this district attorney person dia put
sudah dapat tahu and then um
so ya she was she was ni ah she was ah
because he was this close to finding out who actually was behind all this thing and she was pang she was dead
yes so kalau within five minutes dia tak tak bagus tak best
kau lupakan sahaja lah don't try to convince us in watching now

ya ya nasi ambeng
actually it's sedap lah quite quite err nice lah
dia ada consists of uh ayam lemak apa ayam lemak cili padi begedil paru sayur tomato carrot sambal goreng ya it's quite nice lah
so we have been covering ourselves with blankets selimut selimut ya so
so pergi oh yesterday we went to um
where did we go botanical garden but we didn't get to hike banyak sangat pasal hujan hujan dia macam stop lepas tu hujan stop lepas tu adakalanya lepas tu hujan lebat so macam kita tak dapat nak err
habiskan kita punya hiking lah macam selama ni kita habiskan dalam kita will always habiskan dalam ten kilometre twelve kilometres tapi kita tak dapat buat semalam
aku pun macam ya what if lah macam kau tak fikir ke macam kalau komodo tu macam jump dekat kau tiba-tiba ke tahu macam crocodile
macam dia tengah senyap-senyap lepas tu bila lepas tu you know how tall crocodile are right so like macam when they were
it's like macam siala kalau manusia it's like apa
five people tall like that macam gitu ya
and then kita akan dapat news seorang kanak-kanak berumur
dimakan oleh sebuah eh seekor buaya
aku eh aku tak berapa takut sangat lah dengan crocodile semua ah
ah itu lah kalau dia jump kita elak kita elak kita ikut macam P ramlee boleh settle
ramai juga semalam eh yang berumur-berumur jalan-jalan semua
I think pulau ubin not so bad macritchie is like wah kaki aku sakit eh
dia punya jalan dia is so narrow that aku
ya when I went back island wow my leg kasi pain
it's like aku tengah jalan K depan and she was at the back and then there was this noise like you know if monkey were fighting K if you don't know how monkey fight or how it sounds like you go and YouTube it okay so it was a very loud noise and she actually just take her hand and just pull my neck like
a'ah seh it's like boleh gigit engkau sampai cedera parah oh kau tahu tak
monyet business
the older one is like macam
dia macam sign kau ah dia kata jangan bilang dia jangan bilang dia
ah pasal kau dah pekik nama aku
next kalau ada next word coming from your mouth he's going to come at you
takde air because okay that time eh bila aku pergi bali kan then lepas tu they have these tourist place whereby kau boleh beli kau boleh beli banana and it's like the kecil-kecil banana in a bunch
for like two dollars so lepas tu kau boleh feed the banana the banana pulak kau boleh feed
kau boleh feed the monkeys there lah and there were a lot of monkeys there where tapi kat situ ada rangers lah
there's this one monkey aku rasa maybe dia macam hmm primary school monkey
dia tak besar dia tak kecil ah he's not an adult he's not a child so probably maybe it's like err teenager so this monkey actually came to me and then he just snatch this banana from me so lepas tu I think the banana was rotten
so dia buka he peel peel peel peel
I was shocked I was like eh ini biadap eh like I paid because it was so I was so err interested I mean I was so having I was so much having fun
so I kept buying the bananas like up to ten dollars dah so kau imagine ya aku beli two dollar two dollar two dollar so I kept buying and then I buy lepas tu
aku dah kasi kat semua monyet and the monkeys will be like macam dia tak ada datang kat engkau macam simpati punya macam kucing takde eh dia tak nak engkau turun dia jump on you and jump on your head or your body there's like three monkeys four monkeys on me
wanted that banana so I gave it ya gave it gave it gave it then after that satu tonyoh kepala aku okay like after he ate the banana he actually just like
so err aku takut ah aku tak marah lah kalau aku marah dia sekali dia bawa the gang ah mana tahu dia faham bahasa aku so
so bila so that time bila aku tengah jalan-jalan then there's this one ang moh ada this orang putih mat salleh lah dia
I think she was trying to play with the monkey but the rangers suruh kita dah kita masuk kita semua orang masuk dia dah cakap don't try to be funny lah kalau ada
uh grab your banana grab banana lah kalau dia um you know you don't like macam main-main dengan dia lah so aku rasa this orang putih main-main dengan dia so he actually wanted to bite her ears
aku rasa dia angry ah or aggressive ah because dia main-main the rangers tu dah kata jangan main-main so so he actually wanted to bite the ears ah so dah macam just
not really that deep bite lah sort of one bite so the ah the caucasian girl was at shock ah dia pekik and in the ranger was like I think they had this macam
kayu ke apa aku tak tahu ah I don't know what's that lah so he just like macam whack it so that the monkey will go away
aku tak tahu ah that is that is because they are rangers they know their monkeys aiyo
ah tahu tak apa ah nanti dia panggil dia punya gang lagi ah tak payah lah terima kasih sudah
aku rather deal with one monkey than a lot of monkeys
okay maybe ostrich farm is one another one is yang dekat mana eh
I mean they they don't really macam
they don't really macam
um ya malaysia ostrich aku rasa I felt regretful that we didn't get to feed the kangaroo when we were in australia
I have holidays in november and december right so you know I always have this macam
so aku just want to ask like do you prefer to work at home or do you prefer to go to your physical workplace
so ya that's that's that's our life lah eh kita hopefully things get better hopefully things um
okay lah I don't like that you know we take things we take life for granted we thought that you know you could travel as much as we can we could go out as much as we can you know but when this kind of thing happen we will like macam
alamak tak boleh buat tu tak boleh buat ni
we can't get to travel as much we can't um and then when we now we used to have like gathering kita ada gathering we used to like just book chalet and invite you know like what twenty thirty forty people and then birthday celebration
we will invite people over but now is like macam
orang lagi banyak yang hush hush you know coming in to celebrate birthday and all those stuff
aku rasa vendor pun kesian juga lah it's like you know all these err thing macam numbers restricted numbers and all those stuff that is coming from the government right so when pengantin dah buat bayaran for certain for certain pax eh
and then the pengantin okay lah kalau aku pun aku pun rasa macam I just wasted my money you know like few thousand dollars and then now the numbers is like that so and then vendors pun
kesian juga lah like macam aku dia also want to earn a living you see so there was a point whereby there's err apa err miscommunication between the pengantin and vendor like asking for refund and all those stuff like even vendor also didn't know that this thing will happen
and it wasn't even in the contract so some of them that I heard is like blaming the vendor you know of not giving me back tak highlight dengan duit lah you know and those stuff but
aku rasa it's it has it has to be um
communicate both face sekali lah
like pengantin pun tak expect numbers will drop vendor pun tak expect numbers will drop so you know it's only fair that vendor err apa err maybe gantikan dengan something or the pengantin kurangkan something so that you know both will be happy about it lah
ya pasar basah ya
mengeteh lah kopi lah so
I think just old old songs or cerita-cerita lama ya atau pun err they will go to me watch and you know err um buka daripada handphone apps then buka YouTube ah apa
I also err apa tu download err yang apps untuk watch movie ya so wherever he can scroll he scroll ya

lepas tu dia tak ada clapping
dia macam err conjuring ah dia main clapping dekat dalam almari macam gitu ah jadi
so dia macam ya dia macam gitu ah sekejap dengar sekejap dia tak dengar so aku tak tahu apa masalahnya masalahnya ke dengan apps ke dengan err recording ke aku tak tahu apa masalah dia lah
dia suruh bual dia suruh bual like daily dia suruh berbual just macam daily macam kita berbual so sekarang ni kita bual macam daily ah macam berbual K jadi aku tak tahu kalau kita terlebih melayu atau pun kita terlebih orang putih aku tak tahu jadi
aku tak tahu aku dah tanya macam mana I justify tapi tak ada jawapan so dia kata bual macam biasa kau bual lah macam biasa sekarang

alamak uh lynn sekarang tengah kerja kat catering kitchen ah buat kerja part time tapi kalau you nak kerja uh I boleh ajak you kerja lah awak nak tak
alamak kesian
kena the hijab then later got stains all those germs mah so maybe they might be concerned with that but then I think they can always uh how to say they can prepare like a modified version of the hijab such that it not only helps to protect the muslim nurses but it also allows them to do their job right I think that is one way that they can do and I know that recently they have been talking about that
but you make a promise what to meet her at two like I mean if you are going to be late you can always inform her lah like I'm going to be late so you can macam meet later or you can meet schedule another date ke apa then this one he make her wait
oh no wonder lah you keep messaging me want to go matchmaking cause you want to avoid that situation then I was like thinking why this girl always nak cari boyfriend lah cari husband then I'm like want to go matchmaking together I a bit segan lah
I know what you can do you can go to the mosque and find any imam and then say abang tolong saya
oh my god I feel I feel so weird right now you have so many interesting experiences with people who like you I don't have much but I think I have one story lah it was during my project so um my diploma we collaborated with like engineering students so we have to do like auditing at uh low income households kat yishun ah not really at yishun it's like canberra yishun area so um we were having a briefing and then I was like
and then he said uh can we exchange numbers cause you know for the uh final year project I was like okay lah I mean he's not like the main committee but I was like okay lah why not maybe at least can update him and stuff then after that from then right he keep messaging me on telegram on whatsapp and then during that period right uh what is that movie ah marvel is it not star wars apa movie tu yang viral
oh henry henry punya lagu
but do you still use that same email tak kan
actually I also like him actually he quite handsome remember that time you know you know but it doesn't mean that I like him okay remember that time in secondary school we were sitting like you were sitting in front of me then you sit beside justin then I was with rayson ingat tak
I think out of all the people you know right like how much I love to use SIRI every like every err err everything that we want to search on google I'm always hey SIRI and dorang tak faham like dorang selalu macam give me some weird err weird like response
I macam malas nak taip okay so SIRI suppose to be the convenient option right it's suppose to be more convenient it's suppose to bring more convenience to your life tapi it's like double job ah I I I don't mind it honestly I don't mind it tapi you you yang selalu macam
for their day to day like everything is SIRI seh because I think they have like like google home or like alexa right those I think those ones are a bit more receptive a bit more macam how do I say like err they can do more commands maybe but for SIRI macam everything tak boleh
kita just tak kaya lah kita tak kaya
ya so if my phone can actually macam faham what I'm saying from time to time it would be nice lah I would I would appreciate it a lot lah
ah okay okay let's think of a scenario okay maybe raya raya kita pergi rumah dorang
okay salam hey selamat hari raya selamat hari raya
oh I makcik I I yang makcik eh wah okay
okay okay you makcik you makcik
you pakcik okay okay you pakcik you pakcik okay
okay okay kita buka eh hello selamat hari raya
baik dari rumah pak ngah punya
tak okay okay jer okay oh sejuk sangat
oh okay lah so pakcik tu akan cakap err hey SIRI make it hotter
kan yes it like that always happens like what's the point lah honestly I tak tahu lah what
I hope dorang macam it's it doesn't become like one of those err you know the movie her
like okay okay so the this guy eh okay I kind of forgot what he does or whatever but the essence of the story is that he err macam fell in love with the so macam because the became dia punya kawan like the only companion that he had or not maybe not only companion but the one that he feels paling faham like paling understanding
something like that like so dia macam
very err macam
existential crisis kind of thing macam oh no what's going to happen to me whatever whatever so ya that's kind of cool
it is kind of cool lah actually macam
it in this recording he said that tak tak dengar
I cuma dengar
no okay let's not let's be good citizens but anyway macam ah I think it's a good thing what he did only because like he made use make good use of the time you know of a bad situation he made it into a good one and
um like you macam lupa life before COVID mana concert err err indoor stadium ada
err you know what's weird like err I've been to concerts dekat big box and I feel ya
err err don't know but I think it's like the third or fourth level something like that and then dia macam um it's like a big
no but maybe maybe different concerts different but I think I've been to two concerts there and both the concerts is err like standing and I think it's weird because macam
kind of like JEM you know westgate like all the the malls there tapi macam to have a concert like the the the artist from wherever they are flying from they will be travelling
to jurong so they will feel like you know like I I guess you get the real or like you get a sense of like err a bit more macam authentic singapore but
like weird lah to have a concert there cause it's like sebelah dia is like furniture shop you know the furniture shop tempat makan I guess macam what
it's like you ya you have to buat research dulu ah like you cannot straightaway
is it in the the food court or is it like macam like tempat makan on its own
oh oh like I I probably have been to that food court and the food court that okay the the stall that I love so much dekat sana is
the naan oh my god the indian food dia punya naan is I think two dollar fifty and sedap gila and like the dia punya ah butter chicken macam tak tak ah lokek super sedap
I know macam dengar you punya mulut macam berair liur macam you know
not for more than just satu occasion ya
oh okay pasal like it's every macam not say it's everywhere it's like it's not just one specific place where all kurtas are it's like everything is everywhere ya I get it
and mahal gila like kita pula dia
oh murahnya you shouldn't gotten that one
okay kedai apa because I pernah makan dekat tekka punya market and there's a certain stall yang sedap also like it's not bad
is it dekat entrance you know there's the bus stop
I menang seh
ya so I macam very competitive
and like macam you know like like it's time I win something or more among your friends
or actually not had to win that game is like whatever opportunity I I boleh I akan menang lah but it was it was fun I love I love hanging out with your friends
mm like honestly same to me macam I'm not really surrounded with people yang
really play a lot of board games at home or my own friends they don't really do that but I feel like ever since I met your friends dorang like are really
I don't know maybe if it's in their nature yang dorang not the most err not say friendly not the most social macam
ya but not a lot like I it only I think only this year then I learn how to play monopoly betul-betul ya err before that I tak tahu sangat macam mana nak main monopoly deal also I tak tahu main
this is the thing okay the only thing I played eh a board games macam betul-betulnya board games macam meaning you are the board macam not card games or whatever first okay kita just board games was the game of life
I I think masih ada kat rumah but I have to find it
okay everyone will start at a point where okay kau nak belajar ke kau nak
ah start kerja straight it's literally like this it's literally life decisions ah that will make you ponder about what to do next tapi dia macam fast forward gila ah sebab after maybe a few turns you dah graduate lah err then for those yang macam dah start kerja after a few turns towards the ending you dah ada anak you know you dah get married you dah ada anak so it's like it's very fast tapi it's quite fun err so that's the game of life
no I've never played that also when I was young so snake and ladders was only because your friends you know macam introduced me to board games and shit oops sorry err introduced me to board games eh I wanted to ah bring that board games to
officially like official game rules I don't know how to play like to me macam snake naik atas ke turun I don't know ah ladders boleh turun ke naik atas you know like I don't know which one is which err I don't know proper dice rules also macam err you know like if you um)(ppo get the same ya exactly or snake and ladders I think cuma ada satu dice satu die so so you get six you can go another turn that kind of thing ya like I don't know I don't know so it was that was the first time also I played with my friends um but before that so there was the game of life when I was younger
dia macam aeroplane eh ya I I ingat and I think I rasa I rasa I pernah main juga but I tak pernah
like research how to main betul-betul ya
like kita lend or macam like kita will put into groups and play I don't know but pick up sticks was one of my favourites also like I love to play that game
it's the one yang you cannot move the thing right
whatever it is okay lah some people will think strategically dorang nak amek the one with the highest points some people are like just take as much as you can and accumulate all the points
so but whatever it is okay it will start with how to explain it eh all the sticks in one hand okay and only one person does this dah one hand and then dorang just lepaskan that's it
I think is I think as many I don't know lah but like only one person have to do that and then dia lepaskan kan so it's like everywhere right scattered ya so like each person just have to take one by one lah
ya which is okay tapi sometimes even the one at the top can tergoyangkan yang the other one
okay I tahu about that ball I don't know what you do with that ball like macam is it supposed to be a throwing game or what but yes I do remember that paper ball yes
for a moment I macam
in my whole life I tak pernah cakap tu dekat siapa-siapa so kenapa I cakap tu dekat you I tak tahu main chapteh no err I I think I'm pretty bad at chapteh err for people who can play what's that called yang the sepak takraw I salute like cause it's kind of similar right you pakai kaki like flick the thing up like I think sepak takraw is harder than football or soccer ya so I ya I really really salute people who can play sepak takraw
I I I think it's better if you play it and also this recording is going to be vet by other people I tak tahu kalau the rules betul ke tak completely tapi basically like ah I I really want to play with you like this game so maybe I think we should get but okay congkak gives me this memory from primary school okay so primary school ya let's go way back in primary school
kita ada this one corner
macam kampung-kampung eh like but okay
err with the steps as well like it was like err I don't know how to explain ah okay paint wall right to look like the house right and there's like a platform with the steps to make it look like you tengah naik atas the ya to the to the macam what's that call like a patio luar the kampung like outside part of the house
okay ya the serambi and then like you know okay so over there they will like not say cabinets ah like shelves of games you can play so congkak was one of them
like something similar right okay lah dah tak special
so oh that one also macam macam eraser
err I never played but there was a point where like I would have a few of the country punya flags ah
oh ya it's always like the hardest to find eh singapore err but I never had singapore punya flag
oh wow apa tu it's like a what subscription box of erasers you don't know what you're going to get but each month you get or each week you pay
um and hopefully it will happen lah but till then macam it's not my biggest priority as of this moment because I feel like you know I want to be at a macam okay there are different goals that I want to achieve in life and right now that's not like what I want to achieve at this point
mm cause I think err macam uh in any company in any business there's going to be a loss you know but I feel like if I lose now it's too much of a loss ya so I want to be a bit more comfortable first and then
no like err macam I understand this is a goal that I want in the future
but if I want to push that goal forward I cannot do it now like I don't think I can ya ya maybe macam the planning lah planning maybe boleh
but macam kalau I nak buat sekarang execute everything sekarang I don't think I can yet
or your you know like you whatever it is you can still sell or whatever or you can still find the next big thing the next idea like but it's on you lah someone can have the same product but they cannot sell as good as you for example you know so I'm not too worried I do I do understand that macam kita dah discuss the idea we really love it we we think that you know this could be something
um tutorials to her starting vlogs to then her macam err buka her own ah no no not buka ah she collab with major makeup companies
so that's like the starting right like the first step is like collabs right and then after doing the collabs and she actually collaborated dengan this satu sunglasses company
ah like she gave birth to both her babies but ocean ya it's very nice but err that's not my macam
a household name like okay like macam everyone knew fenty as like her name fenty rihanna robyn
such a global phenomenon macam and it's because kan like she had the okay business is business you get money money is whatever you know like that's the goal of any business to make money to make profits right tapi the way she did it eh because she started with the makeup and the makeup brand the way she did it was
inclusivity was diversity was macam err
macam maybe you know there are certain shades that doesn't match her or certain um products that are not the most friendliest to macam that kind of skin tone
was probably like years in the making as well it's just that starting with that as the first business macam like it really
as the main thing that I'm doing in my life macam I dah tak payah kerja dekat office I
dah macam my family is taking care of
like all those kind of worries dah tak ada and all I can focus on is my business
but it's more of a personal thing it's not macam the company success you know maybe the company success is to get returns macam to get return customers maybe that's one way of like um success but for me is a personal thing when it comes to my own business is that ah
hundred K you nak tahu tak kenapa I tanya tu sebab kat instagram I wish I wish tak lah but okay actually
it's not a scam like I I I'm very particular when it comes to like the things that we see online right but so instagram there's this account and I'm still trying to understand actually so kalau you boleh faham you boleh try to explain to me ah so there's this account that is called curated business curated businesses okay that's the handle how I found out about this was kendall eh kylie jenner posted a post of her with luxury bags saying you can win this plus seventy K
and if it comes from kylie jenner it has to be like you know legit right so okay so the steps were that you have to follow curated business and scott disick scott disick is the the ah kourtney kardashian punya
okay so you have to follow and it was like seventy plus accounts seventy five I think so you you have to follow all of those and then just comment like like err the question was who are you going to share this seventy K with so all you had to do was um answer in the comments section who and just follow the businesses which I think it's a way to increase kan like real people you see it's not bought followers it's like real people punya accounts tapi the moment the giveaway is done orang akan unfollow ah
but it's just that like kalau orang tu terlupa then maybe the account is still there
okay so lepas ni semua orang so seventy K plus like all the bags tau plus tau it's like and it's open internationally so like I wanted to see how legit it is again they have winners from different parts of the world they have from japan they have from mexico they have from
so it's like it's cool lah macam you menang you menang you tak menang you tak menang ah so I ask you that because I macam if I really menang what am I going to do like
it's one of those things where you won't know until it actually happens you know or like you can think about it but will it happen this kind of thing so macam and some the person who won was from
I don't know I think it's the states ah florida or something it's not me ah they they said the results on friday I checked tak ada notification ya but ya like so um
I I think singapore quite mahal lah like
because the bags were different sizes macam there are some like the smaller ones there are like bigger like
okay seorang wanita yang suka
oh okay bag bag beg-beg apa what's like the
and then there was a point whenever I tweeted something macam my mum works at coach gitu ah then someone indirected me and said coach is the bossini giordano of luxury brands so that's when I macam okay I got to humble down but no but basically like um I haven't heard lah ya we're not representing it's just experiences personal
okay but anyway ya so I ni tak pernah masuk macam
sebab orang-orang dekat dalam macam sombong sikit</malay>[ah and very judgemental
err I don't know man I don't know dia punya price list seh like I think satu handbag eh
I tak tahu like
empat ribu probably gets you the small zip hmm probably the small one small bag
maybe I don't know I tak tahu I tak pernah so
just macam whether or not you'll be mm
I tak ingat sangat tapi
cause okay the only reason why I betuk-betul tahu there's a difference is that remember there's a comedy that we watched the the one the err the doctor from
no no cause macam the people who listening to this probably dorang biol like you know
ya ya ya ya exactly so the the the doctor punya salutation that's given it's not medical
I understand macam it's not something kita um
like something we want ah basically not something we want for ourselves it is understandable kalau like you tak tahu the only reason I tahu is because of that comedy and I work in a business school like that it kalau I don't I don't know mm
apa kita tahu is just main game
ya kita nak main monopoly after this actually
sorry kita curse banyak seh
tapi I trust you lah don't worry about that oh
okay err in order to be my friend you don't have to laugh at everything I say it's just that macam that is a plus point lah
err kentang the way I say it kentang goreng kentang kentang kentang okay like the question shouldn't be what do I like eating it should be what do you not like eating cause like I can eat anything else except for these foods so it's like
I don't like beef unfortunately sebab to me macam a bit
in terms of food but we'll why because kalau dah nak keluar makan
ya but I've I've never said guys I don't eat beef can we not go here like I've never said that because that's very rare that a tempat will only sell that and there's nothing for me ya
ya like steak house probably still has like ya ayam err ikan semua okay err so ya I think it's still pretty okay
just that andes andes sedap gila and
ya okay so I'm pretty sure everyone thinks it's called andes but kita actually dengar waiter cakap andes so
so macam usually if I go through anything that's not
so it like macam it reduces that err
that is not a good thing also jangan berhutang-hutang orang
tetapi err what I think you're asking is more like
will they be down for you like will they be there for you and macam really support you in times of need yes
macam mm there's pros and cons you know having a friend like that I feel like
orh oh I'm sorry baru entah baru balik dari ni tadi baru balik dari clinic
err so far okay jer macam better better
ya it's better it's way better but sometimes I do have my chest pain macam sakit dada like sometimes dia very hard to breathe you know
but the doctor then gave me um apa inhaler
ya so inhaler okay lah pakai okay jer
when whenever I have that pain but now for now no lah takde pun
I asked my friend yang ada asthma and then I was like wait jap I actually post a status dekat Whatsapp
err ya that and then I forgot that my my close friend ada asthma then I quickly Whatsapp her and then dia cakap uh ah dia explain lah one by one and then I oof lega better but the chest pain is still there you know cuma macam tak dia masih boleh bernafas clearly lah ah
mm mm ya macam very hard ya allah serious

okay sama
ah ha ye
the one yang macam yang rambut lebat very
oh ye ke
mesti best kan ada baby
dia makan fruits dia very healthy bagus ah
comel lah very cute
wait you talking about cat kan uh aku buka tingkap bilik aku tadi
orh I'm okay ah tapi lately rabak ah because uh apa ni COVID kan so I cannot work so most of the time I stay at home then I just watch Netflix
atau just uh watch new dramas lah basically
correct correct then the one that I regret the most sekarang is uh apa ni the one that you invited me to watch ah demon slayer
for me personally right ah uh aku bukan a fan of apa ni macam cute cute uh type of err art style for the err anime for me I prefer like macam semi realistic so the ones I watch is like initial D but when I watch demon slayer on myself
I regret gila serious because it's like uh the storyline bagus and then like dia punya action scenes also was quite good and then I was really blown away ah so like aw shit I semi regret seriously I should have started earlier cause by the time I started right uh it was
that's why but err but err adding on to yang the older punya animes even initial D pun kan it started in nineteen ninety five it didn't reach that much so like so like the fact that it's brand new then macam it got so much hype and like so much um err attention right it just blows my mind ah ya and I really thought it's it's really nice lah and
not gonna lie ah it's very rare um for this kind of err shows or like this kind of anime to make me cry so got one time too I almost cried cause ah the part yang
err I think is the one yang the second episode yang dia pergi bunuh the very big demon then he touch the head
uh ya the the the one who killed the punya kawan
yes yes yes correct correct then the other one that affected me was um the apa moon that got strip of his uh power pasal dia tak uh eat enough humans the one who use the drums ah
ya uh I felt him cause when he was a human right he wanted to be a writer or something right then tak ada orang appreciate dia so like I can feel because I I also taking english myself so like I felt really
uh terkesan like I was like shocked lah when I cried a bit I was like eh tak pernah pernah macam gini the last time I cried was like err what endgame
kompang kompang gitu
err tapi tapi stress ah yang err dia punya battle tu the other one that err was more stressful was the punya the he was using the spider web or something that was quite scary
sekali a one time slash then mati
that's why tak fair gila serious
ya ya even the intro dia punya what they call it opening I don't know opening ah the opening was also quite macam blood pumping ah for me personally but the one that hit me the most like for me personally eh for you is the music kan for me is the ah story line itself
um uh give them a proper farewell or like a form of respect macam dia tak just bunuh cause oh you're a demon cause err he take the time to like understand them look back ah look through their memories and then like say like eh you used to be human lah so it's not your fault you became a demon so that that part is I think the
I I kind of uh apa ni regret a bit right apart from um not catching up to demon slayer earlier on is that err to be honest but previously I was quite judgemental of anime ah like macam I look macam ah sometimes look at the art style macam very cutesy cutesy dia macam takda substance to it ah but then when I take the time to analyse right actually some animes are good it's not everytime macam those like uh act cute atau macam very cringe cosplay cause let's be honest there there are cringey cosplayers and all that but some of the animes are really damn good so aku macam semi regret so for me personally ah for demon slayer right I started on naruto
um ah I know it's one of the best animes but draggy gila it's too draggy for me but I'm just gonna take the time to like watch ah but waiting for season two demon slayer then like you said you recommend also ah the day before pasal one piece so that one will try so I start naruto first and then one piece but I don't know which one is longer naruto or one piece ah actually
and then ya then but the good thing about anime is like each episode it's twenty minutes lah so it's not too not too macam mundane I guess
ya especially like the those korean dramas ya tapi are these sorry is this the format for err anime like each episode got twenty minutes atau
oh kira macam movie is it
ya the atmosphere won't be there the mood confirm hilang ya
because speaking of this music and setting atmosphere right I think you also got do like music editing right for your game before ya ya in in school cause you're taking ni kan sekarang ah apa ni uh I don't know if the name is still correct is correct me if I'm wrong
ya I see your math semalam jer dah tak boleh tahan that's why I I don't take math
correct correct yang semalam you show me the pasal apa tu row operation that one obviously I try ah but I really I really don't understand lah but the first few question I understand lah ya
ah something like that ya ya but sorry my math tak bagus sangat
because your friends always around you but I will say uni like really force you to be it is either you ah force you to be independent is one thing then like if you really try it yourself tak faham then you have to like uh you know push far and ask around cause if not right you are stuck ya that's what I felt juga
yeah I guess macam uh if like you if you like tanya then like you didn't try then think macam people think that you don't put in the effort that kind of thing then they will start to like have that kind of judgement so like that that that's the that's the dilemma I have also but most of the time I guess it it's our duty to try first and then like really kalau macam we are stuck there right then we just have to ask around if not really gone
ya but the the good thing about uh your course is that uh at least you know some of the people there already like some are before some are for me personally rabak gila ah ah I take english but then like err if even when I try my own right I really cannot do it so like most of the time I ask my lecturers a lot of question in fact I also got ask you some questions about my assignment juga
ya ya cause mak kau cikgu ya ya ya that's why it's it's true ah like I I always thought I had the mindset like boleh buat sendiri boleh buat sendiri just belajar jer just but then like eventually you're stuck then when you realise that you got different opinions right after you try right then at least you ah they call it um crystallisation of your thinking like make your uh ah word flow much more uh smoother ah in a way at least you can understand from different sides
ya eh tak tak I I saw in my study guide apa crystallise your thinking or something like it's not crystallisation uh like um basically they encourage macam um making study groups and all that cause for me like uh like you err yourself ah aku pun introvert that time um when I want to try ask macam malu-malu cause I feel paiseh ah like macam
oh kira macam the vibe is it like you can feel the vibe ah
in a way ah in the same time at the same time from what you explain macam is to juggle the perasaan of the people right ya ya you like you have to be careful cause
um some um I think it's very rare lah that there are people who are very macam clear cut direct cause most of the time people try to jaga hati and try to be more mindful what they say
as very um ruthless or very blunt lah macam later like even though the approach you have are valid I think the person will feel macam very um
ah that's why that's why rasa kecil hati kirakan ya
ah then when they continue doing that then they don't learn kan they don't go then like they keep having that mindset and attitude right then when they grow up right then will like realise asal semua orang keep attacking them ya that's the number one thing that's one thing I had to learn myself cause for me masa dulu I was very sensitive so now I try to macam balance out lah
ya can I share one story ya okay pasal I'm guilty of this so err so err err err the the one thing that err you mentioned about time management there is it for me kan honestly speaking ah
balance and all that so I admit ah sometimes I'm guilty of like not having that time management so I didn't have that much time to study so um before I made the decision to like sit out these two exams right like I uh consulted err my partner and my mother then they said that is fine lah then I think about it macam tak affect my grade cause there was a time before what I failed my exam then my uh drop rabak gila then lepas tu um
I have to rebuild it slowly so I thought about it like um if I can just resit for exam might as well take next semester and just err restudy lah and the good thing ah about my school now is that since COVID right uh they allow us to aid they're going to waive off the resit fee cause by right uh you have to pay the fee tau it's not free resitting the paper I think it's hundred dollars for mine for mine that time but now it's free lah cause of COVID so like I'll just do it lah but even though with these factors in place and I still feel guilty macam I feel so bad macam kirakan I can clear the mod one then macam I'm just dragging but when I think about it I'd rather take this than risk my again uh cause uh the last time I checked if I fail again kan
aku boleh tendang sekolah lah like fully ah I err I think that's the requirement for my school first is academic warning letter then after that is err academic termination then you have to it's as if err after you kena terminated it's as if you have to err re-enrolled lah to the school so that's the downside lah so I'm like ah I don't wanna take the risk ah I don't mind dragging but my still maintain
for one semester is like below two point eight straight away kena that kind of
ah ah that's what I kena ya that's why I'm like very scared now so like my now I'm slowly repairing so like it's in like in the mid twos ah if I'm being honest so like I think about it ah takpe lah just resit ah
I don't want to risk it ya sakit sia hati that time ya
uh are there but how there are different so that um when you speak a certain language right and someone is speaking a certain language they you don't understand each other then like how if you're speaking variety or dialect of it right you you understand so for example english your singapore english and malaysian english right you can understand but if I'm talking english eh I'm if I'm speaking english and kau cakap macam ah there are structures to it that make it different ah I think it's ah sorry if I pronounce wrongly mutual intelligibility or something like ya between languages ah
ya something like that lah like they have a uh a grammar structure specific for that language and a grammar structure specific for this language ya so we just study the differences ah ya so that's why they say we cannot understand different languages ah if like you use uh malay then I use english in like I really don't understand malay you don't understand english then like susah
it's a translation but then like err one word is before the other or one word is after the other so that's the that's the thing and it's very complicated to explain cause like for me when I see the like if you want to really analyse right like you there's a lot of different structures and then like err the placement of the words and all that so that's the difficult part ah ya I think there was once I I look err the one that my prof taught me was err apa ni
professor ya sorry err professor ah eh ah so casual panggil prof uh she talk about english in uh do I call it france or french french french sorry sorry sorry sorry france is the country ya allah eh sorry sorry err so basically um
pejabat office right
ah pejabat pos so it's like it's reverse ah so that's the different thing
ya I don't know cause usually my course is english in psychology but then now they rebrand it ah so is english language and literature so like you have to take a minor in that so like if let's say you take minor english language and literature with communications for example so like so panjang right so like ah tau boleh takpe lah just let it go but I also don't understand why they suddenly uh change it like that like um they just make it english language and literature like um why they don't have the presets cause last time uh when I first enrolled it was english with psychology english sociology something like that ya then like when I saw that um
ya tak comfortable
correct ya cause nanti err it will be natural
for you to start comparing with others tau then nanti macam okay for example you got a posh you nampak orang ni ada Ferrari then you see ah people got um apa Burgundy Burgundy Honda then later you get Burgundy Honda later you got Ducati it never ends tau so like when you keep buying more things like this you think like um err you're making yourself happy cause you are getting everything you want since you are a kid what tapi what you're doing right is you are sort of uh
apa ni putting all your happiness right into this materialistic stuff then eventually it just wear on you
unfortunately he died already ah it's iron man games of thrones tak game of thrones tak that uh one prime uh character in the Marvel uh
uh adding to your part macam uh when you're someone normal and you don't have any powers you eventually uh apa ni
belief and then like ah actually um it's not technically a superpower lah but it's more of like it's err apa tu
keep up that that's the that's the ironic thing eh cause I just realised this now I'm having this uh eh epiphany macam if you notice eh in endgame
uh black widow and iron man tak ada power tau but because of them right they save the entire universe you think about it because black widow sacrifice herself for the soul stone then uh iron man dia uh take the apa tu uh gauntlet from err thanos so like that part was already scaring me cause when he snapped right I thought it they really ah all the efforts for nothing but then like err he managed to get all the infinity stones on his uh hand then he just snap ah so it takes a lot of um courage to do that you know so like it was is is really um mind blowing to think that the two people who saved the universe didn't have that much powers they're just normal human beings with like one has a
ya macam that day jer this is the type of body that you want on the beach oh my goodness
ah dah kurus ya ya
dan cause also um
like it's even more um ah amplified lah I guess lagi lagi malu lah kirakan
tak boleh ah some do play some do play not going to lie tapi um
ya sebab but it's more suited for the mature audience ah
eh tak lari eh topic lari that's why
okay okay takpe takpe go jer
kat mars
dia pergi eh
atau Grab express uh deliver parcel
young ah wah that's a good thing eh like we can remain forever or like we can eliminate any apa tu
ya ya orh then err it'll be relatable to uh demon slayer when uh in the movie uh what's his name eh ah correct me if I'm wrong ah asaka ke akaza akaza he wanted to offer uh rengoku to be a a demon what ya so but he says the beauty of it is that humans die ah so
um if you remain at technically if you get to live forever atau you um remain here forever like you lose the beauty in it uh like if the circle of life doesn't go full circle
but probably why ah sorry I keep relating to demon slayer cause it's quite relatable ah err probably why the apa six demon didn't uh
nama saya nadi
enam tahun whoa
ada contract
jadi sudah sudah tujuh eh enam tahun
dah enam tahun wow
lagi satu tahun tengok lah macam mana
ya betul betul betul
mengidam eh
pasal pasal kita orang duduk tunggu makanan or the bunny chow tak tahu apa akan datang tiba-tiba it's a whole loaf of bread
ya ya and it was recommended ramai orang suruh order
ah cara dorang cakap dengan kita orang macam kawan gitu so kita orang saja lah tanya-tanya eh apa-apa yang sedap tak pernah try ini semua
terus err
apa nama dia pekerja dia suruh try bunny chow terus ada satu customer pun suruh kita orang try bunny chow
terus kita orang try ah ya ingat tak the customer
terus wah it it was the best decision we've ever made
ya kita nak makan banyak kira you know pros and cons kena give give in ya oof
that was quite nice ya the burger cause before that sebelum tu kita orang try ah McDonald's
then saja saja
saja nak try tengok country apa negara lain macam mana dorang punya ah McDonald's
tapi tak tak sedap sangat lah singapore punya standard terlalu tinggi saya rasa
a'ah I I boleh boleh rasa yang ini
ah ye ye ye ye ye
jadi kita orang saja tengok apa apa ni plus kita pun orang melayu terus dengar kat sana ada ada community melayu juga
uh jadi kita ingatkan
walaupun err the history is different we thought we should at least try the food
makanan mesti ada mesti ada ah sedikit ah yang sama kan
oh okay I remember ada samosa
ye ke lupa ah oh okay interesting I forgot my memory not good
dah dah dua dua tahun eh
err practise in different ways and then ya I think I think it was it was apa eh
oh oh I remembered inside it was a whole thing like inside there was fries and then there was there was daging and there was cheese it was
it was oh it was basically like roti john but they throw in uh fries also so ya and sayur also so it was like a whole meal with a
dengan ya I remember just taking one bite and felt like I just finished lunch
ya dalam lima minit tiba-tiba makanan dia dah sejuk kan
a'ah tak boleh taruk tepi pun kan
mmhmm pasal ice box<malay>dia ice box dia share nanti takut orang curi kan ya
lepas tu we also didn't want to throw I remember
oh wow tu semua pahadal dah lupa seh now all the memories are like coming back
eat like they didn't have much to eat jadi apa dorang buat is apa-apa dorang boleh dapat all the ingredients bahan-bahan dorang ambil taruk dalam roti terus makan jer
sedap but it was like a it was an experience lah it was really just all at once ya
gila weren't didn't think properly lah basically
mmhmm okay juga
kita orang tak tak bersedia at all ya
terus macam kita orang tengok atas kalau kita tengok atas tengok macam puncak dia masih tak sampai-sampai ah masih jauh lagi dalam hati ke
a'ah lepas tu oh yang yang saya masih ingat is a
on the way up ada satu orang orang ni tengah lari tengah buat morning exercise dia dia tengah bersukan lari naik turun gunung
jadi kita orang fikir eh ni ni agaknya masih masih
masih okay lah agaknya akan sampai lah siapa yang lari naik turun gunung eh
jadi kita orang ah tak jauh mesti tak jauh terus ingat dia ada anjing sekali ikut dia
saya ingat saya fikir dalam hati okay mesti dekat mesti dekat jadi continue naik ke atas continue naik
ah ada tempat duduk
ah dah naik a'ah
dua jam mak ah
ah eh tapi masa dia punya dia punya apa
ah permandangan cantik lepas tu
pun it was a it was quite cold I remember cause it was winter ya so it was
a'ah tu tu lah tu lah
but the end near the ocean was quite windy so everytime we reach the hot side we were just jalan macam biasa saja-saja lepak sikit
terus sampai ke tempat yang terlalu sejuk tu tiba-tiba ah angin dia kuat tu tiba-tiba kita orang terus lari lari lari eh
a'ah memang orang yang nak naik dorang pakai baju apa mountain gear tu semua ada yang stick panjang tu ah hiking stick dorang tengok kita macam apa pasal apa budak-budak ni kita orang saja jer jalan pakai pakai beg beg sekolah gitu
and we just rest and reflect apa kita orang buat tadi
but I really want to go back just to see signal hill see like ah tak puas cause like
cause I was really curious I actually tengok ah video signal hill macam mana terus nampak tempat dia macam permandangan semua cantik ada apa orang duduk atas atas grass semua okay like I never said I didn't regret that experience it's just I really want to go signal hill next time
I got I got jio one friend she she also malay okay we all melayu together
lepas tu we could have like walk down almost tour you know
ah gi jalan-jalan
uh uh I remember uh ada makan makanan macam fish and chips
that time kau rasa
like aku masih ingat like for for the trip was mostly the experience and I feel like the
the activities dengan kawan-kawan pasal ah I ingat dalam kita orang naik van lepas tu ada tiga van ada tiga van four is it ah ada empat van dalam satu van ada dalam tujuh atau sepuluh orang
gitu going through puberty
dengan ya kita orang dengan a few other singaporeans right I remember
ah dorang gaduh
ah kita orang walaupun ah
aku ingat ada berapa orang dalam van tak suka budak ni tapi walaupun kita tak suka kita masih baik kita orang tak tak ada dengki ke apa kita cuma
so we we sort of came to consensus that we kita orang akan bersama dalam berapa
trip tu berapa hari ye
ya one week kita orang came up with a consensus we will be together for one week so we should we should get along so even we don't like this boy we try to we try to you know make this
ya he also seem to enjoy it and I know he's aware that a lot of people don't like him lah jadi macam kesian sikit juga lah
okay lah dia minta gambar tak apa
hantar jer
okay to be fair budak tu kalau kita orang kalau kita punya kayak sebelah dia dia akan
dia akan tolak atau dia akan splash water ah lepas tu
ah I ingat that ah I have a fear of uh the sea
so that was not helpful whenever he tolak my my kayak
macam mana nak lukis just bukan lukis saja-saja tau macam lukis macam macam artist gitu
macam boleh dapat kerja like macam graphic design ah
okay pasal adik saya seorang artist jadi hari-hari saya di rumah saya boleh nampak yang
macam uh swimming
at this bridge bridge dia is a made of wood is a wooden bridge but naturally a wooden bridge can be a bit creaky
the um tahun lalu I went to krabi dengan kawan krabi okay
like I will be responsible for that jadi jadi I remember after that I
like dah dah bangun dah dua tiga jam pergi balik to the beach check up on her she still sun tanning down there
tak no it was it was it was already like
and I remember I was very fascinated by the fishes pasal dia punya air air dia clear kan
banana boat ada tu ada lah but
free do whatever and then they give us a map and they were like usually people circle here but ya do whatever you want just come back at this time and we we really just we tried to circle but but eventually I remember we went okay the thing is kita orang dua bukan orang kayak
and then I remember okay mula-mula there were like a few there were a few family members okay so we started out with a group then eventually they went a certain way and then we just split and I I didn't care lah too much about that cause we we already had a plan cause me and my friend we thought we gonna circle like and halfway through
there's certain places you can kayak right kalau kita orang nak kita orang boleh bayar lah but anyway gi kayak dekat
ah tahu tapi kawan-kawan I semua suka benda gini jadi dorang kata kat marina barrage ada kat lakeside pun padahal ada
ya I I actually uh baru belajar macam mana nak float masa kat krabi because err
I suruh ya I suruh kawan saya ah ajar macam untuk sorry lah eh vishu teach me how to swim then she tell me I teach you how to float
good enough okay jaga diri sendiri
so before we go out on the mountain trip she already told me ah nadirah jangan lupa bawa apa bawa gula-gula ke apa pasal
kalau tak nanti ah nanti penat pengsan kau dah lah selalu pengsan kau jangan
ya bawa gula bawa apa protein bar ke apa
I'm like aww tak aku tak bawa
aku terus lupa cause naturally
on the way up cause okay naik naik gunung tu dalam dua hari
dua hari kita orang kita orang naik atas lepas tu ah
kita orang ada bayar guide lah untuk bawa kita orang ke atas
lepas tu dorang ada ah ada tempat-tempat tidur
macam this small kind of chalet there was even campfire kind of thing
jadi memang dorang betul-betul betul jaga kan kita orang lah dua hari naik turun naik eh naik ada
kadang-kadang ada hujan juga pasal time tu macam june june daerah kita orang daerah southeast asia kan monsoon season kan ah ah terus ada kadang-kadang hujan pun kena stop apa semua and then I remember there were certain point where
ya then she did that but then I remember macam the whole trip she was like I told you to bring
ah dari bawah naik tapi masa kita orang
like lima belas twenty
it's like if you there you see the statue is like besar gila so the only thing that came to my head is how did they bring all these stones up
ya I don't know I just find it interesting lah but ya lah then I remember after the trip we basically we kita orang tour from the north
the city dalam satu dua hari naik bas terus pergi negeri lagi satu macam gitu and just get moving down down down all the way to ho chi minh kind of thing
no lah no me and vishu are cool okay it's just that people people who are not friends with us will find it weird cause we really like talk to one another very kasar like but we are actually damn cool with one another like we understand one another and our boundaries and whatnot and then ah after that err
ya and then I remember halfway through it was just me and her lah ya and then when it was me I know it was more chill cause like initially when there was four people I have nothing against them lah but agaknya pasal tak tak kenal jadi
naturally when I go with a group I feel like everyone should have a good experience so I always like ask oh kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa then I figure out what is the best thing to do but then there was one girl who always had a lot of issues
then everybody like cause okay firstly it wasn't supposed the whole trip bukan holiday holiday tau the whole trip was supposed to be a backpacking trip so naturally there are limitations in terms of the place we stay and you know ah like you cannot be too luxurious lah dia macam too suspicious
that kind of thing terus aku ajar naik motor cause aku boleh naik motor kan terus dia kata ah tapi ah kalau orang catch kita orang tak ada license macam mana terus aku macam
siapa nak catch kau sia
ya aku realised just okay siapa nak catch kau kalau kau rasa kau takut sangat kau naik belakang aku lah apa-apa jadi aku ada license then I was like apa sia kau takut banyak
sana punya orang punya license pun a'ah dorangnya license pun questionable kan
lepas tu macam nak try makanan makanan dia kalau macam suara dia lain sikit dia pun takut dia macam macam like some of the food were were like crocodile meat ya
like eh ah oh terus pasal dia punya kakak pernah datang vietnam jadi dia based her own experience dari situ dia kata kakak I kata macam gini gini gini tapi masalah dia kakak dia satu orang kalau dia bilang aku yang dia survey seratus orang boleh lah aku aku dengar aku dengar apa dia kata tapi kakak dia kan satu orang
dia bukan cabut dia macam okay
a'ah plan dia memang until that time jadi ah pasal ada dua budak ni satu lelaki lelaki tu chill aku dengan dia kita orang jadi good friends terus habis tu ah dia halfway through kena pergi laos
untuk internship
ah kita kena fikir
kita orang kena calculate you know kat depan tu
a'ah tu lah dorang tak payah dorang tengok dorang okay tak payah tak payah aku macam apa ni apa tengah terjadi tapi dengar jer ikut jer ya
aku ikut asalkan duit aku tak tak tak buang lepas tu ah jadi budak lelaki tu kena pergi laos untuk internship
and then lagi satu perempuan tu ah yang masalah sikit dia padahal free tapi pasal dia tahu dia tahu yang aku dengan kawan aku memang kawan mungkin dia tahu dia err visitor sorry dia pun sebelum kita orang pergi sana lah dia dah decide yang okay
since budak lelaki ni akan pergi dulu aku pun akan pergi ah jadi jadi macam gitu lah
ah tak payah lama-lama lah okay lah that was that was a good experience I made a friend and I in the trip which is the boy and then the other girl I completely cut ties afterwards ya tak payah there's no reason anyway then ya I I learnt that apparently a lot of people in that class find it difficult to get along with her lah ya
ya banyak tempat
boleh lah dalam masa depan
main balik ah
yang ayam punya rank
hero lama
aku main more to majors tho so
so I'm still embarrass if people ask me for my rank and not to mention aku punya
one of those really premium skin that no one can get and truth to be told aku actually spend
like at least for me kan aku kena baca all the builds dulu tau dengan tengok video semua before aku main
kalau rank
rank siang my chicken rank
where people think like kita semua
player baru but
aku join lah
cause like if you fight from afar then siapa yang nak fight dekat depan tiada orang
oh ya wait I actually I can actually be a tank I remember I would do when kita lolita dengan apa ah
like lolita dengan siapa
um but aku nak try fighter juga ah
ya ya it's the freya it's the fighter and they did dia orang macam revamp freya right but because macam tiada orang like no one really hear nor really plays freya that much so
actually itu aku smash buttons jer bro aku tak tahu apa aku buat kadang-kadang pun aku tak tahu aku tak baca skill pun
aku just smash smash
tak tahu macam mana menang tapi menang lah then like
hmm so the skin pretty lah but the skill not there ah itu itu I think kau main dengan aku punya freya aku think kau pun boleh menang eighteen senang gila
the rank so I think aku just
I also can like ideate do some research on freya sikit jer bukan macam full blast macam aku punya vexana semua yet if you hear my vexana right
menang menang menang all the way and zero deaths bro zero deaths
um tak payah fikir tak payar fikir sangat lah some more vexana is like slow kind
so macam easy target gitu macam macam dia orang walking ducks then kau hunt dengan rifle then it's hunting season lah bro so like
shoot shoot jer tapi aku mage so ya aku shoot shoot gini lembat gila tapi target masih kena
okay I will I will stay stagnant I'm so long I'm having fun I'm flowing I'm good I'm gucci and I will I will rank I also want to challenge myself if it's I always play low rank then easy kill hunting season fun dia macam
merapek it's like one of those weak
majors but kalau kau tahu main then dia lah tapi kalau kau tak tahu main
then ramai orang panggil kau
apa ah jessie is bad which is not good that's why I left the sixty dollars game
aurora is lembab
dia tahu golek golek jer
vexana burns um dia punya target semua tapi like aurora
macam step lawa jer shiny shiny macam dia setakat over then I dengar eh tak nak nanyi let it go
to jer dia tahu
fighter what is this dragon apa ini dragon rider
eh dia jadi dragon ini bukan jadi dragon rider
entah lah apa lah aku tak pernah nampak character itu ini lah what's in the league
I think kalau ada background music untuk aku punya balmond kan nanti bila dia buat yang ulti itu dengar quack
but okay lor balmond aku think
no okay why aku choose balmond kan because when my sister um she just started playing so you have new characters to play
so aku
okay at least kau sedar diri then boleh lah
kau jangan step jadi tank yu zhong ke apa dragon orang semua ingat kau nak dragon up ke dragon tales
dia macam hype sekarang
ah dia orang dia orang revamp hilda and like really give her
so korang semua recall kan this hilda sneaky dia dekat dalam bush and she's just recovering health consistently
kau tahu kau dalam bush kan then you press this one skill later your speed laju
nanti kau zoom dengan hilda dengan dia punya muscle muscle dia
itu yang aku suka macam kau dah terperanjat like kalau ada music background ah nanti dengar
you save one million coin then you get bonus is it mana ada spend ah
simpan pun buat apa ini apa saving account
were to put a real term on hilda it's like all of a sudden kan kau tengah buat kerja
then all of a sudden ada one train railway rail suddenly all of a sudden right a railway underneath appear under your feet then suddenly one train coming towards you then obviously you at the railway how to run right ah semua kan dah ada tempat protector semua
so dah lah habis lah
a working furnace where he just burn like he's burning himself to furnace constant consistently then bila mana dia habis kan then
you burn your health then macam like you the tank so like people already burning down your health then kau imagine kau dah tiada mana then kau pun burn down
dah double edged sword lah itu
lost world itu
where as hilda is like okay retreat then you go to the bush then you work out work out and exercise minum protein semua
but I need to practise hilda I so so scared dia orang pun debuff hilda eh cause it's like legit a lot of players are playing hilda
he's such an undervalued hero being played in low rank then when you go meet ranks suddenly dia orang ban macam tak make sense lah
no lah ah ya it doesn't make sense but besides uranus dia orang ban siapa like basic gusion
oh cause did not admit cause dia orang tak baca dia orang tak tahu baca dia orang suka smash smash button abeh
entah masuk meeting macam mana itu kidding lah
nak buat apa dengan kita punya container tank itu eh
so nak plan macam mana
kita check in abeh tidur
I think I uh I ask him afterwards kita berbual lain lah but then

err no merepek lah but six hundred is expensive mahal
mana ada momok it's it's padang what
no it's gonna be operational in jan but leceh because it's malaysia so they're err authorities approval system is all bloody slow it's
like I think you really I don't know lah whether you need to like but then malaysia boleh so everything boleh you just need to have money
the younger ones ah macam the the the kids that are in tertiary education I think there's some of them they still lepak lepak and like
no ada what remember during the circuit breaker the the the
the expat yang is it the group of expat pergi robertson quay
the whole of singapore was watching what like kalau like kalau dorang didn't get send back home eh actually dorang tak kena hantar balik kan
exactly that's why this people expats all rich what boleh bayar
but then again right it's quite bodoh because you think about it ah kita tak boleh gathered in more than five people right but we have offices and
we will see actually I'm used to the mask already in fact I'm glad because if you have breakouts right the mask cover so nobody boleh nampak
yup my cheeks are like oh my god it's like rabak
but then cannot do anything but it's okay lah the mask will cover so uh tutup jer muka and the trick is pakai nice eye makeup so the mata nice like lawa the
I think you shouldn't spoil market when you talk to people right you shouldn't be too empathetic because um nanti orang perasan
no orang akan perasan and orang akan rasa macam eh dia ni caring eh this person boleh dengar aku
no you cannot do this because all these mamat belok ni semua macam um
dorang is it bebal dorang bebal so
and also kalau even kalau macam um oh is that a challenge ya they're going to purposely try like ons you were trying to challenge me right I'm going to see no you cannot do that all this mamat-mamat especially malaysia you must think like the typical melayu
actually I don't get it macam it's only in games mah like you can talk ah but macam why would they make it like you're obligated like why why you must why obligated to reply you at like you supposedly free time
what is favourite buaya
bodoh lah oh my god he
what bila dia nak tidur then he play game and sayang sayang people
tak dia bini bini nanti kalau bini bangun dengar is it bini dia tahu
bodoh lah it's just like cari pasal
husbands game so much ah biar pe tak kasi attention lah tu lah ni lah
interest lor or like um like like their own free time ah you cannot just macam oh aku nak main game tapi kau kena make time for aku macam all that shit lah I don't know
while playing game how is the kid going to be concentrating bapa dia tengah main game
why cannot main game kat rumah
there's bodoh it's just like
ah ya lah dekat kita punya void deck bawah block like the the kind that government makes
dia duduk tepi road untuk main game
macam dekat park or like the estate
just to main game until really late
but then dia main kat keluar dia pakai data
apa tu err is it some flu vaccine thingy the normal one ah
it's only sakit because it's not like
ah I don't want tak nak takut
asal okay now I scared tak nak is uh is wait
no I went to the toilet what then you were telling the story then emilio also said something then I didn't really hear apa
no tapi apa tu kan is like err isn't it like penetration unless they put their whole fist inside then then
exactly so why would you bleed if it's only tangan
I think maybe they should try to lube people when they do pap smear jadi dia lube
tak nak lah give up
nanti aku takut lah like what the fuck oh my god alah now I'm like oh my god oh my god oh my god I'm gonna be like so worried
pekik or not huh
ah okay my tolerance for pain is teruk so I'm like okay now I'm like err oh my god
then I think the the thing about orang-orang yang first time kita semua bela sotong you know right
tak ambil epidural ke
oh the contraction before dia sakit
nak so macam pergi pergi appointment first time semua macam apa tu
err pregnancy first err blur blur pergi appointment husband pun blur blur
pasal awkward
ya nasib kentang pergi clinic seorang orang husband tak nak ikut
I told you what we had this conversation yesterday kan I say kan some husband check-up macam tak nak lah geli lah takut lah nak tengok lah tu lah ni lah tapi semua nak bila nak ambil semua nak
got lubang any lubang also can
everything lubang just lubang
at least the mum ikut I think it like kalau kena
you eavesdrop dengar apa jer
as in budak tu nampak dah pregnant tu tengah oh
tapi the youngest yang aku nampak
she's turning twenty one next year habis anak dia turn seven and I'm guessing tak habis school lah right
unless err defer sekolah atau pergi sekolah until like you're thirty eight thirty
no you can differ what macam skip school for ya lah macam lepas beranak she can pergi sekolah then mak dia jaga lah
fourteen what the hell kau beranak fourteen empat belas tahun empat belas tahun you know it's like teenage pregnancy I usually think right kau beranak like oh my god kau beranak at like enam belas tahun or like maybe uh enam belas tahun onwards kau beranak is still considered teenage mum
kau beranak at empat belas it's like dude I haven't even get my menses I was I was waiting for my menses
err maybe their pull out game rabak lembap atau uh atau err because oral contraceptive kena bayar condom condom actually is the cheapest option already
you bodoh lah just bodoh
eh but then again there are people on or like even the tubal ligation then tiba-tiba mengandung
no sometimes it's quite uh quite err oh ya after the menstrual cycle entah lah tak tahu
and then ya is people all this whatever lah I will I will clap for you if you give birth at like fourteen that's like tak gagak sia
why would you why would you do that tapi kan she signed on to army so is like
empat belas tahun catch no ball with a son to look after
the sperm stay inside bodoh it's like
because when they do sex education we are asian dorang tak nak cakap oh korang tak boleh ada sex with like condom but kids are not stupid they're watching porn eh eight or nine years old
huh but all kids have phone now what you know even if they don't know how to search right you know sometimes like let's say you know like you watch show habis ada pop up
okay so after that the third year engkau move out because with your aunty and then
ya but is it your own your own punya feeling or memang they are the one who gave you hints
tapi when you go back that time uh like it within that three years you and your mum you guys on okay terms or you guys don't talk at all or what
ya ya but you and her now dah okay lah
I think she has learnt to accept and agree to disagree lah you know why bro I I whatever you told me here right I can actually relate but mine didn't happen at a late stage in my life lah mine happened earlier ya like for example okay I was such a nerdy boy lah you know my two elder brothers were the naughty ones you know drop out before they completed secondary school kind ya but I was the one who was always the studious one so but okay my my my nakal my naughtiness is not like my brothers they are very active in terms of you know they they they skip school lah they get into they they start to steal from shop lah that kind of things my naughty was my mouth I like to I don't like to lose an argument ah so aku suka jawab jer you know so you know so my you know so as I grow older you know teenage teenage years is when you feel like you're already an adult you feel like you know what you doing so my ego kind of got in the way with my mum lah you know so there was a time that I even ran away for two weeks you know but that was my teenage days and then of course lah you know teenage and it became a pattern it became a habit like you lah you know you ended up becoming a fight often ah but for our case is not religious matters lah for me I think it's just I think it's just my mum's it's stuck in a is stuck in a psyche lah because she was a single mother for awhile
ah so she had to support three kids and two of them was extremely naughty she always have to and you know she's she has to play the father role ya so macam ah ya ya so I can understand her stress ah she was the old school hard knocks kind lah you know tunes you whack you left right centre you know like the kind lah if you go at your cousin's house right she just give you a stare you know you go back you die already you know that kind of fierceness lah so for me as I grow older I guess she also aged you know and um I think she kind of toned down a bit but she completely tone down only after I started to live alone
ah when I was like twenty one twenty one twenty two err I stayed at uh you know those government rental house ya I I stayed uh using uh someone's name lah ya because that person had was sick so she uh the nenek like vacated the house and I thought there was nobody so I stayed there for good one year plus lah ya but they wanted to hold the house because she still wants to go back after she recovers ya so for about one year plus I live separately but I mean I told my mum nicely lah I say I think I want my own space and it's it's closer for me to go to work cause that time I was part time bouncer and like my work is around the central area uh my my house was at outram there the old school jalan kukoh lah you know ya ya so when I stayed apart everytime I come back things got better ah
I think this is what they mean by distance makes the heart grow fonder right you know when you was you start to appreciate each other more of course she was unhappy you know because we were fighting a lot lah and then after that okay and then regarding the house I know what you mean by overstayed your welcome because okay uh when when I was in my early twenties kita actually nak pindah kita nak pindah rumah so by right we already moved to yishun way back already tau but then err this err it's a it's a chinese family lah so initially they're supposed to move out of their house while we move it so it's the fault of our agent because why did she go and confirm sell our house before we confirm get that house so what happen between that family was the mother got a dispute with the son so when the son move out the mother doesn't want to move out anymore
so we are stuck with no house ah so I had to stay for almost two years and my uncle's house like my whole family about like six seven of us we stay in one room lah my my uncle that my cousin give out his room for us lah but you can feel lah after awhile that they I mean they never fight they are very nice to us but you can feel like the energy is no longer like they can if some form of like rimas if I don't know if that's the right word ya so ya but they are nice about it ya so I totally can relate lah then after that I move to for five years so I realise that the same like you lah the over the overcome I mean the overstay welcome thing and the second thing also the fact that the more I'm distant with my mum the more we get along when I whenever I come back to see her
ya so like now when I come back due to COVID for the past six months right we never fight lah like we we we very cordial very civil ya ya ya like we really accepted and sometimes in fact last time wherever she met it will trigger a nerve tau but now no you know whenever she nag I'll just look at her alah she's aging already and then I will just tease her I'm like kenapa ni marah-marah tak penat ke you know
passionate ah kira defensive ah
the the title might be crude but the content is very good bro ya it teaches you about okay like for example right in in in like one day you only have so much F's to give you know there's only so much energy you can impose on so it's about what do you channel you your energy like which one which one which one you should matter more like for example they give an example lah uh you know like how sometimes people um okay like let's say you you you go inside a building there's a security guard sometimes you know some security guard can be very relax some very nya one the nya one ah actually they have a you should empathise with them you know they might look like as if their petty or whatever but it's because they they feel like that's the only time they can feel important they can feel like they have authority because throughout their life probably they never get that so they tend to super imposed on it that's why some people I don't know like for me I work in hotel line before ah wah sometimes when people in the level of managerial position ah are sometimes very guai lan you know bro dia orang
ya lah but no lah I truly mean it empathise lah kau jangan ketawa now you make me feel bad for laughing
eh but dude I thought all this while memang you were actually very motivated to be a pilot what no I mean like I I didn't know that I actually helped to contribute even a bit I didn't know I thought you were always like constantly motivated like you know this is the only thing that you want
so okay so what what how's your journey okay can you share your journey about macam mana kau jadi pilot or how you you let what from the beginning how did it all begin like not not when you were a kid tau not the interest tau the part where you start to casually start to enter become a pilot
oo sayangnya
eh no lah because new house you say you use mah you don't have to cash contribute what ada how much
eh but your setback like really like what I what what I like to say you know nasib kentang eh like like first okay lah the eyesight is a challenge okay never mind overcome already hernia is a challenge twice and then that hernia affected your flying and then after that when you were to fly the COVID pula happen like wow
your nasib is so kentang lah dude
nasib kau sangat kentang bro I don't know why I say kentang ah but I feel like it sounds right nasib kau kentang
another ujian
by then if if still got another factor by then I think I visit you at asylum already your always pretending to fly and then I'll go to salihin ni edwin jadi nyanyuk ready for take off and then the nurse come stewardess are you ready to fly
and then you have friends over there orang yang dalam asylum they will actually entertain you they will sit behind you siol lah funny sia
siol ah kau
it's the attitude of the top ten per cent people you know or not like they they never say die attitude you know I I realise like most of us okay I remember one story lah I don't know if I've ever told you this before there was a legendary pianist ah so she's like a old lady lah you know so she was having a final performance and then this young teenage girl like very early teenage lah like went to her got the backstage pass and said like you know one day I want to grow up and be just like you and then she literally just this old lady like she literally just macam smile casually and just said you know you're not the first person to have said that everybody say they wanna be like me but when it comes to putting in the hours that I put it nobody is willing to do as much you know which is true you know everyone wants to be reached but nobody is willing to fail you know
ya but that's about it bro eventually the one making the decision you can voice out ten thousand and one things like for example look at the the black lives issued right how many people get shot dead but what what actions have been taken nothing what you know so eventually it doesn't matter the only difference is you got more room to voice out that's it because if you go to like china you will say something wrong you kena arrest you go to saudi arabia you insult the king you kena arrest then tortured that kind of thing you know but democracy they just don't have that but ultimately the system underlying thing it's the same thing lah as you if your leader is shitty as a nation you gonna be shitty which is why I I respect the new zealand parliament right now even canada is also not too bad as as as on the surface as what I see lah
if you want to die if you wanna retire old can you know when you're old you go there and I'm half new zealand mah so aku anytime can just like you know eh
he's a new zealander but sekarang he stay in australia
no it's not about mahal bro even if it's not mahal you tell me how much does it cost to get a land to develop your own house to have the rooms that that you want to have entertainment already no
no yes no bro like I said yes but you have to understand macam mana if you want to bring the entertainment to you okay for example lah like my dream is to have like maybe a a big house over there you know and and um I have my own gym my own like like you cinematic rule you know of course ya but right now you ask me I can't even afford the flight ticket to go there bro
not true you see that's something people don't know it's not true no bro because no no bro that's the thing it's a misconception people don't understand bankruptcy okay let me tell you the most the most popular stigma that people think about bankruptcy okay they will say oh my house will kena tarik they will say oh I cannot get a job and then they will say I cannot travel and then they will say I cannot apply credit card back okay let me give you a check okay so bankruptcy does not affect your house if it's
the only reason how they can tarik your house if you never pay for your house that means your never never cut anymore you cannot service your monthly loan then the the can take away your house but banks cannot bro no other companies in on earth can actually pull your away unless
ya but you know so so first statement okay is a misconception people say your house kena tarik not true okay number two uh you you cannot travel okay if you see at ministry of law website they will say travel restriction okay you see if you understand how bankruptcy work let's say you apply bankruptcy uh I give you one one scenario lah one of one of this person oh like hundred over thousand so he got bankruptcy but bankruptcy you still have to pay over five years a certain small amount lah so like in this guy case is about three hundred a month
because your will still cut mah bulan-bulan for the house ah okay so so normally when people go through bankruptcy that that monthly payment if they pay they can still travel they just need to write in to their official assignee the one attached to their case they write in key in the details and whatever not they have to just submit their case and you just be able to travel bro these other things where okay I tell you ah bro you do not be surprised if somebody apply bankruptcy driving a lamborghini bro
bankruptcy they will for five to nine years lah depending on the amount that you have to pay err so for those who still maintain their monthly payment they can still travel but there are people who owe such a large amount that their monthly bankruptcy is still high probably thousand thousand plus a month so that one right they are the people like ah fuck it lah I don't want to pay aku tak nak bayar kau nak buat apa kau buat ah so if they never pay then they cannot travel
but it's not like so long in advance pun you know it's just like a day probably you know ah but the thing is people thought oh cannot that kind of thing
okay so two per cent of nine thousand seven it will tambah balik one nine four so you only end up paying one zero six per month so you will take four years eight months to clear ten thousand if you can only pay three hundred this is the best case scenario lah so imagine if people who owe forty fifty thousand okay lah let's say you you a newly married couple lah okay you you buy a house interior renovation design courts all this one time you spend can thirty forty fifty thousand already every month you must pay thousand plus two loans mah
okay already but it's not one hour not yet not yet a few more minutes okay okay habis kan another thing kan macam the second way let's say macam the minimum eh some people easily already every month must service this much so they cannot afford some because why they don't you don't forget if they got baby they got expenses the susu pampers all these things you know so your expenses might be a lot and your disposable income probably to three hundred only how you gonna pay this is when suddenly debt collector come lah lawyer letter come lah
so all these things we will educate our clients K what happens when debt collector chase you what happens when lawyer letter arrive when should you panic when should you not panic ah this is my the job of the debt solution centre we educate them on the law so the third option is when you need help you go you go mendaki you go see lah they will refer you to this place called credit counselling singapore no no no no is formed by the union of banks all the banks got together people thought it's a government body but it's not so why do they pushed this first even if you go or whatever because the economical structure of every country bro the biggest tax contributors are the banks so if people pay the banks the more they can tax the banks the more money goes to the country so it's better for the country lah ah so ah normally they have their debt consolidation plan lah that debt management program lah all these thing lah this is by the by the banks lah of course they still have interest okay the fourth way is the last resort which is avoid avoiding of bankruptcy through debt repayment scheme so that repayment scheme there's criteria lah you know you are eh aku rasa dah habis ah bro okay lah five second we count down you have anymore second bro okay okay done ah okay
it became forty minutes what the hell and then I like sesat sia I was like so I was so stressed I scared simon angry cause I make I always make him wait
like what if he marah at me and he doesn't want to hang out with us anymore
uh he's kinda mad at me about that like merajuk he merajuk he kata
like cause during the weekends err weekdays tak dapat jumpa then weekend also like I also busy
we were hang up till five and then uh I went home and then I woke up at like twelve then I called him and ask him if he wanted to come along and he say ya he wants to come along but he says but he's like half-awake so I was like never mind lah you just sleep I'll go with sharinah and simon and then after that I tell him lah then after that I want to do my school stuff abeh he macam like upset
then I also macam like annoyed lah pasal he yesterday he cakap he nak hantar you know like he want to fetch me and send me here like and then last minute he say like last minute he like still sleeping then I like ah fuck it lah I'm just going go myself then I don't know so that was a bad start to the day
no lah I tell him already I I sampai then he never reply
oh oh there's one the nice one the one the dua tingkat right
what's what does simon want to do nak buat apa
then you kena tunggu ah how long was the simulation
ah that's not bad tak tunggu lama ah
I mean even when you're not influenced even if you're not drunk tak mabuk you still cannot predict what that's so funny
cause they already like nak masakkan you then is that it
you makan apa seh kat situ azizi still got
he buncit already meh
ah pasal dia punya percentage for exams is the they um turunkan for exams so they put it at every other uh like assignments quizzes so they increase the percentage there so it's heavier for the assignment than quizzes it used to be like five percent now the quizzes are like ten percent that's whole grade leh babe
so like I have to do properly lah then I taking I taking four modules sia babe like fucking busy I'm so sorry for saying that word but but I'll be so busy tak ada time
ya so I'm telling aqil like I'm gonna be busy I tak ada time for him sometimes like for during the weekdays
he gets it tapi dia pun sedih ah sometimes
ah dia macam kalau I boleh buat you pun boleh buat gitu ah
ya I think gitu ah
lain ah lain I cannot sia like he that time he also he only one module lah then I got four modules
cause the other day he was asking me eh err do you have lobang for like then it's like aiya syrinah boleh cari sendiri ah but like you know the previous place I worked at the dyslexia association of singapore they they paying quite high oh now lah
ya it's macam learning centre punya timing ah but it's lepak ah the job is it's damn lepak
no babe it will like strain your body sia then you want to have baby camne nak have a baby if you're gonna be tired all the time
then you can just hantar him lah
tinggal mana seh babe
that's so freaking far from dari bishan pergi choa chu eh pergi his ah camp is kat mana
like you beg her that's what I would do I would pujuk her I'll cium her kaki sia to kasi the bilik
it's like girl I'll get you an iphone and ipad anything you want just let me have the room five days a week you just live in the hall for five days a week a few nights a week and then on the weekends you can have it wah susah sia tak ada rumah sendiri I swear it's damn hard
wah then must tahan like this for satu tahun
no wonder simon kata want to get his own car the other day
it's not cheap sia babe tu hari I tolong top up kan aqil punya minyak cause he was driving me around so I offered to bayar for the minyak ah I only kasi fifty dollars and it's like
what the hell it's so mahal sia their minyak the fuel consumptions is like shit
it's mahal as shit man I swear it's like honestly bike
like I I tengok also if like
and it's all the way at the lim chu kang there sia what bus will pergi sana
tak payah lah oh my god you know what I think right it's a good thing that you're not working right now because you can like hantar simon
sleep in or you know not the one to trouble you but kesian sia he he like I also will think like
but it's only like um august september october november lima lima bulan jer tinggal then after that you guys can like like breathe a little right
the doa the berkat the berkat from the family like you know like another I don't know lah to me doesn't matter as long as got I don't need my makciknya berkat it's okay god sees me and god loves me so that's fine
I feel like as long as ya I feel like if you're pregnant tak yah sudah it's like forgo the whole idea but since you're not pregnant you know planning planning
right so are they agreeable to return you the duit after kalau in december tak boleh hold a wedding are they going to return the money
but that like dengki sia
oh masih tu ah
I think you should like list down all the deposits as you meet them macam everything tau you list down from A to Z how much exactly you have spent and you have paid for and then you include like what their what's the stand of the vendors like are they willing to uh and then you also include like you you um macam if you get pregnant then how you gonna get married you can get married like can have a wedding and then but then they will open it till twenty twenty one then like how sia you nak macam it's a lose-lose situation for you in all in all aspects lah like you still going to lose money sia
and at this time leh macam
macam like you lost thousands of money eh just because like orh the company need to earn money the company didn't give you anything back
it's not even your fault sia it's not even your you and simon's fault you guys are like preparing for it and then like had had it been uh how it was planned I feel like it wouldn't be this stressful or this difficult by now like everything should have settled down you know like the majlis are over like you get duit salam you know
I told aqil I had no expectations like kalau dia nak kahwin kahwin ah but other than that I'm just thinking at my own time ah cause like I'm not trying to find someone to settle down to start a family with like
of course tapi I tak nak macam okay I need to find a man yang I boleh kahwin no it's like I want to find a man that I love and then slowly everything will uh fall into place lah like if if we kahwin then kahwin like but ultimately I feel like uh it's important that aqil and I learn about each other first and like trust each other and like be accepting ah of one another
so like we end up finish right now where we're just trying to figure each other out so pelan-pelan ah
because we are exclusive kita tak cakap we we kita tak berbual dengan orang lain like we love each other like we see a future in each other tapi um
so he say ah like let's celebrate or officiate um hujung tahun
tapi kan babe but there are certain things that I'm still not used to I tak biasa like him looking at my phone
he must see me siapa text he must see me siapa call
I'm not used to that and then he's like I nak tengok your gallery I was like is this what my friends do his eyes are all ugh in my mind like low key I'm still like single because like mentally like I'm trying to like you know
oh right so anyway like in december he kata like he wanna get promise rings that he says that he want to get promise rings for us like start working towards marriage and then I macam oh then he cakap ah actually dia dah start saving like he's very uh thrifty like
like a lot of things happen because of him like macam me and my parents like ya like me and my parents
then I was really sad cause during my birthday dorang tak wish I um
I know like I know he's an adult like I know dia boleh jaga diri dia sendiri dia dah besar like he'll be fine but on the low-key I still like think about him sometimes like is he okay like is he eating well is he like
so like I was so sure of hassan ah I wanted to fight it out fight it out for him oh my god okay I nak bilang you something ah yesterday yesterday semalam I told aqil this I say I cakap dengan aqil um
it's so crazy like how like at peace I am with how things like how things um tertulis ah lah like is everything tertulis what like
belum I belum delete I still I still masih ada kat phone
dekat my phone
kenapa I tak tahu I tak tahu asal I tak delete
I I tak nak tengok ah the gambar-gambar like it makes
kau nak but
that's like trying to be macam they are trying to
lepas tu um dah kahwin after a few after a few years dah penat like pretend to be someone that you're not
cakap melayu lah okay so itu saja tentang hassan
ah tentang hassan dan aqil
oh I still macam sedih seh you and simon tak pergi honeymoon
the thing yang I akan look forward to right
thai pancake sedap dok thai pancake
ya but krabi punya water activities mm lame juga ah
I nak ikut I nak ikut mak dan ayah
tak boleh itu honeymoon
okay abeh atas I tell my parents I go with you then over there we separate
then kat sana kita separate
kalau pergi krabi
ah ah kita I tell
I tell my parents that I go dengan you then kat kat sana then I separate lah dengan aqil lah
no tapi nak buat like you can do your own things boleh buat benda sendiri boleh
lepak jer water activities makan lepak
you don't like macam buat activity
tapi macam sightseeing pergi like hiking pergi like um visit temples and shit
I'm okay to like shop like maybe half a day or like two hours or three hours kalau the whole day nak pergi shopping I boring seh like bosan gila
macam restless as err especially if like I tak cause I don't really like shop much
if I don't have anything that I like then boring gila seh
I feel like kita should go
buat anak dekat bali
uh kalau kita empat pergi bali aqil dengan I kita pergi uh ee kita get high
kita get high on shrooms kita get high on mushrooms
orh yesterday um we saw aqil ah class like classmates schoolmates at marina barrage then they're like he was with his girlfriend oh my god the girlfriend cantik gila sia I was like freak look like girl crush as fuck and then like uh ya melayu but she doesn't look malay I think she's mixed then
I like macam like I say hi ah but I like frozen a bit so tell I a bit shy cause like I'm flustered and then aqil was like are you like shy then I was like no I just I couldn't tell him that I'm like like I'm secretly crushing on your friend's girl
because right babe when we duduk in the car aqil need to on the aircon and then it will run on fuel so like
I am not complaining ah cause I also don't mind the aircon his car anyway I tak complain lah pasal I pun nak aircon the kereta dia anyway so up to you lah you nak on aircon I okay jer you nak waste nak waste gas
but I think one thing that I need to like um get used to is dia punya cemburu
ya like he tells me he's not a jealous person dia cakap dia tak jealous tapi
bila I cakap pasal like my guy friends or like shah shah sia shah is like the most platonic friend like he's the most respectful friend ever
then like he gets like kind of jealous then macam oh maybe because he doesn't have many like girlfriends and even if he does they're not good looking
like to me I tak jealous pasal like you can have as many girlfriends as you want
like to me it's like uh old friends that's fine if you if you found a new girlfriend that one I'll be suspicious but old friends to me is like kalau you nak dengan dorang you dah lama dah dengan dorang
so like the fact that you and dorang tak together that means like you guys don't want don't have anything lah between you
I punya timer five three two eight
orh pasal aqil tak practising like he doesn't know the basics babe
he was saying like I love your daughter I'm working hard ah to earn a a stable income and I'm also working to better myself as a muslim then I was like oof damn cause he dulu tak pernah puasa then he say for the last two years he's been puasa full lah
so macam
especially practising muslim so macam like ah but macam I have friends who like drink but then they go solat jumaat
then it's like ya then it's not morals but I think it's more of like his view on people like dia dia punya
pendirian ah like dia rasa like it's okay for him to do it because dia tak practise he's not a practising muslim tapi kalau kawan dia buat kawan dia practise practise religion then itu salah so like I don't wanna ya so like macam oh okay like that's your view too
gasak kau lah nak buat apa you you dah besar you tahu apa salah apa betul apa so I tak kesah ah dia nak buat apa
not my responsible to tegur you because you dah tahu all this you dah tahu and like siapa I nak tegur you know
so I think part yang dia like in terms of I'm just scared macam my parents ada high expectations on aqil like they
they nak ni nak tu then they will they will I scared they feel like aqil is not a good enough person to like
can be my husband which is not fair lah pasal they say that based on their own checklist when it should be on my checklist because it's for me
like I yang nak kahwin pe
I think my my parents punya fear is also because like if I get married they're passing all their responsibility of me to that guy
so they are scared that that guy don't care about his responsibility on me not just like monetary wise not just like health but in terms of preparation for the after life lah like once kita dah
meninggal like you know that kind of thing
macam tak sincere jer
then if like in december if my parents are okay then we will like apply for house you know look for our macam we will start planning lah like properly macam
apply for house then like um because aqil just started working so his is tak banyak
I feel like I feel like aqil is very very reasonable dan dia punya like
dia tak macam kata dia kata dia tau dia like dia dia will dengar cakap orang then after that he will like process and then he would
macam be with
like as a partner dia
dia faham like the what is understanding in malay babe
a'ah lama seh tak jumpa
my work cancel ah pasal COVID
tengah cari kerja ah ah
because dulu I kerja macam
events gitu lah then events semua macam
tak ada events gitu so

oh gitu
irritating kan macam kerja berat sangat gitu nak buat like you know
tak ada mood eh
duduk office right ya a'ah
but either way I don't like to work at home then your your your school pun home based juga ke apa
always all the way like that ke pasal COVID
I'm already malas because like the first
two month you know circuit breaker I really tak keluar rumah
then uh ya then after that then it was so hard to go out again macam
tak tak jadi circuit breaker circuit baker tak
siapa kisah uh nevermind lah like that time I was so bored
like I make the the you know the brown sugar pearl then the dalgona coffee semua I make
tak ada kerja ah
ya tapi tak jadi ah some some some okay some
ya some success then some is like macam
tak jadi ah then I'm try to make apam balik but it's like
not that nice like pasar malam kind
tak apa ah
oh wow but I don't like to order kat luar because like
actually I eat macam benda yang tak halal ah macam no pork no lard I just makan you know
ya lah ya lah like kalau keluar kan boleh like choose whatever I want to eat you know
apa tinggal mana ang mo kio
oh ya that one also aku ada story
eh but jurong okay what I don't know I mean at least when I go there kan macam
a whole new world for me ah like macam tak biasa at all ah but then ya I used to like cause I was thinking macam jurong kan ada
banyak ah ya so it's like whenever I go there then tak tau nak makan apa ya so
ya maybe that's why we never like meet each other because you always there but then you go town a lot kan kerja and school
tak keluar juga ya lah ya lah
uh you know mister teh tarik gitu ah
gitu lah
rajin like more rajin in the kitchen right
then my mum was like oh bila nak kahwin you know things like that
I tempted you know because recently dia orang kata uh like
majlis like only ten people or something
ya apa ni
but you attached or tak
I see some of the comments kat facebook kan dia orang kata macam
dah dah dah lima then groomsmen like lagi lima orang
that's why then I was like patut lah
ya then they were like macam bising ah like uh
uh with my majlis perkahwinan then I'm just like
tak tak faham ah
tak tahu ah the name semua macam sama gitu I don't know ya
you boleh drive tak
so when I work at events because usually they pay quite high so I don't mind smiling you know like oh hi welcome to apa apa apa you know then
now like go out everything like because everyone wear mask what then also I think people cannot recognise me so I'm quite happy like I mean not like I famous ke apa lah
you don't want to tegur like that then you just like alamak dia ni lagi then
oh oh ya ya ya ya ya ya betul tak tak sombong ah nanti dia cakap sombong then you know cause usually never wear wear the mask then they'll be like
uh eh you very sombong eh sekarang like then I'm like
you penat kerja then you just like you know zone out and then you just walk home or something but then sometimes I bumped into them then I never see then dia orang kata I like macam
sekarang dah sombong eh what what what then I'm just like what you know so
now wear mask bedek-bedek oh tak perasan lah like you know like ya but I understand what you mean by rimas also I think that one is just because singapore is hot
nak snow tak nak ah that one kiamat already
actually I don't know whether I want to still work with them I like recently I got like macam change of heart
dah tua ah like macam tiring ah events
my friend dia nak jadi temperature screener kan dekat kedai tu kan
then dia orang kata mesti ada diploma then I'm like
susah sangat ke temperature screener you know like apa seh
tak makes sense ah I think dia orang macam sengaja nak
buat susah you know then they complain like you know oh nobody want to apply padahal
tapi the people like freaking toxic seh then I cannot take it then I just like say like I don't want to come back
kerja apa uh teaching
ah tak but I got um biasa ah tuition experience and like you know
I do events so I can quote unquote handle classroom gitu
ya then apa lagi eh uh
ya then now also like nak classroom but then because you have to adhere to the COVID regulations then like macam
every hour kena sanitise gitu ah like ugh
then macam malas gitu ah
ya but this one dia toxic ah the the
the other teacher no actually actually the the other teachers are quite okay lah cuma the management ah like macam
ngada-ngada ah I don't know how to say
then like the first three days the management tak datang so I'm like okay ah this job like not bad ah I quite enjoying myself like still not very
like macam
not very good friends with the rest of the teacher but boleh lah can manage lah you know not so
um tengok how I work lah you know
then then they say a lot bad things about me then dia orang
ya she damn cari pasal ah like with me like semua benda yang I buat which I think is like
not even her problem dia macam tak okay
then I like malas already then ya then like
if I know everything why I training right like bodoh pe perempuan ni
uh then then I know what he what they she roughly mean ah I don't get like everything but I boleh faham sikit-sikit ah
aku baru then aku tak tahu apa-apa you know things like that then I'm like
or is it the next day or something like that then she like tegur me ah she was like
then she was like okay I'm going to test you then I'm like eh kau orang belum ajar aku apa-apa then kau orang nak test aku
I know how to do lah gitu so I managed to pass the test lah then she was like okay actually um I think you can
uh you don't know anything so I uh that time I'm just like malas seh nak datang balik
you want kira work from home ah I don't want seh
but then now I I see like macam dia orang dah potong semua pokok semua I don't know what the hell they are doing but okay lah I guess
my friends semua macam introvert dengan homebody juga so it was quite fun lah for us circuit breaker we just
all on our computer then we all just like zoom call each other macam
you ask them to jumpa right like like
too wild too long in that's why I'm like macam
but then my parents dia orang macam nak my sis my younger sister to marry first
tak ah I think my relationship longer but my relationship uh I'm also attached to a non-muslim
ya it makes things more complicated ah I guess then my sister she macam
she attached dengan muslim guy so that's already one
macam sekarang right I was thinking like is it
marriage is just like macam
eh but then you know what so scary leh like macam
um recently kan I baca kat
facebook ah now now got a lot of free time what so more time to browse facebook gitu semua
wah then ah so if cause to me right macam kalau kita relationship then they cheat right at least we can break off
need lawyer need to sign things all macam ugh malas ah
uh tak I think they give up on me already
that's why like recently I you know rajin-rajin in the kitchen then dia orang macam
oh um izzati finally can get married gitu you know but then I'm just like
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much kalau tahu I just
I mean I'm not sure if it's will be gonna be fun lah but you know at least like now I know that I'm not busy working because I don't think I want to be a working mum when I'm like heavily pregnant gitu you know
like chiongster also lah kerja banyak and things like that then my parents also not happy ah because like
supposedly twenty five kita kena dah married already you know but then I was still like working my ass off lah
mm mm betul lah then what huh
kita pun ada cakap ah like discuss are you okay with living with my in-laws for a while
then she say it's like hell lah because the mother in-law macam
like have a lot of expectations of her gitu
but sometimes kecoh is fun you know
or you mean the other kind of kecoh
I know that's why but I've talked to her before then she cakap dia tak nak ah she nak cari rumah sendiri juga
like you know hari raya you pergi like rumah kat jurong then mesti ada kucing punya I don't know ah I don't know how to say ya
I never say ah bukan aku cakap eh
oh pergi pasir ris then I oh pergi changi okay then pergi jurong ah I
seram seh
oh but recently my sister kena then I was like what the hell
a bit overconfident lah dia orang kata
so so it's like I'm like oi uh why you follow me like you know padahal I'm just a
sometimes dia orang will follow from a distance which I can still like macam
buat bodoh lah you know then
there was one guy who even like macam
naik kan then you know usually you go whenever whichever door is nearest to you and that is
and actually because I want to lean ah because I malas
recently kan I feel like macam I want to move to the west side because
ya so it's like macam I feel like if I live nearer to the west it will be easier for me to get a job there
life you know like sometimes the the kerja is like so far away from your rumah then it's like ugh malas ya
so ya lah ya lah macam I think if I'm nearer to the west I probably won't uh what
ya lah cause in ang mo kio like macam nobody ever sleeps
then sometimes like three kan ada orang cakap-cakap kat telefon then dia orang ketawa like laugh their heart out then I feel like so irritated you know
because he also still studying then he want to like uh like what you say lah macam nak habiskan sekolah dulu
sebab dia nak jadi teacher so now he studying the subject
because he wants to work at punya kind of school
ya and then that when during within that eight years right he still haven't kerja you know so I have I probably still have to wait another few years for him to be able to afford a house
say before that he is macam
like when he got school kan dia nak
uh but then that semester break it I think is is macam charity
that's why just like normal expenditure kan it's not like saving for a house gitu you know
ah cina lah
I was workaholic also lah then macam
whatever lah actually I was kind of those kind like oh I I independent woman I tak nak kahwin tak nak
ada children all then in the end
saje jer like you know like
try try cause nowadays got macam banyak apps gitu lah you know and websites also
so just make friends ah because I feel like macam
my age kan like orang semua dah kahwin then dia orang macam tak nak hang out so much
I suddenly meet him then suddenly like eh macam eh actually like if we get married and have a life together macam fun gitu juga eh ya so
oh you never tell me sekolah oh okay okay
the job punya name if I'm not wrong it was apa tu
it should be ah or siapa-siapa yang boleh faham ah melayu
ya but the job punya
the job punya description wah was not that not that bad uh
transcriptions oh sorry err listen to audio punya files
no I think it's like maybe macam punya type of thing uh
ya ya basically ah but I think there's also another aspect of macam
err natural language processing punya
because kan you know ada ada debate kan whether language is
err nature or nurture macam whether there is a biological foundation for language
the brain punya mechanics in obtaining language and I think they want to see whether they can apply that to ke tak whether the can learn
because my results kan belum keluar
if I apply then like a bit weird uh but I'm quite sure I will pass lah so I think tak ada hal kalau nak apply jer
special education punya teacher
because I fall into the macam the
only one exam was quite difficult uh the other three macam
gitu-gitu jer uh okay ah I did two of them quite well err
but at the same time kalau dia rooted in theory
that means if you don't get everything you won't get the highest punya score possible
oh so macam what are your strengths what are your weaknesses gitu ah
wait he got cut off oh because the break up room punya time was ending
sebarang jer siol leave in the middle of the thing
but then it's not like it's the benda ni compulsory kan
belajar belajar all the way like for hours and hours straight
for the eighteenth century punya lit
it's work for me throughout the four years uh for all my lit punya courses ah plus I hate lit uh so
biar lah dia
tak menyibuk lah dia
left maksud
oh kejap pause
but the appointment pukul enam pagi
nak kena siap apa seh you just need to go over to the location pe
okay so he's not actually baru ah macam gitu
so so your shift doesn't deal with macam punya barang-barang ah
apa and oo
kirakan dia lost ah
kita orang macam chair destroyers eh
I mean even on your off days also most likely kena tidur kan
it's like a fake fake off not I think it's a I think it's a shift punya thing uh pasal dulu nasri pun bila dia tengah kerja shift
macam even on his off days his time was taken up by
tidur dulu because you need you need that that rest before you can actually
wait so so you mean different punya clients
I think especially because macam lain-lain punya organisation ada lain-lain punya processes
so macam
solid base to work from within your own organisational punya itu
like it's dependent on the client rather than the itu
what what do you mean kena macam tu eh apa
first come first serve siapa nak ni dia cakap dulu gitu
pukul lima five in the morning
and you don't want to be the kind yang
tanya tanya tanya macam oi you want or not eh you want or not gitu
like I have a feeling like usually the one yang step up is you and not all all those other people yang itu
pasal kan ada apa budak baru nama jaden kan abeh seniors dia jaded
so jaden dengan jaded sama-sama
never mind never mind let them cringe janji janji kita punya audio dorang dapat
no no no it's like it's like bila kita orang dua orang jer berbual macam
kalau orang melayu apa ah
ada ada ada there's a there's a uh there's a phrase I think for for home wreckers
macam like like ah is it
is it kayu tiga
I think it's kayu tiga
oh okay lah betul lah I mean we we're having
I mean maybe the design of dia punya blocks also plays a part lah
but at the same time tak kan you shouldn't be banging stuff when it's so close to time orang nak balik rumah
tak kan orang sia-sia jer ketuk-ketuk siol
banyak ah anime
weeaboo kalau melayu apa weeaboo
kalau indo weeaboo
part dia pun belum sampai dalam anime dia
they had they had to stop for a while pasal COVID
uh apparently january next year in japan lah tapi kat singapore belum tahu ah
they have their own I'm quite sure they have their own macam
cinema punya based cloud storage that helps them to transfer everything
is it but then again like with film you can see like there's a lot of uh apa
err to do with the film ah let's say macam kalau dah habuk ke apa sikit then you can see brief flashes on the
from the film itself abeh nanti macam
tak lawa ah dia punya tu
ya ya that's the thing macam kalau film it's like
you are actually projecting it based on light and the and the image not the pixel punya density
like with digital all like you are constrained by dia punya
the pixels ah and the resolution that it was framed at ah macam you know lord of the rings
is because dia punya digital effects were actually rendered in ten eighty P
takde ah but it weren't limited like if you if you film
but all the and the extra extra punya barang-barang
was err ten eighty P punya rendering so if they were to upscale that to four K
the problem would be whether apa tu
dorang nak bikin balik tak semua dia punya effects
or whether dorang nak apa
err just use the existing punya rendering
and then upscale to four K tapi macam buruk ah macam zoom zoom in gitu ah that's the kind of effect
ah ya ya ya macam stretched gitu
tunggu ah dia
ah ya lah you have an eye for the frame I will write I will write in the script macam mana dia punya scene develops
you know like the three quarter removed punya angle or like
macam the kubrick punya
stanley kubrick punya follow through the halls
no tak nak tak nak
tapi macam kenyang ah boleh ah Gong Cha
how to work the camera to achieve that itu
I think director director macam gitu is
dah successful dah ada banyak duit then
the ego that comes with it is itu uh
I think it can go anywhere ah doesn't necessarily have to be macam
horror or itu it can be like it can be like drama
the person and the nature of the person macam who are you gitu
macam telling you
the the thing that I like about the original punya jurassic park is
that that err that apa
it kind of moves beyond macam like what what constitutes
like how you know there was a scene of the guy yang dia dia
err apa ada T-rex
then after that dia abandoned budak-budak then after that dia terus dia lari masuk toilet then T-rex gigit kepala dia
it's like err macam
I only remember the beautiful shots of the itu
and the shots with the with the ghost woman also macam lawa gitu
it's very macam ethereal
I cannot remember but it was the director of pengabdi setan
but I I want to watch pengabdi setan ah where to watch ah
because I I took the scriptwriting punya course apa
you make the film I write the script dah settle ah
like next year because tu apa tu
like my monitor punya resolution terlalu tinggi for the for the card
so macam I need a stronger card
isn't it like thirty plus bucks and black friday sale coming so I think confirm murah punya maybe like thirty thirty-ish maybe less
I know rehan that time buy on sale thirty seven murah
that's why it's so macam itu
sebab I don't like it ah because all the mat reps semua macam tengok macam uh demon slayer demon slayer
boleh beli dari AliExpress pe
of the thing because it's actually dia macam
macam with real respect for people punya feelings and not just some
random rom com yang dorang macam sebarang rojak letak kat dalam ni semua abeh mix mix mix abeh
janji kelakar habis ah
but at the same time like you must also consider macam kat japan kan
yang the source material dorang punya manga ke
dia punya light novel ke visual novel ke pe
has to be actually very popular dalam its own format
or sampah habis
different ke
so sahaja jer ah dia ambil
oh dia muda eh
husband dia singaporean pe
oh abeh dia just dapat kerja kat sini ah
maybe dia punya dia tak kasi basis book tak suka ah
wait dia tinggal kat mana
as in as in in indonesia dia tinggal kat mana
boleh eh
try uh nanti
you watch the show then after that you tell me you tell me what it is next time eh kita kita cari korean punya movie
wait so so far your your korean punya tu sampai tahap apa
as in like dia punya apa tu
boleh understand adult punya language ke
macam hyperinflation
came first sebelum writing
dia punya shine through lawa tak
oh macam too good to be true gitu ya
ah ya I mean it's not lucky lah it should fit because it's all out punya key cap apa
alamak minta tolong apa
alamak tutup eh tapi today today saturday kan normally weekend sabtu ahad buka apa okay mm
doesn't matter where tapi nak kena dekat ke nak delivery ke nak apa
mm I think for me kalau recommendation I recommend just nearby kalau since you're going out already might as well pergi to err minang minang
I forgot the name ah minang house I think minang or minang house I know of a few so that one yang popular dia dekat dengan masjid sultan just in front so kalau you masuk from the
eh from the back I think boleh tapi from the side lah the side gate you just park there then
masuk maybe like lima minute jalan lima minute
then mesti nampak mm mm
selalu long queue lah every time tapi the only thing is you have to go with your parents early lah kalau tidak lunch time selalu wah the queue is like gila like oh my god like you can see
I don't know dua puluh orang dalam queue
tak boleh tak boleh buat reservation ah just queue I mean I don't see them taking reservation lah because dia punya tempat macam macam biasa macam kedai kopi tapi dia macam atas punya kedai kopi sikit ah cause boleh ada two storey so and it's like a shophouse so definitely I don't think they take reservations but
ya lor just walk in lor but I mean kalau you want just go maybe pukul sebelas
mm ya sebelas setengah sebelas setengah for lunch tapi because dinner normally err I think tutup
um ya so I think kalau nasi padang kalau nak makan fresh you makan lunch lah jangan pergi dinner dinner
susah lah kalau nasi kalau you know lauk kalau basi sakit perut seh
tapi tu apa tu err singaporean yang buka apa
ke indonesian
orh okay interesting I mean cause from what I know kalau nasi padang normally lah selalu lunch kalau dinner I don't know I mean the the other one that I know is at paragon tapi that one is in a mall lah
and be be prepared to pay like I don't know I don't know I on average lah macam empat puluh lebih lima puluh lebih because dalam paragon you know lah it's an atas mall so tambuah mas
tu also very popular because last time you know lah tourist selalu pergi and then
err I think it's at basement basement one or basement one or two lah hmm so you can expect the place to be a bit more atas lah
ya lah you know lah situ beli gucci lah lah prada lah ya lah kalau ada duit lah kalau tak ada duit then different story lah tengok-tengok jer boleh lah kan tengok tak ada tak tak ada duit apa tak minta duit eh
mm try lah I think that one is one of the popular ones but I think makan situ lagi sedap
eh lepas ni nak pergi mana
pergi shopping ke
go earlier lah nowadays because aiya you know lah sekarang because of the pandemic alamak macam macam like nak masuk mall jer nak check in check out then like ambil temperature lah abeh mall lain habis store lain
abeh every store you go you have to take your temperature my god it's like I mean after awhile I don't know for you and your parents but I like for me when I go with my mum it's like penat seh just masuk keluar masuk keluar
like non stop and then kalau tak kalau tak ambil temperature tak ambil tak masuk dekat safe entry thing tak boleh masuk
even if you want to go for like five minutes also tak boleh
I don't know whether you experience that before some shops okay and then some shops tak okay I'm like really like come on lah like give chance a bit lah like you know but I guess everyone has to take it seriously lah that is true tapi macam kelakar because at the beginning bila this started semua orang macam alamak kanchiong kanchiong spider you know macam alamak
okay how ah macam how to check in how know contact tracing lah this and that and then after that after awhile
I think right the best kalau ada duit beli online sudah
uh uh betul memang memang my mum also experience that before dia beli apa lah kelakar it's not just baju eh it's like barang-barang rumah sekali after that dia punya colour lain and then dia punya size pun lain
ada boleh lah ada like macam all those order macam order from china all that how to how to return back seh
no gambar cantik selalu gambar cantik makanan pun sama every time kalau order grab dia punya gambar alamak macam photoshopnya wah it's really like damn atas the photo
and then sekali datang like that time okay it's funny that time eh I'm sure you mesti you ada story pasal like failed grab delivery punya apa tu
punya orders my god my my time bila I mean my experience so far is like oh my god
like it's really crazy like okay example leh that time I beli ayam penyet and then you know what happen nasi tak datang boleh gitu order ayam penyet nasi ayam penyet tau tapi nasi
tak ada and then bila bila complain dengan dia orang firstly dia orang tak angkat phone abeh dah dah gitu and then nak tanya lah
mana mana nasi kan nasi ayam penyet mana ada orang order nasi lemak tak ada nasi order nasi ayam tak ada nasi tak kelakar
and then dah lapar and then after that dia orang boleh cakap oh I think the nasi dia orang either dia orang lupa atau driver makan huh tak I don't know nak mengamuk ke nak ketawa ke nak apa
you imagine if it's you kalau if it's your if you are in my shoes tak marah
nak nak tunggukan nasi and then takkan so the the kelakar part is the kelakar part of the story is what know
bila I call them to go and say that the nasi tak ada and then dia cakap so you want me to refund you the rice or you want me to refund you the money so I said you have experience before or not the rice never come with your meal
depends on what I don't know whether to let's say ah tak tahu nak mengamuk ke nak marah ke and then
kalau nak tunggu nasi dia cakap apa tau dia cakap ma'am because right the restaurant err a lot of order ah ma'am and then the driver also not many so you have to wait ah maybe one or two hours untuk satu nasi I'm like ah
tak payah lah in the end my mum masak nasi sendiri ah so thanks lah so I then but the funny part is one week later this they send me email to say that hi ma'am we have refund you the money for the rice that's all so it's you know how much is the rice one dollar twenty cent thank you thanks grab
satu jam eh eh kalau I mesti dah
dah membara you know like dah lapar abeh dah mengamuk
abeh still nak tunggu satu jam eh tak payah sudah tak payah sudah itu beli mcdonald's sudah
ya lah masak nak masak boleh tapi nak nak clean up tu nak bersihkan eh tak payah lah
ah wah mesti crowded gila ah
abeh huh cancel
eh eh jahatnya sedih
so I think also susah lah macam the restaurant nak blame the driver and then the driver blame the restaurant then in the end siapa yang suffer seh
dia punya gaji bukannya berapa seh kesian mm mm
tu lah I mean I selalu tengok dia orang penat-penat datang dengan basikal lah dengan motor lah dengan kereta lah and then
selalu macam you can see that they're always in a rush like they're always like trying to go that trying to hurry themselves to the next delivery you know what I mean
ya so macam nak mengamuk-mengamuk dengan dia orang pun alamak macam susah you know macam kesian ah macam memang memang ni dia orang punya dia orang punya
apa tu dia orang punya job lah like tapi tak tahu eh macam let's say so is like I feel in the end the restaurant they blame the driver and then driver blame restaurant then in the end customer suffer lah
eh eh baiknya lah eh eh siapa seh tak nak pergi rumah dia gitu as in tip in cash or huh oh my god
mm mm betul
mm betul
mm mm betul
tu lah lambat lambat kenapa ni kenapa tu semua still ada comment lah singaporeans standard lah kalau tak complain bukan singaporean apa
susah lah nak order macam like that time baru my friend order apa eh I think dia order
susah kalau I mean that time my friend pun cakap cakap pasal nasi padang eh that time my friend order during bulan puasa ah during fasting month ramadan time I think just like two three months ago and then they order in bulk lah because dia orang ada macam
apa macam err open house eh bukan open house macam
err family gathering I mean as as small as the gathering can be lah you know following the guidelines and all that and then the funny part is dia hantar banyak rumah so they order macam maybe like four packet like empat packet satu rumah
so altogether maybe about empat puluh packet they just put you know lah
malay family banyak kan
so dia baik hati lah because like one of the days dia nak macam dia nak apa tu nak belanja nak belanja makan so they order to ten household and then out of the ten maybe half of the makanan basi ah dia punya sayur dia bungkus sekali sayur dia boleh basi and then macam mana bulan puasa orang nak orang nak buka nak makan
so dia punya order datang pukul empat
and then dia buka pukul tujuh tujuh tujuh setengah tujuh lima belas and then after that makanan dia basi so satu hari puasa abeh makanan basi tak sedih
ah abeh yang kelakar punya yang the the funniest part of all is that the owner of that coffee I mean of that err food stall dia boleh cakap apa tau oh err sorry ah to customer who got the food that is basi
ah ah so also kelakar lah because okay lah kalau macam restaurant maybe
maybe they can give you macam a bit of refund or what lah but because they are
correct and then nasi I mean okay nasi padang eh maybe on average maybe about five dollars but during the fasting month eh plus the delivery and everything my my friend paid about hundred plus tau then imagine half of the nasi basi macam mana gitu
tak ada tak ada tak ada refund tak ada dia boleh cakap oh we just hope the customer can understand and that's it so ya lah tu lah kesian and then it's like macam
pergi mana cycling kat mana seh
boleh juga lah eh tapi esok sunday seh confirm banyak orang
oh masih
ah ah sama mountain bike ah sama tak tak tak tukar
mm I think makan apa err cinema tempat wayang kan masih tutup kan oh dah buka eh tapi dia punya gambar semua macam gambar dulu-dulu jer siapa seh nak tengok
mm mm I think sekarang that day I think what lima puluh or something like that
boleh lah sounds like a plan bro
eh tapi kat changi banyakkan dia punya tempat yang nasi lemak macam semua semua best nasi lemak so semua semua kalau tanya mana satu yang bagus dia cakap ah semua semua famous tak tahu I think I don't know like five
six five or six stalls there right that jual nasi lemak or is it is it more than that I can't remember dah lama seh tak pergi makan changi tapi as usual kalau nak tanya orang
mana best nasi lemak semua best ah depends ah yang mana depends on apa like you suka tapi more or less sama apa selalu nasi ayam ikan timun sambal dah kan apa apa yang beza dia
kan unless it's sama apa kalau nasi lemak I mean okay lah the good thing is that dia punya price there is like macam dua I think two dollars three dollars maybe ya
uh uh dia punya nasi punya banyak I always I always ingat dia punya ada dia punya stall kasih lauk banyak abeh ada nasi macam macam walao like mountain like that know makan tak habis
mm ya lah standard kalau makcik kalau kasi wah very generous then kalau senyum-senyum sikit nanti mesti dapat lebih
okay boleh mm
okay lah boleh lah hopefully tak hujan seh sekarang kalau weather you know lah macam unpredictable that day punya lah panas I think I check the temperature you know what's the temperature thirty four degrees seh thirty four degrees tapi
kalau you tengok iphone punya app kan dia punya degrees ada macam ada macam feels like ah macam macam actually
feels like is forty two eh wah forty forty two dah macam dekat dubai seh
ah ah tu lah it's like and then kelakar kan because nowadays bila panas very hot and then when it's raining it's like raining like flooded did you saw that time dekat dekat singapore I think kat mana entah changi ke pasir ris ke bedok the rain sampai flooding sampai banjir and then the banjir is so bad that
at the bus stop dia punya orang is standing on the seat eh
and the air naik all the way tau
macam bukan kat singapore seh
a'ah betul a'ah betul betul
ya and then I saw seh banyak orang macam video
and apa tu banyak orang video of the incident that happen then like one of them is so funny because kan at that point of time you it's like I think I don't know lah since circuit breaker or something like that
or phase one or something then the dia punya it was so bad that they there was water inside the bus leh and then they said they say nevermind it's okay that is close you can still take this bus because the water was like ankle deep you know
can you imagine so it's like you are literally it means if you wear shoes or slippers habis lah
basah kuyup seh habis ah
kesian uh uh tu lah that's why it's like really not like singapore seh
and then means weather forecast semua salah lah
tu lah like today I saw the weather forecast actually suppose to rain dia cakap actually suppose hujan sampai tuesday ah next tuesday tuesday or wednesday then today punya lah panas mana tak dengue kat singapore
weird leh no but talking about dengue oh my god seriously the dengue cases did you saw I was just I was just telling my friend that day pasal the dengue case and then one of my colleague boleh kena dengue seh uh uh and the kelakar part dia mat salleh
dia dia asyik I think dia asyik keluar petang ah pergi jogging ke apa entah lah tak ingat lah apa dia cakap abeh dia cakap oh I I was out sick for one week so I said lah how are you so I thought maybe um like he fever ke cause you know lah nowadays kalau sakit it's like either you kena COVID nineteen or you kena
dengue and then the funny part is dia cakap dia kena dengue
uh uh confirm and then dia dah takut because they dia ingatkan that kena masuk hospital lah so actually tak payah because I think you have to self isolate for seven days
I I I don't know how he got it I think dia cakap that maybe because dia selalu keluar petang ah dia keluar petang to go jogging around dia punya area and dia standard lah dia tinggal dia tinggal kat robertson quay you know that near to the clarke quay boat quay area ah then after that
err don't know how he balik and then dia macam dia pening lah abeh dia batuk-batuk lah and then dia macam
dia rasa macam something is wrong lah so dia cakap actually dia pergi doctor first time then doctor say oh maybe you're just tired because dia sekarang kan everybody work from home ah then after that dia ingatkan
okay lah maybe I'm just tired I don't have enough sleep blah blah blah and then in the end dia pergi to another doctor the doctor cakap dengue then dia dah panic lah
so dia macam eh macam mana ni macam mana seh so dia dia takut that dia kena hospitalize lah because kalau hospitalize most likely you can be in the ward if like let's say you get dengue maybe instead one week it becomes two weeks
p[a'ah tu lah and then nowadays you know lah kalau ambil is not like those days lah ah like dulu kalau tak nak pergi kerja pergi I mean ambil boleh lah one two days stay at home sekarang is like your name might be on the record you know and then your boss semua tahu habis seh
is it tapi dia orang datang hari-hari tak
abeh macam mana seh dia orang nak check macam I mean you see the the mosquito is so small how they want to check like okay lah I know they can check for the eggs and all that but how can they check because
I saw like err kat apa tu at the west side I think yishun or what is one of the hot spot
and then like every other day ada fogging ah
and then fogging you know lah the smell oh my god and it's like everybody work from home it's like my friends who are staying in yishun and woodlands they say every other day ada fogging
and the whole house will smell of the fogging smell macam nak muntah seh and it's like I don't know don't know that's why I'm thinking like how can they see the mosquito can they see I don't know or maybe they got their own equipment is it
my mum even funnier bila dia dengar pasal these dengue cases and then like because that day I read it was ten thousand so then when I was talking to my ang moh colleague the the guy then his then err he said he doesn't know lah that because they ang moh apa he from sweden ah dia tak dia tak dia tak baca local news sangat lah baca pasal COVID nineteen COVID nineteen
and the pandemic and everything that's happening in the world lah then but then he never read about the dengue then he said oh I didn't know that dengue was a very big thing so I said ya it's actually ten thousand cases sekali I read on the day itself is already more than twenty two thousand cases eh it's crazy my god
tapi macam mana seh
macam mana nak tengok kalau even if your eyesight is like perfect eyesight macam mana nak tengok
by the time they want to gigit you they just gigit
so leceh lah sekarang kalau kalau sakit then susah tau nak kena pergi doctor lah nak kena self self isolate lah then macam-macam ah like macam-macam test seh nak kena
nak kena ambil is like it's a good thing if you don't get sick nowadays but now this this I mean getting sick you know lah is hard to predict right ya so kalau dah
I don't know lah just keep healthy lah ah just keep on exercising makan betul-betul jangan makan all the
he just drink water a lot everyday because dia tak ada medicine for dengue there's no cure just like COVID nineteen scary ah
macam-macam lah nowadays
and it's like during a pandemic and then like you don't see the end you know like every other day mesti ada something you know and it's only what august oh my god
ya lah ya lah betul susah lah
ya lor that's why how seh they check everyday like that tak penat ke macam
mm mm ya lah that's why that's why the dengue also increase because I was just reading that construction work has stopped right and then you see lah the weather like panas lah hujan lah then all the air bertakung like that then mana tak dengue seh ya then there's nobody like
because my house area ada banyak new flats all the flats and all that so all the construction you can see like there's no more
construction going on like it's so quiet like all the new blocks macam seram seh like so quiet mm so I guess lah because of that also ya they never really check on the construction sites
more and more ya mm mm betul lah correct
ah ah betul lah kesian eh
mm mm tu lah makan maggi jer lah hari-hari they are also heroes ah mm mm
no lah work from home lah because office tak buka then how
mm mm kat raffles leh oh my god
sama ah
mm mm tu lah
correct and then kalau you know lah kalau lunch time situ not only crowded like raffles and area I mean most times you are like spending so much on your lunch like you know you know lunch you know the lunches are like what
ten to fifteen dollars on average and then and that's like every other day kalau makan luar jer dah mahal imagine like five times a day five times a week you have to do that walao like it's a lot of money you know
correct like all the small small things ah like I think you spend less lah when you're working from home and like we're staying home more often you really just spend on like the essential items like groceries and like you know just the things that you really need I mean clothes also you want to buy nak pergi shopping nak beli apa seh
electricity bill lah bill air bill api
mm mm betul
mm ya a lot of a lot of emphasis is on work life balance nowadays ah I mean you tengok ah kalau
whatever lah like macam you are
kelakar right it's really like three hundred and sixty degrees eh completely different like but the I guess now people just have to accept what is the new normal lah you know what I mean
kalau tidak susah macam mana seh macam like if people still keep thinking that things will go back to normal like think about travelling like travelling is like
every every singaporean loves you know mm mm like that day apa tu baru national day weekend like most of the time like thousands of flights will go and that day somebody uploaded online like I think only seven flights went off during that long national day weekend
tu lah
mm mm betul nak fourteen fourteen days leceh lah nak pakai mask lah pakai ni lah and then I don't know like the amount of money that you're spending is not worth it lah
virtual workout virtual makeup I think that day I baru nampak virtual makeup session then like
like I feel like companies are really stepping out of their comfort zone to like provide virtual stuff for people in general you know so I think it's quite impressive like that day baru I was watching a play online like can you imagine like instead of going to the theatre you can actually watch it at home and the best part is it's for free interesting right
mm mm betul betul lah netflix eh netflix hari-hari
ya lah tapi the amount of things on netflix you can watch is
homerun even like malay shows I think what bunga tanjung or something like that that they have so it's quite interesting and it's like they have diverse range lah like malay english they even have like tamil shows and all that it's quite interesting like I mean I guess
I think dah buka lah but like I mean you have to take precaution right
you know going out is still a bit of a like you know you just go out like you say lah just go out for awhile then balik cepat-cepat you know what I mean so ya video calling is the new
neighborhood right ya correct correct even the fireworks seh oh my god that was so amazing like I didn't know that you cannot you I always thought that oh the fireworks you have to do at padang because that's the designated spot or like that's the legal legally allowed place but this year oh my god so many different places kat tampines ada kat jurong I think is it
once every four years right mm mm millions of dollars also the amount of money imagine all the duit
mm ya ya lah betul lah
boleh nyanyi mm
sure everyone around the world feels that way you know what I mean like you rasa like macam-macam lah you rasa marah lah you rasa sedih lah you rasa ni lah macam-macam
macam-macam perasaan tapi at the end of the day mesti positive lah you know kalau tak positive susah seh I mean hari-hari takkan I mean the thing is that
cannot be everyday you are positive lah of course some days kalau nak sedih ke nak marah ke just feel all your emotions and then
tak penat ke eh mm mm mm mm
betul no lah and also you complain
mm mm betul mm mm
ah ni kalau ni singaporean kalau tak complain bukan singaporean kan
mm mm betul I mean there's good and bad lah I mean like you said like
you complain and I don't know macam
mm betul
ya but also like I guess the other annoying thing or like the the recurring issue that is always being talked about is wearing of the mask lah right I mean ya I mean singapore nak semua orang kena pakai mask
tak payah pakai mask
so like macam suka-suka jer then I like
eh boleh ah I thought this wearing of mask thing it should be like mandatory lah for all but then I guess
jaga diri baik-baik lah you know kalau pakai nak pakai up to you lah you know
semua nak jadi famous ah semua tak ada kerja nak jadi famous ah so okay lah so dia orang tak nak pakai mask then like I guess
tu lah
bukannya mahal ke the mask ada I think what less than one dollar you can get already
uh tu lah
nak buat apa five year aku tak tahu aku cakap macam oh definitely I want to excel in my career meaning that I wanna be moving up the ladder not just in terms of management role lah but you know like also like macam okay if this is something that I have never done before so that to me is also a progression right or if let's say
I was like apa seh nak cakap
I aspire to inspire kau nampak kau nampak
yes so ah I had like three interviews and then um so this is what for it's like so as in I got three interviews err no was it three I think I I had three interviews and two follow up post yes yes yes from the same company so um I felt that macam this company is kan and and
I I wouldn't say informal it's it's formal enough to know err where you stand or what you want to get to know you as as as a candidate but at the same time it's not like stressful you you know how interview can be can become like macam like siala I want go interview but I scared sia yes like you know you get so intimidated by the interviewer
we choose it in a in a sense where this pandemic is gonna be for quite some time so even if you find a replacement job you must you be able to like the job if not you gonna drag your feet to work you know and you also have to think strategically in a way where macam um aku kerja sini kalau aku tak suka aku nak nak berhenti kerja lain then bila aku cari kerja lain I'm fighting with a lot more competition then after that macam
very much so yes okay lah no look my training ground is actually quite far tapi aku aku fikir panjang kan dia cakap five year plan kan aku fikir five plan dia dekat dengan rumah aku saya pun okay
yes my new colleague tell me okay okay we will see you become like reach this position in five years I just no lah no lah no lah satu tahun then coming july dua tahun
cepat juga kan I feel like macam wah all the job demands macam I'm like just taking in everything so it's good that you when this new colleague masuk kan beberapa macam
berlega sikit lah hati aku tak payah banyak sangat buat macam everything is on me you know and some more yes but when he ask me like oh like you want to become a we have a senior position at my workplace in the next few years I'm not sure you know having the having my own local brand
but I really wanted that tengah estate house get the the sales of balance flats if I get it the house will be ready in may twenty twenty two twenty twenty three because it was the first few launch yes the one that they released in november as in recently the house will only be ready in twenty twenty four or twenty twenty five jauh seh
because my fiance dia tak ada passion nak pergi sangat to get a house planning or let's say we'll see how
not not like what's in it for you but more of macam
uh role in terms of career wise I'm like in redeem kan so I used to be in right and then now I'm in like mass production retail so people it's funny macam we see that aspect of people who like I don't want to buy ah you know I want to save money ah now now tough time lah cannot spend lah
and and we haven't had a lot of okay lately there have been a few chinese tourists tourists bukan bukan local aku takut
boleh bah certain certain countries can come in singapore already what
so macam like a the same thing lah okay yes I I hear the same thing you know like now cannot lah no cannot spend lah now err must save money you know market very bad financial very bad blah blah blah blah blah but your bill can go up to like what five six hundred dollars
average family probably would have one lah fashion jenama big brand it's like that two iconic brand lah orang queue lah kat luar uh uh okay you know and chanel
orang people queue lah sia kat luar people queue people queue outside and these are some of the people who queues outside their store come up to my stores with paper bags of their stores and come to my store asking me eh got discount walao eh you buy eh you buy chanel then come to my store and then ask me for discount

that day suri we went up walk in the middle okay K kita turun turun woohoo dah sampai bawah
aku pekik like takleh stop takleh stop takleh stop macam mana nak stop then I just like literally just jump out of the the the board lepas tu dia jatuh
but previously aku buat gitu juga I like you know the
ya then after that the the barefoot kaki ayam girl said lain kali nak turun slope is either like you control or you just squat so is like heavier so is like slower oh ya why I didn't think of it
dekat ring eh macam dekat ice rink gitu back there
she wanted to bring then but but I didn't ask lah then err the husband or something tell us she wanted to bring the roller it happen to just come out lah the speed roller skate then like dia kata lupa nak bawa then they were matching you know the husband was wearing hot pink short

takde eh
naik basikal I see the cuaca today like hot only
I need to wear face masks right now sekarang dengan COVID nineteen ni semua
oh the kain yang macam instructor when they do instructors when they do camp they wear that buff mask right that kind that oh ya okay okay
tadi that time you told me before lah apa you cakap you you cycling abeh ada benda go into your mouth is it
susah nak nak bernafas lah ni
lalat as in ah as in lalat as in housefly
but a lalat the black flying buzzing thing
you swallowed you went to swallow ah the housefly sedap tak
so you were cakap orang cakap apa ni perfectly fine ah after you accidentally swallowed a housefly
the oh ya true true ada tempat yang
err ya I mean ada tempat
entah mana lah suka they they love to makan all these maggots spiders all these weird weird apa binatang ni semua
no no I I don't I don't want to eat all these any weird animals eh you said you you ride bicycle eh datang sini
and you tengah ambil your motorbike licence right are you oh yes
kat mana where you take where you taking ah
and kalau you naik motorbike if I'm not wrong lah if I'm not wrong err if you work under foodpanda dia punya gaji lebih kan sepuluh dollar per hour I think
tapi I think I got some friends who are under
who are under foodpanda dia orang I ada tanya lah I ask them eh how much gaji bagus tak if you work with foodpanda as part time and stuff and they say it it's not bad lah actually like I think they have the for foodpanda if I'm not wrong they have the
hourly rate and then if within that one hour you boleh hantar banyak makanan they call it docket if I'm not wrong
so if you can hantar more food means you earn more dockets and there's ada macam bonus lah kasih dia orang happy sikit kasih the riders happy sikit
macam competing lah
oh okay tapi if I'm not around kan ah kadang-kadang if the customer happy you bawa
their their makanan cepat-cepat then they will boleh kasih you tip eh
tapi tengok lah tapi ada orang kasih ke tak
okay okay okay tapi ah what's the
what's the paling banyak ah orang kasih your tip
macam paling banyak tip one time they give you one big tip ada tak
one customer kasih give you ah ten dollar tip
wah very good ah but oh ya your bicycle I see I like so terkejut no I follow my friends semua nak beli basikal I thought lah I ingat one bicycle maybe
sixty dollars ke hundred dollars ke but
and we can you imagine you tengah hantar makanan orang tengah tunggu at the house waiting where is my food alamak then find out the the rider bicycle pancit or the wheel
ah pecah ke apa then like quite wasted lah if you buy a cheap very cheap kind of bicycle
oh ya lah dia punya drivers kalau nampak orang bicycle they will try to try to apa tu drive very near to the bicycle ya lah I mean I know that you all want to rush for more orders means more money but then sometimes terlupa that eh you guys are on the road
and there are buses ada apa tu lorry ada motorcycles semua so next time just be more careful lah tengok lah before you pusing you tengok apa apa tu blind spot check back check back eh check back whether there any vehicles around you ah
okay okay then you tadi morning you told me you were taking your motorbike practical also right kat where again kat mana the ubi ubi eunos there right is it
ah so you macam tahu lah apa dia punya dangers and stuff
so next time when you dah dapat license your motorbike licence ke car license or lorry license so next time you know especially when you see eh got one cyclist coming or eh got one cyclists behind me you know lah to be more careful
eh wait wait that means you on which practical five eh lima
ah okay okay okay before oh ya prac five yang you have to do everything in the circuit then kalau pass prac six then only can go out at the road
uh okay tapi one thing about ubi eh cause I took my license there at ubi also
that dulu lah dulu lah when I when I took my license apa tu ubi ah very crowded so you just be very careful lah kalau especially when you first time keluar naik road
because I know some of my kawan they took the license motorbike licence kat
the one yang kat the one yang kat mana woodlands woodlands ya I know they told me that the area there sunyi ah quiet like not as many vehicles not as crowded macam kat ubi so I think for them was macam lagi senang to pass the test lah test
you naik basikal to ubi
oh you tak ambil public transport
orh okay okay okay then for you kalau dari hougang want to cycle to woodlands itu dah penat bro
by the time you want to start your lesson at woodlands you already penat you cannot really ride the motorbike motorbike ride you I think I don't know whether motorbike would go then later you kena scolding from all instructors
tapi I think one practical how much is it now
dua puluh eh dua puluh lebih
oh yes yes as you I think as you naik naik uh as you progress the cost of course lah dah lagi more mahal
kalau you go out on the road I think one instructor the ratio one instructor is to five
six or five riders I think that that's lagi more mahal lah as you go along this
but when do you think you will get your license though boleh beli motorbike boleh naik motorbike no need to ride your bicycle
lagi that day yang kat ah news north west line the major ah blackout alamak itu dia orang during bila peak period and then the red line the green line dengan dia punya yellow line sekali breakdown
ya but ah apa tu when you when you dah pass eh which I hope you do pass soon which motorbike you looking for yamaha suzuki
one five zero itu kan the tuning training centre punya motorbike eh tak
oh you can get cause I know my friends yang sekarang tengah pakai they say it's err fuel efficient dapat jimat duit sikit
atau kalau you banyak duit sangat kan you boleh beli those err more expensive motorbike yang macam triumph
triumph or ah the one I paling suka when I see people riding on the motorbike uh royal enfield
oh but you don't want to buy a first hand punya motorbike eh
wah and then kalau you tak ada here for six months then who going to use your bike cause you need to always someone needs to start start your motorbike right you cannot leave it err sleeping for too long period
but I mean the transport transports sekarang tak boleh reliable sangat lah sekarang
tapi I would say that the transport has he has been getting better lah dulu I think a few years back three or four years back ada this one period of time macam every week confirm plus chop ada breakdown every week confirm ada
breakdown lah ada yang
the travelling time was too long ada jer problem kadang-kadang but I would say now is much better lah they're doing a much better job but but having said that masih boleh improve that they can still improve so that's my take
the best surprise eh yang I paling dapat uh
ini many years ago lah eh many many years ago when a for my twenty first birthday selamat hari jadi eh my twenty first birthday ah my kawan-kawan kaki bola my soccer mates want to throw me a birthday
ya so I remember that time masih masih bulan ramadan that time when we were still fasting and then my birthday fell within that month lah
then err they chose this place namanya is called mark's place the one at eunos they wanted to belanja me dinner then okay I was like okay sure ah then I went down
they book the table for seven so senang lah bila time buka we all boleh makan together right
so I came down I was so excited lah kirakan eh I went there at about pukul berapa eh I went six thirty so I sat there and I was the first to come I was the first to arrive so okay I duduk I duduk there at the table
then I duduk I tunggu tunggu tunggu for my friends nobody turn up tak ada orang datang
so I just wait and wait and wait and then the next thing I know ada because the place where I tengah duduk uh is facing the road
so I saw this one kereta just drive past tapi nampak ni kereta macam pernah nampak jer this kereta then I noticed dia punya driver was my one of my teammates so I was like okay okay maybe they already arrived so I'll just continue sitting down so
oh by the way kita tak makan kat sini I tengok them they tengok me and then I still remember other tables
they went to put a blindfold around me and then I was like terkejut sikit lah eh asal tiba-tiba want to blindfold me right so they blindfold me and then they they put me in the car
then err so they blindfolded me so when I masuk the kereta I didn't know who is inside I don't know what was inside the car so you just tell me diam-diam and then just sit in the car they will drive me to a unknown location lah location yang I sendiri tak tahu so
but then I think the duration on the car trip was about twenty minutes I could hear like they went to make some pit stops because I can hear the the dia punya pintu
I can hear the pintu buka but when the pintu buka also I I cannot remove my blindfold okay then after that I
I felt like the car dah park and then my kawan-kawan say okay now you can uh get off the car so of course ada orang pimpin my tangan cause I already blindfolded I cannot just walk right I might fall into longkang or something
ah okay then I just ikut I just pimpin my friend tangan they brought me to a unknown location ah next thing I know when I open my blindfold I was at marina barrage heated gang marina barrage
kita kat marina barrage
ya oh if I remember correctly tak salah there were about
seven to eight more of my soccer teammates who were there and they they were sweet they letak uh picnic mat they letak uh fairy lights and they prepared some makanan like pizza which was good because I was hungry by then and
just to remind everyone that we were err tengah puasa time tengah puasa I was very hungry and then they prepared some food and drinks ada bawa uh game cards so that we could play and then we played some music and nice lah like people celebrate your twenty first birthday
yang paling best uh lepas kita dah makan dah sing song uh perut dah kenyang and then err one of them pass me a birthday present
and nasib is the birthday present that I have been wanting for quite some time it was a kasut nike like this specific kasut yang
was quite mahal lah actually so they managed to everybody chip in some money and then they bought this kasut that I think was about dua ratus lebih this pair of nike shoes
and honestly when if I were to buy a present for somebody I will tanya the person first like oh apa yang you nak you want a teddy bear ke you want
you want if motorbike cannot lah I not that kaya so I cannot buy for you a motorbike but if you want a storybook or a backpack boleh lah if you your birthday present what do you want
ya at that point in time bila aku dalam kereta macam eh
takkan they want to kidnap me takkan they want to hantar me to johor bahru or put me in a abandoned house or something ada lah there was a period of time I was like asal kereta ni macam suddenly so quiet eh like where is everybody in the car or suddenly they abandoned the car then I'm sitting there alone in the car not knowing what's happening
so but I trusted them I mean they are my apa ke tu ah kawan-kawan kaki bola so that ended well and I think the thing about a presents eh
because sometimes I don't want to belikan orang tu a present that they might not want or atau present like they won't use so either I will ask them personally like oh okay what do you want for your birthday lah or it's either I buy for them uh
vouchers like it can be macam adidas voucher it can be capitaland mall vouchers can be nike vouchers ah pergilah kau apa kau nak beli
I know kalau kalau perempuan dia orang selalu cakap lagi senang pasal can buy err gift card from sephora especially like sephora or you can buy from victoria secrets usually lah girls I think lagi senang to to buy presents for compared to a guy
took my suggestions I I wouldn't even call it suggestions actually I said that I tak suka kalau macam
uh big uh birthday bash macam ada orang kan they especially kalau
twenty one birthday they will have their macam nak glamour glamour have it at the chalet where they where they will invite macam kawan dia nenek dia cousin dia abeh nanti banyak sangat orang like I tak suka that kind of stuff lah
kawan-kawan rapat lah so is good thing that they didn't throw a big uh big surprise at a chalet or hotel so I do you like kalau anybody do like a big grand gesture like that
and also kalau macam banyak sangat orang especially kalau invite banyak sangat orang abeh orang yang you tak kenal atau orang yang that you barely talk to so you macam tak nak awkward lah then kalau banyak sangat orang also later you have to
you have to split your time with err different people and then I mean you cannot cut yourself into half right so you will have to speak with this group of people for like five ten minutes and then you kena go to entertain another group then you you'll be busy just entertain people actually
instead of having macam a very good time and macam shiok sendiri
and I so I feel like kalau like you want to have a this macam grand gestures right you need to kena fikir where you want to have your your birthday present where sorry where you want to have your birthday celebration until macam sakit kepala lah you have to think
about venue and then you have to book in advance kalau you want to do like
tempat mahal-mahal macam hotel you have to book maybe a few months in advance
maybe and aside from venue also you kena book
ah makanan I mean come on I mean when you invite people you don't want them to come there and then there's like nothing to eat anyway we're all singaporeans right so we we love our food so we need think about venue nak kena fikir pasal uh makanan
and then you have to send out invitation then you have to you if you want to have some entertainment then you have to fikir oh what entertainment do you want I mean kalau you have someone else who is doing the planning and stuff okay lah then you can like lepak don't have to
if you gonna dapat orang birthday planner or something like that then you kena bayar this birthday planner pakai duit lagi
oh ya I mean like quite true eh tadi you cakap pasal if your birthday on macam twenty fifth december ke or macam your birthday is on err
thirty first december where's the peak period macam banyak orang confirm nak nak book err tempat macam want to book the hotels dekat dekat dengan the floating platform so they can probably see like the fireworks and stuff
so that one will be even harder lah I would say or even if your birthday falls uh during national day parade I'm pretty sure it will be quite difficult quite difficult and susah to dapat all this uh bookings and stuff
and also kalau macam some people macam tak nak celebrate dia punya birthday kat singapore nak pergi overseas ke apa nak pergi batam
or let's say somewhere even further like you want to go poland or something to go and celebrate your birthday itu lagi mahal kau nak kena beli apa tu plane tickets semua tapi sekarang bila time macam gini
nobody saw it coming macam time COVID you cannot go anywhere man you have to stay in singapore you have to celebrate your birthday in singapore but of course it will be more gerek lah if you can celebrate your birthday in bali or something watching the sunset or sunrise that one confirm more gerek sia
like I think for me kalau if I can choose eh where I want to spend my birthday I want to go where's that tempat banyak sheeps ah new zealand
like honestly if I can if I can choose a place to celebrate my birthday or to choose a tempat for me to go holiday that would definitely been using you can go to the countryside boleh apa tu feed the animals you can play with the animals I mean come on man in singapore
err kambing so at least when you go places like new zealand especially dia punya countryside you get to see all this kind of animals and you get to do a lot of uh
natural activities like apa tu yang kat river the water rafting you can go hiking you can see
uh nice nice mountains and of course dia punya cuaca also lain lain from singapore singapore is always hot either hot or wet so at least there in new zealand if you can go during the winter times dapat juga some snow you pernah pergi new zealand eh
tapi kalau uh japan japan nak cari
halal food also was quite difficult I remember that time when I went with my family we went to go japan or we wanted to look for halal food punya lah susah and
it was not readily available so you have to do your macam homework lah before you go you must probably want to bookmark the places where you want to makan halal food
because it's not like singapore where your halal food boleh dapat at food court you can dapat your halal food at a hawker centres which are all semua dekat dekat boleh jalan so there the
their are halal food ah is different different locations and you have to go and find it in orang jepun they don't really speak english so kalau nak berbual you probably have to use ah the app google translate to help you out
oh the place I went mana eh I went to their
uh tokyo so tokyo was tokyo honestly dia macam singapore lah macam banyak sangat orang it's very crowded it's a very urbanized so if there's other parts of jepun that I would like to visit err I will go further up north
err pergi hokkaido I think hokkaido also lagi tempat dia will be more sejuk and I think the food will be even nicer as well
have to been to pernah pergi tak hokkaido
so I think kalau if you don't want to go jepun another place that I pernah pergi also err south korea like at least south korea you know lah people there dia punya complexion semua cantik-cantik
semua the people there their are complexion all putih-putih and then I think probably I know why now because when I went there their food
is always some kind of err herbal food dia punya makanan is very different from singapore like our singapore diet kita banyak lemak-lemak kita banyak pakai err makanan yang very oily but there in korea their food
and they always like to eat their favorite kimchi so I think their diet really helps them out to for them to look even more kacak and cantik lah actually
oh ya because their their location have err what you call that four seasons but for us in singapore it's just hot all year round because we are located dekat equator
so I mean I'm pretty sure uh countries yang ada four seasons of course their complexion would be even better I mean if you go to ah further up north
places macam err sweden ke or you go to norway or finland if you tengok their completion putih macam letak bedak kind of putih
and err one thing kalau want to talk about uh going on vacation and stuff I think one err important aspect about going to vacation is to naik kapal terbang like honestly I miss
I miss taking all this kapal terbang just to duduk inside the plane and then below you look out the window you can see the clouds you among the clouds and that
in a roller coaster when the plane dah nak takeoff atau the plane about to land I think that's why now COVID err introduce the
dining in the parked aeroplane like macam banyak orang nak pergi tapi dia punya pricing I would say to me is a bit expensive like you are eating
I think the cheapest one for the economy class is two hundred two hundred dollar plus just to be eating in a parked plane and sitting in the tempat economy
so maybe I will decide nak tengok nak pergi ke tak but probably not maybe you just want to sit the aeroplane and that's probably the closest thing lah that you can get to travelling during this
err COVID situation will you go for this err parked err makan
and also I think the the tickets for the business class and first class if I'm not wrong lah is about six hundred plus if I'm not wrong and honestly kalau nak fikir pasal six hundred plus I think that six hundred plus I can use
for better purposes six hundred plus I can use it for a staycation kat sentosa ke or I can use that money for
I can use that for better purpose as an anyway since we are coming to december dah nak dekat
I would wait for the hundred dollars tourism voucher lah to use it and spend and help to revive the economy because I mean since orang kat luar cannot come in so obviously we are the ones who have to
next week kau start ni kan apa ah volunteer eh
kat mana ni kau pergi where is it
orientation online macam mana what like what a lot of you meet macam gitu
ya lah this kind of volunteering betul betul betul betul betul I'm sure you can find something that you can do best you know macam that will fit you punya
chinese new year I think uh end jan apa
selalunya selalunya kan end jan
entah copywriting ya exactly maybe they should they will definitely make you guys to macam go on the ground isn't it macam distribute stuff no ah kau tak penat ke but they might ask you to do that no like be on the ground
penat ke apa engkau ke you know like you got to
how the hell would I know abeh macam you have to go on the ground like what if they ask you to like okay you go to the homes and distribute stuff
ya they volunteer because I'm I'm one of the uh volunteers right so aku my my my volunteering with them is really fostering ah so I'm a rather than you know uh
it's a shelter the dogs are in kan kan is a shelter it's over at west we're actually quite close to what tengah ya tengah ya we are very close it's it's just next to choa chu kang ya like we're very close to so they have people they have volunteers at the shelter itself so that means the volunteers must go to the shelter uh that involves dog walking
err cleaning really literally like cleaning the you know the poo poo ya ya and then uh there are volunteers such as ambassadors such as what I mean like macam they have events they have events like okay then there is an event here at this uh uh at this uh area at one raffles place so they have like a booth or two booths you know and then they need somebody to to to to to man the merchandise table and another one is to macam
uh macam orang lalu-lalang kan then you macam talk about the awareness gitu lah which I wouldn't mind doing actually uh tapi sekarang uh we don't get enough as a volunteer I don't get the notifications anymore because I think they stopped that lah for being like you said lah because of the COVID ya so they're not so you know they can't go out in the open anymore for now
dog walker boleh lah cuma only you and the dogs tapi macam public all this awareness sort of stuff uh no not so much now I think later they will probably do it I used to get uh emails pasal unit unit ambassadors and all that tapi now no more
ambassadors macam you you you macam you at the booth and you wear punya t-shirt uh you're next to the merchandise punya table sell the merchandise and then of course the donations punya uh apa ni uh tin tu kan and then then you talk to people about okay this is what we do uh this is what we do as an and these are the cases macam gitu awareness of uh what does and how they can help oh they also have social uh pre-corporate social responsibility punya programs companies punya tu
so then you can do that uh they can say oh we need we need volunteers for to do the ambassador part and all that ya so of course they have different volunteer ada volunteer macam photography
macam to be a volunteer photographer to take pictures of their animals for their adoption drive for their website ya you know all the gambar-gambar for the calendars so regular they need uh you know volunteers photography web design web designer of course fosterers a lot lah I'm one of them
which I'm fostering for kucing I volunteer to be a foster for critical care
fosterer for puppies macam gitu so when they have cases then they contact you say okay wati we have this then
exactly kesian kan
you know lah kan international kan kan nama international punya brand kan so orang pun ada lah you know macam kasih donation gitu ada lah I think I guess they do have you know uh
uh but at the end of the day they still run on donations only which is quite sad uh kita punya G O V takde kasih apa-apa
dia orang eh ini binatang-binatang kita orang tau daripada negeri ini mesti lah jaga sikit
ah that is the masalahnya tu
oh I think must there has to be some uh apa ni uh macam caretaking of all or all inhabitants but of course we're certainly the portion is not lah macam of course the priority is to be citizens in a way as in proportionate you know but
areas not all these wooded areas you know these these areas bukit batok lah banyak banyak macam jungle jungle apa they are clearing all the forests and the stray dogs are coming out you don't know bukit batok has a lot of stray dogs ya and they are the stray dogs are coming out from the jungle areas and where are they going to go they are being pushed out right from other developments where are they going to go then they are going into the uh estates like now so then of course who is going to get panicky residents residents are going to complain uh authorities come in take the dogs and cull them which is very inhumane so ideally what you should happen is if you are going to develop the land which I know you probably should have to but then there has to be contingency plan where you going to drive the animals out  you know is like I feel it is not thought through out you know okay we're going to develop the land we're going to end up pushing the animals that are in there they are going to end up going to hello resident areas so why don't we do something about that two pronged approach
tengah mm mm mm
of course they know they know they see it we they see it all the time and dogs are coming out punggol pasir ris choa chu kang but there also but also yes the wild boar of course is in the news and everything how can they not know but are they doing anything no they are not the second part is the second part is they are not this is why we are frustrated we go like why don't you do something help we are not telling you to do it one hundred percent because we are completely we understand that they are completely incompetent but takde collaboration kau faham tak takde supportive effort at all macam okay kau okay kita sekarang kita punya and animal welfare groups okay why don't we support you into doing this you know what I mean kita nak buat macam gitu macam okay kita dia orang because dia orang uh yang boleh ambil I mean they are the ones with the expertise the heart the passion all that but they cannot be run they they cannot do all because they have no space and duit takde duit kan so siapa yang ada duit ni yang itu kan government kan so at least macam okay kita tolong collaborate lah you know uh okay uh kita buat ni then you all can uh kita boleh kasih kau orang support sikit-sikit untuk blah blah blah you know this is exactly what should happen but it's not happening so apa yang buat sekarang is bila binatang ni keluar yang gahmen gahmen ni semua angkat tangkap bunuh it's like it's an inhumane approach you know what I mean ya itu yang kita boring
ya lah tapi not to this extent not to this extent look at tengah now tengah baru tengah is now being developed which means they are they are accelerating and intensifying the development so now the animals are getting pushed out last time the animals are not getting pushed out so much because tengah is still around correct lim chu kang sekarang semua nak development punggol mana ada punggol dulu dulu mana ada waterway punggol sekarang dah ada punggol apa all the dogs from punggol are coming out you can you can literally walk on punggol street with the traffic light and there's like a pack of stray dogs dulu mana ada because punggol was not developed that's why the the problem is highlighting is being highlighted now because wah dogs are coming out what how come people people are like how come there are so many dogs because they have been around but just that they have been developing they are getting pushed out they have the dogs have been around in there in the jungles people I know people who go around and feed the dogs at the edges of the forest because the dogs are coming out you know you they know why these people go to feed them at the edges is because they are trying to prevent the dogs from coming into estates because it will be that will spell danger for the dogs you know the dogs people are going to complain people are going to complain the the dogs are going to be in danger so but the dogs are hungry so people now the feeders go to the edges to feed them and the dogs are you know they are wild dogs they're feral dogs but they are very smart and they very and they really harmless because all they want is food they're not interested to go down to the to your heartlands and do what whatever you know they just want food so the people the feeders there go to the edges feed them then they go back inside the the jungles they are very sweet you know but
the wild boar pun sama
betul exactly aku nak salahkan wild boar tu macam mana kesian pula so this is exactly what we are ini macam frustration lah kan
no gatal kau tengok aku punya ni rashes tapi aku memang sensitive skin
kau kulit kulit buaya
kau takde macam ni cover ni kan ni kan
abeh ada tulis arab ah
kena saman there's no such thing
I don't know about the saman part I know you that you kena saman if you litter
we tell people don't put up food water because the dengue and then particularly doesn't like that because dengue apa
you know they because they have they have a certain route right okay block this block I feed three cats eat eat eat feed feed feed feed makan makan makan ah dah habis okay bye bye clear
and then I go to the next block some people do that or some feeders they will just from one block X they walk to they leave the food then they go to block Y Z then they balik then patah balik dia orang patah balik then clear lah
kalau tidak it is considered littering
entah littering lah whatever the charge is whatever the sum is hundred dollars I don't know
town councils town councils um cat welfare society ya ya usually cat welfare society collaborate with town council and they put a sign lah dekat kat lift landing you know uh please keep clear within two hours macam gitu macam posters
bagus lah
block mana this block this block
kesian kan
macam back to macam back to nature eh
scout does I thought dia bawa kawan dia
ni depan ni eh
kesian eh
away from all the orang-orang
ya eh masa
macam what bila aku dekat uh botanic gardens aku kerja kat situ oh my god the otters came all the time and they were huge my god they are like
oh they have a certain route all my colleagues will go off first at ten o'clock they will be here and then after that you can find them dia orang macam ada very designated they like know where to go first first then second twelve o'clock you will see them there is like
uh I guess because botanic gardens kan ada lakes kan ada lakes ada eco lake swan lake and all the macam the stream stream stream and you know botanic gardens
the the the park rangers make sure that the animals don't get disturbed you know so uh when there are otters we tell people me when I was located you know like me when I was located no please please stay aside you know make sure ya we basically monitored people's behaviours so uh the the we were policing the people for the otters the otters I guess felt safe macam ada bodyguard
ya dah macam they were protected ya which is a nice thing you know and but it's so nice to see them they were so cute huge though oh my god the biggest one I swear I swear it was like that I was like when I saw I was like my god it's huge ya they're very big
because singapore there are a few a few families of otters they're not no they're few families dia macam different clans
are you cray cray are you kidding me they are different ya there are different families macam different hello macam macam tigers kan lions kan ada different pride
sini ada so they have the kallang clan the kallang one which is like the the family that lives ya alah kau baca lah dalam surat khabar you know the otter city the otter the otters are being watched by their fan club
ya they are macam a'ah they macam the hobbies gitu
ah yes they are watching the birds the ah okay yes macam gitu
mana ya alah of course lah they look the same mana lah aku tahu macam mana rupa dia orang but they are these these people are the experts right they they like okay that belongs to the kallang clan
uh so the kallang clan otters are the ones that hang out in the kallang area dia macam territorial lah
maybe they are another clan but then again you know yang dekat yang dekat kallang tu wah I tell you
uh or the ones yang pergi kau tak baca dia masuk kat
ah gitu dengan tu that one is one clan know
ya eh dekat bishan park bishan park pun ada tau
you know macam they have a certain it's just like cats and dogs and lions and all that this is their roaming this is their range
uh this is their territory kau masuk dalam territory dia orang boleh bergaduh
dia orang bukan macam um some canines some felines yang after a while they have to separate you know so I don't think so that's why you call it a family great technique family
I think uh tempat fishing punya people who are not allowed to fish but they still fish there
I think kallang I think one of the anglers one of them the babies got stuck the hook mati tau so sad
they macam they go to their mana aku tahu dia orang pergi mana but they have their own spare trait lah kalau kau macam pergi dekat kallang river side I'm sure there is you can see them I told you botanic gardens they do botanic gardens
to be honest aku tak ingat sejak bila when is the first time they came out but otters ni tapi uh
uh both apa ni uh I don't know I don't know I don't remember when aku nak kencing I don't remember exactly when I don't remember exactly apa apasal aku toilet what do you mean I come back lah
ya cakap jer but I don't remember exactly when the otters um
uh I don't remember exactly when the otters you know keluar but definitely at least uh you know five years I think
bila bila aku start perasan ni lah when I first started you know noticed the news ah not noticed the orchards okay noticed the news
masa kampung babe masa kampung-kampung dulu kan ada sungai-sungai otters nak pergi nak buat apa sekarang they're all where are they going to go
sama lah sama lah
these people these okay these animals are native so when they started ya ya they are native they are you know also they're from we have mangrove apa dekat sungei buloh tu kan so I guess they decided to jalan keluar jauh sikit lor
not care taking not care taking no no ya ya ya ya ya ya they are not it's not care taking but they care for them in the sense that they care for their welfare they will do uh they will do um macam awareness macam don't feed the otters do not go near them don't
you know if you see them stay away don't don't provoke don't apa apa you know so they do that sort of message they carry that sort of message but of course depending on the context lah these are otters so you know so when they say we say they care for them means they will like they know oh they come out at this time so they know their habits they know how many of them
you know they might even have names I don't know ya so there's this group uh this you know quite a sizable number of their fan club that actually know them that knows them well well enough to know that this one belongs to this and there are like seven adults and two babies meh ya you know from a distance I guess they record which is kau tahu macam
macam macam the ornithologist yang tengok-tengok observe the birds and they will also all these these clans but they don't necessarily take care of them right in that sense
you know the otters in the city wow can you imagine you are at bloody then otters that's like wow what a nice sight of course of course ya ya ya but you know ya because they are like macam unlikely sight
ya mana ya pythons ya pythons and then they ate the cats and all that ya there's one there's one recently uh couple of two months ago maybe one snake over at entah bukit merah or what the snake ate the cat the com cat
ya all these com cats kat bawah it's the natural predator apa natural hello this is a cats snake hungry ya so they ate been a few cases where the cats ate the snakes is it com cat
less and less what forest yes yes exactly so we are driving them out so the snakes are eating the com cats already quite a few com cats already mati because of these the snake pernah ada satu ada satu gambar ada satu gambar yang snake tu yang snake tu tengah com cat dekat depan dekat mak news ah snake com cat ah
okay so ya dia nuts he was carrying the table and then after that the the slot just doesn't go in mengamuk ah then I don't understand it's like julie was trying to tell him to just carry the thing out just carry the table out like which I said then he was like no no no no cannot carry because the thing is not locked I was like sudah lah just angkat jer lah he wants to have the table locked jadi dia punya tu a catch under the table I know right that's a assault ya allah lepas tu bising-bising I don't get it tapi si julie macam just angkat jer lah kau then kita tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh like lock lock
hello who's that okay so ya ya so what's the story about the makcik seth ya
bodoh nak mamps
I told my friend about him then he's like oh oh oh okay he doesn't know her but like macam bodoh sekali then I was like saying no bodoh is an understatement this is really beyond bodoh B B but I don't know

dia tak ada laki what
dia punya application tak taruk ya but she admitted it just now and her second application she will just put

ted bundy pun influencer
tapi lifestyle dia orang tapi lifestyle dia orang gerek pe
like more than a hundred thousand subs lah not not that I do or I care lah but macam sekarang
talking to them talking to them very talking about them very poorly lah macam
kau ambil kesempatan kan untuk bual
untuk bual dengan mengumpat orang mengumpat pasal orang then
kau mengumpat mengumpat mengumpat then
you know that you you didn't prepare contingency plan lah furthermore also macam everybody
tapi kau kau pandai kau pandai sangat kan
this kind of content eh the macam
gossipping eh to me right is macam is very normal you know guys gossip

habis macam they have the drama and then people are not supposed to know about this drama you know but they
then dia orang punya pasal lah then dia orang punya pasal lah then you want to comment right fine lah you can comment you can fine lah you can go ahead
at times right macam I feel that it's err
err from what I know lah macam he made a video like reviewing her reviewing her work
so macam then
look at how macam she got reviewed and all that I mean okay I
to me right to me eh the only wrong right they only wrong eh yang the you only wrong that
if in my very humble opinion lah the only wrong yang dia buat kan is
like my also eh also apasal budak-budak zaman sekarang kan you guys are so drawn right to simple stupid shit
okay is because you all budak-budak zaman sekarang right love nonsense eh like TikTok and
okay if that was the case right can you tell me ah agak-agak kan
what kind of orang kan is selalu buat benda macam ni
what type of what type of what type of orang
like the fact you right the fact is macam
male err like these YouTube celebrities right that's why or like ridhwan right because macam I don't see any of the things that they do right macam
applicable to my life useful in useful useful in my life right or macam I don't see them possessing any characteristics right which I as a man right can look up to and respect ah
although the err macam at fate
manlier than I'm manlier than they are then macam like
what skills that do that they possess what skills do they possess right macam
that's really macam
macam that's really important
but they are not really that funny and then look at their target demographic ah their their target demographic right is macam
is err those macam budak err those macam budak-budak belum sunat gitu

like really tak kisah like the people and that's where the the people always lose out yes your business is thriving you are in the top number one in the world whatever whatever it's like your business and all that is thriving and all that you're earning billions got a lot of reserve and
you the minah that's very bising
why would I wash my selimut
um there's a lot of animes I like to watch I I'm a anime fan lah so Netflix surprisingly dorang macam makin banyak anime dorang masuk-masukkan kan I was like wah quite quite amazed though sebab dulu Netflix there's not much anime
you still hype dia masih ada serious serious because right now um the movie just came out abeh macam
all all of us uh kita pergi tengok movie dia kan
there are some of our friends also dorang masih belum tengok
and also tak salah aku the season two pun belum keluar kalau kau belum
ah kau baru nak start the hype you still ah don't have to wait so long for the season two
but don't I don't know I I feel like you should wait for season two come out sebab tadi aku baru dapat tahu season two possibly dorang akan keluar like
ya Netflix it came out ah slow but it came out came out right april tak salah april twenty twenty that's when the hype betul-betul naik ah sia and apa everytime
like uh there's some macam
apa eh I read cause I think it release per episode or maybe the whole thing at once but because of that ah the popularity really skyrocketed man and and also err dia nya manga because normally mangas like macam for example you know the big three of anime the one piece bleach uh naruto
dorang punya like the amount of copies that they kan
berapa lama eh tak salah aku one piece is nineteen ninety seven out like okay lah this is just a rough gauge all of them ah took like at least ten years plus to reach at least hundred million copies
untuk demon slayer for the manga aje eh
dia wah it's only four years ah
dah hundred and twenty million dah
with drums ah ah tapi pasal kan tu ah japanese kan kita melayu kita kita kompang
masuk masuk rumah kau selamat hari raya eh asal bilik-bilik semua tukar-tukar eh
ya the like what they say ah apa actions speak louder than words
that is exactly how apa gui is ah as a person
ah tapi
dia nya other than the anime
um apa soundtrack dia kan
because one thing about uh anything in general ah kalau kau tengok a show or something kan
it is more emotional kalau dia nya soundtrack is a very macam it's a good it's a good soundtrack it can relate to you like how demon slayer sekarang the one thing people can relate to at first is the song
the by sung by lisa yang the opening
and pasal
that it becomes like everyday object everyday ah actions are sampai they don't know ah they can't determine what is right or wrong anymore but wah it's
for all the animes ah I watch semua ikut yang this dua puluh minit dua puluh minit dua puluh minit tapi ada yang
macam aku rasa like one shot there's this thing called one shot animes dorang usually macam forty plus minutes abeh dah tu jer
dia macam a short a short film ah kirakan but it the sometimes like
orang fikir like oh the longer the anime is the better it will be but some people might not know actually the the quality of how you
tell a story in in a in a film is what matters ah kadang-kadang even like those thirty or ten minute films kan it leaves a very
uh everlasting mark in your in your memory macam tak boleh lupakan it's that good ah like the story storytelling even uh the soundtrack cause come on man ah without soundtrack anything will be boring lah
it's okay man it's okay aku nya A math pun
bila entah eh macam there's this kind of stigma ah whenever you go to school or like university ah in that case
so whenever you go to university you have that certain feeling that macam kau rasa kau rasa bodoh
ah I I shared this with my one of my friends ah dia pun tengah ambil university but I think is like I think ya so ya ah bro that one is just that's just one person lah don't don't let it bring bad image to the school man
especially kalau kau buat coding atau math kan there's definitely
tend to be like some parts where macam oh wait what's going on I don't understand sia and then you have to seek for help from other people it's not it's not the same as like poly atau atau secondary school tau
sebab mak aku english teacher
ya and also macam being an introvert you you have this certain set of skill it's called err from what I learn in psychology like different people have different
like err apa tu there's this thing called intrapersonal skill that's it that is huh
macam apa sia dia ni like asal asal ah kecil hati exactly and like some people might not know like whatever they do right if people don't give them feedback like eh don't don't be so abrupt don't be so macam rude ah kalau dorang tak ada orang cakap gini kan the person who speak all those abrupt words or macam kasar kan dia tak akan rasa apa-apa dia fikir macam oh ni semua ah normal lah takde orang cakap apa-apa [pe] so I'll just continue with what I'm doing ah
adapting and also apa eh what's that word again uh you have to manage your time ya time management is the utmost priority in a university life
abeh kalau your
then kau akan dapat suspension
ah kau ah eh sorry
after one year then kau kena re-enroll
um when you are in a academic warning punya ni ah ya
if you haven't get academic warning then asalkan your is not lesser than two point O or maybe one point eight then you're still save lah
ada is that macam kau nya topic bukan topic apa module module is that module macam
kau nak kena belajar pasal another language
like macam malay atau mandarin
orh is it the same as macam
ada benda kita nak kena reverse the structure of a of a word
kalau english post office abeh melayu pejabat post dia dia dia macam reverse ah it's in that that way ah like buat orang macam confusing
pejabat post
oh like apa dialects ah slang slang
because of that they also update the name of the course to fit in with all the macam
ah baru-baru punya module yang apa nak nak kena ajar like aku rasa for example like
uh in the market I guess one thing yang
macam banyak-banyak tukar is the job finding
kalau let's say err user experience kan
normally macam tak banyak kerja pasal user experience mah because it's not that known to be uh to be like a proper job orang fikir macam alah ni orang lain buat boleh buat pe macam it's another job
on top of the job that orang tengah buat but now it's a good thing that they realise user experience is the most important thing in anything in games in apps in like even in everyday object macam kau pegang cawan
the user experience is for you to hold the cup right abeh kau imagine kalau they handle ada duri tak comfortable and that's the user experience it's a ergonomics err the the design of the cup that makes your experience in holding the cup
even though macam it sounds so simple but it actually helps to make it feel good
macam kau tengah bad mood abeh kau pegang cawan abeh duri kau kau tak rasa
like err happiness like for example kau nak dapat macam aku nak kerja
abeh kau rasa macam eh how am I gonna get to that level so kau kau uh bertungkus-lumus kau uh cari-cari kerja banyak banyak banyak and that process buat kau bad mood
some people dorang dah so into earning money
that their greed is imposed onto them to make more money walaupun dorang banyak duit tapi dorang masih nak lebih
ya they are tuned to that mind mindset macam oh since I have this much money and it gives me a lot of happiness because it can allow me to buy the things that I have wanted since I was a kid
like kau imagine ah like he said in two years eh
cam rezeki akan di diberikan like don't focus always on the rezeki focus on like
what make things work in in the last time ah macam retrospect ah but for now it's more like
which is why I appreciate like all those people yang even though it's just ah comic books or like anime kan it brings certain joy to you like you feel you feel
ah for this anime macam all these one
that's why like ah apa eh ya macam demon slayer like the like what you said the experience then it's the user experience lah the soundtrack visual effects graphics and the characters storyline all that takes into account of the whole topic of user experience
it's happening in in that macam ah alternate universe lah in a way ah ya Marvel cinematic universe
so what I like about Marvel is dorang they apa
dorang suka letak macam orang-orang biasa dalam the movie walaupun that movie ada banyak orang macam superpower kan tapi dorang buatkan character tu macam he goes through everyday life as per normal but uh they somehow macam in a turn of events they stumble upon something which made them into a superhero of some sort even though ada orang dorang tak ada ah superpower tapi a certain grudge or a certain bond towards something yang buatkan kau macam strongly
uh huh game of thrones oh tak eh
tell you about it like macam eh macam orang gemuk like they want to achieve being slim like have that ah that the beach body
and because of that people like the the process is long but people who rarely meet you when they meet you after like a few months something like that then they will say like eh dah kurus eh sia baik [pe] but actually kau kau tak tahu like the process itself buatkan kau nak slim kau belum habis tapi pasal orang cakap macam eh kau dah kurus kan
ya it motivates you even though it's not it's not the like you haven't reach your optimal uh weight your optimal image tapi the
the thought of people macam dorang perasan like kau tengah berubah at least macam you looking more slim or looking more ah toned your body looks so toned then kau you'll feel better and it helps to
tapi it's it's I guess this little happiness macam kalau nak go back to what I said earlier like the little happiness buat kau macam maintain your course cause ada orang let's say pasal yang language one aku pun tengah another language is called C sharp programming language
for this different generations like sejak okay ah this past few hundred years ah there has been certain developments in uh certain parts of uh humanity like last time there's uh agriculture industrial evolution kan then there's uh
I learned this programming it might be useful or it might be very useful for me in the future if aku tengah cari kerja ke atau kalau macam
aku nak keep up to date to certain things jadi macam I'm not
uh losing in the race for finding jobs atau uh skill sets so
aku push myself ah I push myself to learn the programming but sometimes kalau kau buat benda sorang like what I said being an introvert is not a good thing if you want to seek for help
especially if you okay lah probably yang buatkan kau malu is kalau macam kau buat buat buat abeh kau rasa macam eh ni aku takyah tanya orang kau aku assume that walaupun susah but aku I can just Google apa Google is there for me to help boleh search senang-senang takyah kacau orang yang nak buat kerja dorang sendiri
uh the the amid the Google search yang kau buat
so you'd have to nit pick some things properly for it to work kalau tak kan kalau kau ikut jer it will definitely not work
like if they are not happy with the game like your target audience macam budak-budak lima tahun sepuluh tahun kan kalau kau buat game macam five dorang main ke I mean
ya like okay kalau aku ah nak aim for
apa budak-budak yang dorang tak tahu belajar like tiga tahun empat tahun ah not not not not tak tahu belajar I mean tak tahu tak tahu buat math like aku bagi dorang game pasal math tapi ah dia nya macam quizzes aku bagi chemistry
lari kan that's why err that target audience is the most important thing when kau buat game macam untuk kau eh best sia game ni ada chemistry tapi kau tak tahu actually your audience is yang orang yang nak belajar pasal math
like iron man okay ni ni ni betul-betul uh off track
ah ironman like even though he's a millionaire but he's damn smart lah like he might be one of the inspiration where aku will continue programming because
scenario kalau orang betul-betul don't have that drive to make suits to make all these right there is a possible future that we can aim for so aku rasa like programming is a
apa eh
that's why aku really appreciate what elon musk has been doing now
I mean they will have a controlled environment macam uh dia nya apa tu
apa tu ah udara udara dia macam ada dekat dalam this sphere abeh kalau ada ikut macam earth punya udara inside that sphere aku rasa everything should be fine kalau orang kena tanam ke apa there might be a proper grave for them cuma
it's weird lah it it's weird ah cause tak pernah dengar orang ah eh mana kubur kau bukan kau ah mana kubur apa nenek kau ke apa oh dekat mars ah aku nak merawat
naik spaceship but that is a possible future also like kalau let's say when elon musk dia cakap uh human will be planetary existence in in the universe so imagine kalau you have your own spaceship macam kereta sekarang but kau nya spaceship kau imagine macam eh aku nak pergi ah moon jap kau nak makan ah moon burger eh boleh ah kita gi makan sekarang K jap aku ambil spaceship aku
ya abeh kau ah fly ah okay ah ni set ah to moon then dia nya spaceship kau cakap okay uh ten minutes ride okay
abeh kadang-kadang pasal ni sekarang Grab pe so kau call uh space Grab
unless bila mars dah ada a way to like
maybe the thought of that like macam aku tahu aku tak mati so buat apa aku buat kerja ni semua you become complacent
then kau complacent then then there's no progress in life lah macam semua dah convenient untuk kau [pe] or aku boleh ah aku boleh tengok anime hari-hari aku tahu aku takkan mati pe so takyah belajar ah takyah belajar apa takyah mandi cause whatever it is even even though I am smelly or even though how much I don't brush my teeth
makes humanity not to deserve to have a um apa eternal life
but not the things like macam sekarang kau masih hidup abeh kau buat benda macam bagus macam eh dia ni bagus sia okay dah tu jer ah abeh kalau macam for example kalau michael jackson
dia buat buat lagu semua macam okay lah kalau dia tak mati it's still there ah tapi bila he died at at the time when he's still popular
so that makes his popularity increase because macam oh a legend it has it is a legend because
so imagine if like ah the apa eh
the same goes for ni ah the the the football legend
macam eh dia ada buat aku susah but
ya so okay lah takpe lah eh banyak time ah ni tak banyak time sorry
lagi apa eh
untuk err buka business yang
sewa itu agak tinggi juga sekolah sewa canteen itu murah lah
ya lah tapi masalah dia
err yang
uh dia dia sekarang dia tahu masak dia pandai masak
ya boleh masak lah tapi
and those kind of things lah macam nasi putih nasi
err jadi saya kena belajar masak dulu lah baru saya boleh buka
sebab because at schools they have err
so kita kena jual benda yang sama
canteen they they cakap they ada
business lain so dia
dia tak ada masa nak jaga dekat situ lah because
so tapi
sekarang now we are
saya tahu lah apa itu kalau tak ada
ya mm maksud saya yang my first wish yang anak-anak jadi baik itu
bukan baik I mean it's baik overall lah it's good
ya so kalau
err tak ada lah tak ingat
with these variations I I I'm a bit like macam old fashioned lah
masa saya pergi india dulu
err ada saya ingat ada satu pak cik
like macam senapang tau
err tapi dia pergi macam
uh paddy field itu ada banyak burung
burung the one
err apa itu yang warna putih itu yang kaki dia panjang itu apa nama dia
so this pakcik
err will go then they they suka hunt these birds
then they bawa
they bawa then people with cook the meat
err but dia punya daging dia agak it's not soft like chicken tapi agak keras juga lah tapi I only remember I had that once
ya itu sahaja saya try
ya tapi sekarang masa itu saya kecil
sekarang now I'm grown up
bukan itu bukan maksud itu err macam jalan-jalan travel saya tak kisah I'm talking about food
food means all food I'm okay with all food except like macam
um saya boleh rasa macam okay just to taste lah once or twice but I will not make it like my daily consumption kind of thing tak ada
yes harap-harap corona ini over lah so we all can
okay let's say I I tengok satu jam atau dua jam
tapi saya saya err I'm
I sekarang saya suka yang not drag too much
story macam dia punya like short stories lah
macam yang err dia punya
kisah itu habis dalam masa let's say for one dalam one hour two hour tak drag drag drag sampai you know for few episodes ah macam itu saya tak ada patience nak tengok macam
ya it's short I mean apa itu orang cakap apa eh
ya macam itu semua saya suka lah
bila eh
oh twenty twenty three they keluar
macam like um I I also like all the superhero movies
no it's not that aku tak suka cuma I didn't err saya tak you know I didn't sit
the most I I think I watch will be spiderman lah yang banyak
yang saya tengok itu mungkin spiderman tak banyak sangat
bukan lah maybe that's what it's uh
so uh saya nak tanya eh
so you after your sekolah kan after your course you want to work where nak kerja dekat mana
yang itu hari err
yang sofian buat what internship itu it's research more to research right
so you pergi
kan sekarang cuti sekolah
tapi uh you mean
tapi yang you
err punya classmate yang dekat A level itu
ada ambil civil civil engineering
no bukan after A level ada your friends take the same course
so um sofian nak
if if you are considering higher education mana awak nak belajar singapore ke overseas
tak boleh lah mana boleh buat apa susah-susah belajar ini then go
ajar budak primary
itu lah saya nak like I said
nak buka business
kalau tak another option would be like macam work from home lah
mah do something like ecommerce ke
normal macam demam macam the normal you know cold flu things no I don't want that for free
err macam you know unexpected
err bayangkan kalau orang itu tak ada duit
then memang orang itu dah stress because of the illness
ya so kalau dia tak ada duit
I wish lah if orang yang macam
so they get I think government ada juga lah bagi untuk orang yang tak mampu tapi I wish they
ya itu maybe we can
tapi yang macam chronically ill and the bill is like very high how
itu satu err swimming sebab sekarang saya tengah belajar swimming
err dekat itu
err apa
ya sebab err coach itu boleh datang
mm dia punya tempat dia ajar itu dekat situ
I mean uh last time saya pernah ada juga pergi
tapi coach itu walaupun dia bagi tiga ratus dollar untuk sepuluh lessons
tapi the coach is like uh not hands on he he
just a coach just expect us to do on our own mm but this one even though we pay four lessons hundred seventy seven tapi each lesson itu
ada dia punya itu lah result
so um berenang itu
because sekarang saya banyak sekarang saya umur empat puluh lima
so sekarang
your you know like macam
ada pilates
satu jam is it a group class
dekat mana jurong
ya yang ini pilates saya bukan cari yang
yang pilates itu ada banyak macam ada banyak jenis yang
with our body just on the mat the yoga mat itu
tapi ada lagi yang pakai equipments
active itu saya kena check kalau dia orang ada the same kind of pilates
kalau ada uh ya obviously I go for that
active belum
saya pernah pakai untuk swimming pool sahaja pernah
no yang saya cakap itu dulu
itu dekat redhill
so far lah because the coach um yang coach can only come there
ya like I said dulu punya coach itu
the coach uh tapi sekarang punya coach itu
at least ada lah ajar sikit-sikit but I know I would I will take with some
sekarang saya punya itu package remain one more lessons only
no bread toast is just I like lah but not mm not I eat something that I eat rest of my life tapi kalau macam
like macam
kalau nak cakap macam gitu apa eh
ah saya tak tahu lah awak
maggi mee
the nasi arab itu

then it will you know dia akan hilang cepat
itu bukan keras lah itu
ya tak tak tapi
pizza dekat mana
err you need a little bit of minyak sapi
err depends lah if you want to put it all minyak sapi or you can mix with other oils like any other vegetable oil half half
you boleh you boleh letak rempah-rempah dia like kayu manis buah pelaga is
bunga lawa tapi jangan taruh banyak lah because it's only one cup of rice
then cengkih is clove
macam daun salam is basil leaves basil leaves also can put one
err you letak garam
garam then when it when the
water starts to boil you letak itu beras
err nasi minyak you are talking about nasi minyak right
uh nasi minyak kalau ikutkan cara sini
all water they will mix with half half like susu cair
half susu cair half water
no nasi lemak kita letak santan
this is nasi minyak
ya nasi minyak you can also do that way but the taste will be a bit lah
mm then you boleh letak daun pandan daun serai
you know that one is a different taste but if you like it you can do that way also macam you boleh letak tomato
you uh boleh letak chilli hijau semua lah then you put half half lah separuh
uh then the same method you put the uh garam
the other one the taste will be macam kenduri punya nasi lemak lah
ya that one is more like uh is uh more with it goes well with like macam ayam masak merah rendang semua
ya ini nasi minyak simple punya so it goes well with uh curry chicken
ya so you try to make it so maybe you can kau boleh masak dekat sekolah
you punya sekolah itu boleh pakai
you you boleh bawa itu uh
is like it acts like macam bila you nak masak soup with I mean like maggi
boleh nasi boleh lauk pun boleh you only need that one pot which call magic pot I don't know

so lagi satu tahun ah
banyak commitment
okay ah jom kita tengok
hmm macam
pada I semua makanan sedap so semua memorable
um kalau satu eh
terduduk right or like if I makan curry cause I tak suka sangat tau makan curry right so kalau makan curry right then confirm sometimes I will think about the bunny chow ah macam mengidam
basically curry dalam roti satu bantal roti sebantal roti
and then curry kat dalam
ya I know I cause like kita order kita nampak gambar tu that's why kita order kan
so tapi macam I think yang kenapa like
tempat the tempat itself
like orang-orang dia semua macam
chill right like dorang nampak kita macam kawan baik padahal tak pernah jumpa and then I think cause also not a lot of people cause it wasn't a meal time
tempat orang tourist kan
terus tak ada orang then kita jer
food adventure day so macam
kita makan tu lepas tu kita gi makan was it a burger
cause also we had no money but kita nak makan banyak
ya nak kena agak-agak
agak-agak lah
oh aku ingat seh aku ingat McDonald's
I remember the McDonald's pasal
aku saja jer keluarkan chili packet um
I ada gambar I think
satu benda tu macam ah roti dalam dia daging
it's like roti prata dalam gulung gulung daging
kari daging or something like that is it
oh ada nasi
macam nasi briyani tapi tu tengah tengah dia cheese eh apa eh
cheese dengan daging ah
ah tu nasi
daging dengan cheese ke something lah putih there right it was a
ya then cause melayu dorang bukan macam melayu kita ah cause their malay is mainly they came from indonesia ya and then
oh I aku tahu err there's something else kita cuba um apa benda tu yang roti
itu jer eh roti yang is also from the malay apa the melayu the cake malay site no remember we went driving like I think on my birthday or something we went driving in that area
so that no it wasn't bo-kaap it was like a different side of cape town and then we drove there specifically for that particular roti
what was the roti called
okay so the roti is like ah roti perancis panjang gitu kan and then after that dia potong setengah lepas tu dia taruk macam you nak taruk daging ke nak taruk ayam
ya but it's like a very very long roti perancis right
sayur right and vegetable
ya then we no we then okay so we had the whole roti perancis and then they asked us whether you want the full you know like Subway like foot long or half right and then we were like ya we want full and then so he was okay so you want two
ah terus kita nak masuk kan ice box pun tak berani
tu lepas tu tak ada microwave
so kita macam
nak buat apa ni eh so I remember satu satu malam kita tinggalkan kat tepi kat atas meja betul tak
uh it was like I think we ate like like for lunch and dinner on that day we ate only half of that roti perancis betul tak
and then the next then the next roti perancis
front that roti we even half it again right so it was like one quarter so we ate the one quarter then the one quarter and another one quarter so it's like four four four meals ya but I think
no it's ya sedap
then the other day I tengok then there's I think someone was also at
the freaking roti perancis
um was we wanted to go to the hill remember kita there was like
hari kedua kan kita dah sampai okay so we sampai kat cape town then we already checked in and everything then the next day
so kita lah macam ghairah kan konon banyak tenaga so kita orang macam okay the next day ya
masih muda that was how many three years ago only
so like the next day we were like okay even though we're jet-lagged kita nak pergi we know tak nak buang masa kita nak terus like jump into all the activities right
so kita pergi
and then the Grab driver was like very nice very friendly talk to us the entire trip okay this was at five or six in the morning can you imagine like we lepas just after we got off and then
ya and then the Grab driver okay so the plan was kita nak panjat itu hill and then after that at the top of the hill then we see the sunrise
right it makes so much sense and people say like to go up the hill it takes like you know half an hour at most so kita macam okay ah boleh ah settle juga ah kan so the then the Grab driver very nice what was his name ah I remember it was something very doug
betul it's like no doug or something doug lah his name I don't know and then and then ya I remember we made a lot of jokes after that no okay anyway so
so the so we told him that we wanted to climb nak tengok sunrise all that and he then he dropped us off at this spot and he said ya a lot of people panjat kat situ they start kat situ then they panjat and then by the time dorang kat atas nampak sunrise so kita macam eh it doesn't look like
the hill or whatever and there's like signs that say climbing blah blah blah so kita okay lah go jer so so kita tak tak pakai benda climbing pun kita pakai jeans kan kita pakai winter coat uh you I remember you were having like the bomber jacket and then we started climbing
tak bersedia langsung we just started and then air pun tak ada I remember
botol air kita ada satu jer botol air right between us there's satu botol air
kasut biasa and then kita ada makanan kita ada aku tahu aku ada bawa gula-gula
you know Daim kan yang chocolate gula-gula something like that
I think there's like berapa gula-gula jer and then after that ya satu botol air okay so we started climbing then masih boleh sempat vlog tau mana video tu pun aku tak tahu pergi
then kita panjat
kita panjat terus dah macam lima belas minit ke dua puluh minit macam masih belum naik eh belum lagi sampai a'ah so kita macam kenapa kenapa macam jauh betul ni ingatkan like all the online say like it's very fast should be okay and then like okay ah
ah puncak dia macam jauh kan
I don't know lah kita dah sampai
go jer ah ikut jer takkan nak stop
a'ah eh tak jauh ah
terus dah dah setengah jam gitu aku ingat kita dua macam dah penat kan terus ada kat ada macam tempat duduk kan then ada bench
then it was like facing the apa the town below so kita macam wah cantik kita pun duduk then kita duduk then kita macam penat terus minum air ah then kita minum air wah macam relax ah konon terus minum air
then by that time also sunrise pun dah naik terus kan kita macam okay don't need see sunrise ah but never mind ah
ya and then I remember kita share gula-gula
apa ni minum air lepas tu dah okay dah nak can continue okay jom continue lagi
continue berapa jam ah dua jam tiga jam dua jam
aku rasa dua jam continue all the way to the top
like seriously siapa panjat all the way tak perasan macam oh go jer
like macam jap jap dah sampai atas gunung
tak like waktu kita tengah panjat pun macam angin dia terlalu kuat kan then the angin
naik kan
ah macam angin dia tengah tolak kita naik so I think that's why kita macam every time kita pass by that part kita macam cepat-cepat naik kan macam go go go go
ya so turns out the hill was like so why the mountain was called lion's head is cause the lion the mountain the the the head it was actually the kepala and then there's signal hill that we wanted to originally to climb was actually the body of this lion
so kita
but the Grab driver didn't see that kita tak pakai baju athletic at all oh okay kita pakai baju lepak nak mampus
oh I remember after when we were going down kan aleh-aleh ada ramai orang naik betul tak so dorang semua tengok kita orang macam kenapa dorang pakai baju macam gini
dengan beg sekolah dengan coat warna biru aku ingat seh coat aku biru macam shiny
your bomber jacket like bright pink bright blue so macam I really going down the mountain like wearing casual clothes and then these mountain people
ya macam
tak puas kan
we all melayu together
you talk all the masjid-masjid
all the masjid
kita ikut macam ada walking tour kan tapi tu kita tak halfway kita macam
kira was cape town itself and then when we went for that safari after the school
the safari so we had so basically lepas kita dah
ya it felt so long right ya like hari-hari ada benda nak buat
weekend kita orang pergi mana
pergi entah lah sekolah bawa gi jalan-jalan kat mana it's like literally weekend trip to a different part of
it was it was very bulgy I think also cause majority of the budak-budak yang ada were budak apa american so like I think they had to up like they wanted to make sure these americans tak complain sangat confirm dorang complain ya
ya so for that after kita dah belajar for the summer programme then we had like this one week plus of safari so kita orang pergi um basically we went up the coast of southern south africa
and then kita ya basically went and look at all
we saw we saw them but like kat reserve like we had to enter a reserve to look at all the wild animals and it's not like a zoo where you know where they are cause you is if you're lucky then you get to see if you're not lucky then you don't get to see
oh there was more than three right four I think empat
sepuluh kot and then macam aku tahu we had to sign up right for the vans and then we had to put our names down for which vans you want to be in
so we sign up we sign up for like the last van cause tak ada orang like no americans wrote their names there I think right so we put names for the last van
ya same tanah air
um ya and then like all the americans already had their cliques and whatever so they dorang taruk nama dorang in the first few vans or whatever you know supposedly it's gonna be like a fun trip for them
and then err at the end of the whole thing we realised yang apa ni orang yang dalam van kita semua macam lebih mature I would say eh and like our van was like the most diverse diverse group of people and we knew we don't really know each other lah sebelum tu when we started the trip
but then by the end of the trip like the vans like the first like the the van yang first first tu semua macam
nanti dorang tak jadi kawan lagi ke apa tau macam at first dorang start off macam ghairah nak mampus macam woo woo woo tapi tu at the end of the
like the whole week dorang macam
macam enemies eh macam tak nak dorang gaduh banyak tak cakap apa-apa padahal untuk van kita
beginning macam
tak kesah all then at the end of the whole thing kita orang macam woo woo woo
berapa one week plus
I remember when kita dah balik he still message me for photo
I'm like ya like okay hantar hantar hantar hantar
so what what did we do kita buat oh we did bungee jumping
oh dia tolak
ya I was like siapa eh I think kaysa eh anyway I was just telling her like
I couldn't see where my legs were I couldn't see where I was going so of course I just raba raba
so instead instead of the muka-muka kawan it's basically
do you want to talk about the food atau makanan atau everyday activity
aku baru nak tanya what's stopping you
no the question was three but never mind I don't tengok we take turns ah
I mean dulu aku pernah
primary school pernah belajar apa inline skating so I'm assuming that it will be similar to ice skating
I feel like I pernah tanya kaysa
ya you know hari tu dorang saja-saja satu keluarga pergi pergi apa ni kat kallang punya eh ice skating sama-sama and then dorang complain budak-budak tu kacau
similar like if you can naik if you can inline skate then you can ice skate that's what she said
right and then if you you know especially why kau tengok kau tengok movie movie kan dorang tengok ah macam pretty women yang baru punya tu eh pretty women pula little women kan
and then they there was a scene where joe and laurie pergi kat lake and then after that they skate
tak hitam ke tak merah tak sunburn
banana boat ke
you tak tahu swim you tak nak mati
it's not it's not like the tarik you that kind
tak ada lah
oh ah memang a'ah
okay tapi tu kalau I if you tahu macam mana nak float kan aku rasa okay jer
kalau macam gitu then okay lah bye bye
asal kan kau tak mati okay jer macam floating is the kau tak mati
jangan apa ni jangan dapat cramps sudah
ah hujan ah
a'ah hujan ah
cable car dari bawah naik
oh as opposed to dua hari
it's either they brought the stones up atau dorang carve dari mountain
uh huh uh huh selalunya dorang carve kan dari mountain
oh I thought I thought macam dorang tak tahan lepas tu tolong terlalu banyak tension cabut
sana memang orang punya license pun
okay okay I mean aku faham dia tinggal kat negara singapura dah lama juga you know what I mean
huh suara lain sikit
tak payah nak try
so sabar so dia that means dia stop ah terus dia cabut as in
or memang plan dia memang until that time aje
kalau kita kita nak kena fikir lama-lama nak kena hmm
and then eventually we masih bodoh cakap jom boleh
okay kau cakap tak worth it aku ikut
oh dia macam okay ah tak payah nak ikut lama-lama ah
malaysia banyak tempat apa kau nak gi terengganu boleh langkawi
aku baru nak I was about to say ubin then I'm like what the heck is wrong with me
baik I think kalau indonesia jangan dulu ah
pasal dorang belum lagi control dorang punya
err problem sikit tapi boleh juga
embassy malaysia eh indonesia pun tak kasi masuk pe
aku nya plan nak kena cari kerja lah
okay dah dah satu jam okay continue another day
atas view of orchard tapi err in a budget hotel
I mean okay lah I mean considering dia punya apa tu space and all that is really small but I just think that it's quite macam convenient and comfortable because macam very cosy
ya it's it's really giving me the vibes because macam like you have to walk through the lorong and all that to find the entrance and then along the way you see people
you see like residential and all that lah so macam I actually do feel like as if I'm not in singapore ya although once you step out onto orchard road then you'll be like ah okay
I hate it oh my god macam like betul betul self-conscious sia oh my god will she see my body
nobody's going to stare I mean I know you're not gonna stare kalau like terglare and then you like oh no
ya ya I'm fine with it I mean it's not like we datang selalu kan so
ya then you have to wait lah queue then wait for the aunty to like okay adik berapa orang okay dua orang duduk okay ah
adik also it's not abang okay it's adik cause he's younger than us ya
I also don't know lah but he look I call him adik cause it's just an insult to him can you imagine if it's if you you talk to him ah adik nasi ayam dua I tell you it'll be so insulting
we'll be like adik nasi ayam dua satu tak nak sambal
not being very friendly because we've always had our encounters with uh female punya shopkeeper yang macam fierce and garang right
nak apa dik nak apa huh makan lah dik semua tak nak
ya so macam like oh okay lah maybe he wants to be one of the first few male stall keepers or store owners ya don't have a very friendly approach to their customers
lucky plaza sahaja so I think because you see eh the near nenek atau mak tak tahu lah dia punya atuk ke apa they are actually very friendly people ya so I think that's what
attracted people or to you know to want to keep coming and all that cause dorang tahu macam orh ah nak pakcik ni cute ah macam like dia selalu smiling
and also because if you are working there and it's lunchtime you wouldn't want to like waste so much time talking and then especially kalau queue makanan kau sampai of course you want to cepat-cepat kasi habis pe
you mean angkat ayam merah oh ya
oh yang kat tepi err
mm I mean macam like what I mean is like my brother-in-law
like he he he's on a keto diet he works out and all that tapi ah ya his diabetic punya reading has reduced but his cholesterol level is still high up there so ya it really depends ah I mean yes you lead a healthy lifestyle but certain things you cannot avoid
he did this one going on for a couple of years what it's just that macam he only started yang exercise is much more rigorous because err he goes I mean he eventually found like kaki to you know run and all there and then you know lah people kat sana dorang selalu macam nak
buat apa tu compete siapa lari lagi banyak and all that ya
ya so I don't know how is it like ya but whatever it is there are I mean there are cases whereby orang macam like oh they lead healthy lifestyle but my children turn out to be diabetic that kind of thing so it really depends lah so it's always good to always
uh check whether you punya you know levels okay ke tak
it's very frustrating ah macam like especially for my brother-in-law cause dia dah yes my don't know my blood sugar sugar reading has is now acceptable
cause he's really looking forward to be put back on so boleh naik pangkat
ya exactly but because doctor kata dia ada this certain levels you know that kind of thing so dia tak boleh ambil ah ya so he needs to be macam semua okay so that he can resume taking then lepas tu baru dia boleh considered for uh promotion
mm I mean like you will be wondering lah so I remember macam like on sangat kuruskan badan lah and all that because ya he's stuck there because like macam they said that oh because of your health you know maybe you cannot do a lot of rigorous work so cannot
get promoted macam tu ah
not ya this is going to be a long period lah mana boleh overnight turn kau ni pun
so ya so um I mean I was telling lah maybe you know nutritionist or dietitian you know tell them that okay I nak turunkan my eh my cholesterol level so how do I start off how do I do so
tak lah dia pergi doctor just untuk check dia punya apa tu blood sugar level then cholesterol level is nothing to do with macam like okay so what am I supposed to do next it's just that main pun gila so aku marah dengan kakak
but just tauge because err okay
ya ya that's one thing that I don't really like cause like macam you want to be healthy then okay lor unless you you know it's really your source of income whereby you share with your viewers what you've been doing so that they can learn from there and all that tapi setakat macam nak like show off then ugh
I like apa tu make your own plans lah as
no more like my father is atas not us we're not there yet
apanya yang birch car punya skirt
oh okay okay uh yang baju lengan pendek tu ah okay okay
but now it's available kau tak nak beli
beli satu jer
mm mm it's really about whether or not um you nak better details but you need to take care of the material ataupun
and specifically macam like you do not have menses on that day
four or five pieces of clothing on depends ah sometimes I buy more if there's like available designs then I don't I don't spend for the next six months then I wait macam cause I beli tengah mid year sale atau end year sale
and then I will purposely go bila err towards the end of the sale period I mean I know there's not more there's not many err options for me so I just make do with what's available lah
you know like okay lah boleh pakai pergi kerja boleh pergi mana which explains my poor choices of clothing lately lah it's really makcik makcik bodoh but then
ada ada yang teruk lah aku macam terjujur juga
mm mm no but you must also always set aside something lah like for your self-care and all that tapi it's just with self-care fund that you dah set aside you have to really properly choose your battle lah macam like I nak pergi let's say lah pedi mani mani pedi ke lagi massage ke you know
um hair treatment ke so it's really macam you have to choose one of those macam ya
macam staycay you know that kind of thing with your husband that kind of thing ya tak boleh macam like I nak pergi staycay then lepas tu I nak buat kuku I I nak buat rambut I no no such thing ya
maintain lah bengok
no it's really about macam the people that you you mingle with and all that and whether or not they can actually see the difference because nobody knows or cares like you don't wear the tag outside you know unless you wear a dress that just splash like that kind of thing you know
ya so technically kalau macam begitu
kalau macam begitu lah it really depends actually ya um you what you buy something that you really foresee yourself wearing it a couple of times and you're comfortable with it ya murah tak kesah asalkan okay lah you guna kan
kat ion yes
I mean if don't have also you can always pergi dengan
dengan apa tu yang budak yang baru kena inject kat uh spine cause she was heavy breathing yesterday right
then itu lah naik Grab mm
ya exactly but he can what he can do is just uh call the hospital just to inform and then after that err tell them that I will update again when I'm collecting lah than daripada keep quiet call kena towed away you know we don't want that to happen
why would you not inform the building or the hospital building that you have left a vehicle there bodoh sia
ya but the doctor's not gonna keep checking every single time eh motor ada kat situ tak motor ada kat situ tak
mm mm so ya lah nak kena kena actually call or inform at least just to check
never it's my first time I mean I've heard of it before tapi
no never because I think because of location macam
ya so far so tak tak hairan lah
ya lah that was even later you know that was in october ya so the paling recent pun
ya can you imagine oh my god letak the kids at home I need to get them out
no lah because you have to book in cause you just you just got the vouchers right so you can only book macam only now lah recently sebelum ni tak boleh book in advance
ya ya ya staycay is that one lah that one is a given itu ada book err quite early
tapi macam like
ya lah new year pun expensive lah mana mana expensive seh cause nak step tengok fireworks ah and all that
can you imagine you stay here then kau nampak kat hujung there's fireworks okay ah
eh but if you have new year's eve kat sini then you look out quite nice eh
oh okay okay tahu tahu a'ah tahu tahu okay okay
mahal gila mahal gila I mean dia macam chalet eh ke apa ni
resort lah macam itu
ee boring nya
now just lebih mahal sia
nak beratur still mahal satu malam
ya but at least kau turun pun banyak barang kau boleh buat apa
I mean you can do a lot go jewel walk walk look at the fountain kat sana tengok momok
ya the thing is kadang kala how soon are you even going to set foot out of singapore I mean kalau nak kata kan pulau ubin okay lah eh but you you don't need a passport for that tapi I mean like international-wise
I don't think it's gonna be anytime soon ah maybe like macam pertengahan twenty twenty one
I entah lah aku mana tahu
they delayed because err tiba-tiba ada the spike in the number of cases ah
and sketchy sekarang
I think macam I think kat thailand macam tak teruk sangat kau tahu tapi yang teruk would be macam kat um malaysia
because I think number of cases so far yang dorang report kat news thailand macam tak ada jer
mean ada yang tempat rural ke
I mean for him is like we shouldn't have had done more tests right bodoh
ya like you know we have our rights we have our amendments and all that then okay lah kasut kau orang lah I feel like these are the people that shouldn't be getting any err medical attention if they ever get COVID
all over the country oh bagus lah good job
mm mm mm mm tengok jer lah
how sure are you there are the same group of people mungkin tak lah ada tapi segelintir
daripada dorang ada buat merepek ni then you like ah korang minta kena sepak
ya you know that time dekat asia one kan tunjuk dua budak remaja kat dalam train tak pakai mask bodoh betul
that's the thing someone took a picture but then after that I don't know whether any actions were taking they taken by you know the safe distancing ambassador atau the staff and all that
so like I I just feel like kadang-kadang orang singapore ini kan dorang banyak complain banyak ambil gambar banyak submit video when it comes to action it's zero so annoying
ada lah segelintir
no dia kena saman lazarus island pun sama semua kena saman
I feel like you kalau jail yang perempuan yang kata mana tak
ya that one she does it she did it repeatedly kalau you want to talk about jail then she should be jailed because like first time tak serik second time tak serik
ya lah but the thing is it still has to be fair for everyone lah like got the first time okay kalau kau buat lagi then that's it kau minta kena sepak you know that kind of thing
apa dia we have what
no the thing is adela they have different arrangement adela so macam like offices right now right they said ah cannot have more than fifty employees at one time
okay and then like in my office right they have that macam
kan begini ah seh
khatib khatib kat mana ni
oh kat yishun itu
oh yang ah ya ya I wanted to ask him mana then I I saw HomeTeam
panjat panjat panjat then lepas tu
but ada lah I've been avoiding arrows so much
alah kesian
maybe should just put disclaimer I'm really nice please don't take my niceness wrongly you know macam cerita a walk to remember please don't fall in love with me
oh ya that's true dorang just bengat gila sia
yes ke bedek ah you know like ah
aww awak ambil berat tentang saya ke oh alah comelnya naik nombor boleh ah pergi mampus lah
ku baik salah ku tak baik salah semua adiknya pergi mampus lah
I think no lah maybe just because like I don't know maybe dorang main game and then it's nice to talk and because it's really a place for you to macam vent you know dekat rumah you know that kind of thing
okay jer lah aku dah biasa benda begini
like ya like I even have my favourite buaya at uh
no lah because you know kat malaysia kan ada satu video ni the mum ke the father ask the the child bunyi ayam macam mana bunyi kucing macam mana bunyi itik macam mana
I tak tahu and then bunyi buaya macam mana the bunyi buaya is hi sayang
ya so what I mean my favourite buaya is I have this one player who always use the same line on me every single time we play
so I was like eh buaya favourite I and then he's like hi sayang still bisik-bisik nak tidur kan ah macam mana you tahu
I'll be like pergi mampus boleh ya
uh ya usually do that in the presence of other guys then they'll be like kau yang buaya lah sia
tak tahu lah aku malas layan tu kalau dorang mengamuk tu antara bini dengan dia bukan aku nya pasal
alah kesian
kan you main game lah belajar lah main game
I mean nak kena ada schedule lah like okay my previous clan right err
they they are they are they are all muslim married and they have children and all that so what they do is uh they they actually actually agreed with their wife tahu macam okay I will settle everything I will take care of the kids you know homework and all that but then I will play I will have my playing time from nine thirty onwards
is is is is surprising because you know why pasal mereka berbual dalam telephone kan eh dalam game okay abang dah habis ngaji bang okay sekarang barang simpan dalam beg lepas tu balik bilik tidur eh
adik adik macam mana adik homework dah habis ke dik okay kalau dah habis tu kalau tak buat kasi habis dah habis nanti abah check nanti adik boleh tidur
so it's normal lah I mean like there are people who can actually like set aside time you know err really manage time and all that tapi ada tak tahu lah yang macam bengap semacam
I mean like there are a few macam like shirk responsibility sanggup balik rumah lambat and all that pasal nak main game kat luar
tak tahu mana aku tahu but long time never play with the person so I also don't know what happen to him
ya I already at that point of time I thought dia belum kahwin tahu because uh my that time my friend was like kau dekat rumah bujang uh uh then I was like rumah bujang then after that I ask my friend then I said rumah bujang tu apa dia kata macam like you know like basically is what they mean like for us is void deck tapi dorang mana rumah flat kat situ kan so is macam like those
pondok-pondok like kosong like people rest
mm mm macam itu lah along the road ada satu err so that's what they call rumah bujang lah
tak tak tepi road lah tapi ah correct ya ya correct ah ah ah lah sial
then aku aku macam cause nanti dia macam like okay aku nak balik
eh kat mana ni sekarang
eh lawa kat rumah bujang ni then I was like that's when like I was I was like asking my friend after he left the group ah the lobby right
dia tanya kau orang eh
uh rumah bujang tu apa rumah tempat dorang lepak-lepaknya you know macam like macam like okay rumah dia tak boleh lepak ke and then he's like tak tahu lah you tanya dia sendiri
ya and then that time I managed to ask the person lah I said asal kau tak main kat rumah sendiri err dia kata kat rumah dia punya internet tak bagus pasal kat dia nya rumah dekat-dekat dengan hutan-hutan situ
fair enough because like macam awak that time even like normal phone reception
was really bad because it's really near the hutan
ya so I'm like okay lah fair enough lah desak kau kau buat apa kau nak
ya lah data pun tak boleh
ya it's just cause it's really because of reception so-called research tak bagus data pun tak bagus
actually right I think it's just the telco problem because like my friend's kat itself like the area itself is not that highland it's quite macam low to medium right depending ah
so ya so I think it's just the country telcos lah lepas alah
kan macam kat atas bukit pun boleh kau ambil
ya ya I do that tapi nak kena ada portable charger lah or maybe mm mm mm
tapi kalau macam like err either a portable charger then I can play for awhile and then after that charge my phone like for a while
mm mm betul betul
it's literally macam cucuk selah
apa pasal aku berdarah sia kat bawah
like I feel like I fell like macam I be right again
so macam lepas tu aku pergi toilet kan I kencing lepas tu aku tengok ada darah I was like
takut bilang kau that time
akunya akunya benda baik balik bodoh
is because it's really macam masuk then dia pakai macam clamp sakit bodoh
kau belum kena lagi kan berbual banyak huh
they do put the benda macam gel like cold gel or warm gel don't remember at your your area there
no it's very fast it's not even five minutes it's lesser than that cuma like the initial part a bit painful lah
you know it think about it it's for your health so you just do it it's very fast the cepat and you get the result on the spot also
ah kalau ada fibroid ke tak so buat buat sekali lah and then
I know but the thing is my mum also was in pain and then she was like macam like she let up a yelp right and then after that I'm like begini sudah beranak dua no I said no I said I said dah beranak dua kali pun nak bising and then when I kena
okay no she wasn't there right so when I told her sakit baru kau tahu macam sakit she's like
I don't know why but she's always been waiting to use that line on her children like I still remember that time when my sister first give birth and she was complaining to my mum like sakitnya badan berapa sakitnya then she's like baru kau tahu macam mana sakitnya beranakan
ada ambil ah
eh but then when I was at the clinic ini kan it's so awkward
because semua orang datang dengan dorang punya partner I went there alone
tak tahu apa nak buat kesian like husband pandai buat you know that kind of thing
bila nak penetrate semua nak ya bodohnya jantan
ya depan belakang tak boleh okay pusat pun boleh
ya air air I also quite a number of people lah you know people in who had late pregnancies then I see teenagers with their mum it's so it's quite sad actually
like I pretend macam dengar music daripada hal
tak nampak pregnant ah tapi dia macam nangis lah but I wanted to tell the mum like you're doing a great job ya
unless ada orang tolong jagakan anak dia lah
mmhmm lepas beranak ah mm mm
macam like sexual education but not about abstaining like I think that abstaining not aduh what is not a question anymore you know cause like they're doing it at a very young age I think it's more about macam how to have sex responsibly or safely
pakai tu lah saran wrap
ya because err err kadang-kadang you know before when they did that ligation right maybe an egg has already been released
yang biasa-biasa jer lah
err sadly due to the circuit breaker the the zoo closed down jadi terpaksa cari tempat lain lah nak kerja tau err
but err I would say the experience there is err pretty mundane compared to working at the zoo the zoo you meet like a lot of macam tourists
I feel macam the camaraderie is is very ya
true lah I mean then again stung lah so people will want avoid tempat-tempat yang crowded lah ramai orang kan susah apa
oh then you quit lepas tu after that few week
so like macam freshie ah
tak payah lah tak payah
oh they approve of your ni lah
you must be worth it lah you kerja keras for a bit only then you graduate with two majors bro everyone wants you man
true lah true lah there's a lot of ya there's a lot of work lah you want to jaga both double major and your part time job it's too much ah even I will crazy man
ah ya hal ehwal masing-masing lah
are you taking of err joining any macam like the malay atau join silat ke silat
macam banyak of my friends lah yang from my err secondary school
all of us decided to join silat together lah
since uh dah rapat kan and then we understand each other
ya then lebih baik lah better for us lah
ya but macam not really official lah I I had to give up the role kepada yang
my best friend yang I feel that it's more suitable lah cause I busy lah with work
kerja then I need to jaga my nenek and atuk
ah speaking of that err about family kan how how are you err ayah and mama
dia orang okay lah
aiyo dia masih belajar situ lah alamak
so macam like err kirakan dia punya pelajaran is a bit uh staggered behind lah is it
but but the your your brother is a genius lah budak pandai kan so shouldn't be an issue lah for him
ya ya my err yang paling kecil lah she taking O level this year
she seems pretty ready I guess sebab dia macam revise lah at home
she err staying up like lewat malam just to macam she catch up on her revision
err nasihat nasihat yang baik lah orang katakan lah ya
ya as suri teladan lah to her
ya her birthday is coming though so I'm pretty excited to celebrate dia punya hari jadi ya
err bulan depan I think early early early august ya
your dad's birthday is coming also right in two months dua bulan from now
ah boleh celebrate sama sama ah macam gitu ah
cause she's been applying for kerja kerja yang macam full time dekat ah those art companies lah last I heard is the teaching lah
she might err ajar budak secondary school so she went
ya ya she's up sebagai our best lah ya the prestige programme lah in our school you know junior college ya
ya she tried lah so now tunggu result jer lah see what the says if if approve then she gets into lah if not
you need two to three minggu from now
ya I feel super disappointed ah I mean kalau tak I already had plans or to travel around europe lah
and then catch the the swiss alps but macam biasa lah people wouldn't think lor
and ya and err on the bright side also nasib baik lah cause I save a lot of money I mean the money I can use it to beli rumah ke
ya oh ya then ah how's your your dad's ah youtube channel ada masa upload upload videos tak
ya betul
so you expect the baby to appear at eh appear eh they expect for the baby to be born lah in err dalam late november begitu
ya all of us are pretty excited lah kita even macam dah buat a baby shower um eh not baby shower sorry gender reveal ya
so ya I I mean it's just to lighten up everyone punya spirits lah given ya this macam hard
ya and I and my kakak wen is the
anak pertama lah to carry a child for the family
so ya my my mother and my uh brother-in-law punya mother both of them plan out lah the this party for us
so harap harap err it's going to be fun err it's gonna happen I think ah early next month also
ya her mother will masak makanan for us and then after that my mum will plan out dia punya games and
err aktiviti-aktiviti lah yang kita akan buat on that day itself
the government punya pantang larang kan mesti ikut
kita respect respectable lah
eh jangan lah
malu lah
because she can still err go to work lah but her macam orang atas don't want her to come
because he works at the port right so he helps err he is a I think I think he's an engineer then dia tolong macam pasang lah kalau ada any macam equipment yang rosak
so recently he managed to land a proper stable full time job so I I think he macam gembira ah like wow finally he get a job ah
err ah school err apa tu yuran ya yuran sekolah unlike us lah for for
then dia orang tayangkan the whole thing on err facebook live
so they will be like oh ah school of engineering dekat bawah jer nama-nama dia punya students ya in that slow
so in that zoom session dia orang ada buat macam lucky draw lah so you can win prizes ya ya you can get like airpods err jabra elite mostly macam those school technology gadgets lah
ya dia lagi sikit menang seh she said err she said err the one that wins ya it's usually like either dua ke atas dua ke bawah so
I actually ordered err ice cream untuk dia so like
ya then kat rumah I think got no one so uh ya I ordered ice cream for her graduation gift ya then I'm not sure lah cause the number is
ah the number I gave to the company is her number so I mean worst come to worst they will call her lah but they said they don't provide any dry ice so I'm hoping that dia balik sebelum
so mana tahu ah got nasib ah time tujuh then baru hantar
sudah macam one package already
to macam give her I I heard they give her like cremeway alright for her to munch cause of her support for you
aku tahu semua ni ya
that's very nice okay oh it's a chinese girl I I I I forgot I thought it was a I've I've always thought that it will be macam err mixed girl lah
oh really I tak perasan
oh so she's also in our university juga lah
oh she any idea which err kursus she admit in our school
oh wee kim wee is a oh jangan bilang you take double major because of her go wee kim wee
you jangan main-main ni ah
ya pretty surprising eh terkejut I you know
faham lah faham lah
so that macam so far takde macam concrete plans lah with a it's just like you guys
ya lah nanti orang cakap apa kan kalau kita iya lah terlalu excited all then
dude I really want to I really want to but susah lah ni
probably satu dua jam then after that you have to sleep because your work in the next day and
paiseh sangat
jadi kalau awak macam interested kan you can actually join us lah because we just need one more one more person to play the lead guitar we have nadia on the
and then we have err loofy on the keyboard and I'll be paying the drums so we just need someone to fit in the role as pemain guitar lah for us so do you uh interested
uh this is sometime next week dalam hari either jumaat atau sabtu
tengok ah loofy macam mana ah loofy dia memang kadang-kadang suka main-main ah dia macam tak tak serious ya
ya that time dia ni dia dia kerja dekat challenger juga for one day
then after that he I think he fought with his manager that's why he had it lah cause I think the manager kind of bully him also but given he's aggressive nature kan so he macam he quit on the very day also lah
he quit lah I mean ya it they kind of buang him lah he even though he is as as as aggressive as he gets dia punya orang baik sebenarnya
he was the top scorer lah for our class though I don't know ah for A level surprisingly dia punya result didn't reflect
so macam a bit hampa and disappointment
err ya we doing before solat
then after that we pergi solat sama-sama
oh ya ya ya me and loofy kita orang dah apply dah earlier earlier beforehand we apply already
but usually dia punya slot usually cepat ambil lah pasal dia pakcik-pakcik semua dia orang always wants slots right
ah usually the tingkat satu ah closer to the imam
oh no no no no no err now now the wuduk you take from home ah then
ya they they close off the matikan all the air lah
ya tu lah kita orang tak nak banyak interaction lah with other so we keep it at the minimal lah
but who knows you might fist bump juga in the masjid also lah maybe I mean
mm but this is all purely just speculation lah ya bukan betul kan
mm so makan biasa-biasa jer lah like mee rebus dengan mee soto
wow nasi sambal goreng bang dia punya rendang apa
kau kena try bro
tak tak tak sempat because I bangun like just nice at the ninety four minutes mah
then just nice lah so like I terbangun then like oh my god dah pukul lima eh so the next thing I do was I ambil wuduk then I prepare for subuh lah
so ya cik jamal
ya he was lah but he he don't want to macam made me conform to any err beliefs lah
ya it's like he wants me to have the freedom to choose apa team yang I nak support
understandable lah dia orang dekat kan
boleh masuk champions league ya
oh jauh sangat lah
sean jadi millionaire
so any message you want me to hantarkan sampaikan kepada mister havi
I think tiga puluh tahun kan and I think
he's been waiting for this lah dah lama seh he tunggu go their win right
so he really it really bucks him lah when they don't don't win a match or dia orang tak tak uh perform as well as he nak dia orang to perform lah
my as a firefighter ya and kita dulu masuk the station together together
cause you will from the academy also together and we went through our our final exam ya our trainings and when we were posted at the same station we were very happy ah kat yishun situ
the daerah canberra
meanwhile they told us in training is lain what from what you are going experience real life
oh oh so so you so you were like macam patrolman lah gitu ronda-ronda around the area
wah they are not worrying ah like you I mean do you get calls often or macam takde masalah ke in the area
oh err I mean like since you are posted in a the area macam tak ramai orang kan so like aren't you like bored or something cause like do you get a lot of calls in that area
macam tak pressure lah orang tak I don't feel macam orang bully you or anything
ah dia orang macam
hibur-hiburkan lah so like it's successorize the the news man to them especially I mean if you're in there yourself you know how the culture works so
oh lari-lari anak around area
but but usually berapa jauh you run
macam the only only time I ran jauh gitu is back when I was in serving my lah they make us run around ubin
and I think that's the way lah macam orang tak tahu you cannot drink a lot kalau nak minum sikit jer kalau boleh jangan minum at all
uh habis
thirty minutes baru jer minum that that's the ideology that
ah macam
ya it's about biology larh and then oh ada mention yang if you drink more during your exercise you are kind of
ya it it can be that and also you didn't ni lah um ah wash your body
because everybody have their own limit right so kita tak boleh kita tak boleh push too much lah nanti orang cakap kan
but ya berapa banyak juice you suka minum in one day selalu
okay true lah because like for me macam I want to avoid drinking gassy drinks kan macam air air air yang sweet ni semua
boleh mendatangkan kencing manis so
ya so uh at home pun I only got air masak
jadi most of the time the only ah the best alternative would definitely be juices ah
oh no I don't like to buy all these macam manufactured punya cause I feel macam dia tak mendatangkan any
apa tu benefit lah so I selalu beli pergi pasar then I beli dua tiga macam buah-buahan
ah biji biji buah-buahan then I balik I potong I blend
then I letak air then I minum ah
it's right way ya my ni if you if you if you if you got the time my ni always recommend lah when you blend kan you blend dengan dia punya kulit-kulit sekali
ah dengan kulit-kulit dia but the biji the biji you take out
okay lah the kulit err
oh ya ya ya apa dia apa I heard some fruits eh if you don't
do it properly right it might be more harmful than good lah jadi kena macam pandai-pandai lah
ya oh eh grapefruit dengan grape is lain eh tak sama eh
grapefruit dengan grape dia orang tak sama kan dia orang two different fruits ah lain kan
siapa ah yang come out eh nama-nama ni
tu lah
lain eh aiyo
because I started a business selling tahu begedil selling tahu begedil yes
basically because I like to eat tahu begedil
um quite recently eh ah like last month ah late last month when tahu begedil was was like a trend
um tahu begedil and they both
apa tu macam ada lah dia punya kesedapan tu kan ya
for a while because ibu force me to
but um making this tahu begedil of course I only started recently
um eh I mean there were no macam kedai taking any orders so like I decide just to do myself
so I think ah this tahu begedil I will only sell bila ada time lah macam holidays
so maybe like maybe the next week is not tahu begedil it's like
oh I didn't call I didn't name it but ibu and abang named it as
bawal yes tudung bawal you know there's square scarf
um one is the our cotton bawal and another is our satin silk
matte satin silk bawal and our cotton bawal it sells
kita suka try benda like try to do things new things and we try to ya lah
we hustle a lot macam tak kesah ah kalau hari-hari kerja
asalkan like kita boleh rasa duit tu ah
ah inshallah wah untuk ah benda yang halal
oh like mati macam melayu
apa tu open casting for new models
like tak suka ambil gambar and I don't feel like I was pretty to become a model a hijabi model
so I was a bit stupid at that point of time no I I didn't simpan because the quality is like shit
and then I come back with just a piece of tudung for me it's like merepek so
ibu um
apa ni um shops coming to you uh for shooting she said then okay lah I start from fifteen dollars now I charge fifty per hour
people also come to me um to do to create apa to help their business boost by doing marketing and video edits
I don't know whatever barang that the company gave with plus money and then they just look pretty on it
because I've tried uh an influencer before to boost start my um Kamash um the tudung brand
apa tu our
to the company first let them approve apa-apa macam if they want to change they can change and then then we just write it up some people ah macam tambah-tambah lah ah themselves and then they
then they send back to us then baru kita copy paste and then put
selling clothes selling muslimah clothes but of course not those you know typical those resellers or whatever it's just like
macam ah you need to do your research err do survey do prototype everything
um sellers terdahulu biasa about apa yang dorang suka instead of what
you get what I mean macam they
assume that orh aku suka ni so confirm orang lain akan suka
pasal um a lot of people say eh ni lawa confirm ada orang suka confirm ada orang suka but we cannot hear what our family members really um say we need to reach out to people
ya one mistake is I listen to my partner's mum ah she said like orh ni colour cantik everything whatever shit
but then actually salah ah it's not selling our first
simple macam not too flashy can be an everyday wear so our first collection was successful tapi a lot of people was doubting like especially families were doubting
like eh eh ni mana ada orang pakai cotton lagi kan panas kan panas but it sell out like a lot um we bought I'm ten colours
bila dah membesar right sambil membesar
ya sambil nak membesar tu kita selalu tukar-tukar tau apa kita nak jadi apa kita suka
I love debating a lot ya I love debating and then ibu tak suka so like okay then I say I told her I want to be a nurse
um she said oh you know um macam she tell told me all the negative things lah all the
it's like jaga mayat jaga mayat and then like
but of course ibu also tak kasi because she say I will mati cepat the I'm like kalau ajal tu ada mati lah I mean like we cannot
macam mana nak cakap eh like
technically this what I'm doing right now fashion design is what ibu wants me to do lah
is the hantu remember
ya show I've been too because it's like so nice and it's mix of scary because I was little masih kecil kan that time
uh apa tu um aku rugi lah mm mm
obviously tahu begedil I I can eat that every day then after that I always doubt myself like oh I need to to control myself because
dah lama nanti aku aku juga jadi santau bagedil kan
tak okay aku tak boleh tak makan but if I can
apa seh
even if people bila
silat ya but then we stop because like um
the penjuru is it the guru the head of the silat or something like that I don't know what what they call him
he campur with
benda tak elok lah um with
jin yes
no sister his sister yang ini kat luar I it was at sengkang it was at sengkang you know those macam got court badminton court ya we silat there
one point of time macam tengah buat benda sendiri ah and then like
tapi like I saw this guru and this student like a teenage student
um tengah terbaring tau
the guru is like macam gitu macam baca-baca then I'm like what the hell is this person doing like um like what macam dia sakit ke I don't know anything but then I heard that she was
he made that person rasuk lah katakan
one of our uncle also was in the same silat with us siapa tu ah ariff ah he quitted first and then we quit
I feel like is a traditional err okay um one thing I learned about silat while doing my research for my last time was
the their silat is actually
a'ah tekan
like how to say um okay selalunya sekarang orang kat luar kan dorang gaduh kan dia rembat jer tapi dulu masa orang melayu zaman dulu when they are in a battle
um they tunjuk respect to one another first and they you know buka bunga is where you show like oh are you ready
to silat then ya
ya macam gitu lah
last time they really gold the adat lah
various lah silat taekwando
as long as you belah after two weeks ah I don't mind
like being straightforward it's like just say lah like oh apa I don't like it like can you like pick pick the clothes up
like uh aku akan ambil macam angkat ah baju-baju kotor ni but some people see it as rude macam orh
uh so macam katakan kau tak nak aku sini ah aku kena buat semua benda ah kat rumah ni
ya the melayu so formal I cannot
ah no we only speak it when ada oral ke
with abang
biasanya with abang or ibu a bit lah macam gini lah like transition between english and malay but for hilah hundred percent english
ah I also don't know eh but um one of my friends like dia sekarang dalam uni and he is a
he major in journalist bahasa melayu lah so
language ya macam ada perkataan like tak pernah dengar and then like the whole sentence like what I don't even understand
so macam I feel like
bahasa melayu ni is not for today lah
orang dulu-dulu because orang dulu
macam bahasa baku kan
along the way people macam get lazier and they tend to shorten the words so instead of dekat kau kena
lima minit short tak apa lah

kat rumah that's all
oh so most of the time during the holiday kau kat kerja ah
ah okay okay oh ya lah that time kau bilang kan ah
ya okay lah but still know because of this pandemic right tak banyak orang ah so the you know the lorong right when they all usually like ah lalu right
true lah but tetap masih ada macam budak townees ah
no no no as in like I only started few weeks ago so ya kirakan baru start ah
semangat masih boil ah
ya alhamdulilah dah dah dapat ah
I confirm stress tapi I think it's manageable lah
masing-masing ah
ngam-ngam lah that you all that like dah rapat already
but all this uh all budak history ah
track and field lah but silat
at least ya at least you all know betul-betul joining together ah
oh oh okay okay okay awesome kirakan too much commitment ah
cause you know dia kan belajar kat china kan so when he came back
masih ah but then when he come back
you're like going there physically cause kan medicine kena buat those like physical
ya so now he just lepak kat rumah you know
dia kan ambil kan
you have to do what you have to do ah sebagai you know the abang-abang besar kan
mm ya betul correct correct
what bila ah
bulan oh september ya correct correct
oh that means apply kat
ah kau dah biasa dah buat kan
I mean you did throughout your few years kat the uh
mm mm ya that's good but bila ah bila the results keluar
kalau apa-apa ke apa-apa you just update me ah cause
so so boleh macam you know meet up minum kopi chat chat
ya see but I guess tu kau punya rezeki ah
maybe it's it's better ya kau punya nasib ah better that you've stayed in singapore
cause and then again like the virus situation so belum contain right
oh ya ya ya so have you save up save up for the you know the eventual you punya
oh ya ya ya do it do it do it err I would say it's quite erratic ah dia punya upload like
err cause he has a few differing passions lah kan ah so the initial golf err content that he used to upload right has been on a hub for awhile lah so this sekarang like this past few days he's been you know more interested in collecting airplane models
quite canggih ah for his age
this is the first time kurang experience
ah ya ya ya ya betul betul betul
ya kena ikut dia punya apa
the syarat-syarat
very diligent ah ikut dia punya
err undang-undang ah
dia okay
tu yang penting ah
ya I mean furthermore ours even more mahal lah dia punya apa school the yuran lah so
mmhmm kerja bayar jer uh this ah very efficient ah
slow jer like star wars punya the highlight reel ah
mm dia kan punya
is it held on apa which platform zoom
oh yang the sekolah dah apa sponsor
bro macam mana bro
the thing dah cair ah
but right that means if she's not at home then they won't leave it kat depan pintu ah
ya you know those the standard ones at the floral express where there are they put my macam
ya the standard one ah ya err cukup for that show some appreciation lah
you know sedekah
tu lah it's the standard lah you know how
no lah no no dude that one that one purely my rezeki ah
nasib ah nasib
well I guess communication is key ah yang penting ah so
potential nak kena backfire ah you know this kind of stuff so better to keep it macam tame first
furthermore kalau main also like
so cannot play sampai lambat also kan
tak betul ah ah I know ah
oh apa ni
baik tau
he quit or kena buang
oh but ya I heard back then dia punya temper also quite
but kalau I think
I should be down to jam with you all lah kalau jumaat lepas solat
if you want to go together then kena apply online kan to get the queue
dia orang fast game ah dah apply online
the best seats is tingkat berapa
takde yang rapatkan saf lah
kena expand
the wuduk area now they dia orang taruh apa sanitizer
so then that means salam pun tak boleh ah
orang only the orang atas would know lah all what is set in stone lah
and that one pun mostly kat my
ya so it's the same old kedai kopi and err you know the mall right ya
ya the standard breakfast punya mee rebus mee siam nasi sambal goreng
ah okay okay ya I also thought I thought you would also do that macam dah second nature kan ambil wuduk
oh cik jamal oh I always thought he was
ya all this while right I thought he was like a nottingham forest punya supporter
cause you punya opponent mm
mid table but kalau menang the last two matches then
a bit out of reach ah ya jauh sangat
tu yang quite disappointing ah
um win ah so syabas to them
dua puluh tahun is it ya liverpool won punya premier league
but I will have to say ah dia punya though he quite semangat ah
in supporting liverpool sometimes his tweets will be melampau ah
is he is he still the regular kat your fire station
mm no doubt lah he is really a budak baik lah
biasa ah you know just
ya so a bit sedih ah
where your where you stay your residence ya so ya so I kena posted kat foxtrot division ah tak banyak orang yang tinggal kat this area ah
oh I would say there's a fair share of calls lah there's there's still ongoing back then lah err but I won't say it's as much as the those hot zones like macam woodlands jurong
but no doubt lah there's always calls here and there lah whether their severity macam
ya I I feel the same way ah as as much as like you know the berita dia orang cover and all these cases of
macam mismanagement
I think it's isolated punya cases
cause biasanya macam
tak macam gitu ah usually it's more civilized and laid back ah I would say nothing much going on ah
kan kena stay active kan
ya but I think is tak susah ah tak susah sangat lah but it's
kena biasakan so
mm cause when you when you first start lah like after one ten and then usually you togok air like melampau ah but
ya correct correct correct I that one I fully agree ah kan I mean cause banyak orang banyak orang tak
tak begitu informed lah about this kind of stuff ah so
it is the right way lah is to jangan minum banyak ah you have to conserve
like macam
kena full cool down mode already ah
no it's not it's not cause you drink to little lah it's cause you you minum melampau ah basically
ah that's true lah cause kalau kau minum banyak kan the you're over dependence on water is the thing that will make
kau punya badan is like you know get gets in a shock
uh so the more you biasakan with more water then the more likely you will
kenakan the effects of that heatstroke ah
ni semua kena belajar ah
mm yang tepat ah
oh the biji ah biji
biji-biji kecil ah
the biji take out then you blend the kulit but but then
bila kau minum kan
oh do you blend the kulit ah
but kau kena
kau kena like see first lah whether this the the type of fruit
already has natural sugars ah before kau tambah extra sugar or anything lah when you blend
with the sugar level already dah cukup already
tak payah tambah extra stuff
ah lain
err grapefruit is besar sikit
sama sama ya
ya it's uh pelik sia
ya but kau kena potong ah before you put dalam you punya blender
oh sekejap jer kan rasa dah dua ribu dua puluh satu dah
kan dia macam january february march december terus
tu ah
target berapa target
wow eh tapi kan khairul aming buat kan fifteen dua bulan tau ah tak dia memang dia memang makan sihat eat clean and he did skipping like for every day
ah but memang kak long vegetarian kot of course you can do it
mm menarik menarik
of course I have a lot tapi kita kena prioritise lah kan mana yang for this year and nanti next next year kita buat lagi yang lain kan
okay before this rasa boleh survive lima ratus sebulan sekarang gaji pun tak cukup untuk survive bulan-bulan so plan resolution untuk dua ribu dua puluh satu adalah untuk
mm make my own business uh untuk for side income lah part time lah part time for fun
mm ada two things actually which is dah started dah pun ah macam tu tapi kita
kita slow slow lah menapak kita punya business kan first uh untuk buat surprise delivery
sebenarnya kan nak buat surprise delivery ni I tak rasa pun nak buat
dia bukannya more to untuk duit tau it is just that I feel happy to see people happy
faham ke ha macam pergi delivery pergi pergi buat delivery kat orang nanti orang tu surprise eh dapat happy dapat surprise gitu kan macam seronoknya macam tu lah lagi satu the
the other part yang best sebab selepas delivery ini adalah bila kita
pack surprise tu kan so kalau orang tu order nak ni ni ni kita pack dia punya surprise box tu kan bila pack tu rasa macam
uh we pour love in that box faham ke
boleh customise lah sebab kita tak nak macam idea macam mana eh kita nak every gift tu comes with thought
orang tu sendiri fikir dia nak bagi hadiah apa bukannya dia dia bagi bulat-bulat kat kita oh okay uh I nak set A dah let's say macam tu kan which is set A dia memang kita dah provide
then it dia macam tak comes from heart truly tau ha
ha kita macam gift creator lah macam tu
everything is possible apa jer orang tu nak kita akan make it happen kan
end of november tahun lepas kot start
ah ada dua customer and more to come
hmm betul
then satu bila macam selalunya kita surprise delivery orang yang order surprise delivery ni orang yang tak boleh nak pergi hantar sendiri
so dia part oh part yang orang tu pergi hantar part tu dah tak ada tau untuk orang tu bagi dekat but macam nice ah kita nak bagi kat orang kan
so part yang kita pergi hantar barang tu dah tak ada which is dalam surprise tu satu part tu dah tak ada kita tolong buatkan that's why customisation tu penting maksudnya orang yang nak bagi hadiah tu
dia memang gift put in thoughts dalam apa yang dia nak bagi orang tu walaupun dia tak boleh hantar sendiri tapi thoughts tu ada ah
a'ah dia bukan the for the sake of just giving but giving with means lah macam tu
nama dia kotak riang okay boleh search kat Instagram pada kotak riang okay
yes that's right tu satu second is
err ni macam baru jer start like semalam first of january err a'ah but err this one
tak tak tak buat sendiri lah just drop ship barang orang lah kan err nak jual healthy food
uh dia uh makanan-makanan yang orang yang nak diet orang yang nak sihat cari faham ke
dia sugar free punya products ah
ah betul macam apa konjac mee tu kan
yes yes ada ada err antara barang yang angah drop ship
yang no sugar
but it taste like the real peanut butter ada peanut butter ada almond butter chocolate yang macam Nutella pun ada
but semua yup sugar free
okay so next next ada resolution ada
I think that's good and actually cakap pasal nak
betul and it's not something wrong pun
betul and it give benefits to other people as well
betul kita pun Google dulu
mmhmm kan selain daripada save money maybe you can gain some money as well mm mm
yes dah it's two thousand and twenty one healthy and rich
ya as in dia kan dia macam ni tau err plot twist dia maksudnya ya I have everything in plan but I want all my plan to be plot twisted in a good way maybe I have I have expectation at eighty percent maybe
ah ada ada
entah lah resolution ni
main sukan lah berdebat lah apa semua kan so it was very interesting life
interesting as well because I have my own money kan very interesting tapi
come back at home like for six and then at ten dah kelat sebab penat and that is very non healthy lifestyle for me lah so in twenty twenty one my resolution is to have
no no that's not the I want some me time yang can benefit myself as well bukan macam me time just leisure time lepak-lepak tak ada tak ada
a'ah betul dulu ingatkan abah kan main guitar kan then semua anak-anak abah ni kan angah sorang jer yang
ada keinginan nak main guitar kecil-kecil dulu kan
so I yes darjah darjah enam kat kedah dulu
mm menarik a'ah betul
mmhmm ye betul
ya uh huh tu clarinet clarinet tu ni lah ah betul lah squidward
something yang dah ada base eh
ada satu yang angah teringin nak err enroll in mandarin class a'ah I don't know ah I think I really I really have strong interest in language
betul lah I I really learn to love new language I think mandarin err is my choice right now because
apa dia a'ah
ah tengok
mm betul tiba-tiba dah berjaya
and one more thing I think macam macam kak long kata lah belum kaya lagi kan but in the process in the journey sepanjang-panjang nak jadi kaya tu
you actually contribute a lot to the society mm from the the fundraising that you made or daripada the job that you created for other people
you know those small small things actually walaupun tak kaya but it means a lot kan
mm betul
mmhmm betul
what is your advice for a startup macam angah
tapi cakap pasal start up tadi kan sampai sekarang tak puas hati lagi tau
han ji pyeong patut jadi hero
mmhmm betul
pasal dia dah bring the character tu
a'ah betul
betul lah tu tapi nam do san tu hais geram jer lah tengok
um ni macam very small small small thing tapi important lah
tak nak procrastinate ah
kan sebab itu lah punca kepada segala-galanya dua puluh dua puluh tak jadi faham ke kita bertangguh tangguh tangguh tangguh ha hapo pun takde
betul err and I agree that sometimes when we procrastinate actually the result turns out to be better faham ke macam like very last minute tapi it push us to to make a better thing faham ke ya that's true but
when it comes to working the the the that is quite hard lah actually faham ke sebab ya maybe maybe
so tahu lah kita ada deadline kan deadline is twentieth october lah konon kan but the boss want to see the progress bukannya on twenty nine tu I can do everything faham ke
yes betul
hmm tapi susah lah
the the algorithm dia mmhmm
a'ah eh tapi kadang-kadang kan bukan kita sebut tau benda kita fikir pun macam keluar juga
pelik kan angah rasa dia tanam chip lah
mm sometimes benda yang kak nor cakap dengan umi pun macam nak beli apa-apa benda tu keluar dekat angah ha
ya entah entah camera ni so scary
tapi kita pun sedar jer kan like the like kita punya that time ada yang kelat
memang terus scroll bawah sekali tick
internet internet ni they works in a very interesting way
live okay lagi ni some people err even make like house tour kot
I think I think that is very something that unacceptable to me lah maybe others think that it's for fun but for me it's like you are showing to people how to enter your house faham ke
dah lah mostly yang buat tu semua wealthy people
ah faham
but I think kan angah pernah dengar satu video ni
err actually kita boleh set for err ni for iPhone users lah kita boleh set set for one day how many hours that we spend ah bila kita dah exceed kan dia akan keluar notification that you have exceed the the total hours of err social media or something like that lah for today
hmm boleh boleh set dekat phone I think we can also keep track lah on that day how many how many time on the day how many time how many hours
ya we we are adults takkan nak ada parental control lagi
a'ah oh ye ah
eh seronok lah
eh orang nak tengok nak try ah
menarik ah
kan I think that this is how we would faham ke
kita akan more determined
if we can see what is the result faham ke kalau kita macam okay four hours nak concentrate kita tak dapat sebab kita tak nampak apa-apa kita tak boleh nak materialise benda tu tau
ha oh walaupun apps yang acknowledge pun it's enough
betul betul betul betul kan kita manusia memang mcam tu ah
ah apa dia
oi menarik
kadang-kadang kita nak tengok waktu pukul berapa sekali a'ah lepas a'ah betul
betul yes
that's correct anyway cakap pasal kucing tadi dah entah lah kucing ni kan diorang ni macam addictive eh
ya ikut suka hati dia
ya betul tak tak tahu lah kita bela kucing untuk apa sebenarnya
tak ada hati kan kadang-kadang kan kan kalau kita adopt kucing kan macam kita pergi adopt kucing kan tapi kan macam orang kata
it is not you who choose the cat the cat choose you faham ke
dah lah diorang selalu buat dumb things tapi kita still bela bagi makan
but they pee everywhere kenapa elegant
huh dia kan tidur terkangkang tengok kucing-kucing kita
that is very interesting kadang-kadang kan teringat kucing ni pun boleh gelak sendiri tau
angah terfikir satu benda but it's very random lah tapi something that angah memang selalu terfikir lah bayangkan lah kan kalau tiba-tiba
ada zombie apocalypse apa kita akan buat
tak sebenarnya kan zombie ni boleh jadi ke
ya betul
ah kat rumah a'ah
eh I think angah pernah sembang dengan kak long ke siapa dulu ke it is only my imagination but I think we have plan before that we want to sell zombie survival kit pernah tak kita ke itu imaginasi angah ada
uh huh macam cukup makan cukup first aid ah kan
oh it's not specifically for zombie lah tak beli ke a'ah
war ke mm mm
tapi kan cakap pasal bunker tadi angah terfikir lah kalau kalau kita buat rumah kan kita hire contractor
then the contractor will know everything about our house isn't that dangerous ke sometimes I would think that way lah macam okay kalau kita buat secret room then the contractor tu akan tahu secret room kita kat mana what if the contractor have bad intention
ah lepas tu ah faham aduhai
oh back to cat conversation cakap pasal cat ni kan diorang addictive
eh kalau kita pindah rumah baru kan I really want to build a catio for our cats
mm betul
ah that's what I was thinking about catio tu dekat hujung sekali depan tu swimming pool
so when we were swimming kita boleh hi kucing macam tu
and and sometimes I feel like I want them to swim with us as well boleh ke kucing boleh berenang ke
oh comelnya kalau kucing berenang
oh ye ke
steady boleh berenang ah
macam glasshouse lah kan cantiknya
and itu lah kita punya permulaan kepada segala-galanya tak ada harapan tak ada
perancangan so tak ada apa-apa kan takkan tiba-tiba terjadi selain ada pelan kan
siapa ramai tak percaya time tu
mm mm betul
cakap pasal cross country kan
kesian kan tengok ramai stewardess steward pilot yang laid off sekarang
mmhmm memang tak boleh langsung boleh lah but a few flights jer yang boleh pun sekarang
tapi tapi tapi pasal steward and stewardess ni kan ada cadangan untuk bawa
err steward and stewardess jadi macam helper lah ataupun additional staff dekat poly lah sebab diorang ada basic first aid punya basic ha
a'ah betul
kan a'ah sebab dia memang ada basic
betul mmhmm
pastu kebanyakan yang kena sack yang kena laid off
pun akan start business akan start buat business
because that's the fastest way untuk kita do something instead of waiting for jobs to come to you
employer pun tak semestinya nak ambil kerja dalam waktu sekarang
mmhmm betul
mmhmm betul
social yup betul betul
actually kan kalau tengok macam junior junior pun kan ada pun ramai yang
ya betul satu err satu sebab
jarang lah kita buat assignment sorang-sorang waktu dulu pun mesti discuss dengan kawan-kawan share jawapan like very very normal things to do kan tu satu second
our youth feeling faham ke
mm betul
ya lepas tu dah habis online learning
tiba-tiba graduate online then terus masuk kerja
then you will you ya we have to face a very hard life waktu kerja without your friends anymore
mmhmm experience pula
I think dekat china err they even built a academy for influencer kat china korea takyah cakap lah korea memang
itu memang like being famous is like
most of their punya ambitions lah ya being famous become actors actress dengan idol idol
tu lah tapi
budak-budak muda sekarang memang look up to
because artist ni orang akan minat dia sebab character yang dia bawa dalam drama character dia bawa dalam movie but influencer ni orang minat dia apa atas apa hidup dia faham ke so that's why people lagi look up to influencer daripada
mmhmm betul
eh apa kak long punya macam
for our family lah kan apa kak long punya resolution
mm dan angah rasa sejak kan sejak kita punya ni movement order ni angah rasa kita pun memang banya spend time
mm together sebagai satu family
I think same quite the same things juga lah
I want all of us to be involved together in everything that we do faham ke yes macam
main dengan kucing memasak ke
a'ah betul cantik-cantik
they can remind us satu lagi satu we want mm make them
we want we want to prove that we can do it to them faham ke macam angah cakap dengan kak long gini kan mesti angah rasa macam kena tunjuk ni boleh buat ah ah takkan cakap kosong jer
