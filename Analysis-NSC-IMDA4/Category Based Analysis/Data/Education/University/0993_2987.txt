ya coming into december then my parents think about renovation for their house and the renovation is a little bit of a nightmare
not because of the [tau] but because of the house itself you want me tell you the story
no it's not haunted
not son of a peach <malay>punya</malay>
it is our oldest house
(err) block one two eight is near to the swimming pool behind the hill ya so <malay>masa</malay> I <malay>kecil-kecil</malay> there will always be like sounds of dogs howling at night
ya
then there will also be <malay>macam ada bau tak sedap</malay> [ah] but okay my family <malay>tak kena sangat</malay> [ah] but our neighbour <malay>pernah</malay>
<malay>nak dengar</malay> ghost story
so my neighbour I think <malay>tingkat dua</malay> we stay at the fourth floor so at night I think <malay>pukul sepuluh ke apa</malay> there was somebody who came over to their house <malay>macam</malay> you know the <malay>makcik-makcik jual keropok</malay> (err) they went at ten oâ€™clock why do you open the door to a person who selling things right but my neighbour go and open [ah] so it it was a <malay>makcik</malay> selling cake <malay>tunjuk</malay> the cake all that so <malay>macam</malay> my neighbour <malay>kasihan</malay> then my neighbour <malay>pun beli</malay> [lah] the cake
so the <malay>makcik dah</malay> go off I think the next day they open up the cake there was a <malay>batu nisan</malay> inside
(err) I can't recall the exact time the exact year but I think it was when I was in secondary school around there [lah]
mine was like maybe in the early two thousands [ah]
I think mama got tell a little bit of this story before then she like <malay>tersipu-sipu</malay>
K wait let me tell you the story of my parents <malay>punya</malay> renovation so they just got the key on #deepavali# like after like one month of extension then that [one] also like a little bit of a <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] cause the previous tenant they don't want to give the key to the letter box then my parents have to like repeatedly ask for it <malay>sebab dorang dah</malay> change <malay>dorang punya</malay> address
<malay>abeh entah</malay> [lah] like very #niao# [ah] so after that eventually they wanted to give the key on fifteen of november #deepavali# is fourteen but their agreement is only until fourteen of november so obviously my parents not happy it's just one day but then that weekend is a weekend <malay>yang</malay> they wanted to clean up the house cause sixteen november they will start the renovation already
so (err) eventually on fourteen november they got the key then (um) we went to the house the next day #taufik# <malay>pun pergi</malay> the house used to house twenty cats in the master bedroom
it was super smelly then the toilet was also super smelly we wash the master bedroom a few times everytime <malay>cuci</malay> [jer] <malay>keluar</malay> like black black black it's a few times you know then we went to pet store to <malay>beli</malay> the odour eliminator [ah] spray around a few times I think (err) we went on sunday last spray for the things then (err) I went again on monday
the next day [ah] the next day <malay>bau masih tak hilang</malay> [ah] cause twenty cats [seh] so spray spray spray <malay>lagi</malay> still <malay>tak hilang abeh bila</malay> I <malay>balik</malay> I was like having like a huge headache then (err) eventually I call (err) <malay>macam</malay> professional cleaning service
like they really will use an ozone generator to produce ozone to shock the smell and then they will they use a chemical atomiser <malay>juga</malay> so the chemical they break it down into like super super small molecule so that it can go into the porous surfaces [ah] so yesterday the person came the person it's a malay guy then the <malay>masuk</malay> the <malay>nak buat dia</malay> [eh]
<malay>tanya</malay> [eh] <malay>ni ada berapa kucing ni</malay> [seh] <malay>lepas tu</malay> I <malay>cakap dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>ada ada</malay> twenty cats <malay>dia macam</malay> !wah! <malay>teruk</malay> [seh] but he was like telling us that (err) okay [ah] the smell can be removed so he did all the things and then as he was doing it suddenly he went to one of the switch so <malay>dia pergi dekat</malay> switch then he call us [lah] say [eh] I think this house <malay>ada pijat punya</malay> infestation <malay>juga</malay>
because apparently on top of the switch <malay>ada</malay> colour black black black which is actually an indication of <malay>tahi pijat</malay> [ah] so he was like hopefully all the <malay>pijat bila orang tu angkat dah bawa sekali</malay> [ah] the all the bed bugs <malay>semua</malay> but we don't know whether inside the switch plug itself there will be <malay>pijat</malay> or not so yes but yesterday my mum <malay>pergi dah tak ada</malay> the smell <malay>sangat</malay> so I guess it worked but
hopefully the smell won't stay [lah]
ya (err) the <malay>pijat</malay> is at the switch so the electrician also came over yesterday was thursday wednesday the electrician came over on wednesday to to to ask what to change [ah] so we are changing the all the switches also just to be safer ya
they when they went <malay>tak ada</malay> the smell <malay>sangat</malay> and then <malay>macam</malay> (um) I think they hide the cats or they spray something on top but <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>macam dua tiga ekor kucing kat</malay> the living room so <malay>macam</malay> we thought it was only two or three cats right so okay [lah] but end up the cause they went again <malay>macam</malay>
after they got the keys then the people ask for extension [kan] so during that period of time they ask whether can go over to the house to like do measurements for the renovation so initially they didn't allow [lah] <malay>dorang tak kasi</malay> then <malay>dah jadi</malay> my parents house <malay>apa</malay> so my parents <malay>pergi tu yang</malay> they were shocked
to see like twenty cats there !oi! <malay>kalau</malay> I think if my parents <malay>tahu pun</malay> they wouldn't have the house [lah] but no <malay>momok</malay> so it's okay
kencing kucing tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>jangan kencing hantu ke apa ke</malay>
ya
<malay>apa bunyi tu</malay>
okay [lah] okay how's your job finding going on

okay mendaki
and as in mendaki sense what mendaki sense <malay>pun dorang</malay> will go to like some companies
!aduh! <malay>entah</malay> [lah]
I initially I was also thinking whether I should find a like a full time job cause now mine is adjunct right but then now my adjunct is getting too busy
or not really I mean <malay>tak ada</malay> bonus [ah] and all that <malay>apa</malay> ya as long as still something [ah] like my dad got a job my dad [kan] <malay>masa tu kena</malay> retire he got a job <malay>pun tu tak dapat</malay> bonus <malay>ke apa</malay> so that [one] is that only contract for one year ya
ya hopefully everything get better
[oh] that time my brother my brother is still stuck in qatar right he had to fly back the he had to fly the plane to singapore so he manage to see his family <malay>kat</malay> airport for like one minute to <malay>lambai-lambai</malay> only
ya but (um) he also <malay>kena</malay> so even though they stay at crowne plaza I think all the pilots the flight attendants <malay>semua kena</malay> stay at crowne plaza so ya [lah] they only like <malay>macam</malay> see each other <malay>bila</malay> my brother <malay>keluar dari</malay> the sky train then my sister-in-law and the ya and his (uh) daughter <malay>cuma lambai</malay>
his family had been here since march so my brother has been stuck in qatar for seven months without family
but <malay>tak boleh jumpa</malay> [what] is in different room so what my sister-in-law did was she my my brother <malay>dah lama tak makan makanan melayu</malay> right so
he requested for <malay>nasi lemak</malay> on the first for the breakfast then for lunch he asked for <malay>apa benda tu nasi ambeng</malay> or is it #laksa# one of it [lah] then <malay>malam</malay> he asked for <malay>bandung</malay>
missing all the local food simon to either <malay>macam</malay> like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
(err) they have malaysian restaurant there but then it's still <malay>macam makanan</malay> the variety is not as much [lah] ya
I am not the target audience
what [oh] mama high class you <malay>tak tahu ke</malay>
ya precisely is what five digit figure [eh] I don't know
okay [lah] still not worthy
because ya we are not the target audience
I I was about to ask halal or not halal
mama very particular [what]
ya I agree
ya but mama high class [lah] that time [ah] she was watching her japan show [eh] at at your house [lah] then she texted me (err) #nura# <malay>masa tu kita ada</malay> stay <malay>dekat</malay> hotel #tokyo# one one of the #atas# hotel [lah] then I say no we didn't stay at the #atas# hotel we stayed at another like the same branch but the cheaper version then she was like !wah! <malay>situ ada makanan</malay> halal
<malay>abeh</malay> I said but we also eat <malay>makanan halal apa</malay>
ya [lah] but maybe let mama stay in dorm try
actually if <malay>apa</malay> right if you just go with your parents type or my parents we could have stayed in Airbnb [ah] then can cook and all that
but the thing is mama is not very <malay>macam</malay> open to try food ya it's like <malay>macam</malay> she said like <malay>macam</malay> okay for example like when she went vulcans right I ask her so did you eat like vulcan food then she said actually not really [lah] we just eat like indian food all this thing then I ask mama like what's the point [kan] you're supposed to go like if you go to greece you're supposed to eat greek food you know but then you just go there you end up eating tandoori chicken which you can also eat in singapore
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> #ramen# <malay>tu</malay>
surprisingly she eats #ramen# right but she doesn't eat (um) sushi #sashimi# [kan]
[oh] <malay>kita orang tak bawa pergi</malay> [ah] #sashimi# sushi restaurant that time we ate tempura ya #ramen# #miso# but not sushi she say she [oh] <malay>tak makan</malay> seaweed [kan] so <malay>tak bawa</malay> [ah] but all the rest <malay>dorang makan banyak</malay> obese <malay>apa</malay>
no idea ya like even the (um) <malay>balik punya</malay> flight she was like she said she eat a lot finish up the food all
okay [lah] some aeroplane food is nice
qatar flight food is quite shiok
I agree [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>nasi lemak</malay> I still prefer the silk air <malay>punya</malay> have you tried [ah]
[oh] my god the silk air <malay>punya</malay> is so nice ya [oh] I think out of all the (err) <malay>nasi lemak</malay> okay [ah] not counting like parents masak semua</malay> [kan] silk air <malay>nasi lemak</malay> is like up there ya but you cannot choose [what] so depends on your luck whether you will get the silk air with <malay>nasi lemak</malay> or not
like people say malaysia <malay>punya nasi lemak sedap</malay> [kan] I think silk air [one] that [one] is <malay>sedap</malay>
so I was telling #taufik# like maldives [kan] <malay>ada banyak</malay> island [kan] like can you open up one island just for singaporeans <malay>untuk</malay> okay [what]
right so like when the flight come like the flight to singapore come so only those who are from that island be at the airport cause to okay [lah] then the singaporeans can go to that island then it helps their economy it sustained from also
ya like that that would benefit both countries hello
I think <malay>ni kena</malay> write in to maldives <malay>nya</malay> government [kan]
(mm) now is hong kong but hong kong got so many riots okay I don't know whether the protest are still ongoing but ya I it's not one of my to go list
I haven't been there before [lah] but if I'm going there is only because just to check off the list but I feel that hong kong will be no different from singapore actually I want to go #nairobi# #nairobi# kenya it looks nice I have been following random people on instagram then they have been instagram #storying# their lives right so it's surprisingly for this particular day was a lot of kenyan people so the location was #nairobi# they have really nice homes you know it's like ya [lah] it's quite nice [ah]

<malay>abeh</malay> the later later [one] <malay>banyak</malay> like holiday people ya but qatar <malay>dia punya</malay> border control is still strict not like <malay>macam</malay>
they allow a lot of people to come in [ah] like people they can go to they don't have to quarantine even people from india they can so what I read [lah] on facebook like these indians they want to come to singapore and
and if they come direct they will have to take the COVID test so some of them they go to first they stay there for fourteen days so to <malay>lepaskan</malay> the requirement of the singapore government [ah] <malay>lepas tu baru</malay> they fly to singapore expert
okay [lah] not expert but ya that's what they did I mean I was reading the there's this facebook group called the indians in singapore [ah] like the you know I will read the bangladeshi community in singapore then I read the malaysia singapore malaysians border crosser so recently I venture the indians in singapore so it's like malaysian <malay>punya banyak</malay> like <malay>jiwang-jiwang</malay>
or <malay>rindu</malay> family <malay>cakap dua minggu</malay> [jer] <malay>sekarang dah lapan bulan</malay> that kind of thing then I would say the indians in singapore <malay>banyak</malay> [oh] where is the class for this (err) <malay>ataupun</malay> rented room and talk about how to get to singapore if cannot be direct that kind of thing so ya I find out that they go through

the five year [one] [ah] is one that you can consider <malay>cuma</malay> maybe you have to do the toilet [ah]
our is not cement

ya but it it feels nice right
ours is not it looks like cement's grey but it's not
skirting I think is necessary [ah]
ya
(mm) should be okay [lah] ya
that [one] I don't know how they do it but it could be because they customise their wardrobe all that that [one] will take a lot of that [one] quite expensive [lah]
ya true ours actually our renovation company is very good <malay>cuma sekarang dah tak ada lagi</malay> I don't know where they go
<malay>apanya</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] like competition
ya ours <malay>macam</malay> the my sister <malay>punya</malay> is like newer <malay>tapi dorang punya barang macam lagi cepat pecah</malay> ours <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay> the door [kan] <malay>yang dia punya</malay> handle is quite solid but my sister <malay>punya macam kena picit banyak baru dia buka</malay>

[ah] the the
ya and the brand is bosch
supposed to be quite #atas# [hor]

then after a few years you <malay>kena tukar</malay> [kan] ya ours is granite but now got a lot of new new types of counter top my parents is using this thing called vulcan I also just first time I heard of it <malay>masa kita orang pergi</malay> that's why it's like (um) it's
(um) it's a little bit more #atas# than quartz and it can go up to the wall also so the <malay>dia punya tu macam</malay> fulfilling <malay>macam</malay> very #atas# kitchen
ya correct
you you can check it out [lah]
okay [lah] I why they didn't choose quartz that time [oh] cause <malay>kita orang pemalas</malay> they say that granite can withhold heat better than quartz <malay>jadi sebab kita nanti</malay> take the pot <malay>terus letak</malay> on the kitchen counter
#taufik# and I are the <malay>pemalas</malay> kind
granite the good thing is ya [lah] if it can withstand heat all that but the porous I think after awhile it will become porous <malay>pastu</malay> (um) <malay>tak banyak</malay> choices as compared to quartz
they say after a few years you <malay>kena buat</malay> sealing <malay>dia</malay> [lah] but <malay>kita orang tak pernah buat</malay> <malay>abeh nampak macam</malay> still okay <malay>apa takyah</malay> [lah] <malay>malas</malay> ya

<malay>apa</malay> [jer] !aduh! well that's #jurong# for you <malay>tapi</malay> #jurong# <malay>punya rumah mahal</malay>
that's why after the news came out then the price went up and then news <malay>kata</malay> that they will no longer do the the price went down again then now might be up again so the price went up again so it all depends whether the is <malay>ada ke tidak</malay>

<malay>nak kena cebok</malay>
that day my niece came over but ya she's at the age where she knows how to play already so my neighbours [one] also
<malay>pecah-pecah</malay> but we don't mind [lah] cause we know that you can always put back [what] but those she's always whenever she go to a new place she will become very <malay>pemalu kepala tunduk tak nak tengok orang macam macam</malay> like <malay>perempuan apa melayu terakhir</malay> [eh]
so that's why <malay>bawa dia</malay> [lah] <malay>pergi</malay> wash hands <malay>semua pastu keluar dia nampak</malay> lego [jer] <malay>terus macam</malay> hundred and eighty degrees turn [ah] like (oo) what's this <malay>pastu ambil</malay> then usually for all these kids they will run with my lego they will play with mine because mine is construction set so that it's relatable to them but if they see #taufik# <malay>punya dorang tak faham</malay>
because star wars [kan] so all the (err) <malay>apa</malay> all the vehicles they they don't understand this but my niece she just take [seh] and then one of the transformer cup [ah] you cannot see that it can be open but she knows that you can open it up then she said [oh] what's inside then she actually open up
and <malay>macam</malay> take out all the mini fixed [ah] !aduh! and ya she's also the first one to take thanos we have a thanos mini fix then she take thanos and she was so excited
she is she is two years old <malay>pastu dah dah dah</malay> do a lot of things [lah] then start riding a bicycle [oh] <malay>dah</malay> can understand a lot [ah] [oh] she can <malay>baca ayat kursi</malay> also
ya
ya <malay>kalau dekat</malay> schools <malay>nak</malay> deal with the parents <malay>pastu</malay> to them they will think that it's okay but it it's actually like not okay for other kids you know and then they will learn from each other !wah! <malay>macam mana</malay> [seh] (mm) ya [lah] that [one] is also like my last priority
yes last resort (mm)
I I enjoy teaching when I was like at the science centre
ya there's no stress they enjoy the kids really enjoy what they are doing because for them they are doing experiment [kan] so they don't see it as something that is examinable so they really enjoy what they are learning so I I wanted to find that kind of thing [lah] but imagine teaching the same thing over and over for like seven years
what's that ya for the seven years I <malay>dah tak boleh tahan</malay> [ah] at least this [one] it's a bit different
better to do different different things then my brain <malay>pun tak mendak sangat</malay>
ya to the point where I sometimes will just blurt out whatever is the teaching content without registry registering in my brain
yes correct <malay>dah hafal sangat</malay>
(mm)
I <malay>tak pernah buat</malay> tuition like
[oh] maybe I just don't handle stress well
[ah] like you have that where you must make sure the kid improve
okay I think I hear too much stories about the second [one] so I got like a bit scared of
ya I teach my mendaki kids before and they were super sweet
[oh] dear actually why they why <malay>madrasah tak ambil</malay> like the (err) trained teachers [ah]
like now they are together under and so by right when they take teachers also they should take those under and they are not fit so that that [one] I you know [lah]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] I'm not too sure
and my sis <malay>nak hantar</malay> my niece <malay>masuk madrasah</malay> [tau]
[ah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> so next year my niece three years old then <malay>dia nak hantar pergi</malay> those <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>hafal quran punya</malay> classes all that
they have been trained
(mm) so don't know [lah] cause I think my my sis just that she's working in a school ya now also I think she see the school environment she get like a bit scared so <malay>dia kata takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>dia nak hantar</malay> the my niece <malay>pergi masuk madrasah</malay> so let's see how it goes anyway <malay>baru</malay> two years old [seh]
ya amazing
ya <malay>asalkan</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> education you know you get your your cert this that you can use to find a job that's good enough but these people they really <malay>macam</malay> plan out everything for their children
I don't know what kind of parent I will be I but I think #taufik# will be very hands on he will bring the kid to the garden make the kid touch all the plants ya make the kid <malay>apa bau</malay> all the plants also ya I can imagine that
