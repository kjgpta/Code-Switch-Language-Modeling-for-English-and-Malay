actually it's true [lah] actually mac can last quite long if you take care of it properly
I don't know why people say <malay>macam</malay> [oh] mac [oh] apple is like
it's so expensive but then they only last for a long time [eh] for a short time
I mean like I feel like that's like
one of the things no [meh] but like
actually [oh] [oh] [oh] it's just ya its it's windows <malay>punya</malay> vibe [lah]
it's just not high class ya ya ya it's so like when you think of windows you think of cheap plastic square boxy like
humpty dumpty brown frumpy but apple is lit apple is <malay>macam</malay> clean modern ya so if the listener is using [ah] windows sorry about that
androids couldn't beat me [lah] it's just what I would say
think apple is the future
[ah] shopping
ya
(um) now let's move to next topic
my wish list [eh] (hmm) actually [kan] [oh] you know what okay so just now I had my free tweet [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> childhood ya cause I ya [lah]
do you know like in like
twitter account I don't need no I don't this is my like (uh) local account
okay well ya it's fine
anyway anyway ya it's very dead [lah] cause I don't tweet a lot I only retweet retweet <malay>gitu</malay> and <malay>itu pun macam</malay> when my K pop account is dead ya so then I switch to the local but them (um)
so I tweeted
(uh) once in a blue moon can and then today was a blue moon so I tweeted that
how I realise that I like
pastel colours and
I had a happy moment cause I was just like
I'm thinking of colour combinations so speaking of that ya ya but also like things [lah] like
objects or like the interior design I think it's so pretty like for example <malay>macam</malay> a light pastel mint green with pink
I think that's really nice like purple ya one combination
yes girl !huh! no I don't like gucci I don't want gucci bag I don't think you're joking
[oh]
maybe it's nice to me [ah] cause I like now apparently I have awakening
[oh] I think it's it's a statement [lah] it's not an everyday
I think it could be cute technically
anyway so now I blah blah blah
I realize I like pastel colours then I was thinking of outfits and then I went to pinterest and then I was like [oh] and then wanted to taste like [oh] what I feel like I need purple jeans like lilac jeans
and like I see people wear and like not bad [oh] my god [oh] my god so I went to carousell and buy
was dumb
purple jeans and then ya that was why like you know that the pre order china time
for seventeen dollars so might buy that no I haven't yet like twenty five
okay white okay and another darker shade of purple on top
(um) I can simply buy it no problem I can wear with my green tops
it's the way to go it's the new mix match
<malay>apa kau merepek</malay>
okay [lah] barney is just
figment of imagination anyway ya and when the kids grow up their imagination dies
but there are new kids
<malay>macam</malay> (um) theory <malay>apa itu</malay>
ya but but <malay>dulu mana ada cakap pasal</malay> barney <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] maybe like K one maybe <malay>ada</malay> but I don't think it's about barney barney brigade
anyway ya
purple and yellow
I mean it's not like <malay>macam</malay> I mean even if it's yellow or like this green right it's not just yellow green it's like how you balance it maybe it's like a yellow jacket or
a yellow detail you know it's about those things delay fashion
(uh) you need to be coached
really
well ya so that was like
live wish list ya purple pants ya but I don't really have any other wish list
like
maybe that that <malay>apa</malay> (err)
[oh] ya crocs
ya ya
I don't really have
jewellery jewellery jewellery jewellery
like it doesn't give me the also my place got a lot already
and my rings like
I got one more but they have to match with the other the thing is that's a bit hard
for my birthday present ring you know
you don't know
the one that's a bit too big and then like it all jam ya ya ya ya ya that one is pretty but I find it hard I don't know where to wear
I mean ya [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> the the organization <malay>macam</malay> how it flows
ya well I <malay>tak tahu</malay> either [lah] but it's just how it fits
yes the vibes

basic [eh] <malay>macam ikut</malay> everyone
but then there's must be some kind of
you don't have (err) aesthetic [lah] I think you know [what]
I think you do have aesthetic just have to find out what it is I think as for now it's a bit like no no no no no no no don't first of all it's not bad I think it's like <malay>macam</malay>
(err)
a bit of minimalism
<malay>macam</malay> minimalistic and also you know like the black rare of <malay>macam</malay> gossip girl kind of vibes
