the spur of the moment that kind of thing [eh]
but I'm glad you I'm glad you thought it through [lah] !huh!

[ha] I didn't know [oh] ya yes ya recently like one of the <malay>budak yang</malay> [dah] he came back to station what last night
then he was saying that he working at some burger place with a lot of #angmohs#
then the guy like <malay>bawa motor</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
then he <malay>bawa motor</malay> then he got tattoo then the #angmoh# like [eh] !wah! you are so cool then the malay guy was just like
#siao# [lah] <malay>ini semua malik</malay> in singapore <malay>ada</malay> [sia]
<malay>bukan apa yang</malay> special
but he like just step step <malay>begini</malay> [ah] like that
but the #angmohs# were like you're you're so cool
ya [lah] he working at some burger
like the standard [lah] <malay>kadang kadang belakang</malay>
on the arm
it's a <malay>belakang tangan dia begitu ada apa tu</malay> flower something like that [ah]
is that an actual thing I've never really heard of
that you could do it
(uh huh)
I mean <malay>ada</malay> colour <malay>punya ke</malay>
<malay>tapi beberapa beberapa begitu beberapa ratus</malay> [ah]
[orh] I know my friend recently she bought like
my friend recently bought a she bought a tattoo gun
so she's like
she's like experimenting on herself first before she
offers to do for people [ah]
no [lah] it's just like her own <malay>macam tak ada kerja nak buat</malay> then just
brand tattoos for her friends that kind [ah]
and before she
ya so before she do that she's going to practice on herself first [lah]
which is <malay>macam</malay> <malay>gila</malay> [sia]
<malay>macam tengat buat kerja tidur</malay> [ah]
[ha]
actually
you you know you know about the <malay>apa</malay> the <malay>bekam</malay> before

like holes into your body then after that they suck out the blood
so the way they poke is like they use like some
pen with a needle or something then they just like then they just poke through your entire whichever part [lah]
so while I was getting that thing I was just thinking [ah] [sia] [lah] <malay>sakit</malay> [pe] this one confirm <malay>macam</malay>
I think like this is what tattooing feels like [ah]
and maybe if you ever think about getting tattoos again you should go for the <malay>bekam</malay> first [lah] then
you see how it feels [ah]
but like <malay>sakit gila</malay> [sia] it's like
<malay>pedih</malay> [ah]

like
six thirty <malay>kira bangun</malay> and then <malay>tengok bawa mendap</malay> then six thirty [ah]

then <malay>bangun</malay> like <malay>bangun</malay> like I don't know [lah] like ten eleven that kind then <malay>balik</malay>
I mean okay [lah] no rush like not like I'm in a rush to do anything also so like okay [lah] just <malay>tidur</malay> [ah]
ya
[orh]
then <malay>keluar makan semua semua</malay>
[ah]
<malay>apa ramai ramai</malay> [ah]
[sia]
[oh] then my medical call
not bad [ah]
quite interesting [ah]
like
cause the the call when it came in right it said difficulty breathing
then my then my was like chill [lah] yes [ah] okay difficulty breathing probably it's like
<malay>kalau merepek ke apa</malay>
not <malay>nak merepek</malay> [lah] but it's like <malay>tak tak tak</malay> serious [ah]
but the call said cardiac arrest so we were like okay
then we just go there like
as in we were rushing up but <malay>tak macam lari tak lari</malay> [ah] just like brisk walk that kind of thing
then we reached the lift lobby
we reached the lift lobby then suddenly one guy came running then he was like panting and <malay>berpeluh semua</malay> then he come in already
then we got into the lift together
then we go into the lift together then we took up then then my my ask him
(err) are you the one who called just now then the guy was like [ah] ya ya
then I started asking him then he said ya he [oh] his brother then his brother collapsed
then we go inside
we go inside
the got two people
one to fight back and one was the community responder
like
then they were already set up they set up the put up a dismal already
then when I came
straight away the second shock given
which is (uh) pretty rare [ah] to to to see like shocks getting given by the [ah]
ya but the guy
<malay>beberapa</malay> shock [ah]
[dah] <malay>beberapa</malay> shock already
<malay>tapi</malay> they shock all in the ambulance [ah]
(uh huh)
[oh]
[orh] but after the first two shocks after that no shock advised that you just keep pumping [ah]
I I think so
<malay>itu kali bila dia orang jumpa dia tak tak</malay> breathing [ah] no breathing no pulse
then
sorry what you say
see someone
for with a shock
[oh]
[ah] quite fast [ah] actually cause <malay>yang abang dia jumpa dia</malay>
so <malay>dia abang jumpa dia</malay> then he collapsed so I that one maybe estimate five
<malay>tak</malay> (um) I think I think five ten minutes max until the brother found him
then the <malay>abang</malay> straight away he called nine nine five then he started doing
then I think nine nine five dispatch the near the my responder app <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] ya people actually use that [ah] do you know that people actually use that
compulsory to what
[oh] serious [ah]
[ah]
(uh huh)
okay [lah] I mean
fair enough but also cannot really force also
but okay [lah] that guy quite nice the the community responder
he <malay>naik basikal</malay> then he cycled over
cause he was at home [ah] he said
ya so he's the first person to reach
(uh huh)
[ah]
[ah]
so from from no breathing no pulse [ah]
[oh] ya that guy
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
so it's within like ten minutes <malay>kena buat</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau tak buat</malay> then
confirm gone [ah] is it
<malay>macam</malay> just show show face [ah] okay
(uh huh)
got the what again
[ah] the the one and two and three and four and that kind [ah]
[ah]
wait that was a doctor [ah]
<malay>asal boleh</malay> [jer] doctor
it isn't you know
!wah! <malay>rabak</malay> [pe]
#sian# [sia]
who gets to do as in nobody want to do [oh] nobody wanna do
why [sia]
(uh)
!huh!
but (uh)
I was talking to the the guy who came back station also [lah] so he was saying that
cause
when this is a new thing also [ah] like during out time was it or <malay>tak ada</malay>
[orh]
ya so
I don't know how useful this thing is [lah] but like
I don't know [lah] like a bit half useful a bit half <malay>macam</malay>
no point
cause I don't think I don't think anybody would ever get conveyed their [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>siapa</malay> about conveyance
[oh]
like normal alpha <malay>tak ada buat</malay> [ah]
so can [what]
!huh!
[ah] ya ya the ugly one [lah]
[oh]
ya ya
[oh] ya I #ding# was telling us [lah]
actually they can <malay>buat</malay> [ah] <malay>habis buat</malay>
<malay>terus yang nyonya tu</malay>
<malay>dia ada</malay> feeding tube so <malay>makanan terkeluar</malay>
<malay>habis cakap busuk gila</malay> [ah] so then he straight away ask the boy to take over
also he said <malay>dia</malay> [dah] <malay>nak muntah tu</malay>
like <malay>busuk sangat nak muntah</malay> you take over [ah]
ya the guy was firefighter
it's the [lah] recall
[ah]
that is for firefighting or for the medic that side
[oh]
(mm) (mm)
medical relay [ah] <malay>habis dia nampak segak entah</malay>
okay [ah]
cause I came also like
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>pakai seluar</malay> [jer] [ah] bunker <malay>dengan seluar</malay>
then the top helmet <malay>put tak pakai</malay> so it's just
<malay>bawa</malay> that one medical <malay>punya</malay> equipment bag then <malay>itu</malay> [jer] [lah]
then go up
but okay [lah] fire fight fire fight come first so
to us like not so
not so stress [lah] cause the guy do the access the all the stuff already
so we just like
I was the sec com ya
no [lah] but my is trained so it's not so bad
as in even if they don't we don't turn out as sec com still okay because
as in even if I came in with zero knowledge it's still okay cause my is trained
ya [lah] definitely [sia]
I like I mean like on paper it's the sec com take charge [lah] but
honestly most of the time it's really just the
the [ah] take charge
cause the [dah] <malay>kena buat</malay> one year course [ah] as in their attachment to the medical side
so like
but last time was to make up for manpower now it's for them to get experience and then go back to fire side to bring their experience over
ya so it's
last time <malay>macam</malay> indefinitely [kan] <malay>dia orang kat</malay> medical side
but now makes sense [ah]
ya
and fire bike
!huh! ya <malay>ke</malay>
high intensity what
what does it mean
is it a type
[oh]
(uh huh)
eight people
!wah!
but <malay>asal boleh sampai lapan orang buat</malay> is it wasn't like alpha be come like on time and then
[oh]
but wonder how often it's actually being used [lah] in
[ah]
[ah]
[eh] my friend from #paya lebar# also the madam told them don't turn out [sia]
they said they want to minimise
[ah] they the the madam told them don't turn out for call like for reservist
[ah] fire site
cause they want to minimize the exposure to the public
then
I #suay# [ah] my
it's just my <malay>sekarang</malay> like <malay>baru</malay> like #ons# [ah] <malay>sikit</malay>
ya [sia]
don't know [ah] apparently it's the first time [ah] that
only the
they said because of the or something [ah]
but I don't know [ah] not really buying it
ya <malay>baru tukar</malay> about two months ago
okay [ah] #bo pian# [ah] just go [ah]
then they also all the all the people were like
he ask us like (uh) sec com for I left [oh] ya the worst part is that <malay>dengan</malay> is double meaning now
so like the one five <malay>tu sekarang</malay> is on repair
so one five two replace one five two
so
one five two crew also turn out for
you get it
so I'm I am
so I am I'm one five one right
at the same time I am one five two
ya
ya
ya correct
cannot ya so either one either or one will turn out
cause the crew is the exactly the same so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>sama</malay>
ya so it's called double meaning [ah]
so like
ya [lah] so must just be extra alert
okay [lah] but as in #bishan# usually quite rare that something happens also anyway
then ya [lor] that's my last duty [ah] double meaning but I left <malay>tak ada</malay> call [lah]
ya <malay>tak ada</malay>
not bad [lah] at least I got to experience a medical call
like it
okay [lah] interesting interesting
I mean at least if ever really I come to a
like <malay>betul betul</malay> I need to do on somebody I think I'd be a bit more confident now
ya
<malay>pasal macam</malay> before this you only <malay>pernah dengar macam belajar</malay> theory [kan]
practice and practical
but to actually see it happen in real life
like different [sia]
what didn't you download the app
[ah]
(uh huh)
I mean <malay>apa</malay> office <malay>cakap</malay>
I think for you all different [lah] cause like your whole entire duty already doing that kind of thing
but for people who not
like not doing that every single day then I think it's okay [ah]
download what
[oh] no [lah] I don't even have my
cert for that one
I don't know I I think you need the cert right to at least go for those calls
ya then
[oh] the card [ah]
[oh] for a as a reservist [ah]
but do you actually go for the training and stuff
like the recourse
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
<malay>siapa</malay> [sia]
what did I what did I teach you
[oh]
why did I
have you actually used the hiemlich on anybody before
(uh huh)
[oh] I was reading on Reddit right
hello can you hear me
hello
ya ya
you got disconnected [ah]
[oh] ya our
I was reading on Reddit right like
got people who like
MPTY-
choked to death because they were too embarrassed to ask for help to hiemlich
like
I don't know [ah]
some thread that the they were they were out like a first date or something and then one of them started choking
so instead of asking for help right they go to the toilet to try to solve it then they just die in the toilet
ya
so then
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
that one they are not choking already [ah]
!huh!
so in the end convey <malay>ke tak</malay> convey
[ha]
in case anything happen like just cover your back [ah] is it
[orh]
[oh] so she wanted to go to the hospital [ah]
!huh!
at least <malay>rabak</malay> call like you shagged out but at least you are doing
something [lah] you feel like you are contributing it ya
<malay>siapa siapa yang</malay> call
[oh]
[ha]
!huh!
<malay>asal dia sengaja</malay> swallow <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>bodoh</malay> [sia]
so you were already were were you there on the scene already [ah] for this
this is the more all the at least this is one of the more interesting <malay>punya merepek punya</malay> call [ah]
apart from the <malay>yang</malay> the maid the <malay>kena rasuk</malay> that one
that was that was was that you
[orh] wasn't you [ah] [ah]
!wah! yesterday they were telling me like
(err) ghost stories that happened in the station and stuff
after did you hear about the one the my batch as in the one that I going to already then the guy <malay>kena rasuk</malay> [one]
ya ya that one that one
then
<malay>merepek</malay> [sia]
ya then the another one they said after that but it's only one more thing that happened
then after that so it was three of them
then you know that have you ever to the firefighting store
(err) something like that [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> there's this very thick
heavy door <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
that you can close
[ah] so like
then two of them [dah] <malay>terkeluar</malay> so got one guy left inside
then <malay>dia orang dua macam main main</malay> [lah] so they
they closed the door but they didn't close it shut it was like ajar a bit
so it's just like they close ajar
then <malay>dia orang tunggu kat luar</malay> then like [eh] <malay>asal tak perasan</malay> [sia]
then after that
that was from their perspective but from the guy inside the room right his perspective right
it's that he was
banging on the door like <malay>tolak tolak tapi tak ada buka</malay>
and like the <malay>lampu</malay> was on everything
then he like
[sia] [lah] like <malay>tak ada buka</malay> [ah]
so then he don't know why okay this part this part is (err) a bit scary part [ah] he don't know why but he went to <malay>panjat</malay> to the downstairs the scary part
which is like cause it's ya as it's it's it's like a two floor kind of place
so it's like you can take the ladder to go downstairs to the first floor <malay>punya</malay> fire fighting store
then which doesn't make sense because
downstairs is confirmed locked <malay>apa</malay>
if upstairs <malay>tak buka</malay> then <malay>korang</malay> downstairs is like even worse it's gonna be locked also
but he climbed downstairs
then he climbing down the ladder he looked down <malay>gelap</malay> [kan] then he saw like a figure in a corner like swing back and forth <malay>begitu</malay>
[ah] then he like <malay>panjat</malay> [ah]
then he <malay>panjat</malay> back upstairs
he <malay>panjat</malay> back upstairs then after that then the door opened [ah]
then door open then he like he told them [ah] what he saw
then the two people outside like [eh]
but we didn't even close the door [sia] we just like we just held it ajar
<malay>tak tak dengar</malay> [ah]
ya that's the
that's almost as scary as the <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
as my my my call
as in not my call [lah] but the one that guy <malay>kena rasuk</malay>
mine is mine is like first hand experience [lah] this one is just <malay>macham</malay>
second hand stories so it's like not so scary
okay [lah] but to me now that I'm not to me now that I'm not staying in station in anymore like <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah]
ya
K brother <malay>tapi semua ramai ramai</malay> [pe]
[seh] [ah] <malay>tak boleh baik baik</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak buat benda tapi masa</malay> secondary <malay>juga</malay> [ah] boy <malay>karipap</malay>

[orh]
[ah]
vaccination vaccination <malay>apa</malay> [sia]
[oh]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] take [ah]
ya I
I realised right I have this thing where I get headaches in the sunlight
no serious like cause when I started my internship last time my internship was back in twenty eighteen [kan]
then I I was having headaches like every week
then I thought like okay [lah] maybe cause <malay>tak cukup tidur ke tak</malay>
<malay>salah bantal</malay> something like that
then recently when I started work again
then I got the same kind of headaches
then I realised like
[oh] shit the only difference is that
the the only similarity is that I've been working in the sun
ya
(err)
okay so my second thought is that I think when I went for lasik
then
after that it somehow
made me get this thing
cause I was googling it's called photo
