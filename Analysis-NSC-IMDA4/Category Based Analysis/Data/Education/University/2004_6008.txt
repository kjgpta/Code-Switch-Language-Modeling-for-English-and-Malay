I think you should like list down all the deposits as you meet them <malay>macam</malay> everything [tau] you list down from A to Z how much exactly you have spent and you have paid for and then you include like what their what's the stand of the vendors like are they willing to (uh) and then you also include like you you (um) <malay>macam</malay> if you get pregnant then how you gonna get married you can get married like can have a wedding and then but then they will open it till twenty twenty one then like how [sia] you <malay>nak macam</malay> it's a lose-lose situation for you in all in all aspects [lah] like you still going to lose money [sia]
and at this time [leh] <malay>macam</malay>
it's not it's how can a person like how can if you want talk about economy right how can you put (uh) a company's precedence over an individual
like you want to say that [oh] because company also need need to earn money how can you put that over a an individual's loss
<malay>macam</malay> like you lost thousands of money [eh] just because like [orh] the company need to earn money the company didn't give you anything back
they never even spend anything
there were no losses
ya you didn't get any of the products
!wah! I will angry [sia]
ya
it's not even your fault [sia] it's not even your you and simon's fault you guys are like preparing for it and then like had had it been (uh) how it was planned I feel like it wouldn't be this stressful or this difficult by now like everything should have settled down you know like the <malay>majlis</malay> are over like you get <malay>duit salam</malay> you know
I told #aqil# I had no expectations like <malay>kalau dia nak kahwin kahwin</malay> [ah] but other than that I'm just thinking at my own time [ah] cause like I'm not trying to find someone to settle down to start a family with like
of course <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak nak macam</malay> okay I need to find a man <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>boleh kahwin</malay> no it's like I want to find a man that I love and then slowly everything will (uh) fall into place [lah] like if if we <malay>kahwin</malay> then <malay>kahwin</malay> like but ultimately I feel like (uh) it's important that #aqil# and I learn about each other first and like trust each other and like be accepting [ah] of one another
so like we end up finish right now where we're just trying to figure each other out so <malay>pelan-pelan</malay> [ah]
[oh] you know you know he's so cute he was like when are you going to be my girlfriend like officially my girlfriend
(err) like a couple of weeks ago cause I tell him like by default I feel like we are boyfriend and girlfriend
because we are exclusive <malay>kita tak cakap</malay> we we <malay>kita tak berbual dengan orang lain</malay> like we love each other like we see a future in each other <malay>tapi</malay> (um)
I still have this need to officiate it
and then he was like okay at the end of the year
ya ya
at the end of the year cause like he says that he wants me to focus on school and work like he doesn't want me to worry about this
so he say [ah] like let's celebrate or officiate (um) <malay>hujung tahun</malay>
so I was like I guess can take it as a test like I don't know like just wait it out and observe
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] babe but there are certain things that I'm still not used to I <malay>tak biasa</malay> like him looking at my phone
he must see me <malay>siapa</malay> text he must see me <malay>siapa</malay> call
I'm not used to that and then he's like I <malay>nak tengok</malay> your gallery I was like is this what my friends do his eyes are all (ugh) in my mind like low key I'm still like single because like mentally like I'm trying to like you know
get myself there and tell myself like I'm in a relationship
never I never tell him this yet
ya
[oh] right so anyway like in december he <malay>kata</malay> like he wanna get promise rings that he says that he want to get promise rings for us like start working towards marriage and then I <malay>macam</malay> [oh] then he <malay>cakap</malay> [ah] actually <malay>dia dah</malay> start saving like he's very (uh) thrifty like
he doesn't spend like he really saves you know like he can really save money and like that's one thing that I like admire about him [lah] he's very responsible spender so like he saying that he has already started saving money then I was like [oh]
just like
I think it's quite cute [lah] like how sure he is of me
ya
you know like he told me right (um) the last girlfriend [ah] he never they never officiate the relationship like after a few months of dating she was like you're my boyfriend right and then he told me like in after one month less than a month of me and him like seeing each other he he felt so sure of me that he wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend that he ask me directly you do you want to be my girlfriend I was like [oh] so like to him it means a lot [lah] that he ask me then I was like [orh] okay
then
ya
that's why he says he's really sure of me
(um) also like I feel like honestly deep down I still have unresolved issues you with #hassan#
me I still have unresolved issues with #hassan#
like a lot of things happen because of him like <malay>macam</malay> me and my parents like ya like me and my parents
ya we're still not talking [tau] babe
then I was really sad cause during my birthday <malay>dorang tak</malay> wish I (um)
happy happy birthday
never wish me then but they bought me a cake
they they bought me a cake at nine then they say we waiting for you to come home to cut cake but actually I went sleepover !wah! I felt like the shittiest daughter ever [sia] babe
but it's okay
ya ya ya they bought me a cake
so like that's the thing there's so many like [ah] loose threads or like (uh) consequences on some like those aftermath of me and #hassan# that I'm still trying to figure out because I don't want to go into a new relationship with #aqil# and have like all these things unresolved like if I want to be with #aqil# I want to be with #aqil# only and not have like [oh] this is because of #hassan# that's because of
like what happen in the past and all that
then on like on the low key I still care about #hassan# like sometimes I wonder like is he doing okay and all that
I
I know like I know he's an adult like I know <malay>dia boleh jaga diri dia sendiri dia dah besar</malay> like he'll be fine but on the low-key I still like think about him sometimes like is he okay like is he eating well is he like
take care of himself
I think so [ah] because like he was a great boyfriend [sia] babe only things things messed up after the relationship
so like I was so sure of #hassan# [ah] I wanted to fight it out fight it out for him [oh] my god okay I <malay>nak bilang</malay> you something [ah] yesterday yesterday <malay>semalam</malay> I told #aqil# this I say I <malay>cakap dengan</malay> #aqil# (um)
I went through a lot of shit
for the past like couple of years like since last year [ah]
and to be honest right I'm so glad it happened because I got to meet you
like I really felt that way [sia] babe like
like the thing with #hassan# all that shit that went through like I went through with the other guys like
I will go through it a million times knowing the fact that I'm going to meet #aqil# and this is going to happen
ya
it's so crazy like how like at peace I am with how things like how things (um) <malay>tertulis</malay> [ah] [lah] like is everything <malay>tertulis</malay> [what] like
how things play out
ya but it's just like only time [ah] babe only time will tell like the outcome of with me and #aqil#
<malay>belum</malay> I <malay>belum</malay> delete I still I still <malay>masih ada kat</malay> phone
<malay>dekat my</malay> phone
<malay>kenapa</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I <malay>tak tahu asal</malay> I <malay>tak</malay> delete
I I <malay>tak nak tengok</malay> [ah] the <malay>gambar-gambar</malay> like it makes
okay
thank you babe like you just
factory restore it's not on my laptop it's on my phone and you just delete everything
but I have some things that I want to keep like myself and friends
<malay>kau nak</malay> but
ya I don't know [ah] like
I mean I really really hope #hassan#
everything will work out well for him because I really still want him to be happy he deserve happiness [ah] babe he's a good guy
I mean during the relationship [lah] after that I don't know what happened
right
(uh) after after #hassan#
cause you were still with #audi# and then like we went out remember you me #hassan# you me #hassan# #audi# ya
ya
honestly right I have this theory that sometimes like people suppress their true colours or their true form and they become someone else that they think that the partner like prefers ya and then when things don't work out their true form like comes back
like you think you know someone until like they don't have feelings for you anymore and then you will really know who that person is
I feel so [eh] babe
(uh) like when he was with me he was like before me he was very like (um) cold like he's very (err) like
[ah] very action [ah]
like he's a very action person I feel like it's because it's like it's like defence mechanism like it doesn't let anyone in he doesn't he's not friends with just everybody like he picks his friends very picky with his friends and then like (uh) when me and him started hanging out he became more friendly he become more open and more like outspoken and all that
and then (err) he became less judgemental
and then when we start we stop like being in a relationship we broke up he became that person that I kinda saw in the starting of the relationship
so I'm just like then I wonder [ah] like how long can a person actually suppress themselves like what if you get married to this person
that's like trying to be <malay>macam</malay> they are trying to
be someone that they're not
<malay>lepas tu</malay> (um) <malay>dah kahwin</malay> after a few after a few years <malay>dah penat</malay> like pretend to be someone that you're not
then their true form comes out !wah! scary [ah]
deep talks okay where's the malay lines let's put in some malay in here
[ah]
okay
<malay>cakap melayu</malay> [lah] okay so <malay>itu saja tentang</malay> #hassan#

I am not complaining [ah] cause I also don't mind the aircon his car anyway I <malay>tak</malay> complain [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> I <malay>pun nak</malay> aircon the <malay>kereta dia</malay> anyway so up to you [lah] you <malay>nak</malay> on aircon I okay [jer] you <malay>nak</malay> waste <malay>nak</malay> waste gas
<malay>nanti</malay>
he is a good guy
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
but I think one thing that I need to like (um) get used to is <malay>dia punya cemburu</malay>
<malay>cemburu</malay>
like his jealousy
ya like he tells me he's not a jealous person <malay>dia cakap dia tak</malay> jealous <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>bila</malay> I <malay>cakap pasal</malay> like my guy friends or like #shah# #shah# [sia] #shah# is like the most platonic friend like he's the most respectful friend ever
then like he gets like kind of jealous then <malay>macam</malay> [oh] maybe because he doesn't have many like girlfriends and even if he does they're not good looking
like to me I <malay>tak</malay> jealous <malay>pasal</malay> like you can have as many girlfriends as you want
but as long as you know how to be loyal in a relationship and you know boundaries that's what's important to me
#firdaus# is an idiot
like to me it's like (uh) old friends that's fine if you if you found a new girlfriend that [one] I'll be suspicious but old friends to me is like <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak dengan dorang</malay> you <malay>dah lama dah dengan dorang</malay>
ya
so like the fact that you and <malay>dorang tak</malay> together that means like you guys don't want don't have anything [lah] between you
you know
we got seven more minutes
I <malay>punya</malay> timer five three two eight
how about yours
ya same
but honestly like I I'm also like
I'm also quite scared to introduce #aqil# to my family you know like that's that's one of the biggest fears
[orh] <malay>pasal</malay> #aqil# <malay>tak</malay> practising like he doesn't know the basics babe
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
ya his parents is not like didn't bring him to like classes or like
you know
I feel like kinda is you know why because he doesn't have the he didn't grow up with the basics
so it's kinda hard to like
I don't want to push him I don't want I want you to like you know but one thing that kinda made my heart melt a bit was that day he was saying that he wants to talk like he's not scared of meeting my parents
he was saying like I love your daughter I'm working hard [ah] to earn a a stable income and I'm also working to better myself as a muslim then I was like !oof! damn cause he <malay>dulu tak pernah puasa</malay> then he say for the last two years he's been <malay>puasa</malay> full [lah]
but he doesn't pray he doesn't know how to pray doesn't know how to like read stuff
so <malay>macam</malay>
okay I mean I don't want to be that girl who's like [oh] my husband has to be no I've never been like that I always feel like it's a joint effort like it has to be the both of them
and then sometimes I feel like #aqil# like morals also questionable
like he [ah] he's okay to drink he's okay to like
do stuff
but
then he will like judge people who who do that also
especially practising muslim so <malay>macam</malay> like [ah] but <malay>macam</malay> I have friends who like drink but then they go <malay>solat jumaat</malay>
then it's like ya then it's not morals but I think it's more of like his view on people like <malay>dia dia punya</malay>
<malay>pendirian</malay> [ah] like <malay>dia rasa</malay> like it's okay for him to do it because <malay>dia tak</malay> practise he's not a practising muslim <malay>tapi kalau kawan dia buat kawan dia</malay> practise practise religion then <malay>itu salah</malay> so like I don't wanna ya so like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] okay like that's your view too
that's your opinion but
to me I've always been a to each their own kind of person like
<malay>gasak kau</malay> [lah] <malay>nak buat apa</malay> you you <malay>dah besar</malay> you <malay>tahu apa salah apa betul apa</malay> so I <malay>tak kesah</malay> [ah] <malay>dia nak buat apa</malay>
not my responsible to <malay>tegur</malay> you because you <malay>dah tahu</malay> all this you <malay>dah tahu</malay> and like <malay>siapa</malay> I <malay>nak tegur</malay> you know
ya
so I think part <malay>yang dia</malay> like in terms of I'm just scared <malay>macam</malay> my parents <malay>ada</malay> high expectations on #aqil# like they
they <malay>nak ni nak tu</malay> then they will they will I scared they feel like #aqil# is not a good enough person to like
can be my husband which is not fair [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> they say that based on their own checklist when it should be on my checklist because it's for me
like I <malay>yang nak kahwin</malay> [pe]
ya
right
I think my my parents <malay>punya</malay> fear is also because like if I get married they're passing all their responsibility of me to that guy
so they are scared that that guy don't care about his responsibility on me not just like monetary wise not just like health but in terms of preparation for the after life [lah] like once <malay>kita dah</malay>
<malay>meninggal</malay> like you know that kind of thing
(mm)
<malay>macam tak</malay> sincere [jer]
your mum
ya
[eh] how's your mum is she okay
(err) I think december
like I would ask him to meet my parents first before we plan for what's ahead
and then
(uh)
most likely early next year
or mid next year
then if like in december if my parents are okay then we will like apply for house you know look for our <malay>macam</malay> we will start planning [lah] like properly <malay>macam</malay>
apply for house then like (um) because #aqil# just started working so his is <malay>tak banyak</malay>
but I told him [ah] like my is enough to tank the down payment
so he's like [oh] no [lah] but like he wants to
then I say it's fine (um) like we can like plan [lah] like
I feel like I feel like #aqil# is very very reasonable <malay>dan dia punya</malay> like
<malay>dia tak macam kata dia kata dia</malay> [tau] <malay>dia</malay> like <malay>dia dia</malay> will <malay>dengar cakap orang</malay> then after that he will like process and then he would
try to understand and see other people's view [ah] like I feel like that makes it that makes him someone very easy to work with
<malay>macam</malay> be with
like as a partner <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia faham</malay> like the what is understanding in malay babe
<malay>pecah</malay>
