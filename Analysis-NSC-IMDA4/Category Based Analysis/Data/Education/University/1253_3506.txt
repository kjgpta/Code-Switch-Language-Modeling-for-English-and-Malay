<malay>sekarang</malay> what we hear <malay>lepas tu ada kata</malay> start january <malay>ada</malay> start march what you have to start you know much ya okay the thing is
can she Google whether any provided result beside kaplan
no [lah] I mean
(err) <malay>tu</malay> [lah] I mean the the the
correspondents <malay>tu macam</malay> last time when I go melbourne study [kan]
in #seoul# is one of the agency other agency <malay>pun ada</malay> so like this (uh) uni [oh] kaplan one of it is there any other agency
we went to kaplan to register her
[oh] different uni
don't you think with his diploma in kaplan can she use that or not
to for the bridging [oh] no you cannot then you have to go this
uni <malay>mana apa buat</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
it's exam-based also [lah] I mean written written exam
but if there's no choice how <malay>rasa</malay> if
the one that those without the <malay>apa</malay> is without the examining examination <malay>tu macam mana</malay>
how many choices she have
but
so <malay>nak kena ambil</malay> I mean it's the same
line [kan] must be the same line cause
you cannot change
courses [eh]
ya I mean with this combination diploma
if she opt to other <malay>macam</malay> early childhood
can she use the diploma or <malay>tak boleh pasal dia tak</malay> bridging
ya example <malay>kalau</malay> [oh] this [one] <malay>ada</malay> the next one is this [one] is (uh) no not examinable
but the course is this
whether she want to consider that
cause if she want to choose what she want if you have to take exam she have to take exam [lah] [kan]
no choice
that's two [lah] <malay>satu sama ada dia nak ambil</malay> with examinable
or she will open with non-examinable but different course
and also must know whether the diploma if she has <malay>tu boleh pakai tak nanti kena ambil lagi</malay> [kan]
cause if she wait again <malay>dah</malay> she waste one year <malay>ni dia</malay> wait again <malay>tiga bulan</malay>
<malay>nak buat cepat</malay>
now is december
I thought she say <malay>dia punya sekolah macam</malay>
career gardens <malay>apa</malay>
(mm)
[orh]
is different course now this the uni is still exist [lah] I mean the the this the studies only the courses no more <malay>kenapa</malay> low intake <malay>ke</malay>
but part time will be what how many years three years
[orh]
but what is different if she's a part time students and full time student what benefit
<malay>apa</malay>
her
[orh]
[ah]
but the thing <malay>kalau macam</malay> because now <malay>pun</malay> she take the bus <malay>pun</malay> she will pay adults fee just no school pass [kan]
then she's no more [ah] means she's tertiary student what
(hmm)
like I said if the the thing is whether the diploma kaplan diploma is recognised or not for all of these other uni
ya
this [one] is (uh) this [one] the
[ah] bridging ya
so you must have that diploma
at first it's was ya
(mm) waste about five thousand one year I think is probably that <malay>baik</malay> go to other place [seh]
it's just is it good to sit with her I thought you must go to to the school with the
consultant I don't know then one time you just trash out <malay>nanti tak tahu lagi</malay>
ya
(mm)
but I mean does it change if
this is kaplan <malay>tukar dia punya</malay> uni [kan] with these courses
do you think also the same thing they might have new course new ones new courses
can check online <malay>tak</malay>
cause now is limited time [eh] <malay>sekarang dua puluh</malay> plus
I her <malay>other</malay> friends <malay>sekolah mana</malay> private <malay>mana</malay>
kaplan <malay>juga bukan</malay>
with her behaviour <malay>seram</malay>
not very confident
the thing is when you go outside
is different
how you carry yourself
if you don't
practise what you were supposed to practise you go outside
that's the things [lah] [kan] whether you can be safe or
don't know what's going on
your lifestyle [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>campur-campur orang</malay> okay (uh) <malay>jaga diri</malay>

<malay>ada</malay> [tau] [ah]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang si ustaz anak dia</malay> [kan] remember murdoch <malay>apa yang ustaz</malay> #salim# <malay>pun</malay> [kan] you just (uh) go over to malaysia [lah] rather than go
so that's why you have to explore okay with this diploma
what you can when (uh) other uni other places <malay>kena</malay> start <malay>dia punya tu</malay> [kan] then from there
<malay>kalau kata</malay> recognise that's a plus point [lah] [kan] I mean singapore to malaysia <malay>tu</malay> !wah! one more year
