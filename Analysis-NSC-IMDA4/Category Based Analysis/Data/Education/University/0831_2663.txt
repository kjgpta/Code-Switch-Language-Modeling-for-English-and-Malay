between good looks and a fit body right I would go for their credit card
that's the only only reason why you should be very
no I think
no I think good looks also I feel like good looks is more more sustainable
if you're superficial
if you're superficial
ya
ya I think after awhile you will get tired of looking at a person's body
I don't know think face is like more more personal and like more adoring right
ya

<malay>untuk dua-dua</malay> case I will just go for
like
looking good ya

that's why should be free
#yishun#
island [eh] !wow!
[oh]
(uh) what's the island what's the island by #punggol# called [ah]
you know the one in ya there is
there's an island by #punggol# I forgot what it's called but it has like a solitary cow
ya as in like cow
ya it's like a random cow that just stroll there I don't know how they nobody knows how it it got there and then like people go to the island and they tried to look for the cow then they say if
you saw that cow right it's like a bad omen for you that means there's like something something else nearby
you know what I mean here
and it's off it's like off limit at night
it's only open in the day I forgot what it's called [lah]
[oh] yes coney island coney island yes yes yes

I think it's more interesting how the cow ended up there
I guess ya
(oo) maybe ya
agaknya agaknya apa lembu tu nak kena sembelih</malay> or something <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>abeh dia punya</malay> family member like one of the family members is like no I love this cow let's brought over to that the island
I guess what happened
[oh] wait but I mean how old can how how old can the <malay>lembu</malay> be [sia]
I think I was thinking that like
in a situation where <malay>kampung</malay> is still
present you know and then like they need so many <malay>lembu</malay>
I mean like nobody care less somebody's <malay>lembu</malay>
#kampong glam#
!wah! serious [ah] [oh] I think I heard of that
[oh] <malay>kau</malay> film <malay>kat sana</malay>

(mm)
<malay>aku nak pergi</malay> [sia]
ya
but

<malay>ada ramai orang tinggal sana</malay> [eh]
[orh]
then <malay>dia orang kerja apa</malay> [seh]
but is it like a relatively close to like the surrounding flats
!wah! that's cool
(mm)
<malay>tempat dia besar</malay>
!wah!
that's really nice [eh] I want I want to move there [sia]
I want to go visit
I want to visit
but is it really dark at night
so it's quite big [ah]
the place
[orh] [orh]
[orh] so you guys didn't actually like explore further inside [ah]
then <malay>waktu tu dah dah malam</malay> [eh]
I feel like she is one who's scaring people people never saw anything
<malay>nampak apa-apa tak</malay>
<malay>nampak muka kau</malay>
ya I would want move there just cause it's like peaceful I guess
like away from everybody else
away from civilization even though it's just next door
and you have friends also
in a sense
but that means the auntie just live alone [ah]
I mean alone with her friends
(um) <malay>yang dia boleh nampak</malay>
singapore <malay>ada tempat apa lagi yang</malay>
all the nature reserves [lor]
right I always thought of like going you know but I like don't want to be out in the sun
think that's why they normally go at like seven eight so
ya but that is also an issue
for
I just I just like the deserted areas I know there's like a
nature reserve near #mandai# area there it's like a hidden
hidden <malay>bukit</malay> I think
ya
then recently there's been news about it where people talk about it place it's like really unknown then people got something to explore that area
that's like really cool
ya
<malay>habis sini</malay> #mandai# also so if you're bored you can just go next door [ah] see
<malay>monyet</malay>
yes
actually I don't know [eh]
the animals all wear masks
the features [ah]
[oh] ya
they do actually
ya
they should just
let it be free
and then and then join the let them join <malay>lembu</malay> in <malay>pulau</malay>
#pulau semakau# the place coney island
ya
[oh] ya [sia] I think I think last time <malay>aku pergi</malay> zoo [dah] <malay>lama</malay> [seh] maybe like <malay>tiga tahun yang lepas</malay>
can't remember
ya I mean compared to you [lah]
I guess I mean not as if you're supposed to go every week or something [kan]
thing is three years is quite okay [lah] [kan]
ya it's quite sad
especially like the the cat enclosures
it's like
as in the big cats [lah]
they just like pacing around
cause they just like pacing around right they like big cats they supposed to be like roaming around
ya
and then they just like keep there inside what glass
semi-glass enclosure
then they just walking back and forth
just like restless
they should be free
it's still around right
[oh] ya
I forgot [ah]
<malay>kesian</malay> old age right they said
<malay>kesian</malay> [seh]
what is he doing here man
should put it in freezer right
[oh] ya that's what they mentioned they got it as a gift or something
from #yishun#
you never went
!huh!
no
it wasn't around in secondary school
what you talking about
maybe sec four [ah]
what
you probably just saw like
the construction
like some hibiscus on the floor
I think it's either here or botanic gardens
marina bay gardens
timing <malay>dia</malay> quite risky
ya twenty twenty it's exactly it's like sec four
[orh]
ya so you were looking at the construction
hibiscus on the floor
but there's nothing to look at
opening
got things inside
they open the door
fifty million what
what !huh!
as of
I thought one year
who would go to that place
I mean ya ya
it is pretty like
makes you wonder like where our money is going to
plants and #changi# airport
I think they spent at least
thirty dollars on #changi# airport
that's where all our money went to
that's why everything is increasing
yes correct
that's exactly
where all our money go to
!hais!
<malay>kalau kalau kau ada tiga</malay> wishes <malay>kau nak kau nak</malay> wish <malay>apa</malay>
ya
actually ya I would also
same I would also ask for a house as well
ask for a house
and then ask to be (uh) happy and then ask to never worry about anything anymore
I think that's a lot of like
with three wishes
[oh] shit
genie
you [eh] what's the other two wishes
a drop shipper
he will be richer than jeff bezos and then I will put him in jail
that's my second wish
and my third wish I put myself in jail for being that rich also
if you cannot imagine that amount of money
then you cannot wish
you cannot wish properly
why a
every year you'll get a new COVID so you'll be a
multi billionaire
that's cool
that's big though
!huh!
[oh] never worrying about anything
having a house
being happy and never worrying about anything
okay [lah] I change my never worrying seems like
it's it's too vague
[ah]
what would I want
[ah]
I think just like a sick amount of money to spend
ya
I think that that somehow relate back to like not being worried about anything
money is like all of our issues
why
why you wish that
that's cheating
did you see the did you see there was this video
(uh)
no it was like I think there's this kid as well
there was this guy wishing
wishing for like with a genie right then he was like saying ya I wish for you to be
free genie
and then the genie was like but if you if you were to wish me to be free then he was like supposed to be like happy for him and all right
then
I would just fade into I will breathe in and die
and then he dies so it's actually a good thing like the person wish for you to be free
he wanted to kill a genie
ya cause he hated the genie so it's like quite cool
quite a twist from like
what's typically
that three wish
scenarios you know
no but like the first two he wish on like things that he wanted and like he was annoyed with the genie cause he was being an asshole
so he wish that
[oh] my god you know you know black widow has been postponed again
to like I think april or may next year twenty twenty one
it's damn long [eh] from may this year they move it back to november
and then I guess COVID didn't die out
so it they postpone it to next year instead
so hopefully COVID better like just evaporate
by next year
cause I'm like so sick of waiting
ya
god
I wonder how
how different it will be if we <malay>apa</malay> we never had COVID
like what would we be doing instead you know
like where would we be
[oh] shit
no like maybe not even doing stuff cause you know like doing other stuff
[oh] ya
but
but I feel so much comfortable with the mask you know
cause like on days you're like you're like
insecure and all like worry about people looking at you
or like worry about looking
half ass
[oh] ya and that as well
(uh huh)
[oh] ya
I think you like got scanned use your and all that time I heard quite they like making it compulsory to use that bloody token
but like the code is already enough [what]
actually I don't understand what they need they need us to like adopt it you know like if it's like a lot more convenient for us then okay [ah]
they don't right
like it's just a back the question is to like why there's a need for it
like why they they doing this
it's it's been around for awhile
like they did did initiated the project like a few months back
and then they got done with it and then they said anybody who was interested to collect it but I guess
there were
not enough people who are interested I think now we're just it's just sitting somewhere in some storage that's why they like giving it out but
they making it compulsory to be used
but I mean who's fault is that to be like pouring all of our resources into developing tokens they are like practically useless
when like our phones is already enough right
ya it's just like an additional worry for them honestly
and it's not like they very careful with this kind of things also
think everyone's gonna drop it
if it have then I would mind so honestly
I mean
I don't know in this the idea of like being actively surveilled and monitored ya
that's the thing there's there's no
I mean like
the idea of it is like good and all [lah] but like
nothing good comes out of like being overly surveilled
as in like like from
like all these like big companies gathering all of your data and all that how we use it you know
like most of it has like involve like criminal shit you know
or like
things that they do like
reveal to us
so like we don't know what we doing with our data and shit
ya
I mean it doesn't have to be like overtly criminal it's just it could just be like
the precedence for them to like
introduce more stuff to be like
[ah]
like so like have more surveillance over us like at some point like you have to
say that that this too much already like we don't want to be actively monitored like all the time
but it's about like your
individual
privacy I guess I don't know
I miss I miss cats
ya
I just want like go to a cat
and like
go play with it no I haven't been to a cat cafe before
ya
<malay>aku suka</malay> [ah] <malay>kucing</malay>

ya
I think she's like
also like very
(uh) she's like a clean person so like the fur I guess worries her
but how
but I think I'm like developing allergies with cats now [eh]
ya cause every time I touch cats like my nose gets itchy
now
last time I don't have it now it's like very sensitive
it's quite bad like if I touch for too long right maybe like more than five minutes then
like
my nose is start itching and then I would sneeze like so many times like
for very long also ya
<malay>batuk</malay>
then <malay>sekarang dah dah</malay> okay [ah]
[oh] ya the bathing part
actually you know by right you're not supposed to bathe cats right
ya

like overly scared
or
ya catty catty gets like really
no not aggressive she gets like really scared then I just really pat so like no I'm not gonna do [lah]
(mm) ya
you know I've been thinking about this
I how how you think we would become extinct
you know if like the presence of like COVID now and all I feel like
cause I read up some stuff right then they said that the future of
(uh) human civilizations will be like
(uh)
be like a lot of our problems would come from like diseases you know like COVID nineteen is like one of like
like a good example [lah] then they said like in future there will be more
of this this kind of like global pandemics
like not like not like (uh) like world wars like before
which is like this kind of like
(uh) issues of this kill would have like
the rest of us that's why I've been thinking about this question
[oh] no [lah] like
it's just like
ya I just like born out of like I don't know like being overly like in careless
about like taking care of our environment and all
and like
or
like
hyper capitalistic as well
ya
I think I think it has something to do with climate change and some shit also
ya like cause like the rate like the the climate is changing the virus itself is like evolving like faster as well
ya so like and then like we not really pouring like resources into
into that and like also like human-centric stuff [lah] like taking care
(uh) like people
and we're like researchers like
being put into
solving pandemics like this in the future
so like ya we not really exactly equipped for it cause like most of our
like resources are like invested into like
technological advances
or like
productivity and shit like that you know all those capitalistic shit ya
yes
somebody is stopping disease like
stop like the next the next american president
campaigns slogan will just be
stop
just <malay>berhenti</malay> in all of the seven hundred languages
seven hundred thousand
ya I mean like
I mean like technological advances these days completely fine you know it's like what technology is
used for like for now right it's just to for us to be like more like productive you know but like
I mean that kind of like resource can be like be put into like
like
like into innovation that could be more groundbreaking you know like
like [ah] I don't like solving or like getting rid of like poverty that kind of shit you know but they will rather like
spend the resources on like (uh) like growing their wealth that kind of stuff it's like
ya
you should just you should just go up there and then you just say <malay>kalau kau orang semua</malay> stop [ah] stop it
<malay>kau orang semua sekarang</malay>
<malay>hentikan ini semua</malay>
this payment
and then their all these will be malaysians
malaysians would be the new americans
what
[oh] yes yes yes
[oh] ya <malay>merepek gila</malay> [sia]
that's so sad
<malay>kalau itu kalau kawan aku yang aku</malay> confirm <malay>macam sedih</malay> [sia]
like so unjustified
like
he shouldn't just be getting away like so simply you know like it just gives like a bad message to like future
ya
to <malay>bunuh</malay>
if I was the judge I would say that
just
<malay>kau hentikan sekarang pembunuh</malay>
[oh] ya that's like really
[oh] why
