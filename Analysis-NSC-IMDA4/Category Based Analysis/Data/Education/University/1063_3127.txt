some of the linguistic they say
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya [lah] I I mean because they are more exposed
most of the singaporean singaporean comedian they are not exposed or they they have expose but
[ah] but they don't have that that that talent because #suhaimi# also can speak a bit of <malay>bahasa</malay> indonesia
(mmhmm)

twenty years twenty years ago
no [lah] most of them are retired already
the malay teacher [ah] <malay>cikgu</malay>
<malay>cikgu ahmad suki</malay> [eh]
[eh] <malay>cikgu ahmad said</malay>
[ah] so <malay>cikgu ahmad said</malay>
I think somebody which
I think later I show you I think I have a picture no no not really <malay>botak botak</malay>
he's a bit a bit bald
but now as age catch up you don't really recognize him until somebody pointed out then [eh] isn't that (err) <malay>cikgu ahmad said</malay> then [eh]
[eh] ya
you know they are already old
most of them are in their sixties right
ya
why I mean that's natural progression [lah] I mean
they they have to retire [what] once they they hit their sixties
have the energy [lah]
professorship
ya [lah] I mean at that age you still have to keep up keep up with all this new generation of kids
ya the what now now gen Z already know now no more millennials
millennials are already hitting twenty seven years old means
<malay>sayang</malay> we are the millennials <malay>sayang</malay>
yes
<malay>sayang</malay> millennials starts
yes I'm millennial [ah]
nineteen eighty one is millennial start
so I'm like the first batch [lah]
[ah]
[ah] [ah]
even my brother is millennial
my brother #naz#
so #naz# is is considered millennial and me so we are within the one generation [lah]
no she she got (uh) she got an asset
but the thing is maybe is not a good time to sell so
so the asset is consider a lot [lah] but
but if she can if she can you know (err) ride through this
this time this bad time then if the property appreciate
ya [lah] but that one is that one is her finance
she did make some calculation [lah] I mean there is some days and so on
but the thing is she definitely made made (err)
make a profit [lah] but the thing is if she
ya [lah] about one point one million [lah] but
she can still make money like cause I think now property
(mm)
how much she bought it
but her one is at #simei# right
during that time
you can get that that kind of house for
nine hundred thousand (uh)
thirteen years ago
(mm)
[oh]
[oh] okay
I thought you she said she liked cycling
then
how how how old is the
how old is the property
so she buy second hand [lah]
!huh!
so just just
(uh) amber road
[ah]
you said just start paying so it means that
the the condo just
so she bought it second hand
at this time maybe she's
she get a good deal [lah] because (err)
[oh] so new [lah]
well that's a risk
development
(mmhmm)
ya [lah]
(mm)
ya [lah]
but her place second floor
what one point
[oh]
her main bedroom
[oh] cause so it's quite big [lah]
ya okay but
(uh huh)
okay
but why she why she lives in a condo
#dasha# when she can save more money right
(mmhmm)
ya but it's it's expensive I think rent rental for
how many people
because if it's a three bedroom she I doubt I doubt she share
her bedroom with another person [what]
right so still
so the the rent can be as high as thousand five
so that doesn't make sense thousand five
she can get a or full
three room
(mm)
(mm) [ah]
I mean actually
ya true but I mean you can always travel you can always travel take bus take train
ya I so it doesn't make I mean it just you can save more [what] if you go go on the outskirt
if he is sponsored
unless he's sponsored [lah] then if sponsored is a different story sponsored means (err) in the embassy one is paying for her living space [eh] if it doesn't then
it doesn't make sense to
ya
ya [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> I mean [kan] <malay>ini duit</malay> I mean <malay>kalau</malay>
I mean now okay [lah] maybe now times are bad a bit difficult but they should be savvy right they should they come all the way from from russia to singapore
to earn money she
ya [lah] but
ya but she's spending on the she's spending on the luxury (uh) apartment
like you know it doesn't make sense [what]
two of them in the room
okay
okay nevermind
for six people [lah]
say about thousand plus [ah] ya maybe [ah]
okay
if six person ya [lah] if let's say the rent is five thousand divide by six and ya [lah] make sense [lah]
but then still expensive
ya maybe they want privacy [lah] one thing about condo is that they can have their privacy (err) is a bit difficult to have that privacy especially if you're russian and if you're not a local you don't look chinese you don't look asian confirmed there's a lot of stare a lot of people
be talking about them not so ya [lah] I think that's one of the things that that they can get away when they have
they live in condo [lah] so that
they are being sheltered [lah]
fixed condo
[ah]
[ah]
ya [lah] ya [lah]
(mm) (mm) ya
ya
ya social social class
and then how ya and how they how they (uh) being brought up so they a different kind of
mindset and
a different kind of thinking
so but (err) when they are young
it can you can see the vast difference [ah] cause
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya they they they have the advantage I mean you have to see that they do have advantage they have the resources they have resources
because sometimes
ya but sometimes they need the drive sometimes sometimes (err) what drives what drives people
(mm)
okay
ya but travel agent company last time yes they they do make a lot of profit
but nowadays is very difficult because there's a lot of disruption
disruption to the to the travel industry then people book
(err) flights all by themselves hotel by themselves
tours now even even like expedia
they have they have their own you know experience
(mmhmm)
how much
ya that's quite a lot
[oh] [eh] so he's the degree [lah]
during degree his taking tuition when his have doing his degree
(uh huh)
[oh] okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(uh huh)
#eton# what's a #eton#
for who what what
so it's in not in not in singapore [lah]
[oh]
depend on the area [lah] depend on the area if if they if you ask the vietnamese [leh]
the vietnamese might like my friend the <malay>tuan</malay> the guy
he's (err) he knows (err) he was
he study certain in ukraine so he speak russian so he learned russian a lot of vietnamese (err) they they have influence
by russian so so it depends on the area [lah] maybe singapore because we are called colonized by by the british and the so we have that the influence [ah]
(mm)
!huh! russia
I know a few I know a few malaysian but they they study in scotland [ah] <malay>yang irfan punya kawan</malay> scotland scotland
but is it recognized or not in singapore
(uh huh)
but then how do they convert
how do they how do they convert how do they convert the
the no the what
the recognition you know like <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] malaysian malaysia hospital [lah]
[oh] okay and then then okay [lah]
because if not wasted [kan] <malay>kalau tak</malay> recognize and then after all the effort
[ah]
[oh] why [ah]
wasted [kan]
medicine also medicine [what]
[oh]
[oh] okay
[eh] [oh] (err) #rundy# #rundy#
#rundy# #rundy#
(uh) ireland or scotland [ah]
ya
one of the
ya so
I think that one cost cost them about four hundred thousand [ah]
four hundred thousand
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya most I suggest
most of them they they love like all my army friends army friends (uh) <malay>nama dia</malay> #kartik#
#kartik# <malay>dia</malay> just I just saw from facebook he
he just got promoted to become a a principal or deputy principal
so after like wait [ah] can remain thirteen fourteen
after fourteen years <malay>dah bukan jadi</malay> principal
most of my friends
in singapore
(mm)
I think the highest I heard is [jer] [lah]
so not not easy
but in in in
<malay>macam</malay> australian <malay>ni semua</malay> I think it's I wouldn't say it's it's easier
but I think
not much competition or either that or they are more
laidback [ah]
(uh)
ya
no it'll be different but ya
so
if the children
if the children want to go
aboard to study ya
that will be some challenge [ah]
(uh huh)
[ah] [ah]
(uh huh)
I think ya [lah] because the the guys are not
are not <malay>madrasah</malay> train so they have more
no no the the
#adi# is secular #adi# is <malay>madrasah</malay> then after that he went to secular but for no #ahmad# is (err) all the way is
(err) secular
so that that's why he I think he took chemical engineering or something like that
so so he he kind of like you know engineering so there's a lot of option in singapore
so <malay>macam</malay> like for
for the girls they
they're they're
[ah] because they think because they take the A level right like what we did mention right cause there's no science there's no
in A level so they take the languages
so in uni they're being offered
literature they are being offered
languages right which which [ah] no so so socio sociology right
sociology social sciences [ah]
ya so the thing is the options are limited so that's why they they they think they're going to
for overseas means they have more option so that's why they take the overseas option
