#stalisha#
my day today is very tiring obviously (um) it's been two days [ah] I sleep very late
<malay>dalam pukul enam pagi</malay>
because I started a business selling <malay>tahu begedil</malay> selling <malay>tahu begedil</malay> yes
(um) and so far it's been well (um) it went well
unexpectedly but it's still so tiring [lah]
basically because I like to eat <malay>tahu begedil</malay>
(um) quite recently [eh] [ah] like last month [ah] late last month when <malay>tahu begedil</malay> was was like a trend
(um) it's among the home-based sellers [lah]
ya it became a trend and everyone is like trying and I tried like two locals'
(um) <malay>tahu begedil</malay> and they both
have their
<malay>apa tu macam ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya kesedapan tu</malay> [kan] ya
ya and then I tried myself
so ya
actually I've been learning how to cook
for a while because <malay>ibu</malay> force me to
but (um) making this <malay>tahu begedil</malay> of course I only started recently
when I like crave it
and at that time there were no orders
(um) [eh] I mean there were no <malay>macam kedai</malay> taking any orders so like I decide just to do myself
[ah] [ah]
customers [ah]
yes
delivery is
(um) by my partner he because he also did Deliveroo as a part time
and ya [ah] so every delivery charges I will just pay him straight [lah] hundred per cent goes to him
this is only the first
the first launch ya the first week of it
ya yesterday and today
(um)
I don't think it will sustain in a in the long run because
I have a lot of things to do
[ah] I have school I have (um) freelance job I have part time jobs I have a lot of things to juggle
so I think [ah] this <malay>tahu begedil</malay> I will only sell <malay>bila ada</malay> time [lah] <malay>macam</malay> holidays
ya
go [ah] because this is not like an official business this is just like
something that I like to do and share with other people
and maybe like some in the future the menu will change [lah] because I like to bake also
so maybe like maybe the next week is not <malay>tahu begedil</malay> it's like
(um) brownies or cookies something like that
branding
[oh] I didn't call I didn't name it but <malay>ibu</malay> and <malay>abang</malay> named it as
#tahbegs# #tahbegs#
ya it's #tahbegs# is from #tahu# and #begedil# but we make it very hipster
so it's #tahbegs#
ya T H B E G S
[oh] ya (um) I also own a small business selling #bawals#
<malay>bawal</malay> yes <malay>tudung bawal</malay> you know there's square scarf
[eh] it's on hold right now because we literally have no idea what the next collection will be [eh] next collection will be
collection
ya
for now we only have two collections
(um) one is the our cotton <malay>bawal</malay> and another is our satin silk
matte satin silk <malay>bawal</malay> and our cotton <malay>bawal</malay> it sells
(um) better than our recent one
so and the stocks is like stuck up there because I guess we didn't learn about our customers that well yet
[ah] because (um) me and my partner [lah]
ya we we
<malay>kita suka</malay> try <malay>benda</malay> like try to do things new things and we try to ya [lah]
ya we like to okay the most common thing about both of us is we like to hustle
we hustle a lot <malay>macam tak kesah</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau hari-hari kerja</malay>
<malay>asalkan</malay> like <malay>kita boleh rasa duit tu</malay> [ah]
[ah] #inshallah# !wah! <malay>untuk</malay> [ah] <malay>benda yang halal</malay>
twenty one
that young
[oh]
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
that's the best you can sleep
[oh] okay okay okay
you are staying still for two and a half hours
[oh] (mm) [ah]
(mm) (mm)
!wow! okay
(uh) (uh)
(mm) (mm)
I you like wrapped
[oh] like <malay>mati macam melayu</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay
(uh) (uh)
(uh) (uh)
[oh] my god
they didn't pay you
[oh] ya ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] I see
(um)
what am I doing at nineteen
(um) I work
part time
ya at Starbucks and I was also schooling
at that point and also doing my freelance model
I start since I was
seventeen years old
(um)
there was this
<malay>apa tu</malay> open casting for new models
and then (um) I was very camera shy last time
like <malay>tak suka ambil gambar</malay> and I don't feel like I was pretty to become a model a <malay>hijabi</malay> model
so I'm like [meh] like I I don't even bother [lah] but then my partner saw like [eh] you should try [lah] you just try then [orh]
I said no I don't want (err) I'm not comfortable with other people taking photos of me because it's very awkward
then say just try one and then he post the (um) the the model entry
on Instagram
and
ya I did know
[ah] he applied to two [ah] company and I got accepted by two of them both of them
[ah] it was an unpaid job
for
(um) until I was maybe
(um) nineteen
so did
instead of paying me by money they pay me by
(um)
by their apparel
so I was a bit stupid at that point of time no I I didn't <malay>simpan</malay> because the quality is like shit
it's like so bad and then then like imagine like (um) the shooting place is like gardens by the bay then like the amount of time I need to travel there
and then I come back with just a piece of <malay>tudung</malay> for me it's like <malay>merepek</malay> so
(err) when it comes to nineteen years old something like somewhere there
<malay>ibu</malay> (um)
tell me [lah] like [oh] you need to start
(um) charging these people because you are having a lot of (um)
<malay>apa ni</malay> (um) shops coming to you (uh) for shooting she said then okay [lah] I start from fifteen dollars now I charge fifty per hour
and #alhamdulillah# it also went well
[ah]
people also come to me (um) to do to create <malay>apa</malay> to help their business boost by doing marketing and video edits
so people always see me as like the those model influencer but I don't consider myself as an influencer I'm just helping business to
(um) sell their products [ah]
ya
influencer I feel like they just
take
I don't know whatever <malay>barang</malay> that the company gave with plus money and then they just look pretty on it
because I've tried (uh) an influencer before to boost start my (um) Kamash (um) the <malay>tudung</malay> brand
(uh) and it didn't work [ah]
I lost two hundred and fifty dollars
because [ah] her charges was hundred fifty for one Instagram post
and fifty dollars
for one story
and it does it didn't
bring any sales [lah] so I was like okay (um) actually I would rate influencers is our customers
ya the most honest person and they can make sales and they (um) they really spread the word and tag you know
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
other companies ya
(mmhmm)
usually (um) before we post something right for the company we also like send the
<malay>apa tu</malay> our
what do they call it
okay [lah] the context [ah] the context of the post [ah] we
ya the description we always like (um) send it
to the company first let them approve <malay>apa-apa macam</malay> if they want to change they can change and then then we just write it up some people [ah] <malay>macam tambah-tambah</malay> [lah] [ah] themselves and then they
then they send back to us then <malay>baru kita</malay> copy paste and then put
[ah] on our post
(uh) it's our post because we are like (um) ya
usually is like that
[ah] no that that's the thing that's why I don't (um) I don't
consider myself an influencer because
I don't think I'm a good influence influence to young people
to be honest just that people a lot of people look up to me because I'm very hype
that's all
sorry
because like (um) they told me [lah] like they don't know how I juggle because I was a full time student and being a fashion designer
(um) is very difficult
(um) and it's very time consuming so
there's people like
they quit their part time because they really cannot juggle [lah] but for me I can at that point of time I can juggle two jobs my freelance and Starbucks
and like before school like I mean
imagine like school starts at twelve A twelve
so I work Starbucks from six opening to eleven
and then I go school and then after school (um) there's a photo shoot maybe that lesson (um) end at three or four
so the shoot starts at like six six P M until night [lah] something like that
ya it's like it's very bad [lah] is unhealthy also but ya a lot of people look up to me because if I want to work hard I really work
for it
I want to open up (uh) my own company [ah]
selling clothes selling <malay>muslimah</malay> clothes but of course not those you know typical those resellers or whatever it's just like
(um)
from my own manufacture from my own designs everything
!alamak! we didn't sign up for a third party
the company
(mm)
because all of this (um) of course I did research prior
and
I am thankful that my school also
teach marketing
and ya I got to apply a lot of you know what I learn from school put into business and
like one thing that I really see something wrong with my business is not knowing my customers well and at the same time at that point of time I was like learning this
(um) creative thinking creative thinking is where you
know your customers well [lah] and
<malay>macam</malay> [ah] you need to do your research (err) do survey do prototype everything
(uh) (uh)
ya
yes the sustain is very difficult
and like
(um) sellers <malay>terdahulu biasa</malay> about <malay>apa yang dorang suka</malay> instead of what
their customers like
you get what I mean <malay>macam</malay> they
assume that [orh] <malay>aku suka ni</malay> so confirm <malay>orang lain akan suka</malay>
it
hundred percent wrong in so many ways because we cannot just assume like that
ya and ya there's a lot of
that's one of the difficult things that I face [lah] when I'm opening this (um) Kamash
<malay>pasal</malay> (um) a lot of people say [eh] <malay>ni lawa</malay> confirm <malay>ada orang suka</malay> confirm <malay>ada orang suka</malay> but we cannot hear what our family members really (um) say we need to reach out to people
(um)
yes
and
ya one mistake is I listen to my partner's mum [ah] she said like [orh] <malay>ni</malay> colour <malay>cantik</malay> everything whatever shit
but then actually <malay>salah</malay> [ah] it's not selling our first
out first what [ah] [ah]
ya and I thought no it's nice it's luxurious but
but my customers are young
so they want things very
simple <malay>macam</malay> not too flashy can be an everyday wear so our first collection was successful <malay>tapi</malay> a lot of people was doubting like especially families were doubting
like [eh] [eh] <malay>ni mana ada orang pakai</malay> cotton <malay>lagi</malay> [kan] <malay>panas</malay> [kan] <malay>panas</malay> but it sell out like a lot (um) we bought I'm ten colours
eight colours already sold out
ya
[ah] we manufacture ourself
[ah] no (uh) we liaise with a factory in #jakarta#
yes
research
we need a lot of research yes
(mm)
no [lah] I mean like obviously (uh) when you grow up
[eh]
[ah] my god okay it needs to switch
naturally (um)
<malay>bila dah membesar</malay> right <malay>sambil membesar</malay>
ya <malay>sambil nak membesar tu kita selalu tukar-tukar</malay> [tau] <malay>apa kita nak jadi apa kita suka</malay>
so firstly I really wanted to be a lawyer
I love debating a lot ya I love debating and then <malay>ibu tak suka</malay> so like okay then I say I told her I want to be a nurse
(um) she said [oh] you know (um) <malay>macam</malay> she tell told me all the negative things [lah] all the
cons about being a nurse
and then [ah]
it's like <malay>jaga mayat</malay> <malay>jaga mayat</malay> and then like
some personal reasons [lah] for me but I feel like it's very selfish of her because her that personal reason I cannot become what I want to become
and also another thing I like to travel around the world
so I thought I want to be a
crew
but of course <malay>ibu</malay> also <malay>tak kasi</malay> because she say I will <malay>mati cepat</malay> the I'm like <malay>kalau ajal tu ada mati</malay> [lah] I mean like we cannot
<malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] like
those type of
incident
car crash [eh] plane crash ya
you cannot like foresee [what]
and
ya [lah] exactly then I was like okay sure
so [ah] basically [ah]
technically this what I'm doing right now fashion design is what <malay>ibu</malay> wants me to do [lah]
so I'm like okay [lah] since I cannot do anything else right I just learn fashion design and that's where I
grew to liking it
(um) ya
ya first you said you want to be doctor
right
ya I want to be
what doctor [orh] an acting
[orh] okay [ah] clown doctor
okay
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
[oh] okay
(uh)
I can fix my own teeth
(mm)
(mm)
!wow!
ya
[oh] my god
so that's what
inspired you to become an actor
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm) I see
now last time I remember the first play that I went
[eh] the first ya your first show is it
is the <malay>hantu</malay> remember
ya the first show I've watched and it was I think that was the most
favourite
like
ya show I've been too because it's like so nice and it's mix of scary because I was little <malay>masih kecil</malay> [kan] that time
so its mix of scary and like very funny then I'm like it's very interesting it's also my first time like
watching a theatre like !wah!
well quite nice [lor]
so
ya
but it was good though
(mm)
[oh] I see
[oh]
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
ya correct
(mm)
ya that's that's the thing
(um) usually people are afraid to set a price
(um)
we calculate our expenses [ah] and everything
and then we just like divide it and then we see [lah] (um) like we come up with a few prices and then we see a range like [oh] we can sell it from this price to this price no (uh) no lower than that
if it's lower than that (um) means
(uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) <malay>aku rugi</malay> [lah] (mm) (mm)
obviously <malay>tahu begedil</malay> I I can eat that every day then after that I always doubt myself like [oh] I need to to control myself because
<malay>dah lama nanti aku aku juga jadi santau bagedil</malay> [kan]
<malay>tak</malay> okay <malay>aku tak boleh tak makan</malay> but if I can
and not gain weight I will eat it everyday
ya
(mm) (mm)
ya
why is it that nice
ya but not #chai# I don't like #chai#
[oh] really
[oh] I see
[ah] [ah]
tak
ya
it's continuing
ya it's a bit much
[oh] my god no wonder ya ya ya
ya ya ya
but you would rather eat something healthy every day the hell
[oh] okay you thinking far
yes
(uh huh)
[oh] okay okay okay
<malay>apa</malay> [seh]
I don't know [ah] I feel like
even if people <malay>bila</malay>
during a sale for a plastic spoon people will still buy it
I don't know
[oh] ya
why would you need okay those like big things like tables fridge (um) washing machine
!wow! such expensive
but you need to there's a lot of electricity
coming in [what] and you use a lot of water
first martial arts
ya
I don't know I feel
<malay>silat</malay> ya but then we stop because like (um)
the <malay>penjuru</malay> is it the guru the head of the <malay>silat</malay> or something like that I don't know what what they call him
he <malay>campur</malay> with
<malay>benda tak elok</malay> [lah] (um) with
<malay>jin</malay> yes
no sister his sister <malay>yang ini kat luar</malay> I it was at #sengkang# it was at #sengkang# you know those <malay>macam</malay> got court badminton court ya we <malay>silat</malay> there
and then like I was training at
one point of time <malay>macam tengah buat benda sendiri</malay> [ah] and then like
<malay>tapi</malay> like I saw this <malay>guru</malay> and this student like a teenage student
(um) <malay>tengah terbaring</malay> [tau]
and then
the guru is like <malay>macam gitu macam baca-baca</malay> then I'm like what the hell is this person doing like (um) like what <malay>macam dia sakit ke</malay> I don't know anything but then I heard that she was
he made that person <malay>rasuk</malay> [lah] <malay>katakan</malay>
ya ya on purpose I don't know I have no idea
so I was like ya because there's (um)
one of our uncle also was in the same <malay>silat</malay> with us <malay>siapa tu</malay> [ah] #ariff# [ah] he quitted first and then we quit
so ya
I feel like is a traditional (err) okay (um) one thing I learned about <malay>silat</malay> while doing my research for my last time was
the their <malay>silat</malay> is actually
(um) how to say [ah]
they hold their respect [lah] towards their opponent
[a'ah] <malay>tekan</malay>
like how to say (um) okay <malay>selalunya sekarang orang kat luar</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang gaduh</malay> [kan] <malay>dia rembat</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi dulu masa orang melayu zaman dulu</malay> when they are in a battle
(um) they <malay>tunjuk</malay> respect to one another first and they you know <malay>buka bunga</malay> is where you show like [oh] are you ready
to <malay>silat</malay> then ya
ya <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
like are ready to like [ah] I want to challenge you are you agree or not do you agree or not ya
last time they really gold the <malay>adat</malay> [lah]
various [lah] <malay>silat</malay> #taekwando#
a lot of things
it's also for like self defence purposes especially when you are a woman
ya
(um)
but
ya
so you literally need to fly
you need to like jump and like
[oh] okay okay okay I can see
(mm)
counselling
no
for who for kids
[oh]
ya
no violent cause
no
!huh!
(uh huh)
cannot two weeks [ah]
ya
as long as you <malay>belah</malay> after two weeks [ah] I don't mind
<malay>lama</malay>
(mm)
(hmm)
ya
(mm)
ya correct
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] like to ask if you think like it's rude
is it
ya
I feel like the only
the problem with that it's just the people
they cannot they cannot stand being direct
ya
the see it as rude rather than being straightforward
like being straightforward it's like just say [lah] like [oh] <malay>apa</malay> I don't like it like can you like pick pick the clothes up
but to them I say [oh] okay I'm so sorry I will like improve myself I'll be like pick up the clothes
like (uh) <malay>aku akan ambil macam angkat</malay> [ah] <malay>baju-baju kotor ni</malay> but some people see it as rude <malay>macam</malay> [orh]
(uh) so <malay>macam katakan kau tak nak aku sini</malay> [ah] <malay>aku kena buat semua benda</malay> [ah] <malay>kat rumah ni</malay>
so something like that
what if what
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
I don't know [eh]
ya the <malay>melayu</malay> so formal I cannot
[ah] no we only speak it when <malay>ada</malay> oral <malay>ke</malay>
!wah! that was so long time ago
<malay>melayu</malay>
with <malay>abang</malay>
<malay>biasanya</malay> with <malay>abang</malay> or <malay>ibu</malay> a bit [lah] <malay>macam gini</malay> [lah] like transition between english and malay but for #hilah# hundred percent english
ya and !wow! her malay is just
I think her malay is very formal
ya
ya
(uh)
[ah] I also don't know [eh] but (um) one of my friends like <malay>dia sekarang dalam</malay> uni and he is a
he major in journalist <malay>bahasa melayu</malay> [lah] so
when I see his works he !wah! like
I feel like
I don't know malay at all because it's another
language ya <malay>macam ada perkataan</malay> like <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> and then like the whole sentence like what I don't even understand
so <malay>macam</malay> I feel like
<malay>bahasa melayu ni</malay> is not for today [lah]
it's more of
<malay>orang dulu-dulu</malay> because <malay>orang dulu</malay>
<malay>macam bahasa baku</malay> [kan]
ya correct
it's
like singlish [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
we don't usually speak like this but
along the way people <malay>macam</malay> get lazier and they tend to shorten the words so instead of <malay>dekat kau kena</malay>
did you like
<malay>lima minit</malay> short <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah]
okay I can stop it already [ah]
[eh] you haven't stop [ah]
haven't it's recording
