I mean to me it's good in a way like (um) all the lessons are pre-recorded so like I mean in times like you are not really focus during the class or the period of that class you can always go back to (um) the recordings [lah] because like if we ya I mean like
ya but you you don't really get the quality of the teaching [ah] like ya as you said [ah] traditional traditional methods are the best [ah]
but then ya obviously but then I mean like what can we do right in the midst of this pandemic like !aiya! I appreciate [lah] they they still continue classes through online cause like some of our friends like
from like ya from different universities they don't even have like those online classes right ya
(mm) (mm) and ya I I mean
I really appreciate for the university swift updates and all [lah] like they really accommodate to the international students I mean like they have to since it's an it's international university
and all right ya [lah] I really appreciate that part ya
(mmhmm) I mean
okay it's really draining
(err) cause like the
the usual physical examination like we had the the ya I mean usually we we (uh) our exam <malay>punya</malay> duration would be like three hours right
ya then (um) like this time round it's like six hours and ya there's this one subject I mean the exam was like
for two days [ah] for forty eight hours [ah] so that was really crazy [ah]
I I couldn't sleep well I couldn't even eat well or like even rest [lah] because like I mean like each time you want to do like your own stuff or like
(um)
(uh) know
ya like
cause ya but but but but it's not the usual [ah] question answer kind of thing [ah] cause ya ya cause it's like (um) I'm taking it (uh) for this for this forty hours exam is like it's it's it's (err) what's the subject [oh] education secondary (uh) educational psychology <malay>nya</malay> subject so it's like
(um) (hmm) so they gave us forty hours to like do I mean (uh) I need to do videos presentation videos so I mean ya it's
it's very like (um) it's very and for the for the amount given ya but also for the amount given [lah] so it's really appropriate [lah] I would say reasonable reasonable timing
ya
ya (mm)
ya but then I mean like if if they were to shorten it I don't think I can finish in time [ah]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] like (err) initially I was like
(um) ya ya ya cause like my my lecturer told us [lah] (err) beforehand she was like (um) ya for educational psychology ya you guys have an exception of like forty eight hours for the exams then we were like !huh! really forty eight hours then she she she was like
[ah] later you see the questions and you know why I give you forty eight hours
so ya so when I'm given the question then I was like

but then ya she mentioned [ah] like cause ya cause the university asked them to do so
but then ya then there's there's this lecturer was like
[oh] they usually ask us to tell the students that it's

I mean like to go lenient on them [ah] but then she she like somehow like rant to us ranted to us [ah] she was like but then they never
(uh) take care of their like the the the lecturers [lah] like cause they are also like going through new things right like to have like a full-fledged [ah] online classes is equally like very (uh) what difficult for them [lah] basically
