[a'ah] I tried my best to stay composed [lah] then after that (err) <malay>aku pun dah macam</malay> !alamak! <malay>aku tak boleh kalau orang tua dah</malay> start <malay>nangis</malay> then they started to cry <malay>aku dah tak boleh aku dah macam</malay> no no no no this this cannot <malay>dia</malay> they they the both the husband and wife started to cry while talking to my friend then
I almost I am <malay>macam tak boleh</malay> I cannot embed in this kind of situation because if I'm in this kind of situation I would end up <malay>macam tersentuh</malay> [ah] and then automatically my <malay>air mata</malay> will <malay>mengalir</malay> you know so I was like then I was like quickly (err) (err) <malay>apa tu kasih suap</malay> then after that I just say (uh)
<malay>cik takpe cik saya nak kena keluar sekejap</malay> [lah] so I went out of the room [lah] then when I went out the room
I then I just sat down outside and then I let them have their moment [lah] so they were talking and then the the the father of my friend and the mother came into the room and then they were taking picture and then there were more there was more crying and everything
and then <malay>kau tahu apa</malay> you know my mum's friend (um)
she cannot enter the room you know of my friend ya <malay>kiranya</malay> my my friend <malay>punya</malay> mum
mother [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay> [ah] <malay>tak boleh masuk</malay> you know inside the room because you see [ah]
because <malay>yang sakit tu anak dia</malay> [tau] so <malay>bila</malay> so she is and then she's also <malay>sakit</malay> so when she will feel <malay>sedih</malay> you know she told me personally you know like
she she try not to enter into the room because when she see her son in that condition <malay>dia akan nangis</malay>
ya ya ya
[ah] yes yes yes that like she feel like <malay>macam anak dia akan pergi dulu</malay> you know so there are moments where when I come over to the place
and then <malay>aku dekat dapur</malay> and then the mum would would like tell me [lah] like like you know (err) the mum will cry you know in front of me and then the mum will say (err)
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] (err) <malay>takde orang</malay> [lah] <malay>yang dia kesian</malay> you know <malay>aku punya kawan macam dia</malay> [kan] <malay>sekarang pun yang jaga dia</malay> it's like the father and the maid <malay>apa</malay> the maid is actually supposed to be doing the house chore and on top of that help out mum you know
but but she has an additional job of taking care of my friend [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> so sometimes <malay>bila dia tak mampu</malay> to help out my friends she has to help out the mother first <malay>apa</malay> because the mother is the priority first <malay>apa</malay>
so you know at times <malay>kau orang kunyit dia mulut dia pun aku kenal pun macam minta minta minta nyawa</malay> (err) <malay>dia pun</malay> sometimes will say you know like (err)
<malay>puas hati masukkan</malay> (err) dalam <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>rumah orang-orang tua atau rumah orang sakit</malay>
can you imagine saying that to your to your you know your mother when your mother listens to that you know how how broken she is when when you you talk like that but but <malay>dia yang sakit dia tak fikir perasaan mak dia</malay> so that's why the mother there are a couple of times already [ah] and then the mother the mother say [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
(err) she try to not enter the room [ah] because she will feel extra sensitive because (err) her her parents (err) no my friend's mum is around like seventy plus
and then like the dad also around seventy plus also so they are like <malay>macam golongan</malay> really <malay>yang orang tua</malay> [lah]
so sometimes <malay>bila mak dia nangis aku pun tak tahu macam mana nak</malay> react with <malay>aku dah macam</malay> !huh! <malay>macam mana nak</malay> what am I going to do am I gonna do I need to bring a tissue paper or what and then I just like <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>cik sabar</malay> [lah] <malay>cik cik tahan</malay> [jer] [lah]
but even the the mum also say [lah] <malay>macam</malay> the mum somehow I can feel like the mum <malay>macam</malay> somehow appreciate <malay>aku</malay> [lah] <malay>macam akan cakap apa</malay> like what you tell me like (err)
an outsider wouldn't do this to to this extend to help a person but the mum <malay>macam</malay>
the mum really appreciate <malay>aku</malay> [ah] the mum <malay>macam</malay> sometimes I think the mum <malay>dia tersentuh</malay> [lah] and always look look look
look out on whenever I come come over and everything <malay>sampai dia pun nak masakkan nasi rawon</malay> [ah] <malay>tak silap</malay>
because they <malay>dia dia orang orang boyan</malay> I think <malay>boyan ke jawa</malay> I think (err) <malay>jawa jawa</malay> sorry <malay>dia orang orang jawa</malay>
the parents are <malay>orang jawa</malay> so so so <malay>nasi rawon</malay> is like a big thing [lah] so I didn't come on the day she <malay>masak</malay> cause I was just too tired then I told my my my friend [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>aku tak dapat datang</malay> [ah] <malay>tolong kau hari ini sebab aku penat</malay>
so the then the mum said [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>cik masak</malay> [ah] <malay>hari tu tapi tu</malay> [lah] (err) <malay>anak tak nas nas tak tak dapat datang</malay> I'm like sorry [lah] <malay>cik</malay> K I mean
honestly <malay>aku cakap dengan kau</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>nak balik</malay> [kan] in in september and october you know whenever I tell that to my friend
(uh) <malay>dia</malay> automatically <malay>dia akan sedih</malay> so <malay>aku dah macam tak tahu macam mana aku nak</malay> react then he he say to me [lah] like !hey! can you do <malay>macam</malay> online from here then I'm like !huh! how am I supposed to do online and then I mean half half of me <malay>macam kalau boleh nak tolong dia</malay>
but half of me I tell myself no I cannot I need to do something from us I mean I need to push through my studies ultimately that is my goal you know
I mean after so many years of just <malay>macam</malay> you know you know that what I mean the situation of of what you are right now <malay>macam</malay> you know feeling very lost I mean I was there last time <malay>macam kita</malay> have that conversation with beberly [kan]

so so that's why I was like telling myself (err) when when comes to to my friend [lah] ya <malay>aku tak boleh tolong dia</malay> all the way but I can help him out to this extent because I tell him personally like
you know with this COVID situation it will be very hard for me to <malay>ulang balik</malay> come back because of the whole swab test (err) quarantine and everything I mean at the end of the day <malay>dia dia pun nak kena redha</malay> and I <malay>aku pun cakap dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
(um) you don't worry because you you ask somebody
you know the fact that you are somebody there are a lot of people who come to your aid when you when you need help because you think about it is just <malay>macam</malay>
he always <malay>dia dia selalu ingat yang</malay>
<malay>yang aku</malay> [jer] <malay>seorang yang boleh tolong dia padahal orang lain pun boleh tolong dia</malay>

yup you don't apply in real life situation
that's true actually it's actually quite what I mean the whole thing is quite true you know when it comes to our education system
but <malay>untuk</malay> I <malay>aku rasa macam</malay>
nothing has changed [eh] over the past how many years we've been living in singapore it is still the same concept of education and everything
it's like you know like the survival of the fittest [lah]
(err) the ones <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>macam</malay> study hard apostrophe
will progress <malay>kuat juga</malay> then the ones <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>tak</malay> progress are the ones <malay>yang macam</malay> mediocre
will just fought out in society <malay>aku masih ingat</malay> (err) I remember you know the A three teacher that geography teacher (err) he
ya ya he say (err) work hard or work in mcdonald's
[ah] now when I think about him [ah] when I think about that statement [ah] about what he made at last time [ah] <malay>aku macam</malay> [eh] you mean people who are working in mcdonald's is that bad [ah] you you are that [ah] that
<malay>macam</malay> his statement [ah] <malay>macam ada</malay> sense of <malay>macam</malay> elitism you know <malay>macam macam macam</malay> how our (err) government [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> that kind of it's like the vibe right there the <malay>dia kasih</malay> ya
<malay>macam</malay> very similar to how the government <malay>macam</malay> how the government is like [lah] so <malay>aku fikir</malay> [eh] you mean <malay>apa yang</malay> people who don't do well or people who are just average in society I mean they they they they are not successful <malay>padahal aku rasa orang-orang macam ini</malay> they are more like happy
I mean of course they want more but they are (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> content with what they have so
<malay>betul betul betul</malay>
understood understood understood
[ah]
this is a very interesting topic to talk about okay (err) honestly before I enter with
ya ya it's [ah] we're left with like twenty minutes okay so honestly (um)
K initially (err) this is like my third (err) application to you know [ah] sorry should I should not mention the name [lah]
to but I just mention the name but never mind it's it's a it's a acronym okay so (um) so before I went there in my head I always thought <malay>macam</malay> able to [kan] <malay>aku nak belajar kat sana</malay> then I'm like I I'm like how am I supposed to cope with the system over there and everything
so it was quite apprehensive [lah] in the beginning [lah] or when I went there but after I went there I realize that the system there is very different you know from singapore cause singapore [kan] <malay>pakai</malay> cambridge [kan] and <malay>sana</malay> they have their own system [tau] [ah] for <malay>apa tu macam</malay> for how to grade and grading and everything
and then <malay>kat sana aku perasan</malay> !wah! the they're very smart you know like the malaysian is super smart [eh] we're not talking about the one in you know we're talking about every other parts of the the country you know <malay>macam</malay> ones from #sabah# with the ones from #johor#
the ones from #perak# like <malay>aku dah aku</malay> I was quite shocked you know like my classmates are damn super smart
but <malay>aku</malay> realize about them is what they lack is
(um)
they are they are very (err) examination based <malay>kau faham</malay> [kan] exam yes book smart exam examination centered
so it's like they can they are they are hardcore memorizer you know their mark their marking style is <malay>macam</malay> hardcore memorizer
and of course the system over there is <malay>macam</malay> (err) the examination is (err) it's it's it's it's very straightforward [ah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) you the question is there you just vomit out back that's how you score but then like if you wanna talk about like (err) those <malay>yang macam</malay> (err) critical thinker
is <malay>tak banyak</malay> [tau] <malay>kat sana</malay>
the ones <malay>yang</malay> critical thinker is surprisingly is the ones <malay>yang</malay> from singapore people like me and my class and my other class and my other classmates so we would tend to ask question <malay>yang macam</malay> critic <malay>yang macam</malay> higher thinking [ah]
but because our our education system is <malay>dah macam</malay> nurture us like this [kan] but <malay>bila</malay> when we go there <malay>dia orang</malay> think <malay>yang kita ni</malay> super on [tau]
so <malay>aku macam</malay> !huh! super on [eh] not really [leh] it's just that (uh) our just that our culture <malay>macam</malay> singapore culture has trained us to be like this <malay>macam</malay> and then some more you have to understand <malay>aku kat sana aku</malay> pay <malay>enam ribu</malay> [eh]
almost to like a nine K [eh] (err) nine K of (err) school fees they are only paying one K of school fees
so every hour and every minute <malay>tu bagi aku</malay> is <malay>duit</malay> so if I don't ask the question am I not wasting my money and my dad's money
ya so so that's why that's why I feel like <malay>macam</malay> when [ah] so sometimes they they the malaysian <malay>kat sana pun bila dia orang tengok aku pun dia orang macam</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> they are quite intimidated [lah] even my classmate also told me [ah] <malay>yang</malay> the very first time they met me they she feels that I am <malay>aku sombong aku</malay> arrogant <malay>aku cakap</malay> [eh] serious [ah]
she say [ah] <malay>engkau macam poyo</malay> [ah] <malay>aku dah</malay> serious [ah] <malay>poyo</malay>
[ah] <malay>poyo</malay> then I'm like but but because the way I bring myself with <malay>aku</malay> I'm not the way I bring myself is my my my my like my my <malay>kepala</malay> would be like very up and then I will look at you like bitch I'm judging you that kind but I it's not like it's not like that it's just that I have to
put up a very hard exterior [lah] because you are overseas [mah] you're like you need to hustle <malay>apa</malay> and then then
when it comes to studies wise (err)
#alhamdulillah# I would say that I am coping very well [lah] I mean during the first semester I got three point seven for my but it's during my second semester that <malay>aku</malay> drop really really bad because first I was very complacent second (um)
I the the one thing that I didn't do quite smart what I mean at the one thing that is stupid of me was I shared my own answer script
to my classmate
and then it got shared with other people you know
so can you imagine I was the one who did everything from scratch and then it got shared so I told myself (err) then I was not really focused [ah] like I still remember like the day before the exam <malay>baru aku nak belajar</malay> can you imagine
but I I had a very long months of preparing but but because of (err) I was like I don't know it's I just I just got so complacent in my head
ya <malay>yang</malay> answer script
[ah]
[ah] it's like a <malay>macam</malay> (err) I based (err) meaning [ah] I I will use the past year exam paper then I will answer the question then most of the time the the questions will will be almost the same [ah] like every four years is almost the same that's what my one of my friends told me [lah] [ah] who has studied in
so and then I saw in (err) semester three I told myself no I cannot
(um) [ah] in semester three I was very low key <malay>nak mampus</malay> [tau] <malay>aku macam aku</malay> every question every every essay that I did I didn't really share with anyone I just kept quiet (uh) I even like (um) <malay>tak</malay> post anything about about me are preparing for exams I just was just very very low key [ah]
and then my my results was #alhamdulillah# I mean I I was quite surprised [ah] that I got three point nine which is the highest I have ever gotten [lah]
ya and then this coming semester four <malay>pun</malay> (err) <malay>aku</malay> hopefully [lah] I can get a (err) very good [lah] but all in all <malay>aku cakap dengan kau</malay> I mean
I don't know I don't know [lah] <malay>macam</malay> but but you see [ah] I I remember that time [ah] <malay>aku baru balik dari</malay> #kedah# [tau] <malay>nak balik</malay> (err) <malay>pergi</malay> <malay>tak silap</malay> <malay>ke</malay> singapore (uh)
and then (err) I remember sitting with this (err) with this lady [lah] she is (err) from #penang# you know she no no I I I went #penang# sorry ya I went #penang# and then I was on my way back from #penang# to singapore via flight so there was this (err) lady that I I sat beside and then (err)
when I because I was sitting at the window seat right so when I say (err) excuse me (err) then (err) then so when I enter (err) and sit and when I seated here now
you know she automatically she ask me [eh] you singaporean [ah]
then <malay>aku dah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mana kau tahu</malay> then she say [oh] I know [lah] because of your accent and the way you talk
<malay>aku dah</malay> !wow! I'm shocked man
ya you can tell [ah] you can tell from a from a

<malay>tapi kat sana</malay> it's (err) it's <malay>bangsa dia orang yang</malay> look down <malay>kau faham</malay> [kan] so <malay>dia macam terbalik</malay> (err) <malay>macam dia</malay> (err) <malay>aku cakap dengan</malay> very frank [ah] then <malay>dia cakap</malay> ya I <malay>faham</malay> I <malay>faham tapi tapi aku rasa sana pun dia dia rakyat</malay> is not
(err) every everyone is kind of like taken care of [lah] I would say I mean I do not know I mean I I I've been staying there for like almost (err) three three three years plus now (err) it's good ya it and (err) I find that
I mean is a very hustle and bustle city [lah] but the expenses there is <malay>mahal nak mampus</malay>
I find like <malay>macam barang-barang dah macam barang-barang</malay> the shampoo body shower [oh] !wah! I tell you <malay>mahal sangat macam satu</malay>
one body shower <malay>macam</malay> dove [eh] twenty four #ringgit# [eh] !siala! twenty four #ringgit# when you pay when you pay fifty #ringgit# to pay for the twenty four #ringgit# and when you left with that balance [eh] <malay>macam kiwak macam</malay> [eh] this is very expensive [leh] but when in singapore
when you pay fifty dollars for the same amount of eight dollars you you have the balance is still a lot [kan] then it's like worth it [kan] <malay>padahal</malay> it's the same current it's the same rate but just different currency so honestly if you ask me whether

and then
I am planning to do my internship in singapore because at the end of the day I'm going to come back and and work here
I I as of now I have no intention to work in malaysia [lah] unless there is a good opportunity for me but even so (err) I did ask <malay>macam</malay> consulted over there [lah] like they say like they if you're a foreigner you are given like <malay>macam</malay> temporary contract [eh]
so <malay>aku tak nak ambil</malay> contract I <malay>aku rasa</malay> it is very risky to be doing contract work and then on top of that <malay>kau kena cari</malay> (err) <malay>rumah</malay> then on top of that <malay>kau kena</malay> settle your visa and all those shenanigans so <malay>aku cakap</malay> no no no I think I rather work in singapore so it depends on which industry I'm going to
yup
<malay>betul</malay>
understood
yup yup
but you see [ah] the thing is I <malay>aku</malay> because I'm here [mah] so I am not able to network as fast
as I'm over there so <malay>kalau kalau</malay> if you were there is is is it's easy for me to network and everything but I'm trying my best to like network [lah] and the end of the day <malay>aku pun tak</malay> sure [lah] what kind of (err) prospects I want to do
(err) whether I want to go into teaching whether I want to go into academics or whether I want to go into (err) media I still haven't decide [lah] I mean
I I see myself writing for a article in a journal you know I mean it's it's an academic journal so and the (um) I mean that's that's the thing that <malay>aku aku</malay> don't mind doing [lah] but for me to do that is like I need to go into the academic
<malay>punya</malay> sector like to become I'm not necessarily become a lecturer but maybe (err)
(err) take my master and maybe I don't know take my in language and because at the end of the day (err) in language <malay>pun tak banyak orang yang ambil apa</malay> unless you are really passionate and interested in it [lah]
so I will say [lah] in the next (err) one and a half years start starting from october
[ah] what and tails and and and then you just hope for the best [lah] but I'm just glad that my study <malay>punya</malay> period is going to be be done and over with very very soon
