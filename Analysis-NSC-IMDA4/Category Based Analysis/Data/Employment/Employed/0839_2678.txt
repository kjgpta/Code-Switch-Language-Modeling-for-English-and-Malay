ya
yup
anyways
how are you
that's good
[ah] ya
I mean it's just only one game so
I think
that's a little bit too much
because like ya <malay>macam</malay>
okay [ah] I mean like
technically
technically you can't copyright that shit because you edited it to
you know
way beyond its for creative use [ah]
like you can't really copyright that shit
[eh] fair enough
ya
they can't demonetised you if if you are not monetised right so you know
(err) ya I think that's different
(mm) fair
<malay>asal pula</malay>
(oo) ya okay I get it I get it
is it not bad [sia]
I mean I mean at that price range quite affordable already [sia] considering like
okay [lah] okay you you can't really upgrade it but then like at three fifty
two correction two fifty that is
cheap as balls
the new rising five
okay
[ah] (uh huh)
is is like <malay>apa</malay>
(err) it's like five in india
somebody <malay>dekat dalam kat</malay> india
somebody copy [eh] copyrighted [ah] ya copyrighted [ah]
somebody copyrighted five so
five they Sony can't release five as five in india because it's copyrighted
how I know
I mean there there's gonna be a legal battle ensuing about it probably but
true
but then Sony Sony will try to
probably [ah] I think
probably will try to buy it off the person [ah]
because it's like
it will be really wanted to be a dick about it you can just copyright
I mean iphone <malay>punya itu</malay> okay [lah] no I mean iphone bad examples because they already copyrighted all the
all the way the series so like in that same vein you can actually do that ya like if you wanted money [ah] you know unless <malay>dia orang macam</malay> like [ah] okay [ah] <malay>kita</malay> skip one generation that kind of thing so it will be very weird it will be like
one two three four
then five is <malay>apa</malay> roman numerical V
<malay>bodoh</malay>
[ah] ya and it's Sony so like you know he's you know he's going to get a lot of money from it
really
[oh] four chat that's disgusting
that's terrible
correct
ya no okay push to talk isn't the issue it's more of in game comms has been
traditionally very shit
after teams speak but then
team speak all of this you had to pay for the channel
ya [lah] you had to buy
ya discord is like you open everything you want to create [ah] create [ah] you want create how many you want you create but then you don't have to pay for the room but of course like at the start of discord it was quite okay [ah] it was rocky [ah]
like if you compared team speak with discord team speak obviously better [ah]
I mean it's just a brand name only [ah] at this point
you know like some of the products are good but then like
majority of them is just brand name like (oo) look at this Razer whatever
buy for
you know usually it's fucking expensive [ah] but then it's like
<malay>bodoh</malay>
[eh] [ah] no I'm not about that life man
man
no [ah] not about their life or I mean
the products are way to expensive
it's not
ya [lah] I mean it is a gaming peripheral [ah] but still like
at least limit it [ah] like at at least make it more
marketable or more friendly in that sense
like if someone wanted to buy Razer they would be like [oh] Razer
and then it you know if it's a new person that buys it and it's like they don't know what to look for
and there's a lot of products out there
recycle model
but different name and then you know it's always going to be more expensive than the that [one] by then there will be a sale on the older ones
and the older ones like
[eh] that kind
[ah]
I mean I have <malay>tukar topik</malay> [ah] like I have troubles
with my current night shift
cannot [sia] boring <malay>gila</malay> [siol]
boring <malay>gila</malay>
like at least in my previous company right night shift I had something to do
like I'm quite active okay this person is there that person needs that okay got problem here there try to rectify okay can
but this [one] is like I'm sitting in front of the computer like [oh] my god then there's like four screens
and each screen has different things
okay [lah] like the two screens at the end is your camera screen after that your main working screen is the [one] that you are looking at this the second [one]
then the screen to the right is
the map
you can search for shit [lah] like
whoever [ah] whoever say something right then (err) or the expressway or whatever roads and you just search they will appear on the thing
you can do your job [ah] and then like cannot [ah]
you know I'm not a coffee drinker
it's just boring [siol]
ya but then
true
but okay this this is the thing that I don't expect from this sector though is that they will pay you
for the entire month at a certain date like mine they will pay on the twelfth but for the entire month
like like that I work for the first few one week
two weeks then after that take leave for the rest of the month get paid already
I still get paid
ya [lah] no [lah] leave
unpaid is
I think when you haven't confirm yet like the first three months
or six months
(uh) I can't even take leave at this point
I mean I can [ah] but it's just unpaid
it's not the entitled leave
but ya like
usually usually the probation is three months some companies is six months right
okay [ah] depends on the company [lah] but this is this is one of those that is three months then I get all the medical benefits and all that nonsense [ah] but
the travel expense though it's free
no that's the thing the other thing is I have to clarify was <malay>apa</malay> this transport allowance right
can use for other things or not you know seven eleven can pay by EZ-Link right [ah] I thought can but no
but
ya I got scam
the transport allowance is transport allowance [ah] you can't
you can't
use it
ya because they kind of paid due to do it
ya I mean I mean they paid
you in cash for it whereas this is more of a
not ya
like a token is a token more than anything [ah]
then it's like every month you just get topped up back to the original amount
I mean you can't I can't
it states there in the contract that I can [ah]
let anyone use the thing
[sial] [ah] I have I have to use it
anyways you just more or less a tracking system for me [ah]
no [lah] it's them for them to track their employees that kind of thing
but then it's like
I mean like [eh] there's this other card
that you can apply for
provided
you can reliably prove
that the company is making you travel everywhere
so like (err) if you exit
the quantity that the the travel allowance right
then you can like prove that okay that I'm travelling
(uh) all these places and I'm exceeding my allowance my transport allowance
because I'm travelling for work that kind of shit then it's like
not really ya watch cameras [ah]
like I'm just saying there's
there's (uh)
hidden thing to it [lah] like if you don't cause like you exceed your travel allowance
then you have to pay for from your next month's
<malay>gaji</malay> then like for what [sia]
you might as well apply for this other thing which apparently is unlimited
but ya
ya
but the thing is like you have to keep proving that it's company expense like they are making you travel then
ya then you apply [ah]
no [ah]
like where the hell am I supposed to go [sia] if I'm watching cameras all day
I mean can [ah] can is can [ah] like the
like the the the culture quite laid back quite <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] considering like anytime you can just ask somebody to cover for you because they all like okay
you work in shifts then after you work morning then <malay>cukup</malay> time <malay>dah lapar</malay> [eh]
<malay>kau nak apa apa tak kat kedai</malay> #kopi#
<malay>aku nak gi</malay>
then take orders [ah] #teh# #teh# #kopi# <malay>ni itu</malay>
then if <malay>tak</malay> then order from Grab
I mean the
no [ah]
anytime ya
and then there's no there's no place to eat also
like you eat in the no you eat there in the !oops! room itself
like you don't go out to eat then come back
(uh) I mean it's true [ah] I can't really you can't really like changed that aspect of it because at the end of the day it's you're bloody job is to monitor the cameras and like if you
are not there to monitor the camera then you're not doing your job then like
pointless right
so ya but then again also like sometimes the the job gets so hectic
that you are so busy with that [one] then it's like you want to eat but you cannot eat
no obviously obviously you eat after and before [lah] but
the during the <malay>kerja</malay> but sometimes
ya that's true
I mean I already enjoyed it
like if
but then okay that's the other thing that I didn't expect from this [ah] job
because <malay>dia punya tempat kat</malay> town
then usually town food bloody expensive
so I got chicken rice three fifty
like [sial] [ah] where you want to find chicken rice for three fifty
in town in town
okay [ah] don't say town [lah] #ulu# <malay>punya tempat pun susah nak cari</malay> three fifty like
(uh) ya
ya
like even hawker centres also are not that cheap
and plus this period some more
what to do it is what it is [ah] but yet
I mean we are more or less
stabilised
and twelve few days ago
a few days a few days ago also
[ah] zero
but ya more or less we are stabilised
we can start opening already
if we wanted to
ya
but the sad part is
the whole world still burning so even if we open we can't really like travel
right ya we travel to australia also same thing
no no the sad part is right
singapore australia open on the eighth
eighth was it no eleven
we already open so we can travel
to the countries I mean australia but the sad part is if an australian citizen travels to singapore spend the time here for holiday whatever comeback they need to pay
a <malay>saman</malay> so to speak
because they they're australia itself is not open
you can go for travel
but the country itself is not open yet
we are open to go there but they are not
ya [lah]
[eh] no
they don't have to they just have to do the swab test
then
is
fourteen days [siol] I think you just swab test to say that you are not you I mean you don't have it then after that you are free to go after that
but ya
it's it's set for their citizen [ah] I think <malay>kena saman</malay>
okay [ah] not really okay [ah]
the <malay>saman saman</malay> is a is a wrong choice of word [ah] (err) it's more of (err) ya
it's not it's not a fine it's more of
something like that [lah] like it's a tax kind of thing but it's not really a tax
but it's not a <malay>saman</malay>
something like that
ya I mean that's true
it's like what (uh)
I heard from my aunt it's like three thousand
australian
so an australian citizen comes to singapore comeback then they need to pay the three thousand
ya I know
two thousand plus I think
(uh) I think what one dollar to ninety cents something like that
ya more money that kind of shit
then everyone goes there then after that the then now is like what okay [ah]
[eh] but then new zealand that time got (uh) recently I think yesterday got a few cases because of the travellers
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I mean we have the resources to spend
to do all these test
okay
one and the other thing is we are more or less generally
quite submissive [ah]
like whatever government says we kind of have to follow otherwise we get the rod
but then it's like
that's worst I'm I was just putting it nicely okay but ya
so like I mean if you compare us to other countries there is like you know their freedom of speech blah blah blah all that nonsense then you see [lah] what happened now
three hundred thousand already
(uh huh)
ya
yup
two hundred thousand
it's already three three hundred thousand
and then the other sad part is
it's all people of colour
not
ya no that's the thing their medical system that is flawed as fuck
you see [eh] go into the A&E
they have their own pricing on it
like whatever
[ah] that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it because they charge whatever they charge whatever for whatever treatment that the want to give and then in the end like the bill comes out then like [sial] [ah]
like who in their right mind can afford that kind of shit [sia] like if you don't have insurance in america you are fucked
(oo)
you you will be so screwed
three something like that ya
ya and the thing is you can pay by instalment if you don't have the cash
ya
unlikely unlikely
true
then it's also zero percent interest [what] so you are not paying extra for the stupid
ya [lah] I mean late payments but like if you're if you're choosing to pay by instalment and you know you can pay that amount every month and eventually it goes away
it just takes awhile only [ah] I mean there's also like you know like you don't want to pay instalment already you have enough money to pay everything then you pay everything [ah]
ya
okay
really
(uh huh)
[oh] is it
ya #borat# is #borat# [lah] so
I wonder if they edited that out
(uh huh)
I mean to be okay [ah] no [ah]
no no then it's it's on video it's proof enough like they'll find I don't know I think they will find somehow or another to turn it around
it is what it is [ah] but you know it's fucking video proof [ah] like even
even
even the
the law enforcement system
right you know how everybody saying that police are body cam supposed to be
are submitted for evaluation or some shit like that right
no it's not it's not they switched off
I don't know which state
said that
(uh) they shouldn't submit the body cam anymore
because
it shows a lack of de escalation
ya
ya
and then is like as long as the story tallies then is like you can't really say what
I don't know [lah] which state [ah] one of the judge [lah] they said they shouldn't send the things anymore because it just shows that they are doing a bad job
like I mean their police is already that terrible already but it is what it is [ah]
[ah]
no comments no comments
in
in other news right whole world is burning
that might be true for #taiwan# soon
I think world war three should start soon
(err) china
planing on the invasion already it's in the work
the thing is now the threat seems very real
because the eastern side of china the one that is closest to #taiwan# right they upgraded the middle the missile or some shit like that then is like the thing can now hit #taiwan# [ah]
I mean that's not really diplomacy anymore
considering
[eh] ya
I mean to be fair they've already taken the majority of the world
#taiwan# is part of china and then
I mean ya [lah] like
and they could have just let #taiwan#
be as it is
have their own government but no
then like
really
so you you
so you can't have a people's republic of china and a democratic republic of #taiwan# like no
I think they call them (uh) D D C P right [eh] no D C C
[oh] !wow!
I mean #taiwan# is kind of like singapore
just
much bigger
okay I mean
okay let's be let's be fair to them they are their own country
they are their own parliament
it's just that another
ya that
okay [lah]
that [one] no comments [ah] ya
it has it has been like this for awhile only it's just that now only now their making news of it
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
legit [ah]
[oh] !wow!
<malay>bodoh</malay>
(uh huh)
!ee! [ah] ya
that's malaysia
that's the issue I mean
ya
you all busy fighting each other also [lah]
[kan]
ya [sia] all those all those [ah] grab drivers top up from <malay>semua</malay> they like bloody salty [lah] [sia]
damn
that's
one sixty that you could have spent on something else
ya
all this <malay>ni semua nak tak nak</malay> [jer]
<malay>abeh dah malas nak buat apa</malay>
[oh] speaking of fuel the that
venezuelan ship no one going to save the thing
ya
no
ya
crude oil okay [ah] it should be fine but the problem is if it
if it sinks
[kan] I mean already is sinking
that's what I'm saying is like because the area around that ship is going to be contaminated as fuck
coast line
because coastline you can clean
that's fine
it's already dying I'm just expediting the process
just because of one person
[ah]
why
no
ya
basically
that's also true
[oh] obama <malay>punya tu</malay> toast invited obama to play among us
disguised toast
on fucking tweeter of all the places
really
that ya
in social media ya that's
ya that part I know but now I
I didn't expect that he's still active
a lot of the country don't agree with that [lah] but okay [ah] there are the backwater parts [ah]
the backwater parts the backwater part
the beginning of the congenial work at chomp chomp
it's just I think this happen only because
one of the <malay>siapa</malay> [eh]
crap I forgot I don't know her name she was playing among us
no the
A O C
A O C
nah
yup
week
[sial] [ah]
(uh huh)
it's basic human nature [lah] what you expect
no hell no
they will donate what they can just so they don't have taxes
ya per year mind you mind you [eh]
per year for a bloody tax
and that's
correct
right yup
<malay>banyak kau punya</malay> millions
no the thing is new world
and if people still believe in my legs
no hasn't been proven or there hasn't been
ya
ya [lah]
okay
(uh huh)
okay
!wow!
he couldn't take the delegation or interrogation other questions [ah]
differently
ya
ya I mean
it is it is what it is [ah] it's his style
either way it [eh] no I mean he's no he's trying to imitate china basically
we don't they do obviously the country is like that because it's already like that
what I've said is correct
then you just have to believe [eh]
we might as well be
#kim jong un#
[oh] my god I don't know [ah] [sia]
it was but is a guy he say I love the bible bible
ya
ya obviously
you would have a favourite somewhere
<malay>nak buat</malay> [sia]
and that that is trump in a nutshell [lah] [eh]
okay
how do you think are chomp is affecting economy
who is making economy great my business is booming again he's asking like what what what business are you in your what are you doing [oh] I do (uh) money money money lagging
[oh] !wow!
correct
yup
I don't think public transport is affected
ridership
ridership but then it still doesn't affect the whole
thing as a general and Grab drivers yes
because
obviously the company will care [ah]
ya
obviously not
ya but the thing is to grab drivers will hit the hardest especially the period
that [one] terrible [siol] like
only essential workers [what]
me [ah]
then like yours truly [ah]
work essential service not really essential
ya
not all
Grab drivers they only had their subsidy through their
[ah] rental <malay>punya tu</malay>
they got
it's not even that much [sia]
taxi yes Grab no Grab their rental was it was what they cut it down by thirty percent forty percent something like that but they still had to pay whereas taxis
it was free like [sial] [ah] they can [sial] [ah] that's why you see a lot
of taxis during the period just waiting doing nothing
that's the thing they can they can afford to do that because they don't have to pay rent and they just have to pay fuel
but then they don't have to drive around
because like why should I drive around when I need to pay for the fuel later so I just wait there
where as the Grab drivers they still had to pay like what fifty bucks from the right from the amount that I was talking with them like the rental they had to pay fifty every day still but then during period [sial] [ah] how to earn fifty [sia]
okay [ah] not not everyone can [ah] but that's why that's why during I had the same driver a week straight [sia]
he live somewhere [ah] there like nine hundred plus there I think
then everytime I book [eh] same guy tomorrow [eh] same guy
but <malay>padehal</malay> he just like on the app <malay>lepak kat rumah</malay> then <malay>tunggu ada</malay> call [jer] the [eh] bro I on the way [eh]
then like [ah] sorry [ah] bro <malay>ada benda boleh tunggu</malay> ten minutes <malay>tak</malay>
and like okay [ah] ten minutes only [what] not like I going anywhere I just take like for Grab
I don't I'm not really that
picky or like in a rush kind of thing cause you know I I go out early then I don't <malay>sampai kerja</malay> like on time on time I always <malay>sampai kerja</malay> with a lot of time still like half an hour before
that kind of shit [lah] so like I don't really care will have to wait extra just for the Grab to <malay>sampai</malay>
no it's like I'm there I'm just waiting you pick me up go <malay>dah sampai kerja buat kerja</malay> but then it's like ya
like unless on that day I overslept or something
then like shit I need to go now I need to go I need to <malay>sampai</malay> like right now
rare [ah] but then only then I will cancel
but then other than that no [ah]
if not <malay>nak kena</malay> <malay>tunggu lama</malay> [siol] or the the best the best that I got (uh) book
the <malay>punya</malay> say ten minutes
it was at #boon lay#
[ah] around that area <malay>tunggu tunggu tunggu tak sampai sampai</malay> the car not even moving
don't know call call message
everything no reply
[siol] then I like what the fuck [sial] wait here half an hour already [siol] then the thing still say ten minutes the fuck you doing [sia] cancel
no [ah]
it's justified
anyways okay you you can cancel within five minutes
after five minutes then you cancel got charge right but then like half an hour already [sia]
[kan]
then like <malay>gi mampos</malay> [ah]
just cancel get a new [one]
but then the thing is you don't
you you you don't directly
(uh)
okay [lah] ya there's there's the more apt way to say it [lah]
<malay>asal</malay> [kan] <malay>makanan sampai boleh makan dah cukup</malay> that kind of thing
like no see that's the thing there's a lot of patient customers out there like <malay>kalau kau ajak</malay> fight <malay>dah dua jam</malay> then <malay>tu lain cerita</malay> [ah] or the worse [one] is
you collect the food already
you collect the food already <malay>dah sampai</malay> right
then you put delivered
then <malay>takde</malay> the food not there
#sot# [sia] <malay>tu</malay>
like you wait already you wait and wait and wait
okay <malay>makanan dah sampai</malay> the thing says okay delivered <malay>buka pintu</malay>
<malay>mana makanan dia</malay>
then like [eh] [sial] [ah] <malay>kena</malay> scam
[oh] ya ya ya ya
then <malay>terus dia keluar</malay> [kan] pizza <malay>makan</malay>
<malay>tu memang ajak</malay> fight
ya
or those people in I mean the disabled people
(hmm)
[ah]
but in singapore majority of buildings have lift [what]
like rare you find
that that [one] is dorms
[eh] well
service industry [lah] [eh]
the woes of it
you get you get that kind of shit [ah] you get that kind of shit [ah]
you is body disease
better than the previous workplace then start
everyone was you know up in arms about it
bloody supermarket getting cleared out and shit
is like you know what like
okay [ah] <malay>suka hati korang</malay> [ah] [ah] you want to stock up I don't know how many
months of rations it's not even officially yet that kind of shit then it's like
okay [ah] <malay>suka hati</malay> [ah]
and usually the thing is
there's a pro and con to it [ah]
usually by then on the shelves will be cleared and they'll be restocking
but then if you come too early
got nothing for you
but then you have to come just the right time that they are restocking the stuff then ya
cause <malay>malam</malay> is when all the supplies <malay>masuk</malay> [pe]
then ya all the vendors <malay>datang</malay> then they take stock and all that nonsense usually it's like right now currently [ah] is like
the supermarket if it's a twenty four seven supermarket they'll be like one or two staff only at night [ah]
cause
<malay>takde orang</malay>
(mm)
[ah]
okay [lah] I mean
the one that I went to was somewhat like this
[ah] #gek poh# <malay>punya</malay> prime small-ish [ah] so like [ah] there's not
there's only one entrance and one exit [lah] so like you can't really run away
and then you have to like you does use your
safe entry shit go in then after that buy whatever you want to buy
then <malay>takde</malay> cashier
the cashier doing restocking
then like
but lucky got bell [ah] got the service bell so like you know if you want to like do whatever shopping that you need already then after that you ring the service bell
then the person will come

that got one customer order until like fifteen cartons
of mineral water
mind you [eh] not the six hundred no
one point five litre
I tell you which driver <malay>tak mengamok</malay> if they get that kind of thing
we have our fair share of idiots
everywhere else in the world I mean our percentage is not that much compared but there is still so like you know one person say like this everyone say like this then becomes hive mind you especially know the older generations
because they have their own group
clique thing so like one person say something everyone will believe it you know that kind of shit
why
why
but ya
[ah]
like okay [ah] if
if you go out of your way
to try to verify it then I would understand [ah] but then like you know
you post in the thing then after that you believe like [eh] !siala!
this thing [ah] like that like that like that
then like
<malay>bodoh</malay> [ah] it's just <malay>bodoh</malay>
free masks don't know how many times already they updrage the mask some more
the first [one] was too tight ya that [one] that [one] was too tight but okay [ah] the rest all fine so okay [ah] <malay>apa-apa</malay> [ah]
