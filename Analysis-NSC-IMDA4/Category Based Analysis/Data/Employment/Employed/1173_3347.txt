today my treat
yup very convenient and easy
okay come next one I think I asked the second question already right superpower
so yup so that's my question so how about yours what you want to ask
no I I ask what I ask you superpower I ask (err) wish
you ask me what (err) what I do that one and
the I forgot what's the other one
I talk so much until <malay>semua dah lupa</malay>
I also I also short term memory
[ah]
what was I studying [ah] I was studying (err) radiation therapy so (err) radiation therapy <malay>tu kita</malay> treat (err) cancer patients [lah]
so ya my my batch [eh] <malay>kita cuma ada</malay> you guess how many how many people
[oh] very close very close so per year (err) radiation therapy is the smallest community in singapore ever so <malay>kita ambil dalam lima belas orang sahaja</malay>
ya it's the smallest (err) smallest more specialised (err) what you call that
(err) programme in singapore [lah] so <malay>cuma</malay>
I I don't know if I I don't know but it's very specialized all I can say it's so specialized and there's only a handful of people doing it [lah] it's such a small community
(um) but the best part is ya I'm not I am not practising it [lah]
I don't want to practise it yup
I'm not practising as in you see now I'm doing so or being instead of doing radiation therapy
ya
so I mean because it's too mechanical like (um) I deal more with (uh) like all the machine machine instead of people
cause my kind of person is <malay>nak</malay> (uh) ya <malay>suka berbual dengan orang</malay> like make that connection feel like (err)
feel like I'm the I'm the cure for them
instead
in in a way <malay>boleh katakan</malay> (err) somewhat <malay>macam</malay> they they they they feel (err)
<malay>macam berharga</malay> [lah] cause (uh) I'm the one which help them instead of like this machine blah blah blah blah because if this radiation therapy just a bit you just shift shift shift the patient here there then after that
(err) <malay>terus</malay> treat <malay>kita cuma berbual sedikit</malay> [jer] <malay>setakat</malay> (uh) ya hi (err) sir ma'am how are you [oh] (err) any side effect you trying to stand are you okay [oh] ya ya how's the pain feeling okay K come sit down sit down
here we're going to start the treatment then move here move there perform blah blah blah blah then it's just like that then okay bye take care remember just like that
I I want ya I I want a heap if can I want to hear people's problem then <malay>macam tolong dia orang</malay> [lah]
in a in a way (err) the field [lah] I want to be is actually like (err) psychology kind become a psychiatrist ya but I heard
you will have to go (err) what you call that (err) undergo
undergo clinical hours yourself that means you have to go your own counselling sessions that means you have to be counselled for three hundred hours
something like that [lah] and ya you're not only you have to study but you have to clock in this clinical hours and you have to pay for them yourself
ya you have to pay so yes three
yes correct so three hundred of the hours you have to not only pay the school fees you have to come up with your own money to pay counsellors before you work as one
(uh huh) so that's what deterred me from what I wanna do [lah] unless I can print money right then I mean like
that's that's wasted on it let's just study
yup exactly money's a big freaking issue
(err) ya talking about it like very depressing already
like money [lah] like I I don't know now at this age I mean I feel like money never enough already sadly
