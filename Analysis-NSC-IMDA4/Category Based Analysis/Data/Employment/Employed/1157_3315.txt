I was looking through our the booking right
then <malay>aku</malay> realise
<malay>mahal</malay> [sia] it's like seven hundred dollars for the one that we are going ya is because it's the <malay>apa</malay> last week of the year [what]
[kan] then <malay>aku tak tahu macam mana</malay> like we need to have more options I guess
ya okay
but unless we go for the <malay>apa</malay> [ah] smaller rooms [ah]
because the one that I found was
that one <malay>untuk yang</malay> the suite room so <malay>aku rasa macam besar sangat</malay> I mean we don't really need a that big of a room right no but I think can go for the smaller rooms
the same place because
okay (err)
<malay>aku rasa boleh</malay> [ah] but I think it's about <malay>dalam empat ratus gitu</malay>
<malay>aku rasa</malay> [ah]
ya but what's your budget
hundred plus [ah] below two hundred should be okay right
ya I think <malay>aku rasa</malay> for now <malay>empat orang</malay> but
ya I think only four [lah] right
unless dylan joining I'm not sure
ya so (err)
but I'm checking my friend like cause my friend got the (uh) call (um) membership
so he got discount [lah]
ya
that one is sofitel is at #tanjong pagar#
very near [what] the hotel I mean I mean you can go I mean it's around there's a lot of cafes there also [what]
ya
ya I think it's all nearby there [lah]
ya technically I don't know also what to do
ya but we need to decide soon [lor]
yup
the price confirm <malay>makin mahal</malay>
it's gonna keep on surging until like new year I guess
ya [lor]
ya [oh] ya my company just say like they might not close for the week so I might have to take leave ya
but then I think I'll take the whole week [lah] I see how [lor] technically I got no leave
zero
again okay last year ya [oh] ya last year we had the what
botanic gardens theme [ah] the boy <malay>bunga</malay> theme
ya no but whenever #tanjong pagar# theme
don't know
I don't know [lah] maybe theme
[oh] ya are we doing gift exchange also
we haven't plan this yet
[oh] ya <malay>dia belum</malay> decide right
ya
[oh] really [ah]
from which (err) supermarket
prime is hard to find you know there's only like <malay>berapa</malay> [jer] <malay>dalam</malay> singapore <malay>ni</malay> [tau] <malay>nak cari</malay>
ya
#sheng siong# #sheng siong# also hard [sia]
I mean you see my area around down here there's no #sheng siong# the nearest is #bukit panjang# mall
giant [lah] since we just with brandon
[eh] last year we did giant
!aiya!
[eh] ya ya
so what
ya I remember the cause I think got more things to buy
<malay>kipas</malay> [oh] it's at terrence's house now his house got two fans you know <malay>sebelah-sebelah</malay> [leh] like one black one white I don't know why if you want both right the whole dining table that can fly away like that it's so strong
<malay>bodoh</malay>
ya <malay>bodoh</malay> so big [sia]
ya so what is just the four of us [ah] #xing jing# [oh] no with the others right because we doing dinner <malay>dengan yang lain-lain</malay> [kan] <malay>malam</malay> so
(mm)
who's the free one [ah]
can you plan
please
<malay>kau</malay> plan [lah] then <malay>kau bilang kita</malay> then we will just decide I mean we will just a vote
you have to be codes
ya they <malay>bodoh</malay>
this is not chinese new year
this is christmas so <malay>tak payah</malay> #lohei#
dinner
I think dinenr can go all out [lah] I guess not all out as in <malay>macam terus</malay>
<malay>apa sakan</malay> [ah] but more like a
but now buffet very irritating [ah]
no there is there is buffet but you cannot like it's not serve [lah] I mean like it's not open and you have to order from them so it's like a la carte kind so you keep on ordering from them then the <malay>makanan</malay> will <malay>dia ada</malay> server will send to you yes I know right ya so I think it's not a good time for buffet
ya
but buffet town though
you know there's the the one that just got halal buffet town ya cause they got very nice salmon head like grilled salmon head
ya it is
(mm)
he <malay>kena</malay> bullied
what what do you mean location <malay>kena</malay> change you mean the buffet town run away or what
is it I there's only one buffet town I think it's at raffles city
I know
[oh] ya buffet town got not vegetarian option though maybe have I don't know
cannot be go buffet you want to eat salad right
ya
[oh] ya but they haven't confirm their attendance also
for the dinner <malay>dia orang boleh</malay> [eh]
okay
(um) terrence I haven't check with him yet <malay>tapi aku rasa</malay> maybe <malay>dia tak boleh</malay> because that week he's going back to school already
[oh] ya true also
I mean if we're not going to into phase three anytime soon I think
did you see the news yesterday
they say like because of the
trace together like the
there's only fifty percent right now like people using it and the token collected and they need to be at least <malay>macam tujuh puluh</malay> percent <malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> go to phase three [lah] so
ya so it looks like not going to phase three anytime soon
yes
and then we cannot book separate table also cause technically we are not allowed to
no they don't allow but because of that [lah] they're afraid intermingling so actually by right you cannot book
more than five even though your request for separate tables only unless you are a family members [lah] <malay>yang tinggal dalam serumah</malay> right
ya
different timing
ya
can
okay also like like terrence friend have a christmas <malay>punya</malay> dinner [kan]
so what they did was because they I think got there's fifteen of us
so they separate into three different sessions
so got the lunch session teatime session and dinner session
precisely [lah] I mean you cannot meet [lah] but
so <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> like
ya
ya so I don't know whether we are still going on with the dinner or not
[oh] ya just five of us [lah]
without partners [lor]
(mm)
that time you did right like the four five of us
last meet up it's just five of us [what]
korean ya that [ah]
#farin# birthday
[oh]
[oh] yes
ya I mean just let them let them tell their partners [lor] that
#bo# #pian# [lah] [kan] <malay>macam tak boleh apa</malay>
ya
ya so I think the dinner one is settled
I mean technically it's not even a <malay>macam</malay> public holiday on that day right
so they don't have to spend it with their partners anyway
twenty nine right you say or twenty eight I mean it's the night of the
staycay right
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya okay
I think he never go there before so you should be safe <malay>dia tak ada</malay> benchmark <malay>untuk tempat tu</malay>
ya
(um)
at west he can come
but he only come at night after work [lah]
then the next morning he will <malay>aku rasa</malay> go to the work straight
ya
(mm)
ya [lor]
so the tuesday morning <malay>aku rasa</malay> he has to go back to work [lor]
monday right
is it really
ya
[oh]
okay I thought it's monday and tuesday
you
!hais!
okay [lor] we shall see how then we need to dig up more
ya
cause I remember I ask my friend for monday tuesday <malay>punya</malay> time slot I mean (err) rates ya
then he say it's like seven hundred [oh] my god like the one the I bought was only four hundred [sia]
ya because it's technically already the end of the year already a lot of people doing staycation so
you know right technically there's nowhere to travel also everything is expensive here
<malay>masih</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay> taiwan
you are in a cold room
!whoa! but luckily I went taiwan [sia] just before lockdown
ya
(err) not as good as that one we we went that time
ya it was that one I go on march it was <malay>macam sejuk</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> just like aircon kind yes
on some days it was quite hot actually but some days it was quite nice then ya
but that was a stressful trip
!hais!
!hais! ya
ya
[eh] but I heard the vaccine are coming in right so I think
there should be the light already like at the end of the tunnel
(um) ya
but you know the that time the who say [ah] which minister
the he say <malay>macam apa</malay> like
he's not going they are not going to <malay>macam</malay> vaccinate everybody <malay>kat</malay> singapore
like it's only like selective like they're not going to do a mass vaccination
ya
<malay>tak tahu</malay> save <malay>duit agaknya</malay>
ya
so I think we have to queue to get vaccinated kind
probably [lah] elderly maybe the front liners
ya
it's probably like those flu vaccine vaccinations [lah] wait those are compulsory right
ya maybe they make it compulsory but not so soon
I don't know
but until then I don't think we can travel [lah]
want to give up
ya because I think singapore is the safest now one of the safest ya
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
was there [lah] [oh] my god
(mm)
<malay>apa</malay> purpose [kan] I mean at home technically don't wear mask also
so <malay>kalau anak dia dapat mak dia dapat</malay> they can just spread to each other [lah]
(err) they have another issue to tackle there [oh] my god
(mm)
are you talking about succulent
[oh] cactus cactus <malay>yang kecil-kecil gitu</malay> [eh] then
[oh]
<malay>dua</malay> cactus
the normal one cactus
no the normal cactus <malay>yang besar dia ada</malay> thorns then <malay>macam bulat-bulat gitu</malay> and <malay>dia punya</malay> shape
straight then <malay>bulat-bulat</malay> [eh] right ya isn't it a normal desert cactus
succulents are technically not from a desert I think
that's okay welcome to the plant world
<malay>kau siak</malay> [ah] !hey! <malay>mahal pokok tu</malay>
(mm)
[oh] I don't think that you can probably survive in our climate though
as in real life okay I see
what [sia] cardboard
[oh] what
<malay>kau tanam pokok</malay> durian [jer] [lah]
I mean even though you don't eat durian but
ya
!hais! anyway I have an assignment on an essay [lah] so I need just (err) your your point of view [lah] I guess
(mm) it's about (um)
locked down like
like they say like they are more problems than benefits when it come to lockdown like
it affects a lot of thing
like so I don't know what do you think
kind
I mean
the experts say [lah] the lockdown causes more <malay>macam apa</malay> problems than benefits ya
why
(mm)
ya
true [leh] ya ya
ya but
no no it's usually quite sudden kind a week before at least I guess
(mm)
ya
(mm)
good [what] lockdown good [what] I was enjoying the period
(mm)
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
so you feel that there's more societal problems [lah] rather than businesses businesses still okay right
thirty to
[oh]
ya
(mm)
okay but I think there's a benefit to that you know because like these forces are but like enterprises this small enterprise right
they go digital like because like the government has been like I feel [lah] like always been pushing
all these to go digitalisation but nobody's doing anything like but I think this lockdown really pushes everyone to just straightaway go and
like to and what embrace digitalisation [lah] so I think it's quite good in a way like
ya
ya she can straightaway (err)
<malay>macam dulu dia tak pakai</malay> grab but <malay>sekali</malay> now [oh] I need to have a grab account like you know so it
it pushes them to do it [lah] rather than <malay>kau tahu macam kalau tak ada</malay> COVID like everybody is still
<malay>macam</malay> oodle the oodle eats like that ya it came out about during also got famous because of this so
okay [lah] <malay>aku rasa</malay>
ya [lah] #alhamdulillah# I need the money so what's the problem
ya but but they are given trainings you know and they were even even like given grants and money <malay>untuk</malay>
to avoid this (err) to convert their platform store into online platform [lah] so
<malay>aku rasa</malay> okay [lah]
(mm)
true I mean you will lose your human touches also [lah] right I guess ya but also the thing like this lockdown like
a lot of people just start their own business like a lot of now like because of a lockdown so I think
<malay>bagus</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam macam semua orang jual apa jual apa</malay> what's that famous thing they make during lockdown
everybody become a chef <malay>kat rumah</malay> [kan] <malay>semua buat</malay> #dalgona# coffee <malay>macam kau</malay>
okay ya I think so then like societal I think also got benefits like
(err)
I think it brings families together
kind
<malay>macam</malay>
you will just stuck at home with your family [lah] you got no choice but just to interact <malay>dengan dia orang</malay> like
that's all [lah] like
so
ya
I know
but although yes I agree that it can be quite a challenge because like <malay>kalau kau baca</malay> that time the news they say like domestic abuse cases on is on the rise was on the rise because
not every family can get along [lah] hundred percent get along so
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya
(mm)
all the one she studied at the corridor that one right
ya probably
ya I can imagine like those like
staying in a rental apartment with like nine or ten family members in one !wah! then
ya
right ya
(mm)
ya obviously
ya
(mm)
true
(mm)
but I think right another benefit right is definitely their environment like have you seen like you go out during it's like a jungle out there
I mean it's such a good time you know for everyone to heal for the world to heal like
ya
you think your floor will the grass will be three second on the floor already
ya you know what I mean
ya definitely bro
they are better [lah] because you know carbon footprints were reduced [lah] I mean
not a lot of cars were out there
that the biggest benefit [lah] of the lockdown it reduces like reduces the
cases like at the very enormous straight [lah] like just
ya
ya
ya
okay [lah] at least they are well taken care of I hope coming from what we see on the news I think they are quite well taken of just that I think
the problem lies because they are being locked for too long so it cause a lot of emotional and emotional distress [lah] I would say
ya so
ya
ya you can't visit [leh]
ya I mean what can you do also right
ya
(mm)
ya
then <malay>aku rasa</malay> like I think they <malay>dia orang tak</malay> concentrate more much on the emotional part of a lockdown like they just implement without thinking of
maybe they did [lah] like factor in this issue
but they just don't know how to tell singaporeans how to manage their emotions I mean
but it increases like distressed like emotional distress and see like people are going crazy you know
probably probably that one is like not a priority I guess I don't know
I mean during the even like <malay>dia punya apa</malay>
not counsellors [lah] what what is it calling
<malay>orang yang</malay>
counsellors is it not counsellors
ya it's not even consider essential at that point like they can't even work ya they have to work from home and go
ya so
so it's not even essential at that point so ya
so they don't really care about that part <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> but
ya
(mm)
I know right I want a bit longer
ya I mean this is probably the once in our lifetime we have this I mean hopefully yes [lah] but then not expecting more
ya ya ya
I mean in this lifetime you can say that we have a point alive and everything just reset like the whole world reset ya
during our time
ya probably the start of a new civilization
ya [eh] can you think for me anymore problems or not for lockdown I need to write my essay
societal business and emotion is under society [lah] I guess
wildlife or nature sorry yes
you just any problem right
I think there's nothing to argue about it I think when you the problem can be like you walk in a grass then touch touch your leg
mosquito because of overgrown right all these then they bleed mosquito remember the this case [lah] on the rise during
ya but because you don't trim this grass then all this leaves you never clear it except all these leaves and
can collect water [one]
no there is there is so tiny dot on the water you never dry out right
can breed mosquito [one]
it's true okay [lah] but that's not really a problem I guess
it just go without the track [what] [sia] <malay>bodoh</malay>
ya but I think the biggest benefit now is in china the this
all the the the animal trade the exotic animal all this
they have to really
the businesses have to shut down [lah]
like before this there was there wasn't any like regulation on exotic animals in china
but at least it's one step ahead I feel [lah] at least now there is a rule before there's really no rule at all
so whether they enforce it or not ya
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] confirm <malay>ada</malay> [lah]
ya
you know but the article say like twenty thousand farms were forced to close and shut down I think that's a good start like twenty thousand farms like a lot [leh]
is it
aren't we not at the top
[oh] we're not the predator
I don't know
the animal kindom we are probably one of the lowest [lah]
but we have brains though they got no brain I mean they have brains but they are not intellect
ya I mean they they can do always fight for survival defining this thing in nature
ya
ya okay
no okay then I think it'll be issue also imagine like this twenty thousand farm closed down already these animals where do they go you know like
they're gonna released back into the wild it's gonna cause like a major disrupt to the ecosystem then <malay>macam</malay> suddenly <malay>kau dalam hutan tu kau</malay> introduce <malay>monyet kau</malay> introduce pangolin <malay>kau</malay> introduce lemur <malay>pelanduk</malay> I don't know what or it released dolphin into the forest you know
ya so what's gonna happen to this animal
<malay>pergi mana balik rumah kau</malay>
ya <malay>ni bukan</malay> library [tau] <malay>kau taruh lepas tu kau taruh balik kat tempat asal kau ambil</malay> [tau]
it's that not easy you know
that they can't give the animals like tickets to go home on themselves
they probably gonna like
I don't know
or maybe they do a clearance sale I don't know
everything must go right I mean I don't know like
there's also the vail is not releasing back to the wild I guess I mean it you can visit back to the wild but
you have to know where to put it back to [lah] but it's not possible [lah] per se
[oh] my god
[oh] that one that they kill all the animal [ah] but cause the one all is affected infected with the coronavirus [what] ya yes yes
they carry it on their body
so it's spread through the minks
so they have to kill or <malay>macam</malay> that one [lah] like what chicken flu like that [eh] bird flu chicken flu
they have to kill all the the chickens [mah]
I think until now nobody knows where it's from right
ya
<malay>sekali</malay> coronavirus from plants [leh]
yes
<malay>apa apa merepek kau</malay>
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya inside the middle [ah]
(uh huh)
ya ya ya isn't that the cheese (err) [ah] swiss cheese plant
stop it [lah]
what's your other plant how's your other monstera doing your current monstera
but you at the at the latch right
what's the per buying put it outside
put back inside
five times [leh]
what is a prayer plant
(mm)
ya
(mm)
but monstera is an indoor plant [what] right
it's just need a little like
sun
I thought you need the evening sun or something
(mm)
ya
ya
technically they are bushes [lah] weeds
ya so you have been blocked by the trees right they are being shaded right
ya
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
not really [leh]
ya
no but first life I think very short always wilt [leh]
<malay>kau masih</malay> [tau]
but you know I was talking to one of terrence friend he study plants he's like a farmer [lah] but he's not farmer but
he said actually all these plants right
when they say like it's good for your
(err) the air the in the room all these I actually just flexible if that kind like because they don't emit enough to actually cause a a difference like unless you have like ten hundred like a hundred monstera in your room kind then yes you can feel so actually one of this talk [leh] like it doesn't make a difference actually
ya so you just make yourself feel better
good job ya that's fake by the way
cause the sun ever come in so we come back and rear plants
but need a bit of sun also [what] light can [ah]
ya
mother in laws tongue
ya I know
<malay>dah mati ke</malay>
can [ah]
ya probably can [lah] I don't know
I don't know it just grows short [lah] from small to big [lah] I guess shoots ya
!hais!
I only need to buy one plant <malay>untuk taruh dalam</malay> office <malay>aku</malay>
no [oh] my god that one
<malay>mati kesian benda tu</malay>
but actually <malay>mati</malay> a very terrible death to do
ya [sia] <malay>kau teruk</malay> [sia]
then we got scraping <malay>benda tu</malay>
no [meh]
I thought you called spraypaint to do or something
yup
[ah]
(mm)
the humidity very dense right very cold
you're not the plant you don't what it's feeling should we die during night you know like screaming in pain for like the next eight hours
but know all you think about is aesthetics you don't care about the plants feelings
I think the safest plants are those you see in the office
offices that have plants right is safe because it's been tested to survive in office (uh) condition which there's aircon and not enough sunlight kind
!aiya! the typical <malay>kau tahu jemputan selalu dapat pokok tu dia orang taruh kat pasu</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> coconut tree but it's not
what is it called [eh] <malay>yang</malay>
it's not coconut tree <malay>yang pokok-pokok yang</malay>
fern <malay>gitu</malay> is it look like a fern
!aiya! very the
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] serious
I think you know if you see but don't know what plant is discovered but it's a very common plant
ya something like that
ya usually events that kind of <malay>pokok</malay> [lah] you know like those
standard <malay>pokok</malay> I don't know
it's the typical <malay>pokok</malay> at events you know
!aiya! you don't know [one] [lah]
why
cause iron can scoop you can put your steak on it
(mm) [oh] my god
(mm)
yes that's one thing <malay>pokok pisang</malay>
!hais!
(mm)
spray is it then
(mm)
[ah]
ya ya of course you can't pour on the leaf though
(mm)
ya
okay technically it's commercial so they have to make it last for very long the water I guess
no as long as you do drainage right it's okay ya because in awhile also [what] if rain you can't stop the rain right ya most of the time it's drainage so you cannot cover the base like what you did that time go plastic wrap at the tulle scotch tape
(mm)
no depend not off plus you can do that or not
I guess I mean you can go out plant
(mm) ya
ya you can't water you everyday if not will die [sia]
(hmm)
[oh] my god it's so expensive though
it's like I don't know the price
ya you better up your green fingers first
enough [lah] too much plants [ah] mosquitoes moving around
you got a lot of mosquito then a lot of ants all those and insects start coming in
because you talk the wildlife standard plant standard issue plant [eh]
[oh] no
!aiya! you don't know [one] [lah]
