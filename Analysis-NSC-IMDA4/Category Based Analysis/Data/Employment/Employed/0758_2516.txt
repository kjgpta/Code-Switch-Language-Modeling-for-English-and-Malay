okay so is actually (um) in which year [eh] you <malay>nak</malay> get married [eh
[oh] so this one is (um) actually like or you tend to move to your home first right after your wedding [kan
tru
(um) but again I thin
(err) you also have to think this if you are staying like in one year's time then you need to find a a <malay>bilik</malay> or a room <malay>yang</malay> like you actually both are more comfortable to stay with [lah] correct or no
ya [lah] correct [lah] <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> I think you you both have to think what's the budget [lah] so budget actually <malay>berapa</malay> is it a combined wedding <malay>ke</malay
(mm) okay okay [lah] then I think <malay>kita</malay> we have to take a look part by part [lah] [kan] like for example K now a wedding will come first before the house right so and (um) so basically is between like (err) in six months time can you get the new flat is that correc
ya that one agree but I think give you like certain allowance right like a number of you have to complete the basic renovation is that correc
[oh] ya [lah] that one I think normal [lah] since my time many years ago also same also [lah] the thing ya so I think (uh) ya your dad perspective or opinion I thin
quite correct it's just that I think at least if active for [lor] at least the basic must be there like for example flooring and then like painting but I think for every house the most important thing is the flooring and the kitchen cabinet at least [lah
[oh] because I think you have to that is because that's the one I think make most no
ya I think we w
if the business already there then okay there's a plus point so I think at least the renovation will be on the kitchen so if you ask me the kitchen you need [kan] <malay>macam</malay> lik
do the edit the the first bottom and then the top right you need to do first that will be cheape
that's one suggestio
ya I think that will be cheape
yes it i
for the wedding righ
(mm) I think I think in this case [ah] I think your situation is very similar like mine so I think you have to prioritise things like [ah
which one you want to cut down [ah] on the on on itself like it's like flat versus wedding so if let's say (uh) if you ask me then of course I will choose the flat [lah] because apparently like <malay>macam</malay> flat <malay>kita nak tinggal sepanjang hayat</malay> !chey! <malay>sepanjang hayat</malay> [ah
okay so basically like for wedding like ya is once in a life time bu
like I say (uh) the the most important thing is the the the <malay>nikah</malay> itself only so other the miscellaneous take photos okay that's another to me i
more fundamental [lah] but in terms of guest if let's say the other party agreed maybe cut down to two hundred fifty eve
let's say a super ya #gemod# [lah] #gemod# is like very stingy like that so basically like that we just lik
invite two fifty then maybe like you know (uh) his side [ah
hundred fifty ya [seh] hundred so that super budget kind of thing ya it can be don
like like for example I thin
ya like I say like both have to compromise [lah] it's lik
(um) family support have to come in so that's why that day you all <malay>kena macam</malay> plan budget like how much like per per side can contribute with their family already inside the picture [lah] that [one] have to be very like (um
(um) very like (uh) transparent but in the event if let's say both side <malay>macam</malay> let's say for example your parents either deal with their own ideology or plan of their wedding the
you <malay>ada</malay> your own plan of your (uh) I mean his side <malay>ada dia punya</malay> own plan of ideology then I think the only thing you have to <malay>fikir</malay> or think about i
like okay in that case we do separate [lah] that is another alternative [ah] other alternative then your side then [ah] then he has to like make a figurative speech or what figurative speech [oh] !wah! like super english like tha
K so basically like you he has to tell frankly to his side like yo
parents like okay maybe I can only afford to pay for how many guest then the rest you can absorb <malay>tak</malay> so that is another another way [lah] [kan] <malay>macam kita nak</malay> (um) try to put everything in hand [lah
so wedding time at least your side <malay>macam</malay> okay then for your side (uh) you and your family then like for use okay I can only pay for hundred guests then if your father say okay another hundred guests I can top up your father say like that then is if sometime
you may say that having a separate cost more but you will depend on the individual side of budget [eh] sometimes <malay>kita kena fikir</malay> that in terms o
the pros are I know now the trend is all combined but provided if let's say all agreed and transparent on board the costings and expenditur
this is something sensitive in even in our culture in <malay>kita punya (err) <malay>orang melayu kita macam</malay> sensitive [ah] about <malay>duit ni</malay> so I think you all have t
considered in the air because like right now both families <malay>belum</malay> sit down and really get to know each other you know even like for me and my brothe
about <malay>duit pun kita adik-beradik masih</malay> sensitive <malay>tak boleh macam</malay> [eh] just <malay>bang aku mau pinjam duit kau</malay> [lah] <malay>satu ribu macam suka suka</malay> [jer] <malay>nak minta [kan] abang</malay> you know I have to be like more tactful to u
<malay>kak</malay> are you okay if I pay down then I will I will lay down what I can afford then in at least is like more clear cut <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay
like in this case <malay>lagi</malay> the other party <malay>yang</malay> your parents <malay>belum kenal</malay> [kan] and then the breedlove assumption the so I thin
(uh) bottom line you both must tel
(err) got two choice if want to combine the
then (err) you and #hairin# you he tell his family how much he can afford you tell how much you can affor
then how much your both parents can fork out together so if let's say you [dah] sample among all again okay [lah] <malay>kita</malay> work combine then okay celebrate <malay>buat</malay> combine <malay>tapi</malay> if let's say [oh
[ah] you know [lah] I still want my one thousand guest let's say #hairin# <malay>punya</malay> side the
your mother say okay <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] based on your budget <malay>kita</malay> invite <malay>saudara mara dekat</malay> [jer] one hundred okay then you do separately because let's say his mother say okay then I will pay for tha
extra guest whereas for his (uh) no need then you [leh] you just you just invite [lah] whoever that is important between your lis
because there are two factors you need to think first (um) <malay>kita tak nak mengecewakan hati siapa siapa pihak</malay> because you all just become a new family member secon
(err) then is like you al
like want to have a fresh new beginning with a very good fit startup [lah] <malay>tak nak macam semua gaduh gaduh</malay> then after this the next time <malay>dia pergi rumah</malay
you know last time you are fortunate you actually know that you gonna have six months down the road after the wedding that you have a flat you know how my time I got my flat is so like you know like how to say [ah
like <malay>macam</malay> (err
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> waterfall at that I find it or even tsunami so offence already like I will just like get (err
think that time really I think I could engage in january finall
july I got a fla
and then july got a flat [ah] my <malay>kita punya</malay> timeline two years <malay>tu nak engage</malay
you know then <malay>tak tahu macam mana tahu</malay> bought flat then because [ah] because <malay>atuk</malay> said better
<malay>cepat cepat nikah dapat rumah sendiri</malay> then after that we are like [ha
then like that everything all my plan with your uncle <malay>semua macam</malay> [dah] haywire all I received only fla
<malay>kita punya</malay> like dream wedding <malay>kita punya</malay> dream vacation <malay>semua macam</malay> [dah] flash toilet [jer] <malay>tu begitu</malay> [ah] so it's lik
then after that I think (um) at that tim
I I'm quite fortunate like I have support or family so like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] my father know that he will pay off my wedding expenses whereas for I will just focu
(um) <malay>makanan tapi</malay> [kan] shamefully I have to admit even I [dah] work that time [kan] I <malay>tak boleh</malay> afford [tau] because I just start my work the
and I'm about to save so like <malay>macam</malay> even like you know the bridal like you all have all these [ah] then I think I can only afford the photos <malay>begitu</malay> that's all with with my husband then I think my husband that time even <malay>hantaran nak</malay> exchange [ah
(um) I think quite I I would say I like <malay>macam</malay> drag it [lah] but I think about it because in the end like we don't really can afford even for exchange of <malay>hantaran</malay> I think in the en
we buy some things on our sid
then because the the story was that that we will promise that some sustain law said okay [lah] why not <malay>kita</malay> combine <malay>kita beli dorang dorang hadiah untuk</malay> exchange <malay>hantaran</malay
then suddenly when the time come the exchange is not there so it's lik
so I buy solely whatever I can afford that's all [lah] ya correc
I think if I were you I will actually create an excel spreadsheet the reason is because I I will actually (um) pros and cons if let's say I have I have this budget okay what I know if combine I I pick let's say shortlist two place on i
then okay shortlist already know what they have you don't have the push [ah] you no need to type [ah] you just put what are the key things that are there okay how many dishes [ah] food [ah] food dishe
(uh) the equipment that include all the (err) the <malay>kompang</malay> and everything I think some weddings some packages inclusive some are not so <malay>kita kena tengok macam mana</malay> [lah] [kan] so is lik
you will you will see like [ah] how much it is can I find the similarities you have anothe
(uh) tab that we're actually for separate cost then you see the cheapest of all including the decoration the ball hall everything like per head like how much then how many dishes there from there on okay let's say vehicle K you must think of [eh] (um
<malay>orang melayu kita ni</malay> actually (err) come with a lot of (err) <malay>gotong royong</malay> even though <malay>kita tak sekampung</malay> [lah] not inside you won't believe right so the thing i
relative will still to will be okay to like <malay>macam pinjamkan kereta</malay> you know so when if you no
(err) how to say #farah# see you just like okay [lah] whatever people (uh) rent you okay [lah] something like that so if let's say like your your your parents like know like <malay>macam</malay
(uh) certain relative got this car whatever they say [eh] I #chope# your car <malay>dulu</malay> for the coming wedding can or not just ask [lah
you know or maybe like <malay>dekat dekat</malay> wedding <malay>tu</malay> you ask becaus
(uh) <malay>dulu</malay> I in this case usually [lah] people will still be alright to loan for wedding car then you just lik
(uh) we're not that chinese must be like Mercedes-Benz or Jaguar [lah] [pe] [seh] joke [ah] I'm not racist [tau] but I'm talking about culturally we no need to be like so branded indicative kind of of stereotyping that kind of thing [lah] so it was just like <malay>kita</malay> like just focu
(uh) what we collect like okay let's say if car put there possible free you know okay is to make it compatibility the same as like you are in a in the same central place [lah] then after that (uh) if plus decoration you see how much is some I think per head come with decoration simple simple decoratio
(uh) then after that from there you see we which is much better so at least when it comes when they're both families sit dow
okay because you will have to target by maybe end of this yea
<malay>ataupun</malay> early january next year you and your partner must how much you all can fork out <malay>agak agak</malay> because by that time you [dah] start your full time job okay then he already has its sort of monthly <malay>berapa</malay> one month <malay>berapa dapat</malay> sav
so basically you can <malay>agak agak</malay> already estimated amount that you can reach between end of twenty next year is what twenty twenty one [ah
[ah] so then from there [oh] then you all like [oh] okay [lah] then can start working I know you your what you're getting married twenty twenty tw
[ah] so if let's say cannot fit maybe we aim january twenty twenty three that's the worst worst timeline [lah] so that even though you got five months (uh) to your new place but actually you will actuall
like you have the time to what we call you know already you have some surplus cash ready that for you to prepare the basi
okay let's say #khatib# (uh) when you move in or maybe you need to check first because we already have the basics right so you just make sure that you have like simple lightings for some places only or you can actually have th
like (uh) the cabinet or whatever because I believe (uh) you got to check that one [lah] renovation too so you get the minima
you can even ask (err) K what's the minimum renovation I should do within that timeline because what happens if I don't have the amount to have a full renovation you can ask them all these so that at leas
like I'm pretty sure you are not the only owner like this [lah] there's a lot of new couple that are buying flat also wha
so basically is like that [ah] so that is one area that you actually ca
can save on it [lah] that is one part of it ya so ya [lah] so I think you you you ca
take I mean seriously you wedding's already a big headache if you ask me seriously big headache ya then having a new home is another big headache so it's just that now it comes one one can take care [kan
my only thing is that okay if he's (uh) you all have to like let's say workout [lah] the thing [lah] workout the thing then from there on then you will se
how is it (uh) on i
[oh] I think (uh
this one take time [lah] but again (uh) I think #hairin# (uh) or or #hairin# [lah] <malay>siapa</malay> [lah] (uh) maybe is t
need to actually like you know find the time for it for to have this share with his parents especiall
because this part I think you really cannot butt in yet because (uh) you <malay>ini</malay> [kan] actually <malay>masih macam saudara baru dalam keluarga tu</malay
so <malay>memang</malay> [lah] <malay>nak kena macam jaga-jaga jugaa</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>yang mereka</malay> seems like okay okay <malay>tapi tak</malay> okay <malay>kot</malay
ya <malay>memang</malay> [lah] (um) to plan the wedding is not very easy so I think is one phase at a time but despite all these challenges must really look at it like <malay>macam secara</malay> positive ya so at least that <malay>macam</malay> you know what you can (um) do best within this (err
(uh) constrain the constraints of it then from there you workout on it [lah] so let's talk about happy things [lah] <malay>macam</malay> stress [jer] <malay>cerita cerita macam begini kita buat cerita cerita</malay> happy <malay>pulak dalam pasal pasal</malay> wedding <malay>ni</malay
so <malay>kirakan</malay> okay actually that time you got share with me [kan] <malay>tentang mak andam</malay> like quality of <malay>mak andam</malay
that's good actually is one advantage so she just going to spend a lot of on her coming honeymoon maybe next year there's one of her plan [lah
ya okay <malay>macam itu kira</malay> not too bad [lah] [kan] because anyway the number of guest is being cut down ya actually if you ask me if you want to make use of the pandemic als
very good if you you all like <malay>macam</malay> prepare and then both both parents are okay [ah] it's just anyway you also have time also <malay>nak</malay> save money you kno
but then you have to stay in one place for two years [lah] or in fact one year next year I think I don't think they will open for thousand people stil
ya I think still about one hundred or hundred fifty the most y
frankly speaking (err) is a good time to be use if you already have some budget even for like hundred fifty guests or hundred then if both ar
okay [kan] then at least like you know you all can have the wedding first and then after that [ah
the money surplus keep first can go for honeymoon because I'm pretty sure by that time maybe can go new zealand because (um) certain country [dah] already open [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> you can just like chill relax [lah] <malay>macam</malay
<malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] <malay>macam nak fikir fikir sangat</malay> [kan] then after that at the same time there's another part of money can still keep saving for one year for the house [ah] that's another advantage [lah
[ah] <malay>ini pun</malay> if let's say both side okay [lah] I know it like I think both of you you both of you I think you will like <malay>kita macam</malay> like okay [jer] like <malay>nikah</malay> is that correc
[oh] I think that part can't be helped right we all <malay>memang</malay> [lah] <malay>keluarga melayu ni mesti nak macam</malay> happy happ
know you are like can can just like (uh) <malay>kita sama sama</malay> you know <malay>ramai ramai meraikan</malay> !chey! <malay>macam meraikan ilmu pulak tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>saja mengeratkan silaturahim</malay> so I think can [lah] I think we jus
(uh) take it positively and then now do live streaming also possible what you just need to pay additional for the live streaming [lah] so there's one one idea you can hav
[ah] but now I think for now don't take it as (uh) <malay>macam sedih nak kahwin</malay> [kan] you just more like if all the all the (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> restriction constraint you just take it like what can be done during that point that point of time [lah
ya so I think for you for now don't stress too much but it's just that you all just save as much but you both <malay>kena bincang</malay
<malay>sebaiknya</malay> like what can you like save like within a month you know and then what to work on the next next month <malay>macam kena ada</malay> like your own goals [lah] but if let's say if both of you like very <malay>nekad</malay
or very determine like what you want <malay>nak buat</malay> [kan] like <malay>macam tak kisahlah apa orang nak cakap</malay> [kan] <malay>biarlah</malay> you know so basically you just can just ignore and then you all like determine what you all want to hav
(um) to prioritise [lah] then <malay>kalau</malay> let's say family <malay>kata</malay> [oh] no no no no I just want to have the big wedding you know you have to then you just sit [lah] [ah] okay option one I let go the fla
you can have the big wedding but (err) we have to burden one of the side [lah
must stay don't know until when because after that don't know how your selection because I heard once you withdraw you want to apply again can take some time if no
if not ya ya that's what I hear
then if not alternative you do the resale flat [lah] [kan
[ah] that's another option [lah] that means to get a resale flat maybe <malay>dalam</malay> three five years that <malay>macam</malay> [ah] you know our relativ
some of them <malay>ada</malay> so you can have like that or another one that you also can have like (uh) just a another second option you tell them okay I can have only this budget both of u
okay so (err) if you want to have this guest is up to your own description of expense
you know [ah] <malay>sendiri sendiri yang macam nak</malay> spend [lah] so if let's say if this side <malay>kata</malay> okay <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] can we can come out each another to ten thousand ten thousan
[ah] then okay then so <malay>semua boleh</malay> centralised <malay>atau pun nak</malay> separate <malay>itu</malay> another one [lah] [ah] because I thin
about <malay>tunang</malay> he can never be meet everywhere [lah] [kan] like <malay>macam semua</malay> happ
then that that is the fact in life I think it's very very difficult you cannot make everyone happy so I think we can only do what is the best of the situation <malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>macam boleh</malay
then okay [loh] <malay>kalau tak boleh</malay> [oh] too bad [lah] because (um) either or I think there's only some loss factor for example if they use option on
you lost your down payment of two thousand dollars from the but maybe you don't put your your your plus point you need to think about renovations you are just focus on one poin
and then (uh) so you spend lavishly [ah] your your whatever you needed to okay that but you need to spend five years three to five year
for you to (uh) come back and then apply again for another flat there is another factor [lah] okay then if there's an option two that both parties <malay>cakap</malay> okay [lah] why not we bought (uh) you know <malay>yang</malay
norms [lah] <malay>sederhana</malay> [jer] like very minimal number of (um) (err) what you call number of peopl
then after that then that's it [lah] finish okay [dah] <malay>tak ada lagi</malay> [lah] that is the the the point of it ya so that is one of i
ya ya actually but before you all have a discussion (uh) of course you separately have to talk to your own parent
then that means but you prefer you talk to your parents both of you like <malay>macam tahu</malay> okay <malay>kita ada</malay> this amount <malay>kita ada ni kita boleh</malay> prepare <malay>macam ini</malay> [ah] then [ah
<malay>orang</malay> [ah] <malay>orang mampu macam ini</malay> [jer] [lah] [kan] like it's like you know we can't be #bo# #chap# in everything <malay>sebab</malay> we just have to be like telling what we hav
on the table then after that (err) you <malay>apa ni</malay
[oh] ya then your your when both of you display what is on the table and then let them decide [lah
[ah] what they want [lah] [ah] because I thin
(err) for you both all you want is just <malay>nikah</malay> maybe take beautiful pictures go (err) nice honeymoon then [dah] <malay>habis</malay> then after that focus <malay>kat rumah</malay
[oh] okay okay <malay>mas kahwin</malay> is (err) more important than <malay>hantaran hantaran</malay> is culture <malay>mas kahwin</malay> is <malay>agama</malay
[ah] so <malay>mas kahwin</malay> is part of the (err) <malay>macam dalam dalam</malay> term <malay>dia dalam</malay> arab is called <malay>maha</malay
so <malay>maha</malay> is the compulsory amount that you supposed to provide so the amount <malay>yang kita dapat tu</malay> minimum is actually is if I am not mistaken <malay>yang kasi</malay> the minimum amount then other than that above is up to yo
[ah] you know so that is the the initial so in ya I think in don't know which <malay>negeri</malay> ya <malay>dia orang lagi</malay> emphasise <malay>mas kahwin</malay> then a gift gift <malay>tu hantaran</malay> [lah] <malay>bagi dia orang</malay> [ah] that is culture <malay>melayu kita ni terbalik</malay> [ah
<malay>macam</malay> [ah] gift <malay>tu lebih</malay> high <malay>daripada mas kahwin</malay> but right it should be another way but I think (err) <malay>mas kahwin ke</malay
(err) <malay>hantaran</malay> (err) for me [lah] I think it all depends on the affordability yes correct to have that amount is for you your parents <malay>cakap tak nak ambil</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> the thing i
even for you the amount to them is a a stipulated savings that you can have one shot for your house but I think along the way (err) sometimes <malay>rilek</malay> [jer] [lah
(err) you can have the best of both worlds [kan] <malay>jadi kita kena tengok mana yang lagi</malay> important [lah] [kan] [ah
that's why I said despite the whole thing now seems already [dah] <malay>pening kepala</malay> [lah] [kan] like very (um) you know so you you just got to <malay>doa</malay> for awhile <malay>rilek</malay> you know don't need to thin
(err) so in detail yet but at least to think okay now <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] you know what is among all these things <malay>yang macam</malay
(err) mix up what is it like like you think that [oh] what I want to have [oh] I want to have nice photos then you just think that okay nice photos focus what photograph I want then how much budget are from it [lah
like you can because you think things that you can control <malay>macam</malay> budget photographer your brother [ah] these are the things that no need to involve family wha
like bridal studio photo or this not belong to family right even the exchange of <malay>hantaran</malay> also not belong to family so anyone want to give extra is a plus poin
but other than that [ah] if let's say for example [ah] we exchange (err) three <malay>saja</malay> [lah] item let's say for exampl
okay [ah] for example [a'ah] <malay>cuma satu</malay> I this one I don't know [eh] <malay>dulu</malay> I should have known luckily I never [ah] exchanged <malay>quran</malay> do you know that what is i
in other in one I read about in (err) on here like for example you know certain things when you exchange actually for example sensitive thing [lah
like (uh) okay so <malay>jada</malay> is common <malay>tapi</malay> [seh] <malay>jada kita tahu</malay> you will be used for (um) after marriage in when we play together but when talking about <malay>quran</malay> and something like actually you must actually reflect the whole when you <malay>hantar al quran</malay
I don't okay y
you mean the <malay>hantaran</malay
both side actually exchange gift [ah] how many you want to have it depend
[oh] <malay>duit</malay> that one that one is the <malay>mas [eh] <malay>ini</malay> not <malay>mas</malay> [kan] that one is (err) !alah! <malay>hantaran</malay> [lah] ya [lah] but some give cheque [ah] nowaday
ya I saw all my friends they give the cheque but I think now cheque they were really better PayLah PayNow [lah] no need [lah] I pay now [loh
ya correct correct so I think it can be just a symbolic amoun
or can be just a cheque amount ya that is one thing of it [lah] ya if you ask me can be cheque <malay>kosong</malay> [ha] [ha] [ha] [ha
okay what righ
cheque <malay>kosong</malay> what but inside is PayNow [leh] is direct transfe
[ah] so is all depends [lah] but again if follow tradition ya [lah] they want to see for real to sure <malay>masih</malay> cash you know you know bank not
[ah] but I think in today's context can be just lik
like a normal cheque just to display in fact if you ask me a paper also okay but <malay>mesti</malay> there's a transaction and PayNow
if not screen shot and then you se
(mm) it happens [ah] actually happens during my time also is like [oh] because they only said [lah] when you actually in engagement phase that there's a lot of challenges gaming up coming up so [ah] ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay
like you say like you know some can we stand some cannot <malay>tapi</malay> to know each other's partner is very very important so i
if let's say you know the [oh] your partner [ah] really can't afford this right so but he he he he's willing to take care of you he's willing to you know he can take care of yo
you know that means that if you have a flat together what know you all still are able to maintain its just you all need time need the time to start up or maintain so it's either two way either (um
like I said [lah] is the thumb comes with terms of agreement like either you all actuall
(uh) get the support of family either by you can stay to the other place one of the houses you know for like three to five two to five years and then we get married earlie
or you actually like (err) like both family are agreeable to have a smaller budget then all had to start out on the ne
home ya because if you ask me this term it takes a village to raise children but I always believe it takes a village to even start a hom
so I think like this (uh) family support is one factor very very important to me [lah] that's why (err) I mean culturally <malay>kita melayu</malay> is very united <malay>satu hati</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>kita</malay> you know [lah] we are lik
we always like (um) always don't forget like what to do I mean what to to help out even like with friends you know like we hear when peoples <malay>susah</malay> even like just now you say comments comments just now righ
not none of our business also [lah] but the thing is like people also like <malay>sibuk</malay> and go and go and comment y
ya [lah] she wants the opinio
[oh] it depends some some partners maybe like they do in front of you like they buy you lavishly and all that <malay>tapi</malay> out there maybe <malay>dia pakai</malay> card card card <malay>tapi tak</malay> shar
[ah] there are couples are like that like they because they don't stay in a one home under one roof right so of course there are things that you can hid
and then maybe like (err) the person (uh) then where the family said firmly talk [oh] it is a very well to do but initially it is not you know that (uh) kind of situations o
per per per person or individual like that like <malay>macam tak tunjuk</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay
(err) like no communication with their families feel like <malay>tak tunjuk</malay> or what [lah] ya so that can happen [tau] <malay>macam</malay
<malay>tak tak tak ada</malay> then why you ask me after seven years dating <malay>pun tak tahu dia ni buat apa ke kaya ke</malay> [kan] maybe all the while the guy only show up front [oh] <malay>aku ada hadiahkan</malay> best best you kno
[ah] <malay>dia bukan pun tak tunjuk</malay> kind of thing some some can leave that up staging on staging [eh] <malay>macam berlakon</malay> staging up everyday which like to me it's excruciating [ah] but some people ya carry on maybe like for example <malay>dia</malay> partner no [ah
the other party <malay>tu tak ada duit</malay> maybe <malay>tak</malay> you know not affordable or whatever but she she will ask and then she always try to give her so he thought or maybe [lah] should be okay [lah] <malay>nanti kahwin pun</malay> okay [lah] <malay>macam sekarang</malay
(um) he has so many money <malay>aku minta pun</malay> okay [jer] [ah] you know sounds like but I the end when the person say [oh] (uh) he's in debt for the wedding <malay>ini</malay> ya actually that is not the only on
I think <malay>dari zaman</malay> our grandfather they are always this occasion people last time if you watch P #ramlee# sho
[ah] lie [lah] borrow the #chetty# [lah] you know that that particular #chetty# will always just borrow lend the money to them what (um) high interest and then end up <malay>hutang</malay> because because our tradition that our culture that sometim
(err) kills the that particular portion [lah] but in this younger generation in your generation (err) things have changed progressivel
then like for example ya you you want to prioritise on this you have to have budget and so is it again like assist supporting the family [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> family understand family <malay>tahu</malay> what you can what you cannot and the
it's okay we'll like for example like a friend of mine both of them !wah! very have good job then they get flat <malay>dengan</malay> with their pa
they cannot even get flat [eh] they must buy a condo or private propert
[ah] high ceiling income but then (err) there's one period of time he changed jo
so there's (uh) about three months is like or four months ya <malay>tak</malay> start he take a break but he got ready a job to start later on so he used tha
you know that particular period and try to appeal you know [ah] and then they finally got it [ah] then but there's a word then the reaso
(err) a a very meticulous person who are very fact this or more usually this happens in a matured couple [lah] ya where the
ready above thirties then they think long term already so like when I ask you both like above ten should be able what stay in condominuim or what then they say no [lah] to think tha
I have to pay more than half a million for the house I could headache already [ah
that's why he told me [lah] [kan] so like <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>kelakar</malay> then I was like abby you all <malay>gaji</malay> seventy eight thousand [dah
like very stress then me [leh] then ho
then like let me [oh] <malay>mampus</malay> [ah] like that like that then he said no [lah] it's just tha
(uh) you know the more th
the you earn actually the more expenses we have you know like (uh) like <malay>macam peribahasa melayu apa</malay> the <malay>apa kerak nasi makin tebal makin</malay
[ah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] don't know [lah] there's this particular you know so basically this is the this is the part that he always remind me that [lah] which I always think [oh
okay for you maybe because your parents comes not in my generation slightly older generation so apparently like you know they have certain exception (um) but agai
I thought generation we're beyond discussion they always have a room for discussion but the thing you as
to know you usually parents [ah] whether to let go kids to <malay>kahwin</malay> I think me as a parent I will only see whether are you ready financially emotionall
you know and [ah] both ways [lah] both parties [lah] so (uh) people might say money not no money is a need when you want to start a family but did did as a parent you look at these two aspects [lah
if financially you okay then no need to be so damn rich [lah] right no need to be like so <malay>kaya</malay> or whatever you just need to have like (um
[ah] more than enough like can start [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you can pay your bills you know you can you can (uh) you can have a proper food you know don't end up like until like when you have kid
(err) want to want to buy a normal <malay>sayur</malay> or <malay>kangkung</malay
also you have enough that's a situation like that okay but you are working you know so that is the one funny part sometimes that can happen that's why I say [ah
financial planning to me is it is very important though I'm not a very good financial manage myself but the thing is at least from the mistakes I learned I share with my kids I say you al
(um) when you work you have to think is I always remind that's why like when when when my <malay>anak</malay> when all of you come to me my <malay>anak anak saudara</malay> ask me about weddin
my concept is what is your vision <malay>apakah</malay> your <malay>punya</malay> vision to achieve in building live together if your vision is to hav
okay a stable marriage a stable home then to me is wedding to have a lavish or not is secondary because bottom line you want to stable yourself you <malay>nak</malay> make sure tha
you start something that with no <malay>hutang</malay> you know because basically you you start something with <malay>hutang</malay> you got headach
I am not saying when you are together you know <malay>hutang</malay> [lah] [kan] you will have you got kids already <malay>hutang</malay> will be there bu
is not as if you are not able to pay that's the only thing [lah] [ah] because <malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau memang kita ada segalanya memang</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau kita anak anak sultan</malay> #johor# <malay>ke</malay> daughters <malay>sultan</malay> daughters of <malay>sultan</malay> johor can [lah
[ah] then you anything you want or you want a lavish wedding can and you want a good honeymoon good then you want to have a very beautiful flats also ca
ya involves money ya but the thin
but the thing don't let it kill you [lah] that's why I said (err) in this case [kan] <malay>suka ke tidak</malay> instrinsic back breakdown <malay>tu kena ada</malay
[ah] introduce you must have really must have because if not [lah] if you ask me [lah] !wah! very #jialat# [lah] like every everything also must <malay>risau</malay> bu
really we really have to have to do it because if not later you have problems and then (um) you can't convince your parents lik
what can be cut down what can don't need to cut down I mean <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> convince like that <malay>macam</malay> like for example [ah] you kno
fathers [oh] <malay>mesti nak ada lima ratus</malay> okay bu
because you already give a picture you know what can be done what cannot be done then your parents [ah] okay [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>sembarang</malay> [ah] he will come to a point like that I know my brothe
like he will come to a point <malay>apa-apa suka hati</malay> okay [lah] <malay>korang</malay> [dah] plan [kan] okay okay <malay>tak apa</malay
[ah] <malay>engkau</malay> continue okay I will I will support you it will come to that bottom lin
