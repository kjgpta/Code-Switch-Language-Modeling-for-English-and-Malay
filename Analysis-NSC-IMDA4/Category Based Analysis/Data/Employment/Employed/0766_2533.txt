[oh] that [one] that [one] we haven't plan yet
but knowing #angah# I think he wants to eat
malay food like <malay>nasi</malay>
!aww! this [one] is nice
but I think because of the adults <malay>itu</malay> [lah] I think ya
that's why it's expensive
I press wrongly where do I press
okay
and then I show you the Amara hotel [eh]
because the Amara hotel what what my (uh) what I
thought that I
(err) should do right
is I will take two separate room
and then one room is me <malay>kak</malay> #ain# #aryan# and
my younger brother and then another room is for my parents [lah] so they can <malay>apa ni</malay>
at least they can spend the night together
since it's his <malay>hari jadi</malay> also my father
there
<malay>lagi lagi dia</malay> half price [seh] of the Pan Pacific <malay>tapi</malay> like okay [lah] like like we cannot be together in one room [lah]
[oh] they they have the two bedroom apartment
there price for five adults six one seven okay [lah]
let's see the photos
but I know they <malay>baru</malay> recently just renovated [tau]
Amara
!huh! got no plate
Maggi
you know like some hotel <malay>macam</malay> they the shower and everything is in the bathtub right but I don't want that but but I know Amara is not like that
because like how [mah] want to
shower right
like quite difficult
but two bedroom okay [lah] #ilham# can sleep outside
ya
this [one] [oh] okay [dah] I think this is the [one] that I wanted to take
[eh] no <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay <malay>ni</malay>
#angah# don't like gardens by the bay he went before and he's like
why am I looking at plants
why am I paying to look at plants
<malay>dia tak suka</malay>
like <malay>dia kata</malay> like very boring [seh]
okay this one is for three adults right
so I was thinking that okay [lah] either way [lah] like if (uh) <malay>adik</malay> want to if my younger want to sleep with
(uh) <malay>ayah</malay> and #ma# then go ahead
they can sleep
on the floor [lah] of course [lah] with the with the mattress right
but two eight zero and then if I times two it's still cheaper
but we will not be in the same room but I don't mind that [lah] as long as you know
it's a staycation then I wanted breakfast also then this one also there
got breakfast
included
not bad right
I guess
I think I will I really think I will <malay>bangun pagi</malay> if
I were I I'm in that kind of mood
the artscience museum <malay>yang dekat</malay> <malay>tak</malay>
is it
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>dia</malay>
(mmhmm)
that sounds fun
ya <malay>kot</malay>
can consider
can can <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
or the another one is this one also Ascott [oh] the price [oh] my god
[dah] <malay>naik</malay> [seh] price <malay>dia</malay>
actually the the last time I saw it is about five hundred plus
is a apartment also
(mm)
[oh] when are we receiving that [ah]
ya
because it's every tourist attraction place right
ya ya ya ya I think he will appreciate now at this age

(mm)(mm)(mm)
I think he will also like I think he will also like (um) <malay>apa tu lagi satu tu</malay>
no another one
ya I think he will like adventure cove also
since he like water
ya
I think so I think if it's like once in a while kind of thing I think he will join in it will be awkward [lah] but I think he
I think he don't mind
need to <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
no [eh] ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya I told you I liked it what
are you the one who told me you don't like it
ya
why [ah] why you don't like it
[oh] is it
what did you have
a a what
[oh]
(mm) okay [lah] I will decide
[oh] ya ya ya
(mm)
<malay>mana</malay> notes [ah]
I also have it every month
(err) <malay>abeh</malay> (um) okay [lah] I will decide
on the itinerary
ya <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak</malay> (um)
okay for me
for me the most memorable meal that I ever had is when I went to japan
and I eat that (um) indian restaurant
because I seriously I I don't think that
a foreign country
will have
will have like
a nice indian food
you know what you mean I I I I thought like <malay>macam</malay> the culture is
is like a bit weird [lah] so when I taste it [eh] I thought that it's going to be bad but then like [oh] my god it's so nice
(err) I ate the prawn green curry you the #naan#
it's so nice I I I think I still remember the taste until today
ya
no because we (uh) we
(mm) it's too loud (mm)
because we we passed by and then after that we thought [eh]
<malay>macam</malay> [eh] can [ah] like craving something local because like that is how many days already we are there
then every time eat like either fast food or Maggi or like some japanese noodle
so was like okay [lah]
and then I don't really like #udon#
that's why maybe I don't (mm)
your japanese curry curry also I don't like
ya I just feel like that it's like just like a paste
doesn't taste anything
ya so
when I taste it I was like [eh] <malay>sedap</malay> [seh] then like
(err) okay [lah] I mean it's quite expensive
maybe when I convert it into like
singapore dollars like (uh)
seventeen dollars I think per serving
seventeen dollar [tau] for a green prawn curry it's not even with rice it's with
#naan#
okay [lah] it's worthy it's an experience and then I was like okay !wow! I I I don't ever have
<malay>macam</malay> like this kind of food
<malay>bila dekat</malay> singapore
I didn't even taste like any indian food that taste like that
food ya ya ya ya
no
I didn't
but
(mm) (mm) (mm)
they had it they have it in singapore now right is it
nice
four dollar something
(mmhmm)(mm)(mm)(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya ya
ya at first I didn't know but then I had it we had it in #bali# remember the the Yoshinoya
the #yakiniku# beef
is it the same thing
[ah]
but then that one the one that I ate also called #yakiniku# beef why
[oh] wait
maybe maybe maybe
[oh] is it
(mm)
what do you think for you because I I might take awhile to think about that
I will definitely okay dish is it okay okay I want
ya I wanted to say rice then I was like okay it's not dish
ya it is
is it not I feel like
ya
ya
you choose #mee soto#
[oh] okay
<malay>susah</malay> [eh]
ya me too
okay if given a choice
I would probably
for me I think it'll be chicken
ya I think
I think it'll be my mum's (err) <malay>ayam lemak cili padi</malay>
for the rest of my life
or carbonara
it's either one but I don't know [what]
because if I take that <malay>ayam lemak cili padi</malay> then can I can it be served <malay>dengan nasi</malay> or no if no <malay>nasi</malay> then I don't want it
because it need to be with <malay>nasi</malay> [lah] hot piping <malay>nasi</malay>
I think my I think my mum my mum's (err) <malay>nasi goreng</malay>
<malay>nasi goreng daging</malay> is nice also
I mean if a dish that like got everything inside like protein and everything okay [lah] then the <malay>nasi goreng</malay> I think is a good choice
probably I want to add one fried egg on top
<malay>telur mata lembu</malay> on top
the runny one
ya
ya I think it's a dish
I think I want to be rihanna for one day
she
ya she's cool
and then she is very like (um)
independent and then she can do whatever she want
although I know she worked hard for it [lah]
of course right
but like <malay>macam</malay> like when you become her
it's like
you don't even like maybe need to care about
I don't know taking care of
[oh] but she's not an actor she's a singer
if celebrity [ah] rihanna I think I would want to be rihanna for
for for like one day
I wake up and then it's like [oh] my god [oh] my god I'm trapped in rihanna's body
then I can like I think and then during that one day that I'm her
I think I just enjoy life
like all the money she have and then probably I'll grab all her beauty lines
I'm her right by the #wayi# can just like (err) can I
ya can I just like (err) take this home home where
ya
and then I will I will like I don't know
I even though I'm scared to take
(err) helicopter
probably I would for that one day
and then
ya
and then ya
I think it'll be pretty cool to be her
for one day
let's see what kind of life she leads
I think so I think her her house got a lot of you know like those
celebrity house like they stay alone but they got a lot of rooms
I don't know why
<malay>tak tahu</malay> like I really seriously <malay>tak tahu</malay> why they need like <malay>banyak banyak bilik</malay>
like <malay>bilik dorang banyak</malay> [tau] like
like whenever the article came out okay like rihanna room (uh) house is like seven million
(err) with twenty four bedroom
ten toilets (err) attached (uh) with (uh) indoor swimming pool
I was like why
who else stay there rihanna I wanted to ask her
okay maybe if I'm her and I can figure out that who else stays there
in that twenty four
probably
ya man
or <malay>macam main</malay> hide and seek <malay>ke</malay>
scary [siol]
I don't think I can
don't [ah]
will smith
I I hadn't
is it
(ugh)
(mmhmm)
and then they put there as a meme
okay [oh] ya ya ya ya I saw it I saw it like
celebrities like stay home
and then celebrity home is like
that big
ya but like
they have a lot of things to do in their house I don't think they'll be bored they can swim
they can probably play play tennis basketball
and maybe they got like movie like indoor movie ya
and then we we're like okay
<malay>dekat dalam</malay> flat like (err)
buy one get one free
[oh] you mean like okay okay I don't know
(hmm)
I don't think any one for one free deal is
a bad thing
unless if I like cannot choose what is my one for one
for example like okay if you go Starbucks you can
but you know sometimes Starbucks got this day that they have one for one but only for certain drinks
[ah] okay then that kind of deal like okay [lah] [meh] I don't want to buy because maybe the drinks I don't want okay [lah] maybe that one is a bit worse
like !huh! one for one
but I don't get to choose
ya but <malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>macam</malay> let's say they
but usually one for one is like okay the higher price you pay and then the lower
ya okay that one is already (um) <malay>macam</malay>
standard [lah]
ya ya ya ya
actualy ya I mean
good looks or fit body
what would you prefer
because like the body [ah]
[ha]
I think the face you look at it every day like <malay>hari hari tengok</malay>
then can you imagine that you are angry at the person and then like (ugh)
looking at the face is so more annoying because it's like
the face is already annoying
ya ya ya
face
I think it'll be that I think it'll be a bit hard to reconstruct
or like <malay>tukar</malay> the face in like
ya
ya
and ya like imagine
[dah] <malay>sapau sapau muka macam</malay>
I don't even wanna say
I like crime documentaries ya bearing channel is the crime investigation channel makeup to me too
ya me too
me too me too
ya even though like (uh)
okay I like crime and I like law
I think they are two separate things [lah] maybe some law they just deal with like
whatever
ya like court cases or like how lawyers act in general how they
(err)
go all out to save their client even though their clients is wrong
you know they like they just
fight for their clients [eh] no no no (uh) like he or she is not wrong
[ah] no <malay>dia macam dia tak dia tak</malay> murder that person <malay>dia tak</malay> kill that person is it
and everything like that and then
[ah] I like like ya I like (uh) true crime stories
I like like last time I like
like when it
when it shows on channel five
during like I think about nine
after the news nine o'clock news [oh] I like serious I
ya I mean the whole I I don't know whether they are still
around but I don't think they are (um)
that
popular anymore
ya I think the older season is better the miami miami
I think it's one of the
I remember that detective the one that doesn't smile I forgot what's his name
ya
and ya I think okay horror right I think it's
something
if the
if the plot case is good
(uh) or like paranormal activity all these like
(um) (uh) cable (uh) ya
a good movie correct
ya they want to like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] this is we captured it for the camera
you know it happens ya ya ya ya
ya
then
(err) ya ya ya
ya
(mm)
correct correct
ya
ya I like her also I think I watch almost all her videos already
ya ya ya ya ya the Facebook one I already
watch
ya
what [ah]
[ah] chris watts [ah] is it the chris watts
the [one] that she the [one] that the the
ya the [one] that the guy killed the wife and the kids right
ya ya ya
actually the when the chris watts things happened right
(um)
I was pregnant it was in two zero one eight
and then the news came out and then I was thinking I was talking
I was
talking to my colleague like
how can (uh) on earth can anyone do this to their kids and their
and their partner I was like thinking like okay [lah] maybe
the partner is abusive or maybe like you know there's so many maybe's but then when the story came out I was like
you should watch it
no the movie just recently
two zero one two is when the murder happened
so it's just recently only
ya
Netflix the Netflix [one] [eh]
I I think it's badly down because
they didn't show the who story like
I watch the documentary it's like they didn't
like this chris watts
okay he's a narcissist right I think he is a downright narcissist he just didn't know
or he just know but he just
(uh) I mean he's a narcissist what (uh) eventually he will just gonna act that [oh] no it's not my fault you know and things like that
by they in that Netflix documentary I think they did they failed to include a lot of either evidence that was was found like
like the fact that like he had (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> (err) he got a mistress
(err) (uh) okay it's a girlfriend <malay>yang</malay> he knows
about two months prior prior to the wedding [eh] prior to the murder sorry
ya like <malay>macam</malay>
but you should include all these because it's I mean okay they in that documentary
<malay>dorang</malay> actually did include
(err) the girlfriend [lah] but
in some sense they didn't say that okay the girlfriend
actually is the
okay the girlfriend actually did some search on on on
on her Google
asking like that that she was searching things that
a bit suspicious [lah]
and then after that like she know that this guy is
married
with a with a wife that is fifteen weeks pregnant
and then she still you know
ya so I think she's a bit suspicious and
the whole story doesn't add up
but ya you should watch
you should watch soon
if you are given three wishes what would you wish for
what would you wish for
okay
and then
to be honest if I had three wish right I think my wish my first two wish would be
I think I had a few wish when growing up but then it's always the same one
number one is
ya like I never
like I never like (um)
not <malay>kecil</malay> [lah] maybe when I was a teenager
okay when I started working
okay like I was like pre-teen maybe like eighteen like that right I always thought that okay like
I wish that
I wish
my first wish is that
me and whole family can live in a big house
like a landed house and then
and then
and then money will not be a problem that's my first wish
and then my second wish is always the same
like a big house like not castle [lah] like
at least it's a landed landed house especially we stay in singapore you know it's very expensive
ya
ya
ya where my parents can actually like (uh) grow old and they don't need to worry about you know
retirement ya I think that's my wish since ever since I'm I'm I'm I'm quite young
ya then my second wish is okay my second wish is actually the [one] that
I had after I had
#aryan# after I had my first baby
which is I wish that
(uh) healthy okay [lah] healthy is subjective [lah]
but I just wish that he will
be smart
and be loyal
to the people that
love him [ah] like <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>atuk nenek dia punya dia punya</malay>
especially to his <malay>atuk nenek</malay> [lah] because like
this
two people is the [one] <malay>yang apa ni</malay> bring you up
take care of you when you are young [kan] so I think
ya
in the future he needs to
return the favour [lah] I think he really need to <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] [dah] <malay>besar</malay> he will need to realise [oh] [eh] actually I <malay>nak</malay>
I need to (err) <malay>jaga</malay> my <malay>atuk</malay> and <malay>nenek</malay> I need (uh) anything that
(err) they need I have to
do it
for them
[ah] and then my third wish actually
(uh) I don't have a third wish until recently
like I just wish that COVID will end
really I think I think COVID is like one of the worst I mean
I was I was still (uh) I'm already pretty
[oh] I
(err) when SARS happened I mean I I'm quite young
and I know about it happen because <malay>kita kat sekolah</malay> [kan]
we're schooling I think
where are you
I think around I'm in secondary school
(err) (uh) (um) lower secondary
then I think
ya ya ya that that was what (uh) <malay>apa yang</malay> I mean [lah] like
I really think <malay>yang</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay> is like
one of the worst things that happened
like
ya
I know right and then and then a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> nothing you know they like have a job and then the next time they don't have
a job and the they are not even prepared for it
<malay>macam</malay> like things happened just like that and there are a lot of people the most
thing the most like <malay>macam paling sedih</malay> that I've heard
is that like
if a country have like
so many thousands of death in one day like indonesia you can go up to like thousand deaths in one day like
who are this one thousand people like how do they get it
I think at the back of my head [kan] I will actually really think like then I was like [eh] like quite sad [lah] like
they are somebody's
(err)
father daughter or like kids
and then they just have to die
due to you know
ya
ya and then after that you are at the risk also because maybe you know
so it's quite sad [lah]

november
second november
ya ya ya I went I went for medical check-up then after that
(err) actually is is
is just to check whether you done your immunisation [lor]
no because you <malay>nak kena kerja dengan</malay> kids [kan]
then you need to be immunised because they are high
likely to be infected if you have any and then with only one kid
you know like things like chicken pox and all this
but
but
good for me that I've done all the immunisation when I'm young and I already got chicken pox so I no need to take anything
just like x-ray and then there everything is okay already
then ya [lah] I pass
so
you know that day I went for (uh) a a pre-trial
to be a pre
pre-trial teacher
at white lodge which is actually just here only <malay>kat</malay> west coast road
and white lodge is (um)
it's a private (uh) institution
ya it's a private (err) it's a private school [lah] it's not a government it's not a co-education or anything it's just a private on its own
but it's (uh) it's actually
it's as at a landed property
ya
is is ya it's a huge (um)
ya it's a child care it's a huge child care and after that
no go inside go inside
teach
yes yes
yes depends on the group that they in [ah] okay like the the one I went I went (uh) from eight thirty to one
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> I have to (um)
I have to (err) assign them to groups
say like okay today this is your group okay they are classmates [lah] but they are they are like
one teacher (err) to a ratio of
no
more fifteen kids one five
depending on the group so <malay>kat</malay> over there the the the smaller the the smallest is three years old
you don't really infant ya this module ya the younger you don't have infant or anything like that
we don't have infant
ya the smallest ya the youngest
we don't have infant or anything like that
then (um)
after that the okay so what I did was like (uh)
I assisted
ya they they are from three
to six
okay so
what I did was
(um) I assisted
the lead teacher
to you know do activities with the children [lah] (um) okay the first half the eight thirty to
eleven twenty <malay>tu yang</malay> before the lunchtime <malay>[kan]</malay> I actually assisted the teachers
(um)
for kids that (uh) the age of three until
four
ya they they are like toddlers they are still toddlers and then but most of them all is all potty trained
that's what I'm amazed and <malay>dorang punya</malay> culture is very diverse because most is all
#ang moh#
and then mixed race like japanese and #ang moh#
like (um) japanese and japanese korean and (uh) sweden
like swedish sweden <malay>pula</malay> (um)
<malay>banyak</malay> [ah] like
okay it's
they talk in english they is hard to get a local [one]
there is one or two local like chinese
there's no malay there's no indian
ya there are more into into international (uh) so the culture and all is different
I guess or maybe because of the location
[orh] ya ya ya ya ya ya is at the west coast area there so is
[ah] <malay>sakit kenapa sakit</malay> (hmm)
eight thirty to five [lah]
office hour then after that saturday sunday we are they they are closed
that's the good thing because (uh) if you go under government
saturday you're (uh) open half day
then you need to alternate working [ah]
on saturdays with you colleagues
but this [one] like saturday sunday you are closed and then [what] I like is that
the parents
usually they are working from home or they are not working
or they have maids so they will not
like pick up the kids l am bet
or anything no such thing
like they actually come on time and so it's half of the kids so in total
(uh) plus <malay>yang</malay> kid <malay>umur</malay>
three to six <malay>dengan</malay>
(err) five to [eh] sorry three to four <malay>dengan</malay> five five to six <malay>tu</malay>
total there will be there is about like forty five kids

so at least they got
anytime after one before one cannot

sticky or they like sweaty
the teachers will ask them to shower
