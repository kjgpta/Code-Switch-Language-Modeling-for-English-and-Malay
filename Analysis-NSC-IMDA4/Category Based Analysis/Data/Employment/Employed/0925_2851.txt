[ah] uni at is that premium
so it's just a one year course so ya
a maritime in logistics I think there they have actually two course so they have a maritime law and actually and maritime logistic so I'm think I'm having interest in the logistics so <malay>macam</malay> and I feel that <malay>lagi senang</malay> [ah]
ya
one year
ya just one year
one year and is only for like a forty K
forty K including the food and the house
ya ya but then weekly need to pay around like (um) eight hundred weekly [ah] for the rent yes yes ya correct
including [ah] including their school fees and stuff ya four thousand but it's actually okay [ah]
ya
ya but it's a more of a countryside <malay>punya tempat</malay> (mm) so okay [lah] there's no distractions I think
ya so what are you gonna do like like stick in this job
are you thinking of upgrading yourself
[oh] ya how long how long you have you work
(oo) that's fast
are you planning to change to what industry
[oh] ya but now also not the time to change cause of COVID
ya correct
ya correct there's no job
[oh] ya ya a lot of people are looking into (um) childcare jobs
ya
ya correct you have to take the course
you can take part time I don't know if it's subsidised or something it is it
<malay>tak tahu ke kakak kau</malay>
[oh] [oh] the or the swag yes correct correct [oh]
[oh]
worth it [lah] because it's for long term like for until you die [what] you hold that cert
[oh] the
P C or something is it (uh huh) [oh] you wait until you are twenty five day then you can get the
the work and learn shit I don't know [ah] what is it
(uh) okay then you can upgrade yourself [what] then
(mmhmm)
(um)
but what if they don't upgrade you you know now is not the time for promotion or
no increment [lah]
[oh]
admin you know admin actually
actually is a really a good job because like <malay>dekat</malay> that time intern <malay>tempat</malay> intern <malay>aku</malay> bourbon
<malay>kau tahu tak</malay> admin earn <malay>berapa</malay>
two point five thousand yes they earn a lot
ya no because I think you see industry <malay>mana</malay> [lah] like I feel like <malay>kalau kau</malay> should search in
maritime <malay>punya</malay> admin cause they don't go they don't go on board
they just <malay>duduk</malay> office and just (um)
they just sit office and book flights for the managers just simple admin stuff like or the food cause my
friend is admin <malay>dekat</malay> maritime that time <malay>dekat</malay> bourbon so she earn two point five but then after after the is ready is one point nine ya correct
she don't travel along right no no she'd never travel
which admin which department
because depends on department like my friend is a admin for like (err) department admin
so like she's like the receptionist
so so like when you enter she's there
(uh) ya don't have the more so but then now she move on to a better job that job offers her two point seven now
under law <malay>punya</malay> admin
two points seven cause she got a lot of experience no no need you just admin <malay>macam</malay> registration <malay>orang nak masuk</malay>
register order nothing nothing about law cause it's just admin work like the you know
those work that people don't want to do <malay>macam</malay> filing and stuff
ya
yup
ya but nevermind you can just now like gain experience then you can go for senior admin ya correct
then people ya
ya I mean is very tough [ah]
what
<malay>tua</malay>
okay new doctor is easy to handle because they don't do anything [what] you can like okay doctor okay doctor
why
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
okay but then okay [lah] working with new doctors they tend to depend on you which is better
<malay>pasal</malay> [sia]
whose fault is that is your fault [what] it's the doctor's [what] [oh] X-ray [oh]
I mean then you talk to the head X-ray department [lah]
so ya
I haven't send in my petition but I already got the form I mean I still have time
I have still have time to march [ah] to think about it to I mean to go bank also to <malay>minta</malay> loan study loon and stuff
I haven't go buy thing during my holidays my next holiday is december then I can go banks but bank now the loan rate is very low because of their bad economy so these is good and a bad thing [ah]
now is like I'm like [ah] whatever just go [lor] because even if I go now there's no job maritime job for me
of course right now I think I'm like
whatever like just do it no because I just
like a news so <malay>macam</malay> like my previous intern might cause I'm still keeping contact them one of the managers <malay>kena buang</malay> [sia]
retrenched <malay>macam</malay> because the economy was busted [sia]
but ya because <malay>aku</malay> like from a project I've been working with him so he's the one who actually ya guide me but now they retrench him <malay>macam</malay> !wah!
ya that's life ya that's why ya correct correct
nothing is certain [sia] now like
(mm) correct
alright
ya I'm not ready to be no adulthood [lah] so I think I should study one more year
master
if because master in is also one year usually master takes like a lot of years like maybe three years if I'm not wrong I'm not sure
while uni in singapore is four years
(um) degree first their master then PhD uni is degree
then they way to continue [ah] if you got the money
[ah] if I got the money I guess or maybe I will work first and then I take my master part time
until PhD I don't know if
there's a will there's a way <malay>betul</malay>
so ya [lah] so I'm after my career now so
cause there's nothing is certain [lah]
[ah] ya correct so
ya [lah]
ya like ya
correct
but !hais! such as life
(mm)
september then come back august I think

then you will visit me [what] there
because I'll be having my own room
so it's like my friend one room me me one room so you can just sleep over I don't care like I mean the landlord won't know
also think if <malay>tak bising</malay> [ah]
I mean if you're going with your boyfriend then he can sleep in the living room
ya he can stay in the living room but you guys come during my term break [ah] I don't know
