okay
okay so I she's going away we're going to get her a present [ah] and ya I think you're right the frames are too heavy we're not going to give those but how I don't want it to be like <malay>macam buku yang</malay> just print out like that <malay>biarkan gitu</malay> then it's just gonna sit in a cupboard forever I feel like it will be cool if it was something that she
can see everyday you know especially in that country maybe lots of pictures of us in the sunshine <malay>macam</malay> while she freezing her butt off there
ya okay okay got it
yes yes yes yes ya ya ya so it's not just (err) (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> what we going to make
(err) phone phone case it can be anything it can be a mug it can be a t-shirt <malay>boleh apa-apa</malay> [kan]
yup
but it's also the whole heavy thing [lah] once again to have to drag in her luggage or or I don't know couldn't tweet
(hmm) send it to her
but no you want a gift that can on that day itself be looked at right okay okay fine ya ya then I think ya we can find some small light items <malay>nak buat dia punya</malay> print [ah] so we're gotta select a bunch of pictures of what we like right and then
figure out what are the things I'm sure they have online presence <malay>mesti ada kalau kau pergi dia punya</malay> website <malay>dia cakap</malay> that these are the things you can bring on or something [ah] or if not actually there are a lot of websites that do that so <malay>macam</malay> vista print
you name it [lah] they will print it on something and it's digital printing which means you don't need a like must order minimum hundred or what can even give her of our faces to wear on which day today I feel like a #sham# day
today ya ya correct correct
ya ya ya ya ya and when she lonely she can talk to the picture
[ah] guys I need some advice
ya ya okay
so ya I think I think vista print all this website got [ah] and I think this that would be the same website that also makes a photo book
cause they are that kind of digital printers so they do everything so okay so let's pick out a bunch of pictures <malay>kita pilih mana yang kita suka</malay> then that becomes the photo book and then we pick out a few others ya okay can [ah] I guess that is the plan
you know what I do after awhile I throw it out I don't like clutter
[eh] I've had to throw all sorts of things in my life in order to like fit it into this house and also when I went overseas to work
<malay>aku tak ada tak ada bilik tau bilik aku</malay> is my sister you know so cause I was living elsewhere so my things were always a minimum [ah] and then both times when I go government staycation also
again I lost a lot of things so my whole life has been a series of losing shit [lah] moving and <malay>macam</malay> just all over the place so when it meant that when I moved into this house I just didn't have
much I don't have pictures of people from secondary school all bird fly high hard to catch friends like you hard to forget I don't I I never bothered to keep those things I feel like (um) if you want me you know where to find me [ah] then we can hang out
[ah] I don't I don't know ya so anyway photo book wasn't the best thing [lah] but I thought some pictures or or the other thing is we give her a bunch of pictures that are nicely printed and then we order the thing online say buy from amazon but it to be delivered to where she is [ah]
[ah]
why can't it not be us <malay>apa</malay> [jer] okay so how about we make a poster [ah] of us
like super glam shit and then we like then can pin the poster have like cool headline or what then write some funny copyrighting for venue and
date you know that kind of thing like date that when
when forever in your heart you know sort of vibes [ah] ya ya it's ultimate narcissism for a group that is so in love with ourselves <malay>gitu</malay>
ya ya I know I know I know ya ya ya ya ya and I think actually that's what she prefers too but I suspect when she she said that time that cause she wasn't even sure whether this is happening like whether they're gonna be able to secure the mortgage get the place there and be able to you know actually move [lah]
but then I suspect once it's confirmed there got #iskandar# is settled there is a flight date ticket
confirm she want to meet everybody and his brother so I suspect there will be a bigger thing
I don't know how big is big (err) when where how we're going to do it in groups of five as per the government guidelines
but
but for us I think I don't know is it just come over here and do our usual or is it want to have like a a lovely dinner outside somewhere
okay ya I'd like that
fuck so all these by the end of the month okay
what is the deal <malay>dia</malay> secretive <malay>gila</malay> [ah] [sia] <malay>aku tak tahu dia sekarang</malay> at which point you know are their tickets booked is that is what is happening over there you know
ya I'm ya ya ya and she has this fear of
sharing about it like that time I I thought her her attitude was interesting like she was <malay>dia cakap</malay> that (um)
she don't want to talk about it to people cause she's afraid to like jinx it <malay>gitu</malay> and then she would also feel very embarrassed if she was supposed to leave on a certain date and then didn't then people will like <malay>macam</malay>
[eh] #nisa# why you never leave [eh] <malay>kau apa</malay> [sia] I'm like can't imagine who the who the hell would actually do that to her
to do with the two of them yes yes
<malay>tak aku rasa</malay> it is that ya ya ya when it comes to him you're right they got some secretive things <malay>aku aku rasa</malay> that <malay>dia cakap dengan nisa</malay> that these things <malay>kau tak payah</malay> share <malay>dengan kau punya</malay> friends I think so too I think that is that sort of understanding between them which
ya [lah] it's their partners [lah] we should respect that [ah] but I just thought there was some fear there you know of people mocking her and I'm like (um) you a bit too old to have this fear <malay>tapi dia kadang-kadang</malay> got got that kind of little streaks of like
what are people thinking of me
yes she has
ya ya she's definitely discovered
how to be her own person [ah] like she will stand up to people and she will I liked it when I see her at parties and she very mother hen with all the younger ones I think it allows her to make a lot of friends cause she goes in like a <malay>kakak kakak</malay> you know she goes in like
[ah] <malay>kau dah</malay> okay <malay>tak</malay> and then <malay>aku boleh cakap dengan kau gini gini gitu gitu</malay> like like she's just how are you <malay>macam mana sekarang sekolah gitu gini</malay> you know and ya
they flocked to her [ah] all the little malay girls on the floor the little mod girls
they love her
ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya
<malay>ni semua kau orang</malay>
[ah] [ah] [ah]
cause that was the day that you found out I see okay got it
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
ya ya ya ya
fuck [lah] she's such an integral part of the group I'm gonna miss her like hell man
I've had it with you all yup ya ya ya ya ya ya
ya I I don't understand what it could take <malay>macam</malay> [ah] ya unless somebody changes drastically and that could happened sometimes somebody becomes bitter or alcoholic you get what I mean [ah] then you become a bit wonky [ah]
[ah] my understanding is that the the guy was playing the both of them and then sarah beef
with you was that you were talking about it to both sides
ya both both both to #tini# okay got it okay so she felt like somehow you <malay>macam</malay> take #tini#
okay
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
ya ya ya ya
so all this was happening like at the same time while he's flirting with sarah he also like cuddling up with #tini# what the hell man
ya ya ya ya ya
together <malay>apa kau orang semua sama-sama tu</malay> [ah]
yup
!alamak!
so <malay>abeh</malay> at that point <malay>kau tak cakap apa-apa dengan dia</malay>
<malay>abeh kau tak terasa nak cakap apa-apa dengan dia</malay> cause <malay>kau dah tahu</malay> [kan] [ah]
[ah] <malay>dengan tini</malay>
(uh huh)
wait this was the day we went to eat pizza
fish I didn't know the pizza had such undertones so when you brought up pizza thing I thought you had something to do with she coming but not feeling like eating but then is it she no need to contribute to the bill you know I thought it was that sort of like bill and who pays what drama fuck okay okay okay
yes
yup
yup
ya
so did sarah know that jas was doing this with #tini#
she didn't know either okay got it
<malay>siapa</malay> jas <malay>dengan tini asal</malay> [eh] <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
[ah]
ya ya ya ya ya ya
so what was #tini# first reaction then when you said she went bitch mode
<malay>dia salahkan siapa</malay>
okay
[ah]
ya ya ya ya ya okay
so <malay>hari tu bila kita dah sampai dekat</malay> pizza cause again I'm lost in my own world did they have a chat outside <malay>dia orang berbual</malay>
then she come down for what
ya ya ya ya ya ya unless you're coming to eat with us then okay [lah] it's clear <malay>tapi kau</malay>
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
right
[ah] [ah] [ah]
okay
that's right
ya okay got it
yup
ya ya ya
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] like like like you like to
ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya yup
that is not nice explain
like a party girl no
ya okay okay okay ya ya ya nobody really likes that anyway ya ya ya yup ya ya ya I understand <malay>tahu</malay>
yup
ya that's the you cannot correct correct you can't mould other people's perceptions [lah] ya ya ya
<malay>jadi kau bila kau berbual dengan</malay> sarah <malay>kau adalah</malay> explain <malay>dengan dia</malay> that the reason why that even came up in the first place was <malay>pasal kau nak</malay> understand make #tini# understand that she's being played [ah]
[ah] that jas is playing that jas correct correct cause #tini# was like totally completely oblivious to it right she didn't know ya she didn't know sarah didn't know as well but #tini# felt like the person who was
losing her heart over him [ah] it sounds like it like like #tini# really was quite set on it being rather serious
ya
ya ya ya ya ya so it's a it's a big deal for and she must have been really hurt
(mm)
when there are friendly things you don't reciprocate ya
(mm)
did did we post that picture in the group chat with <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> cake <malay>nama dia tu</malay> [ah] K K
ya ya ya ya I remember that
ya
okay
<malay>tahu tahu tahu</malay> ya ya ya ya <malay>kau percayalah</malay> ya I know I know I know I know I know I know ya
just even indulge in gossip you get what I mean ya ya I know you don't do that either
[ah] correct correct it's new information for someone you know as opposed to <malay>macam mengeluh</malay> over somebody usual pattern <malay>tu lain</malay>
okay
ya <malay>tak tahu</malay> [seh] <malay>cerita cerita ni semuanya</malay>
ya ya ya ya ya
ya
okay
yes
ya ya ya ya you you have no control over this [lah] ya
yup
so probably just a bit more careful [lah] when how she speaks [lah]
yup yup yup yup yup yup
ya <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
I mean one wishes it never happen in the first place but friendships will go up and down [lah] it's like that [lah] sometimes there are just little areas you don't go to finish ya ya I think it's it's it
it's the sort of thing that you think about when you are thinking about how valuable is this person to me what sort of a friend it is it's not just the happy moments that you will think about but it's also about the bad moments that you guys were able to patch up together and that I think really adds to the value of the friendship you know the amount of work you put into it
ya
yup
correct obviously there's a lot of censorship going on yes ya
friction
yup
yup
yup yup yup yup it's how you then deal with it together that matters
ya
ya ya ya
yes #nisa# likes to set boundaries you know I like I like I've learnt a lot about setting boundaries from how #nisa# does it I'm afraid I'm not comfortable with this so I'm not going to do it ya and and it's
it it comes as a surprise to people that I use it on I don't know if it's cause maybe when I say it I don't see it as nicely or sweetly as #nisa# but I've noticed a lot of people like eyebrows raised when I draw this kind of boundaries
then I also wonder [oh] is it because we just don't say these things <malay>kita mana nak belajar pasal</malay> boundary and learn how to do it
I I really think that's missing [ah] in schools [ah] how to politely draw line you know
[ah] [ah] correct <malay>aku rasa macam</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kami datang nak petik bunga di taman awak</malay>
ya it's the <malay>bahasa berbunga</malay> and the gentleness of the language overall [lah] ya ya ya makes it hard
[ah] [ah] correct and it can be done very politely no one's trying to hurt your feelings here you know
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
there was definitely silence after I said that like it hung in the room for awhile
three seconds then (err) then continue [lah] but I was
truly unapologetic cause it was too late at night and my brain was just ya not having it like I don't even have the capacity to have it even if I wanted to you know I don't have the capacity sorry it's too late
I bet you would have <malay>kau mesti ketawa macam perempuan gila</malay> in the corner and make it a lot worse than it is <malay>nanti dia fikir aku betul-betul</malay> #suan# <malay>dia</malay>
confirm <malay>tau kau punya</malay> sense of humour <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> like no <malay>janganlah</malay>
[ah] so <malay>azmi tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>hari ini kau datang sini buat ni</malay> [ah] <malay>kau cakap dengan dia</malay>
(err)
[oh] okay okay okay
[oh] okay so there is a possibility he might come is it [oh] okay cool
[ah] [eh] I can't talk now I'm sorry I'm doing the recording [ah]
[oh] [oh] ya dude we were just talking about you
<malay>kita tengah</malay> we are currently in about let me see twenty seven minutes we are about halfway through [ah] #azmi# can you entertain yourself
or maybe he has left okay
ya I did say no background noise but that was just a really quick one <malay>kami minta maaf iya</malay>
okay so I don't know do you want like tackle the questions that we had okay we are halfway through so it's not too bad (um) but ya
it's taking a bit longer than expected cause I think it's cause the antibiotics are making my mouth like damn dry so next time I do this [sia] I need water need what what
god I hate this medication so much
!huh! natural things
no cause it's it it's means it put in effort if somebody just walks up to me and give it to me now I will gladly drink it I will so gladly drink it I just can't be asked even get up go to the toilet cause it hurts so I'm not gonna go and no I don't think so
I don't think so
[ah] or maybe I do I don't know I have to go in and check that might be some ground ginger from my mum she likes this she gives me ground ginger so I could mix it with some hot water and and something okay I'll go look at it after this actually I'm getting damn hungry so after this I do <malay>aku nak pergi makan</malay>
<malay>aku nak makan mak aku punya</malay> #briyani# <malay>tak kisah pergi mampus dengan perut aku</malay> and come and taste some a bit <malay>sedap makan dia dengan</malay> curry all these
<malay>mak aku masak</malay> two days ago national day feasts
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tu pun ada</malay> I didn't even know we had this tradition <malay>tapi tak pasal-pasal</malay> [ah] <malay>hari ni</malay> national day <malay>kita ada</malay> #briyani# <malay>abeh aku</malay> is not not having it so that day I was out at brunch then after brunch went over to to #aman# friends place right so I was
did not reply to message until next day five o'clock like hello ya hi no not today I'm not coming today I got I got migraine
ya do you know there was my national day was so non eventful on my way to brunch which I had with a friend <malay>dekat</malay> at <malay>kat</malay> upper thomson <malay>aku</malay> pass by <malay>dekat</malay> road <malay>aku nampak banyak-banyak orang semua diri dekat luar</malay> road
then <malay>aku</malay> thought they were going somewhere but no cause it's this mobile columns that's moving right so that's why I did not know about this mobile columns at all so I was like why are they just standing there <malay>kalau kau nak pergi</malay> somewhere <malay>jalan</malay> [ah] <malay>asal diri sana panas terik tu hari tu aku dengar</malay> forty one degrees
!huh! I don't know why the soldiers didn't cook in the tank [sia]
like steamboat [ah] [oh] inside the tank got aircon
singapore
as long as I got my aircon
okay ya so I saw all that but then I think later on in the day I saw one facebook video of like tank it was quite surreal the tank go past but the the guy whose job it is to kill people with this tank is just waving very happily I'm like !wow! this isn't what I'm paying my soldiers for you know who ask you to wave
<malay>apa ni</malay> you're supposed to kill people that's what the war machine is for right but [ah] no but apart from that I had no idea it was national day I didn't even hear fireworks can you see from here
[ah] okay but can't see it [ah]
ya ya ya ya ya
[oh] that's cool
I was working that night (mm) (mm)
<malay>jadi sekarang macam mana kau nak</malay> try tackle one of the questions
(err)
ya I don't know why cause ya it was interesting it was just so uneventful
(err) if you could
[oh] god I completely forgot all the questions I don't know what they want
memorable meal
you know I can't even think of one
okay maybe got one where my boss brings us to this like restaurant in #bali# it's called mosaic and it was super fucking posh and not just that but it was it took indonesian
folklore and <malay>petua-petua kesihatan</malay> you get what I mean for like different [ah] different food items whether it's different types of herbs different types of leaves different types of yams whatever from indonesia
and then wove it all into a menu that was that told a story [ah] from start to end and then at each point for each dish
the waiter comes out and the presentation is beautiful the way he like opens up the <malay>kau tahu macam bunga-bunga apa tu</malay> [eh] <malay>bunga ulam</malay> [eh] or is it the <malay>bunga-bunga macam</malay>
look like banana flower kind of vibe [ah] or top ginger you know that kind where you sort of peel it open [kan] [ah] <malay>lepas tu</malay> the way <malay>yang dia orang</malay> serve and like plate the thing and then telling the explanation of what it's for and how do people use it are there any stories associated with it I thought that was a really memorable meal cause everything that you taste suddenly had a lot of significance and I'm sure we all had meals like that and I think whenever somebody plans meal [kan]
that's such a great way to make it like another dimension you know to add on that's cool
off the top of your head
okay
[ah] <malay>tu</malay>
[oh]
[ah]
<malay>kau</malay>
[ah] [ah] [ah] [oh] my god then you just take the whole thing [ah] [ah] [ah]

yup
and !wah!
yes it's the moments [ah] saffron [ah] saffron
[ah] [ah] [ah]
ya ya ya
<malay>bila larut malam punya</malay> vibes [ah]
I can imagine
ya ya ya actually I don't even know about I feel like I've got <malay>aku pernah dengar nama dia</malay> saffron <malay>tapi aku tak tahu kat mana dia kat</malay> #bugis#
where is it #tampines# [ah] okay okay okay ya [lah] maybe that's why <malay>aku tak</malay> travel out [lah]
I have a direct bus to #tampines# here not even at the interchange you know
<malay>sini lorong lorong tu aku tak tahu apa pasal</malay>
one two seven
it's very random and it goes straight to tampines I don't even know why normally the road <malay>ni kira ada</malay> feeder bus [jer] <malay>biasanya tapi sekarang ada</malay> one two seven <malay>apa benda</malay>
could be yup
and I've been seeing a lot more of this large bright green buses <malay>punya</malay> bus <malay>baru punya</malay> [ah] [ah] <malay>dia orang macam tak tahu ni</malay> bus <malay>baru ke</malay> service <malay>baru</malay> but
[ah] new buses [lah] right that they bought ya ya ya ya so from <malay>tadi yang aku faham</malay> bus <malay>ni kalau kalau kalau kau ambil</malay> bus <malay>ni dia terus pergi</malay> highway
do not pass do not collect two hundred dollars <malay>dia terus pergi</malay> highway <malay>lepas tu kau</malay> end up in #tampines# in <malay>berapa</malay> minute okay [lah] not minute [lah] but <malay>iya</malay> [lah] you get the idea ya ya very short [ah]
ya ya ya
#tampines# ya got
but they take awhile they all take awhile they will go and explore <malay>kat mana kita pergi tengok-tengok</malay> (err) #geylang# <malay>mari</malay> [lah] <malay>kita boleh tengok</malay> #katong#
(mm) #katong# ya there's a lot of [ah] detours [ah] <malay>tak faham</malay> [seh]
[ah] ask bird park <malay>pun</malay> bird park <malay>aku sakit hati aku ambil</malay> bus <malay>pergi sana</malay> one and half hour [sia]
<malay>pantat kering</malay> [ah] that I basically <malay>aku</malay> need to <malay>sampai</malay> #boon lay#
so that's the end station in mind
[ah] bird park <malay>kau kau cakap apa</malay> zoo [eh]
ya zoo is #ang mo kio# [lah] ya ya ya
ya that used to be my commute !wah! and another way that I used to commute was how [ah] [oh] no this one is when I go home time I take from the zoo but then I stop somewhere along thomson road upper thomson there then I take a bus down I walk there I come down to braddell braddell view then I walk home [ah]
it was a nice walk home
<malay>dia orang masih tak</malay> email <malay>aku</malay> [sia] after <malay>aku hantar</malay> resume <malay>aku</malay> about that was I think on the seventh
today is
<malay>dia dia cakap</malay> they didn't basically <malay>dia macam</malay> portal <malay>gitu kau</malay> upload upload resume <malay>apa benda</malay> then at the end it just had a your resume has been successfully submitted [ah] [ah] <malay>kau tunggu</malay> three weeks
to get a response so I guess it hasn't been three weeks but I'm also a bit sad
then the meantime there are other things like my I have a friend who call me and it's basically what this is is a startup <malay>habis</malay> startup <malay>ni dia macam kumpul</malay> together all the plumbers electricians sort of thing okay then you would it works like a uber where you would find a service and book it and then <malay>abeh kau kau boleh tengok dia punya</malay> (err) (err) route to you [ah] <malay>macam macam macam</malay> grab delivery [ah] <malay>boleh nampak dia punya</malay> driver on the way to you how long more it will take blah blah blah
and then [ah] they need somebody to help coordinate this things in the back end and also (err) check out on the services that is provided <malay>tanya</malay> [lah] <malay>dengan orang tu</malay> okay okay <malay>tak dia orang buat ada apa-apa rosak ada apa-apa</malay> okay complain <malay>ke apa benda</malay> (um)
so that's that the job seems rather interesting <malay>tapi</malay> I'm I'm a little concerned about it on a couple of levels [ah] firstly <malay>dia</malay> startup <malay>abeh baru</malay> start <malay>apa apa cerita dia sebenarnya</malay> you know like what is the process and is it <malay>kau orang ada macam</malay> any or template in place or actually <malay>kau orang tengah cari orang untuk</malay> start the whole thing up you know from scratch properly cause if that's the case ya okay I I also don't have problem with that but I would need to make sure that I'm paid
accordingly [lah] cause I will be putting in a lot more work (um) then the other concern is also when I went online when I tried to look for like you know services like this [kan]
there are already a lot of websites where you can even like directories and you can <malay>kau boleh</malay> filter down <malay>tau kau tinggal kat mana orang ni kat mana</malay> [ah] that kind of thing it's not something new [ah] this
pulling together of different house jobs you know plumbing [ah] carpentry little bit that sort of thing it really exists a lot <malay>jadi aku macam</malay> (err) <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
<malay>nak</malay> try <malay>ke tak</malay>
<malay>abeh</malay> in the meantime <malay>ada benda macam gini</malay> okay <malay>aku</malay> happy <malay>nak buat</malay> I don't know why [sia] I don't know [ah] I'm feeling <malay>macam</malay> don't want to work and then also the fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic and there's all this weirdness and more jobs to be lost and the economy is going to shit
<malay>lagi aku rasa macam</malay>
I want to lie in bed and watch
it's not a way of avoiding the world it's just <malay>aku</malay> don't feel like dealing with you all right now it's too much crap I don't feel like it I'm not having it
so I guess not having it is something we've been saying recently [ah] not having it
I I haven't heard it you started using it
not having it
no mood [ah]
then it doesn't help that my stupid boils keep happening
and I'm so incapacitated
okay so that was memorable meal
that took awhile
okay cool
ya also I provided an update about my current job hunt tight situation
[oh] (um)
I I don't remember one
[oh] if people didn't have to work what would they do right
okay so this is
[ah] actually it is I like this things
<malay>jadi kalau kita tak payah kerja hari-hari buat apa</malay>
leave [ah] I learn this new word vibing I'm just vibing man so <malay>kira macam tangkap</malay> [jer] [ah] vibing so I vibe [ah]

yup yup yup yup
doing this sort of things
ya ya I would get into something quite obsessively I think you know like just explore or pursue or an interest <malay>sampai</malay>
[ah] correct correct maybe finally have a ant farm
don't know [leh] I mean if if I feel like maybe not sure or what I got questions then maybe I can call ryan

I I went to this activist event [ah] some time ago two years ago I think it's called <malay>apa itu</malay> activist so it was mainly organized by AWARE and a lot of other like MARUAH all this [ah] different activists and groups here in singapore then one of it had breakup session so then you can pick
which room you want to go to participate in which session [ah] so I went to this one particular room where <malay>dia orang macam mana</malay> [tau] <malay>macam lebih kurang tiga puluh orang tiga puluh orang</malay> sit in a circle <malay>berdiri</malay> in a circle
and then <malay>berdiri</malay> in a circle <malay>lepas tu</malay> the person <malay>yang</malay> moderator <malay>diri dekat tengah dia cakap</malay> okay if you have these things that I'm about to say you step back
if you don't if you never had these things then you step forward so they started asking [ah] <malay>kau ada</malay> maid <malay>tak kau pernah ada</malay> maid <malay>rumah kau abeh kalau kau ada kau</malay> step back
so <malay>abeh</malay> ask more questions [ah] <malay>macam kau pernah ada rumah</malay> family <malay>kau ada kereta tak kau orang pernah pergi</malay> holiday <malay>kau pernah rasa macam</malay> snow basically questions about privilege [ah] then at the end of the thirty forty questions that he asked
<malay>kau boleh nampak</malay> [ah] <malay>siapa yang kat tengah siapa yang kat belakang sikit abeh yang kat tengah banyak</malay> was a lot of brown people also cause some of the questions that was asked was also <malay>macam</malay> have have anybody made fun of your name
so a lot of brown people step forward [lah] as supposed to chinese people little things like that you know
<malay>abeh aku</malay> found myself right in the middle with two other people
and it didn't occur to me even that I had that I didn't have this privileges
I was a bit confused about being in the middle cause I thought I <malay>ada</malay> pretty good life you know ya we got no maid no car all these <malay>tapi</malay> there's always food on the table I had uniforms I've heard so many other stories of people who had it so much worse right that was interesting but then
that wasn't my point my point was one guy towards the back of the room who obviously grow up with a lot of privileges crying [ah] sobbing like a baby cause that exercise got to him to the point where he just felt like
<malay>dia semua pun ada abeh kenapa orang lain tak boleh ada ni semua kenapa hidup dia orang nak kena sampai macam gini</malay> [seh]
couldn't he just kept crying and crying the group <malay>macam</malay> went around him <malay>abeh sayang sayang dia</malay> and
<malay>betul betul betul aku ada terfikir</malay> [tau] at that moment <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau yang nangis sepatutnya aku yang patut nangis apa</malay> [sia] <malay>kau nangis tapi aku rasa tapi aku rasa kadang-kadang</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] ya ya correct correct there was a sense of that there's definitely a sense of that but then there was also a sense of maybe you need to
like be far removed from the from the situation in order to sympathize with it sometimes when you are too close in the situation <malay>dia macam apa tak kisah</malay> [ah] <malay>buat</malay> [jer] [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> when you are far away you realised actually this person doesn't need to do this you know this person should be able to have other options instead of being forced to towards doing X Y Z so maybe he was in the better position to to understand privilege than we do cause he's
had it right but no [lah] the the it's just the way he cried it it really reminded me of what you were saying about the younger people in who see the world a bit differently but then they don't understand why everything cannot be equal you know whereas for us
I don't know I don't know what it is [ah] about us like you said maybe it's that change over from technology that's change and suddenly from a position of being <malay>macam</malay> a bit #suaku# about the world suddenly we see a lot more we see a lot more riches we also see a lot more pain and poverty
so then maybe that was a shock to our system compared to them who was already born with a world where you cannot expect anything will happen at any time ya maybe for them it's a different way of looking at things I don't know
#sundilah#
[eh] <malay>aku tak suka</malay> [ah] <malay>dia orang punya cerita tak habis-habis tak habis-habis pasal aku dulu</malay> [ah] very very poor [tau] <malay>aku tak ada duit</malay> family <malay>aku tak ada duit</malay>
[ah]
<malay>main</malay> soccer
that was really weird and and tone deaf I thought this this election got a lot of things that were tone deaf [ah] from the side
<malay>macam</malay> are you listening to yourself not bro
[ah] <malay>kau tak ada</malay> script <malay>ke ni sikit-sikit</malay> [ah]
ya ya ya ya ya ya and who's writing this maybe the people writing it are tone deaf in the first place you understand like <malay>aku</malay> can imagine them choosing some like rich fuck
firm that may not have I don't know many people that are representatives I don't know man
[oh] this is the #whampoa# ya but cause <malay>kau orang punya</malay> the other side <malay>siapa</malay> #lim tian#
people's voice [kan]
#lim tian# <malay>sama dengan</malay> randolf [ah]
randolf was volunteering with #lim tian# <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] [ah]
I see I see I see
ya ya ya ya
your vote now
ya I don't think it matters
it's for people who are scared [lah] it does need they need to be told that cause even this election <malay>banyak kali</malay> [sia] <malay>macam</malay> naomi had colleagues my mother had friends who all said your vote is not secret in singapore
this fear is still there [ah] and <malay>aku rasa</malay> the the the likes this fear to be there cause then <malay>senang apa untuk dia orang</malay>
[ah] <malay>kau</malay> try [ah] <malay>nanti aku tak kasih kau</malay> covered walkways <malay>kau nak</malay> covered walkways
but now I see my <malay>apa</malay> I was specially recognised as a top fan
for singapore supporting the government cause of covered walkways
it's a facebook group ya ya ya I was so proud of myself <malay>aku macam</malay> I took a screenshot and send to naomi and say my accomplishment for today everybody we must achieve something
<malay>hidup mesti ada</malay> concept
