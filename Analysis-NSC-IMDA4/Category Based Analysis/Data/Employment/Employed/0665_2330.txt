have you watched the the the the what the marriage
[ah] the world of the marriage it's on Netflix now
<malay>kenapa</malay>
so you watched the first episode
okay (um) for my this is my opinion [lah] [kan]
the first few episodes was good
then after a while [kan] <malay>dia</malay> (err)
it got to a point that <malay>dia macam</malay> super nonsense
the the wife is psycho [kan]
no but I (um) the the the first wife I don't know [ah] like <malay>apa</malay> motive <malay>dia buat macam gitu semua</malay> [kan]
<malay>dia nak apa</malay> revenge
yes because
so <malay>dia</malay> don't love the husband anymore
so <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>nak</malay> revenge only
<malay>dia apa</malay>
I don't know that's where I'm confused about like whether <malay>dia</malay> fall in love with the colleague or
did did they did she even fall in love
[oh]
<malay>habis</malay> (um) so the guy love her or don't love her the guy like her or don't like her
then why the guy still <malay>jumpa</malay> with the shermaine and all
the the psychiatrist the psychiatric or psychiatrist guy doctor the guy
<malay>dia</malay> [kan] <malay>jumpa</malay> with the
the #han so hee# <malay>punya bapa</malay>
ya they he like secretly meet up behind the
the the the lead actress the wife the first wife behind her back
they meet and then after that (err) <malay>macam</malay> they the the guy the new guy share information with
<malay>ni</malay> wife <malay>punya bapa</malay>
ya
the show [kan]
the show is good you know the first few episodes was so good you know that I really want to watch I really want to keep watching and watching [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> after awhile
like merepek apa</malay>
sixteen I think
ya
I think because [kan] the first five episodes the first few episodes [kan] that they had such a good response
and then they kind of felt pressured to do better so people
[oh] ya they follow the standards [eh]
I know but then why the lock
ya I locked I locked already
no it's not about the episodes it's about the way they run the show like the was so good ya the story line was so good <malay>tapi</malay> after awhile it's just so <malay>merepek</malay>
the writer failed big time
ya I know we watched it like so many times
ya
we watched that so many times and I still cry <malay>tu</malay> so <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm watching <malay>cerita</malay> reply nineteen ninety eight have you watched that
(um) [ah] there's <malay>dia ada</malay> reply nineteen ninety four reply nineteen ninety seven and reply nineteen ninety [eh] nineteen eighty eight

(mm)
for what
(mmhmm)
you no you why you don't let him [ah] <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] give you referral to national skincare
it's like
(uh) it's not a severe case sorry cause yours only is on here only <malay>kat sini macam</malay> still have nothing
what is comedonal I only know komodo dragon
[oh] then you go
(mm) you can go there [lah] because my sister-in-law #kamifie# [kan] <malay>dia dulu ada</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like yours [ah] acne like that [kan]
but at the cheek you know like cheek only I I don't know I forgot but you know the <malay>macam termasuk termasuk punya</malay>
I think so but it's <malay>termasuk</malay> you know after after it cured right it
ya like <malay>termasuk sikit</malay> [jer] then dekat atas</malay> nothing you know nose nothing just the cheek you know
so she went to some aesthetic clinic and then (err) she paid like few thousand she keep <malay>macam dia orang</malay> keep inject here inject there but
the problem still persists
so after that she said <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] let's do it [lah] just go national skin centre and then within three months [kan] the skin really clear up you know
but the first two weeks [kan] <malay>dia punya</malay> skin really flared up <malay>macam teruk gila macam</malay> I think the medicine they use
release all for the first two weeks [kan] <malay>macam teruk gila</malay> you know she looks so swollen but
after that right now her skin super flawless
so cheap
I think the consultation fee is expensive but the medicine is cheap
no I don't know but you know <malay>kalau</malay> if I have that problem right I can actually help you because I can
my expenses can be claimed
<malay>tapi</malay> I have there <malay>tengok ni macam</malay>
ya [lah] I know because I don't clean my face I don't use facial wash at all
ya I know
I think I want to buy Cetaphil and I want to buy <malay>apa</malay> (um) <malay>yang</malay> scrub scrub <malay>juga tu</malay>
exfoliator or something but I cannot find anything
I think my skin cannot <malay>kena</malay> Cosrx [eh]
when you know they Cosrx they sell this acne pimple patch [kan]
I usually buy this from another brand and that thing works so good like it can work within few hours then my pimple will be gone [tau]
<malay>tapi</malay> Cosrx I need to use for a few days <malay>baru</malay> that pimple will just go away
I want to
can you can I see
[oh] ya cystic <malay>habis</malay> that [one] see
this [one] cannot
poke also
ya that's how cystic acne works I used to have a lot here
(uh)
before my marriage [kan] my face quite <malay>kotor</malay> also
then you know
no no no no the people say people say after <malay>beranak</malay> then like after you give birth
the <malay>darah</malay>
the head
or you wash blood or you <malay>bekam bekam</malay> right
[a'ah]
do cupping
but you know what when I had the cystic acne [kan] <malay>dulu</malay>
before <malay>kahwin</malay> [kan]
when I had cystic acne I won't use makeup on top of that
never I will cover using pimple sticker
no even use I
no even if I don't use makeup I will cover it until <malay>dia jatuh</malay>

horrible
one of
one of
[oh] they say [kan] they say it's not because of <malay>apa</malay>
(um) it's not
it's not <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>yang pakai</malay> makeup it's about
you how you wash your face
[oh] ya ya
you you use it <malay>sampai habis</malay> [eh]

I use I do a lot of things back then <malay>macam</malay> one of those
plaster [kan] <malay>macam gini</malay> [kan] then in the middle is the white colour [kan] I will cut like <malay>macam</malay>
four become <malay>kecil</malay> and then the part then the <malay>putih</malay> there on the side <malay>itu</malay> then I will cut like four
