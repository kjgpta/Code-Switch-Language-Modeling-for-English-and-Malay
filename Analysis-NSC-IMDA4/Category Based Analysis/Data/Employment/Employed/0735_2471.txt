<malay>banyak</malay> commitment
okay [ah] <malay>jom kita tengok</malay>
<malay>soalan</malay>
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
my most memorable meal
I don't have
(hmm) <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>pada</malay> I <malay>semua makanan sedap</malay> so <malay>semua</malay> memorable
(um) <malay>kalau satu</malay> [eh]
[oh]
sometimes I still think about the #bunny chow#
right
ya I know like legit
<malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay>
<malay>terduduk</malay> right or like if I <malay>makan</malay> curry cause I <malay>tak suka sangat</malay> [tau] <malay>makan</malay> curry right so <malay>kalau makan</malay> curry right then confirm sometimes I will think about the #bunny chow# [ah] <malay>macam mengidam</malay>
so ya we had the #bunny chow# in
south africa cape town
and it is just
basically curry <malay>dalam roti satu bantal roti sebantal roti</malay>
and then curry <malay>kat dalam</malay>
and that was great
why was it great [ah] I it was butter chicken it wasn't curry
[oh]
(mm)
poof
ya I know I cause like <malay>kita</malay> order <malay>kita nampak gambar tu</malay> that's why <malay>kita</malay> order [kan]
ya
so <malay>tapi macam</malay> I think <malay>yang kenapa</malay> like
is memorable right I think it's like the
<malay>tempat</malay> the <malay>tempat</malay> itself
like <malay>orang-orang dia semua macam</malay>
chill right like <malay>dorang nampak kita macam kawan baik padahal tak pernah jumpa</malay> and then I think cause also not a lot of people cause it wasn't a meal time
ya and the area we were at was like
<malay>tempat orang</malay> tourist [kan]
<malay>terus tak ada orang</malay> then <malay>kita</malay> [jer]
and I think it was also cause like maybe we were hungry
so that explains why
when when we are hungry everything tastes great and
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
[oh] ya the customer ya
(err) I did we eat at another place after that I was I'm pretty sure
ya
food adventure day so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kita makan tu lepas tu kita gi makan</malay> was it a burger
I try to remember
ya
cause also we had no money but <malay>kita nak makan banyak</malay>
ya <malay>nak kena agak-agak</malay>
<malay>agak-agak</malay> [lah]
the burger right
[oh] <malay>aku ingat</malay> [seh] <malay>aku ingat</malay> McDonald's
perbezaan dia memang</malay>
<malay>apa makna tu</malay>
what did you order from McDonald's I can't remember
yet
that was still much better no I think
I remember the McDonald's <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>aku saja</malay> [jer] <malay>keluarkan</malay> chili packet (um)
cause we were given only [ah] ketchup packet at the particular McDonald's and clearly cause number one
malay number two
prefers spicy stuff
everything they had was like just not
not good enough okay
ya no McSpicy no nothing so of course we'll be like okay fine we try the local McDonald's but
ya so I took out the chili packet
next to the tomato ketchup packet then I'm pretty sure they were like someone was like where did this chili packet come from
just another day
I feel like we finish the chili packet on that one day right
<malay>pada</malay>
everything we wanted we wanted chili chili
I think like we ate too much but
[oh]
(mmhmm)
I <malay>ada gambar</malay> I think
it was basically
<malay>satu benda tu macam</malay> [ah] <malay>roti dalam dia daging</malay>
right
it's like #roti# #prata# <malay>dalam gulung gulung daging</malay>
<malay>kari daging</malay> or something like that is it
ya we ate #samosa#
[oh] <malay>ada nasi</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> #nasi briyani# <malay>tapi tu tengah tengah dia</malay> cheese [eh] <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
[kan]
cheese <malay>dengan daging</malay> [ah]
[kan] something like that
I think I I remember I took a photo
we went there twenty seventeen
three years
so I think there was
[ah] <malay>tu nasi</malay>
<malay>daging dengan</malay> cheese <malay>ke</malay> something [lah] <malay>putih</malay> there right it was a
it was the thing
ya
ya then cause <malay>melayu dorang bukan macam melayu kita</malay> [ah] cause their malay is mainly they came from indonesia ya and then
ya
and cause of the slavery and all that and colonialism so a very different malay food [lah]
(mmhmm)
[oh] I <malay>aku tahu</malay> (err) there's something else <malay>kita cuba</malay> (um) <malay>apa benda tu yang roti</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> [jer] [eh] <malay>roti yang</malay> is also from the malay <malay>apa</malay> the <malay>melayu</malay> the cake malay site no remember we went driving like I think on my birthday or something we went driving in that area
remember then we went to the shady okay not shady I'm so sorry but like the well-to-do neighbourhood and then we drove next to the train
then after you were like #nata# got train then I want to look but I'm driving
and then got the people waving from the train and then you were like #nata# look at there but I was driving
so that no it wasn't #bo-kaap# it was like a different side of cape town and then we drove there specifically for that particular <malay>roti</malay>
what was the <malay>roti</malay> called
okay so the <malay>roti</malay> is like [ah] <malay>roti perancis panjang gitu</malay> [kan] and then after that <malay>dia potong setengah lepas tu dia taruk macam</malay> you <malay>nak taruk daging ke nak taruk ayam</malay>
no it's not is it a #pani#
ya but it's like a very very long <malay>roti perancis</malay> right
and then and then they tell us you wanna you want to half or you want the full and then I think then we so stupid we said full
loaded
ya there was fries there was (um) meat there was what cheese
<malay>sayur</malay> right and vegetable
ya then we no we then okay so we had the whole <malay>roti perancis</malay> and then they asked us whether you want the full you know like Subway like foot long or half right and then we were like ya we want full and then so he was okay so you want two
of the full and then we were like ya one one (uh) beef one chicken so we got the full two full of the loaves right
and then we brought back and then we ate
and then we couldn't even finish
and then we
we ate like we continue
ya we can keep for the next day but we have no microwave
and and it was winter
you remember
[a'ah]
[ah] <malay>terus kita nak masuk</malay> [kan] ice box <malay>pun tak berani</malay>
not
[a'ah]
ya
<malay>tu lepas tu tak ada</malay> microwave
so <malay>kita macam</malay>
<malay>nak buat apa ni</malay> [eh] so I remember <malay>satu satu malam kita tinggalkan kat tepi kat atas meja betul tak</malay>
so we had
so like I think for lunch and dinner [tau] we ate lunch and dinner we ate that [one]
half
of course we won't we we spend much money on that
(uh) it was like I think we ate like like for lunch and dinner on that day we ate only half of that <malay>roti perancis betul tak</malay>
and then the next then the next <malay>roti perancis</malay>
the next day for breakfast
[kan]
and then
ya and then like for someone like you also who can eat a lot also even that was like too much don't want to eat
ya cause the even the half right the half of that
front that <malay>roti</malay> we even half it again right so it was like one quarter so we ate the one quarter then the one quarter and another one quarter so it's like four four four meals ya but I think
I remember like I remember like why why this food came about was cause the food was for slaves back then right
ya then like it's just the one meal for that one day
no it's ya <malay>sedap</malay>
like (mm)
then the other day I <malay>tengok</malay> then there's I think someone was also at
cape town and they also [oh] it's called the gatsby
right gatsby ya so ya then the person also eat the gatsby
ya
but then I think like [oh] my gosh
think that was memorable in a fact that we couldn't finish
the freaking <malay>roti perancis</malay>
to be fair they tried to warn us
(err) speaking of anything stupid
that trip
yes
ya I don't know it's like there there's stupid thing was one of the things
(um) was we wanted to go to the hill remember <malay>kita</malay> there was like
<malay>hari kedua</malay> [kan] <malay>kita dah sampai</malay> okay so we <malay>sampai kat</malay> cape town then we already checked in and everything then the next day
so <malay>kita</malay> [lah] <malay>macam ghairah</malay> [kan] <malay>konon banyak tenaga</malay> so <malay>kita orang macam</malay> okay the next day ya
<malay>masih muda</malay> that was how many three years ago only
so like the next day we were like okay even though we're jet-lagged <malay>kita nak pergi</malay> we know <malay>tak nak buang masa kita nak terus</malay> like jump into all the activities right
so <malay>kita pergi</malay>
[ah] we wanted to climb a hill it was called signal hill something like that so we took a Grab there
and then the Grab driver was like very nice very friendly talk to us the entire trip okay this was at five or six in the morning can you imagine like we <malay>lepas</malay> just after we got off and then
ya I remember we were quite sleepy ya and then
ya and then the Grab driver okay so the plan was <malay>kita nak panjat itu</malay> hill and then after that at the top of the hill then we see the sunrise
right it makes so much sense and people say like to go up the hill it takes like you know half an hour at most so <malay>kita macam</malay> okay [ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] settle <malay>juga</malay> [ah] [kan] so the then the Grab driver very nice what was his name [ah] I remember it was something very #doug#
<malay>betul</malay> it's like no #doug# or something #doug# [lah] his name I don't know and then and then ya I remember we made a lot of jokes after that no okay anyway so
so the so we told him that we wanted to climb <malay>nak tengok</malay> sunrise all that and he then he dropped us off at this spot and he said ya a lot of people <malay>panjat kat situ</malay> they start <malay>kat situ</malay> then they <malay>panjat</malay> and then by the time <malay>dorang kat atas nampak</malay> sunrise so <malay>kita macam</malay> [eh] it doesn't look like
(um) the spot but it also seems like the spot cause it it just like the it's just the entrance of a
the hill or whatever and there's like signs that say climbing blah blah blah so <malay>kita</malay> okay [lah] go [jer] so so <malay>kita tak tak pakai benda</malay> climbing <malay>pun kita pakai</malay> jeans [kan] <malay>kita pakai</malay> winter coat (uh) you I remember you were having like the bomber jacket and then we started climbing
<malay>langsung</malay>
<malay>tak bersedia langsung</malay> we just started and then <malay>air pun tak ada</malay> I remember
<malay>botol air kita ada satu</malay> [jer] <malay>botol air</malay> right between us there's <malay>satu botol air</malay>
<malay>kasut biasa</malay> and then <malay>kita ada makanan kita ada aku tahu aku ada bawa gula-gula</malay>
you know Daim [kan] <malay>yang</malay> chocolate <malay>gula-gula</malay> something like that
I think there's like <malay>berapa gula-gula</malay> [jer] and then after that ya <malay>satu botol air</malay> okay so we started climbing then <malay>masih boleh sempat</malay> vlog [tau] <malay>mana</malay> video <malay>tu pun aku tak tahu pergi</malay>
then <malay>kita panjat</malay>
<malay>kita panjat terus dah macam lima belas minit ke dua puluh minit macam masih belum naik</malay> [eh] <malay>belum lagi sampai</malay> [a'ah] so <malay>kita macam kenapa kenapa macam jauh betul ni ingatkan</malay> like all the online say like it's very fast should be okay and then like okay [ah]
[ah] <malay>puncak dia macam jauh</malay> [kan]
I don't know [lah] <malay>kita dah sampai</malay>
go [jer] [ah] <malay>ikut</malay> [jer] <malay>takkan nak</malay> stop
[a'ah] [eh] <malay>tak jauh</malay> [ah]
[ah]
<malay>terus dah dah setengah jam gitu aku ingat kita dua macam dah penat</malay> [kan] <malay>terus ada kat ada macam tempat duduk</malay> [kan] then <malay>ada</malay> bench
then it was like facing the <malay>apa</malay> the town below so <malay>kita macam</malay> !wah! <malay>cantik kita pun duduk</malay> then <malay>kita duduk</malay> then <malay>kita macam penat terus minum air</malay> [ah] then <malay>kita minum air</malay> !wah! <malay>macam</malay> relax [ah] <malay>konon terus minum air</malay>
then by that time also sunrise <malay>pun dah naik terus</malay> [kan] <malay>kita macam</malay> okay don't need see sunrise [ah] but never mind [ah]
ya and then I remember <malay>kita</malay> share <malay>gula-gula</malay>
<malay>apa ni minum air lepas tu dah</malay> okay <malay>dah nak</malay> can continue okay <malay>jom</malay> continue <malay>lagi</malay>
continue <malay>berapa jam</malay> [ah] <malay>dua jam tiga jam dua jam</malay>
<malay>aku rasa dua jam</malay> continue all the way to the top
and then it was almost at the top like I think like ten minutes before we reach the top that we realised that we were not climbing a hill but the actual mountain
and it was like
we should have seen this coming but also why was that man jogging
is it like same concept as #bukit timah# hill
ya and
it was quite high like
[ah] in fact yup it was challenging
and
there was ladders there was ropes and you had to climb the rocks like a big rock
and I remember thinking while we were there I like I kept asking you right like are we sure this is the hill and then we were like [eh]
maybe their hills are like this
and then we reach like almost ten minute maybe five ten minutes before we reach the top
then we realised we can actually use our phones
so we googled
we I think no I think I look at Google map like where the heck are we and then Google map showed that we were on lion's head mountain and then we were like what and then we googled lion's head mountain and then we reached and then by the time we reached the peak already and then we saw the sign lion's head mountain peak six hundred is it metres six hundred or something metres above water
<malay>ya allah bodohnya</malay>
like seriously <malay>siapa panjat</malay> all the way <malay>tak perasan macam</malay> [oh] go [jer]
<malay>permandangan</malay>
ya
ya
and
ya
surreal
like <malay>macam jap jap dah sampai atas gunung</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> like <malay>waktu kita tengah panjat pun macam angin dia terlalu kuat</malay> [kan] then the <malay>angin</malay>
<malay>naik</malay> [kan]
[ah] <malay>macam angin dia tengah tolak kita naik</malay> so I think that's why <malay>kita macam</malay> every time <malay>kita</malay> pass by that part <malay>kita macam cepat-cepat naik</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> go go go go
ya
<malay>angin tiup</malay>
ya I remembered that
that so stupid
ya so turns out the hill was like so why the mountain was called lion's head is cause the lion the mountain the the the head it was actually the <malay>kepala</malay> and then there's signal hill that we wanted to originally to climb was actually the body of this lion
so <malay>kita</malay>
so we entered the wrong entrance [lah] basically the the Grab driver confident thought we wanted to climb the freaking mountain
but the Grab driver didn't see that <malay>kita tak pakai baju</malay> athletic at all [oh] okay <malay>kita pakai baju lepak nak mampus</malay>
and I also think
[oh] I remember after when we were going down [kan] <malay>aleh-aleh ada ramai orang naik betul tak</malay> so <malay>dorang semua tengok kita orang macam kenapa dorang pakai baju macam gini</malay>
hiking stick
<malay>dengan beg sekolah dengan</malay> coat <malay>warna biru aku ingat</malay> [seh] coat <malay>aku biru macam</malay> shiny
your bomber jacket like bright pink bright blue so <malay>macam</malay> I really going down the mountain like wearing casual clothes and then these mountain people
I think they were tourists also
ya and they were clearly ready they had water bottle
ya no the first thing we did was get a Grab go back to go back to our place drink water
ya
what a morning
what time did we leave we leave the house I think six or five five or six
and think we went back like eleven right
ya we we rested for like one two hours I think so
the city
ya <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak puas</malay> [kan]
we we climb the mountain
okay to be fair our view was very good also
ya okay
[ah] that that's the plan [ah] that's the plan ten years down the road
so
two zero two seven
return to cape town
we all <malay>melayu</malay> together
we we find a life there right
before we die when we finally get employed
!hais!
you told her
you talk all the <malay>masjid-masjid</malay>
okay but to be fair I told you you can have done your own things
what
cause of my mum right she wanted to donate all the mosques
all the <malay>masjid</malay>
[eh] but to be fair right we hit we hit up all the mosques
like it was quite surprising that there was
ya and then like cause it's also like
like basically we were just exploring the city [lah] cause we hit one end to the other end to the other end
it was all walking distance right
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
ya even though it was basically just to deposit money
I know we did like
<malay>kita ikut macam ada</malay> walking tour [kan] <malay>tapi tu kita tak</malay> halfway <malay>kita macam</malay>
we we bail out
[ah] what else
<malay>kira</malay> was cape town itself and then when we went for that safari after the school
okay how about we start with food
the safari so we had so basically <malay>lepas kita dah</malay>
we we went there for the exchange and the exchange for like a few weeks right ya
ya it felt so long right ya like <malay>hari-hari ada benda nak buat</malay>
weekend <malay>kita orang pergi mana</malay>
<malay>pergi entah</malay> [lah] <malay>sekolah bawa gi jalan-jalan kat mana</malay> it's like literally weekend trip to a different part of
(um) south africa
and then the field trip the accommodations my god
[ah] the my god is a very good my god not like a bad
I mean to be fair they took all our money also
it was it was very bulgy I think also cause majority of the <malay>budak-budak yang ada</malay> were <malay>budak apa</malay> american so like I think they had to up like they wanted to make sure these americans <malay>tak</malay> complain <malay>sangat</malay> confirm <malay>dorang</malay> complain ya
ya so for that after <malay>kita dah belajar</malay> for the summer programme then we had like this one week plus of safari so <malay>kita orang pergi</malay> (um) basically we went up the coast of southern south africa
and then <malay>kita</malay> ya basically went and look at all
I mean safari we imagine I'm assuming people will imagine like flat lands and lions which we did
we saw we saw them but like <malay>kat</malay> reserve like we had to enter a reserve to look at all the wild animals and it's not like a zoo where you know where they are cause you is if you're lucky then you get to see if you're not lucky then you don't get to see
ya
so in terms of the safari let's see what what food I just want to think about the food
[oh] ya I think cause we were at the coast
[ah] yes the ostrich
we were at a ostrich farm
ya
so the meat that we ate were the ostriches we saw that day in the afternoon then we ate their brother
ya
no particularly memorable food per say
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[oh] there was more than three right four I think <malay>empat</malay>
<malay>sepuluh kot</malay> and then <malay>macam aku tahu</malay> we had to sign up right for the vans and then we had to put our names down for which vans you want to be in
you know cause these americans
just just saying
ya and
#ish#
they not mature yet
ya so like
so we sign up we sign up for like the last van cause <malay>tak ada orang</malay> like no americans wrote their names there I think right so we put names for the last van
ya a few and other from right with a few other singaporeans and then
the
ya
ya same <malay>tanah air</malay>
<malay>terus</malay>
(um) ya and then like all the americans already had their cliques and whatever so they <malay>dorang taruk nama dorang</malay> in the first few vans or whatever you know supposedly it's gonna be like a fun trip for them
!woohoo! that kind of thing but then we went in like [meh] we just make new friends I guess in this new
van
and then (err) at the end of the whole thing we realised <malay>yang apa ni orang yang dalam van kita semua macam lebih</malay> mature I would say [eh] and like our van was like the most diverse diverse group of people and we knew we don't really know each other [lah] <malay>sebelum tu</malay> when we started the trip
but then by the end of the trip like the vans like the first like the the van <malay>yang</malay> first first <malay>tu semua macam</malay>
<malay>nanti dorang tak jadi kawan lagi ke apa</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay> at first <malay>dorang</malay> start off <malay>macam ghairah nak mampus macam</malay> !woo! !woo! !woo! <malay>tapi tu</malay> at the end of the
like the whole week <malay>dorang macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> enemies [eh] <malay>macam tak nak dorang gaduh banyak tak cakap apa-apa padahal untuk</malay> van <malay>kita</malay>
beginning <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak kesah</malay> all then at the end of the whole thing <malay>kita orang macam</malay> !woo! !woo! !woo!
[a'ah]
avoid
ya and not only that we sacrifice one another like sacrifice ourselves
to
ya
<malay>berapa</malay> one week plus
ya ya
<malay>tak</malay>
I think he enjoy it [lah]
ya I mean got to be fair
he is a bit questionable but whatever
yes
with him never mind don't need
we had fun
I remember when <malay>kita dah balik</malay> he still message me for photo
ya he's like natasha where's my photos
I'm like ya like okay <malay>hantar hantar hantar hantar</malay>
ya the food wasn't much to say but ya the people
so what what did we do <malay>kita buat</malay> [oh] we did bungee jumping
kayaking in the river right
ya I that [one] I don't think I will forget cause I had to partner with the guy
and then everybody didn't want to paddle next to our boat so everybody just went ahead of us
[oh] <malay>dia tolak</malay>
[a'ah]
<malay>aku tahu</malay>
yes
yes I remember
I remember scolding him
okay what else did we do kayak
the reserve
[oh] my god
the cave
I was just talking about this to my friend [tau]
ya I was like <malay>siapa</malay> [eh] I think #kaysa# [eh] anyway I was just telling her like
you know the other day like it's one of the few things that I will remember for life getting stuck in a cave
!hais!
I mean to be fair I warn everybody I was like telling them I feel like I will confirm get stuck cause I have no eye-hand coordination
let alone with my legs I no coordination whatsoever so I will I think I will get stuck in the hole
everybody laugh it off
and then what happened
I got stuck in the freaking hole
I couldn't see where my legs were I couldn't see where I was going so of course I just <malay>raba raba</malay>
ya and then at then during dinner I still remember someone like do you that someone was stuck in a cave and then I was over there ya that was me
then she automatically [oh] really I'm so sorry
[ah] okay (hmm)
a cave
(mm)
the highlight reel
you know hunger games then got the cannon boom
[eh]
so instead instead of the <malay>muka-muka kawan</malay> it's basically
do you want to see another prompt
do you want to talk about the food <malay>atau makanan atau</malay> everyday activity
(err) if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
[oh]
[oh]
<malay>aku baru nak tanya</malay> what's stopping you
ya I mean
it's still considered art
sure
okay
one skill
no the question was three but never mind I don't <malay>tengok</malay> we take turns [ah]
(um)
one new skill
(hmm)
[ah] I know I want to learn how to ice skate
for no reason whatsoever but just to have fun
I mean <malay>dulu aku pernah</malay>
primary school <malay>pernah belajar apa</malay> inline skating so I'm assuming that it will be similar to ice skating
I asked
ice
I feel like I <malay>pernah tanya</malay> #kaysa#
cause #kaysa# does ice skating
apparently her whole family does
ya you know <malay>hari tu dorang saja-saja satu keluarga pergi pergi apa ni kat</malay> #kallang# <malay>punya</malay> [eh] ice skating <malay>sama-sama</malay> and then <malay>dorang</malay> complain <malay>budak-budak tu kacau</malay>
okay anyway ya but like she said I think she said like inline skating is kind of
similar like if you can <malay>naik</malay> if you can inline skate then you can ice skate that's what she said
but I'm still assuming it's a new skill
so ya I mean that will be very fun
