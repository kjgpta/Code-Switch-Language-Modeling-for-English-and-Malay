[ah] like massage parlours all <malay>dah tutup</malay>
a lot <malay>yang</malay> know like people with families [lah] with families I think affected them a lot <malay>orang</malay> some of them <malay>macam duduk kat kedai kopi hari-hari</malay> you know cannot do anything have to wait for this thing to be over <malay>kesian</malay>
(err) yes (err)
like one of them (err)

<malay>tanam sayur dapat gaji</malay> [lah] <malay>sikit-sikit</malay>
ya <malay>yang macam</malay> [kan] normally [kan] over there when you park your car before you move [kan] <malay>ada orang datang</malay> they they call it <malay>orang tukang</malay> parking [lah] so they <malay>jaga</malay> to park <malay>jaga</malay> that parking area parking shift so one day I think the pay is about hundred thousand which is about singapore ten dollars
[eh] ya ten dollars [lah]
just to (err)
(err) so corn is a one year harvest program [lah] something like that
[ah] so if one year harvest corn then one year later

what do you call it the massage spa <malay>abeh</malay> shopping centre
how's the the the the the situation there
[oh] okay okay okay ya see I see I see then when when you come back from (err) #batam# I I know you went #batam# but I when did you went to #batam#
you went there for your business
!huh! that means from singapore you have to fly to #jakarta# first then from #jakarta# quarantine for one night <malay>lepas tu duduk satu malam satu malam naik kapal terbang</malay> then <malay>pergi</malay> #batam# why never go #batam# directly from singapore take ferry
I see
[ah] okay okay that makes sense I was thinking of why why you have to go through the whole long process then when you when you come back to singapore
twelve (err) november
[orh] then after that you have to quarantine for two weeks [lah] [ah]
so how how is the quarantine in singapore the people a lot people complain [lah] facebook [lah] they say not nice [lah] some of them I I I don't know but how how is it is it easy to come back to singapore from from #batam# or is there any requirement that you need to get

[ah] okay okay okay so you you
#batam# from #batam# you take from harbourfront right you stop at harbourfront

[ah] it's just probably he never come back to singapore for seventeen years [lah] probably
[ah] maybe
[ah] so maybe haven't come singapore seventeen years so he thought like <malay>macam</malay> nazi [lah] but so it's just a systematic that you just need to follow the whole sequence and then after that if you have any questions you just ask information <malay>lepas tu dia akan bilang mana nak pergi mana nak pergi sana pergi sini</malay> probably they are quite busy they are not suppose to talk much for for certain reason [ah]
ya [lah] too much [lah] this one [ah] anyway [ah] so your two weeks how okay everything
[ah] okay [lah] because there is also people you know some you know from every you know now social media very strong right some people say stay in the hotel singapore not good and then some request to have balcony some request to have #sentosa# hotel I don't know [lah] these people sometimes I thinking if let say you want to prefer all these kind of thing then might as well don't come out from singapore in the beginning [ah] <malay>betul tak</malay> then just stay in singapore don't need to come out ya
[ah]
[ah]
[orh]

talking about COVID no COVID
now already fifth december already another few more
days three more weeks [dah] end of the year already !wah! very fast man correct or not [ah]
!alamak!
[ah]
new year <malay>tahun ini</malay> <malay>jawapan dia duduk kat rumah diam-diam makan nasi lemak</malay>
<malay>betul betul betul</malay> I think now I heard this year countdown they won't be doing a main event like how they do previous year because they want to cut down the crowd [lah] so
<malay>kemungkinan</malay>
<malay>apa-apa yang</malay> countdown <malay>semua dekat</malay> neighbourhood estate [jer] [lah]
I think I have the feeling that maybe they go by zoning [lah] <malay>macam</malay> north east south west <malay>ke apa</malay> so <malay>kat mana-mana yang</malay> okay <malay>kau tinggal</malay> north <malay>ada bunga api tinggal</malay> south <malay>ada bunga api</malay> west <malay>ada bunga api</malay> so instead of going to the central <malay>punya bunga api</malay> so everybody goes your own division their own area their own <malay>kampung</malay> to enjoy [lah] but anyway I mean
this is a new beginning [ah] they call it the new norm for now for I have the feeling that most of the people will get used to it and then by
don't know [lah] [ah] I just feel that this COVID thing is moving very fast I just feel like
it just happen like one month ago but actually now almost end of the year already almost one year finish already
correct
singapore <malay>bila</malay>
sixteen march <malay>ke</malay>
sixteen march [eh]
sixteen march <malay>dia orang tutup</malay> sixteen march <malay>sekali kira</malay> march april may june july august september november [a'ah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>dah sembilan bulan</malay> [ah]
but but very fast [ah] nine months
<malay>pejam celik pejam celik dah</malay> nine months <malay>dah nak masuk satu tahun</malay>
then maybe january twenty twenty one I not sure I don't think can still travel in twenty twenty one [ah] that's what they said is probably two two [lah] so
so good thing cannot travel save money for this one year so twenty twenty two a lot of people will start travelling again
correct correct
(mm)
okay [lah] spend money in singapore [lah] staycation now government give [ah] hundred dollars voucher you take already
but you cannot book directly to the hotel [lah] I think you have to book to those but five platform only
<malay>tak</malay>
you no need to take <malay>sikit-sikit</malay> [what] what you can do okay because this hundred dollars is given in the denomination of ten but
the places that you want to go (err) places of interest or staycation
you have to book through these five different platform okay (err) <malay>yang satu</malay> #changi# and then (err) I think trip (err) there's another three more [lah] <malay>aku tak ingat mana satu</malay> (err) then
you have to book through this platform book online
before you finish your process of payment then you have to
click under redeem vouchers then it will redirect you to your singpass [ah] and then from there then you can use [lah] you can either you have to use a whole hundred dollars
can you can use hundred dollars full to offset your staycation in a hotel for yourself [ah] you can use that or you can use partly the only thing <malay>yang</malay> you cannot do <malay>yang kau tak boleh buat</malay> is <malay>kau buat</malay> stack up <malay>maknanya aku ada satu ratus kau ada satu ratus</malay> then <malay>kita</malay> combine <malay>dua ratus kita</malay> stay in hotel for free [ah] <malay>itu tak boleh tapi</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say that hotel is two hundred dollars but I only use my hundred dollars and then I can (uh) offset their hundred dollars I only pay four hundred dollars but I cannot stack up if I stack up [ah] that means I can get you me some other of my friends ten person then got one thousand dollars then I can stay in presidential suite already but cannot that's how they do it [lah] so in the domination of ten meaning let say <malay>kalau kau</malay> example <malay>kalau kau pergi</malay> zoo <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] maybe zoo I don't know but now I'm not sure how much is the price maybe about twenty dollars then you just use ten dollars and then you know you you can use still pay ten dollars [lah] or maybe you pay you offset twenty dollars something like that [ah] <malay>tapi tak boleh</malay> combine [lah] that's how it goes but
okay [lah] they want us to spend money in singapore spend money in singapore [lah] but where to go I also don't know
I mean if you go because is until july twenty twenty one [lah] so there is no need to rush because
I believe people are all rushing for this december because is school holiday so if you are talking about using the vouchers during this period [ah]
I have the feeling they would be fully book and then hotels fully book you know tourist fully booked because a lot of people like to go so no need to <malay>kelam-kabut kata orang</malay> [kan] [ah] <malay>pelan-pelan</malay> [ah] next year <malay>pun boleh</malay> january <malay>pun boleh</malay> february <malay>pun boleh</malay> as long as <malay>pakai sebelum</malay> july [lah] so ya
<malay>kau belum pernah pergi</malay> sea aquarium [ah] [eh] talking about sea aquarium <malay>aku pun pernah pergi</malay> [ah] adventure cove
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
[eh]
correct correct but I not sure probably COVID I not sure whether water cove open or not but then if you ask me to go zoo #jurong# bird park #sentosa# I don't want [lah] so all these places went already [ah] so I need to go something different [ah] maybe
use
use one one voucher to stay staycation two days one night [ah] maybe those hotel that you really want to go but you know but you don't have chance to go there but hundred dollars how much cannot
unless you go to smaller hotels [lah] you want to go those like hotel [ah] of course you need to come out still same price [lah] not much difference [ah] anyway
ya
[ah]
serious [ah]
government give us [ah]
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] <malay>mampus</malay>
[ah] okay okay I understand
[ah] so at least singapore is
so call we are lucky in a way that government is still taking care of us giving us some some rebates some help some assistance in terms of finance rebates for house rebates for electricity but other countries totally nothing [lah]
!huh!
<malay>macam mana boleh tak</malay> orginal <malay>ada potong potong ke mampus</malay> <malay>kat mana ni kat</malay> #batam# <malay>ni</malay> indonesia [lah]
so meaning for example if let say they government for example government say promise them one thousand rupiah [lah] example [ah] one thousand rupiah but by the time it reach them left maybe five hundred rupiah only then that five hundred go where along the way so that five hundred consider from one place
<malay>dia ambil</malay> they take a bit of commission a bit of a bit of help a bit right so at the end <malay>sampai orang punya tangan dah tinggal lima ratus</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>kurang</malay> [ah] !wah! <malay>ini macam pun boleh</malay> [eh] <malay>mati</malay>
<malay>kesempatan dalam kesempitan</malay>
<malay>mampus</malay> take advantage of the whole situation [lah] to get something [ah]
be quite too expensive or what
no
!huh!
so under table
so meaning
so meaning like how
!huh! I don't get it so meaning okay let's say now I I I go to hospital but I do not know my result
and then (uh) hospital just to get money from the government
they will say that you are positive then this hospital send this positive patient to where
to the quarantine area
just to refer one person to quarantine you get money what's the purpose why why
is better to refer a negative to a place to say that you are negative that means you are helping the economics or you are helping the country to lower down the cases rather than every person you say positive then if every person goes to hospital without checking you say positive then the number of goes up [what] then what's the point of
<malay>takut</malay>
<malay>takut daripada</malay> negative <malay>jadi</malay> positive
!huh!
bullshit
!huh!
I don't get it funny look I mean if if if hospital get money to inform the government that this patient is negative it make sense but if they hospital without checking inform the patient that they are positive and then get money ya
but it's better to get
more negative numbers in your country then positive [what] right so why is the other way round
what the
<malay>tak faham</malay>
<malay>betul-betul punya tak faham</malay>
really happen
until now [ah]
how much how much they can get for for for for one person
[oh] that that is wasting your money I rather then you waste rather than you waste your money to just inform and get a referral to refer a patient to a quarantine area might as well get that money to help your medical in terms of
medical things or medicine to improve your medicine better [what]
funny [ah]
why [ah] like that
anyway
<malay>macam-macam</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>sekarang ni</malay>
ya
[oh] ya ya #saiful# one so touching [ah] I didn't know that he will do that video was like I was like what he really record down the video he say he miss his wife who is in then after that what he did he he go and purchase the binoculars two binoculars one for him one for his wife he send to his wife then after that <malay>pergi kat semberang tambak</malay> #johor# and and one of them <malay>dekat</malay> woodland one of them <malay>dekat</malay> #johor# <malay>dekat apa tu tempat tu</malay> [eh] [eh]

I do not know [ah] shared that video of he waving at his wife both of them using binoculars waving at each other in opposite one is #johor# one is #woodlands# so cute you know but
do not know haven't go viral yet [ah] whoever pick up that story [ah] go viral [ah]
no [lah] he I think yes he no [eh]
this year ya correct correct because right right right
correct because why we wanted to go for his wedding that was [ah] ya ya we wanted to go for his wedding in so everybody was applying for leave #marhan# was also asking for leave then #iskandar# was asking me [eh] bro <malay>boleh pinjam kereta nak pergi masuk</malay> #johor# <malay>aku cakap</malay> okay [lah] <malay>pakai</malay> [lah] <malay>kereta masuk</malay> #johor# because of
(err) #saiful# wedding then along the way I think because of this COVID <malay>semua tarik-tarik</malay> then in the end decided not to go when the announcement came that those who goes to singapore [ah] those from singaporean goes to overseas come back have to do quarantine have to do swab everything then become viral so in the end <malay>tak jadi pergi</malay> but #alhamdulillah# they get married in singapore first before the main one at malaysia [what] so <malay>kat</malay> malaysia <malay>semua</malay> cancel [kan] everything cancel because of this COVID ya ya ya true true true this year ya I think ya ya after that [ah] I think during that period still
people are still <malay>was-was</malay> fifty fifty whether to go or not to go to go or not to go then after that
I think one is it one month or few weeks
before the actual (err) wedding then it comes out into regulation that singapore is banning people from travelling that's the part everything cancel [kan] for him
and then the wife is there but lucky he get married in singapore then after that go <malay>sanding dekat</malay> #johor# [kan] ya ya ya true true true true
ask his wife to come singapore [ah] bring in
he is going back to #johor#
so he's
no but singapore <malay>pun ada</malay>
singapore <malay>boleh</malay>
then after that he's
ya but the <malay>nikah dekat</malay> singapore <malay>kan</malay> #johor# okay
[oh] he is going back #johor# now
then
no pay leave two months [lah] singapore no pay leave two months [ah]
[ah] then after that bring in the wife come singapore

<malay>tak tahu</malay> because if not have to pay still have to pay [what] that means he if he bring his wife
[oh] ya if he bring his wife back to singapore not only him have to pay two thousand for
for two weeks he also have to pay for the wife two thousand so almost five thousand already
then going malaysia
how how long you have to stay
in malaysia if we go malaysia #johor# you have to stay two weeks staycation so not say staycation [lah]
<malay>empat ribu enam ratus ringgit ringgit dah macam</malay> divide by three one thousand plus [lah] so he has to stay two weeks first in the hotel for stay home I mean (err) [lah] consider
but singapore
the the the cases zero [what] community wise why go there still still need to
stay for two weeks instead of seven days <malay>kelakar betul</malay> [lah] malaysia <malay>ini</malay>
subsidise [lah]
I mean if if if now (err) the malaysian cases went up from seven day if let's say from malaysia to come singapore you have to stay before was seven days right now because of the increase in number then become fourteen days make sense but if singaporeans wants to go #johor# knowing singapore cases community cases are zero now

I already moved to a new house already correct so now I'm doing a bakery
food halal filipino food
now I'm doing this halal because right I'm I'm looking at in this in this situation [eh] whereby if let's say you go to
any restaurants or you go to online or you want you know singaporeans being singaporeans we want to taste a lot of foods I mean that is nice there is is a nature is a niche correct so <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> a lot of <malay>macam</malay>
food [eh] asian food [eh] <malay>kau kata</malay> [kan] japanese chinese korean
thai vietnamese
that is all halal [tau] in southeast don't talk about malaysian food indonesian food [lah] <malay>banyak kat</malay> singapore if you talk about talk about japanese halal food there is a lot okay coming up

indian okay [lah] they have <malay>tak payah cakap</malay> [ah] western so many fusion food you go to arab street you see from one end to one end a lot of fish and chips whatever was so I was thinking I was asking my girlfriend hopefully [lah] #inshaallah# [eh] <malay>kalau mungkin jadi isteri</malay> [kan] I was asking her [eh]
since you can cook well why don't we do filipino
halal food because
there is no filipino halal food except
one company
jollibee
ooh
[ah] is a niche there is only halal filipino
cuisine from philippine there is jollibee even there is this called mexican and (err) gerry's grill is also not halal
so why not we do halal filipino food so it came out into the ideas what we now we are doing it like
filipino kind of place [lah] be it bakery cheesecake are all cheesecake muffins are all muffins right but
we put (err) (err) (err)
different taste local of a filipino taste [lah] so yes we did that already so #alhamdulillah# there's a few orders coming in for our cheesecake for our muffin and now being you know now end of the year december right so we are doing roasted chicken lemon pepper
and then (err) lemon herbs and then the other one is portuguese spicy so all filipino <malay>punya</malay> taste [lah] so okay [lah] #alhamdulillah# there's a few orders coming in so we are doing that and then (err) come out into pasta and we are coming up into some filipinos taste [lah] so hopefully
home made [ah]
hopefully [lah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
correct
[ah]
[ah]
but for now haven't ya so I want to hopefully be the
hopefully [lah] [ah] be the first one to go and open of course restaurant wise still not yet [lah] because capital not not not there yet so now do stuff on home base first (uh) (uh)
ya because why I was inspired by this
by this lady they call it (err)
if you go into this that it's call
thai thai I thai ice tea okay
very simple what she she does is a she's a thai
of convert [lah] then she's thai she convert and then what she did is she sells crepes
and thai tea made made made of thai tea [lah] crepes and everything and just this simple (err) food of (uh) tea I think tea tea thailand and (uh) crepes and and (err) of course she use to be an air stewardess but now she because she of this COVID everything right so she open a home based business [lah] #alhamdulillah# it was it was people like accepting it and that they order and I was like [eh] not bad [ah] and she's basically just a local doing thai milk tea and thai crepes only (uh) <malay>itu</malay> [jer] <malay>dia punya kirakan dia punya</malay> ingredient [ah]
okay [lah] good [lah] I was thinking
correct
true
ya [lah]
so ya [lah] so now I'm I'm I'm looking into these areas hopefully [lah] hopefully can can go into this small little corner to to to get something after you know all these
COVID thing a bit of loss of income ten percent pay cut no pay leave some more for days then it's like really like still need to survive being in singapore correct so I think hopefully it it it does helps a bit [lah]
