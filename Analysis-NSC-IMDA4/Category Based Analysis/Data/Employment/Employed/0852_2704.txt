and then ya if I can
wait for them I will make [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> sometimes because I'm also like working part time as well like juggling three jobs at the same time [oh] my god
so I'm baking from home doing facebook live selling clothes and also doing a part time job
as of now <malay>sekarang</malay> [ah] I prefer <malay>baju jual baju</malay>

sunrise ya we have to clean we have to
yes you have to clean after every practical after every practical
is a kitchen so you have to clean up our clean up is like thorough clean up as well (um) <malay>sapu</malay>
<malay>lepas tu mop lepas tu cuci</malay> all the pan pots all wash
it make sure it's clean make sure it's clean and dry then make sure once the chef comes back he touch the table and there's
no flour on it make sure there's no dust or flour it just like okay and then <malay>jap</malay> when you <malay>cakap macam gitu teringat macam</malay> [oh] okay <malay>macam sama kat sekolah aku pun sama bikin gitu</malay>
but we only clean the inside of the classes which is quite big [lah] because is a kitchen what is a kitchen so it's quite big

the school is horrible [sia] so so big like super big like if your class is at
<malay>hujung sekali kalau kelas</malay> you <malay>hujung sekali</malay> your canteen is <malay>hujung sini</malay>
that's it your break time lunch time that's it you got no space to eat everytime everyone come ready sit ready got no space
but at least you have a recognise diploma
(mm)
but one thing that I find
(um) very sad [lah] about my life is that I have diploma but it doesn't work
basically it's useless which
to my defense I didn't know <malay>sebab bila</malay> I (uh) <malay>apa</malay> apply for this <malay>sekolah dia orang cakap</malay> [oh] this diploma is recognisable everywhere in singapore outside of singapore is recognisable !wah! but when apply <malay>kerja</malay> horrible
no they do not recognise [ah] <malay>apa</malay> private diploma singapore don't recognise private diploma even <malay>kawan-kawan</malay> I <malay>yang kerja</malay>
[eh] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>yang apa yang</malay> M <malay>yang macam</malay> you know is private <malay>juga</malay> [kan] <malay>ataupun apa</malay>
P B S [eh]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] that [one] private also [kan] that [one] also not recognise [tau] <malay>sebab</malay> private
<malay>tapi</malay> is like quite the amount is so much for a private but then end up you don't use my for you you <malay>korang bagi kerja korang tak nak</malay> accept
no sound about that can you can you try to understand but it's not about that it it just
it's not about that I'm talking about why singapore do not accept private diploma
okay if you want to use on me okay if you want to use on me I apply for jobs using my why they don't accept me use something can use something
my is social media and web development I have photoshop I know I know coding I can get amazing jobs
yes
exactly so you cannot give me that kind of answer if you don't know the answer
<malay>takde</malay> [lah]
<malay>takde</malay> [lah] culinary job is I understand
I understand is (err)
my private diploma is only to get culinary jobs
because my private diploma is culinary
so I understand that part is like <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] but then
I still do study to get my diploma
okay but then that [one] [ah] you know what you forget about it you let me use my NITEC so I been applying for NITEC
from NITEC
so now you are saying like okay you do not know what is happening okay so I <malay>bilang</malay>
basically !alah! <malay>macam banyak</malay> job <malay>banyak</malay> [jer] <malay>orang yang tak ada kerja</malay> but I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] maybe I'm looking at the wrong places <malay>mungkin</malay> my agents are not really good
no ya that's why like most of them <malay>macam</malay> I wanna leave singapore I don't want to stay at singapore or something but to live at singapore you need job honey
to get money
<malay>maksudnya</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya
[a'ah] like <malay>dia cepat-cepat sangat dia</malay> progress
no [lah] I mean I am grateful right (err) singapore progress fast
[ah] I'm grateful that we <malay>jadi ita tak ke belakang</malay> [tau] <malay>jadi kita tak ada</malay> slow
okay I'm grateful for that (um) ya you know some of our neighbouring country is like that
okay so so I'm ungrateful for singapore being too (um) being able to progress very fast and so like the younger generation like us or our
future kids you know future grandchildren you know <malay>dia orang akan dapat macam</malay> a lot of privileges [lah] and then same time <malay>makan maju lagi cepat dari kita lagi</malay>
<malay>pintar pintar</malay> [eh] !wow! <malay>bahasa melayu pintar</malay> is <malay>pintar</malay> is <malay>pandai</malay> [lah] ya I don't know <malay>tiba-tiba</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>nak pakai</malay> [lah] <malay>ni pandai</malay> okay <malay>pandai tapi</malay>
ya but I'm seriously like grateful [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> singapore <malay>macam</malay> very multiracial multiracial and then <malay>macam</malay> we don't we don't really have like racial discrimination amongst the
all of us [tau] we do but we don't really have so it's like
thank god
you know thank god okay so okay [lah] singapore is okay [lah] I would say okay
ya
for me singapore job is [ah] ya ya a bit difficult for me to get singapore job <malay>sebab kena banyak</malay> mandarin mandarin <malay>kena banyak berbual</malay> mandarin then <malay>macam</malay>
