but apparently he said it's one sided [lah] cause the person keep on message but then <malay>dia tak layan sangat</malay> [lah] cause the girl very toxic last time ya that type I hope he's good to her [lah] not like the the #cheebye# #kia# ex
(uh) the ex is our age but she looks twenty five
ya legit legit (uh) next time I send you the her <malay>gambar</malay> very
[a'ah] <malay>betul betul</malay> ya
ya he haven't delete then he also <malay>belum</malay> delete the insta story all these then I tell rachel [lah] [eh] you better be a bit careful [lah] maybe he lowkey also not over her then she's like [ah] ya I will [lah]
but she say she confident that he will choose her over the girl [lah] cause the girl very toxic like don't the girl always every time must only <malay>keluar</malay> with her only he <malay>tak boleh keluar</malay> with his other friends she <malay>tak suka</malay> the other friends also
so <malay>macam</malay> like everything must be with her only that type that type of girl ya
weird [lah] [sia]

[eh] <malay>salah</malay> the shoe was ya about two hundred then he also bought her another three hundred dollar marc marc jacob <malay>ke apa</malay> wallet then aku macam !wow! <malay>untung</malay> [sia] <malay>kau</malay> finally you get a man that treasure you [sia] then she's like ya I know right
ya
ya [eh] you know about the olivero also right
he he weird he cannot move on over the fact that rachel already got new and better guy
do you are you in
ya and his wedding is supposed to be this month [leh] august [eh] that's why I was like the fuck

ya
did you see his close friends the latest one
the one he post something like (um) nevermind even if I'm sad I will just let them be I think he was indirectly rachel and the new guy [sia] then I show I screenshot to rachel then she was an <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>dia ini</malay> ignore [jer] [lah] <malay>sudah</malay> weirdo [sia] #rilek# like he obsessed ya that's why
his soon to be wife
then what about your friend the toxic another one
a movie
<malay>tunang</malay>
(mmhmm)
for me [ah] cause to be honest you told me about her ex right like the ex cheat on her then always use her money all these then like why would you want to be with someone like that some more certis cisco you know it's not a stable job you earn a lot of money only cause you (um) and is very the timetable very #rabak# so if you date someone like that you can only go out with them at night like that
and most of their days is very busy [what] so I'm like just go for the guy [lah] he seems like a better choice but then if she really cannot wait for two years then I feel like she should just let go of the guy cause he deserves better imagine you with someone then you keep on thinking why I have to go through this again bastard [sia] the guy can could've find someone better [what]
then
what she want to do now
(um) I think she know what to do already [lah] just dump the new guy [lah] sis from what he sounds like <malay>macam buat pakai</malay> only like only use her when he need money all this then
it's a new relationship and you already keep arguing like that it's a red flag though just tell her to get back with her ex [lah]
cause he doesn't sound good
I think my boyfriend would beat him up [sia]
then
how did the new guy react
(mmhmm)
okay
then tell her find new guys block both of these two
but I think right your friend loves all this drama and attention that's why she's doing nothing to stop it
but okay [lah] no [lah] I mean for like girls normal [lah] they like cause if two guys fight over you who don't like <malay>siapa tak suka</malay> I also like
if a lot of guys fight over you [oh] why like so flower like that
[a'ah] [seh]
[a'ah] [seh]
but then she not stress [meh] from all these drama
[a'ah]
