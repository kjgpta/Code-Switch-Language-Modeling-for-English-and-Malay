if we could eat one food for the rest of our life
what would it be
(hmm)
<malay>sama</malay> [lah] I also
because <malay>bila</malay> food
food [eh]
but nugget <malay>pun</malay> chicken [what]
<malay>bodoh</malay>
(hmm)
if it's one <malay>lauk</malay> for the rest of my life
<malay>apa sambal goreng pengantin</malay> with <malay>ketupat</malay> or with <malay>nasi</malay>
or <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> with <malay>bergedil</malay> and <malay>nasi</malay>
ya
and sis <malay>tak akan</malay> get bored
ya but I think like the most frequent <malay>makanan yang</malay> I crave for is
<malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> [lah]
like ya because to me like <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> is
life
<malay>sebab</malay> you will have everything there
you got <malay>paru</malay>
you got
<malay>ada</malay> veggie [ah] <malay>ada sambal kacang panjang</malay>
<malay>ada tahu tempeh</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> chicken
<malay>hati ayam pedal</malay> [eh] <malay>hati ayam ke pedal</malay> [eh]
<malay>limpa</malay> [eh]
<malay>bukan</malay> [eh] <malay>hati ayam</malay> [kan]
(hmm)
<malay>lagi-lagi ada udang</malay>
[ah] so <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> is like everything that I like to eat is what <malay>macam satu</malay> dish you <malay>makan dengan bergedil makan dengan nasi sedap</malay> [seh]
but it's considered one [what] <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
(oo) <malay>tak</malay> consider [eh]
why why <malay>macam</malay> why like that
what <malay>tapi itu</malay> [lah] okay [lah] <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>sambal goreng dengan nasi pun jadi</malay> sis
<malay>pulut begitu</malay> [jer]
<malay>pulut tak ada rasa</malay> sis
one food [lah]
<malay>pulut</malay> [lah] but you cannot put other <malay>lauk</malay>
[ah] one food [what] it's like one like it's like one dish
[ah] <malay>tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>pulut</malay>
because <malay>pulut</malay> is one dish
see if talking about dish
then
the <malay>pulut</malay> is not a <malay>makanan</malay> it's not considered [lah]
but food is life
[kan]
because food is life <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>badan kita</malay> sis
(hmm)
(hmm)
seafood
(hmm)
<malay>bodoh</malay> <malay>bodoh</malay>
!huh! what dang
<malay>habis</malay>
<malay>habis</malay> sis <malay>nak makan apa</malay> make up your mind
(oo) if <malay>kita boleh</malay>
choose like <malay>macam</malay>
buffet is consider
like
buffet
consider
a dish <malay>tak</malay>
like if it's a type
buffet I can eat buffet for the rest of my life [ah]
like buffet !wow!
sis
!walao!
<malay>teh tarik</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> sugar cane
!wow!
!wow! sis
but top-up how many
but <malay>dia tak ada</malay> <malay>dia tak ada</malay> limited hours you <malay>boleh duduk dekat dalam</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> if you go <malay>yang kita pergi dekat</malay> #yishun# <malay>tu yang</malay> <malay>tu</malay> [kan] if lunch is two hours
then mainly like now buffet because of COVID the it's two hours but <malay>yang</malay> <malay>dia</malay> dinner <malay>dia</malay> up to four hours around three and a half hours [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay>
maybe because <malay>dia macam</malay> on the wheel <malay>sebab tu dia boleh duduk dekat situ</malay> like three hours
but sometimes I wonder what like <malay>kenapa</malay> Seoul Garden <malay>tak boleh</malay> extend <malay>dia punya duduk dekat dalam</malay>
but what are the chances that
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] but if like <malay>pun ramai orang masuk apa</malay>
<malay>mana</malay> Seoul Garden Seoul Garden <malay>kita duduk sebelum dua jam</malay> [seh]
or exactly two hours then <malay>kita gerak sebab kita dah terlalu</malay> full
ya
so maybe next time we can try [lah] <malay>duduk dekat dalam</malay>
for like two hours plus and <malay>tengok kena halau ke tak</malay>
what
we should we should <malay>apa</malay> what's the word [ah] bearing up acts what's the word experiment experiment that
experiment experiment that
but the the the the only downside of
<malay>yang</malay> is because <malay>dia tak ada</malay> they should <malay>buat air dalam</malay> jug <malay>taruk dekat situ</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> Seoul Garden so it's easy <malay>pasal kita kalau nak tunggu dia orang</malay> the person <malay>hantar air</malay>
<malay>lambat</malay> [seh]
[ah] <malay>lepas tu nanti orang tu</malay> get irritated
<malay>macam</malay> that time <malay>pasal</malay> #naan# <malay>tu</malay>
the person <malay>yang</malay> get irritated

the
(err) <malay>macam</malay> to to the guy <malay>macam</malay> he is in between believing <malay>macam dia dia</malay> as
<malay>dia percaya</malay> in the unseen as part of faith
<malay>tapi</malay>
cannot mix with science [what] so he's trying to do both [tau] to be like <malay>nak</malay> try to make a logic of that
<malay>habis lepas tu</malay>
but <malay>ya</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> logic and faith sometimes but to me to me personally logic and faith have to coexist together
but <malay>benda</malay> unseen <malay>ni</malay>
we cannot <malay>macam</malay>
and it's not of our faith to like <malay>rukun iman</malay> we have to believe in the unseen <malay>sebab tu</malay>
cannot stack means [ah] me and you together pay together cannot so I have to pay my own personally you have to pay yours personally ya [lah] it's like that [lah]
I don't know [lah] sis <malay>ingat nak pergi</malay>

cannot stack that is not <malay>macam tak boleh</malay> is not refundable
so that means if like if you pay seventy five you pay eighty dollars then it's not worth it [lah]
<malay>dia cuma cakap begitu</malay> [jer] <malay>apa</malay> so I think I can pay one ticket [ah]
I I will take the express one [ah]

because the <malay>keris</malay> is not a normal <malay>keris sebab keris tu</malay> is
<malay>dah</malay> fuse black magic
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
[kan] <malay>tiba</malay>
was it <malay>dia tengah</malay> driving <malay>ke apa</malay> no [eh] no no no no that was in aerostar bay [eh]
[ha] <malay>engkau tak kelakar</malay> [eh] brother
it's not funny [sia] you not funny <malay>lu lu cari pasal sama wa</malay> brother
inviting
okay I have this question [ah] like for example [kan] okay when
in islam we believe right <malay>kalau kita mati</malay> our <malay>roh</malay> does not exist co-exist in this <malay>alam</malay> already so that means we are in another dimension [tau] so our dimension only <malay>macam</malay> co-exist time we sleep <malay>betul tak</malay> so like for example if <malay>kita mati kita nampak orang-orang</malay> people then if
is it the <malay>roh</malay> of the people or is it ghost or like <malay>jin</malay> in a form of people
<malay>jin</malay> or <malay>syaitan</malay> [lah] but is it
a really <malay>roh atau jin</malay> in a form of
[ah] <malay>manusia</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [sia]
for them
but
but I heard like actually burn money and burn hell notes is actually not burn <malay>rumah tu semua</malay> is actually not because of to have <malay>rumah</malay> for them and others right
it's actually to show that [ah] <malay>bila kita mati benda ni kita tak boleh bawa balik tak boleh bawa dengan kita</malay> or something like that
I heard from some people like that
is it
what if like life is like that [ah] then the <malay>miskin</malay> like got <malay>tak ada</malay> chance [seh]
you just imagine [eh] <malay>kalau kita macam</malay> the rich can buy a lot a lot a lot of special things to bribe <malay>orang dekat sana</malay>
I don't know you steal
maybe steal or maybe you kill people because people too demoralise you because you <malay>macam</malay> too depressed and you <malay>tak boleh</malay> happy tu cakap</malay> you it's like a lot story in the news that people <malay>bunuh orang atau bunuh diri sendiri</malay> because too stress and in every vision I believe in every vision <malay>atau</malay>
or maybe it's it's only islam that if if you commit suicide then it's the worse sin <malay>apa</malay>
it's one of the sin it's one of the sin [lah] so that's why I say <malay>macam</malay>
so even if <malay>kita kita tak ada duit pun</malay> it's part of
there's the the the the thing that we can do [lah] <malay>kita bunuh diri kita sendiri</malay>
<malay>kau bunuh</malay> people
okay imagine
okay imagine like husband and wife quarrel no money [what] you you [ah] yo <malay>hutang ni ni ni siapa nak bayar</malay> gets into the head <malay>dia</malay> stress <malay>sangat</malay> then <malay>macam</malay>
socked in the head then <malay>terus ambil lepas tu bunuh ada apa</malay> is it happens
but we don't know [what] like <malay>macam</malay> some people depression <malay>macam</malay> too too depressed they don't cannot find a way to to solve <malay>dia punya</malay> debts then they kill
their child then they kill themselves
then how you you want to answer that it's the same thing [what]
because you you cannot pay off your debts like at your wit's end like you lost hope everything
ya [lah] then like if that's the sin then you take people life you take your own life then if the people want to live how
ya [lah] then how to bribe
ya [lah]
but if you poor who want to bribe for you if you kill the person with you who want to bribe for you
(mm) islam is very fair in that
in the sense that
you are answerable for your own
#allah# is #allah# won't judge you once
<malay>amalan</malay>
a chance to
but sis can you imagine like for us that muslim [eh] let's say [lah] even if you have a chance <malay>syurga</malay> then if you still have to stay in <malay>neraka</malay> like you never know how long you have to stay in <malay>neraka</malay>
and one other story is like <malay>macam</malay> like sometimes it it gets to me <malay>yang macam</malay> [ah]
they say the first thing that will be questioned in <malay>alam kubur</malay> or in the hereafter is <malay>solat</malay> like if
if <malay>kau</malay> the first question like <malay>solat kau tak</malay> pass <malay>yang benda lain semua tak</malay> matter already
then it gets to me [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> then some people say like some <malay>mazhab</malay> say ya you no need to pay <malay>balik yang</malay>
the <malay>solat</malay> that you missed [ah] <malay>solat</malay> just <malay>solat taubat</malay> then you just try not to do it again
but some people some <malay>mazhab</malay> say you have to pay back after every <malay>solat</malay> like slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly
until <malay>kita mampus</malay> then I asked I asked some people [lah] let's say [kan] <malay>macam</malay> how are we going to know how many <malay>solat</malay> that we missed
like I cannot imagine like okay [lah] let's say <malay>kita daripada baligh baligh umur kita sebelas tahun habis</malay> that at times <malay>kita solat juga</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
repay [oh] maybe if <malay>tak</malay>
I I wanted to I wanted to ask [lah] if let's say <malay>kita</malay> because we are busy in this world [kan] kita <malay>kejar kejar kejar kejar</malay> sometimes we don't have time to <malay>qada</malay> [kan] so let's say in a sense that <malay>kalau aku tak solat qada kalau aku ganti dengan solat sunat boleh</malay>
like let's say like <malay>aku</malay> because of the missed prayer [kan]
then sis <malay>taubat</malay> so maybe <malay>macam</malay> sis <malay>susah nak tidur malam</malay> then the only time that I can wake up is <malay>pukul tiga pagi</malay> onwards [ah]
so maybe that's the time that like <malay>macam</malay> can be it <malay>macam</malay> not <malay>ganti</malay> [lah] like can it help or not
[kan] sis <malay>macam takut</malay> [tau] let's say <malay>macam</malay> I want to be prepared <malay>macam</malay> sis want best of both world I want <malay>macam dekat dunia dengan dekat akhirat</malay> so let's say <malay>macam kita dekat dunia macam ini</malay> [jer] <malay>macam macam kita dekat dunia ni dah teruk macam ini macam</malay> we are already bad <malay>dah dah macam ini dah teruk begini</malay>
<malay>kasi air</malay>
[a'ah] [lah]
ya just like the story <malay>yang yang</malay> the <malay>orang yang bunuh yang</malay> the ninety nine killer or something like that or <malay>yang yang bunuh berapa orang tu</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> repent
<malay>dia</malay> repent <malay>dia mati dia masuk syurga</malay> because the person say no he didn't <malay>belum</malay> he haven't [tau] <malay>taubat</malay> because #allah# take his <malay>niat</malay> as <malay>orang tu cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>engkau kena pasal dia yang dia nak bunuh dia punya yang</malay> first the first <malay>pergi dekat</malay> first <malay>ustaz ni</malay> he went there <malay>lepas tu ustaz tu</malay> say [oh] <malay>kau tak akan diampunkan</malay> [lah] <malay>kau dosa kau dah bunuh banyak orang ini semua</malay> something like that [lah] so he out of <malay>geram</malay> he killed the <malay>ustaz</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> kill the <malay>ustaz</malay> you know
so he went to
[ah] then he went to this another <malay>ustaz</malay> then the <malay>ustaz</malay> was saying [oh] [ah] <malay>kalau kau nak berubah</malay> if you want to be in a better place then you have to get out of your surrounding now move to another place <malay>macam tempat yang lebih baik</malay> [lah] so he [ah] <malay>kau pergi dekat sini kau belajar agama</malay> something like that
no this is another <malay>ustaz</malay> so he <malay>dengar apa yang ustaz ni cakap</malay> so he went to the other village or the other place but on the way to other place <malay>dia meninggal mati</malay> so <malay>bila dia mati tu terus masuk syurga</malay>
ya because <malay>niat dia</malay> because <malay>dia belum taubat lagi</malay> [tau] he <malay>tak tahu apa-apa</malay> because he just on his way to <malay>nak taubat</malay> to get out of the place then he already get to <malay>syurga</malay> so the main story is like maybe
maybe it's the <malay>niat</malay> that matters [lah]
<malay>tapi dah maki</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>tapi maki</malay> [jer] [lah]
so if you want to <malay>maki</malay> just <malay>maki</malay> [jer] [lah] [kan]
so I so I I thought I have this conversation [lah] so
moral of the story is all based on out <malay>niat</malay> [what] so if like #allah# decide on where we should go
because if if we were to be judged on our sins <malay>dengan kita punya</malay> doings and everything I think nobody in this world in these deserving of #jannah#
good person
sinners
sinners who repent
ya [lah]
plus point
<malay>tapi tak</malay> minus
<malay>dah ada</malay> stated there
<malay>dia tulis</malay>
so #allah# is fair like that #allah# love us in a way that way [lah] I think that's how I think islam to me islam is a very loving religion [ah] a very loving very empathetic
compassion
society
first thing society [ah]
<malay>islam</malay>
ya
I hope for that <malay>ustaz</malay> also yesterday that <malay>macam</malay> he's saying [lah] <malay>macam</malay> we should educate our child
that
that be modest <malay>penting</malay> is part of islam and all but <malay>kita pun kena ajar anak kita</malay> that you know doesn't mean that <malay>dia tak pakai tudung</malay> she is not modest enough
like we are not okay we have to teach our child like that because we have to teach our child <malay>macam</malay> what islam is all about since young and it starts from <malay>asar dia cakap</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>macam tak semestinya dia tak pakai tudung kau tak boleh kau tak boleh cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>dia tak</malay> modest <malay>dia bukan perempuan yang baik-baik</malay> it's not a good thing [ah] to me personally [lah] because <malay>pada kita agama kita kita punya amalan</malay> is all <malay>masing-masing</malay>
true
I think just now [ah] flying all my <malay>tudung</malay> then <malay>macam apa ni</malay> ten
#lam soon# singapore <malay>ke tadi</malay>
my expire date is thirty first july two years after this
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [eh] what
ya [lah]
perfect
ya maybe we
<malay>kita dah pernah kena</malay> judge [lah] that's why we don't we know how it is <malay>kalau</malay> people judge us
like sis <malay>pernah kena</malay> judge <malay>masa</malay> sis <malay>kerja dekat</malay> [ah] my previous workplace <malay>yang kat</malay> #tai seng# <malay>tu</malay> [kan]
[ah] I I <malay>apa</malay> after I started <malay>pakai balik tudung</malay> right
slowly [lah] I think after that <malay>dah dua tahun</malay> [ah] but it's still slow still new [lah] then <malay>masa tu</malay> [ah] I was judged by one of the co-workers [lah] <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>aku tak suka</malay> [ah] <malay>perempuan pakai tudung</malay> then I asked why [lah] then <malay>dia macam</malay> [oh] <malay>semua perempuan pakai tudung semua sama nampak</malay> [jer] <malay>baik</malay> but behind <malay>semua hisap rokok</malay> [lah] <malay>ambil laki orang</malay> [lah] I <malay>macam</malay> who are you to judge like <malay>macam</malay> just because <malay>satu orang buat kau nak</malay> judge <malay>aku macam itu</malay>
ya [lah] but it's not <malay>perempuan pakai tudung</malay> [jer] <malay>buat apa yang tak pakai tudung</malay> also <malay>buat</malay> [what]
so why are you judging just because we wear <malay>tudung</malay> wear <malay>tudung</malay> doesn't mean <malay>yang kita ni malaikat</malay> [what]
and then sis <malay>macam tak puas hati</malay> [lah] <malay>kena</malay> judge <malay>macam itu</malay>
you meet american union people start a
step <malay>baik</malay>
step good good
(hmm)
<malay>kurang ajar betul</malay>
what do you mean
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [sia]
ya [lah]
then if I judge all muslim men are or all religious men are <malay>semua pun macam tak betul</malay> how
ya
at first sis was like sis <malay>dah jadi</malay> defensive [lah] because all of this is something new to me
like at first my friends <malay>semua tak nak</malay> friend with me
because <malay>macam alim begitu</malay> [kan] she don't wan't to friend with me <malay>sebab</malay> she say [ah] <malay>kau dah pakai tudung</malay>
then <malay>buat apa kau kawan dengan orang jahat macam kita nanti kita buat kau jadi jahat</malay>
then I say to her [lah] <malay>tak semestinya</malay> that I wear <malay>tudung aku baik</malay> [seh]
I wear <malay>tudung</malay> is because I wanted
to
change for <malay>agama</malay> [lah]
like sis want to change like <malay>sampai bila nak jadi macam itu</malay> maybe if I wear <malay>tudung</malay> it will remind me to to to be modest
to proper to be more proper to <malay>macam jaga diri</malay> in public
like sometimes <malay>kita dekat</malay> public <malay>kita</malay>
you know like <malay>macam dulu</malay> I never wear <malay>tudung</malay> then sis <malay>pakai baju</malay> low cut and <malay>nampak macam niat kita tak nak tunjuk</malay> [tau]
our intention is not <malay>macam kita tak nak tunjuk pun</malay> but <malay>nampak</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> to me it <malay>elak fitnah</malay>
[a'ah] especially especially if you wear <malay>niqab</malay>
when you wear <malay>niqab</malay> right <malay>dia punya niat</malay> is to stay away from guys right to <malay>macam</malay>
stop getting attention from guys right but in these in this modern <malay>nya</malay> days if you wear <malay>niqab</malay> instead you attract more guys
wanted to know you wanting to know you ya because
you <malay>kau tak</malay> normal <malay>apa</malay> like people want to know how you look like behind those thing
(hmm) a lot of guys are <malay>macam itu sekarang</malay>
then because
<malay>masa yang si</malay> #nurul# <malay>tu</malay> [kan] then <malay>yang pakai niqab dulu sebelum dia kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>dia pakai niqab</malay> [kan]
(err) ex #hafiz#
not the ex one [lah] the girl that she's getting to know [lah] <malay>yang dah kahwin</malay>
when she wear <malay>niqab dia nampak cantik</malay> [lah] like you will imagine her to be a <malay>cantik</malay> girl so many girls are adding her [tau]
and she received a lot of from guys [lah]
<malay>memang semua gambar dia pakai niqab</malay> she is very she is wearing <malay>niqab</malay> [what] so she delete all her pictures <malay>yang tak ada niqab</malay>
so people added her
she gains more attention by that
[ha]
like nowadays that people want to know you because you wear <malay>niqab</malay>
no
no
for what
but sis don't want to be <malay>macam tu</malay> but sometimes
<malay>ada apa</malay> you know in malaysia <malay>ada satu perempuan ni muda dia pakai niqab</malay>
<malay>dia pakai niqab</malay> and then she's very young then <malay>macam nampak mata</malay> [jer] [kan] then she <malay>berbual</malay> very <malay>lembut</malay> very <malay>lemah lembut</malay>
[ah] then like guys are attracted to girls like that so people like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! <malay>lemah lembut</malay> then <malay>muka kau cantik</malay>
then I when I was having this conversation with #hafiz# I was saying like you know I don't sometimes I don't I feel like I don't deserve to wear <malay>niqab</malay> [lah] because the purpose of wearing <malay>niqab</malay> is to grown away <malay>daripada</malay> attention [what]
so if like <malay>aku pakai niqab orang tengok aku</malay> then <malay>lepas tu aku berbual</malay> <malay>begitu</malay>
because ya
but sometimes we tend to forget like sometimes you know <malay>kita dekat</malay> public [eh] <malay>bodoh</malay> [lah] like that
because sometimes when we wear <malay>tudung</malay> also our <malay>cara cakap</malay> also still the same [what]
so sis feel that
(hmm)
then
<malay>bila</malay>
(err) <malay>pakai pakai niqab</malay>
<malay>pakai niqab</malay>
you <malay>nak jaga macam mana nak makan</malay> then <malay>macam</malay> like sometimes when we talk to guys like
<malay>tak tak</malay> open <malay>masuk kat masuk kat bawah</malay> [lah] <malay>tarik ke depan sikit masukkan bawah</malay>
I tried [what] once then I feel like I cannot
but then I say [lah] because when I see a people a girl wearing #niqab# (err) I have expectation on them [ah]
then <malay>macam</malay> I say <malay>macam</malay> I hear <malay>perempuan pakai niqab</malay> I hear <malay>dia orang macam</malay> giggle <malay>macam gedik</malay> like I don't like
[a'ah] [lah]
maybe because I have unresolved issue with <malay>perempuan pakai niqab</malay>
ya because to me like I have unresolved issue <malay>macam</malay>
like #neelofa# [ah] <malay>macam</malay> #neelofa#
what to expect
react
then how to react
to certain things
so <malay>macam</malay> so
people <malay>lagi macam</malay> have a better understanding of islam
so if <malay>kau</malay> react wrongly people <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>orang islam macam ini</malay> [lah]
no wonder [lah] you know that kind of thing
that's my personal belief [lah] like I wanted to add [lah] that especially during timing right
to me like it's
wear
wear [ah]
then I've asked myself if I were to wear <malay>niqab</malay> then I have to forsake a lot of my clothes [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> to change my whole wardrobe
then if I have to change my whole wardrobe then I I ask I ask I say myself like <malay>macam</malay> if I have to change my wardrobe that means all these while when I was wearing #hijab# I am not wearing properly
that I'm wearing for the sake of covering [jer]
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
big
big build ya
ya
then how [ah]
so sis <malay>jawab apa</malay>
but actually to look presentable is also part of
religion
but then if we wear like that (err)
people will judge us name like <malay>makcik-makcik</malay>
because we will be looking so dull
(mmhmm) maybe we should maybe we should start doing that [lah] <malay>macam</malay> #neelofa# you know like
she change the misconception that <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>pakai</malay>
<malay>purdah mesti</malay> boring but if she change [ah] <malay>dia tak macam</malay> sparkling <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak macam</malay> there's bling <malay>sangat tapi macam elok jadi macam</malay> okay [lah]
still
<malay>tak nampak macam makcik-makcik</malay>
what's the word [ah] the the the
ya #ringarde# I don't want to be #ringarde#
but
ya [lah]
true [lah]
and the creator
ya so like
so if you that's why they say when you <malay>pakai benda ni</malay> you are sacrificing the things that women like most
like being fashion
being looking like
<malay>cantik</malay> [lah]
ya
then remember <malay>mak</malay> saying you know like when you want to wear <malay>niqab</malay> when you want to wear <malay>purdah</malay>
you shouldn't wear things that very bright
because you are attracting people like if <malay>kau dah buat macam gitu</malay> that is
you just want to
