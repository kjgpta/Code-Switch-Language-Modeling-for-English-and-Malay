orh but like of all the things a pirate ship ah that's like
that's like maybe what a the ten year old you will do or something uh

but I'm glad you I'm glad you thought it through lah huh
but you would think

then he was saying that he working at some burger place with a lot of angmohs
but the angmohs were like you're you're so cool
ya lah he working at some burger
on the arm
is that an actual thing I've never really heard of
that you could do it
uh huh
orh I know my friend recently she bought like
my friend recently bought a she bought a tattoo gun
so she's like
she's like experimenting on herself first before she
offers to do for people ah
brand tattoos for her friends that kind ah
and before she

ha
actually
ah like cupping
you know what's cupping
ya ya the one that they put the suction cup on your on your back
like holes into your body then after that they suck out the blood
so the way they poke is like they use like some
pen with a needle or something then they just like then they just poke through your entire whichever part lah
I think like this is what tattooing feels like ah
you see how it feels ah
like getting injections over and over again
okay lah I guess
maybe
but he was doing it quite fast ah
like really rapid
uh huh
uh huh
was that on impulse also or what
uh huh
uh huh
that your sisters what
oh ya ya

mm
uh huh
dude you remember or you don't remember
okay lah I guess it turn out for the better lah huh
well I just I just finished my reservist today also ah
never sia
then
it was to make up for the last duties mistakes ah more like it
ah
half was that half was
half was like
so they were
that was the other half lah the other half was
but ya other than that
err what time ah
like
uh ya
ya
orh
ah
sia
oh then my medical call
not bad ah
quite interesting ah
like
cause the the call when it came in right it said difficulty breathing
then my then my was like chill lah yes ah okay difficulty breathing probably it's like
but the call said cardiac arrest so we were like okay
then we just go there like
then we reached the lift lobby
then we got into the lift together
then we go into the lift together then we took up then then my my ask him
err are you the one who called just now then the guy was like ah ya ya
then I started asking him then he said ya he oh his brother then his brother collapsed
then we go inside
we go inside
the got two people
one to fight back and one was the community responder
like
then they were already set up they set up the put up a dismal already
then when I came
straight away the second shock given
which is uh pretty rare ah to to to see like shocks getting given by the ah
ya but the guy
uh huh
oh
orh but after the first two shocks after that no shock advised that you just keep pumping ah
I I think so
then
sorry what you say
see someone
for with a shock
oh
compulsory to what
oh serious ah
ah
uh huh
okay lah I mean
fair enough but also cannot really force also
but okay lah that guy quite nice the the community responder
cause he was at home ah he said
ya so he's the first person to reach
uh huh
ah
ah
so from from no breathing no pulse ah
oh ya that guy
uh huh
uh huh
confirm gone ah is it
uh huh
got the what again
ah the the one and two and three and four and that kind ah
ah
wait that was a doctor ah
it isn't you know
sian sia
who gets to do as in nobody want to do oh nobody wanna do
why sia
uh
huh
but uh
I was talking to the the guy who came back station also lah so he was saying that
cause
orh
ya so
I don't know how useful this thing is lah but like
no point
oh
so can what
huh
ah ya ya the ugly one lah
oh
ya ya
oh ya I ding was telling us lah
ya the guy was firefighter
it's the lah recall
ah
that is for firefighting or for the medic that side
oh
mm mm
okay ah
cause I came also like
then go up
but okay lah fire fight fire fight come first so
to us like not so
not so stress lah cause the guy do the access the all the stuff already
so we just like
I was the sec com ya
no lah but my is trained so it's not so bad
as in even if they don't we don't turn out as sec com still okay because
as in even if I came in with zero knowledge it's still okay cause my is trained
ya lah definitely sia
I like I mean like on paper it's the sec com take charge lah but
honestly most of the time it's really just the
the ah take charge
so like
but last time was to make up for manpower now it's for them to get experience and then go back to fire side to bring their experience over
ya so it's
but now makes sense ah
ya
and fire bike
high intensity what
what does it mean
is it a type
oh
uh huh
eight people
wah
oh
but wonder how often it's actually being used lah in
ah
ah
eh my friend from paya lebar also the madam told them don't turn out sia
they said they want to minimise
ah they the the madam told them don't turn out for call like for reservist
ah fire site
cause they want to minimize the exposure to the public
then
I suay ah my
ya sia
don't know ah apparently it's the first time ah that
only the
they said because of the or something ah
but I don't know ah not really buying it
okay ah bo pian ah just go ah
then they also all the all the people were like
so one five two replace one five two
so
one five two crew also turn out for
you get it
so I'm I am
so I am I'm one five one right
at the same time I am one five two
ya
ya
ya correct
cannot ya so either one either or one will turn out
ya so it's called double meaning ah
so like
ya lah so must just be extra alert
okay lah but as in bishan usually quite rare that something happens also anyway
not bad lah at least I got to experience a medical call
like it
okay lah interesting interesting
I mean at least if ever really I come to a
ya
practice and practical
but to actually see it happen in real life
like different sia
what didn't you download the app
ah
uh huh
I think for you all different lah cause like your whole entire duty already doing that kind of thing
but for people who not
like not doing that every single day then I think it's okay ah
download what
oh no lah I don't even have my
cert for that one
I don't know I I think you need the cert right to at least go for those calls
ya then
oh the card ah
oh for a as a reservist ah
but do you actually go for the training and stuff
like the recourse
uh huh
uh huh
what did I what did I teach you
oh
why did I
have you actually used the hiemlich on anybody before
uh huh
oh I was reading on Reddit right
hello can you hear me
hello
ya ya
you got disconnected ah
oh ya our
I was reading on Reddit right like
got people who like
MPTY-
choked to death because they were too embarrassed to ask for help to hiemlich
like
I don't know ah
some thread that the they were they were out like a first date or something and then one of them started choking
so instead of asking for help right they go to the toilet to try to solve it then they just die in the toilet
ya
so then
uh huh
uh huh
that one they are not choking already ah
huh
ha
in case anything happen like just cover your back ah is it
orh
oh so she wanted to go to the hospital ah
huh
something lah you feel like you are contributing it ya
oh
ha
huh
so you were already were were you there on the scene already ah for this
that was that was was that you
orh wasn't you ah ah
wah yesterday they were telling me like
err ghost stories that happened in the station and stuff
ya ya that one that one
then
ya then the another one they said after that but it's only one more thing that happened
then after that so it was three of them
then you know that have you ever to the firefighting store
that you can close
ah so like
they closed the door but they didn't close it shut it was like ajar a bit
so it's just like they close ajar
then after that
that was from their perspective but from the guy inside the room right his perspective right
it's that he was
then he like
which is like cause it's ya as it's it's it's like a two floor kind of place
then which doesn't make sense because
but he climbed downstairs
then door open then he like he told them ah what he saw
then the two people outside like eh
but we didn't even close the door sia we just like we just held it ajar
ya that's the
as my my my call
second hand stories so it's like not so scary
ya
then what you doing tomorrow
ah
uh huh
oh so you buying for yourself lah
orh
ah
oh
ya I
I realised right I have this thing where I get headaches in the sunlight
no serious like cause when I started my internship last time my internship was back in twenty eighteen kan
then I I was having headaches like every week
then recently when I started work again
then I got the same kind of headaches
then I realised like
oh shit the only difference is that
the the only similarity is that I've been working in the sun
ya
err
okay so my second thought is that I think when I went for lasik
then
after that it somehow
made me get this thing
cause I was googling it's called photo

okay lah all's good all is good so
how
um
err for me
I guess is like
okay lah lesser
customers
but
so it's so hard for people to no be able to listen then it's like I try to raise my voice but then I feel like
so how other than
work how else is the pandemic
ya lah rilek ah okay water break
but ya I think uh one of my pet peeves I guess is
kan like what's the point bro you sneeze from your nose not from your mouth so you cover your mouth for what
and
mm
you know
so it's just just from her face
like a gangster seh but then
okay uh were there other people that felt the same way as you
um
um
um
ah so like two face
just marker
I think uh
because
you know for what ya so so it's just like
maybe
some of them are okay jer
but it's just you know it's just a stupid reason for me to just like ah
ya it does
ya ya ya ya
ya but but this is why I guess
we
as millennials I guess or gen Z or whatever okay you you millennial right because you are older
ya but
because we we put ourselves online
you know even especially this recording is also online ya so
ya precisely
actually is good for you to hide yourself like you know on social media especially
um if you do want to
go on dating apps
I suggest you can use a different name
well technically but like at least is still obvious right
okay that one K K K okay that one case lah but like ya that one that one is like but ya I got see a lot of people
on Tinder also oh okay say they put in their bio like
hi I'm actually seventeen or like fifteen then I I just straight away report they just fake their birthday lah but straight away we report lah because it's like
just imagine if
um a police read or something for some reason and then it's like they ask oh why you talking to a minor and then just like
I feel like we doing podcast but ya well
um
for example you are from a royal family or something or you are someone very very important you know ah ya sia but then ya it depends on the situation but
ya
you going to get bitten
um
Maggi Maggi cup jer
which one is it the indomie one
karma wow
I wonder what they serve
trauma in karma
but then I heard uh
okay lah I just google lah just now they have no menu so how ah
I feel like
it will be a full course meal starting from
starters appetiser and then all the way until dessert
sorry I never go restaurant before but
ya either way ya it's like the seven levels of hell basically I feel like
ya
but ya if if karma were to serve me something right it will be
revenge I feel like
from
lek ah lek lek lek lek lek
uh it's just
because back then in school ah now I working full-time already lah ah so
uh I made a lot of enemies because somehow some way people just don't like me and is like is like some kind of an algorithm
for at the end at the end of every school year right I will lose all my friends
ya ya well I don't know if I lose to them or they lose to me lah but
either way is this
ya I still remember one occasion
ah secondary school
but ya because like oh my god first major exam so like you expect people to at least
just
but then well ah long story short
it's just a
when I
that night where err
whether now so
you know like those kind err high school sweetheart kind of thing it's a no from me
oh shit okay no no
and then
ya so after that
uh so I guess on that night we just decided to be together to be in a relationship not me and my best friend my and the guy so
so somehow right the next day
his girlfriend is me then I was like who sia who spread and then obviously the first person that I suspected was not even my best friend you know that was how much I love her I want to say like but that sounded a bit
ya but then then ah
um before me and the guy
err talk right
he like another girl and
ya so
ya secondary school anything can happen so
err I talk to my best friend lah and say like oh why who who do you think spread and everything then she like ah I don't know you know everything then I was like ya true I also don't know because the thing is that I somehow I was too dumb to realise that she was also in that call yesterday lah like I didn't remember that fact
you know and then
ya that's true sia
that's why okay that's why you know the phrase where
some some people do say that oh I prefer befriending those on ya ya ya
some of them is like that because they will act like everything is just like oh hi let me ask guy best friend first
some of you all you just don't try to act innocent when you're not lah
ya
but
but that's why for me is that I prefer
how do you ah say I prefer
um
ya ya ya ya ya
um
ya but ah I got I got those kind of friend before I just drop
ya
eh ya I want off topic sia but okay your turn your turn I I go I go back jurong lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
example
check out rhythm skins in latin
who knows
ya but
ya I guess karma is technically revenge lah but not from the person itself but it's just from the world
ya mmhmm thanks
ya I guess um
if okay if you okay for example if you were the restaurant yourself if you were karma yourself what would you do
for supper
not for yourself lah not so bad lah for for anybody that you feel like
I guess
okay
mmhmm
in what sense
oh bro is is he living up to the quote of like every great woman is there's a great man behind or something I know it's the opposite lah but
but let's say
ah then that means
dude
do you feel like they are insecure of themselves when they say that kan um
um
um
mmhmm
ah ya my ex also did that
um
to a certain extent
or snobbish also
exactly in twenty twenty please get therapy
ya
even
okay this one I cannot brain
women also the same what
I guess in a sense
um um
ya because I feel like we
we don't have to mansplain stuff
right is that the word
so we okay if we say that oh my god I was
I don't know ya it's just a bit only not asking for much
I the self-proclaimed resting bitch face basically
ya like very edgy in a sense
no lah you normal lah
yes
but then for her is just
it was very hard to try to make her open up as in not open up to her secrets or whatever it's just talk to me like a normal person that's it and then it came to the point where she became clingy at first for me I I she said that I was clingy because I was trying too hard to become her friend but then I was like
err
and then after that
and then like oh how I wish I was in your group then I say oh ya same how I wish I and my friend were in my group but at that point of time I already started this liking because the way she was being very possessive and jealous over me even though we were just friends ya
um ya precisely unless you're married lah that one I think
a bit can
it's
ya
okay we're just single lah that's why we talk about this
ya but maybe for me is just I don't like the way you text so bye bye
so okay I I got I always ask this question if if you had three wishes
what
will you do with it I mean what would you wish for lah you know you know like those eleven eleven kind of thing
true I agree
so okay if everything was free how will you obtain those materials
forming oh farming how do you farm an iphone
ya how
what
okay she she living in thirty thirty one can farm an iphone
well I guess but we need a lot of land though singapore don't have a lot of land how ah
get a rooftop
then for the next wish okay other than the first wish will be everything will be free second
oh
wish
so explain your comfort characters um
ya anime anime ya
can you imagine he just pop up and just answer you
I see okay so
maybe you should manifest some cash
okay so what what
okay so secondary wish is your comfort characters third wish
oh that's cute
okay if if your cats were to talk right okay for all your cats that you have
how would you
how how do think they will they will talk to you for example gizmo
what do you do
give them a character ya ya ya ya ya
okay then your other cats
do you think she will be like the queen bee of the school
okay ya got some people just like that like
ya some some people are just naturally very attractive but
ya they very nice
ya maybe she'll be like what your big sister kind of character that will be cute
am I I I I guess maybe
and then okay your other cats
you live with them what that's why I'm asking you
oh that's cute alah
oh damn
I see okay I see
mmhmm
what
ya
okay lah makes sense mmhmm
something like a lot of
but is a cat a lost kitty
ah
ah okay lah at least um
dear you still have gizmo I know you you sure gizmo a lot
and and and
mmhmm ya ya her name is baby
damn okay
ah okay how how you take a cat home
in the carrier wow the love ya
ah
cute
so does she give more or does she want more attention
ah kan
no you you can have more cats than you know than more boyfriends so
and it's and it's and it's socially acceptable
okay what at least you're not spending money on someone who who can cheat you know which cat would cheat on you
right most to most is just get fat that's it
it's fine I can always you know help you
ya get
get I don't know get scratched I guess no the thing is I like cats but
sometimes I'm afraid to approach them
I mean you live with them
ah
how then the cat never fight back
ah that's true trust on trust
yes if you don't trust there's nothing nothing will happen so many things
ah that's true true like if animals were to like you except for insects
no thanks that one a bit sus
no we got a problem officer
so okay between cats and dogs
okay
I was thinking of something but okay thanks
why in what sense
that's
oh
um
mmhmm
okay that that makes sense but you know about the law where they they are forbidding people from having cats in
ya ya but demonising but ya it's just I feel like it's unfair because
for from my perspective right cats
they are cleaner and they are they make less noise the most to most they are meows are just very soft
when they run around
damn okay
so so animals are like that also okay
ya
ya sial ah who who ask you ghost
ya
but
ya I got around my neighbourhood if I do see the big dogs they are fine they are chill it's just the small dogs I don't know for some reason they just want to approach you like don't don't
ya
glass panel
is the one at the door right the gate right
specific eh
because you angry
what why wah so specific what you do sia
ya
ah mmhmm
uh huh
I don't I don't understand sia like I feel like they they have some kind of hate or anger inside them to the point where they can just hate so much
okay ya that's right
but but if you are below one five zero that one is a different kind of temper honestly
serious
ya because it's all compressed
ya it's all compressed so if you are ya if you are power
ya that's all the short guys don't date short guys
from experience maybe it's just a stereotype please don't take this too hard
well okay
I wish I had a cat
but I feel like
I don't know I'll be so emotionally attached to it
I don't know I I emotionally attached to a lot of things for example my water bottle or whatever is it can be quite toxic ya mmhmm don't make me sound so old please
so so it's like
nah I'm not single I'm I'm I'm single but not ready to mingle okay but
but ya ya I think I'm those kind of grandmothers I think like with the family heirloom that I just I just pass pass down my granddaughter my bottle that she cannot do anything about it she sell also people will just realise it's just a normal bottle that's not much value
well gen gen Z gen zentiment
okay lah I guess ya that would be our labels from society right like gen Z and just ah strawberry generation lah all those kind of shit
but things are done what
like everyone is struggling in their own things it's I don't know
yes
yes
precisely
of course they can lah the competition not that much
ya
mmhmm
ya
I I agree but because because it's true because I mean everyone is facing the same thing no matter how how much of
how much pressure that are getting lah so very little or what I mean I feel like
the future generations will also feel more pressure because there will be
too many things happening at once especially the pandemic now like
are home based learning okay lah a lot of people struggling especially those who
are either starting their first year of like you know or poly just ah tertiary education or like even
on their last year of school
it's just like
it's a very ah ya I don't know what to do kind of thing
content morning but game is a
um
so it what it's saturday sunday just
ya I mean for school I understand but for work
uh huh so so
by monday to friday so she had like rush it through and
damn
I'm just amazed at the fact that okay I mean sure working throughout the weekend but who has a meeting at ten until one okay maybe makes sense because timezone ya
but still
ya
well
okay other than school
but I feel like ya well
we all trying our best lor so
you know they were like like what you said just now like oh I did back in my days it was easier and then like now is just like there's so much competition there's so much you know if you want to study for example nursing a lot of people are taking nursing now because of the pandemic and then ah you know like now even the tourism industry is just basically dead
you know like err ya and then like it's it's just sad because
so much time wasted so many people getting retrenched and everything
I mean at least we get to you know some of us maybe we are from like
ah from our business background then we go into like
medical background or like vice versa you know that works also
but I don't know how it will play out after
how many years lah I feel like
it will stay for quite long
getting
no no it's just about the world we we never mention any ya
ya but but also like culture wise you know like I feel like there's still this thing about tattoos and going around
ya and I thought that you know at work it was like some kind of offense you know with the law that oh you cannot have tattoos but then when I ask around is just is just the culture
or any kind of physical ah body modifications I was about to say mutilations
ya but
it's nice oh especially it's just weird that
you know if you go to poly university can colour your hair you can do whatever but then like
ya brown dark brown
slightly dark
ya but hmm that's it
it's just chicken that has been un-raw
ya
I mean it's not it's it won't affect
you know it's just
ya
ya and it's as long as you do your work you do your part that's fine you don't have to like oh because she got she got tattoo lah he he got piercings ah you know he got piercings on the eyebrow and then just like how is that distract you you just don't look ya that's it
ya but I just hope
how to say I guess our generation we have things to look out for right
ya
ya and hopefully all the other things happening will be great lah right right

okay how was your day
you have to go to work tomorrow right
in the morning kan
ya
in the afternoon not in the morning lah
mm
production meeting eh
prepare for the production meeting at the the details eh
ya
ya bit busy month
but traditionally it's the busiest month for you right
traditionally for the past
twelve thirteen years right the demand december november december but not this year right because of COVID right ah
I see
what time will you be back do you think
okay cause I need to prepare lunch
and I want to I think the kids will definitely want
to eat the fish with you lah the
I don't I think for you is best to eat
so it's best to
to cook the heavy meals for lunch
why
ya
stretch the food even further the food we have lah
so I also don't want to waste food ah okay so tomorrow then you have to continue your work but you be working from home right you'll be studying from home right
the details ah
why take so long you still have to do research is it for each slide
that sounded like writing right it's almost like writing what
but you didn't put that much effort when you were write
I have to edit the what your write your your your what your article is is it your your assignment
two three pages but you know it's like
not it's not so bad it's not so badly done I mean I'm not trying to say you did it quite badly but
there's this lady a friend lady of his who was sharing a video she was singing a song
err who I don't remember the title keep on loving you or something like that
then I it's like eh that's not the famous song from tokyo square
it's all because of you you know that song
I'm feeling sad and blue so they use that melody but the tokyo square turned it into a song I think using the lyrics they sing it ah
so tokyo square actually that
it's not a a got a tokyo square concert but they perform a few songs ah
uh because there are many other things that err at that show so tokyo square was one of them so I I I remember tokyo square but the song that that was famous I was telling victor the word tokyo slot square is famous for this song called within you I remain is it within you remain or something like that
to america right they don't have
it's not like it's but this this is like one of the few ones that many people
will remember because you know they would want he went there
no because he liked the melody and he and I said the melody is actually from a japanese song very very I think is sukiyaki ah from what I know
that's the that's the unique thing lah that he was like
have you heard the song within you I remain ai ni</mandarin I love you
it's very famous ai ni</mandarin I need you
put us somewhere then she brought me with her lah so I think one of that that's why she know tokyo square
uh
they had this show they had this
ah so you remember lah
mm
uh the open space then they put up err the stage right eh um but you like some of the local music scene right it's like some of the songs right
there were some songs that you like what
uh
sam willows
uh
is there a song baby jane eh
uh
four
ah
uh
uh
ya because they're singaporean like like
the the drama series actors compared to the chinese err medium right like the malay medium
err have this problem even english medium you know where they're not professionals now the amateurs right they have a real professional job at the side
at at a real professional job and they do singing or they do acting
uh on the side line lah it's like the a full time job for them
uh
I mean actually added actually actually them the I'm actually say it's the
is the the talent right
he was able to
we're going to malaysia because he did so many
he did so many wonderful songs I mean I cannot imagine
like a lot of the a lot of the songs like that if he did was famous what
ya
ah ya the malay medium lah but it's like some of the
singapore hong-kong talent that went into chinese medium also like kit chan
at that she because she performed for cats even cats ya
ya
ya
not really a band not ya like but there is a talent lah like like the singapore talent ah
nuradi nuradi nuradi is a ah ya singapore talent
ya ya ya
astro eh
I don't otherwise director of astro guy so a lot of the malay talent they
he brought he brought over singapore malay talent bring over to malaysia
so they have this err
not fantastic lah not like ah zizan razak though
no I think
it's only people like ah zizan zizan eh
they are more exposure ya
the theater lah that the malaysia that we went to to watch the nadrah right
I remember when M nasir was talking to a
err hady eh hady mirza
for the
err what's the talent show eh
err M nasir so err hady mirza because I also don't have astro but I watch on youtube lah I I I I watched through
they need to create that rivalry I think on purpose lah
it's a draw ya
so ya it was
quite I think err err M nasir asked him err hady where have you been
because he was err wondering what he wasn't he was straying away from
for work err
is he forgotten ya
ya
ya that is the problem eh
like zoe tay and that time zoe tay was the were the in she was really the talent like pan ling ling
oh
her association
no I said if you want to go you can go with
no at that time lah
ah
pass away already eh
pass away eh
retired lah
how does it look like
oh
pointed out ah
as in he's still
actually I feel kind of sad that my teachers are retiring I don't know for some reason why
I just
or or even when peter bush was saying I felt so sad cause I was like what I felt that they could go on and on no forever and then retiring make me feel sad I don't know for some reason it just makes me sad
you know
ya
they say they are no longer they are no longer
you know but I thought that they will be like okay like for example I thought peter bush would want to be a professor you know you want to climb the
she's just tired you know
and um
I think that's the main reason why they retire
eh even at that time they were complaining about the millennials right
they both of them have the same complaint
the millennials are so
no we're not we are not we are post millennial we are not millennial
millennial until thirty nine oh for you you are millennial I'm not sia
I'm a nineteen seventy nine
uh I am a generation X leh
it's really the you lah but you are not the the the the people that seroja and borshak was saying lah
the they were saying that this millennials ah lazy you know lazy ah
ya
ah
because I think more than half of her salary she was putting away for the house
no she said people the
so
I think ten years eh twelve years or fifteen years ago
and she said she cannot even err make any profit
err around the same price as seroja
uh uh
uh
slightly more lah or around the same price lah
because she already bought a she already got err her flat
err her not her flat her condo at amber at amber road
she want to because she love err cycling
I think she wants to cycle near the beach lah she doesn't have to
uh
ya lah but she has wonderful legs ah
in amber road
started paying already so she doesn't need there's no hurry
I think around uh ten years or so ah
no she was the first owner
you mean the amber road or the one at
the amber road eh
the amber road I'm not sure maybe ah
I think I I don't think is a new condo ah
uh uh
uh it's new it's new
uh
she cannot move in
she still have to stay
and not having to borrow money from the bank
it's a very sexy you know what the view that because you can see the pool when you enter her her living space
when you enter her living room and then when you go her bedroom directly in front of the the pool in the centre of the pool
oh my god sex heaven
condo kan
it's very very nice
uh
because I thought I I thought she stayed at serangoon garden then then suddenly she went over so that one I don't know that story I don't know
uh uh
I don't know I think she definitely made a choice
huh
I don't think it's sponsored
but I can ask lah
but it's like I think for europeans is not really
especially french so I think it's something that they
uh
I mean I can't ask that question
but
but she's very err thrifty lah sia
rent eh
uh
I think it's two or three of them I think it's two of them in the room
ya
mm
that's why she move uh
make sense right
I know chile said she say she live in a condo because she said that she had her pool is always in front there but she never used so there's to me it's fixed condo lah
uh
uh
uh
so they are a bit different lah their their the way they
their upbringing is different right
uh distinction lah uh
ya
they don't from what I observed right they don't necessary have the best grades I remember when I was in school
I mean
having coming from a middle class or upper middle class
will give you a distinct advantage yes but not necessary so lah
uh
they do have the advantage but you know ya resources but they not necessarily the best lah the best usually not them lah
uh I I mean I remember I had this german coursemate near terrace eh
she he ya
ya
he went to eton know that was his socialization tau
oh I uh my father owns a travel agent company
uh
uh and then
uh
uh huh
they paid five hundred dollar a month
just to teach one subject
uh
this is doing you know
ah
but you know he was so sweet because you know that
I I found out that he was educated at eton so I was like eton then dasha was telling me I want to teach russia russian language to err the people in eton but the person who taught them was a professor of russia language and he is not a native russian speaker
but he's a very fluent russian speaker
so he teach the eton boys err russian lah
eton is like the boarding school
in in there's a boarding school
you can count on your finger who will
you know will do russian
ah ya
uh
uh huh
by russia ah no uh but uh
ya and and and the thing is is not just uh it's not just vietnam but also uh indonesia
indonesia and malaysia a lot of their medical students
err study in russia because russia uh uh study medicine in russia
I told you about this malay girl who studied russian I don't know whether she singaporean or malaysian
but the she's actually a medicine student in a medical student in russia
and is she she took a year ah to brush up on her russia before she
for medicine is relatively cheaper than you go to or america uh it's recognise lah
there's this girl I thought singaporeans but when err kacha was telling me kacha the owner of the school she was telling me when she was in going to sarawak or sabah
uh
huh
money
ah
malaysia hospital recognize
uh
but she cannot come and work here
uh
uh rundy his sister she studied in ireland right
no ireland not scotland
ah
ah
ah ah
to send her daughter to australia
the pace of life is different lah
uh uh laid back
she told me that
aiyo kartini what you think is so serious and important here over there is like
so laid I mean this is sofiani who finish his
paper like one week or two weeks earlier before the deadline you know this guy and he said that we really went over to australia he just learn how to be so laid back that he doesn't really care but I know
sofiani will find it very difficult to not care lah you know
ya he will care a bit but maybe not as much as before
ya
ya
I know your auntie have to challenge with
challenges with the egypt and jordan right
right with the girls right but the guys are the ones studying local
you know ahmad ahmad stays here
ahmad was like when he switched to secular right
adi secular
ah same as ahmad right
oh
ya
strength
their strength is languages uh
ya
ya
soci is hard to get it also
you have to do aptitude test leh
ya but we we found out from my
err university of
jordan and the university of
not cairo lah err al-azhar
al-azhar
al-azhar
uh it's not they say it's not a degree level you know
they don't consider a degree for al-azhar a degree
uh
don't know allahu aalam
uh
uh
ya
uh wani eh
unless they do online lah unless they do online lah but I don't know al-azhar now not that good lah
the system of learning ah
err I think ever since the the egyptian spring ah uprising ya arab spring
you know syria attack but syria always so they will always be the attack are you know right until the end of time lah we know that the story lah
oh now she didn't go with them she went to the jordanian embassy right
and then she got a rolex watch she was showing it off at the facebook
nothing from this this girl this lady you know
can just give to the poor people but I think for him is like a simple gesture
to everybody who work for the embassy on the singapore side
uh but at that time this is before the trace translator for the hospital this is after that so when after that
she decided to because this one did the sponsorship for the translator need to come from somewhere right so after that there's no funds for them right then she and then she move on to she move on to or she got another job
err at the
uh
err visa at the jordianian embassy ah
modern standard arabic it's a very formal language
that comes off from the quran lah you know it's like
you know but the thing is if it true people speak their dialect so the the what the dialect all the dialect they are a bit different from the fusha
that's the that's the thing lah so they get whatever they can
uh they can throw that at your face
you know but that is the the the nature lah but then you want to get the sadat eh they call it sadat you you want to get sadat so you do that lah
let her just stay here lah let her she said if her strength is science then let her go to science let her go to poly like her
uh
language is a bit hard lah
but she might she might change her mind because I wasn't very good either my language isn't very good either
we're looking better and better when I was you know
uh
I think from what I know in singapore
you do very well if you do science says at your computing you know you do very well
languages not really our core strength ah
uh I mean I have friends who who like for example murni and I have a mutual friend
err okay lah one of our girlfriends lah
so I'm not that close to her lah because
I mean I don't have to worry about it until
uh
err
what what what she mean actually she mean err

thursday
can she Google whether any provided result beside kaplan
no lah I mean
we went to kaplan to register her
oh different uni
don't you think with his diploma in kaplan can she use that or not
to for the bridging oh no you cannot then you have to go this
ah
ah
it's exam-based also lah I mean written written exam
how many choices she have
but
line kan must be the same line cause
you cannot change
courses eh
ya I mean with this combination diploma
but the course is this
whether she want to consider that
cause if she want to choose what she want if you have to take exam she have to take exam lah kan
no choice
or she will open with non-examinable but different course
now is december
mm
orh
but part time will be what how many years three years
orh
but what is different if she's a part time students and full time student what benefit
her
orh
ah
then she's no more ah means she's tertiary student what
hmm
like I said if the the thing is whether the diploma kaplan diploma is recognised or not for all of these other uni
ya
this one is uh this one the
ah bridging ya
so you must have that diploma
at first it's was ya
it's just is it good to sit with her I thought you must go to to the school with the
ya
mm
but I mean does it change if
do you think also the same thing they might have new course new ones new courses
not very confident
the thing is when you go outside
is different
how you carry yourself
if you don't
practise what you were supposed to practise you go outside
that's the things lah kan whether you can be safe or
don't know what's going on
so that's why you have to explore okay with this diploma
one more year one more the amount you have to pay on it ya
don't waste timing
I said to him can that one is your pastime not your professional time
that depends on his portfolio
mm
so
there's something to do with maths also in in in photography
think cannot pause is it have to talk all the way is it until end
wah there's twenty more minutes to talk next subject
speaking about SAM uh
maybe if you open for english the franchise fee
I don't know you need to find out lah kan
samuel
that uh
pick up a teacher just do for english then if the teacher say okay you willing to come this time this time this time or not ah then if everything okay then okay lah kan
cause if they use two classes that means no place for us to sit around already cause the class

vague
cloudy ya ya you can use the word cloudy because it's err
ya it's
cloudy is dark
yes so that song goes like old macdonald had a farm right so
ya
I had to stick out two of my bloody pointy fingers and put it on my head and pretend I'm a cow that was really traumatising for me lah
yes ya
ya but at the same time I was very you know as a as a kid right the the thought of being embarrassed is not
there yet you see
in front of people
and then after that the
so
ya ya you were you were it
I remembered that then the next memory that I had quite vividly
okay make sure you don't that that memory don't okay lah the word is forget ladies and gentlemen um
manufacturing

this was another traumatising part err on my end
I guess so ya I guess so
oh ya ah we were kids we were
just stop lah like whoa
ya but you know
right
hmm oh my god
forced that's the word
you know what I felt the same way about you
and

so last time when I watch hulk eh last time eh uh series eh they no no no nothing
ah there was actual visual
I like uh I like the the series very much ah those days ah

and ah for me I like adventurous and not so violence ah
I like adventurous ah and then also
I like to watch fairy tales movie
uh as well like cinderella
snow white
uh I think
uh I I prefer to watch this this kind of fairy tales ah
uh
ah should be no problem ah kan
uh I I think uh
ah we can go there what
ah
I can try baby pool first ah
or you can try deep pool also what
ah I I I think I think we can try ah swimming
you can try your skills
no it's it's quite uh no uh wasted tau
if you you know how to swim you better use use your skills
correct not so this time round you can use the deep pool don't worry lah maybe can we we we we can try slowly
alright then after that you can uh sharpen up your your your your swimming your swimming skills
then after that we can go east coast
ah
so east coast you were to go deeper or you want to go to the shallow
uh and then how how uh and then how you get how you got the way how you run away
he carried you ah okay lah so so
oh but then
uh you sounded not okay lah but then end end up okay ah
okay lah should be no problem lah
so so so hopefully so uh you what's that in sec one sec two you you had
uh several
uh practices kan ah I think should be should be okay
ah
practice
ah
ah
so if you go to east coast maybe we can take a shallow one ah
ah slowly
ah so gradually we can we can really do lah correct or not
I mean it's a waste ah
you can uh we will just we we we we send you to go swimming
uh swimming courses and then after that end up
you cannot swim I mean you are afraid to swim ah

mm
mm

mm

orh
mm
mm
mmhmm
actually kan for the safety of everyone eh actually I got twelve people in the same group you know
mm mm
mm
really orh hor
mm
that time you not so careful anymore to be honest lah like let's be real eh
mm
a'ah
mmhmm
mm
I don't think that's going to work in fact
mm
mmhmm
ya
good luck to you eh
uh uh I'm like
at this point I don't know whether he's trying to make it funny ah
if I can if I can make you smile by making this funny why not
ya that little spark of happiness you know

it's so long since I've seen you
so how are you
oh really
how is it
oh
so ya because like I I wanted to go uni right but I didn't get in so I will try next year but for now like I need to find a job so is quite difficult lah because of the pandemic also it's like uh it's like very limited with the jobs so hmm
oh ah cashier job
oh that no that one temporary I mean they did ask me to extend lah but I it's not something that I want to do for like a long term you get what I mean ya ya cause like cause I work you know at there right like as the cashier so have to deal with like a lot of like like for you lah your one is also elderly right then
ya we also have to deal with a lot of elderly like for example like ah we got we got the you know the senior senior discount right on like certain days so I think it's ya no no no it's uh like uh for the elderly citizens like those sixty years old and above right if they buy their groceries on like for example wednesday they get a discount
ya so that's why I'm not working there anymore because it's quite difficult
right oh really ah
as in she working oh
oh
ya eh she working as cashier also ah mm
um I think I got make like a few mistakes lah once because I was just new what then I like had to do the cashier all by myself right because usually at the start right they the aunty will be beside you to help you so like after like a few weeks right then ah you have to do the cashier part alone
so ya then I got make a few mistakes like like something to do with the money lah I mean ya then after that uh the manager and the supervisor didn't scold me so I guess that's good like they were very nice about it ya even though it was ya
ya lah we need to pay back ya we need to pay back but like below five dollar don't need to pay back but if above five dollar need lah ya but so far never ah
oh ya got this one point of time when I was just new then like I was doing with the aunty lah so apparently like I think I miscalculated leh then got like a shortage of like ten dollars you know like ten dollars or more
ten dollars more ya because I think was fifteen dollars so five dollar offset right and ten dollars she need to pay well I I was supposed to pay ah cause I think I was the one that did the mistake lah then after that my aunty insist that she will pay for me so I felt so touched by her ya because they they're all very nice there ya ya I think it depends on the outlet lah
ya
oh my god
ah so nice luckily the uncle
so ya I don't know if it's like some of them may be on purpose or what lah but okay maybe there are others who really not on purpose then sometimes the card will have a error like they will say try again or payment not accepted or something so that means
ah pay on the spot right then the machine cannot use like ya so that's why is like we have to be like attentive lah also but also some of the customers like I think ah some of them are like purposely like never pay then they just walk off ya
ya ya cause some some of like okay lah the one that time cause I work with sophia right then she had to pay like how much ah eighteen dollars like she had to pay ya because the customer walk off then like she cannot find a customer
ya ya luckily only eighteen sia imagine if the person buy like hundred dollar plus or what wah that one is like is like one week pay leh
oh ya okay I wanted to talk about the the ya wait what's her name fadreena is it fadreena so you met her from right the try out
hmm
oh no okay wait so my friend ah I don't know if you know her lah is she's the one that wear the hijabi she I mean hijab the she's my secondary school friend lah
so apparently she and the fadreena they are in the same course I believe it's ya same course but they are not classmates lah so apparently uh my friend she went to japan that exchange program with the school right
then after that the few the next few days kan um the fadreena was like getting close to my friend's friend so like there were times when they would just like she would like go into the hotel room right
then like ah the japan trip also like she was the fadreena was like very like I don't know like the vibes of her was very off and then like they cannot click because I think also fadreena like I don't think you know her much lah but her personality quite strong
ya then there was this one point of time I think they were like making fun of each other lah fadreena and my friend then because ah then like she they I mean she said something hurtful about my friend like say uh I forgot what ah
very bad from then then ah oh ya recently cause that time I met with her so the my friend naziha right she said like the fadreena sent her a long long text
saying like um what ah why you go around behind my back saying about me and all that when the last time they talk right was like two years ago because that that the the japan trip was like two years ago mah
so from then my from then on right my friend never talk to her because like obviously like they can they cannot click right so why would she talk to her right so ya and then suddenly like very recently she ask she just sent that long text ah of like why you talk behind my back then my friend also like huh I also never talk behind your back for what then also because she got like a boyfriend right I think I don't know is
ya
ya I mean like I don't know like so pretentious the vibe

but like he already he

like I think she he cannot move on from her lah then the ex also is like now quite successful already so he's uh working under certis cisco then his pay quite good lah from what I see
then he say like I have everything now but I don't have you so like the only thing that I'm I need is you then my friend also like uh like contemplating lah cause like she when she was with her ex for like two years when he was in so now she has to start back from square one
hmm ya
mm ya ya ya
mm
ya
ya
ya true
no cause like uh I mean she likes the guy currently lah I mean she really loves him from what she say but because the guy also must like I don't know why but she she keeps comparing the current with the ex like the way they were in well when they were in lah so like apparently the current one right now is not giving like uh how to say ah like
uh my friend right she gave a lot the guy like as in like efforts lah not not as in like um money or what but like giving like effort like making handwritten letters and all that and then um buying him chocolates and all then but then um the guy never really like

then also the guy also like um doesn't like he doesn't really spend much on her I mean even though he's lah but like most of the meals right she have to pay for herself ya so that's why she feel like mm like meh ya
ya then
then like I think the new guy also um
because I think he's tired or what then then he was like not really like sincere lah in replying the call then um then from then on he then from there they argued over the text and then I think ya recently they keep arguing ah ya and a row it's just that I like
I don't know it's just
then I'm like
ya
ya but the
right but then the ex also uh cause I not to say I know the ex lah but because I was there for my friend when she was with the ex right then the ex also a bit problematic uh also because um when my friend was with this current guy right he the ex would always like tweet about her
and then the the current the current boyfriend would see the tweets because he know he knows the ex then the the tweets is all like damn rabak one eh it's like saying like uh when I was with your eh when you were with her uh behind your back right we did all this stuff and all then like

um like before COVID lah
new
ya that was so fun right and australia in camper van wah love those time seh
and like it just allows you to see the world in a different way lah you know right compared to when we stay at airbnb
like you can just parked up anywhere and just
or just you know if you happen to find like a nice eatery remember the donut eatery
ya I think that was berry van wah that was so nice
fish and chips right
ya they do fish and chips in a different way at different places lah
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more when they were in australia compared to
ya eh you said that you went to new zealand the other time
do you do anything interesting over there like
I don't know like they have like skydiving bungee or something right
eh but bungee is like once in a lifetime kind of experience eh
oh my god
serious eh
okay okay okay
eh but I heard if you do this kind of high risk activities right like so they will do a health check and then they will see whether you're eligible for activities and then you'll get some kind of like cert after it right
mm
so what interesting stuff did you do there since you didn't get to do bungee
I was watching the netherlands match ah so my cousin and I didn't keep up
ah K
oh okay
wait but you but did you guys packed for snow or not like did you have your all your winter clothes and like your thick you know you have the thick wear and everything
K lah at least you were sort of prepared for it lah to happen
I don't know what's nice over there
err melbourne was quite nice right eh or no no no no let me think
there was another hot drink that we had at the melbourne winter market what was it ah
like it was like an um
like a ya like an apples spice drink or something right
ya
ya
ah my god super super shiok
ya like you know like I have like
the best memories in a camper van like there was one time
when do you remember when we were like cooking right we were cooking something
and then I think we were parked at some national park was it a national park
wow like that's an experience you won't get here seh
ya lah ya lah that's true lah
ya
ya yes
ya ya I guess and probably they can't eat human food also lah
ya more more expensive places err like
those I don't lame places lah like I don't know some jewel factory which is not what we we sign up for
correct correct
so unforgettable
eh but okay you can go by driving but if you could fly I mean the possibilities is endless what
that's true
eh but you know what I've always wanted to do really like drive up all the way like you know selangor pass selangor
and then all the way to the borders and pass to thailand like I think that will be so fun eh but the way need like I don't know do we need like some kind of
license or how how do we go about doing that ah to get to thailand by car
yes yes definitely need to stop in lah like I need my dose of man
ah
nothing will happen to it right
like wherever you leave your car to travel to probably at the airport or something should be quite safe right
oh ya never thought of that ah
ya ya ya ya correct correct
ya but it's interesting to explore different modes of transport all your travelling lah
we drove that camper van right and then we got through err got through to tasmania from melbourne by ferry
and then after that we still took our camper van on another ferry to bruny island right yup
ya and it was so cute
and then
I think that was just the experience of trying to see how you drive onto
ya but that was nice what
ya but at least from the small bruny island boat we could see what was happening around us when we went into the ferry right it like we couldn't see anything happening because you when the bunker and all
ya except when we went out to the deck ah to explore the ferry kan
bunker did I say bunker
ya ya correct correct the cabin ya
ya I guess in a big boat okay you don't really feel it lah
ya correct
ya correct
ya eh you know what I miss another thing I miss about traveling
I don't know if you do lah but that's just me
ya the range I remember was definitely much more than what we have in singapore ya like
yogurts come on yogurts chocolates correct ya it wasn't that expensive
ya but like even the meats and everything was like so fresh wow I don't know why food tastes so much nicer overseas I think cause it's fresh produced right
ya
ya like so fresh and like
I don't know ah oh it's just damn different ah or maybe like we are just so used to singapore food that ya
ya the ice cream was
ya
but okay but you know the farm like the van diemen's one had err more like
ya but if I had to pick
amorino K amorino is off the question van diemen's for the flavours and messina for the range
ya I think
ya because but wow messina has that much flavours that it's so difficult to choose one
ya
ya but like that's a refreshing flavour that I don't think I've ever tried in singapore you know what
apple cranberry are you serious
no that's like just purely like apple like granny smith apple and cinnamon but that's not like a super unique or anything ah
gelato messina ah hands down ya
ah what what do you call it mm what was it like yuzu and like seaweed ya so it's like the local palate ya so it depends I guess
ya mm
eh and the other thing that I really like about
going overseas is that like markets you know like the
the farm what do you call ya farmers' markets and the fresh produce wah best seh
like I think there was some interesting food also that we find at those markets right
ya best donuts seh
ya
mm
like that trend hadn't reach singapore's shores is it
oh ya that's eh so actually bombolinis was like pioneered by dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts
uh I think it's the donut itself ah
very unique right
ya ya ya I remember they were like super thick and like wow oozing out ah
correct correct ya
like honeycomb custard or something wow
wow like mind blowing seh
ya that was interesting ah ya
eh what what was that like curry curry eh
ah thai green curry eh
I I remember I remember there was something like um
ah plantains ya correct
I'm not sure if that that's the same thing as banana or not
they grill or fried I can't remember but it was actually quite nice lah
oh to like caramelized the whole thing ah is it
that was also like a random find right
ya
oh K okay okay
ya
how did you know that she was actually um in dragon's den as in
ah okay okay okay
ya
like you know when we were craving for
satisfy
ya I mean that was before we found instant prata over there lah
ya but ya lah I do miss I do miss local food when I'm away
so what was your point again
ya
noodle oodle I think
ya
ya it's things that you miss about your local food that you seek over there lah
mm
what what what what do you miss
okay okay
ya
that was I think the same area as the pie shop is it
ya actually the pie also not bad also
like I no I remember there was sweet and savoury like um things on the menu
a pie pie face
ya that was nice also
ya
ya so that one was really like we drove into a quaint town
like was it even on our on our planning I'm I can't even remember ah
ya
ya correct
ya but you know in all those even despite all those changes and what not like we still managed to chance upon like nice places but
ya I think that was some some things which are unplanned are just
ya I just like
I guess ah I guess
ya
of course lah we had to what
ya
probably like
I don't know
more abundant over there
ya
no but you know why people spend on prada over there
because compared to when you buy over here it's much cheaper over there ah even though it's in a thousands
you can probably get a few bags for the price of
you know probably one or two bags that you get over here instead so you really save a lot ah
and because those factory outlets kan have everything under one roof tau
bicester kan bicester
bicester
we were so noob man
oh and then we had to get somebody to service or maintain kan yes yes yes
eh it's a once in a lifetime chance seh we never know if we are going to pass by that place again lor
trying to recall lah
err
I think we tried to stay away from the theme parks right
enchanted garden or something
no no no it's not luge
fifty eh
fifty sing ah
ah okay eh what what else was it that we did over there
ya like you enter a maze and then you try to find your way out
ya and then um
ya I just remember that that thingy ah what is it called ah
ya
that was like a house of mirrors
but ya ya that I think that was just one of the theme parks that we went to lah eh but the beaches there were nice eh
beaches I remember we had fish and chips at one of the beaches
ya at did we go to any beaches trying to remember
we did we did ya we did I remember a photo at the beach ya correct portsmouth
mm we really miss the nature ah
ya I mean that's something in that you don't have
an abundance of in singapore
ya eh but malaysia nature not bad leh actually
ya
mm
no lah you know whenever we track inside like the canopies like within the canopies
ya like it's cooling
ya
like I think we managed to find water like three or four waterfalls ya
ya but okay lah I mean like okay langkawi has nice beaches
okay lah it's hot no doubt about that probably you got to choose the correct time to go but
unfortunately when it's in asia when it's cool it rains
ya
when we can ah while we can
ya my friend has said nice things about spain actually I want to go to spain
you've been to spain and ya I have uh know two thousand maybe
wait what did you go to spain for
oh
eh but you were travelling when you were still a student is it
and then
so the cab fare was more than that bus fare ah
huh
so basically you were trying to catch your train err trying to catch your flight you mean
serious
oh my goodness so did you manage to catch your flight
mm
okay okay and like the timing wise
okay no cash on hand lah you mean
okay
mm mm
uh huh
okay okay
belgium right belgium muslim in belgium okay
oh I see like how much it's supposed to cost ah
ya it's like a regulation thing ya
oh wah were you like halfway through at least
okay okay okay
that was the amount that you were gonna pay him lah
mm
start of an adventure eh
so what what other things did you guys run into over there
eh wait but you guys managed to watch the game also or you guys just happened to like join in the celebration
I see
ya ya like uh
mm mm
mm
oh I see so how did you guys get back to your accommodation after that
and then as like budget students how did you guys manage your food and and other stuff like expenses
mm
no
ya ya ya cause I I think I remember like a hostel dot com or something
mm
okay
wait wait let me guess let me guess
is it because the prata was huge
then
oh
ya at least this guy was nice enough not to capitalise on your
on your
ah okay okay okay
I see I see
yup
oh
but if they have a siesta okay because this is something new to me lah I've never I've never encountered this before so
okay that's not too bad
because you know how like in australia they will like close their shops by like five or six except for weekends and thursdays or something like that
ya ya which is I think fair for the employees ah it's just the shoppers will probably be like ah what are we going to do now at such an early time like uh we still want to shop
oh K K eh what was he doing in madrid
is that something you would consider like working overseas
mm
yup yup yup yup yup
ya working overseas is something okay lah not a lifelong dream but
ya lah ya lah that's true I mean until you're really put in their situation then you will understand you know like
what it demands of you and whether you like it or not
cause like travelling is like a totally different thing but working and staying over there like the day to day thing is different from holiday happy happy kan
ya ya that's why lah
mm
like would you say that canada is a livable country totally
wow okay
mm
mm
um circles and stuff
active eh ah okay
oh right right okay
ya so you've really got to immerse yourself in the experience of fasting overseas ah

oh last night my friend
video called me until until so late
my two guy friends one of them
uh no the the guy the one in the girlfriend
called with us ah but he himself is not there
so the three of us
video called without him for the surprise
uh yeah
ya lah
it's a surprise it's called a surprise
so uh we we got plan A and plan B
I mean I mean
of course have to come up with a solid plan right
no plan A uh plan A we go we go Sentosa
the beach lah
come as a surprise
yes I think it'll be fine
why ah
why sia
so weird
no so go Sentosa uh we come with a cake and some light snack I think like Pezzo eh
then ya
then uh we get this combo
you know that now they are promoting tourist stuff for Singaporeans right
yeah so there's packages that you can visit different places
yeah so we we are we are going we are going for this package which which is like uh forty two dollars
or go
uh the wax museum
Tussauds
ya I think it's that one
uh the wax museum some Marvel
some Marvel
dah that's one for one you know means we can split into two lah
ya so split into two uh
one for one so two lah
yes
yeah
then uh that that wax museum uh
uh later ah but basically
basically uh those are our activities lah for the day
yeah then
after that uh they want to eat at satay by the bay is it
I've never been there my entire life
yeah
uh
no I know where it is I know
I know where it is but I've never been there to eat
no it's like a hawker centre
but very
the ambience the ambience is no it doesn't it's outdoor
night it's dinner
mm
ya so that's our dinner plan then second
uh plan B is
me and the not birthday guy
we go there and set uh we go Marina Barrage
yes we go Marina Barrage uh
we set up like a small
glamping something like that
ya but this one we
ya but now we do our own
this is Marina Barrage got anyone do tentage meh I never see before
no people just sit down and hang around there
ya
because there were other people lah that's the best we could find actually
obviously lah everyone will aim for that spot got shade what
it's two onwards
I would think we'll reach there three plus ah this is our plan B
um
but I say that will be very suspicious
he always park there then like
it's like it's like we might be meeting someone
I told them that
ya lah like caught them off guard kind so
yes
yeah can
ya
you must you must give the poker face like nothing is happening
no
he will definitely follow
uh on your birthday I already have something planned so you know
almost two years
eh or is it more than two I don't know lah but
long enough lah
ya
anyway
ya then that's sort of like the deciding factor ah then I said okay then another if if let's say
then we go Marina Barrage because it's easier
what was the deciding factor again I forgot ah
no okay wait no if we have a car we go to Marina Barrage
I don't like to waste time
yes yes
but
then I'm like he cannot lah
yeah
yeah
I honestly think Marina Barrage is a good idea
but but
okay I'm okay no okay oh wait wait wait
no we all like the activity we all can agree on that it's just that we know that we are starting late oh yes I remember the deciding factor
yeah
weekday cannot lah he what
then
so you see three plus
we can enjoy the activity the package got five different place you know
where got time to
no no we didn't choose that there there is a package with cable car but we didn't choose that
no
it's not really
I know got Shah Rukh Khan
you've been with me at Hong Kong
what I say just now
no then like oh yeah that's the deciding factor because sometimes
say he don't want to go for class ah he skip that week's class
yeah
then I but I told her lah uh whatever it is we don't be the one to tell him
we don't be the one to tell him not to go for the class lah it's wrong
yeah
yeah I mean if he wants to let him decide on his own
if he
Tampines ah
I think ah
no actually don't know
I think he usually come back Tampines he don't like to go back that house
no lah but he he always bring motor he will always pick up her first and she stay near Tampines hub there
so
no
near Tampines hub
yeah
yeah but ya lah he he likes
yeah
ya ya that's the deciding factor now I remember
attraction in Sentosa
yeah
six last eh entry eh something like that
ya lah which which means that there is five activities so if from three o'clock you wanna cut cake eat first that will be four plus already
cause we bring a small cake
err it's very he
yeah well they all want it that way
I okay jer
yeah
I give my opinions but you know uh eventually I feel that the one that has more say is the girlfriend lah cause
she would know how to get him there or
I like surprising people
I'm pretty good at it
but yeah I mean there will be a time where I'll be like you also right
so let me enjoy my youth
let me enjoy my youth okay
yeah but I really I really hope that we go Marina Barrage
yeah it's simpler
then like
food lah estimate
he said last time he went he paid three hundred plus
but but with eleven people
then like I got a shock ah I'm like what in the world three hundred plus
all guys yes I must add that all guys
so it's like
and it was during the time so they are probably really hungry
and I was telling them ah
I was telling them uh I'm a very picky eater you know and like I don't know what's there so
I was saying that to the girlfriend
yeah
then
I don't I told her I don't eat satay
I really don't
yeah
eh but the place looks nice they wanna go DuitSg actually
I don't know but I know it's a famous place right now people are always going there
Canberra Canberra
DuitSg
uh they sell their specialty is what ah
I don't I don't eat this kind of thing lah okay
I hate that question because like I really don't know where to go
you just make up your mind and then I follow
it's okay lah just go with the flow if cannot then cannot lah
we can just like
but like
very light food lah
cannot eat cannot eat I okay jer
um
hmm
uh eh mm
that that that that's a
that's a good
then I'm like
then I'm like okay guys anywhere I don't know much you all decide about food
ya about food I really don't care
all I need is drink
I okay as long as I have water bottle with me
yeah
it was super hot bro
ya ya they did mention that
ya
anyway ya so that's the plan lah
um
then we talk about like other things lah
she you you can tell that she really put in effort to
yeah
that's what she say ah
I do a lot of things so
I'm like uh I think FaceTime better ah but like ten thirty onwards
ya so ten thirty onwards yesterday they call me until one plus
ya then
who the two guy friends and me that is our clique we have other friends but
Arshad
one big group
yes yes yes that's right
so he is in that big group
okay in that big group there's the three of us
inside got that circle three of us then inside this big group got another
slightly bigger circle the one that come over to eat
yeah lah you know
those people
no those people lah
those people are like the other group
overlap meaning
oh the thing is uh out of the three of us that two guy friend and me
yeah so so
so he he said what for attend such thing
like so he likes to be within this three of us
yeah
ya bubt it's easy for him to do that because he wasn't he's not one of the girls right he wasn't even close to her to begin with
yeah
yeah so he don't like
yeah
yeah yeah
then
ya then ya lah
so but then we
they know
they know how close I am with the other two
they I told you right they are going this weekend
yeah
yeah
yeah
then when I I said in the group I was busy you guys
no then then
then I'm like no ah don't let me be the deciding factor ah
mm ya true so
now now I'm just like okay go ahead lah
it's okay
then I say lah anyway
and I'm always used to be the odd one out so
if we go in odd numbers
I've been out with three people to and it sucked
ya
ya ya
and it really sucked
because every ride of course she would wanna go together with the other girl
uh I mean huh I don't mind
I don't mind I'm not
I enjoy lah but you must go with the right group of friends
so far the best experience I had was probably with Humaira and marissa
yeah I realised that uh I enjoy going out with
I enjoy just one more person don't need like a group
yeah
ya that's how I feel with the two guy friends lah I mean
other than the fact that they are two guys
I okay
yeah
I don't also what
ya you see like like Ria
like I just go with another person anyway that one no
that one
that one no choice
only the two of us
mm
it's okay lah
I mean yeah they go see they are going they are asking about the price haven't buy the ticket
sunday
yeah
yeah I know ah
so sad leh is
is because I recognise their faces so it
because they don't look they are not Singaporeans it's easy to tell what
no it's because I went there prominent lah
like
every weekend with different group of friends
during I think that one poly right
during my break
then I get the pass
err towards the end towards the end ya lah third year
okay lah uh
I sorry ah but ya lah that's the difference between you and me lah I enjoy pe
I enjoy all the ride now the rides that I used to be scared of is no longer scary for me
yeah
uh red one not blue
dangling I want to tho
hhmm
waste money sia go in take photo
ya lah the vintage car
oh yes
oh ya I remember eating that with Humaira
I remember you were pregnant lah last time when you go with me
crazy
I know
no it wasn't
it clearly stated no pregnant lady should be on this ride
that was early early part lah
yes you are right
crazy crazy woman
yeah you're crazy
it was a thirty second ride lah so
some kids are scared
there is the moment that thing drop what
do you even remember what you took I don't think you remember because you were just having fun
yeah I went with Marissa she was she was screaming her heads off
uh
I got somemore drawing to do
oh ya ya ya ya
ya ya cannot
what was her email ah
need to find her email
mm
ya
ya lah anyway
that's the thing I feel like she's not shy to speak to ask about
stuff also
yeah
she talked she talked about uh how
we were saying lah we know we know the process of how he met her right
so found her Instagram
and then
ya you know the nonsense
nonsense kind of
line lah I mean it's not even true he wasn't even there that's the funny part
so she replied and then they started talking
ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya he knows what he wants ah that kind
ya
that's right
yes
ya err also because he knows himself better lah learnt from mistakes
he will take action
huh
I think a bit lah he's not that bad
it's just that teenager angst you know
back then
ya ya ya whatever you call it
whatever you call it lah
but he changed for the better seriously he changed a lot
ya it's it's that kind of feeling lah
he's only what four right calm down
he's not even going to primary school yet then you will freak out
he will grow up because he meet
a lot of people he would learn how to do things on his own
suddenly you don't even hear him screaming mama anymore he will just mind his own business
mm
I think that's me
I think I share a lot of things happened in school or whatever to
I do that I do that just so she won't feel worried
that's my main objective not really because I want her to know what eh what's happening
no no no
now now as a mother do you think that is right
no right if you see your daughter or son
very quiet you don't know what's happening
I tell you already I don't know I you didn't
yeah yes definitely because I didn't even remember talking to you
you were
ya I feel like you were in your own world
you uh it's like I don't even talk to you I don't even know what's happening in your life
yeah
now now that you mentioned it just now right you got married when I was in sec one
so it sounds a bit funny
teenage ah
yeah but you already bloomed dah

yes
ya
really

you know you know when it was me in school when there's a surprise test
then I just look at my friends did you did you study no okay
then just do the test lah
I don't I mean
I learned halfway through in my life when I was in school
I learned not to put so much pressure on myself and some things I cannot control
what I mean
school's supposed to be fun don't have to cry over surprise test
I'm talking to you right now
yeah maybe when he's big enough like me next time you can story

but in secondary school I think I was just busy with my and upper sec is my

uh doing the practical right so at the back with the
drilling drilling machine it's called drilling what is it called I think so
but it's for acrylic right
she didn't tighten the acrylic properly and she on the drill
so the thing starting spinning so all the
chips flew out then cut cut cut cut cut cut her hand everywhere
and then I was just behind her and then I'm like
off the damn switch lah why are you like you know letting the thing keep on spinning
because she was shocked herself
then then I just
you know acrylic like plastic sharp sharp
cut cut cut cut
the sharp edges
yes
so I just went to the side and pull out the plug
and then my teacher come
you know teachers are usually supposed to be strict right
he just
he laughed he was like what in the world are you guys doing
the drill is nothing wrong it's just where the the the the holder where she put the acrylic she never tighten it properly
yes kiap the thing whatever you call it

so he decide and he he decided he wanted to try out I think corporate world so leave it be lah
ya
I think so
I think so not too sure
okay lah
but ya
finally somewhere I go is near my house
like at least at least ah fifty minutes travel
that's so sad
um not
I apply right then I turn up at the interview
then they ask me a lot of questions then it felt like an interview
ya
mm mm
ya ya no issues lah ya I think
I would say that she overrides him
ya ya I know
err oh last time
err the assistant director did this err blah blah blah and then she always say if I need help can come and ask ah then
um ya you can just give the money just collect the receipt and then log it in lah
ya
then I was like but the chat I thought the chat is also meant to be used internally
mm
I guess so good and bad lah
like what is it there's no bad impact lah on the client at the end of the day ah
like ya but
but at different locations ah under different program
mm mm
I think
in the social service ya
ah then it's also under so previously my previous job um they are the funders ya
so err
how to say
err fast and err presentable results
that's your
it's considered private affairs what uh
so in the end you have to get consent from them
they cannot
then
ya and then ya that's why
emotions and what happen during their period of time and usually christmas chinese new year spend with family right usually is like a big major events for them
ya
ya correct correct
ya
supposed to
supposed to ya
uh no no
um you have to record down ah
and I was like
I don't know I I think I'm not suited for at all
so it sounds a bit
like case management same thing but for youths so then ah
so then I ya so then I was like asking so what's the difference lah because last time like this kind of services still the same and
I mean it's duplicated in different services and then second of all is that it's just basically you asking the
uh people I think can't remember where
ah so I don't know lah what's going on
uh ya so
as as long as the place is position is empty lah
ya cause I just
uh like

okay
huh
mm
okay can
oh I was like uh
I was like uh
I was like don't you think my voice sounds like a man when you play it over cause my voice is not
lower register lah basically
ya
ya unless I'm like super excited to talk then I can go quite high
I think one
then I was like err
ya
you sound like what my cousin inhan
but usually isn't it the the people with like deeper voice like you have a wider range
err I guess not like we're going to sing any time soon
oh no it stopped already at my side
ah okay lah good good good uh
listen to our
mm mm
ah
we're gonna die
what that's so funny
that's
ya but just ah yes
yes he wants to do like space right space travel or something like that right
is it him
you see
I don't know lah okay lah he got some admirable traits
I guess and then it's like he's from a I think
single I mean single mother household
I if I recall I think so lah
I don't know was it him or someone else ugh
cannot ask me who about celebrities background ah
huh
ya I did uh aiya
why
ya
um
that areas or like it's my area like which is far for you
um
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya good
like uh
uh
it's near to
ya it's near to tampines interchange actually
mm
I can send it to you but the the pictures are nice I think like I've
she goes to how's afiqah ah
ah
mm no
ah when was she married ah
ah eh
okay
ah okay okay
I
okay
you never met the guy is it
mm
mm mm okay ah nothing ah
eh is he our age
okay
okay now now where are they staying
ah
mm
mm mm
I think there might be some tension
ya
mm
ya ah ya
one person stay at home like you still need that double income somehow
ya
is uh
babysitters so
ya so
ya
ya
ya
I know
four months four months
mm
mm
you send the kid to play group lah then even then even then it's not full time you but not sure lah ya so do you want to work part time and then
I think ya

so basically um
the whole thing was just about meeting this guy guy and err so err
the whole premise is
he just needs to be very upfront and truthful about who he is and what he does and everything lah about his life so
true enough lah he is a very uh forthcoming and upfront person so that
is already an uh up point for him lah you know in in in trying to understand this whole situation that is how they want to proceed
so
changi airport
um
and that changi airport is what we thought it was lah to actually look out for suspicious characters and all that
ya
that's why she's so she's so secretive she's so like unsure she's so she she probably receive it but don't know how to express it that's the problem and this is something she has to grow from it lah
that's why she gets a earful from me about it and then um so now he is uh working at uh novena and he is there because uh he wants to do office work and rightfully so lah because he wants to uh spend more time lah with your family
uh and
since he has going to move towards
getting married uh he thought this the right step ah as opposed to shift work
which makes sense and it's it's very sound lah in why he's doing it okay then he talk about um
okay they know each other for two years
two year they know each other for two years
know of each other for two years only got serious for one year
ya so that is the whole thing okay ah this one ah oh every time I do as in ah like
was it so difficult to ah get this out
the mirror the mirror side
ah middle side ya facing the living room ya it's in the
so ah what else um okay so I I
ah okay that makes sense then that makes sense with the timeline and he say he just finished his fifth year of of his bond this year
ah that one that one also he shared with me about the retention bonus and all that
ah
clear I ask him okay you know do you have contact uh do you have connect plan that's he look at me like uh what was that then I say like do you get certain bonuses for like certain number of years oh we call those retention bonus and he mentioned another bonus
so and and then he said lah ya ah six years seven years and then after that fifteen years and ah okay
that's why exactly that's why I say
ya lah but I don't know why they want that place lah anyway so
I told them okay this could have been done better this could have been managed better don't you think that you would have this is my advice and this is what I
ah he did he think that because he his mindset is if let's say he gets it and this couldn't be done he can just cancel
correct ya
so um ya so that that part they understood lah you know what it's it's spilt milk ready lah kan like there's no point to talk about it it's not something they can change in the future the only thing that they can change right now like I said to them is
from now on you both need to be very upfront
inform both sides on what you want to do so that both sides are better equipped
and then
that's why lah
that's why that's why I say I just want to hear him talk zina whenever zina butts in I was like I just wanna hear you talk and then err
ah revise plan ah ah correct
ah I also don't want to embarrass lah zina cause like I said it could have been easily a bashing zina session but no point lah the point is to hear what he want what he's saying and whether it makes sense and whether this is the correct plan to go ahead with
for zina to actually ah secure a job
that's why
so it's like okay at least he knows lah that's why that's why I say it's very it's very easy
so then okay good so you know that ya you both need to be working lah and you zena needs to build her and then I spoke to him also saying that you have work for five years you know right there is value in having a work experience zena hasn't gotten that yet so she needs to at least have one year of proper work experience
then they said ya the plan is for zina to
work so that she build her and then they also talk about children ah then say then their plan is after getting married they don't want to have children for at least two to three years
to build themselves up first then after that they can decide on settling down with children okay good that that that is a solid plan
ah that one okay lah they bring about the halal thing lah so I was saying that yes I understand where you coming from but look at the the situation right now
ya zina needs to do some growing and then like I said and you both need to
you
grow up
grew up together
ashraf you've heard from my advice that I gave just now and you heard about all the other advice at my dad has gave also
and then
ah come together to grow
so what is your take on that do you agree do you disagree or what is your perception
ah then they say
okay for me I uh I feel that
so it's like if he lah in the sense that ah so so I said okay I think you both
not just growing up
then after the whole session also I told zina and even just now I texted saying that
so
of course lah
mmhmm
anyway I
so mm ya then I told him okay ashraf after all that's been said ah I will let you know that I do appreciate that you come here up here it tells a lot okay being upfront
with us counts for a lot
okay that's why for now okay moving forward you guys both need to be very upfront about what you want to proceed with so that clear for both parties and it makes the whole process a lot easier
ya lah I said you have
mm
then
um so basically that's it lah and then
at least it's it's clear lah that they have
at least he has his plan but
I observe from the
no he will just use
mm like
mm ya can see he will be the one leading the the marriage lah
ya
so
ya
sister is working as a librarian but at changi
ya so it's was very easy lah then after when he left also I was telling lah see how easy and simple ashraf
was
by just being upfront
no zina you have to learn you have to be proactive okay you will have to be proactive
be upfront and be proactive you cannot everything you don't know I think cannot
you want to be married you have to be proactive
ya lah so basically that that kind of like eases up the conversation and we adjourn to the dining to eat
ya so
like my ah that's why it was very simple lah because
at first this guy already you can see right has at least some work experience and some knowledge about how you know a bit about adult working life at least that lah kan
so and he also can recognize lah the value in it and can recognise why you know zina needs to have that
and ya that's why he also decide that zina needs to work
ya but the arrangement is where do you get married and they settled down to have children two to three years time zina would be the one taking care of it
ashraf ah because uh
someone needs to be there at home lah he he's not gonna depend on like
his parents or zina's parents to take care of the child you know someone needs to work he will be working lah and then I then I ask him so uh are you exploring the possibility of zina working part time then he say ya if she can work from home then that's fine
okay okay then to me
um
okay lor then after then the
in the dining
uh
ya so that's why it was very it was a lot easier to to actually address all these things because
clear lah clear and upfront
different different things
so ya to me it's it's it's simple
for example
um
okay
no she is not proactively looking she is just if it comes it comes she's not proactively looking for it
huh
zina is receiving dayah is not there yet
like she has to be the one working and then this guy is not working ah ah
then is mama say ya but this guy anytime he he he's well educated anytime he can
dayah at is at this stage of her life
mm
mm so we don't know that lah huh
basically this this guy ya
that's why
so oh anyway going back to zina I I told zina like
you need to sit down and you really need to uh
figure out the plan on how you gonna
plan it out
fair enough lah if he uh considered um
cause he then I say uh I
uh
I I address to her you see how simple it was you need to learn to be proactive like how ashraf is
I told her lah did you see or not what ashraf did
ya
that's why lah she just
that's the thing
so she sees it as oh
that's me I'm easy-going
I I told her off about that
zina that is not easy-going
mm
is not against each other you know
easy-going it is
when you are very upfront able to share easy-going you don't have to hide that is also easy-going what
you are not um having a hidden agenda you're not trying to mask certain things you're easy going you're an open book that's easy-going also
mm
that's why during the
that's why ashraf
if
the way
ya lah of course
still a lot ya
of course
ya of course we are we are happy that this at least he is competent lah
I don't think he would lah if he does that he knows that he's just souring the relationship with me
err
push zina right
pull
pull
ya
consume
step up
mm
so ya basically concludes the whole thing lah with
zina and ashraf then
say what do you mean don't talk each other then we to talk about personal things
that's it sit down here tell me what's the problem
she say ya dayah and me then ya I understand that you and dayah are two different people you have two different beliefs
but
at the very least you should find a common ground that you are both sisters and you are there for each other
then I say ya I know she has all this never like me you know
so you know now this is a problem right so what are you going to do about it
ya she also okay don't talk about her talk about you what are you going to do about it
ya I tried already I see I try already then she doesn't want to try
okay
what you are telling me is the same as what hidayah is telling me
okay so I'm going to take it as
you know positively
both of you have tried
ah
huh
you lah ah then
get help from me why both of you cannot be proactively coming to me is it
I had the same kind of argument with me and izat I bet you ah you and dayah would not be talking to each other now
because the severity of it is so bad that you guys can't even talk about personal things
at least ah you see ah it me and izat
I'm doubting you know whether you and dayah would apologise to each other
ya ya
that's why lah that's why it seems it's
ya lah
sure but okay maybe contextually is different but what I'm saying is you should be comfortable to be able to speak to each other
no we're not always at loggerheads this is just one episode all the while we have never been at loggerheads
when we were younger yes but when we were married this is the first of a long time
what the
like have to see it as steps lah
so
that I mean like
how he approach it he needs to learn to work it out
so okay lah I think
I can tell that me and izat even though we are staying in two different place we still can engage in conversation
uh huh
that family comes first
that you need to see that
at the end you are both gonna suffer
so I told ya lah so I told her nevermind
the what I need from you is are you in agreement
we will make it happen
yes so I
and then
mama wah at one okay at one point
mm
nevermind just mm
okay so anyway I'll just continue talking like um there was one point where um
then I said zina since when you are that close to izat then she said ya you don't know I'm that close to izat then I say rubbish lah
I say since when I'm the one who hs been with you for all your stages
so that's why I told her ya zina you are close to izat because of the boys ya I said that you're close to him because of the boys you did the boys are not there how will you be close to izat
izat is just a byproduct this relationship that you have I didn't meant to say the word byproduct ah but I say you are close to the boys just because of uh
uh you are close to izat just because the boys uh with izat you know
and because of the boys therefore you are close to izat
then I say since when you been talking to izat since when
all all the
you are that close to izat then I say which part
primary school secondary school tertiary
where where did it come from just got recent just because of this topic when and then just because of the boys kan
further studies
ah then I then I also
need this person the person ah to help you guys bridge it
then she said me then I said ya then you think what izat can do this job ah
ah then izat do you think then she's like smile ah aiya lah cannot lah
then I say you know right that this is not his strength
you know right this is one thing that I know you know that I can help right
mm that's why
hmm
you both are not proactive in the sense that you both didn't come up and ask why is it that I have to ask you whether you want this help or not really backward one really weird
so
they are basically complacent because right now they are in the same house they think right they have enough interaction with each other but it's not about the
frequency it's about the quality
you know comfortable
ya of course

well if I have
three wishes kan
um the firstly lah I
I would like to become a millionaire
oh ya sorry my last wish is that
I got a lot of friends who from all walks of life I can just um
okay how many options just ah one or two or three
not that good
meal eh
oh overseas okay I got one that I remember
whale meat when I go to japan
so that's the one advantage about people in japan
the taste is really unique lah
figure out whether it's the meat or the fats but highly likely it's the fats
the best eh
to that extreme yes
ah
no the wagyu beef is actually made in japan
japan japan it's not korea
a special kind of breed only for
ya
itaewon the itaewon actually is actually if you go up
the very big mountain is not really a mountain ah it's just a urbanised area
so when you go up err that hill
then after that if you go down
they are malaysians but the way they cook the bulgogi is very nice even a lot of koreans go there to eat the the bulgogi
the moment you order the whole chicken they just give you the whole chicken
cause I go it's actually
minimum degrees I was there was a
the lowest I've been there in japan
you know what I saw I saw snow
that was the first snow I saw and
in my life in my life so basically that was the very personal lah I I actually go down
nearest park then that's where all the snow is lah
very interesting
hot or rain cause if you okay for holiday wise I would really love to experience the four
cause why for I mean for own
and wah I tell you the
okay in japan kan in a middle of
the village so that is a very interesting concept only exists in japan from what I know of lah
and they let us to see how they do things very in a closed up and they are not very defensive lah but of course is best if you
know people who can speak japanese there
not all the villagers can speak english especially the
school lah cause err frankly speaking in asia right
really far kan
ah so that is the gist lah actually
halal food plus alcoholic inside cause why they need to cater to the tourists
they cannot just cater
hundred percent halal they won't accept err alcohol beverages around at all
very interesting kan that's what I when if you go around the world then you see lah
mm
correct correct correct is like that one
uh so they have the alcoholic
for them to to you know to do their things
ah so that is the gist lah
actually things that are tasty can also be healthy ah but again lah like
into youtube kan
ah yes cause garlic is very good lah basically garlic is the most natural antibiotic
for the indian people so basically
but you don't eat everyday you eat everyday you have a really an adverse effect on your body is no good
healthy eh I
healthy
fruits lah I eat fruits lah but uh if you want it
okay ah usually fruits lah I just eat fruits
oh almost everyday is egg lah by right egg is is considered healthy food mah
skills eh meaning what
one of the the three skills I want is of course I want to code I want to learn how to code very well not just to code lah code very very well so that I can build
err games I can build apps I can build a lot of things why
and that is your business product ah after you have a product then you can easily make money from that product it's a
have the how to say the
the motivation to do business the all this kind of enterpreneurship
from that product can we can make money a lot of money that is what I want one of the thing is
uh one of the three skill is coding skills
so the next skill I want is a of course
you must get the right ingredient and the right recipe if not it'll be too
too much on the taste of asian or too much on taste of western side which is also not a good balance
all
to eat for every time no I don't want but of course I like I said I want to have the skill to know how to cook cause uh again ah
if if you know how to cook you can go anywhere
and you can actually make a lot of friend if we use your skills you can make a lot of money also
if you know how to cook with your skill cause
again uh it's all about the skill set ah if we got
some more if you know how to cook it's not only you can make money you can also
feed yourself good food not only healthy but also good
food ah
just say food
so basically in mixed martial art there's no way you can become good but in karate yes and last time I learn
goes very deep lah and also very err
they have very rich history uh their okinawan
karate-do aikido
if you're late for one minute eh they totally banned you from the class at all
tense your body means you have more strength but by right okinawa the original one right you cannot tense your body you must expand your body
cause only when you expand your body then like
realistic more relax and more
kata it's actually they are
they fight for close distance
to charge at the long distance
to fight the short distance
ah that's why when they have the any competitions
they do not know about okinawan the original one
they are trained not to use any weapons
once you get to a certain level you will be trained to use uh a weapon to fight
of course cause I like
things I like I really
I will really ah do research on it
sorry again
was free
err
yes of course healthcare
so if you really think it's not that
logical but again of course from the government point of view is good why cause if you don't do this err
imagine all the roads will be full of cars everyday
and imagine all the
I mean that is the realistic view lah but if like you say you ask me again
humans no longer
oh
oh
okay ah
they like to
conquer
so most likely if we don't do anything like
when meaning the golden age of islam
when people had nothing to do
what do they do
they learn more stuff
how algebra was created is cause of all these smart people who actually
so what they do is on their free time which they have everyday
modern stuff
came all the way back from that the golden age of islam
that few hundred years whereby islam was in their golden age
then we have all these smart people I do not know their name cause I don't
scientific medicine everything that we experience in life right now
mm
everything
so most likely will
space is our new frontier basically we will definitely create something or do something
go to mars maybe go to venus
ah cause I think that is the way to go lah you just want to explore
yes explore and learn new things
of course when we explore we learn
activity eh
meaning what ah
hmm ah eight hours eh
activity eh activity
activity
eight hours eh
wah
no no no is working out
so if you play the computer games for eight hours straight eh I
I don't think I can that kind of activity is really is bad for your health also very bad
karma
ya
if I can answer this in two ways whether a layman term
or can make it into a comical joke lah if a comical joke easy ah double cheeseburger
so if you but if you're talking in that about karma all this kind of thing right
cause err my life how to say ah
it's a pretty boring lah
I don't think I'm the kind of person but ya lah
actor eh err
okay ah actor is I okay until now right
I want to wake up as brad pitt why cause I only like him in one thing
um he was actually the
first hollywood actor to actually have the eight packs
they'll go to the gym and have eight packs also he was the first one ah also another thing about brad pitt is that a
he plays in this movie movie which I really like err
what troy that
trojan war troy
between this ah
troy three hundred is actually same thing but a troy
that cannot be killed uh then after that
have to stay in greece they will find a lovely wife you know this kind of thing but then people will forget about him but if he wants to
even a thousand years after he's dead which is now actually
ah orh even beyond that um you have to go to trial to fight this war and being achilles being a
egoistically that eh
we want to achieve in life in life is to be remembered
any movie you see any genre or what
all the male ah character whether it's the
protagonist or whatever
we just want one thing one achievement it's to be remembered that's all
we want to leave a legacy and they want to be remembered the same
for this ah characters also this achilles
uh his main purpose is to be remembered
as this greatest warrior that they have
that has ever lived in the world
in the history of mankind ever
you know so basically ya lah and the process of him achieving that kind of legacy especially I like
which all the quotes that all the quotes
that they used um can really
make if you really into this ah like me
I am quite influenced by all these quotes cause I will take them to heart and I apply it in my daily life
example my workplace if it's very bad very stressful lah I remember the quotes for example from the gladiator
ya that's the gist
oh how I keep ah I don't know leh
actually I just went through life ah
this my life
like I said I have a very boring life and this is my boring life
no no no I
not say I don't read book I read books but I
I think about me and books is that um
after I read a book for half an hour
all these uh youtube lah especially youtube
youtube or whatever even now they have screenshare all these kind of things which you just learn
from it lah
you just watch it cause I mean I'm that kind of a character whereby I need
to see things
then I'll be interested in things then I'll get
I need to know more info about the thing if you ask me
to do research I will do research on the videos
or the pictures
I won't do research about all the texts I won't read one
I don't like I would
pictures and of course obviously the videos lah I really like this kind of things then
the thing about me right err I think I
quite a good memory basically what I see I can remember and what I want to remember I can really remember
for a long time but if I don't want to remember something ah err you talk to me today next day I already forget already but if I want to remember something I will really really make an effort to remember the thing
so that's the gist ah
seventeen years old eh
seventeen years
old self
ah
seventeen
need to know ah you need to give me a time period
seventeen
oh poly eh
err
advice
I don't truthfully ah I don't regret anything
advice eh okay the best thing is
ah
ah actually frankly speaking eh at that time
you don't you won't have that kind of a
first time I was exposed and we were taught the C plus plus
visual basics I still remember this
even though it's more than ten years ago ah and actually
ah if you you can see they are not that smart also
so when you ask them the questions
they will start to get angry get
agitated cause they themselves they don't know a lot of things
even for those like you imagine ah
and I don't think at that time in with my maturity whatever I've been through in life I can handle that kind of
err
things in life yet
your character back then when you
uh
so my character when I was only
that kind of thing so just live life lah
just a live my life that's all lah mm
where do I see myself eh
in five years' time eh okay in three years' time I'm confirm will buy a house already
and I will earn some a rental income a rental income from that
definitely so the five years' time I'll see myself is just same ah as what I see myself now
just the same unless if I fall in love and get married lah so usually is you do like that
actually
all I want in five years' time is to have more knowledge

yes yes yes correct
yes yes yes
mm
yes
correct correct correct
yes
yes yes I understand yes
ya ya ya ya
I understand ya
understand understand
ah
ya
yup yup yup
like but but so when you when you give me this kind of things right then you you are letting me know a a different perspective uh a different way of seeing how you know the person behaves in that kind of stuff so I think uh it's quite it's it's something that uh there I I would I would um and then there's always a lot of things for me to learn lah
I am I am I still am actually yes you did yes you did
for me
oh right
that I couldn't I I didn't want to land man I didn't want to go back down to earth I wanted to keep flying
oh definitely man I will want to fly man I want to have wings man no need I don't need speed man I want to fly as high as possible
actually I realise I did not need to have science per se I just needed to understand the concept of flying
ah no no it was a academic uh more of a academic kind of uh mistake lah uh I mean it was a academic um how to say ah misstep which which I could have my my my um my potential was was was higher if I had been in arts but I chose to be in science ah which means then after that err the after that okay so after that I had another setback
and when I was uh just before I enlisted in two thousand five I think two thousand five two thousand six ah I had this medical condition so okay so backtrack a bit ah when I was in I had to undergo an operation which was appendix appendicitis ah so I had to remove my appendix because err it literally blow up inside my stomach ya the doctor was saying if I had err not err what err gone to the hospital lah uh if I've gone to the hospital one day later they wouldn't have been able to save me
it it was okay for about a year or two but then there was a complication and it was a medical complication uh in which this this uh operation actually made my stomach lining weak
uh because they have to cut they have to cut through mah so apparently I think there's a hole there and what happens is that my my err my intestines my my innards they actually can slip through that hole and form a hernia
so it was a it was a one medical condition after another lah basically so it was first it was an appendix then uh it gradually became a hernia after two to three years now the problem with hernia is this for medical eh in a medical sector your intestines uh usually you know they're very long right and if let's say if they slide down towards your groin area ya they can get twisted
when these intestines get twisted it becomes a medical emergency and you need to have a immediate surgery to
uh apparently that can be fixed okay err and and basically what happens is uh if you fix it uh generally it won't happen but there is a chance that it might recur again after you fix it
so guess what I fixed mine two years later
this this this this uh this condition but um the good thing was I went for another op so I I fixed I fixed the condition
and uh hopefully hopefully lah ah cross my fingers that it doesn't it doesn't return again lah
huh this year I'm thirty five bro
so I I have already I started flying when I was uh in the you remember there was a period of time I don't whether you know or not I was okay so I was in the because I joined the university that is err err specifically flying related
so uh they teach you how to fly and they teach you I mean you get a degree and all there at the end of the day uh but I was in the and it was this time when I was in the that I actually learn and train and I and I actually got to to fly you know real real flying lah
and this was in twenty fourteen twenty fifteen somewhere around there
am I still what
in that in that in in in that ah oh debt uh I was out of debt but I think now with my new house I will be indebted again
ya ya ya ya
okay what are you what are your plans you tell me your plans
okay okay yes
yes when I was in the correct yes correct I I managed to fly with them uh ah no no no I was in a I was in a a corporate uh site I was actually doing uh business business aircraft when I was in the
I managed to get myself a stint together with singapore flying college so singapore flying college needed instructors
yes so when COVID happened err this this whole thing the whole industry was affected everybody was you know down nobody was flying and and it was a very bad err I mean it was just a very bad timing ah it was the worst hit industry ever uh unfortunately a lot of the planes that stopped flying will never fly again you know because it it becomes too expensive to maintain them and uh they lost too much of money that is virtually impossible to to revive all these aircraft and what some of the aircraft that they operate also quite a bit old lah so so the best interest is just to retire these aircraft and they will never fight again ah
to the parts ah they get uh they they have this place in australia they call it alice springs it's a it's a aeroplane graveyard
graveyard yes so
uh some of them they do but most of them for the most part err they don't need right they just they juts leave them there lah they just leave them there too ya it's a it's a ya
they can they can but I think I mean who I mean when when they they put it there ah nobody wants to uh you know ah then there's no particular entity or organisation that actually is in charge of this lah you know to to so so the the easiest way is just to leave them there and then just you know just just leave it be lah
oh man they have a lot man I I'll show you pictures of uh of the airplane graveyard over in the ya they have they have one in the they have one in australia you know they have a lot lah this kind of places
correct correct it was it was another avenue and and I realise that it was uh it was an avenue that others have done before and did it and they made it so it was quite okay lah so I thought it was uh it was a good thing so I thought I I tried it out at that point in time and and I did lah and I'm glad I did you know and I'm and I'm glad we we we went through it and we we we tried it out and we try our best you know ya
yes ya ya ya ya
yes yes
yes correct
but but for now uh I got the next best thing which is uh flying drones lah
I will I will make aeroplane noises flight attendants in your positions my passengers eh
ya that's the that's that's what I I hope not to happen ah but if that ever happens ah you will know why ah you know all about the history behind it lah you can tell people oh yes I know this guy I know what happened to him ya lah yes yes yes so this is his story this is his autobiography his life story you know oh my goodness

bishan lah
ah
ah
okay
are you suffering from any uh no of course everybody will know
can I put no
have you ever been no
ah ah
cut
ah ah lah

eh hi
ya
okay which plan
okay
ya
per month
okay
so every month you pay how much
okay
so
mm
ya
ya
the same
have you checked
oh okay
ten gigabyte kan per month okay
oh
ya ya
uh
ya around there two thousand sixteen I think ya
four years eh but I think you just bought kan iphone six plus the new one or you upgrade eh
oh still iphone lah
oh but I think recently you bought kan a new phone
oh
ya
unless you have wifi lah at home you already have wifi kan or
ya
ya
iphone the new one I think is this year early this year twenty twenty
to me it's the same as iphone eight ya it's much similar to iphone eight
have have have iphone eight plus ya the the big one
there's about four point seven inch
so I'm not sure if there's a face recognition ah I don't think so
let me check
there's no more ah sorry they don't sell anymore ah iphone eight
so I think they replace with iphone starting from six hundred and forty nine dollars
ya the cheapest
but I I'm currently using iphone eleven lah so I think for camera wise if you love the camera kan take pictures all I think iphone eleven is good enough ah iphone eleven uh
not too sure ah cause I never use iphone eight before iphone eleven ah
ya alamak
who
tuesday wednesday and thursday
ya monday and friday off ah
I'm not really looking to job search yet ah cause I'm doing freelance ah so I have several project to handle for for the app development
I think by end of the year lah I try to finish this projects and without expecting much lah I think I think the most important thing is experience ah and the skills that I will acquire ya
once I start working ah I'm more prepared ah prepared than ever
I think it's a bit hard ah because once you already
ya you mean like interview is it
ya you really most tech companies they will offer about three to four round of interview so the first step
they really coding test ah they would will want to see whether you are
you have the skills ah you have the knowledge
in the internet and most of the coding answers are there already
ya
ah ya
and they will ask you like on the spot lah like how do you solve this ah ah this coding test like
like what kind of algorithm do you use what kind of
like what kind of
ya that
like how do you solve the problem lah I think that's the most important
then I think it's also not the answer that is uh that is important for them I think it's like how you
how would you explain to them lah
ya
it's more mostly interview skills lah that
so what what about you have you
have you been job hunting
ah monster ya the recruiter right the recruit company
they want you fast ah mm
the expected
oh
ya
ya
ya if they can't offer you lah
oh
I'm not sure like what like what's your expectation depends on the I think to me is the job job position like example if you are like a assistant engineer
ya aviva ya
full time
oh okay okay
ya
ya
ya
oh
ya
ya
mmhmm
oh
oh okay okay
but that enable there's you know there's normal tech and also have a communicated ya ya so
normal acad ya ya
ah the
ya
mmhmm
ya
mm
mmhmm
microsoft office ah
okay okay
oh ya correct correct
ya they they are too detailed ah
they said okay monday to friday
the timing is uh I think
oh
mm
ya over work ah
ya
ya
yup understood
if it involves coding like for example I think most of the data science they need coding kan they need like
python or
or
ya I think it's considered high level
ya
ya it's high level ya
low level like I think if you learn like the basics of computer science fundamentals
so mostly it's like S language or like C plus plus
but it's still I think for like C programming is basically is
readable lah you can still read the code ah like for example I think the lowest like out of the worst I think like S language until
involves like how
what is it
oh okay okay eh never heard before eh
even though I am a computer science
C hash eh
I think it's called C sharp ah
ya so the hashtag is it ya actually C hash is it is a C sharp
ya so basically all these programming I've learnt before lah during my during assignments or project during university when polytechnic
ya so I think in terms of
most companies do have like you need to know lah this kind of
mostly low level lah like C sharp python eh sorry C sharp uh what is it called ah ya C plus plus
pearl so mostly because I think it's much more stable ah than the newer technology like
for example we say like newer language
ya golang
ya G O L A N G
golang also is like basically is like
so I think mostly the their syntax is like similar to C
ya which is more structural typing ah more structured
ya
mm
how do you spell logs
oh log ya ya ya log in log in ya
error eh
ya
mm
ya ya
ya
ya
ya
I think
a'ah
mmhmm
ya
ya nobody use eh
oh
mm
ya
mm
oh
oh okay
like
ya lah ya lah
clementi house
ya because they are
oh
ya true true
but you never never contact them
but you haven't contact them eh like never contact them
yup true true
uh the rice and
I think I need to start learn I need to start to learn cooking ah
but it's a bit hard ya it's a bit hard
I prefer to cook alone ah
ya
nearby lah
throw the like it's just
ya not much
ya it's not in the fridge ah it's like dried ah dried ikan bilis
ya
ya you you need to get the fish ya fried first ah
ya
it's homemade ah homemade ya
ya
ya capsicum
I think the
ya
but also maid also it's not that cheap ah
cannot cannot like that ah I think most women nowadays is they prefer to work ah kan but depends ah eh
ya
mm
ya
mm
so take turn ah
oh
ya
okay
ya for weekend ah
ya usually once a week kan like sunday
like
ya sunday off
ya
ya of course
mm
ya it's similar ah same as when you go to grocery
ya
then you are like it's like shopping ah
ah it's a virtual ah everything is virtual
ya you cannot be real ah I mean impossible ah but its similar lah it's almost similar like
ya it's like it's like someone
it's the same as you are shopping ah it's like you you are really shopping
ya virtually lah
ya very interesting
ya I think like imagine like walking ah
like you are even grabbing food you use your hand to grab kan
why
access to shopping mall eh is it
mmhmm
oh ya
but I'm not sure like like the walking stuff you can just walk but like you don't have to walk literally ah I'm not too sure ah there's a button to like
move fast forward or what but I never try before ah I never try using like I I don't think so I tried before
ya but quite quite interesting
mm
ya
so we are living like like nowadays people are working from home
ya
the manager will ask ah like what have you done today like it's it's the same it's like the sprint ah sprint adjust chrome
where you go everyday task
ya standard meeting ya
ah you also need to be involved in like zoom zoom meeting
for presentation
ya of course ah I think they are going to make one in singapore kan
ya
ah but I not too sure ah like I heard from the news ya and they were hiring ah mm I think a lot foreigner ah
oh ikea ah I don't I don't think so actually I don't buy like
so maybe I might go with him lah I'm not sure when maybe next week
which one the restaurant ah
of course ah open lah
but they limit ah they limit like
ya they make
one one table kan like ya seat of four or seat of two
ya couple family kan
ya
ya
oh counter table ya
oh
mm
ya yup understand
not too sure ah
oh
shopping mall eh is it like shopping mall
oh okay
ya ya
open concept ah
it's like open concept ah
mm
ya
oh ya ya
mm
mm
ya
mm truth
mm
ya
ya
restaurant or bar kan they they have a lot of
ya
ya lah
of course ah
ya
mmhmm
ambassador
ya
ah true ah
I think just make sure like everyone just follow ah cause now nowadays people like
but but how do you want to like the is it they got come on to let in is it began when it's too many
ya
to keep track
auto check out
I think possible lah just that location wise is a bit some ah some ya ya true ah some some ah some might be insecure a bit ah like
to be in track kan
trace I think trace together ya trace together ya
trace together
trace together
ya
ya it's good
ya I think it's battery I think a lot complain
ya definitely ah bluetooth ya
through the app
ya I think in the background it's still running ah it will still run ya because it need to keep checking kan
I'm not too sure ah I think the the own algorithm algorithm to detect ya it's very hard to minimise ah so I think they need like support of
I think so ah I think it's just the bluetooth ah like because bluetooth will detect the nearby device kan
ya this is not this is not easy ah because because I think they still updates ah they're still updating they are still improving
for apple kan and google
are you planning to to switch to android or what cause now you are looking into iphone kan
Google
oh
android
mm
oh google home ya
ya
ya
who
google home okay
ya
mmhmm
yup correct
ya
ah ya ya
mmhmm
oh
ah
mm
I think so ah
the microphone is how far
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ah there's something
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
like
ya amazon products
ya
oh
mmhmm
I I think I not too sure also because never really use these kind of products
I think not too sure ah like they have their own ya they have their own brand ah I'm not not sure what brand is that ah
maybe maybe they collaborate hmm
I think there might be lah not too sure like
ya ya ya true true
and also I think most of the things in our house ah like or what like
ya
ya because
they use leg
ah pedal pedal ya so they have to use
uh our hand lah our hand to press the button
ya
paya lebar ya I saw I went to paya lebar
oh
ya ya
mm
oh ya ya ya

K
what type of superpowers would you like to have
if you were to have one lah
so I think you can start first ah
why batman and iron man specifically
so it's not a natural superpower
it's a man-made superpower
okay
no because when people ask me right at what type of superpowers
that I would want to have right
is like
ah kinaesthetic
ah kinaesthetic telepathy invisibility ah
not those
like
iron man and superman
ya I know I I mean as in like it's a different perspective lah
batman
can help others
but like for me is basically
oh so you want to be able to fly
then teleporting is also good
no it's not a
mm ah
ya so
okay
since you talk about teleporting something that I really want than I can teleport to like
harry potter there's this
where they they can only
like teleport from one place to another when they come of age
with a superpower I forgot lah what's the the magic spell
if not they have to use the port key or something like that
port key harry potter thing err port key
like
an object
where you touch and then it will bring you to somewhere else
you watched right goblet of fire the one where they went to the irish err irish mountains and then they touch to go to the game
robert pattinson
ya that one
ya actually superpowers right maybe magical powers ah wait wait but I also I I
if if I
ya I know but I want to answer my part of the question first like if I had a superpower
ah if I had a superpower
I would want to have telepathy
ya but
K but maybe
ah specifically to children ah because I really want to know
what the children are thinking behind I think it's a occupation hazard ah
like
what is going on their brain
so you I think will be very interesting
I think also works for ah
adults ah
um but the thing is that's why I say I want a switch on and switch off button
by what I hear which people that are reasons why people keep it deep down inside
okay ya so that's why I say I want telepathy but
ya lah but
teleportation ah
but it saves time it's very quick
mm
ya ah but the thing is
you are saving time
teleportation
please lah don't cut me off lah the the thing is people want this teleportation thing to
save time
so that's why people want this lah but if you are not the type to save time then better not have it lah ah
ya okay
so that's teleportation
err
um if I were any superhero I think I do not want to become any superhero
I think money
burdensome
ya
but money to me do it is not everything ah
ya but just to me that
wait
but giving away also you can't give away blindly
so that's why right to me do it is not everything to me kindness
helping others because helping others doesn't mean that only do it you can also help others
ah your energy your smile and your
sorry occupational hazard K ah teachers have superpower they help people
they help young kid
for a kid right
a kid will look up to you and think that you are a superhero
I think you know
how
our son aydin
would look up to us
ya
would look up to us if
if we do something for him then
you can really see
wah you can do this for me
ya
so
do you agree with me
mm
mm
all
I think maybe because of welfare
unlimited ah okay
orh
unlimited money unlimited wealth sorry
okay
wait then I have another thing
sociology perspective eh
work hard themselves
okay
mm
okay
err but I okay lah maybe for you kan
K
but I oh something came across my mind lah
ya I know it's just
a superpower
ya
mm
showing
the other side of ya
mm
okay
that's you were saying superpower
I was something came across my mind ways what if
superpower of unlimited
knowledge
mm
I will like that I would like to learn everything about the world but again
might be burdensome lah
yes no the thing because I was thinking
why you until now right you cannot find the perfect
get the like
bull's eye
of
medicine
so
wouldn't that be interesting
ah
ah the bull's eye of medicine ah ah
cure
for different type of diseases you can
cure for
diseases like
cancer aids
diabetes
and such
yes
ya
vaccine
I think you should make it
but also
subsidised
subsidised
then that one you have to talk to the experts ah
which is probably also the one with the superpower
but the thing is I
I will make things transparent
ya
that's the problem I think now
no the thing is right
ah not everyone
ya you cannot please everyone and ya cannot please everyone that's the moral of the story like you said
superhero
your superhero power that you wanted was
doesn't resonate with me
I like and I knew when I said that I wanted
unlimited
okay so
eh so that's about superpower lah
how about okay
how about we start on magic
okay if magic don't want okay and then what what do you want to talk about
since you are coming about superpower how about
superhero
ya your superhero was batman and I iron man
one superhero that resonate with me
okay and I'm still thinking of which type of superhero that
ah
or because I can
that is just lah
mm wonder woman eh
is okay wonder
okay can I I I will start with wonder woman woman wonder woman is
ya
ya lah
so but she can do oh she has that lasso of truth
that can
catch people when they
about wonder
orh
okay
ya
so
but anyway they revive her
him
it is a clone
oh it's not him
but the movie is not out yet that's why I do not know
so the villain made the clone
eh then that's boring man
eh but they are supposed to
people view online lah
ya there's ah people be ya video on demand
people view
no not apple lah then only apple people
only iMac
mm something like Netflix ah
extra lah then technology is already so fast pace
but is it
Netflix
ya lah
okay actually kan I'm not too sure how much
no
actually like
movie korean you're alive in zombie though
movie korean ya alive and zombie though
like
wah
how
as in like they don't
oh I know okay
maybe
mm
mm
aiya
mm
okay
like ridiculous ah
mm
ya lah but
ah
because of time
mm
but you must understand my my feel
okay the thing is I told you already kan
runs very fast
no the thing is the details
if I want to know
I will read about it
ya or I will go back
like you know I have a lot of things to do
like
ya lah
and
uh
so that is my stand on why I'd like to fast forward
superpower okay
oh now what's what superhero is it
what superhero
burdensome
no we were we were talking about wonder woman batman
mm
mm batman eh
mm
batman eh
ya lah
ah the thing is I I've not
ya
henry cavill ah
no the latest superman
to me

mm
no lah the thing is
the question is burdensome ah
to me I see no flaws in captain america
no thor
mm
it's a reality lah
of course lah
mm
the god of thunder
it's okay to have flaws
mm
mmhmm

mm mm
ya lah
but the superheroes
that

ya lah
ya but that is like a whole other universe a whole other topic
ah
mm
okay
and
huh no
as in like
this is like life's basic
ya lah
ah
ya
superheroes everyone is a superhero in their own way

the world of the marriage
ya I did but I watched halfway only
cause so draggy so boring
I feel like they could have just settled it within like the first five episodes but they drag it all the way
no lah I watched until the end lah eh no I watched until almost the end
but I think I stopped like
I've got like three episodes to go I think
why
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya lah like draggy right
ya ya the new wife also psycho
so that's why I only watch I skip until the last episode then I saw the last episode
the new wife left the husband right
ya lah because she fell for the psychiatrist right
she fell for the psychiatrist right the colleague
I I think the guy like her that's quite obvious what
uh huh
oh is it
mm
oh is it I didn't see that part though I think that's where I skip
mmhmm
I feel like they could have finished in ten episodes
because it's so draggy
ya
the what they ask for is system set the standard ah the standard ya no the standard lah because like if you see
on average most of the dramas are sixty episodes what
locked can you please lock the door
like the story line lah
ya ya I got bored I didn't even want to finish it
ya I still prefer the old dramas like what I'm re-watching the princess hours
did you put that
no I watched there's a few versions right
I think I watched the nineteen ninety seven eh
ya I don't know ah that one also I never finish
it's very rare for me to actually finish a drama I get I get easily bored
no I'm not it's not about being busy it's I just
no I will like I tend to switch over very often
ya but I keep re-watching like
I don't know I find comfort in watching old drama that I've like watched a thousand times before
ya full house also remember
the rain rain right the actor
that was good
mmhmm
ya the other day right I went to the clinic at choa chu kang
but then at the same time because the doctor was very nice so I ask him lah like if he deal with
which contains like vitamin A or something ah I forgot what he said current sixty plus
but then the thing is I googled right website they handle err severe cases
mmhmm cystic acne
oh that one I don't know
ya
so they referred her
but how's the payment like ah I'm on I'm on tight budget seh
but they they only accept cash ah they don't accept like medicine or what
ya but but you don't
you should
you should wash you should use Cetaphil
the exfoliator
why
ya
but this one also is because
of last weekend
cause I didn't hydrate myself after drinking
is this one is cystic acne then after that it exploded but the ones on my forehead it didn't
ya lah
but I also but it's because of period
but my forehead I really don't know
then
then you want me to get married to fix this
ya because your hormones balance off what
all your hormonal shit like happens

half a year I thought that I dropped out you know until like half a year later I talk to him about it then he say ee no that you didn't
ya I thought I dropped out
cause the the way the my mentor said to me was
like you don't have to come anymore I was like as if I dropped out ah but he she didn't tell me that my dad called them to just pull me out of the course
whatever lah
mummy but it's okay I have no regrets honestly

clap ah
okay start
is our first time sia I quite nervous I'm so nervous
okay okay I think your phone needs to be nearer ya okay err just now we had our chinese lesson
so um like coffee bean was so packed ya so but no choice lah we really tried to find a place kan ya but I was also very sleepy ya so what do you do in the err sungei buloh
how many friends did you go with
is it the the malaysian guy that you told me about before
oh
then you all didn't decide to grab lunch or something
oh
oh what did you buy
he was he was singing then I was like wah in my heart eh is like like bursting tau ya so I was so happy to see him singing and like being very cheerful cause like I told you that time err he was a bit down and like err demotivated kan
so when I like I heard him singing then wah like I was like thanking the god like don't know how many god okay I mean I only worship one god but ya I was like oh my god I was so happy that he was happy then he started walking also like I told you he hasn't gone out of bed for like I think at least one week ah ya so today was the first time that he walked and he was walking in front of me also
your face ya so ya lah so they were encouraging him to sing more lah cause they were happy that he's happy then err he even he was like err cause one of the nurses one of the male nurses is called his name is rex he's a filipino guy
so he was like rex I'm going to dedicate this song to you and like all the nurses in this ward for taking care of me and then he was singing the all of me song ya ya john legend I cannot remember ah all these names ya so ya lah so they were they were like some of them were singing with him also like while they were doing um I think doing his blood test and all that
ya so like I think I think as a nurse also if I were if I were the nurse also I'll be super happy like this patient like in a way found their motivation
ya
okay I'm done
err what did I have for lunch ah oh ya because I was talking to haziq until so long right my breakfast end up became becoming lunch ya so I ate my nuggets and fries at around like one eh eh no ya around one eh no
no no twelve twelve sorry
ya I that's my comfort food
mm true I agree the ya those two dollar chicken rice two dollars nasi lemak at those are it's like a god send
ya correct even though it doesn't come with soup or like doesn't come with I don't know like err but the portion is decent ya the portion is decent then err the taste also not that bad ya so ya I I've been eating there quite a few times also
oh ya ya no no sorry I digressed and now I'm talking about um just in general me eating there because I love that place now ya choa chu kang
ya is near the the the the old school bubble tea shop the bubble tea shop that's only like one dollar plus only
ya ya ya but anyway ya that was in general I love that place ya but if you wanna ask me about lunch what did I eat for lunch yesterday let me think no I didn't oh okay I remember I went to oh cause I okay yesterday I was supposed to work full day but I took half day ya so in the morning I was working
ya okay so anyway ya I wanted to try the burger king you know why cause there's a new snow cheese snow cheese burger
it was surprisingly better than I thought it was gonna be I thought it was gonna be a fail because you know usually like cheesy stuff like I mean other than cheese fries a lot of the cheesy stuff usually they fail cause like um it's not enough cheese or like the cheese is like fake cheese or something but this one is like they really use I think is mozzarella cheese cause when I bite into the burger right the cheese actually pulls
ya and I have no idea how they make it lah so like like how they can like make it in a way so cheap cause mozzarella is not that cheap ya then ya it was good then after that I went to gym then after that I went home to shower because the gym in choa chu kang doesn't have a shower
later like what time
err the burger err I ordered the meal then I added forty cents for what ah I added forty cents for onion rings so it was I think a normal burger meal is eight dollar ninety cent
ya so are you thinking of getting one tomorrow
ya
ya nice but I think right after trying the mozzarella eh no the snow cheese burger I kind of still prefer the swiss mushroom eh the mushroom swiss burger cause it's saltier and I love salty food
ya don't know ah it's just like I I like it that way ah
ya then what did you do in the evening yesterday do you still stay in
oh
where
mm
mushroom soup how can mushroom soup be salty
what as in like is too clumpy
oh okay okay okay
oh
oh okay wait what is this cafe called again
is it is it like the
but is it like in a mall or is it like in the middle of nowhere
oh wow that's interesting um so why did you guys want to go there
mm oh ya since your friend has a car right so what did your friend order then
oh and that's enough for him
mm
mm oh ya I saw your friend before he's like a teddy bear
mm
then after that you all didn't go for dessert or anything
I think so ya oh I didn't know there was a drive through there
you and your mocha
mm mcdonald's drinks are always sweet
mm that's nice so so he pick you up from
aww that's nice
ya yesterday I just went to the hospital oh like after I gym then I went home to shower then after that I was feeling pretty lazy lah honestly so I just err ask my brother ah eh can I take the car or not then he say can go and take ya then I took the car I drive to I drove to
so I was super scared about that so like err when I reach there right it was quite empty like quite a few cars parked there lah to be honest so like I was not too worried but then to be safe kan I just parked right smack in front of the lift
nasi ah sorry I ate the lor mai kai then I ate the then I order three siew mai
ya it's damn nice right for some reason that lor mai kai got the like the wok hey taste ya oh my god ya so that's why like wah I think if I go there again right I'm just gonna keep buying the lor mai kai
I didn't see anything at the ulu car park ah parking lot exactly so ya some more hospital kan ya so I was super scared then I just like okay never mind don't think about it
okay let me let me look at the other prompts
eh
I hope that we can play badminton later seh
ya
ya too windy I think too much but I think
so that err they all evaporate faster something like that lah I have no idea how the science works ah ya okay let me see what are the prompts um
okay if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
damn ya that's super deep I I didn't expect you to think of that
ya you know mine on is like super shallow
damn what who who is that celebrity
oh
ya that's true
that is a very is hyorin right that is a very response is like a very well formulated kind of answer ya
ya
mm
oh damn
sounds very black mirror kind of
in what way can he help others
damn you say is the boy is it how oh chey
I was expecting like you know like a seven year old boy oh
damn
it's like it's like robin hood in a way
robin hood I mean takes money from the rich and then gives it to the poor kan but he does he does he do that like like that style or he does it for his own good
mm wow that sounds very deep ya I realise you really like watching a lot of random netflix stuff okay um do you have any other topics to talk about
no right okay wait I know I know I know I feel like this question both of us can answer okay what labels do you think you have been given by society damn son this is a very deep question
in general
I mean you already out of school so
mm stereotypes ah
ya I get what you mean ah ya is a bit err a little bit offensive ya but I think honestly for that one it doesn't really affect me the one that I always keep hearing is oh you malay ah you in uni ah oh so you are one of the what ah a smart malay ah they literally label me as a smart malay
ya I don't know whether you you experienced that before lah but I got it a few times especially even some of my friends who are currently still saying it then I'm just like damn keep quiet guys ya I just ya lah I know I know recently also like especially during um the circuit breaker period a lot of the hoo-ha on these racial slurs and whatever has been going on
ya like like what what is the rest like of my society like how to say like by fellow malay people doing that like we get such a label ya like I don't feel like I deserve it
do you regret choosing your current path then I'm like am I supposed to is that like a serious question like I I kind of felt offended like why can't I just go and do something that I like ya so err aiya don't know lah I don't know why they asking this kind of question so I I just I mean it was a job interview so it's not like I can retaliate or something
ya then I just like ya it's just something that I've always wanted to do customer service ya then she was like oh okay okay okay but ya like like quite sian ah to hear these kind of comments ya I just hope that one day because now now like our generation more woke already right ya so I really hope that err everyone will try to like calm your tits
ya and just like try to I don't know be more mindful of what you say lah
he's on what on the ship oh
ya that's true
you know like that question also like made me think of this one situation like I'm not sure whether you know but Mendaki has this initiative like for um youth mentors to reach out to in a way like at risk youths ah
so I was interested because at that time I had a lot of spare time so I just sign up lah because err even though to me lah like even though you are only in a way impacting one person's life as a mentor that one person is gonna be grateful to you like for in a way maybe lah inshallah like for the rest of their life ya so like the impact even though you can only impact like you only have like such little impact in your opinion to this person
ya so like I remember that time when they asked me whether I had any concerns right I did ah I suddenly thought of it on the spot during the interview cause like for me like you know for me like especially before this I the way I speak was very english she find ya very very
straight laced person like from primary school to go to secondary school some more it was a girls school then from girls school go to err and then from go to uni so like it's something that I scared I cannot relate to to the students there because they are very different from me ya and then like
like I I don't know ah like I just cannot cannot handle it lah ya so I was just I ask them that then they were like oh don't worry lah I think from what we know about you right now at the end of the interview they said that like it should be fine ya
it is lah ya cause err one of the mentors was telling me that like err he was a he was a mentor a few years back then he said that like one of the students that he was mentoring ran away from home and he slept at this mentor's void deck for like three nights before he found out
oh damn we have been talking for like fifty one minutes
ah ah okay let's look for one more question mm
okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
isn't education free eh
that's true but technically also isn't it like
wouldn't you think like if
if the students work hard enough they're able to get scholarships to such places scholarships or bursaries are existing what right ya
I can't remember what's the other word ya like you know the the diagram of the like people standing over a fence then ya ya ya that that um analogy lah ya so like equity and equality right if I'm not wrong equity is making sure that everyone has enough resources individually
the customised amount of resources
ya ya
but then like for equality is like when everyone gets the same thing ya ya correct ya so like some people giving getting the same amount of assistance compared to someone who actually needs it more like may not appreciate it more lah ya I think is quite hard to differentiate like that lah
ya oh my god my throat
hey oh ya okay then for me what was the question again ah
um my first answer is food but that's not deep enough I tell you if free eh food is free right I will just I don't know why I would I would become a snowman ya okay wait let me let me try to think of a deeper answer um if something was free ah can I say time
ya
like you have all like literally all the time in the world
yes I want like you know like there is no such thing as time like people do not age people do not grow
is a like like your parents will be alive forever ya I mean ya lah like in a way is kind of what I will like you and but at the same time you won't savour moments as much ya wah it's like being immortal I cannot like I think I think I'll be super bored leh if I were immortal
no oh my god if I were a vampire
I think I will be a vampire because I get to sleep all day they go out at night I don't mind
ya cause like vampires ya you literally just be lazy ah okay maybe cause I just been watching a few movies right but vampires actually do nothing then like they just um and they have like superpowers that make it easy for them to hunt ya so like life is easy for them lah basically
aesthetics ya sia okay that's true that's true
I don't know and werewolves are ugly
unless you are like taylor lautner unless you can shape shift hmm will the werewolf be the shape shifting one maybe will be quite fun
okay no I think I will still choose to be a vampire I think in general vampires are a more accepted society no breed more acceptable breed in compared to um the werewolves ya cause werewolves is just like literally animals
ya damn okay then um I don't know would you rather be like

okay K
so like
and after that
so actually she was he was
behind
and after that like then after that
so when her ya then ya
like like is he okay
then after that err she own a shop like after she was like okay that she have a eyesight back ah
then after that when
he she fell in love with ah
ya it was like really funny but it's like so sad I don't know to me is like sad
but the ending
ya then he was like are you crazy like wow I kept sobbing you know like going out the cinema then everyone was like laughing at me
then I'm like oh my god I cannot sia
you know that then how about like your favourite show like that
hey they removed already
the girls as in like you know ah
cool what actually that's a good movie it's a good show
but then as they grow older like they become more like social
mm
a'ah
ya that's true that's really
mm
mm
ah ah ah a'ah
ah like cannot fit in doesn't look who can
mm
wah that's a good
that's a good show
serious
no what
what
there's like
mm
there's
okay lah
wah
oh that's a good a'ah seh cool
and then ya cause of the circuit breaker you know cause of the circuit breaker lah I don't know why like I suddenly like got like interested and I still remember like few years ago was like I'm not going to like
get into this K pop style of thing it's like
I will not then after that suddenly like this year look at me now
and then like at first at first I got like
interested in K drama then after that suddenly now I'm like into K pop ah ya I mean
now ya
they don't really care
no because no that time that time I went home and then
I bought three album for eight dollar
ya that's so cheap then I'm like okay lah might as well then after that go like
my group just come back so I bought
oh
by the way right then this past few days two weeks
I've been going to like cafe events I told you that
I don't know where is it but I's near bencoolen and it's like oh my god like I would like recommend go there like it's ten out of ten to me it's like
the place is so aesthetic
like the place you really like very nice it's built nice then it's like the food is good
and I also like the event was like fun I just had like I had a really good time that day that day ya I mean there's like three places I've went one is like oma spoon
ah dhoby ghaut there
but then to me like the best is gather the misfits ah cause like this like plus eighty two cafe is like very plain but if you see if you go to the gather the misfits right it's cool you know they got like the fan art thing at the cappuccino something there made
ya and also like
I thought it will be like twenty dollars or fifteen dollar for just a waffle like waffle like sometimes
no but like I went to like haji lane before then
ya lah so I thought it was gonna be I thought it was gonna be like that but then the waffles are only like seven dollars so it was like affordable to me lah
it's not bad the drinks also like okay I see that
no it's not it's near
I forgot what is it called farrer road farrer park is like near the blue line there I don't know what but you have to walk for seven minutes
ya but then the place is like
I don't think like a lot of people know because it's like
around there is like factory something like that ah like it's not like
tau
it's not it's not like that it's not near town all that so I guess a lot of people
ya
I want then after that I look at the the plus eighty two cafe right then their event like damn boring then I'm like then then I got like a bit motivated I'm like eh maybe in the future right I want to like
I'll open my own cafe
ya lah maybe maybe maybe like I don't like

I'm not so sure I think what I I have a feeling probably it's an english school or what lah I never I heard lah I forget to ask what's the
the name of the school
ya
uh huh
yup
oh
okay wait for the place okay
okay okay okay I just now this err today lunch I ate at jurong point do you know that jurong point there is like a japanese kind of like halal place do you know
ya ya ya no no no no it was at err along this err
the swensen's all that lah that was that
I don't know
probably I think so ya
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
we we finished already we finished eating so we just pass by there
err
ya he just she's not into that kind of food lah I I think so lah
eh three daughters
like the the eldest one is like what twenty three twenty four like that
so ya lah
that's that
tomorrow err tomorrow tomorrow
uh
oh then after that the ya
then no after that no more already lah right
ya
okay okay okay
okay we see how aiya ilan madrasah
slippers you mean
mm
mm ya
oh okay
ah okay lah
okay
oo ya
oh
ya talking about her ah
oo that day and that time we meet up right
then because she she work at this ya A star right
A star so very funny funny story ah because err
like let's say today can be ten sample so you know you you work from
think there's a timing lah but the timing is also like err odd timing or like you know when you finish you finish ah
you go in at this time but they know it's so called eight to five or what whatever but
but if if you finish early means you finish early lah but sometimes
ah they go off or sometimes
when you work late ah you have to finish late lah you can go in like you know I can finish at I go in at eight then by ten I finish then can go back ah
not that bad ah
or sometimes you need to stay back then you stay back lah right
cause got so many samples but her work is like two days work two days off ah something like that or
something like that lah alternate so we and sometimes weekend she has to work so
what happen is err I think
to so called finish up before because like if my batch morning batch right I will just do the morning batch right maybe if morning batch like let's say I cannot finish ah
err I have to like you know I have to
I have to let the night shift know lah and then night shift if cannot finish right the morning have to come in early lah to finish
being a leader then have to come early like that you know and then I never get get like you know extra pay or anything
then she oh then this one ah I will ask sani to become
but she was there she hear hear hear hear hear ah kan
but they don't know that she's there so then after that she come out ah then after that she like go out ah then she like alamak aiya I like I also don't want ah to be leader you know
so I think she's she's like more vocal and everything lah kan
so among these two is quite obvious that you know
ya
ya but the thing is I don't know I don't know this one because they are like contract ah
ya contract not staff
you can you can like so called call yourself a leader you know
like like this lah you put in extra hours lah you know
ya it's a good it's a good thing lah it's just it's just that
she's not say she don't want she just like err worried that she cannot the perform the job that kind
ah ya
ya
ya ya ya
so the thing is like she's not supposed to know
like like like for example ya I want to quit ah and then if like okay you quit okay then who want to take over you ah hani ah hani can and
ah ya I know I know ya
so weird right probably
then like err
probably ya
ya ya ya
that's why so it's ya that's what the thing is
mm mm mm
yup maybe we should go there
art ground also ya
oh then you better check lah
mm hmm
eh
mm is it
ya ya ya ya
who who who just said ah I remember one of the maid does that
where is it ya
yulis do that can't remember lah that maid do that
so anyhow ya
oh I don't know no no ya okay wait
uh ya ya ya
kan
oh
you you you
know he has been sleeping late because ya every ya every night I come back
uh the light will be on not how
so I just
okay
okay
eh
so ya so probably what the art ground so think lunch at home lah ya probably lunch at home
I don't know that
oo okay
discovered ah
so I no no more already ah I did I did buy something like for myself some potato chips I think potato chips yes
then there is chocolate also we got chocolate right
snickers at the end I never I haven't tried
um
no
mm hmm
need to book what where where where where's that
where's the place ah jurong west ah
jurong west where
I don't know I don't know
I don't know lah seriously
group ah
like you call yourself like oh what from the ex black hole
if if I'm black hole I will sue them man
oh is it but I just I just find it weird lah
because it's it's like my brands lah
okay you you want to advertise ya I I I think I have to be upfront about it lah
like you don't use my brand ah
like say eh I'm from err Adidas like that one Nike you know
ex Adidas err it just logo right basis like shoes right
ya but but I think it's just because our context like singapore is too small I say it's like ah
I say like I'm I'm ex you know
I don't know I just I think like he
I just feel it like it
come from like you you leave me and you you open up the same thing as me you get what I mean not
so it's like I I leave
my
agency and I set up another agency but I still leverage on err that agency's name I think it's just
if you open up something else probably lah but I don't know
ya but you took to advertise I don't know
advertisement ah like you know right it's ah
if I if you are like the owner how how do you feel
ya ya where were you from oh I used to work here okay lah
it feel like advertise herself as that is the header lah
I'm from like ex ah
okay
I I think it's it's maybe not right lah
ya
ya so so many things err
ya
okay
okay
okay
oh
ya
oh
oh
the
okay
then his shoes his black shoes how ah
this one this shoes also quite new ah I don't know whether want to sell whether want to
then you sell and buy another shoes the one that the friend gave you know
right
never use lah that shoes
ask him to use but I think that that his black shoes still can use eh
but I I ask him to eh never wear this shoes what he says what
ya according to him lah I don't know
ya
oh that day got one somebody enquire about the
the japanese shoes you say you want twenty bucks then I say thirty bucks
then I say like thirty bucks lah you want I say oh I need to try I say come lah you come and try lor
then no answer already
so ya
mm
ya but I've been keeping it and not wearing it also so it's
no because the thing is to be honest the shoe is quiet big for me ah
I think bought err like
so I'm wearing err a nine point five but that one was a ten
eh
big big because different ah I think the cutting different certain shoes like like my Jordan I'm wearing nine but certain shoes I wear nine and a half
but
what I do right now buy shoes online right I would like go and try first
try first and after that
ya try
so this is my first time lah
okay
yes

oh okay so it's like
oh okay so it's like half an hour ah

ya see whether can
soccer boots soccer boots
actually can
can but I don't know that one is it's
right
what ten dollars
ya the soccer boots you should lah
err
ya because the thing is when I buy it's also second hand
so I don't know better
ya but I bought it second hand
that one I bought in so I don't know whether this one
authentic or not authentic so I really don't know really
because I went to the cobbler bukit maju right
then he say eh eh actually I got another shop at just wanna try it on
then I say eh okay try
I have two boots
I fix one boot then I buy another boot why ah

uh
okay where would they do they wear the the thing on
oh bukit panjang
moved bukit panjang
oh
a lot of people looking for like err big property that's why I say
there's the demand and whatever not you know
probably want to look into that ah I think but you know but then again um
and that's to you and your family lah you know
mm
ya but I remember that that day she said what and
um then the agent that time you say oh already see like that so
I'm not sure whether they want to revisit that again and over there
oh okay

then from there
like okay the next one okay so now whoa really really can sell then if sell then do what you know
err at least we know what is the option there lah
how fast you can sell that is the different right
like you know what are you going to do next just gonna like you know um checkout or you're just err gonna like you know get a new one or what you know
ya I don't know
mm
so ya these are the I think the few things that err need to know upfront before we can err
then
if it's just like eh ya you can
ah still not no plans to move
end of the year or end of the month ah end of the year ah ya
I don't know man and never make any arrangement that is fifty over plus family already have like so far make arrangements to leave lah
that's like the singapore like plan private I don't know lah these people
thought ah I I I got no idea they are
because because
no but I I uh I I think they will give in notice like know three years ago something and then after that these people I don't know what they gonna do
like like those kind of movies then they stand there then bulldozer come I don't know
ya so
mm
I like the the the the the the
have some power nap in between but I don't know when
I don't know when because ilya come back I need to buy the sandal
ya then shortly after that need to like err
ya from that time until this
ya so really when can I sleep late ah
like you know whatever we talk just just stay there already lah like you know don't don't ask around
ya lah
um
what
so ya lah

okay can
hey you aunty
I'm doing okay
you you then the pain all you can feel it
you were alone in the hospital
sister are you a single mother
alright it doesn't matter lah the what mattered is the baby is there ya if the baby so what happened
oh really ah so you only dream like just the you giving birth process only lah
oh so you didn't but then you say the next day you got dream some more
aww
could you feel like the maternity love already
ah like a responsibility ah
then when you wake up from it like what do you feel
so so now you want to have a baby in your life
I don't know I feel like it's very weird cause I don't get this kind of a dream but like somehow you get this kind of dream is like I feel like it's a sign but I also don't know lah what is a sign
ah ya ya
whether you are responsible enough like yet lah
okay cool sis so anyway um
you know ah later I'm going to go err have a job interview
then this job interview I'm having ah is asking me ah all type of weird questions one
come with our own answers so that later at the interview I will know how to answer the person lah better
okay so the one of the questions the like interviewer asking is um
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago what would be inside
ya lor
mm mm mm mm
oh
err but then your diary would it be like rage or like would it be like reflecting
ah so okay imagine yourself at eighteen
raging
ya ya ya
ya I remember you telling me about your friends they're like quite toxic right
what would the okay then if there's a time capsule from ten years ago ah what what would you probably be saying to yourself
oh ah
which you are kind of okay okay or not not at all
ya ya so long ago also
me ah I think ah ten years ago I was sixteen right
oh
ya I was already outside mixing with the outside people so probably ya and I think
I don't think I was also depressed or lost or anything I was just very like exploring life at that point of time because
ya like from julie I met so many people and then also I met hakim or risahd which is nothing to do with julie meeting him at sixteen was a blessing sia like if I didn't meet him right
activities are very lah so it's very good as compared to like if let's say I was mixing with the same kids still it's not really good right because like they drink and everything
and then like I might have boyfriends but with hakim also we were just friends so it was really good and then he will bring ahmad along so we go gig we go um
so I think if I were sixteen probably what I would say to myself and I broke up wait I haven't met amin yet so
probably I will say to my sixteen year old self like
hello girl girl ah
eh you how are you still you still got boyfriend or you no boyfriend I hope whoever your boyfriend is you happy lah okay
err are you still longboarding err probably all that lah probably asking how is she doing in life like me now
and if I think most probably my sixteen year old would just want to know whether I'm happy like ya even then I think happiness was just my aim it didn't it didn't matter like
what I was doing in life ya it just mattered like I was peaceful and was happy that's all
so ya if I will say to if I read that then I will probably tell her or him like
I doing good yo I'm doing super good
ya I got this shit ah I mean it took me some time but twenty six is the year yo twenty twenty I got my shit together
okay okay so
the other question they will ask me ha is the
um
walao eh got so many questions you know they ask
oh ya ya ya what is the pettiest reason you would dislike someone
okay
but that's so like normal though
okay lah okay lah ya ya but it's also very human nature I feel
ya very petty
what what other things would you be petty about
oh
a'ah ah
but does this apply only to like your is it friends or contacts guys or like what or people in general
guys ah right ya
cause if girls like you know it's nothing personal right it's like you
ya ya ya
but with guys it's a bit more like deeper also it's like rude hello you're a man okay I give you my time
oh ya lah ya lah
ya ya she's just making your life difficult
uh huh uh huh
walao eh why she like that one
like how dare you block my way you want to fight is it huh you want to fight
me ah pettiest reason ah
err pettiest for reason for me to oh my god
even if I dislike someone I don't think the reason would be petty like you know me like the reason has to be so strong for me to like not like the person
okay lah petty reasons like just not say hate but it's just like aiya like dislike a bit ah ah it's like our dearest lor
ah like like she never do anything like outright to like harm us but
like it I guess the pettiness is coming from like the way she talks like the way she talk like it's it comes off as like
if ah like at work there's this engineer he's not the same department as us
so ah sometimes I will fall asleep so who's fault is that it's my fault right not supposed to fall asleep but ah
ya that's true okay but then again it is lah correct lah it's our fault we shouldn't sleep at work I know that like it is a like common sense thing
but ya but then ya lah it becomes petty because ah whenever I see him now I don't like him only because everytime I fall asleep at work
I will get traumatised and think of him ah like ah no no no later that guy will come and scream at me
ya
what other reason could we be petty about like not liking someone like it's not like hate like not hate lah right just like annoyed
can
oh is it like what
oh ya ya ya ya I think me too also I think everyone lah right
ah
mm
mm
ah ah oh oh oh
oh because you were julie
oh cause so she thought that whole thing was messed up lah
ya because she didn't know like the true story and everything
ya ya correct correct that's judging it off
ya ya ya oh you mean she said hi to everyone except you
oh I think she's one of those girls that's like if I don't like you I'm not going to fake it like ya that's it lor
ya lah ya lah for me like I think the pettiest not pettiest lah this one is not so petty I don't know whether it's petty or it's um
okay petty reasons people might not like me in the past ah right it's just like
like some people like make up story about me last time like the name the nickname don't want to say here
then another person will just take that nickname and be like oh is it okay lah then I also don't like her now even though they don't even know me know then like
what I do sia I don't know I just come sia so it's like
and then it's just because of the nickname I had last time which was wrongly like portrayed by someone else
so I thought that was very petty I think another reason why err ah like I got it was also a petty reason why like a girl didn't like me last time in class ah was because
the guy that she liked in class like me and then after that err her guy best friend also like me then then she don't like me but then you know what's the worst part is that she is like
best friends with me in class one not
ya ya like and then like
ya then eventually I found out that eh you know ah she she say ah like she got say to me before
why why all these guys like me lah ah she said her tits not even that big my tits are bigger
that is just shows that I have small tits and guys still like don't you think it's something to do character rather than your err physics ya exactly
okay so far it's okay
eh but then ah she took the worst vengeance on me possible you know
one year later she entered the same as my boyfriend at that point of time I didn't know that they were the same then they went overseas for the to bangkok I think
then my boyfriend came back right then he confessed to me he sort of cheated on me he touched this girl he touched this girl then
he touched this so he touched this girl then after that he tell me he touched this girl because um she said that she's a lesbian so he touched her boob to like prove her that she's not
you you stupid or what she's not lesbian I know lah she's my classmate then lulu like always go around with like the different key went like got mad at me because I went out with guys that she like which I didn't even like you know or you care about I didn't work with them like they were just friends but ya then I was like crying to my ex-boyfriend ah like you
go around with like the different he even like got mad at me because I went out with guys that she liked which I didn't even like know or even care about I didn't go out with them like they were just friends
but ya then I was like crying to my ex-boyfriend lah like you
especially because she knows you are my boyfriend
wah I like never felt even more betrayed at that point of time
that such a person exist that can be so
so ya lah but like afterwards I don't feel anything for her lah I feel more sorry for her that she had to go to that length to get man's attention
ya like going to that length of like ya I've never been touched by a boy before like girl I know you did you know something with my ex-classmate
that was an interesting time like like if I see her now like I won't be I won't hate her lah but it's more of like a bit disgusted
what she did back then but ya also like like just hope that she's changed now lah it's just more of like
mind blown by it like walao eh like I could never sia go through that trouble for man ya lor
so ya petty things ah huh that people so it's not really I petty with people people was petty with me one but it's okay this is life I already got used to it
now they petty with me I'm unbothered one
alright okay this one is if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
mmhmm
oh mm mm
ya ya
oh my god that's so cool but you can already play no cannot eh
a'ah ya lah ya lah
err can play a lot of things siol can play the piano keyboard ya still got one more
it could be anything in the world like even if you're not going to use it as often but it's just like uh so it's just a random skill like oh you so you can do that then you're like ya lor I can
oh that's great sia like you don't need to call people for shit anymore
and save money also
and then I'm like die lah ending and then you're like no I can do it then I'm like oh she got the spirit
I love how mine got the random red like when I'm very excited
walao eh confirm can one lah it's just one line don't be petty lah we're just talked about being petty okay so
ya okay for me right
obviously the first skill I will take is cooking ah
then it's not just convenient for myself but it's convenient for like my loved one like if I want to cook for my friends my family so I think it's a very useful ah skill
second skill um
so random ah but I would pick up sea sea diving eh
mm so fun sia
like in general I've uh I've always been intrigued by the sea
like that's why when shai like her videos ya tioman I always feel like wah best sia ah like I want to
but even before I know that she was inside I already had friends who already went inside so I've already gotten like that kind of aspiration where oh it's very doable you just go tioman
ya but so far eh you know can touch the okay okay cannot touch the coral but you can see kan everything so so first is the cooking so I can be master chef for my family and friends then second is sea dive so that I can be relaxed in the water
if I could pick up
ya ya
a'ah a'ah ya
correct
so it can be done you just have to learn
alright sia then like that you do not have to have talent you just have to have correct and then eventually that can be talent also
hard work correct and that eventually that can be talent also
that's even like more hard work talent seh because you were not born with it you worked for
okay like that I will take the singing lah
but then I won't be singer lah like I won't have that much free time
I'll just be me and my friends like guys I can sing out some karaoke ya lor
okay good to know I feel like I'm getting to know you better as a person through these questions ah
ya lor ya lor
how do you think oo
ah
hmm
light effect
alright um wah if you get a chance to wake up as an actor okay I need to prompt if you get a chance to wake up as an actor one day
which actor would you become and why
ya lor
I know right
okay this one is the actor is the very everybody will know one
oo
correct correct even though his true personality is so reserved and mysterious but he can in his
he really manages to err exercise different parts of his like personality through like movies
ya lah ya lah you skip that part lah
no you you now if you wake up as him now he's already over the mishap people the whole world know him already so the
so you must say this so you must explain
mm where is it okay which actor one day which actor you want to become and why
alamak you kills
oo
okay his singing career and also I think he made maybe a few booboos but then again kan he's young
ya like we at that age also we said a lot of stupid things we are cringey
but then I'm like you all shut up lah you all young
ya it's not enough to ruin what he has already done so far at umbrella academy sia
ya and makes him human ya
he's still eighteen
ya
going to paint history
he is even more powerful sia season two
ya
he's so weird he's creepy like okay you all you all not cultured guys ya okay so for me if I had to choose one actor to wake up as
I would definitely choose joseph gordon levitt
people will know him as tom err from the five hundred days of summer
it's because why is because I think he is honestly such a brilliant person like
he is doing his own like company for the past several years where
he's so amazing lah like he gives platform for like like independent like artists all over the world to showcase their work from like
so he doesn't use like existing like people who is already rich no he wants to give everyone a shot and like ya it's called hits record
he was sharing ah and then everybody will send their entry ah so he really picks up tendon from anything and anywhere and I find that so inspiring and in fact I think he's been sprang to me even since that friendship just assemble I like how work he has been from the start you life
ah he will share it ah and then everybody will send their entry ah so
he really picks up talent from anything and anywhere and I find it so inspiring
and in fact I think he's been inspiring to me even since that five hundred days of summer I like how vogue he has been from the start of time
like even about his character like everything about him right to me is the equivalent of the most unproblematic
man on earth and I know he's married lah but he even then he's so low key about his marriage and
you can tell he's not just also married like a woman just because she's hot but he's married her for her intellect and kindness and everything
so I would love to wake up as joseph gordon levitt to just be in his mind and see what he does and everything
so I'd love to wake up as joseph gordon levitt to just be in his mind and see what he does for err everyday
okay eh no but then I would also choose johnny depp but if I were to choose johnny depp it will be more for his
I learnt about johnny depp's err wife not wife ah they never married ah vanessa paradis I fucking loved her I was so obsessed with her
and I love his kids and everything so I would probably wake up as him to just
he okay another person okay sorry this one is also this one is also actually quite epic ah if I could wake up as her right is also really amazing
angelina jolie
cause she's also another like inspiration but like girl version lah actually I love zooey deschanel but I think angelina jolie has a bigger impact on the world lah she's like
and then on top of that she's a humanitarian like the devoted humanitarian and like
on top of that she's angelina jolie like even if she didn't do all that humanitarian stuff right she's already awesome because people will love her as an entrepreneur
but she has all of that even more so it makes her even more like humane ah even more kind and imagine your ex-husband is brad pitt like the fish
so I would love to wake up as her and just also see what she does in a day ah like I think she's so inspiring sia like she's a mum to like
all types of kids like you know from vietnam to africa then they all really consider her as a mum she allows her kids to err explore religion and see what is beneficial to them and
ya she's connected with like different parts of the countries like of the world the third world that even we have never
she's even connected more with muslim countries so like ya I would love to be her sia for a day I think she's so inspiring like even though people love to villainies her because of the whole brad pitt and jennifer aniston thing but I feel like
that's so little compared to what she's done correct
ya at that moment I know it must have gone down so real but then again that's like twenty almost ten to twenty years ago
and then like with jennifer with because with angelina she was already like wanting to have babies and like settle down whatsoever lah
but whatever it is ya lah like cheating cannot be justified lah right it is still wrong but
I still feel like brad pitt and uh angelina as a couple still made like more good than it was bad like not just it wasn't just for them but it was like for the whole world
even because of angelina jolie brad pitt also became more humanitarian and did stuff so like ya I really love her as a person
like she's a gemini so I was like sia lah a true gemini sia this girl like she
she will be like she will seduce the the host and everything then make them criticism like sia that's like me but like back then lah when I was reckless lah so
I really love her so much because she also still has this really like you know vulnerable side of her
so ya jennifer ya and angelina jolie and then the actor joseph gordon levitt wow
ya oh my god you imagine if you can wake up as a K-pop artist though
imagine if you wake up as your uh stray kids or like
what do you mean
ya because ya you have to be super disciplined
if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
ya ya like ya if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
caveman ah
ya
okay okay imagine so so you
ya if humans don't have to work to survive what would you I think I don't know what about the thing
until I die
oh maybe okay like so meaning transaction there still has to be transaction or something but it's not money anymore
so people has it you could be entertainment like you need this give me three dances
ya what is your capability what can you do ah can you give me a massage
but I've already got three hugs from the girl before can you give me something more than a hug
err I can't
err no no no no okay okay okay take all the food you want
no lah it's our opinion mah
we're not talking about the government we're talking about the opinion
okay lah obviously I appreciate like whatever is on channel five suria like they they definitely gave their best but I'm just saying
oh my god imagine
it would be so epic sia
I think it'll be so funny because
like it's not meant to be funny but because you know like in singapore characters in general can be so
walao eh
ya lor ya lor actually the races do get together when we are against like a specific
but then ya lah for but then the ones that was be standing at the answer end was like no ya where ah
ya what's next what's next
how do you think humans you will become extinct let's take this question in a sense that is we obviously know how lah right cause of islamic so
take that we imagine like imagine that's not the lah so it's just purely in our imaginations ah
ah how do you think humans will become extinct use your wildest imagination
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm correct
eh my god I can imagine sia my one is the zombie
then after that err getting comfortable
then she becomes the first zombie then she bite her the husband she bite the child
no eh but then ah you know the singapore and is like connected by that that
thing right I don't know I think our our government will
okay says my imagination right is the fast type but they are allergic to water so they cannot swim to singapore
will train each other how to kill a zombie in case they will come everybody will be prepared it's not just the army but it's like everyone
but ya we got army for that so our army will be taking care from the inside the borders and kill all the zombies before they can come
so this is why like singapore becomes like the safest place to be at because we are the smallest
malaysia will spread to indon indon will spread to like the portuguese and then to thailand and then to eventually lor
so I think I give them one year or maybe one month lah then the whole world will die except for singapore
maybe singapore eventually lah when but singapore will be the last lah to die I will give us
ya I will give us the hero
so we will start the rationalising like crazy lor so we were all lose weight very drastically
oh okay obviously at each country oh ya because this one humans were extinct right no hope what so no choice lah everybody will die eventually depressing
alright
ya because of a pandemic seh
err
ya
mm ya lor
uh anyway
what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
oh my god eh wait wait wait but is activity eh
but then it ya it has to be an an eight hour straight work we're already doing eight hours so it's just like err maybe a normal activity you do but imagine you have to do it for eight hours damn
it doesn't have to be something you hate so it's just like everyday activity it would be torture if you had to do it eight hours
ya like okay so we're on to this the third round ya
next okay next
ya
eat damn slow lah like one rice at a time cannot already I think ya exercising definitely lah like sia I imagine like running running for eight hours
everything what other thing maybe is the err
but that one is like quite therapeutic sia sometimes too ya
ya honestly sleeping but then sleeping you know eight hours
ya
sleeping is always eight hours also you don't lor I'm willing to torture myself for eight hours if it's sleep
what other things that we do like everyday activities sia
pee imagine like someone force you to pee for eight hours
pee some more pee some more I can did I try
produce more lube liquid
how how many more minutes
I think around twelve minutes
uh uh
if you
if you had if you have any unusual superpower what would what would it be
what
walao eh
and it's not like it's not as such a major thing that will ya change the rest of your life
it will just inconvenience them for like one day so it's like a good good
ya lor then we just like then we just like diarrhoea
then he like ugh okay nevermind you
ya it is the most innocent
like revenge but it is a useful one
how did you think that at the tip of your mind it must mean you have had thoughts right
would you want the unusual power to be like see the ghosts
but even then he was so depressed for like so many years of his life he was so like schizophrenic
but this one even more sia you cannot sleep in peace eh you sleeping there lah then like then got hi
then another one hi the patient will like uh shut up
you all want to talk to me can I'm going to control you
please entertain me now
ya he was very that's why he became like a drinking drug addict he wanted to run away from all the ghosts so irritating sia like everyday every second you have to listen to them talk
so many exactly
and some are nice and some are ya and they're not visually looking nice
alright okay so
ya lor who know you got the dark secret but ya lah I think seeing ghosts is more of like a curse than it is a blessing ah
but I mean there are people out there who can see third eyes so I hope they have it fixed in their life
ya ya ya
you mean like there's friends who will fake it
ya lah
but it's too dramatic ah
girl or boy
ya ya ya
how old is he again ah one year older eh or your age
oh
twenty six eh twenty eight
oh nineteen eighty nine that's quite old
see how is he doing our you know uh it's the same uh the popular do example in boring know holiday get social media guitar but the girl number but marching to jackie either look ya ya time right my checks you know okay so for me my unusual super
is he how is he doing now do you know
aunt allyson has eh is damn
ya eh it's damn strong sia babe you can literally manipulate the whole world
but it is I mean it it ya but it can be quite messed up if she was villain
luckily she's not a villain babe if she's a villain she can get everything her way
ya lah so that's why I said unless she use that power only
and not to make someone like or someone whatever situation worse ah
I would love that power
okay you're now going to be mature I feel like we can't do that because
then we plant the seeds for them so that's why we even with the robber that I said just now right like let's say he was going to rob someone
I could have said okay you're now going to be a good person starting tomorrow to me it doesn't feel authentic from him
so that's why it it has to be like okay from today on you going to reflect on yourself why you're doing this and you're going to question the
purpose of life ah so just plant a seed and then see where they take ya I think for allison
I mean it's not her fault lah kan because like with that power nobody knows how to really use it what and she had to go through her downs for her to like oh shit to ya learn that
I can't use it but then again eh honestly I know her ex-husband hated her cause she used that for her daughter right
the what she asked for her daughter was kind of a small thing what it was like a
I heard rumour that you don't want to read the book anymore
everytime they reshow that scene I'm like so graphic
I always thought she died seh for good right
but the it's like she's just what the fish sia
oh and then he's said oh why didn't you use this earlier so to what get you like clothes wow
ya and you are the one who preaches about being the change the movement and then like
and then you are the same person who's like so did you use it on me like
ya
ya
I feel like allison is compromising a lot sia she's so nice like nah
seeing the way ray treated her I'm like at least luther is genuine sia and
he loves her as she is he so cute when they're so awkward
alright
okay so maybe last question
what is the one thing you wish was free
oh my god
mm that's why
okay ah
oh my god you're so right
ya lor stay here forever lah
but that's the thing right
ya but you stay at your own house mah
okay maybe maybe not rent maybe is buying a house because rent right if it's free how to say ah it is still like monthly right so if you buy a house it's free like
no one in singapore is going to buy a house it's like automatic when you're twenty one a house is registered to your name
like okay at twenty one you are all
err entitled to a
then it moves to okay twenty five okay if err twenty five you are now entitled to a four room flat
but ya bro that was a that was a good idea what else what else could be free I think
damn cannot lah seh
then will be like
yes why do we have to pay for something that will be with us for ya
ya lah I get that like the factories did all these and they have to be paid but I mean I don't know
do you really have to pay like
condoms okay lah
alright uh
what do you mean what you mean person interview a political up all right
oh right right right right okay eh I get to know you more lah seh babe from here

it's just one jar
I haven't check yet I haven't call him I don't know he said uh help him sell all he said I can take to sell all his wife accessories that
she never use before then I said okay but I will take some time to take pictures of individual of or I mind individual items
I don't know if I have time I's like
we're having task here and there I I don't know I'm just I'm going to put aside first lah
no he he ya lah he meant that way but I don't know if he wants me to sell it he got the profit of it or he just giving it to me
uh
the
email right
not yet
nope no emails yet
not yet
it's not yet lah I think sooner probably I think maybe waiting for teachers
no they asking about you but okay lah
you all go and make your own plans lah we make plans
and after that we still need dessert and we still need coffee is they got so many things to talk about
you lah
what's yours
must be the crumbs lah don't know how many time we must wipe the table
kids
it's like having crumbs all over the place
last time
is it end of the year thing is it
I I expect you to go to the one at bugis the bigger one
ah that's
hospital
then for your
next check up you still go back to the same place
oo that you mean they they give you to the the nearest to the house
government
eh
you have to wait equipment first ah
oo I thought they pay for you
who
huh you know you have a friend but you don't know who
oo
oo
you saw him or he told you are
oo
what you mean they have different different team eh
err
okay lah think can you can make it lah
ya lah
lah whatever comes first we you I mean you grab first lah while waiting for something that you used to do
lah
later the zoom
you do alone eh I I don't need to join you okay
I really expect her to stay till she's taking her she's a very good malay teacher
the first to teach err tasha
get the malay students to love
malay
he makes kids love malay through music through fun he make it fun he make it very fun
and
so that's why I think it's a great loss err and she's there I think according to tasha it's like what she's only there for three years
so tasha was the first batch that she thought
last time
she's the lucky one lah
uh
tasha is
he six no that was like two years ago no only she's not check three yet no
tasha is the first batch she teach three years lah
three years eh five years
ya initially tasha doesn't like her what
but in the end
a'ah see
her class what
almost everybody got A and A star
I only worry is nadia she pick and choose
it will affect her this what I notice ah
headmistress
she's like
trying to avoid I guess
next year is gonna be heavier for her
ya she needs to move around lah
because I think
tasha tasha also what
at first I don't think she would love dancing I mean
the moment she start she cannot stop
which now you don't expect her to dance lah she's got no interest already
nadia my my worry is what what else other than adventure club if she can't then she is she gonna what stick to they're gonna have this thing like like now
I doubt so right
like sports already can start then I think the rest should start already right
what's the sports that you wanted her to join or her teacher wanted her to join
rugby
what's that oo tag rugby
oo touch rugby tag rugby
sounds fun
I think that day when she try out the lego not lego ah the robotic thing so she she kind of like it right
ya she's she needs to be active lah she is like she is active since young so
she's daring lah she she has the confidence
can lah let her try lah
this cycling also let her
in the store
individual no
I still the store lah tasha tasha hardly use it last time
ya we have a park downstairs to play let her try downstairs lah
no need to go so far
there we have grass patch if not
we have the whole set what knee pad
elbow pad helmet it is just that I don't know whether the I mean it should still be okay lah
it belongs to tasha or belongs to her
then it should be able to lah and tasha use
should be lah it's kids size what
no not motivated she's more of peer pressure people know how to do she must know
eh she's she's that kind of person that
that's why she's in certain class which is I find it's good when her classmates are like that so she put pressure on herself
err going bishan on friday
I need to pass my sister all her stuff
going bedok saturday eh
I know that's why she said come on saturday because she's not going to jurong so everybody's there
sunday is a brothers in law second marriage
eh
they detect eh this saturday wow it's handy
so fast
oh ah
I need to do my report soon
no you soon
you get better
eh today's is what
nineteen
today is nineteen see
I'm not working I still can get the dates right
I buy something lah
later you get tasha to I think we have nuggets hashbrown finish
fries finish
nuggets only then maybe if you want desperate lah
the boys yesterday refuse they took only coco crunch I think they finished up the whole batch ah
the whole box
try try not to give so much ah they're coughing
haris haris haris coughing
so I'm not worried they drink a lot of plain water and when they cough they look for water which is good
very discipline very good my boys are good
I just told you to cut down on chocolate you want to give them nutella
up to you lah see what they want to eat
he eat breakfast lah
don't know why I'm meeting her also I think for her to message I'm meeting her at waterway lah but she haven't message me
peck seah P six
so that's why that day she message me asking me when do I start when do we start err preparing P six I say when you are in P five the teacher will start torturing the kids to not torture but they start to prepare the kids for P six and P five is the most crucial time lah the where all the
a extra classes are and homeworks and homeworks and homeworks
and then up to half a year of P six and then by the time after second half of the year you see the teachers all start to slow down more on motivational motivate motivate the student is more on mind ah if you ask me
let them not tell them to relax but
then I told her you want to start having tuition and everything start now
but they have they have tuition what
amirah's err siblings they have tuition
ah
I thought amirah go for err oo visit the youngest one I saw the the grandfather was sending her to
uh but math class
my only worry is nadia's math I mean ya now she's average ah but the only subject that I am I see that she might need
to work on
ya
I thought
she always
she can easily pick up
but we need she needs guidance
and I I think when the time she's in P four I don't know whether I have the time to teach her so much
and one thing is tasha cannot help much also with maths
at least science
err english
malay
not so bad
I don't mind lah
at least if we start her early because we started tasha like only in P five
right started tasha with five
hmm
or unless get the same tutor as natasha
unless get the same tutor as tasha
ya she did
okay lah
together
oo
K
um
yup can
god
received the message eh the email tau
ah
because I only have class dojo
class dojo is like only
apa
find it weird
duchess soon I think double lah when they send you parents gateway then I also got it on class dojo
mister po everytime I receive message we said oh
so that's why I ask her wait your your teacher never eh set one set two same so I don't know where set three is
other classes because of subject bending
mm
they try to natasha nadia also don't have any changes
eh but I don't know lah eh
hmm
three and four together correct sorry

right
can
oh okay
ya
ya so you basically you don't contact them directly so usually how it works is that
your wedding date will be available then um you can
choose
eh I think you want to start back or not cause I just realise I got a lot of red bars
is it
okay so basically err when you
what's that called where he lives is also err stated on the website ya so but usually what we do is we we you like you can actually go down now you can even go in and then you just choose a a random date
wedding date within the next five months and then you just um
correct yes you cannot do it you cannot book in advance but you can go in and play around in advance lah ya
ya you can see how it works so what
you to finalise your booking yes you have to wait until the date the date that you want is available but you can actually do it now as in you you can go in and then you can preempt
like for me
oh then okay I don't know whether there's a charge for changing of date
I'm not sure about that but there is ah amendment there is ah basically um when you choose err your wedding date then you within you can just go in cause what before you you you press confirm you can actually
change a lot of things ah
I screenshot then send to my my my my dad then send to lina everything kan send to both sides then
haven't ya I I so I went to fill up the entire um all the details so that err being a typical singaporean ah we kiasu one so err once err once my date is available straightaway on that day itself I book
yup
yup
ya
because if I'm not wrong you also you have to you you also have to book a date
when you want to go down to if I'm not mistaken ya
sought after ya
ya is it ten is it oh okay
okay
your scope ya your scope is is smaller lah basically
ya but nowadays I think no one really
no one really bothered by is it I don't know
he's okay ah
that's one thing also but
doesn't know how to read the situation and drags on like you know ya things like that lah but
I think I think it doesn't really matter I mean
cause okay
so if five months out you book then they contact you they have like five times four
times how many weddings in the day you know that kind of thing like err like they're they're very busy lah so you have too many people to to to contact so but usually one month to two weeks before I think they will contact you
so included me and alina
what you're supposed to say ya
so
ya cause I I grew up in a very english
speaking environment and so ya
with different lah
yes
ya so basically I say for example today you check right then you check out the
the latest date you can book
then if you want to be safe
you just choose like a random wednesday or thursday ah you just click on the website then just click click click click all the way then before submit then you oh close the window
ya things like that lah but for me is like I just wanted to see what I need
ya there's a submit button ya correct it won't go through yup so basically for me it was because
um
I forgot how it how the time slot is I think it's a two hour time slot if I'm not wrong
if I'm not mistaken it was a two hour time slot so it was it goes like eight to ten ten to twelve
that kind of thing ya
ya hot lah ya but for me it was I chose the eh no I chose ten to twelve ya
ten to twelve ya
um ya so but nowadays people do it all in one day so it's different ah mm different ah
wah I don't remember whether there's any charges eh
okay okay
don't need one not necessary ah they won't they won't try to pressure you okay okay if
like what is um it's it's I would say it's
maybe twenty percent religious based eighty percent
ya so I told them err I I've got work lah they will they will still will pressure you then oh but we have classes on weekend and I just told them ya I work weekends and weekdays
so okay so when you go in no no it's when you go in then after you do the interview with the the head of
ya so then you have
you can ask the mother
ya then you just bring the parents ya
ya
I don't know whether it's free or you have to pay I'm not sure is it I don't know so I the thing is I didn't even bother to go because a lot of my colleagues and my even my aunties are telling me it's
not necessary they have not gone before initially I thought was compulsory
but that word everybody thinks that oh it's compulsory but actually what do they mean by you what they mean is that you should go not you must go that kind of thing ya
ya
for me it's
ya for me it's not necessary I had the ice cream cake in the end what ya ya ya for me it's like cause I I went to my friend's wedding I thought my friend's wedding had wedding cakes
I didn't get to taste like I was the groomsman I was the best man I didn't get to taste the wedding cake you know I I don't even remember they are giving out the cake
that that's the thing
some of them had the three one of my friend had a three tiered cake I don't think I've tried the cake like and and and okay is different like when you have a non a a non traditional malay wedding where the one is seated and if you have a hotel with an itinerary everyone watch oh now it's a couple's video like you know if it's if it's if it's a seated wedding a a wedding cake make sense
wedding cakes is at least at least a few hundred dollars ya so if you want it to to look nice and then everyone see but then like if half of your all your guests don't even see it then what's the point kan
mm dummy cake ya correct there just like one slice is here but I I would say err like
it it defeat to me lah it there's no point to the whole to that whole part of it lah like even
ya a lot a lot of part of the way cause I I I was the best man for three of my friends wedding
all my all my friends are guys so I'm always on the groom's side
depends on how many how many how many outfits to change some people change three outfits ya so it all depends lah ya so
all weddings there will be time time time delay
really
ceremony there will start at one thirty
then she's like I think we should move off now
kan then I need one half hours to two hours you know when you signed the contract she'll say I need one and a half hours to change on the day she will say I need two hours to change that is that kind of thing lah cause you also want she she also wants to like make the the bride as pretty as possible she doesn't want to rush I understand that but but at the same time on that day for my friend's wedding eh eleven thirty she said we should move off now
okay but that is the girl side my friend I'm the groom I'm the best man right my groom my friend
paid for the food at this mosque that he didn't pay for the food at that at that location what how would you feel if after your entire wedding you you didn't even get to taste the food that you paid for
correct she's not being selfish in on her end
fully lah it's selfish to a certain extent but it is more of like it's for the benefit of the bride I get that ya I get that but but at the same time you cannot
there are confirm people there are confirm malay people who are that
ya ya as the as the bride and groom you didn't even get to taste what you what you paid for cause my friend had a live err a chendol station ah everything like in the mosque everything lah quite quite nice lah he paid for everything
then ya lor then he didn't get to eat that's no way man
you know
yes
no cause cause maybe initially her thought is um itinerary wise the bride and groom should be eating at eleven fifteen
for me lah is I'd rather have them eat their food ya you have to be flexible lah in that sense for me like that's the most important you have to be flexible
yes transportation is is the problem to me ah that's why I wanted everything in one in one place ya it it you waste time in terms of moving from one place to another yes
ya exactly you don't know the traffic yup you don't know yup exactly
how no no no no yes they their eh they they might be thinking of like I don't want to I don't want to extend one hour so that you have to pay me one hour you know that kind of thing they don't they they probably are thinking that way lah you know that they want to save your money and
different person different lor ya so usually but most of them have like an eight hour package and then if additional hour you know one hour plus that kind of thing ah they won't they ya they won't delay some even would look give the next one hour free
err I got one two friends who did photo shoot at fort canning two did at bedok reservoir
ya
ya
yes
makeup artiste
but I I guess right that part I will leave it to dewi
like for me I leave it to alina like for me I leave it to alina on how you want to to but the thing is like alina also didn't have experience like but she had she has to do her part to do the research mah
like how much you want to spend I'm not going to like you know you can only spent two hundred like I'm not going to be that kind of person like you want if you think you need five hundred five hundred dollar makeup artist then you go and find the five hundred dollar mark up artist then you go and save yourself
like I'm not going to make you pay for my shoes you know that kind of thing like if I buy a tie if I buy a shoe is like eh I cannot be splitting it right down the middle ah right plus I don't need makeup but then if I want to cut my hair I want have a fifty dollar haircut then you like eh our budget twenty dollar then you will feel like eh I want fifty dollar my problem lah
I pay myself what that kind of thing ya exactly so what you want ya cause it's not a
don't know how to play with your skin tone because maybe she always do malay girls who are darker skin tone then she doesn't know how to do a light the lighter skin tone her her her her makeup box don't have err chinese skin tone you know that kind of thing ya then she she she cannot play around with it so ya you cannot really control like that lah ya
for me it's like let let them
like let them let her go and search through Instagram
mm salons ya can also you mean you can you can do that also but you can also
like I would say
not necessarily there are people who do that actually who do the like even the whole hairdo and everything and and and and do it there you you that is actually a a a decent option
um
mm
mm
of course now COVID nineteen you don't get to go to expo to see all the wedding err expo and everything kan so it's a bit different ah
ya so if you reapply makeup is a whole new cost
ya because they have to wash everything off then put put everything on again ya
that would be your wedding photography ah ya because usually people have a package like eight hour package that kind of thing lah ya
yes
it's a good go do that
but you also have to see I would say where you want to do it for your photography
okay like where's your location
if you do it at the peranakan house over there first first and foremost
it's on the sunday there's going to be a lot of people walking around that's one thing secondly if it rains
ya
mmhmm can do that also
err I guess so I don't know different hotel different
ya must sign agreement ya for me when I when I ask for fort canning I sign the agreement
but you don't you you have to ask hotels like some some buildings even if you ask talk about peranakan place lah if you want them to cordon of anything some places give it for free some people some places you've you have to pay ya so it it
exactly ya it is it's not raining and if it wet weather is all settled lah I would say
can I mean if the hotel has a nice pool you guys can do outdoor that kind of thing nearby the pool
I would say recce the hotel
mm can
I will probably be be booking a room at
the
indigo hotel next door
ya I mean like when you the the hotel is peranakan themed
ya so I don't know whether if you if you want to hop over there to take to take picture or whatever it's is fine by it's by us lah
ya it is quite nice also over there um on the wedding day itself lah ya
as in your wedding day lah I want to book the indigo room over there oh no need lah ya we we we we can because I I am a member
ya so I like to I like if if I if I have an opportunity to book hotel with the Holiday Inn group I always book cause can get points oh no need lah no need no it's okay ya cause my hotel the hotel is going to be just next door anyway is like one street away
ya yours is it the village hotel and the street just before that is the indigo hotel mm no need no need no need
um
I would say it's
it's very manageable it's it's it's you have to
plan it out well lah I would say err okay so basically
you have to see
mm yes ya so yes so how many tables you have how many guest you have and you must understand the turnover rate
so the good thing was my
me and alina did not see that coming like we didn't think about that but my decor
wah she the that that that girl is amazing ah ya no no no she she she thought about all this she says I you cause okay every table is extra cost
so if you open one more table is another fifty dollars for example like you know the table and the chair and everything so she said okay I'm going to give you about how many chairs extra
but
ya it's all it's all my cousins lor all sit inside ya exactly so but the thing is ya you cannot expect and everyone comes at a certain time at very early kan ya
ya a lot of them were my my colleagues lah basically my colleagues
but ya
ya so that that is one thing that you have to think about err the turnover rate how many tables you have how many sitting how many seats you have for eating and how many guests are you bringing in
ya so that's that's pretty important lah
we didn't walk in
okay
okay I will say I'll put it this way
if your ceremony is three hours book four hours
ya then if you if you if you have a four hour slot make your your entire thing three and half hours or three hours because no matter what there is always going to be delay like no wedding no wedding runs on point ya no wedding runs on point I've I've I've been a best man for so many wedding no wedding run runs on point
ya
like for me I I cause I've I've done a wedding where my friend
I was like
okay then how is it going to be done like what's the transition like
things like that lah
okay
mmhmm I would say you don't need to worry about the activity ah people will just take picture with you lah
can
I've been I've been to two weddings already this COVID period no such thing eh no one no one cares lah
my the recent one with my with my err sister in law's brother we did at err malay council
you know they walk through the whole restaurant
ya no problem lah
no need lah okay for for my wedding personal okay but the thing is I don't know I didn't do a hotel wedding so I I don't I I don't know oh but personally I don't think an emcee is ever required because they don't have a groomsman or a friend who who who can make announcement that's it
that's it you just need one person to make announcement that's it
no but the two weddings I been to also
a wedding emcee unless he's a friend
if you pay a stranger it's wah you got a lot money
to me lah personally
it's a wedding no one will feel bored I feel
cause for me it's like you do know that that that this event is not your event for me lah personally
exactly so if you want a formal one then all he does is just make announcements what
you can just get someone to do it for free you know or maybe you pay fifty dollars instead of you pay like two hundred dollars for a professional announcer you know what I mean
yes
yup we we make our own lah um cheaper
a lot cheaper
but if you want to make your own you have to do it early lah cause it's it's not fast job mah
yes you have to it yup correct
you have to do it like within next few months
yes people do one year in advance
no joke
like not not exaggerated at all people the most okay the way to look at it is right
how do you remember your wedding
photos right photos or videos
you do not want it to be a
half
half
effort you know what I mean ya
like you want it to be like wow
you you should look in look up for it a like as soon as possible people book it one one year in advance
err my friend got her
not only malay chinese my friend chinese she got her photographer one and a half year in advance
yup some people book the photographer before they book they got their wedding day confirmed
because some some locations like I think we got our photographer before our we got our location confirmed
mm but we book them eight months before
we can only book our location six months before
ya but the thing is like you roughly know one when's your date but some locations can only book six month out six months out
ya you have to do it yes
it's a very kiasu game
there's a lot of bridezilla out there
like it's a wedding is a very
female
demanding event I would say like the the brides will the brides will be like like alina throughout her entire decor
ya she she drew and coloured her entire decor how she wanted it to be what then she give it to the decor person the person you can do this person yes ah and okay we take you
but it to me it like it's a day that that they that that girls want want it more than guys I mean like in terms of the looks lah the the the
the physical looks of how it how it looks and everything ya so
but ya photography is important lor
photography is very important
I would say you I would say okay it comes to wedding photography right um
you wouldn't want someone who can take a picture
you want someone who has done wedding photography
ya that guy but the the younger guy was good ya yes he's very good
the elder one the one the one I got the senior one was a bit too trying too hard to be professional I would say
ya he know he he knows his angles and stuff lah I would say but I like him because err he listens to what I say
ah then after that then he he so he your when your aunties were up there the husband to take out handphone and take picture cause you know photographer just stand there so that that's the good thing about him being professional lah he listens to me lah ya
yup ya so I just walk around ah I told him to follow me ya no lah I told him to I say I'll I'll just go round to my my side so I went to my side to sit on my place then I asked lina to go inside then she like

eh ya ten dollars lah
just to err
err so corn is a one year harvest program lah something like that
ah so if one year harvest corn then one year later
how's the the the the the situation there
oh okay okay okay ya see I see I see then when when you come back from err batam I I know you went batam but I when did you went to batam
you went there for your business
I see
ah okay okay that makes sense I was thinking of why why you have to go through the whole long process then when you when you come back to singapore
twelve err november
orh then after that you have to quarantine for two weeks lah ah
so how how is the quarantine in singapore the people a lot people complain lah facebook lah they say not nice lah some of them I I I don't know but how how is it is it easy to come back to singapore from from batam or is there any requirement that you need to get
okay
ah
ah
ah okay okay okay so you you
batam from batam you take from harbourfront right you stop at harbourfront
but I'm not sure
mm
okay
very
ah it's just probably he never come back to singapore for seventeen years lah probably
ah maybe
ya lah too much lah this one ah anyway ah so your two weeks how okay everything
ah
ah
orh
ah
uh huh
okay lah
ah okay
ah so now after that you doing deliveroo ah okay lah deliveroo so usually what time you start for weekend for your deliveroo I mean as in food delivery
ah
okay
mm
oh
okay
ya true true true
you manage your own time you manage your own money everything is you on your own lah okay lah
ya true
talking about COVID no COVID
now already fifth december already another few more
days three more weeks dah end of the year already wah very fast man correct or not ah
alamak
ah
this is a new beginning ah they call it the new norm for now for I have the feeling that most of the people will get used to it and then by
don't know lah ah I just feel that this COVID thing is moving very fast I just feel like
it just happen like one month ago but actually now almost end of the year already almost one year finish already
correct
sixteen march eh
but but very fast ah nine months
then maybe january twenty twenty one I not sure I don't think can still travel in twenty twenty one ah that's what they said is probably two two lah so
so good thing cannot travel save money for this one year so twenty twenty two a lot of people will start travelling again
correct correct
mm
okay lah spend money in singapore lah staycation now government give ah hundred dollars voucher you take already
but you cannot book directly to the hotel lah I think you have to book to those but five platform only
the places that you want to go err places of interest or staycation
you have to book through this platform book online
before you finish your process of payment then you have to
click under redeem vouchers then it will redirect you to your singpass ah and then from there then you can use lah you can either you have to use a whole hundred dollars
okay lah they want us to spend money in singapore spend money in singapore lah but where to go I also don't know
I mean if you go because is until july twenty twenty one lah so there is no need to rush because
I believe people are all rushing for this december because is school holiday so if you are talking about using the vouchers during this period ah
eh
correct correct but I not sure probably COVID I not sure whether water cove open or not but then if you ask me to go zoo jurong bird park sentosa I don't want lah so all these places went already ah so I need to go something different ah maybe
use
use one one voucher to stay staycation two days one night ah maybe those hotel that you really want to go but you know but you don't have chance to go there but hundred dollars how much cannot
unless you go to smaller hotels lah you want to go those like hotel ah of course you need to come out still same price lah not much difference ah anyway
ya
ah
serious ah
government give us ah
mm
ah
ah okay okay I understand
ah so at least singapore is
so call we are lucky in a way that government is still taking care of us giving us some some rebates some help some assistance in terms of finance rebates for house rebates for electricity but other countries totally nothing lah
huh
so meaning for example if let say they government for example government say promise them one thousand rupiah lah example ah one thousand rupiah but by the time it reach them left maybe five hundred rupiah only then that five hundred go where along the way so that five hundred consider from one place
be quite too expensive or what
no
huh
so under table
so meaning
so meaning like how
huh I don't get it so meaning okay let's say now I I I go to hospital but I do not know my result
and then uh hospital just to get money from the government
they will say that you are positive then this hospital send this positive patient to where
to the quarantine area
just to refer one person to quarantine you get money what's the purpose why why
is better to refer a negative to a place to say that you are negative that means you are helping the economics or you are helping the country to lower down the cases rather than every person you say positive then if every person goes to hospital without checking you say positive then the number of goes up what then what's the point of
huh
bullshit
huh
I don't get it funny look I mean if if if hospital get money to inform the government that this patient is negative it make sense but if they hospital without checking inform the patient that they are positive and then get money ya
but it's better to get
more negative numbers in your country then positive what right so why is the other way round
what the
really happen
until now ah
how much how much they can get for for for for one person
oh that that is wasting your money I rather then you waste rather than you waste your money to just inform and get a referral to refer a patient to a quarantine area might as well get that money to help your medical in terms of
medical things or medicine to improve your medicine better what
funny ah
why ah like that
anyway
ya
ah ah
ah and then go and then he video call and then he wave at the wife using binoculars oh my god so cute
very the romantic lucky never go viral maybe ah maybe whoever pick up that story ah and then share share share share ah
I do not know ah shared that video of he waving at his wife both of them using binoculars waving at each other in opposite one is johor one is woodlands so cute you know but
do not know haven't go viral yet ah whoever pick up that story ah go viral ah
no lah he I think yes he no eh
this year ya correct correct because right right right
I think one is it one month or few weeks
before the actual err wedding then it comes out into regulation that singapore is banning people from travelling that's the part everything cancel kan for him
ask his wife to come singapore ah bring in
he is going back to johor
so he's
then after that he's
oh he is going back johor now
then
no pay leave two months lah singapore no pay leave two months ah
ah then after that bring in the wife come singapore
huh
oh ya if he bring his wife back to singapore not only him have to pay two thousand for
for two weeks he also have to pay for the wife two thousand so almost five thousand already
then going malaysia
how how long you have to stay
in malaysia if we go malaysia johor you have to stay two weeks staycation so not say staycation lah
but singapore
the the the cases zero what community wise why go there still still need to
subsidise lah
I mean if if if now err the malaysian cases went up from seven day if let's say from malaysia to come singapore you have to stay before was seven days right now because of the increase in number then become fourteen days make sense but if singaporeans wants to go johor knowing singapore cases community cases are zero now
funny lah they all anyway
it's okay lah at least happy for him lah at least you know see his wife
mm
investment lah it's good investment lah
ah
ah
ah
the two weeks
that one two weeks two weeks you stay worse
you never join the apps ah they got apps like zumba lah exercise lah yoga
ah then
I also do other things also at the same time I also helping my my
friend doing this err food
so now we are
for what
okay
ah
ah okay lah
ah
ah I see okay lah
ah so call like a whole set lah
ah
okay okay okay
so he did that also lah
but now because of this COVID thing lah
so for me nowadays you you see my new family cusina
oh ya ya ya
no no I'm I'm doing okay now what I'm doing ah because
I already moved to a new house already correct so now I'm doing a bakery
food halal filipino food
now I'm doing this halal because right I'm I'm looking at in this in this situation eh whereby if let's say you go to
thai vietnamese
since you can cook well why don't we do filipino
halal food because
there is no filipino halal food except
one company
jollibee
ooh
ah is a niche there is only halal filipino
cuisine from philippine there is jollibee even there is this called mexican and err gerry's grill is also not halal
so why not we do halal filipino food so it came out into the ideas what we now we are doing it like
filipino kind of place lah be it bakery cheesecake are all cheesecake muffins are all muffins right but
we put err err err
different taste local of a filipino taste lah so yes we did that already so alhamdulillah there's a few orders coming in for our cheesecake for our muffin and now being you know now end of the year december right so we are doing roasted chicken lemon pepper
home made ah
hopefully lah
a'ah
ah
correct
ah
ah
but for now haven't ya so I want to hopefully be the
hopefully lah ah be the first one to go and open of course restaurant wise still not yet lah because capital not not not there yet so now do stuff on home base first uh uh
ya because why I was inspired by this
by this lady they call it err
if you go into this that it's call
thai thai I thai ice tea okay
very simple what she she does is a she's a thai
of convert lah then she's thai she convert and then what she did is she sells crepes
okay lah good lah I was thinking
correct
true
ya lah
so ya lah so now I'm I'm I'm looking into these areas hopefully lah hopefully can can go into this small little corner to to to get something after you know all these
COVID thing a bit of loss of income ten percent pay cut no pay leave some more for days then it's like really like still need to survive being in singapore correct so I think hopefully it it it does helps a bit lah
so I I I I will add you don't worry I will add your I know who is this toklang right should I accept should I not this is a scam later somebody I also do not know then after that add already ah this one ah could you give me money this one transfer here oi so many nowadays so that why I worried since you say that is your account I will accept and I will add you
ah that's why I was thinking alfi already got the account what so this one is this one is err new account the other account get hack or what I also do not know but
I will accept that don't worry then I will add you to a dot J underscore kusina or kitchen kusina kitchen
ya
from the house itself lah so probably now also weekend right so nobody wakes up early what
right
then the order
okay lah but then
from ten to maybe two lah today
then
aduh
uh I thought somebody want to come out summon what
ya lah can one
then after this you straightaway go
do do grab already ah I mean do do deliveroo already ah
ah
ah
ya true true
and ah for me today oh today I think I go back later I still need to I just another order coming today banana bread with chocolate melts
that means the banana bread you cut that banana bread inside there is chocolate melts
whoever order this one because no I I do I mean friends or whoever wants to order from me right I mean there are
food I mean standard lah default default like I do this okay that means for example banana cake or I do strawberry cheesecake cups with blueberry cheesecake cups
so these are the standard item standard food but if let's say you want to have something extra inside like example banana cake is just banana cake so someone ordered
ashraf can I ordered banana cake with chocolate melts inside
can
the other guy wants the chicken which is
super spicy different from these three they want something like spicy spiciness how lah this spicy okay lah can lah I can do for you so it's
can be done lah not say cannot be done it can be done like muffin also we do the same what we have blueberry
we have err blueberry muffin banana walnut muffin
uh chocolates muffins so even to have something different can lah we customised to
your tastes lah ah ah so ya we do that lah alhamdulillah lah so today
there's order later five so still have time to go back
and then do cooking ya so we we try to do during I mean
uh we we can't take too much order yet because of
both of us working and then err you know so we
try to take those like during the weekend in advance lah so at least we we can prepare in advance the food the ingredient ya plan plan out what are the things that we need to prepare lah

long leave ah
oh
this year was like late january right
mid correct
ya
ya my ex-colleague
no iffah is in february then the other two's in july then my cousin is getting married is getting married on ten of july then I was like
postpone it
oh
talking about it I don't whether can say it here but anyways
I mean I don't know but ya okay but never mind I just say lah I think it doesn't go anywhere but what's this
you were from griffiths right
then you should know
amalina
she was from griffiths primary
your age
why would a guy be named amalina
I don't know whether you will remember cause ya it's primary school so I'm not so sure
mm
ya so you don't remember lah
ya
ya so anyways ya the cousin
my cousin got married to this amalina lah ya
yes
ya
ya but after that she went to err ngee ann secondary ah
and then uh
mm ya
oh angsana yes
ya
zhong zheng or
why ah
is it
that's why I don't understand why primary schools like are considered like there are better schools and not better schools I'm like in my head it's like it's primary school like how how better can better be
I mean children are still
so they depend on you grade lah
like to get to a good school but in my head like it's just primary school like how
how what how as in how good can good be and how bad can bad be
huh
tiger parents it's just parents nowadays ah
kiasu
mm
orh
orh
for for one year ah
one year
mm
how much is school bus eh
hmm
ya
mm
hmm
I think should be fine
I don't know lah should be fine
ya it's not red yet so it's fine ya
ah
nearly
then I have to move also
ya
oh yes I forgot that I got one good news today
and then like now the parents are working from home but they're gonna work from office soon so it'll be quite difficult for them to like send and fetch him ya from school that kind of thing
so I was like yes ah
ya he's present he's rent ya definitely ya but I'm thinking maybe
ya so I have got that off my hands so maybe it's a sign also that I should just stay on the class for another year
ya
the ya is him
ya not exactly okay it is him but like other children also but then again I cannot complain because all children are different and I should learn to accept them so
ya
and and and every and every class has its challenges so
ya
one one more year and then ya I'll leave lah
ya see how it goes
ya
it's like
amazing then I was telling her I don't know how you do it man like
but if you handle older kids also the downside is like the stress from you know if you deal with
older kids lah also it does affect right ya
so ya
yes true
ya
but for like my line is like more how to say um
ya
ya
older kids ah I think can but then depends also on
the boss and whatever not ya but like for her because her cert is only covers err
the younger age group ya
ya what were you trying to say sorry
mm
orh
mm mm mm mm
approval lah
so who decides
the deployment
okay
you see the teachers but you don't see the
people like rarely right
oh so they do teach
wah
busy ah
like
mm
trust me I think you told me before ya ya ya
mm
mm
it's set auto eh
mm mm mm mm
you say it's uh
ya
ya
ya
oo
ya they earn quite a lot imagine if a childcare teacher okay can earn three K max is three point two
ya so what more if it's like a principal a higher position
ya
ranking
so there's um
so it's like a just the level teachers so like
uh
I wouldn't say nursery is the lower level but basically just preschool teacher then there's a senior teacher who usually depends on the centre so there's a senior teacher more of like a supervisory but basically it's just the same thing lah just teaching and whatever not
ya so teacher senior teacher and then vice principal if your centre needs one then principal
and then err depends again on the
like the organisation that you are in so like last time I was in young school for kids above then
principal is err cluster cluster head
ya so cluster head is like in charge of like the few principles in a certain district or something like that
ya
ya so ya lah I mean basically you can climb lah
ya
it is a job actually meant for you to kind of
ya like my
for cannot
then you have to always be on your phone ah
ya after work hours there's no such thing as after work hours that kind of thing
no no no no
this world is not for us so
ya

how ah
uh huh
then I mean like like that one is not like small get together lah
it's quite filling
okay
okay unless we just keep it to five lor like
ya
ya
reunion school reunion
when
ah what was that one day
ya the
fortune cookie
ya
okay lah I think
should be okay with five of us right
vegan
okay can
wait when when is the dinner
oh
oh oh ya
mm
okay lor
then like that
we can dinner on twenty eight or twenty nine
at buffet town
hopefully
could be
okay
eh but you said at west
oh
we going two days one night ah
oh
wait twenty eight is err
monday sunday sunday lah I think it's sunday lah sunday monday cause every setup he got one weekend he needs to clear
ya
no I think it's sunday monday
eh maybe monday tuesday
oh rates
then he say it's like seven hundred online
the I was only four hundred
but how come it's just that date difference ah
oh
lame
speaking of travel
of course lah I mean it's so nice the weather is cold
no
okay
but when you went that time it's not the cold season kind of is it summer hais that was
global warming
too bad
okay lah but at least you went out so still okay
okay lah
then like that
hmm more or less it's
sort of confirm the staycation
the when do you think we can travel back again
oh ya
where where's the tunnel
no they say that um what britain is going to be the first or something to try out
mm
huh
ah
then what's the point then like that like
will there be constant people but anyway
okay lah probably
it's gonna be better
huh but then if like not everyone get vaccinated then what's the point
when you were young lah
yup
ya but I think also anyway like when twenty twenty one come also like I mean even when they lift the restriction
I wouldn't really want to go travelling
ya I mean besides being the safest lah is like
is it really
contained or like their measures are very
effective and strict that kind
like so funny cause
ah I was looking at this youtube um
the youtube is from america lah
yes
so it's like um
she
went to a nursery with
so it's like
then like that don't need to wear lah I don't know lah it's so ya it's it's quite mix
ya
ya
but anyway it's a very interesting youtuber because
she already got a truck load of plants at her house
there's a lot of different plants that um she feature lah
and then err the like this the latest episode I watch when I went at the nursery she bought like really a lot of plant
and it has thorns
it's like quite tall and like got the mickey mouse
no the normal one is
the succulent what no meh
no it's like
ah it's like a
um
I don't know
it's new to me so
ya then after that she bought this plant called cardboard plant
ya it's like um apparently when the leaves are young
like
ya so it's quite interesting I haven't google what's the cardboard type
but these are all tropical plants though ah
ya
I don't know it's quite interesting but it's
ya it's quite tall
yes
mmhmm
they say that got more
I think it's more
it's true what they say like
cause I think it's like um you see
in a
and like the
kind of like the flow of the
it's
I don't know okay like some places is kind of like I think is majority sudden kind like they don't like say it two months earlier that kind at a candidate for a week before ya
ya
so I think um
um and there's no leeway lah
that is for business that's like I think for personal
lives wise
I mean I was really enjoying the period but I think
for the personal lives wise
in a way the problem is in the sense of the old people
it like I think
it's not so healthy because
in their own way of keeping healthy lah so I think in that sense err that is that problem because once you enforce that rule of lockdown then it's like
their mental health is also at stake
they actually force them to actually
mm
mm
ah
okay is okay lah but I think before
like
the government should be able to understand what the what other main points first before really trying to go to the next step because like the solution to everything shouldn't just be digitalisation lah
mm mm
mm mm
err
burnt cheesecake
okay
true true true
mm
mm
I think
besides the domestic abuse also there are also like those um
like definitely their family size can be big for the space that they have
and then like
um minor the kids want to study and you know like there's not a lot of err amenities for them to study which are like the laptop lah the wifi all these things
so I think that was also an issue that they brought up then
girl in
ah ah
see I think like that and she's also quite mature so she's able to find ways to make it work for her lah but for like elders other younger kids leh then how
ya
mm
then there was also the scramble for laptops for the primary school kids and secondary school kids for those underprivilege also that was one big issue and
lot of computers then after that how are your studies are definitely going be affected
then
how so I think that is a problem
yes
ya
ya I agree with that because I think that time like
the grass is already on the paper already yes
ya so there is definitely a good time today lah I think there were also reports plus err like
the air pollution all these things
but I think maybe the better way to do this is something that should be
um
thought of
like
okay lah the lockdown is to really curb the spread
ya
ya
but then also you also went up because of the
there is also the downside that it should
be like it shouldn't just be
actually foreign workers are also singaporeans what just because
they are staying in living in singapore but they don't own a singapore
it's just a work permit I see but they are still considered as singaporeans what so it should be
um
encompass in all this care lah
but I think like
mm
mm
ya
ya even um
my grandma also is staying on her own
ya and then
iphone ten
but more physically lah so
err that
could be a huge toll and I think it's a huge toll
on their lives
mm
no lah I don't think so I think it's more on like the focus was to bring down the number of cases why like what you say
ya
so I think that is definitely what
they didn't think of lah I guess
ya who be it because the number of cases were like
social worker
oh is it
oh
ya I think that could be something that could be worked on lah
case rising so
definitely that is not being taught
but
okay lah I guess
it is a little bit better now
ya cause I think to be honest if
ya not expecting more definitely
ya
that was so cool ya
I don't know I think it's been a very weird
ya
aiyo but twenty twenty one though like how many more days only
hais
don't know what's gonna happen and
mm
I think
how can nature be a problem
that's
how to collect the water on the leaf
never
okay okay lor if you say so lor
ah
then there is a big issue lah
but I think like
ya but I think environment got not much of an issue it's more of a plus than a minus
ya
but doesn't mean like
but
ya lah but I still think lah confirm under black market so it's not that much lah
for wildlife wildlife got nothing no issue wildlife always win against everything one
really what
mm
ya lah but
in the whole like
natural life pyramid we are at the bottom what
ya no
technically if a lion goes berserk and escape the zoo at it and we dead already what
I don't know I mean like
we are a predator but I guess
if you compare us against the animal kingdom ya the animal kingdom ya
but they have more than that what they have like
ya
ya so definitely we are at the losing end
so our left will win no matter what
meanwhile I should cancel my contribution to world wildlife
yup
ya
ya sure the dolphin can walk using the tail
ya I think no lah I think
then animal go home lor
take the bus lor
no lah I think definitely got a disruption in the ecosystem
but then again where
then like when put it back
wasted
but I think maybe they could just
kill the animal
buy one get one free
I think they kill it leh
ah
no what no no
ya but I think also to be safe they I mean since this
COVID is a new disease also what and that point of time they couldn't identify where was it from or how they
right like it could be a bat or whatever and how can it transferred to humans so definitely that farms closed
monstera
you know there's a monstera adansonii
then the normal monastery the breakages are at the side of the leaves right
ah
you have seen it before what
swiss cheese plant ya
not bad though
can consider
no I'm really taking out together
surviving
it lacks the tough life
anyway I have bought a new plant it's kind of prayer plant
what
should google it up the prayer plant
and err it's an indoor plant
err
not that fussy like monstera so it should be okay lah
technically not really eh it's not like a little sun only cause
indirect sunlight
um
but in awhile monstera are the
lower
eleven okay like for example the forest right you have the big forest you have the tall trees and then you have ferns on top of the trees that kind
ya weeds but monstera usually grow on the lower level ya so you have been blocked by the trees right I appreciate that
ah ah
really meh I thought ferns are like that
it's not hamster
ya
but
yup so the prayer plant is quite good for indoors
it err refreshes the air ah NASA say one
really
ah
ah ah
true lah
trustings
ya
I mean it looks nice
huh
I feel like don't know
this this one don't need sun and when you have your stuff
can
the snake grass plant snake
mothers in laws the tongues
the plant is already very hardy like you can just
put it somewhere and then like ya
the one that my room is quite
ignored nope
still healthy I don't know whether got new shoots I don't I don't even know whether these things can have new shoots or not because
shoots ah shoots
oh
okay lah but I think it's still alive and the prayer plant is something that
you should probably check it out it's quite nice it's like a zebra stripes like that
ya and it's easy to take care so
in the christmas tree plant that you got from me
okay wait ah
the next plant that I wanted to get is actually the hudsonia
actually not bad
and I don't know but I scared like
okay apparently like these plants in an aircon room okay the reason why that monstera is a will thing right is because of my aircon room ya
that is true hor
but anyway
the the prayer plant that I I think the wrapper two three nights in the aircon room
still sturdy and strong um so
what sort of plant got meh
coconut tree but it's not
does it look like a pandan leaf
I guess I know
oh my god my head
I cannot understand
okay sure but then there's also another plant called the cast iron plant
because it's very like
no like apparently like if you
practically put that plant in your cupboard for some time it still survive
a bit different lah the milkshake
ya but anyway it's quite um it's quite a journey
but like the the place where I bought the prayer plant and I saw them um water the plant
like it they pouring into the side lah not from on top dirty fingers cause her bodily so they're like you just poured directly inside better at the water will drain out man
and it's like a lot of water
I'm like wow like that ah
but if you like that means you are also putting the plant at risk what
scotch tap hor it's not plastic wrap
cause I never see my mother already take the whole
so I was quite amazed like oh okay you can actually do that
ya
so I think maybe
I mean definitely for the monstera also
I really hope I can get their items only I I was also thinking to buy the variegated one
the two hundred dollar one
I mean
once I know how to take care lah
once it's the one at home the
the fenestrations fenestrations
ya then maybe I can buy that
but then I don't know where to put
my room is quite small
no one lah not the standard issue plan lah and then like that one at
what is that
I don't understand
hmm
tomorrow I got dinner
it's quite
he wants to eat jinjja chicken
I don't know I haven't ask him where where to go
ya
ya
then twenty fourth you all got the christmas thing going on so that's also another dinner which is probably
err our christmas gathering lor exco base
ya
like cauliflowers
right the cauliflowers
ya I'm gonna do it at scott's house
chill lah whatever lah
I mean not whatever but
at least if it's a
outside location ya true
Q I don't know that's why we need to wait for the food
it's more comfy
I haven't buy present
I got two
okay good
hais
what's the theme
more than thirty
oh I thought usually if not more than
ya that's why really helping the economy good job though
ours is
buy something that starts with S
so I'm going to buy scott but my secret santee is fanny ah charlotte lah
but
I think I want to buy each of them a smaller present just to include everyone so
for scott I went to buy a packet of salt and the glow in the dark stars sticker that one
and I'm going to give him last
then will be like don't so salty here's your present
ya then therefore shanice I'm going to buy
school supplies she's also going back to school
err ya ah
doing comms ah
ya she was a victim so funny like I think she's not even a year at a new place then she quit already
then she was asking me about like the school life and stuff like that then I'm like okay lah not bad lah then sense a different lor different vibe here
ya but she's not that far off lah if you think about her age and the people there
youngest in amongst us

but they got purple
then I can buy Iphone eleven
eh you recently you go right
pool you go there for pool only
mm
yeah
isn't it isn't it how isn't that how it's always been

so like is like the location nice lah

mm
mmhmm

it was so cold in the morning
then then second day is it you all three days you just relax at the hotel
mm
oh
oh okay
ah yeah yeah lah true lah
mm
oh so when you went it's just messy lah is it
ah nothing much
okay
mm
I mean like I I understand that I need to go out like every every week cause if not I feel very like stuck at home
mm
it's nice to go out with your family and staycay lah
what
mm
yeh so one night is you go weekday one night already what five hundred ah no
wah so expensive
oof
try different hotels kan
this staycay in Singapore quite fun lah especially when you go with family or friends
yeah
eh why you never apply for like Coffee Bean
then
then
oh never got reply ah
oo my friend got Coffee Bean then I like uh I hear I hear her pay like I wanna work there too
if you reach a certain amount of hours per week you get ten dollar per hour but I think she might hear wrong lah she might hear wrong what that's why I scared
yeah but okay lah she like becoming one next week like she's taking the health basic health hygiene whatever thing
November oh my god this week got like tick-tock September October you got like nearly two months man
oh very long eh
home bum because you got no work is it
it's not like you're not trying to find what you tried but a lot of jobs like
they never reply or they got different criteria than you expect
kan
mm
yeah they ask a lot of jobs they asking for like for like three years eh err like at least a year experience then I'm like I haven't even start a job then you want a year experience a bit too much sia
yeah
what to do
yeah
is it
is it I never check like jobs right now
mm
yeah that's why
what to do
you got play Among Us
you know there's this game called Among Us
can ask like
yeah
but like it looks so fun right but I cannot lie I can't I I cannot lie everytime I lie they like okay it's Nisha it's Nisha I'm like oh no okay yeah it's me it's me just just kill me already
mm
mm
mm
yeah
mm
mm
what
you can hide the body
wah
I didn't know you can hide the body wah I should I should try
mm
then so many people there right I just kill someone then everyone was like who who would kill someone in front of broad daylight when everyone's here then I just keep quiet
both especially with the plus four plus two
stupid games eh ya
is it all meat or is it just err beef
wah
I mean I know I know you can but you just prefer not to right
yeah but it'd be so random imagine your guy like knows that you don't you don't like beef then one day you just craving for beef
mm mm mm
I was trying to make sense of your sentence then I'm like uh err huh
yeah
mmhmm
that is like no helping buddy like that right no buddy system
mm
they're waiting for you
but you also not interested then they like okay sorry guys next time
then
sometimes I also like that lah but but most of the time when they know then they will change but if they don't know then they don't change and then when they don't when they know you do't go then they stay to the original plan lah
hmm
mm
mm
yeah that's why it's like it's worse I mean would they like it when when I say that oh we eat this one later we we specifically find food for you like like you like left out you know that kind of feeling
then then that's why that's why I keep like distancing from a certain group of people in poly
mm
mm
yeah
eh
four five times as in like to and fro back or what
wah
then next week just take bus all the way later I like I don't really
yeah I'm your guinea pig now ah
and then Natalie idea did you read Natalie's the that thing
I I did the survey but I didn't see the point of having one
I think
I think that will be more useful lah in my cause like they only have disability for what the one that we know so far is a wheelchair only
you never actually heard of other disability kind I think that will be more helpful if they research in that lah
mm
mm
mm
that's why they probaby don't get on the bus they probably take taxi kan
um I mean hmm continue you continue first continue first
no no you finish your sentence first ah
mm
then other than that a lot of people also cannot afford having that kind of help what
cause it is expensive to have a trained dog
uh mm
yeah the yeah
yeah uh huh
mm
mm
yeah like I feel like we should cater our technology more towards the disabled lah
convenience right
mm
yeah cause they had lost one of their senses you know err not one maybe like some it's very sad lah
mm
yeah
have you heard
I mean I I wish we are smart and got money to do this thing
have you heard of the of the of the forest fire in California is it California or Oregon ah
it's constant like even in this in the morning is red colour then like it's so bad this isn't the first time that happen this is the second time that happen cause of a gender reveal thing
exactly like okay lah you want do gender reveal party it's okay I think I think it's a cute idea to have a party like that but if you wanna make an explosion in the middle of like flammable things it's a bit no brainer lah that one
yeah then like can you the the the thing is right the family already have children
then they exposed them to this kind of this this kind of stupidity
yeah lah
really
oh man you should ask cause I think it will damn funny
I didn't know
hmm
oh boy is a girl joke lah
rated

a blessing right
hmm
yeah yeah yeah

Ethelene and Kelly I was so shocked

and then I'm like
but my family said a bit dry but I don't care whether dry or not I care for the frosting the the the the cream cause some I don't really like whipped cream kan

I was really contemplating whether it's okay whether I need a cake then Andrew was like you don't need a cake I was like okay I don't need a cake then I didn't buy a cake
that's why you say you want a cake then I did ask Yin Shen cause like I know Yin Shen felt left out but I asked in the in our our group chat whether anyone would want a cake
then Kelly has been telling me cause even at work I asked her do I need a cake for my birthday then she's like no need lah I just buy for you lah then I'm like don't need lah don't need buy lah don't waste your money cause it's my birthday right she's like nevermind lah nevermind lah I'm like no Kelly you don't need to buy then she baked one cake

aww this one is nice
that's why it's expensive
I press wrongly where do I press
okay
and then I show you the Amara hotel eh

thought that I
err should do right
is I will take two separate room
at least they can spend the night together
there
oh they they have the two bedroom apartment
there price for five adults six one seven okay lah
let's see the photos
Amara
huh got no plate
Maggi
because like how mah want to
shower right
like quite difficult
but two bedroom okay lah ilham can sleep outside
ya
this one oh okay dah I think this is the one that I wanted to take
angah don't like gardens by the bay he went before and he's like
why am I looking at plants
why am I paying to look at plants
okay this one is for three adults right
they can sleep
on the floor lah of course lah with the with the mattress right
but two eight zero and then if I times two it's still cheaper
but we will not be in the same room but I don't mind that lah as long as you know
it's a staycation then I wanted breakfast also then this one also there
got breakfast
included
not bad right
I guess
I were I I'm in that kind of mood

or the another one is this one also Ascott oh the price oh my god
actually the the last time I saw it is about five hundred plus
is a apartment also
mm
oh when are we receiving that ah
ya
because it's every tourist attraction place right
ya ya ya ya I think he will appreciate now at this age
oh ya hor
mm)(mm)(mm
no another one
ya I think he will like adventure cove also
since he like water
ya
I think so I think if it's like once in a while kind of thing I think he will join in it will be awkward lah but I think he
I think he don't mind
no eh ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya I told you I liked it what
are you the one who told me you don't like it
ya
why ah why you don't like it
oh is it
what did you have
a a what
oh
mm okay lah I will decide
oh ya ya ya
mm
I also have it every month
on the itinerary
okay for me
for me the most memorable meal that I ever had is when I went to japan
and I eat that um indian restaurant
because I seriously I I don't think that
a foreign country
will have
will have like
a nice indian food
is like a bit weird lah so when I taste it eh I thought that it's going to be bad but then like oh my god it's so nice
err I ate the prawn green curry you the naan
it's so nice I I I think I still remember the taste until today
ya
no because we uh we
mm it's too loud mm
because we we passed by and then after that we thought eh
then every time eat like either fast food or Maggi or like some japanese noodle
so was like okay lah
and then I don't really like udon
that's why maybe I don't mm
your japanese curry curry also I don't like
ya I just feel like that it's like just like a paste
doesn't taste anything
ya so
err okay lah I mean it's quite expensive
maybe when I convert it into like
singapore dollars like uh
seventeen dollars I think per serving
seventeen dollar tau for a green prawn curry it's not even with rice it's with
naan
okay lah it's worthy it's an experience and then I was like okay wow I I I don't ever have
I didn't even taste like any indian food that taste like that
food ya ya ya ya
no
I didn't
but
mm mm mm
they had it they have it in singapore now right is it
nice
four dollar something
mmhmm)(mm)(mm)(mm
ya
mm
ya
ya ya
ya at first I didn't know but then I had it we had it in bali remember the the Yoshinoya
the yakiniku beef
is it the same thing
ah
but then that one the one that I ate also called yakiniku beef why
oh wait
maybe maybe maybe
oh is it
mm
what do you think for you because I I might take awhile to think about that
I will definitely okay dish is it okay okay I want
ya I wanted to say rice then I was like okay it's not dish
ya it is
is it not I feel like
ya
ya
you choose mee soto
oh okay
ya me too
okay if given a choice
I would probably
for me I think it'll be chicken
ya I think
for the rest of my life
or carbonara
it's either one but I don't know what
probably I want to add one fried egg on top
the runny one
ya
ya I think it's a dish
I think I want to be rihanna for one day
she
ya she's cool
and then she is very like um
independent and then she can do whatever she want
although I know she worked hard for it lah
of course right
it's like
you don't even like maybe need to care about
I don't know taking care of
oh but she's not an actor she's a singer
if celebrity ah rihanna I think I would want to be rihanna for
for for like one day
I wake up and then it's like oh my god oh my god I'm trapped in rihanna's body
then I can like I think and then during that one day that I'm her
I think I just enjoy life
like all the money she have and then probably I'll grab all her beauty lines
I'm her right by the wayi can just like err can I
ya can I just like err take this home home where
ya
and then I will I will like I don't know
I even though I'm scared to take
err helicopter
probably I would for that one day
and then
ya
and then ya
I think it'll be pretty cool to be her
for one day
let's see what kind of life she leads
I think so I think her her house got a lot of you know like those
celebrity house like they stay alone but they got a lot of rooms
I don't know why
like whenever the article came out okay like rihanna room uh house is like seven million
err with twenty four bedroom
ten toilets err attached uh with uh indoor swimming pool
I was like why
who else stay there rihanna I wanted to ask her
okay maybe if I'm her and I can figure out that who else stays there
in that twenty four
probably
ya man
scary siol
I don't think I can
don't ah
will smith
I I hadn't
is it
ugh
mmhmm
and then they put there as a meme
okay oh ya ya ya ya I saw it I saw it like
celebrities like stay home
and then celebrity home is like
that big
ya but like
they have a lot of things to do in their house I don't think they'll be bored they can swim
they can probably play play tennis basketball
and maybe they got like movie like indoor movie ya
and then we we're like okay
buy one get one free
oh you mean like okay okay I don't know
hmm
I don't think any one for one free deal is
a bad thing
unless if I like cannot choose what is my one for one
for example like okay if you go Starbucks you can
but you know sometimes Starbucks got this day that they have one for one but only for certain drinks
ah okay then that kind of deal like okay lah meh I don't want to buy because maybe the drinks I don't want okay lah maybe that one is a bit worse
like huh one for one
but I don't get to choose
but usually one for one is like okay the higher price you pay and then the lower
standard lah
ya ya ya ya
actualy ya I mean
good looks or fit body
what would you prefer
because like the body ah
ha
then can you imagine that you are angry at the person and then like ugh
looking at the face is so more annoying because it's like
the face is already annoying
ya ya ya
face
I think it'll be that I think it'll be a bit hard to reconstruct
ya
ya
and ya like imagine
I don't even wanna say
I like crime documentaries ya bearing channel is the crime investigation channel makeup to me too
ya me too
me too me too
ya even though like uh
okay I like crime and I like law
I think they are two separate things lah maybe some law they just deal with like
whatever
ya like court cases or like how lawyers act in general how they
err
go all out to save their client even though their clients is wrong
you know they like they just
fight for their clients eh no no no uh like he or she is not wrong
and everything like that and then
ah I like like ya I like uh true crime stories
I like like last time I like
like when it
when it shows on channel five
during like I think about nine
after the news nine o'clock news oh I like serious I
ya I mean the whole I I don't know whether they are still
around but I don't think they are um
that
popular anymore
ya I think the older season is better the miami miami
I think it's one of the
I remember that detective the one that doesn't smile I forgot what's his name
ya
and ya I think okay horror right I think it's
something
if the
if the plot case is good
uh or like paranormal activity all these like
um uh cable uh ya
a good movie correct
you know it happens ya ya ya ya
ya
then
err ya ya ya
ya
mm
correct correct
ya
ya I like her also I think I watch almost all her videos already
ya ya ya ya ya the Facebook one I already
watch
ya
what ah
ah chris watts ah is it the chris watts
the one that she the one that the the
ya the one that the guy killed the wife and the kids right
ya ya ya
actually the when the chris watts things happened right
um
I was pregnant it was in two zero one eight
and then the news came out and then I was thinking I was talking
I was
talking to my colleague like
how can uh on earth can anyone do this to their kids and their
and their partner I was like thinking like okay lah maybe
the partner is abusive or maybe like you know there's so many maybe's but then when the story came out I was like
you should watch it
no the movie just recently
two zero one two is when the murder happened
so it's just recently only
ya
Netflix the Netflix one eh
I I think it's badly down because
they didn't show the who story like
I watch the documentary it's like they didn't
like this chris watts
okay he's a narcissist right I think he is a downright narcissist he just didn't know
or he just know but he just
uh I mean he's a narcissist what uh eventually he will just gonna act that oh no it's not my fault you know and things like that
by they in that Netflix documentary I think they did they failed to include a lot of either evidence that was was found like
about two months prior prior to the wedding eh prior to the murder sorry
but you should include all these because it's I mean okay they in that documentary
err the girlfriend lah but
in some sense they didn't say that okay the girlfriend
actually is the
okay the girlfriend actually did some search on on on
on her Google
asking like that that she was searching things that
a bit suspicious lah
and then after that like she know that this guy is
married
with a with a wife that is fifteen weeks pregnant
and then she still you know
ya so I think she's a bit suspicious and
the whole story doesn't add up
but ya you should watch
you should watch soon
if you are given three wishes what would you wish for
what would you wish for
okay
and then
to be honest if I had three wish right I think my wish my first two wish would be
I think I had a few wish when growing up but then it's always the same one
number one is
ya like I never
like I never like um
okay when I started working
okay like I was like pre-teen maybe like eighteen like that right I always thought that okay like
I wish that
I wish
my first wish is that
me and whole family can live in a big house
like a landed house and then
and then
and then money will not be a problem that's my first wish
and then my second wish is always the same
like a big house like not castle lah like
at least it's a landed landed house especially we stay in singapore you know it's very expensive
ya
ya
ya where my parents can actually like uh grow old and they don't need to worry about you know
retirement ya I think that's my wish since ever since I'm I'm I'm I'm quite young
ya then my second wish is okay my second wish is actually the one that
I had after I had
aryan after I had my first baby
which is I wish that
uh healthy okay lah healthy is subjective lah
but I just wish that he will
be smart
and be loyal
to the people that
this
take care of you when you are young kan so I think
ya
in the future he needs to
err they need I have to
do it
for them
ah and then my third wish actually
uh I don't have a third wish until recently
like I just wish that COVID will end
really I think I think COVID is like one of the worst I mean
I was I was still uh I'm already pretty
oh I
err when SARS happened I mean I I'm quite young
we're schooling I think
where are you
I think around I'm in secondary school
err uh um lower secondary
then I think
one of the worst things that happened
like
ya
a job and the they are not even prepared for it
is that like
if a country have like
so many thousands of death in one day like indonesia you can go up to like thousand deaths in one day like
who are this one thousand people like how do they get it
I think at the back of my head kan I will actually really think like then I was like eh like quite sad lah like
they are somebody's
err
father daughter or like kids
and then they just have to die
due to you know
ya
ya and then after that you are at the risk also because maybe you know
so it's quite sad lah
ya
you have any wishes
ya man
ya man
because my my
you think what
that's why why is he even the president
oi

is just to check whether you done your immunisation lor
then you need to be immunised because they are high
likely to be infected if you have any and then with only one kid
you know like things like chicken pox and all this
but

good for me that I've done all the immunisation when I'm young and I already got chicken pox so I no need to take anything

ya it's a child care it's a huge child care and after that
no go inside go inside
teach

there's no malay there's no indian
ya there are more into into international uh so the culture and all is different
I guess or maybe because of the location
orh ya ya ya ya ya ya is at the west coast area there so is
eight thirty to five lah
office hour then after that saturday sunday we are they they are closed
that's the good thing because uh if you go under government
saturday you're uh open half day
then you need to alternate working ah
on saturdays with you colleagues
but this one like saturday sunday you are closed and then what I like is that
the parents
usually they are working from home or they are not working
or they have maids so they will not
like pick up the kids l am bet
or anything no such thing
like they actually come on time and so it's half of the kids so in total
total there will be there is about like forty five kids
and there is like about three lead teacher
so that's why they are actually quite
they they actually need a lot of manpower lah
then we bring them to the playground nearby outside before lunch and then
I get to see uh what they serve for lunch
like some kids is vegetarian so what do they serve some kids is allergic to peanut what do they serve
some kids is lactose intolerant what do they serve ya ya ya it's actually quite interesting
colourful
colourful characters lah like
err and then they
they are very okay
I mean kids will be kids they they are quite naughty but
they will say please most of the time
ya it's quite rare that they will always like can I go to the uh
they call me they call me miss
hu
because they don't my my name is very long right then like uh okay never mind uh just okay just call me miss hu
okay then after that they
oh got one kid say uh miss hu can I go to the toilet please
because I wait for her outside right
then she's done she say
um can I get a wet wipes please
like she's everything is all please like thank you
thank you so much like
very polite but then when when she return to her friends
she's like whoa eh
ya I think she's
ya I think with adults maybe she's trained to be like you know respectful to the adults and and and stuffs like that
and then what's interesting is
go to school on that day right
after they wake up from their nap like twelve
ya
okay sometime they not happy but their mates will take them healthy
so ah
a'ah
the the guardian can only pick them up after one
so at least they got
anytime after one before one cannot
they need to be there they need to go through art class
they have an art class in the morning and then after that they have a language class in the morning as well
no they they change the language every day
ya so if if if this uh one um one
uh no that two kids or one kid in that class speak german
and then we'll go through german
like how do you speak at home like okay can we learn something new from you today
so that day when I was there as a trial teacher
uh one kid is err
ya
half german half japanese so
um
tell us like okay uh
like
okay I will teach you something today like I he is he is actually a very bright person
like ya at home okay before we eat we will say our prayers like that
like it's usually it's it's like uh and then the kids will like orh then they will uh
uh
attempt to attempt to say the language also lah
and then it's very nice and then okay then the most interesting part is
their bath time
if before their shower time right
they okay if they are like
sticky or they like sweaty
the teachers will ask them to shower
but because uh the age five and six they're big enough they can shower their own
but boys and boys lah girls and girls
and then the three and four
ya after like half an hour before that is like usually
like they go we go outside to the to the playground and then we play there for half an hour
and then after that we come back okay we ask them to drink water first
wipe their sweat and then they will shower quick shower they will change
and then after that they will sleep
they know it's their naptime uh they uh then after that they had lunch first then they will sleep
and then the lunch
about one hour
twelve o'clock twelve to one
mm
ya
ya the parents have to make sure that before they come to school they already dah
feed breakfast lah
they have like a snack lah like sandwich or like biscuit with Milo
ya
and then they'll continue whoever that uh doesn't go home
then just continue so like
when I left at one kan
I think
I I left half day but I I stay a bit a bit later lah
to help them I stay until about one forty five two like that
err when I left
actually only left from forty five
only left about twenty kids
ya about twenty kids that the parents bring home or the maid bring back home
ya so it's actually quite it's tiring lah
ya but the funny the fun thing about
being with them is the time pass by very fast
and they are such that like very
curious soul
they like ask me like where are you from why do you want to be a teacher
why are you here today
like can you help me can you help me to peel the apples please
and then when I said why not you peel it yourself
like okay no uh you wash you hands
and you peel it yourself I'll I'll I'll teach you how
okay sure like ya
so there's like oh my god uh and then like there is one three years old still wearing diapers
ya he's shy with me because he never seen me before

so like I was mentioning just now we have to do it
as soon as possible
uh it's like I mentioned just now
you are starting work soon
ah kids also starting school soon
um
when
march eh eh march april
I I think so
because uh now I think the cases in singapore is more or less quite stabilised
and uh we are in phase three
and I think some of the regulation and uh rules like uh have lax a bit lah
so I think they would allow us to do to uh the visiting this year what do you think
ya I think so too probably uh direct relative
and
ya
I don't know the the government haven't
ya issue any notice yet about
celebration
the thing you have been doing uh quite a bit of research these past few days and I've been
reviewing your proposal
so we can can consider some of uh the ideas that
we share in the WhatsApp
WhatsApp group
so I ya I think we should we should err you know
find some I uh
find the to get some quotation
what is err
what is your uh your your ideas for the renovation
uh minimalist
oh I
uh
I think open concept I I I'm okay with the open concept
uh
ah
you are my uh private
cook
ya uh I will buy all the ingredient
and then uh I will I will choose what menu that I want for the day
breakfast lunch dinner
supper
and ya
but you
because because the my appetite is you know
I need to eat at least three to four times a day because
the the the happiness happiness comes from
the wife's cooking
through the stomach
from the mouth through the stomach
ya
I think I'm I'm okay with the bar top counter um
you want a you want to put like a uh you have to hack the wall
and put the the glass
and have a a a a a what you call that a hole
it's like a hole in between so that I can order the food from you right and then when there are visitors
uh the visitor can sit at the bar top counter and chit chat with you while you are cooking and
can entertain the guest
ya because ah ya you are right the
the our kitchen is quite dark so I think if the open concept
more more light can go into the
kitchen
and I think
better lah because more more what you call ventilation
because our kitchen tends to get dirty and mouldy easily
because of the probably poor ventilation
and uh moist
so with the open open concept I think you will have a better ventilation ya
the hole the hole where I get to order the the food lah
ya
and then
ya
uh
to to uh depends on uh
mm
kan ah
mm ya I I think you you think that concept
err I'm I'm okay with that idea
can hack can hack uh uh the what you call that the the wall there
err
and then you uh you you were telling me the other time you want to put the sliding glass
and replace our old windows I think
I think it's a
it's a it's a good idea it's a good idea
oh okay lah
ya lah
you think because uh Facebook and have been
spying spying on your on your your search
so I think
what what you are searching
they they know what you are searching so they are trying to match what you are searching
right
ya ya I think
the uh ya ya can
can can be done can be done
so
mm
made to measure
ya I think I think ya I think the the the windows wear wear and tear over the years
so I think the there's there's a place for them to go in and out
I think the the the insects and lizard likes to come to our house I think cause
we have a lot of food for them
so I think they like to come to our house despite
uh multiple attempt to
uh kill them
they uh they they insist on coming here which I don't understand why
I don't understand because I've been I've been I've been like you know putting all those
uh it uh spraying the the lizard repellents uh spray all over the window all over the house
I've been killing them one by one and I still don't understand why why they keep on coming
I don't I don't I don't understand why
ya I think I I think so too lah the our our house here I think
uh the it's there's a lot of uh lizards
so like they are just now I try to kill one of the baby lizard but I think they are so fast and so
so so resilient ah even though I've tried to to to hit them ah is they as they still manage to
you know run away so resilient and
oh my god so uh I have to kill I have to kill them before they enter to the house
because once they are they they enter the house
very difficult to kill them because they our house got a lot of holes
a lot of places for them to to hide
and then it's so difficult to to kill them and then every night there's like you know like sound like
sometimes even my wife my wife can't sleep in the middle of the night cause of that because of that sound
ya
ah
err
ya
ya
planning to to to have the renovation ya
because it's I think it's about time lah it's about time I think the previous owners
I think they I think we are the I think four
fourth owner third fourth I'm not sure fourth or fifth owners uh I think the previous owners
did not do much
to change the the the the kitchen the fittings
so I think is it's it disintegrates to a point that we
we have to change it not not that not that
we ya it's it's a necessity lah it's a it's a need lah more of a need
necessity because everything has err you know
wears down you know
and uh our our kitchen looks quite dirty and uh rundown and uh
our our the uh you call it the flooring starts to uh wears down
ah ya
ya so I think it's about time that we we we change it
ya but belinda now seem so so so skinny I'm wondering what did what what did she do she is she on like a a diet or cause her her her face is so so small and so rounded
ya because it's so so much difference from the previous episode
the previous episode she was like more plump and
now she's more thinner and
ya I think I think probably she's on like a diet or something like that ya
ya three D innovation because we we watch quite a a lot of
episodes of renovaid
and uh they feature a few uh lah but uh so far three D contractors uh in terms of
the the the outcome ah it it it suits our taste ah
very nice it's very nice as compared to the other
in in some of the episodes ya three D has been consistently
eh very nice lah we like we like the design we like the the the feel of it
ya
ya but uh ya I think we can consider three D
to ask for
quotation
ya actually our kitchen we have replaced the hood we have replaced the stove
we have placed the what you call that uh
not not not the sink ah kitchen tap
quite a few lah and then they even even in our two toilets we change the toilet bowls the sink
ya all all in we spend almost
one a K plus oh one one K is just for
for engaging the contractor to change all this but I think all in plus
all those things that we have replaced probably it adds up to probably two two K two K plus probably ya
so
ya hopefully we don't get the the contractor that we engaged previously who
to finish off the ah
the finish to finish off the the things that
that he have to complete
ya
so
ya
ya
aiya
I don't know lah it's both it is both uh frustrating and funny at the same time eh
we are was quite upset because it's
if the outcome is not
what we we we envision
and then is halfway done
and then err
ya when we try to follow up with him to complete
it seems like he cause he almost got
like probably nine ninety ninety five percent of the whole thing
so at near at the end I think he like
so the last one I think he already he I think he feel the
uh
self guilt lah I think so I don't know lah
ya
cement
oh
plaster
is is is is is very is you should say it's a really bad workmanship lah
ya
ya the was
uh ya it wasn't it wasn't properly installed
in terms of you know they they they overlay the new tiles and then
and then after that they put the but behind the they
I don't know why it's there's like a gaping hole
hollow
and then ya it wasn't supposed to be hollow
was supposed to be a a new tile at the back of the
so when we follow up with him he
I I
I I think he he he he doesn't
rectify the problem
ya
ya I think we ya I think probably it's a cheaper tile
so
and then if it's a cheaper tile then more money will go to him lah probably
ya
then that type of tile also very difficult to clean because it's so rough
difficult to maintain oh ya it's it's none it's not easy to I mean it's not slippery lah but
you want to clean it I think quite
quite difficult ya we should just choose the one that we choose the one that we want
for our tiles
ya
mm ya
ya probably ya we might we might see a few of them and
and then we can compare lah how
about what what's the what they can offer and how much they quote us and then from there we will see how lah
which one we we want to choose
ah
so
mm
ya
major major lah
mm
mm
kan
one uh so one kitchen two toilet
two considered the their package ah
oh
ya
kan might as well kan
so you then that time you buy over eight hundred around thousand
roundest I think thousand four or thousand five around there
do it
mm
mm mm
okay lah thousand five ah eh
so I think ya lah
for I think for long term
for long term I think ya I think we can overlay with it now so when the tile
in uh uh in the future we have uh
overall I I prefer vinyl vinyl vinyl is so far has been
satisfactory for me
ah
ya
send me the one
the one with the sliding and then that that that picture that video also have like a
like got that type of flooring ah
I think that one is vinyl I think that type of concept also is nice ya
back ya
that one the the more expensive one
mm
but have to
you have to ya lah everytime you cook have to clean it up
you know ya
water water water sucking what
absorb what suck water absorb
if we have the the budget can consider lah I think that one's quite expensive is around
wah but I find it like very good leh
and it's wireless
mm
ya I think because after Dyson came out with that thing so a lot of
uh brands uh
uh have that those type of uh two in one type of
vacuum plus mop
but I think that one very good ah uh I think
can can consider lah if we have the means
but now we aiya we see how for now we just use manually first ah
use the sucking mop ah
ya is now is difficult to find the refill
no
uh sometimes they have sometimes they don't have it so
have to have to frequently go there and see if they have stock up
expensive ah
ya that one really nonsense really nonsense
so difficult to find the the the the refill
so ya
but have you we still have to do our due diligence ah because like I told you earlier on
err ya they they get through Renopedia and happens that the the contractor I think halfway
they didn't complete the whole project and
they didn't complete and then ya it's a horror
quite quite quite a a sum of money
they they they lost to the
ya they didn't complete the project so have to be still we have still have to do our due diligence lah
ya
mm
the specific uh ya the specific person who is who is overseeing the the whole thing the
ya
ah ya ya correct correct see ya sometimes even though you are from the same company but different
you know if you get the the one
the bad ones then
even though you might have the bad one and the good ones in the same company so
ya like like you said you have
is the the I the the who is doing the the the thing have to be really
do our due diligence well lah
ya that specific
okay I want okay this person to to oversee the whole thing then
mm
ya I think we we ya as as
as the the the thing progresses then we play we pay incrementally lah ya I don't think we we we
we have we need
pay the whole lump sum
cause we just we might
ya lah like halfway never complete and then money all gone then difficult to get back
get back the money
mm
mm
uh I think this saturday we we settle uh akid's uh school first
cause we need to buy the uniform and
certain things that we have to prepare akid uh school
on feb
so probably after this week I think we can
ya we can start having appointment with them and discuss
uh the the the the renovation ah
mm so actually we K we we need to ya lah we ours we we are the one who should
direct them oh we want this we want this we want this
ya it's a collaboration ah
ya of of of course they have ideas some maybe some of the things they can do some of the things they cannot do
but ah ya we we are the one who should direct
the direction that we want

hey how are you
almost two months ago
kan
you were having your assignment but then I was like complaining to you about something that happened
no
ya
facetime
I don't know I can't remember but it was video call
mmhmm
a'ah seh
ah sia like a blessing in disguise ah eh
okay lah
you heard
but
I was not as in like okay I was not affected for the exercise I was I mean I'm still having my job now lah but um you know because of the lack of manpower then now quite loaded and overwhelmed with all the stuff that needs to be done ah
ya actually I am most of the time only like err two days half days a week then need to go back to the office
ya ya technically yes because
cause there are some like letters from err the government that we need to open up and address them so that's why they need us to you know like physically be there to collect the damn mails and
you know ya
what about you how's school
to sit like for that long hours
back sprain
you know
I just can't pay full attention if I were to do that like on a daily
will drive you nuts actually so at least you know for me if I were to go back office at least half a day at least I get some fresh air otherwise I mean I'm naturally a home
body
but you know it's good to get yourself out at least a short period of time lah
a few hours at least
in a week
ya lah I mean staying at home involve like I mean ideally will be netflix and chill and not like you know sit
in front of your laptop on a chair for long hours
ya that is definitely not ideal
mm
huh as in like what the recording part or like our conversation really
oh my gosh
mm
ya I know you always do lah you always try your best in everything that you do so is your final lap just persevere lah
I mean you made it this far so what's one more year to go right ya
oh
I know
I think that's why they call it comfort food to comfort you otherwise it would have called being called something else if you buy like fruits and vegetables to to make you I don't think that is a comfort food right so hence the name
ya but I feel you ah like I stress eat also most of the time I think I think it's not just us
and when you stay at home right miraculously your weight gain you have massive weight gain also
ya and then like you know right now and at this day and age um
convenience is everywhere so it's if you want to order food it's just one um app away or one call away so
mm
is it I never heard of that before
mmhmm
oh my god that is
are they new on youtube or what
oh
mmhmm
we need to you know just to keep our minds healthy
be mentally you know fit
and physically fit at the same time
uh huh
ya
mmhmm
yes that's the key to be consistent and is very hard to be consistent but once you are you will feel good ah
as cliche as it sounds lah
um healthy eaters simple food so there's less processed
so
ya like I have to at least make time or force myself to to to to to lock down my err to get my workout in ah on a daily
once you get the ball rolling I think it would be okay but you know to start is a bit hard
we just have to
set our mind to it ah
ya
mmhmm
oh is it
mmhmm
what's the average ah what's the ideal
that's normal ah ah
that plays a part ah
ya mm
you know there's a saying you are what you eat really what you consume right it will show on your face your body
mm
ya lah it's never too late I think the pimple will be gone like a few days but you know the irony is that
you have more time you're online learning right but why are you telling me that you are more um you know invested in your in your facial regime then when you are much more busy then you are now
that's right that is just you it's okay we have we we all have that phase
I mean it's not that bad what I mean if you never tell me I wouldn't even notice that you have a pimple on your face sial babe
oh no I'm saying this is because my room is dark and I can't really see your face right now
I've always like you you see even my light is dim and I refused to change it because I like my room to be cosy dark and nice
actually I did once upon a time but I took it out because
okay lah
it looks fine I guess I just want to change things a bit
but I feel like it then I'll put it back on lah
it's like that
ya
oh yes it's right there
you know me too well
how how long have we known each other
primary school yes no no no
is it eh is it K one or nursery eh
err K
there seven
oh
primary five eh
primary five ya
oh my gosh wait primary five
and then now we are like oh my god turning thirty next year so how how how many years
I'm really bad at my math
no we weren't even close
even during school we don't really talk to each other kan
they're they're friends for keeps you know like you click so well
mmhmm
ah
mmhmm
ya
that sounds so wrong
I mean come on everybody's thinking it
I bet the transcriber also will be thinking when you say that right
okay
mm
mm
ah
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
right
I think I know like you
I mean as a friend I I've always known that you are the kind of person who always put others first sometimes to a fault
you know um from what you're telling me
like
the effort
is only at your end
maybe it's not a life and death threatening thing but still it
only a few months it is already draining you and relationships aren't supposed to be like that I know there are hard times lah but
you know like um in someone who does not
do the same when you're facing a problem or issue
ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
wow that really open up like
while you are sharing me this I mean I completely agree you know there are some people
in our lives
okay lah um being in a relationship of friends ah like okay since you are talking about
boys
or guys or men for that matter
there are some
who define us and there's some who you know contributes to our growth over the years
and then there are some who
are not even like
you know
there's this um saying everything happens for a reason and then obviously like err people come and go
and especially when the err when you and when a relationship ends and it's you're part of the
the cause or the reason why it ended
I don't know about men lah but for women we tend to
analyse things
you know I don't know
like it
a relationship will never truly end until the guy or the man says so because for women eh I don't know
we always strive our best to make it work no matter how bad the situation is
so
it's not it's not wrong that you feel that way if you and and and people always say okay um you know
um you shouldn't get back to your err to your ex because you know you broke up for a reason but you know sometimes
it is is is just a matter of where you guys were at that point in time like you guys were so young back then was poly kan err maybe you guys wanted different things then and then now after a few years you already know like how you want your life to be like and is much more easier and
from my no not experience lah but from what I noticed like I do have like my sister and my friends also who got married to their best friend and and
their marriage is much more stronger in that sense ah I'm not saying all but most of the time people who marries their who married their
their best friend
tend to last longer
because
I mean it's your best friend you literally like can be like what you say you can be yourself around that person
and then
there's nothing that holds you back you know like from expressing yourself telling them how you feel or how to act you know in front of them and you know
you you guys were friends before lovers so you know like
the person inside and out
the good and bad
remind me again why you guys broke up ah
mm
mm
aww
aww so cute
a book like a diary
oh right okay
oh my gosh
eh but you know it's a good thing you know like I think
eh that is actually a good thing like um it's like an open communication kind of thing but you know um on paper
mm
then it hit you ah
ya you I mean I know like you you know when a person is looking at you and like um
gazing at you or whatever like you feel it do you do you feel like he's still like attracted to you
as in what online
so you you guys are what contacting now again or what
um
mm
mm
ya
but did you guys end it on a nice note
or was it a bad break up
there was the break up ah then no text after that
until today
then he followed did he follow you back okay
seriously what did you say like what
did you actually say
oh my god
what did he say
were you secretly hoping that you might spark something with him
which didn't work out
I think
it's because you know it ended
on your part
and then you were secretly hoping the what if you know
ya
I mean come on you don't need me to go
down in details of what happened right with your previous exes
mm
ya lah like I said
it it ended on your part so maybe at that point
we just wanted the what if maybe you know like karma as shitty as it sounds so basically you
the the your recent ex was the cause of the break up eh not not the cause of your okay lah somewhat contributed to that right
and then
you got with that guy and then you know the guy that guy played you like cheat you more than three times already so
okay lah I'm just
telling you this
from my perspective
no hard feelings whatever cause I'm a true friend I'll just tell you what is on my mind
so in a way maybe it's a karma for you maybe at that point in time when you were talking to your recent ex he was
he was having such a hard time
to process that
to to to understand that and to actually let you go
so maybe he was
you really you really broke him then
and then I don't blame him if he's putting his guard up because
you mattered so much to him then
and then you broke him and then he he he he's obviously
you know like healed over time and then he don't want the same thing to happen to you again just like how you feel
about your recent ex you know like you don't want the same thing to happen so whatever that you're feeling with your recent ex with that particular girl that he was playing you
with
it's exactly how he feels
about you and your recent ex did you see the bigger picture
ya lah but you can't blame yourself
it's only you know it's only through those experiences that you know you know makes you a better person like you truly appreciate this like you know you you always appreciate the things when they're gone and you tend to reflect on that
aww
wow you would have gotten like a two year old son or daughter by now
eh oh my gosh
I mean
I mean I'm not saying that you should be hopeful
but if it's meant to be it's meant to be there's a reason why your path cross now you know what I mean fate
work in very miraculous ways
honestly eh when it comes to love or when it comes to
matters of the heart
err it doesn't matter whether it's crazy or not because love itself is crazy if you feel like it
it doesn't okay first thing if you want to put yourself out there
I would advise you not to be hopeful
you cannot expect anything because the the the saddest thing about love is
if you love someone
is they are not obligated to love you back
you know what I mean that's the riskiest part
so
if if you ask me go ahead lah it doesn't I mean since you guys are like technically
on err cool right now that you guys are following each other on instagram doesn't hurt to just make the move to ask him out you know just for coffee you know just
you know if it's a if it's if it turns out good you guys you want to respark your and ignite your spark and then okay lah
you know
but err do you know if he's attached now or not
oh my god really
ya it will be weird if the so
I mean bottom line is if you ask me
it doesn't hurt to ask like you know but of course
oh is it
ya I don't give a shit anymore sia I can't even remember
eh isn't this isn't it your birthday this week or isn't it your birthday next week or blah blah blah um let's catch up for let's catch up for coffee you know something like that
so
you know in a way you won't be like if you were to ask him
ya so just make it casual make it like a friendly thing
ya you tend to do that because why you are that respectful which is not which is not a bad thing but you have to know that you know
you you don't want to make it seem as if
you regret what you did
last summer no last summer you regret what you did then so it's more of you like acknowledging what happened then you guys have moved forward and then starting a new chapter as opposed to you regret and doing what you doing now because of what you regretted is two different things

like I still keep in contact with my secondary school friends lah let's see my primary school
my primary school
my primary school friends
my primary school friends err it's like err
they are not
they are not
err in contact with me much because they
they are quite busy with their own lifestyle already then I also not that close now with them

so ya
mm
mm mm no lah
mm mm
ya
I see a'ah
opposite err not really I'm a very dynamic
I have a dynamic taste in music lah okay
I think cause sometimes I like loud music but sometimes also like like like indie also

ya it's like
err emotional ah ya you can express your your feelings lah kan
ya you can express your your feelings lah kan
just
lah
ah service ah
ya
so uh huh
struck an idea that that
ya so uh this is one way lah we can
err bring
bring it up
to them ya so
mm venture
I think
uh about
and
and stuff we are
err more more in depth
for the meantime so
ya I'll just use this opportunity lah kan
mm
ya I can see
err physically so we must monitor them by whatsapp or like ya like to liaise err with my contacts over there lah
uh ya
I think that's mainly what the the difficulties are the rest not so much
ya
ya
no lah I have a few a few friends they are doing it together with me ya
ya
one of them is not is a housewife lah so she she's just doing some side business also then ya so she's also doing this lah then for me and my other friend we are like working full time
ya so ya like ya this is like our part time lah time management so far okay
try to err minimise our workload lah
mm from day to day
ya
but uh I think it's okay lah it's a feasible business I think ah what about you like do you have anything like you want to start up with
or mm
mm
mm oh

uh huh
mm mm ya lah ya lah
ya hopefully lah
hopefully
ya
a'ah
mm ya ya

mm
kan
okay
ya honeymoon mm maybe consider ya
like that but actually err can say I'm more of a sightseeing kind of person lah
ya
I think
mm
ah ya that's way road trip yes
ya so
so
it's it's good lah to bring them
err better I mean
ah
ah okay lah interesting
ya
mm mm ah ya lah
it's it's nice to travel with parents because
ya
so like you like to go travel like so
like what's your favorite season ah mmhmm
mm
mm
I see actually no I mean
err spring is considered err winter right or is it after winter sorry kan ya but I I mean I personally also like winter lah
but err winter like it's very fun lah cause
aesthetically I would prefer err autumn
ya like the beautiful scenery of the autumn leaves like it's it's really nice lah ya
mm ya correct
mmhmm ya ya is like
once the this is all over kan
mm like you really mm
wow
it was it was actually during autumn lah that's when ya I got to experience autumn
ya
they are very err
friendly also and then I I also like every time you go to like seven eleven or any convenience store they always greet you one without fail ya so that's one thing I like admire lah about them
then so ya singapore err ya correct
ya basic courtesy obviously manners ya ya lah but I guess japanese people are just born or they are taught that way lah right
since young so
that's why
ah then orh
there's the bullet train lah ya the high speed train all
no I only took the high speed train only
because because I couldn't afford the no lah I feel that I I because the destination I'm going doesn't require me to take the high the bullet train lah it's just the high speed train which
like normal lah I I mean it's quite fast when you're inside it it's quite fast I think travelling about three hundred plus kilometer per hour ya
but you already like when you're inside you don't really feel anything
ya like ya
which is not bad good ya but
like you said it's quite expensive it's uh the food
really
mm ya sure can I can bring you like there ya I mean there's I mean I've not been to all the places what so I also like keen to go visit all the other places
in japan
ya so it's it's good lah
I think it'll be a good experience right
ya so
wah all this conversation about travelling makes me want to
err miss I really miss travelling lah like err mm ya ya ya mmhmm mmhmm ya
ya
mm
but
ya
err
wait wait what is this is this like interview no lah but I mean like interview but no lah I mean like ya ya

afraid of insect orh
mm ah
mm
ya understand but but it's amazing that you can still take the aeroplane right you don't think too much lah mm
mm mm ya lah I see
ya I think can say fifty fifty lah
ya but if you ask me to take like a cable car or like the the flyer or anything roller coaster I'm not that afraid lah ya
okay ah
mm
mm mm
ya I get it oh
ya ya I get it I I I know luge ya uh huh the singapore ya ya

I can say insects also ah I I quite afraid of no ah I don't like bees or or flying things around me ya flying things and then I also don't I'm quite afraid of spiders
ya I mean it's nice to look at but I don't dare to touch it lah
that kind of thing
ya plus I ever got this experience at malaysia ah or somewhere ah no no no a spider quite a big spider like almost the size of my palm ya then
it was actually on the sink ah then I didn't know that it was a spider then I was just like doing my own things then I wanted to wash my hair or something then I thought that that thing is like a decoration or what lah no I almost touched it lah then I press the tap then suddenly the thing start to move
then I freak out
ya no lah of course not then then the thing just started to move out no no no
the the spider just like went all over the house
and then like we I was
kind of jumping out
and then uh
like
I asked for help lah
it's so big
so big lah
mm
mm
ya I see
I mean err
there's a lot of err
things lah that
like insects that bothers me cause
ya I'm can say we also lucky that we're not in australia
right with all those funny funny insects all now you you don't know what
ya
and then I mean okay okay maybe maybe I can pick up the antenna ah
I don't know what is it called lah just pick it up and like throw ya ya but if it's too small then I will have to use a tissue lah I wouldn't dare to pick it up by my bare hands cause got this err how to say
the squishiness or crunchiness of the the the skin lah it's disgusting right eat ah eat you mean like like ah oh
no no no I
funny story err no no I didn't I sort of tried lah but not really insect but it's at thailand no cause okay there's this err you know at
chiang mai or something ah
but actually it's a supermarket ah then they sell snacks and then I happen to saw they have this snacks
err I think is it worm or don't know what err something lah
is it like a cocoon ah or something ya so
it was like that lah
then I was like curious lah then my friend also like psycho me to try lah try
then we go and buy so we buy and then I tried once and
the the I think you can imagine like meal worm if you know remember
last time what is meal worms that white colour worm
I don't know lah ya that it it it tasted
it smells like that lah ya smells like that ya
but I I I took one bite and then I I cannot
ya I can I cannot
I cannot err take it lah ya it was uh
mm mm mm ya eww
is it prawn no
ya I mean from the look of it also I can hear when they bite on it it's like so crunchy like
err you know but the worst thing okay lah insect is fine I mean not fine but rats is out of the picture but scorpion for example I how do you even eat that
mm mm I know
ya you probably get stomach flu
mm staple food lah
orh
ya ya ya
this interesting interesting and disgusting but ya
mm yes
to speak more err err fluently mm you also don't get
to ask me much questions ya ya
ya mm sure sure
ya so like
mm
I don't know like err
like I see that
you have the latest iphone lah no lah what phone is that ah orh orh expensive
ya I know apple and their expensive products
mm ya actually okay lah I mean like err it's easy to use but camera wise ya there are some issues some some setbacks the back camera back camera ah ya the back camera lah
because like certain err photos I take like the lens ah I don't know why it's not wide or something then it will like zoom in
ya I think I'm not so sure about the others though but I didn't have this problem with my other phones ah my samsung and sony I use to use I use to use a sony phone
ah I like that so much ya use to be it use to be about music then now they change to camera lah ya
they have quite good
camera lens
on their phone ya so ya not bad
but ya but
samsung is like already way way ahead so that's why I
kind err drop
like jump ship lah samsung ah ya ya ya ya ya ya but I don't know is for me it looks it feels weird
or it's just me but it's it's it's it's like weird because
err the middle part is like split ya and then when you open it up it becomes like one big tablet or something right
then uh I don't I also don't really like tablet as a phone or
things like that lah ya okay lah
ya
but I see iphone twelve already but I heard what iphone twelve don't have charger lah
mm ya
the cable lah
ya ya you know I think what they use micro or something right ya ya
ya so it's been a great time ya

okay um
you know I was wondering right
would you rather good looks or a fit body because I see like everybody
everybody especially now because we got like coming up soon
everybody are like they want to train and what not
I never really got a difference between having good looks and a fit body so personally which one will you
prefer
are good looking then
you lucky ah
cause you because
you will get you will
you can train you can exercise and you can get there
you get what I mean
so to me it's like I would I would prefer good looks
just because
um
okay lah err I mean
make sense oh going off of that
err
because you were saying like oh live a long live long life and stuff like that right
then
I was just thinking about it like the other day
then like
err
you know how the emphasis is all about the environment there right so it's like there were some like um
note notes lah about err extinction and all that stuff
then I was wondering how would you how do you think that humans will eventually become extinct
we we will go extinct the question is how and when
that that that last point that you made
you know I err
you know the game plague
the one where like you spread the virus and stuff
how easy it was to like spread a virus in the world
um
the the the
we're so interconnected lah it's it's to the point where
we are moving around too much
not to say is bad because it's just
at the same time it's like too much of a good thing isn't good lah
that kind of thing
so
like if you think about it
there are like a lot of viruses in
africa
but
if and when the day comes that people end up a lot more people end up um
then
partly because they are used to it
they are used to like this kind of thing so genetically and also government wise they know how to handle it
but then the rest of us we live in like relatively cleaner relatively more like virus free places
ya so I feel like that would be the one way that we would all be extinct
you know that that
in my in my opinion ah
err too many wants not enough resources
like we want too many things lah but
if let's say we have
like like the population goes down to a more to a lower rate I feel like that would be better for us and also for the earth
you get what I mean
we will be like eh
food and water and all that stuff so now we can
build back up and all that
that's in my opinion ah I don't know
but ya
but to be fair I feel like humans are quite resilient it will be a bit hard for us to go extinct
okay but then
err
enough with that deep stuff
ah this one is
realistic kind supernatural no supernatural later that one is superpower no no
realistic realistic
that's what I mean
any kind of skill lah like any life skill don't need to be specific to soccer or anything
okay
I feel like
second skill is basically about managing stress right
that that's the best way to put it right
then your first one would be
confidence
confidence in public speaking
then your last one is
err let me go by one to three err first one is confident speaking
second one is managing stress
third one is um
the hardest of all the three
okay let me give you mine first mine would be
first one would definitely be managing stress like that one in this world
ya
exam school
just general life stress and all that
if you cannot handle it then you're done for lah especially if since you play sports you know
it's like the anxiety before some people get
personally right
I know people who get like adrenaline
err
very pumped up very excited
but to me is like
it's it's a bit more challenging because
you go for competition then you are nervous and then
you are worried you start thinking about all the different scenarios and all that stuff
and
like
so there's no there's no really any need there's not really any need lah to be very nervous and all that stuff
so that would be that one skill that I would want that ability to
manage the stress manage the anxiety like before an important thing or anything lah that kind cause to me in general day to day life I feel like I'm okay
like I'm not very stressful over everything
but when I feel like I've worked some people gain confidence because they know that they work very very hard for something right but then to me it's more it's more like the more I work for something
the more I feel nervous because
like I put in so much effort already I put in so much time
and then if I mess up now is like wah all that time wasted all that effort gone
you know
so
ya
that's that's that's that one that's that one skill that I would want
and then number two would be
wah actually
I mean if if okay
one one skill would be probably
ya lah I will the the second skill I will relate it to my running
like
I mean naturally lah I would want to be running I would want to like have that ability to run like all those top runners and all that stuff like ya
that's that's the one that I can think of because
um
the the better you get at something
the more confidence you have in yourself
so the more secure you are about who you are like okay
no matter what fails like no matter how bad I am at something I know at at the very least okay this is something that I'm solid at
it's like our safe place ah like it not only does it take our mind off work but it also builds our confidence in that aspect
then you are like okay I need to go and like do something else but let's say if you are if you are if you want to do something else but you are also not very good at that something
I would like to be good at some like very very good at something because
I feel that it would help me
in my own self confidence
in that sense ya so number one was err stress management number two would be to be very good at
err running
then number three I feel would be
um
don't be so direct
like like I shouldn't be very direct because sometimes
I just feel like
aiya
don't bother lah just say it just say it even though like the situation may not be right for it
but I just say what I think
and
all humans got flaws right
so
the thing is
especially older people they don't like it when you point out their flaws
I'm not the kind that will like tell indirectly to somebody then that somebody tell the somebody I will just tell you straight and a lot of people don't like that
ya so those are like my three skills that I would like
ya ya
okay one more oh yes
anything like anything in the world
you know
you wish for it and it comes that kind
mm okay that's true
anything
uh
hmm
stocks
okay for me right
I feel like the one thing I would want free of charge
would probably be food
and if you can have all the money in the world right
if I had all the money in the world I would feel like I don't need to work
so sudden all of a sudden you have like all this free time and then they are like wah I don't know what to do with it
so in my opinion right
if I were to have one thing that was free it would probably be food
not money or like or like the ability to buy stocks because
like
ya if you had you had if you had all the food in the world
if you could get any single food in the world
you can one of course you can feed yourself you can feed your family but
in a larger like extent
you can
which is I feel would grant me a sense of purpose lah
in that sense
so it would really
ya
so
that's for me
then err
mm oh ya just now you mentioned something about superpower
remember when I ask you the skill
so let's get let's get to that question if you had if you could have any just one but any single superpower what would you have
what would you want it to be
I feel like
you know
that's something that I feel so
I wouldn't I wouldn't put that as a superpower because I feel like machines can make that happen
but to me one superpower that I would have would probably be to
would probably be
the ability to
you know how batman is you you read comics
you know how batman is like known as the greatest detective
because of his ability to like
read situations read people and all that stuff
and like look for things and all that
that would be my that would be the one superpower that I want
that kind of like intellect that kind of ability
that kind of smarts that would be the one and that kind of ruthlessness also
then that will be like the kind of superpower that I would want I I can't really find a word for it lah but
ya
because with that you can you basically can control everything
ya you would be the one person who know you will know your your
your opponent's moves before they even do it
which is like quite cool lah in my opinion
ya ya
oh building on that
then what superpower what super since you watch comics what super
hero or supervillain would you want to be
just one
I read both lah so
can be any
I mean you know mine lah mine would probably be batman lah
he achieves what he wants to achieve
and but he also has certain morals that he doesn't
ya
so like in my opinion if you are talking about still being able to stay human
it will probably be batman
because then you don't you you yes you have to face the expectations like
err comic comic batman
is that
err
in my opinion it will be batman lah
ya ya mm
they are labelled as
he can be very like aloof
he can very he can be very like distant when he wants to be or he can be very controlling when he wants to be
put on you
I mean oh so basically it is that concept of with great ya lah like you said lah with great power comes great responsibility in a sense lah I mean in this sense it'll be
the higher the the higher you go in a certain thing the more expectations people like people expect you to be a certain way people expect you to like look a certain way do a certain way and all that stuff lah that's essentially what you saying
okay I mean
that's true
that's very true all of us all of us
okay very true
okay personally I feel like
I mean the most common one for me is
school lah like they they
everybody just has this idea that
like
I'm
a very fit I guess same as you
except that it is a
I I run and in the school like I I'm considered to be like the the one of the better ones lah
and I feel like
that's
that's not very accurate
and
somehow also place expectations on yourself like okay
I have to sort of live up to the expectation
ya lah
so it's like outside pressure but also you on the inside telling yourself
okay I need to make sure like I I look a certain way I do a certain way I
train properly and all that stuff
but
or like how come your muscles not as defined that kind then you are like ah
okay I need to I need to go back and I need to work harder that kind
so in a way it can be bad
but if
you you you
if you don't
if you take it in a different light
you feel
ya
that's for me personally
I don't know
I I
ya mm
mm
what would your ideal day in life be
what would your ideal day in life be
given that you get your dream occupation and all that stuff
I mean okay
the difference is like like in terms of
you want to help like people and all that stuff right
then
like
training people
err
it gives me the most joy
so it I don't really think of it as coaching or a job I just think of it as
something that I like to do
like if you are talking about ideal day
coaching
then
while I'm coaching I can also be training
you get so it's like
then I can like go and run with like my my students and all that stuff lah we can run together we can talk we can bond and all that stuff
it feels like
to me I don't know about other people lah but to me
I'm I as a student would be more motivated
or I as like an athlete will be more motivated if I see like my coach is also doing it you know like eh setting by example if coach can do it I also can do it I should be able to do it that kind you know so I feel like
ya
but ya
is is is
it's fun lah
okay I mean
okay okay the one part that you said that I felt was important is that you are doing it for like the enjoyment of it lah you are not doing it for the competitive aspect of it
ya that's that's
something that I feel
it's something that I would never do
I will always
like
like like the reason why I will want to continue training is to compete lah that kind
you know
like maybe because like genetics and stuff I've never really had any problem with keeping with staying healthy
but at the same time
I understand lah that some people don't have that part
ya so I get where you're coming from

mm just rerun of friends and big bang theory
mm not yet why is it good what is it about
sounds like a good show leh
maybe I give it a shot
what else do you think about often black
okay thanks
I see about that
okay ah thanks
uh by the way uh what do you think I should prepare now while waiting for a full time job
okay I guess I'll prepared that where do I find this kind of sample
okay sure then if I prepare interview outfit what do I need to wear blazer and tie
okay
maybe I'll try find
thanks but
ya lah hopefully something will turn up lah after the after all the application
o
okay lah okay I take note oh ya by the way then that time uh besides from orphan black that time I saw you watching one show at netflix uh what were you watching
ppls what's that about
like orange is the new black
is is it a show
money heist next season coming up by the way season five
like what
oh ya kingdom the zombie korean series
really
interesting
maybe later I see uh who are the actors
not particular but I know some of them
wouldn't say favourite but I think it's not bad but overall it's overrated
I mean this is just my opinion I think that is the most overrated uh hot shit on netflix people are comparing this to breaking bad like seriously
idea like the idea of the heist is pretty good I will give them but the few episode were quite intriguing and that's what got me hooked but it went downhill after few episodes the writing is just I don't know lazy the character development was good but for a few episodes after that it's just like filler afterwards
every character in the show is absolutely stupid even the professor right why would you tell angel where your hangar is
like that was absolutely unnecessary and could have made their operation like better and smoother
in fact every action by the professor was quite
silly why go to the scrap yard and risks being seen by potential witness then could have sent the serbs to burn the car for you why even go talk to the inspector at the cafe in the first place that's just asking for trouble and raquel finally puts everything together because she saw a brown strand of hair on the professor suit like really like so many other red flags and the brown strand of hair was what gave him away like really like among all the things like that was the most easiest clue
I mean this is just lazy writing to me but seriously the drama and shit if all the hostages that could have been solved if they offered everyone one million euros from
them to go in return for cooperating but then the cop security guards also locked up in the basement they could just let them go in the beginning
they could've saved oslo and avoided the explosion but everything is just so messy like the only hostage that elevated was the ambassador's daughter anyway I mean this show is overrated and stupid I can see why people compare it to breaking bad they have such bad taste but why need professional critics to the judge of what movie show are good or not I mean ya that's my that's just my ah two cents of it
I mean it ended already right or is it still on
I didn't think about it didn't cross my mind but
usually where should I buy I mean if it's a good chop chop sale like which platform is worth seeing like shopee lazada or
okay maybe I check that out ah but are you buying anything
eh
oh serious ah are you buying
oh ya then uh alesya belated birthday celebration are you getting her anything
first hand
where you going to find it
huh but azam isn't he too young to ride already
how much is it
okay lah if you buying make sure you check everything first before you purchase ah
then like that
if you gave him the you going to get him into joined to competition or what oh
actually I've been thinking about it but I'm not too sure should I further my studies
really but
but then now times are hard what if I don't get get those kind of job
I will think about it lah I mean it's not that cheap it's not expensive but right now I barely will have full time job but
what you say is quite true lah degree is important I'll think about it lah
but then I don't know asking my friends they say some of them
just uh rather just take degree then find a job but nowadays degree uh sorry degree holders that just graduate also cannot fine job so I don't think there's a difference between diploma holders and degree
I mean right now times are really bad so actually quite impossible to get
a permanent full time job to me ya
ya like less than ten
and majority of them are just doing full time then only a minority are doing like part time degree while working full time and some of them only one or two because of they are in the uniform group there are in uh in there they get the bond and stuff like that
ya I mean like for example my friend work at rolls royce they get sponsored lah
like ya first at first paid for his diploma then after his long term contracts and stuff like that he wanted to further studies then because of his good conduct and everything they
able to land him a degree also they willing to pay for your degree then he continue his bond with the company ah I mean
uh usually been there for at least five years ya his salary bomb went up a lot but I mean considering he uh when he joined the company he only got higher NITEC then after that when you join he continue with the bond then they continue his studies with uh a part time diploma then he manage to get then he keep increasing so at the same time also his position also went up not too high but above average
uh he is under maintenance side and technician uh if I'm not wrong uh under the engine side
building and you know testing and stuff like that from what I know lah
as much as I would but my diploma isn't under engineering mine is under so it's quite off I mean considering most of them
I'm not too sure if they need any specialist or whatever because
the company is quite well known so I'm sure in a way they got
you know like sources to who to hire as ever that I mean considering himself
already sit at the company quite long so I think the people there are quite you know long term service I think
but I don't know lah I mean
another friend of mine he signed on as uh prison warden ya uh he he is he sign on for I think five years five or ten years the bond then
uh the benefits you get a house nearby his workplace uh at just besides changi prison so
in a way beneficial for him lah don't need to stress about you know buying bidding and stuff like that so everything's in place ah for him
if I'm not wrong ah
oh uh he was my classmate in poly so we both we both have diploma ya he's a guy
ya and if I'm not wrong last I saw him he he rank up again
if I'm not wrong ya but what I heard is that
they can you know they can rent uh not sure if they can rent the place or what because I heard some they uh they do some investment meaning they stay at the quarters but then they buy flats but then uh they rent out so it's either they rent out their quarters or they rented the they they bought if I'm not wrong lah
ya if I'm not if if I'm not wrong five or ten years ah that one I'm not too sure but I think he is sticking to diploma only we call
ya it seems like it I mean it depends I guess cause even now like you know the brand decathlon ya my friend she works there then uh she told me about the benefit uh when she just join full time they even uh give you uh benefits like continuing your studies to pay for it and stuff like that ya even uh
another friend of mine uh she works at adventure if I'm not wrong it's in charge of those you know rock climbing activities at the new khatib home ya she told me about it
they also provide err you to you know encourage you to further your studies but
if you have only higher NITEC then you ask you to they will encourage you and it depends on your conduct lah but and all ya
err adventure no no it's is it's not brand it's more of like a company in-charge of uh fitness and wellness something like that like you know the new ya it's not retail ya ya she is going to continue next year ya because she just join the company eh not degree diploma sorry if I'm not wrong she told me that err
the company will pay until she finish her studies ya but then it's not like a bond but it's something like a bond that means she have to stay under the company until you get a diploma something like that if I'm not wrong in a way I mean it's not that I don't want but ya it's the end of year so it's quite hard for me to get a job
ya I mean it's end of the year so hardly companies are hiring usually they hire like you know the starting of the year so ya ya I'm not
okay I mean ya lah just help me out if I need
fourth december he
uh fourth december ha
ya he replied after you you told me you you send to him already I already texted him saying that I send my resume and he replied saying that he will get back to me by next week so ya that's by via whatsapp
ya
uh she told me err what she experienced before is that sometimes it takes a while for them to get back ya because uh she worked under that company when she was intern and also when she graduated oh she also she also has degree by the way
uh chemical chemical science meaning I think err
quite in that
in terms of chemistry ya uh right now she's just like me waiting for but ya she still searching for you but the only cons is that
the only downfall about her is that she graduated earlier this year so it's been quite a while lah ya ya because she was look she wants to work in the lab but then most of them offer her like jurong island that kind of thing that share more of like
uh exposed to outside chemicals she rather do lab testing and stuff like that but then right now I think it's quite strict for them to hire new people because of COVID and stuff
she graduated from if I'm not wrong
ya
okay lah anyway
my bike what what you mean
mm my plan is I send the cover set to spray to change to be the only colour in singapore and after that
ah that one I settled already so next is to
to not say overhaul my engine but
in a way to they call it up spec meaning to make it faster so right now it's still under testing it's already done by there's some a bit of loose ends to need to figure out what's the problem and stuff
ya in a in a way
ya both actually
ya in a way he told me to test drive first then at the same time
uh tested but then haven't tested like full on the road like really try to get top speed and stuff like that
ya I plan to use it I hope to get everything done before end of december because I really want to use that bike
and the same time to use it on new year's countdown don't know if there will be a new year's countdown also
no like to see fireworks and stuff but at the same time able to take photo with my bike and with the fireworks at the background but don't even know if there's a
fireworks so
I'm not too sure I I wasn't looking forward to it because when I research online it was not much an option so at same time
with the strictness of COVID going on and stuff so pretty much and I've seen some people who went for staycation oh my god the the queue I can't even take it I can't even I can't even be patient when queueing up to enter the mall doing the safe entry what else with me going to staycation I think I'll go bonkers with it
for more than four hours
ya the breakfast they waited so long and they have to queue outside the hotel so you tell me you you think I will want to wait
I saw it on tiktok
someone someone did like a review like
you know is this hotel worth it but then ya so they showed majority of it is at the bad side of it because there's so much people they check in from two it became
up to four so
the queue is like
just to check it itself is really people queuing until outside of the hotel already so that's how bad it is I can't remember I forgot if I'm not wrong was it concord
or something like that
his job is basically ah what I know is related to his course so for him he has the upper hand mine is more on network and routers and everything like coding programming everything it's basically like how you're using your phone right now ah ya I do that kind of job behind the scene
in depth about it
I think should be contract staff ya very beneficial
um maybe lah I guess see how
I mean first choice would be
second then third maybe I want to try back my old intern company ya
I'm not too sure but I can maybe ask the cause I still have her contact so maybe I can ask her about it ya ya I think should be the same lah but I'm not too sure if the company is still going on or not because they're they're small uh company so
but might not know if there still lasting that long or not because they are just basically sub com so ya okay then
something to do with like
parking and stuff like that like she's the overview like the eye of it behind all the cameras something like not really I wouldn't want to sit behind a computer for like eight hours and stuff
ya I guess I mean for now might as well just take whatever that's open up for me lah
oh ya I I wouldn't mind my all my friend work just behind our house and his says just like five minutes away from us ya I mean
uh engineer but ya lah I mean wouldn't uh wouldn't know if the company needs or what but from the look of it for his side under engineer
his working schedule is quite okay there's work life balance there he starts work at six forty five ends at two forty five ya so basically technically you got the whole day to yourself in the end
considering him working there he told me that he can everyday can
uh if you want to you can so ya when I heard he
it's just another few more hours so okay what
I'm not too sure considering she's quite picky and she always like to take her brother and sister toy so
ya but I don't know I mean if want to talk about clothes her mother always buy for her lots and lots of clothes I myself also don't know what else to get her
okay
mmhmm
oh ya by the way that your bike
what you gonna do with it are you gonna change the cover set or are you just gonna leave it like that
X one R
huh I thought it's under your name
uh there are demo too young because
oh
ha chain
chain adjust
oh
alamak
oh that time he ask me err he he asked me that uh how much I earned when I do foodpanda and grab and stuff like that
because he he scheduled somehow
so I told him like roughly lah how much I earn then he was shocked I earn sometimes I earned as uh much more than his monthly but I told him lah
I told him ah that time I I hit about uh four thousand plus
and he said he was shocked ah my pay
was higher than him then tell him lah but I work until I want to die like that
then
I told him lah the difference between delivery and permanent full time is that we chase for the money
people always think doing delivery easy but it's not necessary so like ya I was telling him the pros and cons some of the venue are very slow then have to you know the weather in singapore is always unpredictable sometime it rains sometimes it's hot sometimes it's both
I told him lah to think to think twice but I told him it's okay to do for part time for side income but I tell him lah
with his back
she used for it's okay for you to use to to go back and forth for from work
if you want to use for delivery
I'm not too sure lah because he's riding a scrambler so you know with back delivery and staff in the height of the bike
you know and ya at the same time scrambler the pick up is very strong so I'm afraid if he and those like soup or anything might spill or what
you know
then I told him lah
up to twenty one dollars when I do delivery because like you know per order is less than one hour so
and I told him ah I it's not everyday is sunday so he has to be patient with it lah
ya I'm also confused because
before he rides
extra four hundred which is owned by our dad he already ride so he sold it off then after that our dad pity him and give him one of his bike
but then now he suddenly want to buy his own bike so I'm quite confused
err
then he was he was shocked lah I say no lah because he didn't thought he would do you would do that kind of job I mean I'm I'm I'm shocked lah he he he judge but whatever lah I mean
I mean you just want to try try only what then and then I told him lah
like it's all up to individual lah I mean all
I I tell him what all your three younger siblings all got do delivery only you never do
too many people order online so
ya was it some bubble tea shop
uh I told him uh
when the video but they can remember your face if people take it closely to your face lah
uh was that even though it's raining and stuff now roo
roo is is so good because they give without hesitation they know it's been raining they add more additional money like you know per docket uh add another three dollars or four dollars ya they add another extra surcharge for you know for riders so to me it's reasonable lah because
while they ride in the rain
they know that is worth it because the amount they the amount they add on is
oh okay lah maybe I see about that
but okay lah I mean I wouldn't complain already lah I mean as long as the market is good already lah because panda right now sometimes the system cock up they send from one end to another end and then the docket they say
uh now uh based on distance but the distance still crap and the docket is still crack so I don't get what panda is doing a lot of people are complaining but at they same time
we ya but it's not that we have a choice because even if complain also and of this after that to change the the price
ya because I saw that time when I sent to hougang mall
plain clothes the act like they are but actually they are just grab enforcers I don't get
why and while my one of my friend who is a good girl who do grab for fun then I uh she she ride but she put under but err bicycle ya she did same like you but
I told her lah ah they there's cons doing that because if you get catched and stuff like that yesterday that you might get banned and stuff then she said you tell me lah what's the logic behind this grab enforcers oh I mean I'm working what but at the same time it doesn't make sense because you catch me you ban me from work but then you never tell me that
when I was applying for it like at the and stuff so
it's like to me it's like you in a way you con people you know like just not wearing a shirt
you can get banned and at the same time if
you are not using the bag you can get somehow like demerit points or something like that so to her she say lah like
oh is it like that time came up on strait times the the one fourteen year old fifteen kid call using grab app saying
but that's unfair what I mean you already delivered until you take from the shop and then they complain so grab is basically customer service friendly and not rider friendly ah wah that sucks
okay I'll take note lah

start okay okay so
okay start from the
so he stuck at lookout for suspicious character lah
but why can't she the be so why can't she be clear
okay
so new sia
ah uh
mm
mm
mmhmm
clear about what he's getting
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
okay
mm because we haven't even consented to this relationship in the first place
cough up lah information
mm
mm
go into that yes
ya
okay
ya which you you might not but you might not agree ah
ah ah mmhmm
ya ya lah but I guess baby steps then after that
did you did you specifically say that
ya mm
hmm
ah
mm
a'ah seh
okay so
oh so just the informal ya
ah
ah
mm
you said
mm
mm
ah
okay
dayah's ah ah
mm mm
so fed up ah this type of thing
I don't think he even thinks like this lah
oh
foresight a'ah
did you say that did you say
what do you expect that's the very doesn't this tell us so much about why
then your life like and then you can just trail along do you really expect that and do you think it's that way really
don't confuse don't conflict the two you know
are you sure or not salim I don't think so these two people only get to know each other two years I know you more than two years we've only gotten serious for two years and I know you even before that yet even then
you still there's so much for us to discover
haiya
I mean I haiya I don't know what to feel about this
ya
send ya
must take this action
I know continuing from what I I was saying just now I'm I'm thankful and okay good that he's a nice guy
but I don't know I don't know whether uh I
pushed or zina will be pulled down
err big personality how to say not big lah firm firm firm personality you get what I'm saying right
ya
your life will turn out well
ah
step out step up and out of it and then when this particular point comes
I wouldn't know how it'll she'll be addressed
I want to wish her well but at the same time I I just feel like I also don't know where this type of relationship dynamics will lead into it can be quite worrying
talk to dayah
eye to eye
what what do you talk about personal things with izat
huh you talk about marriage to izat like what
this was before lah
seriously
so it's okay what no it's not deeply personal I think I think you are getting this wrong
ya but zina can also ask you the same then why and why you and izat is always at loggerheads
no but I think you between you and you and izat are still pretty estranged isn't it
ya lah
ya lah because also also dayah always clamps her down
that's why I don't think she can see that way
so what's your plan
ya lah
ya ya
hidayah is clamping her down lah
ya ya
huh
ah ah ah where
you said that okay
okay
you said that ah then
ya
it's very hard and you will often require a certain mm
change of life events or certain

K and K got that
you can put your earpiece back on
so anyway um how has your work been
oh oh okay okay okay
how long was it eh the practicum
huh so fast
mm
oh ya okay ya ya ya no no err what was I
suddenly
mm
oh
oh
oh no
oh
mm
mm
mm ya that that's why
ya
ya oh so
they offered you full time is it
mmhmm
oh
oh
mm
that's good that's refreshing
mm
mm
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh ya ya ya ya ya that's mm awkward
mm
mm
go and at least resolve it internally
ya ya that's why
mm
wait that that that's a good thing kan or
mm
mm
ya
oh okay
or people with experience lah so they don't have to train so much
independent
mm
I see
ya
mm LOL
ya
ya that's true
oh that's a lot
that's why siao
mm
ya
I mean you mean in a single point at a single point in time you need to have like a hundred cases
like at at any point in time
oh so not like say this month I have ten next month I have another ten that's crazy hundred case how do you keep track
oh
ya
what I hear from a lot of my social worker friends
so you're not gonna take take up their
mm
mm
oh okay
ya
mm
ah okay okay
ah
I mean I got exam but I don't think that is comparable
am I am I talking too loud like do you do you feel like I'm talking very loud
no right
the phone the mic
ya see when I laugh it kind of
jumps up a bit so like oh no sorry whoever's transcribing I'm so sorry okay
that's where I'm at I mean that's not where I'm at I'm kind of past that but ya totally understand
ya
mm make sense ya make sense I mean you also still
mm
considering a different industry I mean at this point like my previous job was doing what I liked
but like it was
mm dream job kind of like like it had all the characteristics of what I wanted to do like child psychology in uh you know in a clinic setting in a clinical setting and everything and then I got to like
you know do creative things do research still and like do projects and stuff but at the end of the day like it was a horrible time
mm it's been good I am teaching
eventually when I'm no longer a trainee I will we will alternate like one will be lead one will be co-lead so the lead will be the one going through the activity and then after the activity is done
um switch lah so then the other the co-lead will be the lead so the co-lead basically what we do is we just look at everyone make sure nobody's like sleeping or like playing with the virtual background or like
there was a kid last week who kept pressing the clapping and the raise hand button and I was like oh my god
doing that thank you kind of thing and it doesn't come naturally to me lah cause I I I have a habit of being like can you can you um err I need I'll be like err oh sit down okay or like err
I need you to be quiet okay or like can you be can you be a little quiet actually I'm I'm like okay I can that one they they want me to like not say that okay be more firm because otherwise you know they are they are they are in the comfort of their own home so they feel like they can do whatever they want lah
ya and these are young kids like from kindergarten age to like primary school age so
ya it could be a little bit
practice
ya
mm be strict first
ya that actually makes sense that's what my mum said also
make sure they are muted got question unmute must mute chat disable then sometimes when you ask for answers for them to type the answer in
you know my period's coming
tau like I'm just tired not enough sleep so I just continued but then it continued to
I'm not coming and then turns out that nobody came uh okay lah like out of the six of us only like four people eh two people came ya so that were only like three people including the coach
mm
uh yes but in that case do you want to go with me I'm going on monday
I think like there's
there's
I'm hoping that aiya I can go
did she reply me nope not yet
with whatever hurts or what the issue is
mm
ah okay
oh
I see okay good that I
don't then
mm
oh then hers is how much
mm
mm
ya cause I was thinking if I went to see my sports doctor like the doctor that I was seeing when I was playing rugby kan
movement she she she's legit like the the one to go to but she's
ya just a lot
ya that's why I'm thinking
so doesn't really need like a doctor
you know I mean I can still move it's not like a herniated disc or anything like that
ya
ya so she also like told me to just
ten ten ten ten ten ten but twenty times
ya so it's like an endurance thing it lasted like forty five minutes it was horrible
mm
oh that is so
oh my god
I cannot imagine I cannot imagine and then like
you know
it's just like ugh gross
way lower than you thought
oh
mm and doesn't like fluctuate too much like like you won't go like super high mm
ya ya ya
ya
the first time I heard my voice as in I feel like I sound like a preadolescent boy I kind of feel like I sound like a boy when I listen to it by myself my god I sound like a ten year old boy or something uh
cringe
ya I feel like I sound like a kid I think inhan sounds not like older than me I feel
I don't know I feel like I sound like a kid I don't I don't sound like like a girl I don't sound like a like a lady or a woman I just sound like a like a like a boy
wider range of
that's true that's true imagine if we start singing you know right now you know
it is raining right now is any super heavily actually near my house
oh mine like stopped just now and now it's started again
ya how does my voice sound like to you like does it is it do you think it's low or high or medium or does does it sound like a boy
just sounds like me lah I mean like you heard you heard my okay okay
mm
yup yup
it's like from the we are like listening to our voice from the inside I feel I think something like that lah it's something like that so rather than but but
but but like say you you are listening to my voice as it passes through like
the air like not kan so it's a different ya so
I mean if maybe if we're on the moon we would sound different like so if we were on the moon and we
took off our our astronaut gear and we started talking we'll probably sound different ya but those few moments before we die if we have conversation we probably would sound completely different
no
chris evans oh chris evans I thought cause love love space or elon whatever his name is elon musk
err ya ya he wants to capitalise off another yet another thing
I wonder if we can talk about these politics I mean it's not all politics I mean it's not even politics it's just ugh celebrity
I guess
is it mm I had no idea I thought his late dad left him like buttloads of money
where shall we where shall we go on tuesday
which which interest you the most I feel like the train track ones is cute but then I'm just a bit scary looks a bit scary
mm
oh
mm ang mo kio park
so this one is easy cause it's just walking
mm ya and then there's
dairy farm nature park
and this one quite
oh eco green
like would it be very is it a park or is it like a a hiking trail like an actual hiking trail
I know afiqah afiqah you know she take some nice she goes to some areas you know
eh were you staying at our table
mm
she got married uh I if I'm not wrong she got married at quite um because like err
I guess circuit breaker kind of disrupted her plans a little bit and I don't think they wanted they want to shift the date too much so I think the period that she got married in right
um they only allow like ten people
mm and then she had to wear like a face shield but she bejeweled it lah like with her
like with her veil and stuff it was really cute
that she was she's always
talking about
mm I don't think so
oh is the is the one that her long term the one that always eh ya the one that's always been with her I've I think ya and he's really he's really nice really nice so I think
I was talking about someone else
I don't know but ya
mm
okay maybe I just don't remember but ya
mm
think he's just shy but he's very like supportive of her and everything I think that's really good
nope
think he's younger than her
ya
um
I'm not sure I think her place
I think because like when I see her her pictures and stuff she seems to be at home so I think
mm makes more sense
oh
I don't know like he goes out to work anyway so he's not
I mean unless they are both working ah then maybe
I don't know I don't know what I'm saying but ya
what would I know
mm
oh like the dad is more chill lah usually
and also like it's a culture thing also lah like oh you some mother-in-laws are not happy if you are working you know they'll expect you to be
ya especially in this day and age and in in living in singapore and stuff
mm
ya
ya ya
ya I ya
that's true also that's true
ya ya ya ya it's like a double it's like a you expect you say that and on the other hand ya
ya then when when he's at school or she's at school then it makes it you know slightly you have more time lah to like uh you know when when he's at school we're at work so your kid won't be like left alone and like someone has to take care of him or her
ya that's true

okay recorded okay
so what was what was it that you wanted to talk about
oh was it with his girlfriend also
serious oh is it because of his surprise birthday party uh
so what have you decided
eh how do you get her number ah I know you message her on right
then she gave her gave you her number
wah your friend is so going to feel betrayed sia
ya don't ever do that bro no no no no my friends should not contact without me
so dah decide
so what's your plan plan A plan B plan C plan D
orh
but you think he okay or not
serious ah
I don't know I I don't like it when people give me surprise and don't tell me
I don't know I just compartmentalise everything or if there's such a word to begin with ya ya ya that's what happens that's what happens for my life okay so what's your plan B
Pezzo pizza lah
mm
oh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya cable car and
or go
Madame Tussauds that one is it
Tussauds Tussauds whatever lah
oh
okay
oh forty two dollars for two tickets
and you pay forty two
oh that's good deal man
eh can you share the link with me
mm
I wonder if they just sell satay
but expensive price
alah
oh okay okay okay then the weather won't be so bad
oh and fly kite
oh
can you please buy a good kite
I don't know
oh but you need to find a good spot man I feel that day
but I felt because the
I think there are places which I see right people went right that had not shelter lah that had shade
ya ya ya so that's why I'm saying like
what time you intend to go ah that's the point
mm
actually that day
mm
you want to do a surprise you have to
make it blow the pants off like that like you know fuh
okay actually to me lah is the person the person who bring the surprise person right is very important
like Razi did very well for me I mean I cannot forget that
yes and you must really go with the flow of the story
actually right there is a possibility on the actual day he also don't want to go to either one of these places ah then what happen ah
oh he will ah okay okay um because if you have people like me very difficult you have to keep on changing plans
how long have they been together
oh okay so there was another birthday that
no because if they are used to you know
gone
but ya that's very nice lah of the girlfriend
mm
no I thought if you got car then you go Marina Barrage
Marina Bay uh Marina Marina Bay lah kan
Barrage if you got no car you go Sentosa
oh because no no no no so regardless of where you go before that you still wanna go satay by the bay lah
oh okay then Marina Barrage makes sense lah
yes yes yes
mm
ya but do you wanna do you wanna jeopardise the surprise just so that you can have meriahness if there is
I mean aiya for me as long as you can actually get him to go out already is is good enough and not pick any sign nothing
no no suspicion no no
ya ya actually it's true lah I I mean no I personally don't like Sentosa
no you wait wait wait you like the activity for Sentosa
earlier lah
oh it's a weekend ah
ah
okay
oh ya I forgotten okay
cable car is one of them if I'm not wrong cable car
orh
actually I've never gone to the wax museum before lah in Singapore
with you once with my girlfriend once but I don't know which country was it
ah okay
ah
I'm pretty sure if he's
what to do what time to go out
of course of course he makes his own decision
the birthday boy is gonna be from
Tampines
not the other side of the Singapore right
ah
ah okay
wait where she stay again
near my house
ah near my friend's place okay okay okay
come on the shopping mall is next to you like I remember going to Orchard you know from one building to another and we actually take car
oh my god
anyway motor is convenient ah
but I think
oh really
so early ah it's indoor what
oh you mm okay lah I mean
get a one slice cake
that one is very
okay lah
because the time is going to be wasted there
I don't know I
uh I mean you are just the person who is just gonna follow lah huh
the final say
no she's going to be the one going through the shit
I don't know how I'm gonna surprise people lah so I always leave it to other people
oh ya yeah
I have come to the age that I
cannot be bothered to do it
ya ya ya
when you reach there yes
you'll be like okay it's just another birthday
you like ah
no but seriously if your end your endgame is satay by the bay for dinner then Marina Barrage is better ah
food
okay all growing boys
ya but to me mm okay lah for occasions I think the place is okay
do they not know you yet
oh okay okay okay because she don't know you yet
mm then what she say
oh my god
uh then what did you tell her
ya ya ya ya
not just satay a lot of things that you don't eat
uh mee tom yum mm one of them
no because now
ah
I won't enjoy it so
you don't eat a lot of thing even that kind of thing you just don't eat
the you are going on a weekend right
satay by the bay might be quite packed you know
and you can't make reservation that's the problem it's not about the fact that it's packed it's the fact that you can't make reservations
okay you have to go with the flow if if for whatever reason lah eh let's say
um
yes
ya you can't be bothered not like you're gonna eat much anyway
but
which you will probably be bringing because if you are after our lesson of going to Marina Barrage that day I
regret not bring water bottle
yeah I didn't bring water bottle that time what
and still not enough
I think once we
yeah and you need to have wet weather programme ah
oh it's very sudden
like what
you guys are his world too
yeah
yeah so it's nice that as a girlfriend she put in effort to do that
for what
are you serious
ya lah
so that you can focus on your work ah
you don't have any other friends meh
you have right
yeah
oh you got further subset of your
mm
I know I know you know I know I know already lah
a'ah
but they don't
okay the subsets don't overlap ah
ya lah
orh
okay okay I know I know
and the same person I don't like too okay
wah I should make friends with this friend of yours lah
ah ya lah
no but I think he's like that because he sees what she do also lah
hypocrite he feels I think this is the long hair guy right that you don't like right ya ya ya
if I don't like you ah it will show on my face so you better don't see my face
yeah
it's okay lah no loss to him
yeah
yeah
so is no to him is no loss lah so that's why he's like that
do you do they know that you meet each other
oh they know ah so
ah okay
yeah and I know why you don't wanna go
yeah
oh confirm ah
it's confirmed
mm
did they did somebody you directly
alamak

yeah you told me that
mm
now
it's okay
it's okay
orh
orh
you told me right is that the one
right the indian muslim one and the that one right ya
okay lah
hmm hmm
I don't know I don't I don't miss in any way
ya I definitely won't be one of them
oh Marissa Shu you never go before ah
I think if you go with Shu also it'll be fun
you enjoy or you don't enjoy
oh
ya lah
so you like ya I mean
it makes it less
how to say ah
oh but I don't like odd numbers I normally don't like odd numbers
so I have a group of friends that is only the three of us only and
sometimes it can be quite
quite quite unpleasant lah but okay lah I mean
it can be quite unpleasant at times but if you are very very close and there's no reason why two should be and one alone
then is okay
mm
but they make you feel included lah
I don't know
anyway I don't have a lot of big groups already
now I only have what okay so
my friends is only that Shiqah Ad Razi group
Tasha Cecillia
who else do I go out with I mean Aidil they all but I rarely get to meet him lah but I still consider him as someone I'm close
ya that's all my friends sia oh and my colleagues
my current colleague my ex-colleague
my ex-ex-colleague
ah
but I think two person is much more better leh I feel lah
don't know lah I'm just antisocial in that way
I am
aiya but they going week weekend ah
actually now now is not a good time to go already in my opinion
you passed the free and easy period already now start to pick up already
I don't know how you can recognise such faces seh
but there are so many foreigners in Singapore
ah no no no no it's because you bought a pass there
and you during that time when you had the pass you went like almost every other month or so
yeah
is it at the end of your poly
no third year
I don't know I would never pay for
you give me free ticket I can
for me no
are you serious you took the galactica before
why the blue one more scary ah
try ah
cannot ah
because at the end of the day I go to to take photo
that one nice and to eat
the churros there very nice
and that that was
I remember going there the first time when I was not like
I went there share I went with who ah I went with my husband is it
back then boyfriend I think
no but that wasn't the first time
ya but the ride I took was quite safe right
it's like kids
early part eh
and that was probably the end of my first trimester
oh crazy man that's like a dangerous period you know
so you have to be very careful
anyway but it's okay what
I mean I
I mean no the the ride was so I think even if you put kids in there also they won't be scared sia
their there's no speed
because I didn't take most of the ride
the same ride
what tell her my sister was pregnant and she took it
then nothing
can you give your bank account to art also
that's money coming in okay
yes
she normally send using her official address
Mindy's right
yeah
how
what
oh my god okay
oh
I no no no nobody had a pick up line like that to me
then then then
oh so it worked
it's a funny but then then then so she plan then they started talking also it worked ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya but your friend look so
opinion
ya ya ya ya and he don't give a shit if you
you don't like it means you don't like it if I want to say it I say it
yeah
because if he doesn't hide
ah he will say
a bit meh
young blood
but I like this kind of people
we always have this one friend who
who makes us proud for he who he or she is
mine would be Aidil lah up till now
actually actually is true eh
and then his mum will be left
aww
my friend told me you have to you have to engage your son
make sure you have that relationship with him
he's not afraid so that he will willingly
like nature first nature you know to to
to share with your mum this kind of nonsense
ya ya ya
but not for me
oh I don't tell her so that uh she's not worried that's the point
like because
do you see I was quiet when I was younger
do you think I mind my own business when I was younger
then I talk to who ah
ah I think I talk to my friend more
ya actually I was I was rebelling man
but come on okay that's what happen when you have age gap like thirteen years apart okay
our life don't cross
yeah
do you know that secondary school is the start of your like
you bloom into somebody okay
path you wanna take ah I feel
I took the nerd path
ya
but I'm always from school I don't even hang out with my friends
I remember
Kartini will walk there and I walk here and then we will meet there you know
from far I can see if she arrive first she's holding onto a paper
and then I will be holding on to my own paper
then if we are both reading for our test paper
ya and then
wait and then ah whether is it or whether is it secondary school it's the same
we always run to the main gate because the side gate got closed
so once we see the moment we reaching the side gate right and we see the teacher closing all of us will start running
and then
no I think the teacher know our face too too many a times already lah this one
then uh I remember lah the one in my secondary school is this
um very strict indian discipline guy you know
we were like
I'm your always the one standing at the back of the class
because we can't make it to the front part of the class
yeah
and then
oh ya we we I tell you we are nerds what we can spend in library from nine eh nine in the morning until nine at night
no ten in the morning until nine at night
um was I like that for secondary school
I don't think so eh
no I'm busy for but I think on weekends when I have no
weekends when I have
yeah that's why nobody see me
yeah
no every week I study okay wait this the thing about me okay
people people try to what they call it ah
crash study crash
crash lah they try to crash everything into their mind after that ya that's I was thinking
yeah
uh so so for me I cannot so every week I actually have a revision for myself
we will go for lunch break
and then go back to library study
and then after that you take a tea break
at five O'clock tea break or dinner and then after that the best part is
yeah consistency cause I cannot take stress
I cannot take stress
when I found out that last minute I had test right in primary school did I tell you
I called her because they got surprise test
yeah
so it was during I can't remember which level ah in primary school and then the funny thing is
I found out that later on after the uh after our recess got test right then I call
my mum ask uh hello then I say
then I keep quiet then my mum hello
I didn't study that's the part I'm super stressed
I cannot take surprises
ya I cannot
I
oh
surprise
cannot lah sia I will be stressed
okay lah
that's
yeah I only learn that at my later part of my age ah
I realised I
eh don't tell this to Farid ah cause
he will laugh his pants off if he hears his mum is such a
yeah yeah yeah it must be like after after school days lah
after
if not he will use it against me
you know I don't like it when people use it against me
ya man I remember you normally
oh my god
A for commitment
but apparently it wasn't A for your final results
ya ya ya
if only they grade effort ah
drill
bit
ah ya
oh shit
are you serious
switch
hospital
ya that I know even though I didn't do O level I took O level I take I took sec two O okay
shaved plastic shave
yes
oh my gosh
this one laughed
oh ya actually it's true ah a drill is quite safe ah
you ask her it it kiap the thing right it's supposed to be
ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya I know I know I know
I did my in sec two
I did something it was something I can bring back but of course I threw it away already I guess
wah that's a nice phone is that Ada's phone
no no I think it's Samsung
ya so I was a geek lah we concluded and then recess time is copying homework
not those everyday
everyday so you make sure that the homework that is for subjects before
ya ya that's why I say you cannot let him know my
we have a place in the school that we copy homework
it's called the hut
okay and then we rotate homework
secondary school
we rotate homework so on the table is circle right then people sit all around
then it's like okay uh
oh in the morning when you come then you ask each other eh
geography lah geography maths science okay
we sit according to how we want to copy the homework
no cause I got no time to do
I can tell you since sec one I told you already what I'm in band one
it's not only certain days almost every day I got
then upper sec I was a debater huh
so
debater is even worse I remember the day that I had
final debate and then
so my my debate and my band
band competition is just a few days apart and this is all like national level ah
so and I remember my my conductor told me do not let the result of your debate affect your performance in the final
ah
ah because I think I had a solo part in that in that
then I said no no no it won't
of course I I lost but we got second so it's still not so bad
uh yeah
I remember after the competition I went straight to the band room
after school I had the competition after competition I went to the band room to go and practice
so yeah
my life and then I still do dance performances in school
oh sports that's the one thing so in all aspects if you talk about like
uh arts uh sports and
uh I don't know geek lah I would categorise uh debate as geek lah I mean
geek being a geek is in my blood lah it's just that I'm a cool I'm a cool geek okay I'm not those
I'm not those library geek lah okay I'm not a library officer
I'm not those like who join library and all that
I
I'm quite cool lah debater oh I even join maths club for some competition
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
my secondary school to go to for one of the course
why eh I did very well in it you know
do you know there's this game um minefield
eh that one is I tell you ah
I didn't know how good I mean
school is just school I always feel that school is
it's not a true test of how a person is actually good in their particular subject lah
if you are really good in science you see all your nature around you one shot you can catch oh
like how curious a a kid is oh why is the ball bouncing
how does why does the ball bounce
and everytime it bounce it gets lower and lower that means the bouncing's gap is getting lower and lower
ya you need that kind of brain then those are the people who are good at science
I go for the oh so I went for this maths maths I don't know what they called it
but ya I I oh the only reason why I went for that course was because ah ah ya this geek
we are the people who's always late for school
uh who err so
we like I say we are like the cool kid we always come to school late uh we join dances and all and dance dance competition and all that but
the day the one day that we ran from the side gate to the main gate we couldn't make it
I think the the head prefect really effed up lah basically
he must be waking up from the wrong side of the bed or something like that
he he he the the whole prefect blocked the entrance
ah
eh come on lah I mean
then anyway so we
then the pledge right so we have to stand up all the prefect face the front and took pledge we will all behind the prefect
and then my friend was like
before the prefect turn we were already running out of the school
he hor we sit at the staircase and wait
after that one of the girl say eh you know ah
actually the head prefect saw my face already ah just now and she is those okay what you call like
truant girl who is in the smart class this girl ah
she's the one who's always in the bad company but she's also in the top second top class lah
eh so and so so and so saw my face already know wah if he see that I disappear already ah sure he will mark me one
and you know what we did
stupid we ran quite far
I think like at least five blocks away cross the road
we actually walked back to school lah sia
we walked to school it was like I think the second last day or the third last day before school closed for the year
walao eh this one is gonna spoil my reputation in school I mean I might be the one who copy homework and everything but there's nothing on record okay
then
ya ya ya so my name officially I had to go for detention lah
but as we were walking in the school the maths club people went out
and then they say that one of the
one of the person who is actually
who is actually uh supposed to go for the
who's supposed to go for the math's club decided that he's going to take for the day
and then it's like
then they say we need a replacement
I volunteer myself lah
so in the end
my first and last detention
I didn't have to go because I represented the school for the maths thing
and what what was initially a bad
situation where I had to be under detention
they wiped off my
record of detention
because I actually represented the school for
no lah of course it's nothing but you know I like full attendance I like no detention records
oh
a'ah
what the heck
did the rest run also
are you serious
oh my god
oh but the discipline master doesn't know you personally ah
ya your your class is very the good
is it just
then but your class is the only one who had a history record of how many teacher run walking out
so pai kia ah
all cannot make it sia
ah
huh
eh actually primary school classes are the worst to manage ah
you know what my friend say she say half of the primary school they
you know it's very random you know like you'll be talking about let's say maths ah okay
one plus one is equal to two then suddenly the kid will be quiet and then like you will ask why why why are you quiet
my uncle just passed away
the student
a few years ago
and then I was like no ya
they are like that one especially primary one
if you teach primary one class right you have to be mentally ready they see spirits
ya
so that why I you you teach primary school
you you you have to be capable of managing
but it's fun lah they are innocent ah so at least no vulgarities or at least most of them no vulgarities
I I prefer secondary school
off can ah if ya

don't you think so like with COVID like
it was january february march COVID
november december
um I think I wanted to go to new zealand
ya new zealand ah most
fully because it was in a tour
and then I think what was I I I felt what was most memorable probably was
there are shared memories together ah
oh berry van eh
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more with the one in australia compared to ya
so I wanted to bungee but my aunties were all making a big fuss out of it
and ya lah so but the irony was amidst all the commotion
there my back then lah my uncle who was fifty plus suddenly out of the whole tour group I think he was one of the eldest or one of the oldest
yes
and he was the only one in the group
ya um and the group had
I think youngsters me included and few others
yup
so he was the only one brave enough
ah despite my aunts' protestations
and ya lah so he jump ah he was the only one who jump smiling
I mean the usual health
declarations apply lah kan you got there
and once you are done ya lah I mean it is an accomplishment right it is an achievement
ya
actually for new zealand um
the year that I went
can't remember whether one or two nights but I remembered that
the night before
this thing that happened
I was watching the netherlands match ah so
we were supposed to travel somewhere else
err
eh did I say two thousand sixteen no not two thousand sixteen sorry sorry sorry it was two thousand and six
sorry sorry it was two thousand and six not two thousand and sixteen two thousand and six
ah was that the first time I felt snow
err
but it was the first time experiencing snow so fun lah
is that
the malls closed at five so you imagine eh
ya
K lah how chocolate is the best lah
or coffee but I think back then I wasn't much of a coffee drinker
ah apple spice that was the melbourne winter winter festival
woo shiok ah
wilsons promontory
dapat
I'm sure they are adapt
at finding their own food ah kan
ya the the experience I think I think if you will for example to take a tour
will bring you to the more
high level touristy places
err
ya
um you can park up at any place that you want by the beach by by a park
you can sleep over
you can even
um you can even decide on the spot that hey I want to spend two did two night here instead of only one
ya you can get to enjoy and sightsee
I just gonna shoot straight for
flight tickets are gonna be expensive
wanna drive all the way um
what they do is they drive
to penang
and then and then you're just crossing into thailand border oh you see
so to me
then the other alternative is fly to
krabi or fly to phuket
ya
ya
true but then I felt that okay lah I think after the first
after the first camper van trip sorry after the first time we took the camper van on the ocean liner
and then
I think that was just the experience lah of trying to see how you drive onto
the ship lah kan
cabin cabin
ya
it wasn't that bad
no lah I guess when it got
it was still relatively calm
and then by the time we got ourselves ready and prep to go to sleep
ya when the storm or whatever rough seasons pass then
it's all calm lah
ah
oh ya
ya I think supermarkets overseas ah
um there are
other things that they have as well
the selection is bigger there's more variety
true
because they are the producers ah that's why
ah meat so fresh
we tend to cook more by ourselves than over here
true
even the ice cream is different
okay
because you have a variety to choose from ah
much more predictable in that sense
and then you got your pepperberries your lemons there is no unique flavor you know like for example lychee rose for example
quite common
suitable to
okay
farmer's market
mm ya
and the best donuts in the world
eh do you notice
it could be ya
we ordered the the bombolinis lah the donuts right
I think that was the first time ever that we tried that kind of donut that stuffed donut
kind of
um
and
alright then
their
flavours the filling
unique um overflowing
so they were oozing out and okay lah I guess it's it just added to the whole experience
and break your head has boosted their donuts as the best donuts in the world lah
any other stuffed donut which comes close to that
ya
ya ya
ya oh and then when we went to camden market we managed to try that peruvian street food
that was interesting
plantains eh
did they grill that one grill kan
I think it was grilled and then they put um brown sugar or something on top right
ya if I'm not mistaken it was that ah
ya that one
eh there was something that I thought about um oh oh oh oh oh oh um london um
the devil brownies ah
ya that was a random find ah no we went to that
that weekend market
um I wouldn't say it's a random find lah because we purposefully wanted to go to that market
but the brownies we didn't expect it to be there
ah correct
where aspiring business owners visit this there err these dragons or pitch their ideas to these dragons ah so these dragons are
um so ya she pitch her brownies to them ah
I think I saw that as part of her marketing collateral
err she used that as part of her advertisement lah
ah but I really good are really really good
do you miss the food
do you miss singapore food when you are overseas
ya
ah noodle oodle um that's just
soup ah
so
probably
okay but I know definitely for certain
I miss
the
I miss the paskintani fried chicken
but it's different because this this chicken that they make
K imagine nandos ah so the taste is
slightly okay on par or even nicer than nandos
but the price
ah the price the price is way cheaper than nandos ah
because it's like it's food meant for for the man on the street
it's like fast food you know
but this pakistani fried chicken or whatever the fried chicken that they sell
it's meant for a quick grab ah
and that's nice I miss that cause it's cheap and it's good
ah yes
eh the pie is nice
ya
ya it wasn't shepherd's pie but it was very nice
ya
what was their name ah a pie thing is it
pie face or pie thing
ya but it was nice ah
ya what else ah
what else was nice that we have
oh buffet that that buffet was power
eh that was a nice chance upon ah
that was not in our initial plan lah because our initial plan was
was to do the north coast for five hundred that north
north coast route of scotland
but because of the accident we had to turn back
and then when we turn back
um ya some changes to our plans
ya
okay lah it's a saving grace lah
it's a saving grace because I think
um those ya that jacket potato was nice
ya it was milkshake and skittles ah
filling in the jacket potato
ya I think it was sour cream
ya
and we didn't eat I mean I didn't of course we didn't eat meat over there so we chose
we always chose a vegetarian option ya or pescatarian lah at least oh that was some nice jacket potato
ya
that's true
kan
ya cheaper lah ya but I don't understand how people could
spend thousands err on prada
understand ah it's still thousands eh
B I C E S T E R bicester
yes
somewhere near the south
because you girls wanted to shop
at the outlet factory ya
okay lah
so far none so far the three of our major trips
we have there are this this three major lah the and the two australia
ah
oh
err
slide down the slope ya
best ah
fifty
mm
oh
ya
the beaches err jog my memory again where did we go
oh sydney ya bondi
I think we did
portsmouth
ya I agree
malaysia nature
okay lah I mean
the thing about
the thing about nature in malaysia
um
oh oh ya ya ya
ah
but it's hot ah
that's true
that's why we should always travel to
temperate climate
four season four season climate
I've been to spain
ya I have err
two thousand let me recall ah when did I go to spain
two thousand
ya this was uni two thousand seven
seven I think or two thousand eight
I met my friend who was doing his exchange in netherlands
and then from netherlands sort of like
a trip before he gets back to singapore
um we went to travel around the areas lah so we went to spain um
specifically we went to madrid lah
so err I clearly remember there was one night
I think it was spain versus italy
mm ya
um I think you really have to plan
public the bus which brought us with from country to country you you just took the bus so it could be a long ride
so I remember there was one um
so when we reach belgium
um we thought that the bus station uh at that belgium to the airport was quite near lah
only for us to realise that actually
and then and then we were basically poor students today
and then we were
the cab fare was more than one hundred and twenty euros
definitely ah
I think the bus was even free to bring you to the airport
ya so we got the wrong airport
we wanted ya we were supposed to catch our flight to porto portuguese not porto portuguese porto portugal
and then we thought that wherever that bus station in belgium was in relation to the supposed airport is near
but apparently the budget terminal was further further further away
um
ya
ya so timing we still had I mean like
we still had about at an hour lah but sixty kilometres away ya kan so it's still quite a distance
forty five minutes to get there ah
this was the start lah almost the start I think ya
so we negotiated lah we said we are students we missed our bus
the taxi driver said okay I tell you what
nevermind ah he just so happened that he was also a muslim
and then he said okay nevermind
belgium belgium ya okay so he said okay nevermind err I charge you
I forgot a hundred or one hundred and twenty euros lah basically
ya so he switched on his meter
regulation kan
and then by the time we reach there he
uh maybe three quarters ah
so he accepted the whatever money that that we got lah and we managed to catch our flight just in time
before the gate closed lah maybe we had like half an hour before the gate close
ya and that was just the start of our journey ah
run into I
I think the I won't say highlight lah but one of the more memorable thing was
partying in the streets for two hours after spain won against italy
ya and uh I mean when you're in a festive mood
the spaniards were quite nice to you lah
ya and then I think when when
where we watch I think it was like their
you know sometimes certain cities have that have like their central
central area or you know central parade square or something like that
I think it was something similar to that at madrid lah ah but from where they were
from where we were going back to our hostel
err I think
by by their train it would have taken us about
let me think ah
maybe about half an hour or sorts
ya but on that day
ah so dah happy happy
ya that was that was an
ya
oh I remember there was one there was one instance I think it was
I think this was in madrid
no
ya
so
no
it's like it's soaked
soaked with sugar so one each ah
so we were thinking of as I think if it was any other shopkeeper
he probably just asked like six enjoyed and charged us a full price
and basically being dishonest about it ah
ya
power ah
ya that's why
ya
ya
then we realized that all the shops were closed because they were all sleeping
ah like they really took their break
yes yes
ya
ya
ah yup
true
who came up to us
say assamualaikum and started to err to talk to us in malay
so we talk to him when quite further in he said oh actually yes he's bangladeshi
for
working ah so he was working in malaysia for quite a number of years then I guess he
came back to bangladesh and then um you know went back went to spain to work lah
ya working overseas is something
okay lah not a lifelong dream but
it is something that I want to at least try once in my life
sometimes only we working overseas then you know whether you will like it or not
ya
the closest I had for staying was
I had six months ah of exchange in canada
that was a I wouldn't say there's even that even came close ah but
yes
totally
ya or at least the community which I was in made me feel welcome ah to the point that I felt that hey
this isn't too bad a place if you want to stay here
ya
both ah
okay so um when when I was at the university at mcgill in montreal
um the or the muslim students association they were quite
um vibrant and there are very active lah
so um I decided that okay let's make the best out of my exchange experience and let's join them lah
because when I were went there also um
it coincided with the fasting month
ya fasting oversea I think that was one of the best experience because fasting hours was short ah

mm
orh
oh Jetstar
okay
orh
ah
okay okay
and then we've also been to perth
three times already in
the whole of
last year and I think probably
mm
mm
mm
mm okay so because kan you are the type of
mm
mm
like all my house mates like how to cook and surprisingly
all of them knew how to cook lah so it was very easy
and they taught me how to cook rice taught me how to cook a lot of things lah so I felt like
I didn't know what fish I was supposed to cook with
so I just bought salmon lah then I wanted to cook salmon curry but then
uh
so it was a bit weird lah ya
I know right oh my gosh ya
enjoying my sleep lah
then after that leh
the car outside kan
the but then I try to look out the window lah I wanted to kaypoh lor
and uh
ah so ya like that lor
so that's what happened
then after that
oh
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah
okay
oh
oh my god
eh that's so bad leh
mm
oh
so that's where I get my news also lah TikTok and Instagram
ya
the presidential debate
ya so
I understand
so ya so then kan
ah you know actually this year
save money so that I can like buy a house here
ah okay
oh
oh
oh oh that's very good
okay
ya
so then it's like
it's like if you have in the reports kan it's already been stated that if you have any underlying conditions
you know or uh
and actually touch all these
ah
ah
and looking forward to phase three lah
okay
ya
oh
mm
okay
okay
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah

ya
so ya so you know I wrote an email to my management err my housing management because like

mm
um
oh okay
korean drama K drama is like
not really my thing lor but then I can try lah see how lah
a'ah
mmhmm
ya exactly
is that the word you were looking for
ya
not so well because I'm not used to it
more of like english songs lah
then
after that
um
ya
so then I was like a bit like
um I don't think that it is
nice for me to
have err to go uh with you on the Vespa one on one
because it would be disrespectful to boyfriend I you know so it's like
and I don't and and I don't think it is it I don't think my boyfriend would be cool with it and I don't think that
it would be cool of me to do it also
weirded out
um
so my birthday dinner is coming up
only you and me
um
mm disrespectful because it's like
like
you know um single so of course it's okay with you
it's nice of you to do that
so I was like okay then I straight up told him
ya because if it's a birthday dinner just you and I it will be very weird
ah
tuesday wednesday thursday I'm free
like asking me to pick the day of
where he is free
but not when I am free
okay
then I said oh weekday I maybe cannot make it
so
time and and happy birthday in advance
um
oh uh don't worry other days I will be spending with my friends then he said you tell me when you are free
but I thought before this you said it will be with your group of friends
and then now you are asking me
I not interested and like you should not be disturbing me
a'ah
okay
so ya
disconnected signal because
he is just not getting it
maybe his brain waves are not getting it but we will see but
mm
ya
huh
the cases it reemerged again
and now they are all back in lockdown
mm
so they are all back in lockdown
mm
mm I think so
mm
and the infection is is more um
the the virus is more infectious
mm
mm
uh
job offers
mm
mm
ya
you
become prolonged because
err
could not handle this COVID situation properly so that's why
ended up the entire
uh nationwide
everybody in the world
did not manage to contain the virus because the two largest countries which is the and
china
were not good at managing it
ya
if it happened in a much smaller country or a much smaller nation it would have been easier to contain
mm
mm
ya
exactly
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
you when you compare to
and it's very diverse that's why people like it here
and
ya
yes lor
hmm so ya
uh and then it's right in the middle of botanical gardens
mm
ya
mm
a'ah
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
um hmm
and then had to like
mm
mm
mm
mm
orh
presentation
oh
ya
ya
oh
oh
ya very like uh demotivating lah
mm
oh
oh media agency lah
mm mmhmm mm mm
mm
like err
ya
ya
mm
ya so
anyway
err
mm ya
okay
okay thank you bye bye

okay hello hi ah amir how are you doing
huh okay ah
doing good err just I don't know
COVID situation
but the same for you lah you're also in army right so err it's just ah social distancing
okay
mmhmm
a'ah what are we doing now
okay understand
mm
ya
ya for for any event you can have hundred people
I think so I'm not sure
I think it's still phase two I think it's still phase two no it's I think it's across like
they take turns ah like in six
ya
I'm not sure I'm not sure that's just what I see lah
ya
mm
yes
uh huh
uh huh
uh huh uh mm ah
mm
next week is it a hypothetical situation or is it actually true
oh actually ah
ah okay okay good
okay lah
a'ah
err
I don't ah nothing much about it it's to me it's err quite interesting what the government is trying to do
cause err
I post that like the last thing I said was err it's a measure
that is focused on
grades
but ultimately the aim is to take
take the focus of parents away from grades ah
ah paradoxical kan
err
like it it
because currently the parents' focus is on grades itself so
what other way to affect them other
other than to take the grades itself ah
really your score
really ah I see
ah I haven't seen that
ah same
no wait no I haven't I didn't I didn't see that part particularly
it was more about more about the transition from primary school err to secondary school lah
as of time
ya ultimately uh what happens err
what secondary school the person goes to will affect their post secondary education yes that's true
ya but I haven't read up enough
anyways I'm not too concerned about err that
but I just found it interesting that's why I read up a bit on it
uh huh
err these days like
like I don't read the news
ya
ah
ya
basically that's the thing
mm
err okay
applicable stuff in my opinion they're doing stuff that
okay not necessary that applicable but they're affecting the society
ya they're actually protecting society but when it comes to army kan
ultimately what is to singapore is manpower
they need the manpower to do stuff like
or
fireworks
I guess
so
err we come from then
we just talk to our own people lah
ah own circle lah ya oh ya
mm
ya these two years not wasted
ya so far
ya ah
ya err
so unless they went out of their way today
uh huh
mm
ah
mm
do anything else
ya true
ah ya I I agree like now is the best time to be in lah
but even in you can do stuff outside you can learn other skills in your free time ah if you have free time which
not everyone has free time honestly
err so army
a lot of people in combat stuff they will train combat stuff
err which wouldn't be applicable lah cause when will we go to war
god forbid ya
no no I'm saying it won't I'm saying it won't yes
because ya it's fighting but as a logistician
I think that the things that I learn err can be applicable lah
err recently I went through this uh ammunition course
then err
ya I learnt
ya I learnt a lot of stuff ah err stuff related to storage
and uh inspection
pretty cool ya
ya we can't talk much about that
ya not
err
going out with my family that rarely happens
ah
oh ya it's it's different
I see
ah easily ah ah
okay mah
uh huh ah okay ah
that's that's true ah
most of the practical
ah
same
ah
family sunday
mm
err ya lah
for me I
I spend
on weekends mostly at home ah
I spend my weekends are mostly at home usually
this usually happens like on a whim lah
so
ya sometimes I just stay at home relax but at home
you talk to your family ah at home
ya
ya that's good
ah
a'ah ya really
ah
ya
ya
mm
good point ya the thing with me is that I have
err
more women at home than men
so ya I only I only get to talk to my father about it but then
every time I go home he always
ask me questions about err when is our commissioning date
or when you will get a number one ah like that err
ya but during err during
err the start of the
ya
ah then okay lah oh I forgot ya you registered at the same time as me
yes
yes
bro I only have two tickets dude
I only had two tickets
oh wow okay that's nice
ah must be western wednesday ah
of course lah
ten days worth of days
ya
ah
that's true that's true ya
ya
yes ya
uh huh
yes
uh huh
mm
that's cool that's cool wait
ah ya you didn't do twenty four uh twenty four kan
in tekong ya that's kind of torturous in my opinion
they didn't have anyone cheering them on
hawker center ah
ya
they were like oh thank you for serving the nation but
we were recruits lah we haven't shit so we haven't done anything yet so
ya
but um is to is to
yes
ya
ah that's a good point ya they just did
ya
ah nine weeks and then next one nine months lah
ah eh I thought it was the end as in I really thought it was over
no I'm kidding
ya it's not for everyone it's okay
ya how about you oh you're going to talk about the pay kan
so err to me okay
it's not much but it's enough for you to spend
err back in kan my my family gave me
two hundred bucks per month
which is a lot less than what I'm getting now but it was
more then enough then
but it's okay
ah okay
ah
ah
ah same
ah
so it's their first experience of getting money
so they get carried away with how much money they're spending lah
they they think that they have a lot to spend so then they buy a lot of
things that they don't really need but
they think they can afford which
because you finally have a lot more money
but the thing is that if you carry that on then
it's as if you had the same amount of money before you just
I don't know okay maybe your
you don't save that's the problem
you just don't save but you just spend more
start saving
ah
mm
ah
mm mm
oh no me too
mm
mm
ya
same
yes yes oh my god
oh
election ah
ya
ya that's how it is but uh personally I also don't
err I don't follow that much
err I I do invest myself
in local stocks so local stocks aren't really affected by the election right
ya but my my coursemates ah oh my gosh everyday
they talk about
like they either talk about used to be they talk about but then finished already
so now they're talking about elections kan every day they will talk about stocks
wah buy this one buy this one sell this one which one more expensive eh ah this one going up the percentages all
ya and err
ya and I don't really keep up
but I understand I think it's good lah I think it's good that
err more of our generation are learning
how to make more money from their money
ya it's
it's good for our future
like in you can save up to twenty thousand
plus plus
if you're smart with it
compared to
us correct
mm
mm
ya that's a good thing ah that's a good thing for the future
we cause right now we're not earning that much right
then when we err get actual jobs we will earn
a lot more a lot more than we do now
and if we carry on with this mentality then it will be good lah
but the thing is that after this
we're going to go through how many years
err
you have to
I have to find a way to either make money or just I don't know I'm personally
no I don't want to burden my parents like honestly I don't want to burden my parents
like they're going to sponsor my I mean okay driving license is not that much ah
but they've been sponsoring my whole life honestly
so
for uni so they don't have to fork out more money for now
ya so
ya
okay
ah
ah
ya
mm
personally I I
I aim to at least save a excess of five K err by the end of
err because I I've I've made a lot of plans ah like I have the investments
and then I also signed up
I got I got tricked into no okay not tricked I got lured into
signing a deal with investment savings plan
insurance oh my gosh yes
a few bucks okay lah about a hundred every every month
that they will take
then save it saves more than a bank of course anything saves better than a bank honestly
interest rates well
so ya just apply and then
other than that I don't know what to do
like maybe I should also start taking down
err how much I spend
that will be better right
yes
mm okay
mm
yes
mmhmm thinking about it's
it's a rookie work yes it's realistic
uh huh
ah
ah
mm
ah
ya actually though
forgot
you're talking about
pay right leading into something else
was it
ya financially independent correct
mm
mm
carry your own weight lah
yes
mm
ya the thing is that of course okay family is written in my blood you know
the they'll be there for life but they won't be there for life like for your life
you know what I'm saying ya the
like eventually you have to live your own life ah so
err you have to start eventually
and now is a good time to start being independent
ya we can yes yes we can that was the idea
that was like we were going to talk about food
ya I don't know it's you it's you you brought it up yes
what ya I don't get it
and like okay in school or like even now
people can talk so much about food I I don't I personally don't get it like wait have you tried this thing
or have you ya
not dude err not about that but what what did you ask amir
what's my favourite food oh snap
err my favourite food is
the scone from texas chicken
the scone the biscuit thing
mm ya
ya
ya
oh
that's true that's true
for the taste or
nugget okay continue
yes
a drumstick
ah
huh
a'ah
ah
yes
ah
ya it's booming
yes
I do too I do too
ya same ah
so you look at malay people you got the highest obesity rate
highest diabetes rate probably I'm guessing
yes it's delicious
okay ya it's not so good for health
ya
you said comfort food right
ban mian ah ban mian
ah okay tom yum
ya
what is like the maggi tom yum
ah
ah
yes that's true
ya
okay understand understand
mm
just so and so ya
when secondary school miss the pe pe
err swimming lesson kan ya then after that
everyone including everyone has maggi
yes
oh my god ya
ya
ya that was the times
ya
it doesn't fill but yes okay maybe back then maybe in primary school in in early secondary it fill
oh it's it's always bulking season it's like in it's it's it's mean
what thousand calories let's say ya ya thousand calories and I think that's not even enough for me
cause of the amount of work I do everyday but it's okay ya it's a eh that's another thing ah
err
sometimes okay there was a point like when I was studying for A levels right when
I was eating almost purely for sustenance
like I was just buying the cheaper stuff like err
what saying yes
wah
are you serious I went up by sixty ah
oh my god
ya
comfort ya it was comfort also okay okay okay
ah
uh huh
yes
ya that was the essence
mm yes it's true
huh
ah yes ya and I didn't mind I didn't mind it
because it was a perk for studying
no the thing is that I mean for sustenance because
I mean it because I would spend five hours inside an aircon room
just going away at my books
or okay I don't okay lah I cannot read for that long but
ya reading and writing doing exercise for five hours and then after that
because I need to eat I will go out and eat
ya so
then after that go back to study ah that's that's what life was like
err doesn't matter as long as it's food
and it's cheap cause money was
I mean okay my family is is in a fortunate enough position to not worry about that but
considering how much I got per month yes
oh oh my gosh oh my gosh
yes
ya and then non muslims also queue up
ya
no but I think it was it's fucker level it was fucker level
and
it technically was illegal in school canteens but it doesn't matter it was good and everyone liked it
ya used to be a secret menu item right
yes
ya
ya
yes
yes
mm
oh was in the canteen yes that's true
I never skipped lectures by the way
that's a that's a very good point yes
no I sleep during lessons that's the thing
ya oh my gosh
the thing is that I still sleep during lessons even now in
nothing has changed
err except I have to study less now so that's good I guess
err no nothing nothing too complex I can make sandwiches but okay
but I still make sandwiches if you think that it's just
taking raw items and putting it between two breads no there's a lot more to making sandwiches the
just take and pop
okay lah even on the pan okay fine I'm making it sound like there's more than it is
yes it is
it's not ya
ya
ya
mm
do you cook
okay
I remember yes
I get that a lot
a'ah lah
yours was half a bite sized
experiment ah experiment ya
ah that's true that's true
a'ah
ya you don't you don't think about that lah as a as a new cook even
yes
they'll just tell you how to do things easiest okay sometimes they does
but even then even then you have to create ourselves
yes
yes ya pretty wholesome
and he dodged my mum
a'ah
ya
eh was that was that trip just for me
oh my god
ah
okay
okay
yes ah
my gosh that was mad you oh wait
ah
ya the things you do I I haven't done anything like that in a long time like
I find myself not doing very kind these days I mean I do
like if I see opportunity like err
for example aunty needs to bring her bags outside the
ya like that I help but
err ya I don't see
like when it comes to friends I don't I don't I never see anymore
mm
ya
why is it
uh huh
okay
mm
ya
ya so
you doing the thing ah doing the thing
yes
yes that's true
yes ya
ya that's the that's the that's the silver lining in helping others lah
that you have to consider their personal dignity
like when I do volunteering also I go to people's houses and I clean their house
there's certain things that they will say don't do this
don't don't wash my dishes that's not for you to do that's for me to do don't mop the floor I can do that
can you just paint the wall
or like reach for the top because I cannot do that
yes
ya so when you help others
like especially old people they only want you
to help when they really need it cause
they they still want to feel able
like putting it bluntly they still want to feel like they can do things on their on their own
ya
mm
ya
ah yes
mm
ya so ya
I don't know I don't know how it got here
ya
ya food
it's not a question okay
uh huh
and that affects the taste
okay I don't know man I don't know
okay
oh yes
yes yes very true very true
yes
ya
fast food lah fast food is easy
mm
ramen
right
yes they can they can appreciate their prices because they're halal ramen stalls
ya
ya
yes
mmhmm
okay ya I think correct ah
ya you can have your pork
ya it's okay ah it doesn't affect me
ya I'm not it's just when I go out with them
ya like I'm your I'm your limiting factor when you decide where to go
but no they say they don't mind though
they say they don't mind
but do they though
ya a couple of times I've I just followed them to where ever they go then I just sit in
ah buy drink buy drink
ah
that's true
yes
not ice cream inside
ya ya your mum always that to put something inside but but I stopped buying I stopped buying though
ya it is it is
ah ya like where we are right now ah
yes
so much
yes yes
oh bro ya ya ya it's okay that was an easy option
and they don't mind ya I mean ya they don't mind
that's true that's true
some will say ya like
ah err halal lah so everyone like once it's halal but then
a lot of the halal food is unhealthy especially malay food
ya it's quite ironic
ya I think ah yes yes malay the malay malay food
ah that ah
ya ya it's very obvious ya
found another fucker
ah
yes
ya
yes
yes malay community
err my gosh like you ask your malay friends
ya it's older generation lah
but you can change the recipe
ya
ah that's true
ya
ya
but they don't ah
ya
yes ya and it tastes nice that we have
ya
uh huh
oh oh everyday
okay
okay
oh so wait the reason why you bring your own food is because it's healthier is it
okay
that's nice that's nice that's nice
sushi okay
err
I'm not sure about that but I think it is also I think it is
ya
definitely
ya by a long shot
wait or oh sashimi itself ya that's true that's true
oh my gosh ya sashimi is so nice like I
ya
have it more often
yes
bubble tea hmm
nah dude okay ya I get it like a lot of people
err I'm not a big fan I cannot appreciate bubble tea
like I I can taste it if
I mean like it's okay if friends are getting it together right ya then I'll chip
I'll buy along ya it's a social thing social thing
I wouldn't get it actually no I do get it on my own sometimes like if I feel like it
but my bubble tea preference is very small
I wouldn't buy the
I wouldn't buy the the tea flavours
ya so
I'm more smoothie I'm more smoothie
ya the oreo crush lah oh my gosh yes yes
Sweet Talk
ah closed
ah
ah
ya
ya student card lah which I still use by the way
no it's not legal
I know
ya imagine if you are out for the whole week how much bubble tea will you buy
yes
ya that's that's the thing
no after we right
err everyday you'll be out like imagine if you go out everyday
like the amount of money you lose compared to the amount of money you save if you signed on six months
is insane
ya ya extend the contract
I don't know no no no I'm actually thinking about it like the six months two K two K plus per month
no no no joke no joke
ah yes yes
I need money bro no but I realise kan
ya
ya
and earn the same amount of money lah
ya
but is easy you're ya you're already there
ya
mmhmm
cooking
let you learn other stuff ah
it's not
ah
huh
I think ya lah definitely

all right
ya
so is it we have a muffler
this one forward a bit ah
is it
shit
I don't know what went wrong ah honestly ah honestly I do not know what went wrong
I I think I did everything fine
and I was actually quite optimistic ah I was like
even if I was the instructor
so like suddenly when when when you need the citation is like okay those who experience this and blah blah blah
so I went over I went over to the mini circuit ah
but yesterday's one okay if he failed me I understood because it has been so long since I ever sat even sat on a bike ah
but apart from that
I think
you know I did I did move from gear one to gear two
but and I don't even okay maybe and then he nobody he didn't mention anything about speeding or whatever
the I think maybe maybe that one was just why I don't know ah cause I'm not sure there's a speed limit in that circuit so
and I accepted it lah ya but today
um I started out with the mini circuit
like it was me and it was that that that that girl lah so I was like okay I say maybe this is the chance ah maybe today I might pass ah that kind of thing
but no
I again today in fact I in fact today I didn't even stall
then I said oh then
then why I cannot the same ride again ah
so
oh so that was me and then about that girl
she was um she was okay she she also failed
you do you do your morning exercise right you do your whatever exercise the back the back ha so she fell there I didn't know because what happened was
I remember at that point of time I was in front of her
and then
because that place is definitely like a corner wall
and there's one mirror there lah
so I I I think when I hit even before I hit that place eh I already down to gear two already even before that ah
no the instructor was there the instructor was standing there ha my instructor was standing there so I think probably he knew that she was gonna screw it up or something like that lah that's why he stood there
so the next thing I knew was whether it's that I saw one bike on the ground and then she was lying down on the ground on the on the on the other side of the face
then after that uh she was trying to pick up the mood
no I was still on my bike
ha instructor instructor was there all the while ha so she help her he helped her out he pull out the bike
ha you concentrate or your bike ha you look in front this and that your cornering I tell you already why you drive so near the wall ah because she when you're making a left turn you're supposed to sway to the right a little bit then you you know it's easier for you to engage the the the the maneuver lah maneuver the the turn but she
so when when you turn on the left side like that
the chances of you going out of your lane after your turn is very high
ha cause it's it's a bend what
okay so
no I didn't see her fall
so she got up everything blah blah blah and then she sat one the bike after that she sat they were asking are you okay like you know you feel any pain anywhere and then she's like no lah I'm okay lah okay
then after that like
after that uh when that when when when when she on her engine already ready to go
uh the instructor tell me he said uh
so after that she she he told me to to to just overtake her kan he say you just go ahead first ah
ha prac one
so throughout the whole entire session nothing went wrong
what what what what was his issue
I do not know
when I got the results I was like
the fuck sial
ya
prac two is a
it's like the salem slope
no to me
really meh you use your foot brake what
really
huh

when you see their their their their how common the bike is ah on the roads ah that tells you how reliable the bike
super four there are people who bring super four which country in indonesia and come back down also also no problem super four quite normal or not ya
no I think it's six hundred hmm mm
four hundred two to two hundred to four hundred right two A
but but the the the the aesthetic of me to say
ah
is it
ya
huh
per two weeks
oh engine oil to oh you change ah ya that's about two weeks lah
sixty
oh ya ya ya mmhmm
but engine oil they have to drain out everything and put a new one right
four four
that one S four that's why they call it super four
mm
forty eight ya
for every
ah
that's why you must get air cooled bike
get the tourer ah get the touring bike
get a short touring bike
uh
it's nice
it looks like bro
eh but do you see the that one that day I showed you or not
it looks like the zontes right

one eight four one eight four is a honda one and because it's the same engine as the as the tourism and the five oh but
fifteen I think sixteen litres ah
fifteen or sixteen I cannot remember
a zontes is twenty

oh

I think ya I heard I heard too
mmhmm
why ask
well this is my question to you but like okay I'll answer
um
that's the real life like this
that's what that's what happening outside and
you know we tend to forget that
we're not we're not the only one we're not
and we're not just the earth doesn't just come by of singapore you know there's other places but we're not sure of how they living the life
and how this these things gonna actually happening in other countries we don't see it in singapore
you know probably like
um serial killers there are some in singapore but it we never know how gore can it be how how how other people could like you know be be that crazy to do something like beyond humanity
mmhmm
um I wouldn't say I remember
but like what gets me is it was black magic kind
you know
black magic usually like from malaysia
like they will kill each other for it or or maybe like family
they kill each other
the daughter kill the mother
or the daughter kill the parents just cause power ya
or drugs
you know how like could be and it turned everything upside down
you know
mmhmm
right
oh ya
it's not there
mmhmm
anything
speaking of existence
um
how do you think human will become extinct
how how
how
yes we've seen a lot of um what do they call it
apocalypse
how human get become extinct
you know how how um how
food or you know mostly movies is like
they eat something wrong and they become zombies
and then they kill and then the whole country becomes
like
like non-productive anymore not not working anymore you know they just become zombieland
what do you think
mmhmm
sure
mmhmm
of course ya cause you're not sure whether you are you're still alive by then
ya how would human extinct how do you think we would extinct like lack of food or you think
virus

what's that
hong-kong
or taiwan taiwan
mmhmm
right
right
softly
is that a song
mmhmm
a cure
ya
a vaccine
right
right
right
but I feel you know what I feel
I feel like you know how scientists are coming up with
there are animals coming from the ocean and the biggest like animals that you've never seen
right right right exactly it's deep down in the ocean still more living under there
and and the fact that whatever they found out now
is already scary and it's already big enough to actually conquer like to scare humans
you know and how humans now are brave enough to actually go
above beyond the ocean that they they can you know they like diving deeper and deep just to find out cause of their curiosity and then I think
at the same time with the virus like you said
you never know what's the next virus
like five years ago or like two years ago we never imagine we have to go out with a mask
SARS
what time is that yes
but you don't have to wear like a mask like a it's not mandatory ya
it wasn't it wasn't
mmhmm
true we're not taking care of our own earth
mmhmm
true
right the icebergs are melting the world are rising
right
so like let's say you know that the world is not doing well
okay what do you think in your power or your might your energy
what would you have done what would you do what would you be doing for that
for the country even though like you don't have much we're just normal people
we don't have much either but what would you do to actually you know
at least just humanity in whatever is happening
what would you do
right
like
influential that's that's it
mmhmm
ya
mm
as long as it doesn't affect our daily food
what we have to care about it
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay speaking of which if you have
um
one meal
or one dish they would eat for the rest of your life
you know let's say the world is not doing good anymore and all like okay we have enough for everybody first one could be but we only supplying this amount of food this type of food for you
for the rest of your life
ya for the rest of your life
I cannot
either meat or spaghetti
ya like
steak
ya steak
you know
we can cook like
we can fry it we can like
boil it
ya
can boil it
make it into a soup or something
you know it could be bland but it still feels like at least I'm eating something you know
you know
kan
that's a sad meal
that's what we have to eat for the rest of our lives
okay
okay now speaking of food right speaking of food
let's say I bring you over to a restaurant
named karma
a restaurant named karma
so by restaurant named karma right
karma is retribution is it retribution
you get what you do
comes around
so if if if I were to bring you to that restaurant
and what do you think you'll be served there's no food just to tell you karma you'll be served on what you have done so what do you think you'll be served
mmhmm
ya
but why
I was rushing for for work
you know like for example that's
you know it could be something like that could be something petty like that but at the same time we could be like
um
mmhmm
ya
ya
what if people judge me
I'm always thinking like that
mmhmm
when you had the time
ya ya
right
I think
I think for me
myself would be um maybe um answering back to my parents
you know
cause I was at the I'm a very stubborn person if I think
I need to answer back like no matter who I would answer back you know and then if um I think there was a time where things wasn't going so well
so there was a time where I feel like I need to answer you back
cause you're not getting you're understanding me ya
so I think
the the dish that will be served for me would be um
ya it would be maybe like a mouth or something a tongue
probably cause I wasn't understanding of their situation either you know I wasn't trying to be
the kid who try to understand I was trying to be like you got to understand me cause I'm growing up
you're adult you know what I mean
ya so it it could be like if related to entering that probably a tongue or a mouth lip
you know
probably I mean
it's gonna be served to you
it's gonna be served to you so I don't know
it's a good one ya
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
I hope so even with my son I feel like if I were to go to this this this restaurant
probably my son I mean like the days where I purposely sleep in cause I don't want to cook you know I'm just like
ya
okay okay
okay I have a question
okay this is a question for you where I think everybody thinks about it everybody um ponder about it it's a dilemma
the question sounds like
would you prefer good looks or a fit body
when we look down uh
we don't want a show off our fats we're only wearing black all the time
you know but it could be you're fit you know you you you be wearing good clothes good body shape just nice you know
um perfect
you could be walking here and there the whole day and you're like okay it's not so tired but you'll be like having acne all over the place
you know you probably have scars
fit body or good looks
ya fit bodies ya
I mean you are with good looks good looks mean you have like a
mmhmm
mmhmm
why would you this is a
mmhmm
ya
ya me too I mean
right
mmhmm
right
anyway I have a child right so
it's like
if I have good looks and I'm unfit
you know I can't be I have to be on par with his energy or I have to be more cause
yet I have to stay from morning before he wakes up and up to the time he's asleep
you know I have to stay throughout the day I can't be like I'm tired and he's not well taken care of
you mean
ya people would be like oh my god pretty mum you know
ya but
but that's it you know what if you're not there for your child's carnival or like you can't run errands
yup
very true very matured
speaking of which since you choose fit right
ya what is it
okay
no
no it's like since you choose fit body so what do you do to keep what what you do to keep your body fit ya
ya
who cares
ya
ya
right
keep the body busy
but I know
I know you you have a high metabolism
right so I don't think I don't know whether it's true for you to actually like lose weight you won't really gain a lot of weight
no
mm
are you blaming on me
ya
right but you should be happy when you are losing your weight
was it was there actually uh a way for you to distress is that the way for you to actually
mmhmm
is it you were doing sports was that why your criteria you had to
like on a certain weight
eating certain things
true
I felt that too
mmhmm
it's bad
what
mmhmm
mmhmm
right
but I think as long as whatever weight you are I mean now
on a healthy weight even though let's say you're sixty or seventy but you're healthy you know you are you are not falling sick all the time you're not visiting the doctor all the time
you're not always like
um eating panadols to to to keep yourself alive I think that's fine
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
just health ya mm ya true cause
partner
oo wow
I feel I feel I think it comes back to this saying cause um you cannot have
no serious okay no if let's say ya I used to go for looks cause I don't do much to them you know what I mean and what I meant is like
uh they could be they they they just have to look good cause I want to look good
with them ya
like do I have a good
good appearance
ya example like but now more of like you're gonna do errands with me you know you got
no I'm not looking for a maid maid is like care for my job for my chores at home but what I mean is like
as long as they are healthy as long as um healthy being um happily not depressed not forced
you know they are happy and
they feel like whatever they are they know that they are loved
by their partner
you know they don't have to be like oh I have breakouts and you know like you gonna leave me you know I don't I
why
just use moisturiser or something I try to tell you that a lot of times you know
okay so for last question would be
if um
if you had a wish now
in this age and day
what would you wish for
what would you wish for that would
um like something that would help you with your life right now
you don't want to be materialistic
mmhmm
a money and house
or house
ya ya ya just only one
or house
is that what you're working towards to now
mmhmm
of course it does everything needs money
mmhmm
like it makes you feel satisfied too you feel like you have done your part at least you make other people life easier to you know like you could help with chores
like buying for them
things for their needs
mmhmm
you wish for that
okay for me I feel like I would want a house
a good house or I could really build
a home where you know um
it's comfortable it's big enough
it doesn't have to follow like the house you know the singapore standard house it I want to have like a a good
maybe
ya like it could be
beyond my imagination you know I just want a house with this big and then the final product would be however it be like you know I don't want the room to be this small but I want to be this big but it could be
end up a more than how many square feet
square foot it is you know
right
ya
for sure
mmhmm
right
mmhmm
mm
they have better
right
mmhmm
right
okay

thank you
sexual health
there's like sexual health plastic surgery you know personal finance take stock is a treasure trove if you know how to use it well
okay so the you know the um with a song that I showed you just now is it's it's basically um it's a K pop song by shinee
um ya so um so how they use it on tiktok is like it's either the humorous or funny uh K pop humour the the jokes on tiktok or it's like used by like thirst traps you know
it's I never heard I never heard
oh okay okay uh maybe I think so like you know pull you like in to my side
I recently learn this term it's called um um
kissing my teeth but if you've seen it on twitter stands for kissing my teeth
so like for example uh
what what's the oh ya ya ya ya I know it's so true oh my god
eh nasha
ah I mean like that number ah the number the number of hours I'll be on tiktok everyday is just ridiculous
so um like on on on wednesday because I was working from home
like I finish work at six right immediately you know like for me right it's very clear
I stayed there for three hours
scrolling endless scrolling and I didn't realise that three hours had passed until my sister knock on my door
it's so addictive I love it
I learn so much I love it
ya that's that's the tea
I got into
um because I saw quite a bit of it on on twitter right because tiktok videos are very easily uh loaded and shared and I think that's one of the main um
main powers or main advantages of tiktok like for for instagram it's it's not very easy for you to port over or to share if you share like err an instagram post it always comes in a link but whereas for tiktok videos you can download it and you can share it on uh any
uh any any app any social media app
like like it's like a native post which is great
here you are native post
ah tiktok is the same
but it's just not on your page cause it's well curated oh I see it is on your page
what have you been watching
right right and sometimes like you know when you want to test out if a video is gonna be popular so you just show like on on on your even though it's not your scene so if you like it
so that so that
ya the algorithm so don't know whether it's popular or not just randomly give to bunch of people and if there's a high percentage of people who like the video then they spread it even more
so that's why sometimes you realize eh you got videos will have about fifty or sixty and just kept there doesn't load so once uh once it realizes that eh this video isn't as popular as with the other users then it just doesn't show anymore
so that's how they determine the priority
correct correct yes yes they really wanna see that
yes
or is it you don't want grab ge</mandarin to see you
oh wow
oh oh wow amazing wow
grab ge</mandarin knows you but you don't know his name
okay okay okay
wait so when you say that you gave him coins like how does it work cause I'm not familiar with the contract

oh oh okay okay okay
mm
you want to try it out
then how do the other students like do they catch up or are they behind
like the first thing cause I would maybe I was to focus on like myself but I didn't notice the second it was fine because I was surrounded by jokers
oh right right right
something ya
just breathe what's the studio called by
oh right so I'd just
ah beat factory
how many phones do you have
oh my god this one
is it for your games
so the new phone is on for your games
wow
is that his live dah start
mm
that is not much
oh damn
okay lah
mm mm
oh then you can be like you need to contact your students
like if it's like dah you know after school hours like set one side oh my god that's a very good idea
mm
okay okay
oh okay okay
right
okay
oh ah oh what the qualities
oh oh my god
there's a post to his live now
all these ge</mandarin watching on a saturday night
ah
mmhmm
aww
do both right right right
so like one phone is like watching his live and the other phone is like your maples lah
hashtag
multifunction
be up to be like her for real like give me listening to guide to grab food in like reading chinese novel play what bro
you and that was a that was the plot twist that I did not see to be honest
what's the point where do you where I don't like I thought that you know you should you should explicitly referring to like japanese stuff anyway you probably won't go the other way sitting right
ya
but it's okay sis you got what you call that you got range
it's what
ya you got range
what's your exact the plot twist that I didn't quite expect you know watching anime
ya I've I really truly enjoy watching saturday and ya I'm so ashamed for like you know you know anyways but I'm I'm watching I don't know if you know this show it's got saiki
the disastrous life of saiki
oh that's good
but it's very very promising and I might start on it
okay okay so I might I start ya so this one is more of like um slightly modern japan and it's basically revolving around this character called saiki um
like exploded
strength ah yes yes yes so I was like talking about like
powerful strength and he can also uh teleport um
he he can he has pyrokinesis or something so he can like keep himself warm literally any power you can think of
he could do that too
like like literally like any power you can think of he has it so the whole anime
ya it's just him
the whole anime revolves around him and his life in school like how he's trying to keep uh people like his close friends from knowing what his power is and the most interesting thing is that throughout the whole anime he never opens his mouth
ya
so it's just so because he also has telepathy
um you can hear his voice but you won't see him open his mouth
people can hear I I guess the thing is people don't realize it but they're hearing his voice through telepathy
my one hour is so precious while I heat up my food and go eat right
I watch three episodes
it's twenty minutes long
okay fine like twenty one twenty two minutes I okay may have taken more than
I don't skip I love everything about it
um I don't know it's about twenty three plus
ya but I still can't finish
and I watched that many episodes for lunchtime and also I'm like wow
right right I should have finished like one season
ya ya
oh ya ya ya ya
I'm starting there
ya you really have to get into it
oh
maybe it's just like the frequencies type of things
yes
drama
those I vaguely recall watching a gundam series on kids central
oh
ya
mm mm
yes yes
yes
mmhmm
ya
okay okay
mm
that's very interesting I've actually thought of that
fact gundam I all I all I remember is I I watched it but it's more of like background noise
cause never really got into it
mmhmm
oh okay okay
hmm
it was really good
back then like when you thought it was good and then you check further more into gundam and you're like no
gundam
ah it fits out quite nicely thank goodness cause she's actually quite pudgy now um
so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't internet lah correct
um so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't she wouldn't fit into the jacket
but thankfully it fits and she was like okay nevermind it's not my favourite team but it's okay I like it okay good you know that's great
and she hasn't taken it off like when I left the house she's still wearing it
she loves it so much
me too so I think
ah no I think it's still with aisyah okay nevermind that's fine
ya so um
I I told her like eh sorry ah I really cannot bring you because sixteen and I don't want you to start thinking that movie ratings are just a suggestion even even if it is like I want you to take them seriously but didn't tell her that of course you know because that would um
they would insinuate that some people don't take it seriously told her like sorry movie rating is sixteen and you're not sixteen so you cannot watch um
but some countries
she knows but some countries its thirteen I saw ah I saw on reddit she's on fucking reddit
it is where I feel like you need to be ready it but
ya um it's it takes some getting used to but reddit can be particularly useful when like for example okay back then when I was really into my like fitness craze um there was some like reddit pages like how to lose with reddit
or like the before and after reddit so this kind like you when you follow you get along motivation from people cause it's super positive so it really depends lah or it's more of like Q&A or like one of my favorites is err five which is explain like I'm five
so ya so like you know and they have like really um topics that you don't understand like uh explain like I'm five what is bitcoin and someone will explain it to you in a clearer simple english so it can be beneficial but it can also be like a cesspool
and there was like this particular Reddit page was so I'm now more if you but I used to follow it because um
I like to read like I like tea you know to um
and it was on relationships or like am I the asshole
ya so at first it was really really fun because like you know you get to see like
for one of the commenters their suggestions or with their um comments is always oh this guy is definitely an asshole break up with him break up with him even though it's like things like marriage
or like ya it's like a marriage like leave this guy he's not fit to be like your husband or this
the the father of the children I'm like these are really drastic opinions that you have like you I get it that you know I I feel like just from one activity like this you cannot just say things like that
stop being freaking childish
correct correct so even though like
maybe from the description like the situations really really bad lah I feel like there are many other ways to resolve it rather than leave the man he's trash his men disposal service I'm telling you that you this man is screwed up
ya ya
so you mean if the person is really lost or really confused and they see all these responses and the ones with the most therefore you know endorsements from people is divorce the man
so
oh ya so back to ah so um so I asked her like uh can you give like uh
like a summary of the story cause I couldn't catch up without having to be dark somewhere lah and she was like
no you don't want to bring me nevermind it's okay but you want to know more then you better binge watch by yourself
then I was like goodness me this person
which of course you know you only have one season so yesterday
izz can easily catch up eh
ah okay lah not bad lah
oh yes
not bad
and I'm like you're not thirteen yet you just turned twelve last month she's just like I'll find a way
mm
ah
ya ya ya okay
sub technically I got a
but ya
I'm also trying to think that where is the sixteen is from the blood from the slashing of men
oh okay okay okay
all right all right okay okay send
oh my god okay okay but you know I only realize how important we think when I watched
um this movie I think it's called the spy movie I watched it with sha it was after A levels
um I watched it at downtown east so essentially the story is about uh this dowdy the spy support executive or something played by
um came up a name something mccarthy
this pudgy comedian um
okay nevermind so there was this like okay so there was this um spies
no no it's not jesse mccartney
but
it was a spy movie and it was I think M eighteen I mean we were nineteen back then like you know you could easily walk in
ya
so then we walked in and we watched a movie and that was the first time I saw a like a real life actual dick
ya
wow really he's fine movie it's all netflix you have netflix actually I mean I do I mean not that you wouldn't want to watch you just because somebody but what's my first sign on only
ya it was a spy movie it's on netflix are you on netflix I should take you
I mean not that you would want to watch it just because of the but it was my first time an I wanna what
I'll just keep it to myself
I was so surprised I was really taken aback because I will just was not expecting
it's not not full frontal it's literally a close up because okay so the scene was um a man who accidentally to or rather a man is taking some sex videos
so he actually zoom in into like his own like a dick
so that was the scene and uh so he was videotaped right and then the spies executive who became a spy
was looking through the content inside the camcorder and she she came across that I'm like wait what
I couldn't believe that a comedy movies staring that comedian was was going to show me my first ever dick
ya so after that
he was pretty normal about it I think
ya I'm pretty sure
I was like oh I was really full I couldn't pay attention for the next ten minutes
ya then I was like okay so that's how a dick looks like in real life thank you um
and then ya so I guess from then on I realise how important ratings were
and also like you know you when it's M eighteen
when it's R twenty one you better make sure that you know
I was not prepared
uh huh like nudity or sexual references uh ya but normally when you see those you like you're not too bothered by it because you've seen it before and they're like ending oh it's probably just the butt or something
so that was very interesting
ya I was legal and I knew what it looked like comically I suppose
but I was just I didn't expect to see it on big screen
mm
what I get to is shooting up then I'm like oh okay wow
that was like twenty fifteen and I still remember it oh my goodness
ya I was so shy he was very indifferent about I was like it was a lot
ya alah
ah right right right
ya
ya ya honestly like I mean it it does feel like a burden sometimes by I feel like if I don't do it who else is going to do it and I really you just hope that she sees it as me
guiding her through this rather than me telling her no cannot this one cannot
so like for me it's always about
um this is not the time for you to explore such things here
and the good thing is that she doesn't run away from this kind of conversations
she sits and she is squirmish she's very like a little bit uncomfortable
like when we talk about like watching you know ya wey or like whatever she's like a bit squirmish but
we have have to sit through this
I think she's more intrigued than interested she just wants to find out like what is it or if if it's like this like okay it started out with haikyu she was really into haikyu her friends got into it and naturally because this is about competition this is about brotherhood
it dwells into a little bit of that area of boy's love their only thing
so I really had to just guide her a bit and making sure that she understands that um but whatever she's reading is not necessarily normal in an irregular relationship ya
I just wanted to like impact her brain not this early please
the strange perceptions there
I mean I honestly can't speak for you so I don't know
ya it's like how when I watch those malaysian romance uh series
when I was younger lah when I was like sixteen seventeen eighteen
a'ah
it really impacted the way um I saw how relationships or is
then like you must always listen to your husband and the husband
ya and when I look back and I'm like no no no like
when I interim put that my malaysian friend offer is like
why
take actually to check out eatery do like
ya
he came back and he is on track to take over his father's business
ya and his father is like a a celebrity preacher
wrong wrong islamic consultancy maybe
so uh so he's a very popular
preacher on on and when he came back he is slated to take over the father's business
cause you pick your nice actually somebody you know I didn't Q&A session are we I no one is it
and then like the questions were apparently very you know intriguing and like uh thought provoking he wanted to know who it was from turns out um it was from this girl
and it turns out to be like a a prostitute from like a nearby neighbour
so he was intrigued and ya plot twist
so like his initial um like emotional said he felt
like disgusted but still
like respectful the person like
these sort of kind of questions that you know you coming away based on like you gonna talk provoking questions at the same time like oh my god you're a prostitute man you know you can have a you can have uh this kind of like
uh ya ya ya they asked I can't remember what the questions were
uh fundamentals one thing and then there's also like you know the typical questions that people would
ask when they're venturing more into the
into the religion without any guidance it's more of like um
one of the basic ones was why are there so many like why do bad things happen to good people kind of random things ya
yes it is idiot
so okay so tup tup they ended up getting married
yes
I know I know done with the question about everything so uh he was looking for her
a'ah
ya ya I think some of them he didn't address on the spot cause he didn't know how to answer
so he was like um like between a couple of weeks or two three weeks he kept taking all these anonymous questions that are very different answer
know who so when he found out he was like oh my god I need to find this girl and he really went down to the neighbourhoods to find her so I was like okay lah when I watch this okay fine this one can I can brain everything um
but the the ridiculous part was when they got married
ha it's very unrealistic I feel like people will have broken at some point
she could have
I mean um the way that the mother
the mother mother-in-law was treating her also
ya but I have to say that it was somehow the better ones
with uh starting mira filzah and if you know adi putra
so okay okay nope the most ridiculous parts was when first mira filzah was twenty four seven

so difficult lah logically

wait
aiyo
among us among us
ya you said like that it's among us
I don't know eh I feel like this type of thing ya obviously
mm
oh ya ya ya ya ya he's he's a very soft guy
which is good but sometimes not good because
ya exactly
then I feel like it's pointless lah honestly I mean I don't mind giving him advices so that he will be aware of like whatever that is gonna happen that he have never experience before but at the same time if
a bit tiring lah can say
cause I know that he will still love me even I look ugly or what
dress up a lot and I wear makeup a lot then
think four
four fifty
about there lah
ya
I feel like that's why ah
and like I don't know why I don't see the point of
oh like that okay lah
mm mm oh oh
a'ah
okay okay
oh ya
light light festival ya
scare khine
I don't know and I was quite shock that she actually told me eh oh really ah oh ya ya that one I told you right that was quite good eh good acting girl
oh my gosh damn I miss being in the same class as you sia stupid
I cannot be friend I cannot like someone when that someone is my friend
ya
but I really like our friendship sia it's really quite unexpected sia honestly
honestly I didn't really want to make friends so with anybody because every semester I have to change class do you think it will work

okay
ya okay okay got it
yup
but it's also the whole heavy thing lah once again to have to drag in her luggage or or I don't know couldn't tweet
hmm send it to her
you name it lah they will print it on something and it's digital printing which means you don't need a like must order minimum hundred or what can even give her of our faces to wear on which day today I feel like a sham day
today ya ya correct correct
ya ya ya ya ya and when she lonely she can talk to the picture
ah guys I need some advice
ya ya okay
so ya I think I think vista print all this website got ah and I think this that would be the same website that also makes a photo book
you know what I do after awhile I throw it out I don't like clutter
eh I've had to throw all sorts of things in my life in order to like fit it into this house and also when I went overseas to work
much I don't have pictures of people from secondary school all bird fly high hard to catch friends like you hard to forget I don't I I never bothered to keep those things I feel like um if you want me you know where to find me ah then we can hang out
ah I don't I don't know ya so anyway photo book wasn't the best thing lah but I thought some pictures or or the other thing is we give her a bunch of pictures that are nicely printed and then we order the thing online say buy from amazon but it to be delivered to where she is ah
ah
like super glam shit and then we like then can pin the poster have like cool headline or what then write some funny copyrighting for venue and
date you know that kind of thing like date that when
ya ya I know I know I know ya ya ya ya ya and I think actually that's what she prefers too but I suspect when she she said that time that cause she wasn't even sure whether this is happening like whether they're gonna be able to secure the mortgage get the place there and be able to you know actually move lah
but then I suspect once it's confirmed there got iskandar is settled there is a flight date ticket
confirm she want to meet everybody and his brother so I suspect there will be a bigger thing
I don't know how big is big err when where how we're going to do it in groups of five as per the government guidelines
but
but for us I think I don't know is it just come over here and do our usual or is it want to have like a a lovely dinner outside somewhere
okay ya I'd like that
fuck so all these by the end of the month okay
ya I'm ya ya ya and she has this fear of
to do with the two of them yes yes
what are people thinking of me
yes she has
ya ya she's definitely discovered
they flocked to her ah all the little malay girls on the floor the little mod girls
they love her
ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya
ah ah ah
cause that was the day that you found out I see okay got it
ah ah ah ah ah
ya ya ya ya
fuck lah she's such an integral part of the group I'm gonna miss her like hell man
I've had it with you all yup ya ya ya ya ya ya
ah my understanding is that the the guy was playing the both of them and then sarah beef
with you was that you were talking about it to both sides
okay
ah ah ah ah ah
ya ya ya ya
so all this was happening like at the same time while he's flirting with sarah he also like cuddling up with tini what the hell man
ya ya ya ya ya
yup
alamak
uh huh
wait this was the day we went to eat pizza
fish I didn't know the pizza had such undertones so when you brought up pizza thing I thought you had something to do with she coming but not feeling like eating but then is it she no need to contribute to the bill you know I thought it was that sort of like bill and who pays what drama fuck okay okay okay
yes
yup
yup
ya
so did sarah know that jas was doing this with tini
she didn't know either okay got it
ah
ya ya ya ya ya ya
so what was tini first reaction then when you said she went bitch mode
okay
ah
ya ya ya ya ya okay
then she come down for what
ah ah ah ah
right
ah ah ah
okay
that's right
ya okay got it
yup
ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya yup
that is not nice explain
like a party girl no
yup
ya that's the you cannot correct correct you can't mould other people's perceptions lah ya ya ya
ah that jas is playing that jas correct correct cause tini was like totally completely oblivious to it right she didn't know ya she didn't know sarah didn't know as well but tini felt like the person who was
losing her heart over him ah it sounds like it like like tini really was quite set on it being rather serious
ya
ya ya ya ya ya so it's a it's a big deal for and she must have been really hurt
mm
when there are friendly things you don't reciprocate ya
mm
ya ya ya ya I remember that
ya
okay
just even indulge in gossip you get what I mean ya ya I know you don't do that either
okay
ya ya ya ya ya
ya
okay
yes
ya ya ya ya you you have no control over this lah ya
yup
so probably just a bit more careful lah when how she speaks lah
yup yup yup yup yup yup
I mean one wishes it never happen in the first place but friendships will go up and down lah it's like that lah sometimes there are just little areas you don't go to finish ya ya I think it's it's it
it's the sort of thing that you think about when you are thinking about how valuable is this person to me what sort of a friend it is it's not just the happy moments that you will think about but it's also about the bad moments that you guys were able to patch up together and that I think really adds to the value of the friendship you know the amount of work you put into it
ya
yup
correct obviously there's a lot of censorship going on yes ya
friction
yup
yup
yup yup yup yup it's how you then deal with it together that matters
ya
ya ya ya
yes nisa likes to set boundaries you know I like I like I've learnt a lot about setting boundaries from how nisa does it I'm afraid I'm not comfortable with this so I'm not going to do it ya and and it's
it it comes as a surprise to people that I use it on I don't know if it's cause maybe when I say it I don't see it as nicely or sweetly as nisa but I've noticed a lot of people like eyebrows raised when I draw this kind of boundaries
I I really think that's missing ah in schools ah how to politely draw line you know
ah ah correct and it can be done very politely no one's trying to hurt your feelings here you know
ah ah ah ah
there was definitely silence after I said that like it hung in the room for awhile
three seconds then err then continue lah but I was
truly unapologetic cause it was too late at night and my brain was just ya not having it like I don't even have the capacity to have it even if I wanted to you know I don't have the capacity sorry it's too late
err
oh okay okay okay
oh okay so there is a possibility he might come is it oh okay cool
ah eh I can't talk now I'm sorry I'm doing the recording ah
oh oh ya dude we were just talking about you
or maybe he has left okay
okay so I don't know do you want like tackle the questions that we had okay we are halfway through so it's not too bad um but ya
it's taking a bit longer than expected cause I think it's cause the antibiotics are making my mouth like damn dry so next time I do this sia I need water need what what
god I hate this medication so much
huh natural things
no cause it's it it's means it put in effort if somebody just walks up to me and give it to me now I will gladly drink it I will so gladly drink it I just can't be asked even get up go to the toilet cause it hurts so I'm not gonna go and no I don't think so
I don't think so
did not reply to message until next day five o'clock like hello ya hi no not today I'm not coming today I got I got migraine
huh I don't know why the soldiers didn't cook in the tank sia
like steamboat ah oh inside the tank got aircon
singapore
as long as I got my aircon
okay ya so I saw all that but then I think later on in the day I saw one facebook video of like tank it was quite surreal the tank go past but the the guy whose job it is to kill people with this tank is just waving very happily I'm like wow this isn't what I'm paying my soldiers for you know who ask you to wave
ah okay but can't see it ah
ya ya ya ya ya
oh that's cool
I was working that night mm mm
err
ya I don't know why cause ya it was interesting it was just so uneventful
err if you could
oh god I completely forgot all the questions I don't know what they want
memorable meal
you know I can't even think of one
okay maybe got one where my boss brings us to this like restaurant in bali it's called mosaic and it was super fucking posh and not just that but it was it took indonesian
and then wove it all into a menu that was that told a story ah from start to end and then at each point for each dish
that's such a great way to make it like another dimension you know to add on that's cool
off the top of your head
okay
oh
ah
ah ah ah oh my god then you just take the whole thing ah ah ah
ah
don't break don't break
yup
and wah
yes it's the moments ah saffron ah saffron
ah ah ah
ya ya ya
I can imagine
I have a direct bus to tampines here not even at the interchange you know
one two seven
could be yup
ya ya ya
tampines ya got
so that's the end station in mind
ya zoo is ang mo kio lah ya ya ya
ya that used to be my commute wah and another way that I used to commute was how ah oh no this one is when I go home time I take from the zoo but then I stop somewhere along thomson road upper thomson there then I take a bus down I walk there I come down to braddell braddell view then I walk home ah
it was a nice walk home
today is
to get a response so I guess it hasn't been three weeks but I'm also a bit sad
accordingly lah cause I will be putting in a lot more work um then the other concern is also when I went online when I tried to look for like you know services like this kan
I want to lie in bed and watch
so I guess not having it is something we've been saying recently ah not having it
I I haven't heard it you started using it
not having it
no mood ah
then it doesn't help that my stupid boils keep happening
and I'm so incapacitated
okay so that was memorable meal
that took awhile
okay cool
ya also I provided an update about my current job hunt tight situation
oh um
I I don't remember one
oh if people didn't have to work what would they do right
okay so this is
ah actually it is I like this things
like I I if I really had money right then I didn't have to worry about food then I would I don't know then maybe I might be asked to cook cause I know I can buy whatever ingredient I want for example you know
an issue ya
ah ah ah ah ah
correct correct correct exactly
ya correct the info is all there and we know it it's
correct
correct correct
ah ah ah ah ah
ya
yup yup yup yup
doing this sort of things
ah correct correct maybe finally have a ant farm
don't know leh I mean if if I feel like maybe not sure or what I got questions then maybe I can call ryan
hi ryan ya his name is ryan so beautiful
I could see all the other mums over there were all like hyperventilating man
coach her ah
his name is ryan and he works at the ant museum at katong for little while he was the favourite of all the mothers
mm mm
so confidently
ya he had a very good err speaking persona unlike unlike his other there's one other colleague girl I think was quite good
but there was know there was one guy that I was like like making serious enquiries lah about how much actually is it gonna cost me to come up with my own anterrium and all these and he was
a bit like don't really answer the question and will roam the point a bit before getting into it be like oh okay
of course
but of course
you think he knows
okay
ya I think it's no more it was extended for awhile but I'm very sure COVID would have closed it lah it's too small and too um
ah ah ah ah
oh okay okay okay then get into it like damn obsessively and do terrariums that are like artistic
I think those books ruin a lot of young women you know
I don't know they were fun haiya I definitely went through a period of them I even use to shoplift them these romance novels ya man but then you know what I do or not will take out and then put the ones I took the last time
I don't know why I went through a phase in secondary school ah it's a bit punk I supposed property is theft um
yup
party eh
got sex one ah
oh specifically ya okay okay okay
okay okay okay
okay okay okay ya I've heard it I've heard it for sure I just wasn't completely sure
code words ah ah ah ah this is like codeswitching within codeswitching
matrep ah ah
ah
ah ah ah ah
ah ah
right
ah ah ah ah
yup yup
oh
ah ah ah ah ah
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
oh
oh
ah
ah
ah
oh camouflage ah
ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya yup yup
to make it more obvious right
right
yup
right
I never knew marsiling was okay okay okay
oh
ya ya ya
right okay okay
there's a lot of looking ah
ah
ah
oh my goodness what an experience for them
yup
yup that's very nice
true true true true
correct correct
correct they grow up in a very different world ya
yup I think they are more open to new things they don't have prejudgements as much as us ya ya
that's so cute ah ah ah
ya
right okay
yup
yup
yup
these kids ah
ya how beautiful what a gorgeous story
ya ya ya ya
so a lot of brown people step forward lah as supposed to chinese people little things like that you know
and it didn't occur to me even that I had that I didn't have this privileges
that wasn't my point my point was one guy towards the back of the room who obviously grow up with a lot of privileges crying ah sobbing like a baby cause that exercise got to him to the point where he just felt like
had it right but no lah the the it's just the way he cried it it really reminded me of what you were saying about the younger people in who see the world a bit differently but then they don't understand why everything cannot be equal you know whereas for us
so then maybe that was a shock to our system compared to them who was already born with a world where you cannot expect anything will happen at any time ya maybe for them it's a different way of looking at things I don't know
sundilah
ah
that was really weird and and tone deaf I thought this this election got a lot of things that were tone deaf ah from the side
firm that may not have I don't know many people that are representatives I don't know man
people's voice kan
ah ah
I see I see I see
ya ya ya ya
your vote now
ya I don't think it matters
for singapore supporting the government cause of covered walkways
sundilah it's one hour
okay then one two three

I'm planning to lik
two lah because the um the flat will only be ready in middle twenty not really middle lah early twenty twenty three so logically is the year before lah ah
err so like I mean if I were to move as in just yesterday we were discussing lik
err
so it doesn't make sense lah to travel from the west to the east the east to the west then after tha
ah the one definite lah
so that one will take time definitely don't know how long it take lah bu
definitely will have to stay at one place first lah it's either my side or his side lah
so that's why the the the budget is a concern lah
um
oh it's not like one whole thin
but but then if you do everything at once right it's save time righ
for the location if let's say you want to do for bridal then do photography videograph
chey
err they have catering they have decoration with including the err plumbing also and then err they include the door gift
and then err tables and chairs all set up all the basic everything is there except that the only thing that top up that one is just and
such old school you have to follow according to what happened last time so we must have everything must have a big wedding so my concern is that if I cannot afford I mean not he cannot afford lah if I cannot commit to tha
another fact is that I'm the first one I'm the first child so obviously as a father want to show off mah so like err very proud you know finally you know somebody err my my child is getting married or whatever but the
alah they don't know the the cost to get tha
err there's no need for any vehicle lah I mean there's only just need one way lah just to do the whatever photo shoot after the weddin
ah that's why at least everything will be there so for example if let's say you do at orchard at that hote
at least you know the night before stay one night after that ah want to get ready just go dow
burning hair to think of i
I suggested to my mum lah like come lah to meet me and give me advice lah
I don't know like nowadays people like I mean due to this pandemic kan
so people are starting to to get married now because due to limited in capacity kan because my own friend also she's getting married on end of the yea
but then because is they have to top up more s
uh manage to find at this particular location somewhere in the west lah so uh it's not a location that is suitable for wedding lah it's more to like education wis
ah so err they had to actually emerged certain rooms to become one big roo
something like you know those typical conference room meeting room right so um no not they had to make this type of compromise but at least its it does not affect in a way that they have to top up mor
they are is still within their budget but their problem is right because now you cannot have buffet you have to give bento bo
the balance of the money that supposed to be deposited for the wedding right she actually used to take out one more photographe
ah so at least you know you don't have to be stuck with just one so you just two so after that uh
became because of that also one good thing lah I mean not about travel so she splurge out her so called honeymoon in singapore err
ya lah the week after the wedding lah she will do that means like I think mayb
within december lah she'll she'll do honeymoo
it'll take about like a yea
so the next one will be second time already which has a lower chance of ballo
alternativ
ya that was the initial plan but you know lah as usual pay me but then
the groom side is giving a gift lah to the bride side is i
is it err oh
ya but some people still want to display the notes righ
ya ya true dare to it y
err so is there a magazine is through Facebook lah so this lady was cheated and um you know I jus
why you go and marry the guy if you know that you're not ready for it if you're not financially already s
that's the thing lah and when it comes to this thing as in wedding and marriage it all comes down back to mone
if you they will the basically right their terms like if you have more guests is cheaper so to avoid tha
as in basically kan you need to have okay ah for example like that that that particular location at orchard err it's for one thousand person is about twenty plus plus per perso
then another company is offering that oh if let's say you wanted maybe about five hundred people lah ya for both side that means two fifty each right then it'll cost about the same pric
or maybe slightly more but of course lah about thirty dollar plus plus and then leh I compared those tw
they only offering two then drinks also is like oh asia's err hot tea coffee and then like one cold drin
this this one is the one that another company lah not the one at orchard is another company so to me is that ya your food is nice your decoration is very nice we went to th
showcase and is all very nice very tempting and they even offered multiple locations but you offer your location but then you
package is so not good it's difficult you know and then uh there was one time err the package includes brida
you compared the price of each eh to a brida
stay we will just stay until until the end even until the end also nobody else will just stay right maybe about ten minutes or s
um we will only book one event for one da

so far I think they're okay just that the girl is going to primary one now

I'm actually looking for a tuition teacher now for her do you think I'm crazy
ya but singapore is so competitive I'm just worried about her
hais
what do you think

mm but I still think like we need
a tuition teacher because my husband feel feel that we should start young eh you got any tuition friend or not
tuition teacher
ah but I think there are different rates for this
maybe about forty to fifty
I want them to come to my house lah I don't want to travel out already very tiring you know
good good thank you thank you
eh so uh you wanna sit down somewhere like coffeeshop or something
where got atas you lah you work in what museum don't know what I not working eh

ya lah my
wait lah
ya
actually true lah because every time I fetch my kids ah then I see the maid like
just on their phone ah then never never even like take care of the kids some of them just allow the kids to run haiya crazy ah I don't know why this
these err their bosses ah never check on them
abuse
ya lah so
abuse what you mean by you abuse
so serious
orh you see lah I stay home so long ah never even read news hais I think I must start reading news to keep up myself
ya eh now COVID then how they want to engage maid
can or not ah
I think I rather stay home
keep my home clean
mm
mm
five days
so
oh
wah
hmm
mm
mm
uh huh
oh mm
stress at work
mm
ah
eh mm now got what exhibition over there
wow mm
but
mm
mm
mm
so a lot of people uh take leave
eh you redeem already
hmm
managed to book a few
attraction
so I don't know how it works
orh
mm
ya that's true
go johor
and then I can buy all my baking stuff
ya
but now COVID I don't have you know we we can't travel out and then everything over here is so expensive
so at least when I I get to go johor at least I make a bit more profit
mm
mm
ya
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya that's true lah eh you know about talking about government ah they give the free mask new one I haven't collect yet and then the the best thing is they have the
the mask for kids so just have to measure
how big is your face if I'm not wrong
ah then my friend tried it then
well
know
ya
mm
mm
mm
kan the cases just go up and you don't know who is infected
mm
mm
mm
mm but I think this year challenging but
something different so meaning we can actually live without
going out of the country lah but of course at one point we
we are bored
like my kids keep on asking me when are we going holiday
because we usually go um
like malaysia every week every saturday or sunday
but now we're always staying at home you know I have to come up with some activities for them ya
mm
ya that's true
mm
ya
I think more for us about
we don't have um
enough people it's about
so most of them are affected and then if you see think my husband said that about the homeless people not homeless lah
place to sleep and they even have some like basket food
to to give to the malaysians stranded in singapore
ya
daily ah mm
mm
mm
wah eh you never undergo swab test before right
that's good that's good
mm mm
okay
mm
ah
mm
hmm
oh
fifteen dollars per hour
mmhmm
hmm
expose lah
oh
mm
precautionary order at mm
housewife just like me
mm
mmhmm
they know better lah
mm
mm
mm
that's true
eh ah I wanted to ask you something
your you have any friends who
who sell cheap mask or not
mmhmm
huh
is
we'll see
uh huh
a few cartons
mm
ya that's true
then you know kids keep on
hmm
ya maybe I should just by those reusable ones
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
can lah if not you can just order in
mm
ya that's true
mm but it's quite expensive lah but
they're at home doing the same thing so I think a staycation would be a good getaway for them
eh
everything in the supermarket is like sold out
even the smallest things like what like ketchup or chilli sauce it's very hard to find the brand that you always use
do you agree
mm
mm
hmm ya
ya that's true but it's not very cheap you know so what I do was I borrowed my brother's laptop for my kids which is a hassle lah but lucky he is not using because he's uh on the airline industry so he doesn't need the laptop so imagine if I don't have because everyone every single singaporean needs a laptop
mm
ya that's true
hmm
ya that's true
mm
ya
ya
ya very poor thing for those who have been retrenched lah I think I would rather have a pay cut
than not having a job
what about you what do you think
having nothing right ya
hmm
some of them even went to uh try
wah it's really you have to work extra hard for this uh
mmhmm
mm
oh
oh
mm
that's long
mm maybe you you remember that we talked about the swabber he didn't want to try that I mean it's a risk job but at least it's paying uh well
mm
oh
mmhmm
mm
I think remember just now we also spoke about the swabbers right
then um my friend went for a swab test and apparently
they have a lot of um what is a holding area for for them to do swabbing test
then
I see a lot of them so I think most of them are you know they took up that job to just to
to
survive lah on a monthly basis
it's not an easy job I must say because you never know who
who you encounter with
especially when
you are so exposed to COVID
and then you never know if the person that you are doing swabbing is actually
um having that symptom of COVID nineteen
there are maybe other jobs that community centres give
and then can also go to skill futures
to seek help
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
you know the other day I heard another friend of mine so about india so india actually came out with a vaccine
but unfortunately when they tried on a person the person went blind and paralysed I'm not so sure how true is the story but if it's true it's quite scary because you really don't know
what kind of vaccine will actually work
for the majority
scary kan
mmhmm
ya
mm prata
ya ya ya that is my favourite too should we go there
mm
ah okay eh that's the shop so come let's take a seat now
okay so I want
um
two prata

ah
mm
orh
oh
maybe I want one
teh peng
no teh with milk and ice
why but it's so hot now I need cold drink to make me feel fresher
ah
okay lah then I take one mineral water

orh

eh they have this food app that you can order online maybe you can order and then we just sit down and then they will send us the food

mm
okay so you ordering or I order

so people like us cannot cannot set up like cannot help
mmhmm
oh
lah
mm
mm mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
ya that's true
cause I think at their age the more they want to be
mm mmhmm
mm
ya
mm
you was hoping that your parents or any elderly will know how to use um handphone because that is the only communication that you can use especially when you really want to see the other person because but unfortunately most of um our parents doesn't know how to use it lah
mmhmm
mm
though
mm
then
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mm mm
mm mm
mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
I mean shiok lor
free lah to do whatever they want but of course within that eight person limit
mm
mm
ya
eh
oh
oh
mm
mm
oh social distancing ambassador
mm
uh huh
oh
mm
mm
mm
mm oh
mm ah
uh huh
mm

okay
especially during
you will your transitioning from a civilian into a soldier and then like
you have to throw everything away and then like you lost your rhythm ah
so ya and then like
okay lah they teach you a lot about like
ah regimentation and discipline which you are really not use to
it's miserable lah everytime I'm working right ya
so you have anything that like interesting you want to ask
ah that's what I used to think lah because
when I when I became a recruit at tekong I thought it's going to be the hardest part of my life ah
but honestly when
into inventory
is basically ah
it's like it's like way way way harder
is like times ten ah
like even though you got your privileges like you can keep your hair a bit
and then you are treated nicely what
no no
when I went to kranji camp into inventory unit right
so basically I'm treated well I'm treated better but the exercises are getting way harder
sly
is like
even even though you are treated fairly ah but the the exercises are even more like strenuous
ya
ya
ah basically you are treated like
like less than human ah
then
but not as often
ya way better ah but
I even though is hard right
is the I think once I right
I will really miss it ah all the achievement that I have right
ya it's like I didn't expect that
like I managed to go through it
ya
ya one year pass by what
is like I have a bear with it
so ya but I got a lot of achievements ah is something that I didn't expect that I can do
is like is really like
break your
your capabilities what you are capable of
ah
ya okay
okay so
basically my
achievement right okay
when I
before I the twenty four not much
from the first day we move up from five
and we finish the next day at two working with all the maximum load with all weapons and
and then I'm left with like
four kilometres left right to the marina float
cannot even feel my own legs ah
it's like
like is the most miserable thing ever
but the thing that makes you like really push on because you know that your family is going to see you
so I uh
and then like
you know that someone is waiting there
and then like and then the the fun thing is
and then I I let them um try on my bag ah my full pack
hmm all ah
all of them
and then like oo no I don't want to carry this again
and then okay lah that is that is twenty four K that is so big ah
and then
the another one is when I got my green beret
um
the send us out
to lim chu kang cemetery
at three three or two thirty
and then I was inside the bus looking out the window
I'm like oh my god S A F
who who who who who does things like these two come on and then is two until like
that same day eight we didn't even stop
ya and then at eight at night that is where they presented us our beret then like
wah shiok ah hmm
hmm
happy of course lah
if is like you will not just happy that we got the beret because we are happy with
I don't want to do that thing anymore that's why we are happy when we we are the most happiest when we are inside the civilian bus back to get camp
it's like aircon imagine in jungle
and then like soft cushioned your your transitioning from laying down on the soil
err
uh is that bad you know one of my friend who
you know about tekong water
the our water doesn't come from new water it comes from a reservoir from tekong
and the water have err certain minerals that is good for you
is very nature lah and then it's straight from the reservoir to the water cooler
and it taste it taste like ugh it taste so bad
and then there's this one point where during the confinement week my buddy the toh
ah you don't know err military term toh that means ah basically you pass out ah or you just fall out ah some sort like that
during exercise no no he just wasn't feeling well and he passed out on the first parade
so he was sent out
and then err he
and then in the few days he head back and then he ask me eh you want to taste singapore water or not
it's like
because that plain water is so nice
and tekong isn't the duh eh ya
oh eh ah
but okay lah
army life is
is fun but
you know you don't want to be a soldier ah
no it will get harder from here your your infant your inventory kan is
like you are
even even our
who's that guy's name our
brigade ah
wah so I forgot his name his position lah
ah
brigade ah you say
like is a dog's life ah inventory is just a dog's life
is is expected everyone like suffer
you to ask is the
one of the worst vocation to be in ah
because like
they say it's a singaporean son experience ah
ya
and then once you finish
uh six november
two thousand twenty one is still a long way to go
oh ya ya ya
you want to know ah okay so basically
err I want to
basically I'm going to be jobless for the first six months ah
and then um
I will be training my girlfriend
first six months ya ya because basically
I I want to do a portfolio ah
like if you um
take my
if you hire me as your coach ah
so ya I want to be like a trainer ah
the isn't isn't is not is
it's a future that is not promise to you
like if as if like you have a job when you have a job like all your promise like are going to get paid monthly just
you just follow orders and just do your your own stuff and then
but this one is like you are not confirm that you going to make it or not
so is very stressful
so it's like
it's like you're gambling you're gambling it away ah you gambling all your savings away ah
I like that's why I like trying to save up money for my after life
so ya
and I plan to also
compete
um
compete err
national like lah ah eh not national
err like
a classic
classic bodybuilding ah
and then like
why why would should I wasted I have been training for ten years
and I should make the experience worth it and then like complete
so everyone know who I am
what
yes of course
a'ah
how long will it take
for me to get the physique I really wanted
assure already competitions like ah showed any physic
after you only I can build back by six months
because
there's such thing as muscle memories since I lost my muscle to
so it's like I can build back everything or even better in six months
so like
handsome ah
okay
okay
um
um ya
okay
hmm
oh damn
okay but
sorry what
err
okay lah some sort lah
okay
um
so basically your
home based business ah
okay
means okay lah singaporean pursuit what
hmm
will I am black eyes peas
ah
will progress ah
ah
so if you are successful in your selling of clothes
hmm
no no no no no what I mean is
if your business is like a daily product progressively successful right
okay
hmm
hmm
hmm um
there will be any other platform that will take over what
ya but right now like facebook is killing it ah
like but there will be a day where facebook will die out and then other social media social media platform that will take over
tiktok tiktok
oh but no no I never use tiktok ah to me
ya
alah
why
ah but
the funny right is like
two out of ten eh
so is like two of them
or one sometimes is one one of them is funny and then another nine of them right you keep pressing
the tap the screen to skip when like nine of it is like you watch and then it's not funny at all then you waste you time
then
okay swipe up lah sorry lah that I saw people use tiktok right is basically like that after one thing they show another thing they show another thing and then like
and then like the first one is funny and then the other nine is not and then you are wasting your time I rather like use youtube because you can learn a lot from it
like what you want to learn about
like recently
I learnt about err
like photography and photoshop
so basically err after I
during the like
the stages where I'm trying to build my portfolio and
trying to get ready for competition right
err like
really like edit pictures really well photography like
quality studio near
quality ah
so it's like I get like followers ah
err it's like honestly eh
what I heard from my member as duh
come forward to tell like eh I'm training people people approach him so what if right you you're the person that give your service
and then ya can you imagine
no ya it's a good idea and then
ya ya
ya is like very popular
gym shark
hmm mm
ya lah yoga pants lah oo what lah shaker bottle
supplements before and
after is everywhere is like I'm literally everywhere and
to me
every account is very boring some of them like
there's instances where we have
where
it's it's about bodybuilding much he's funny
but
I want to make a instagram account where
where I want to show the world and hey bodybuilding is more than just a sport is a lifestyle and art
so when I take photos I would like take photos like as if
you know those seventies era black and white photos there's like
like like like really good looks like statue is artistic is like very artistic so that is what I want to do is I think is very different ah
ya
ya
that's why I want to buy a soft box
you know those ah
the basically like a umbrella and then there is a light bulb inside
and then the light bulb like really shines like
and then like so it's look like really good ah that's why I also want to buy new phone
eh S twenty is good ah
oh no to me
technology now kan
technology now is to the point where
it's so good especially phones
can be anything like what's the point of buying calculator and having inside your phone what's the point of having like
video camera when your phone is like
you also want to travel like
you don't want to
walk around with a backpack
with a your your and then another lands and then you have your phone and then you need to have a spare battery for your camera
so technology right now is like
is good ah how is progressing ah
ya ya mm S twenty plus ah
I I decided to buy a S twenty plus instead of S twenty ultra
photo focus issue
and then S twenty plus is the same performance as ultra so
so ya it cost only I think eight hundred plus
nine hundred
but
ya
just the phone itself
ya so get that phone ah I bet you like taking photos right
mm
okay
okay
okay ya ya you need like a
you need a phone camera that has
no just ask them any camera phones that
because
when customers look at your live right
and then use this the quality of the view and they see the hear the audio
if it's both good they're willing to stay
most of the time right like those new customers they won't stay in because they barely can hear them and the speaker the microphone is like
ya but you need to up your game ah
right when you think about it you need to up your game also like
what like your camera quality lah
ya
oh
um mm
okay
okay eh but if you plan to upgrade your phone right
then what type of phone do you want
this olympic athlete he is the
ya
kan
oh ya ya like if you have like like a premium
collection or what kan
there's like one clothes is like sixty dollars
then the shipping price is like worth it
can you imagine if the shipping price is higher than the actual dress people like huh why would I do that
why would I do that
okay
okay
okay
but
that means you need good lighting is not the camera
okay
don't use V S C O it's not good use photoshop
okay
mm
troublesome ah
photoshop you can get it for free
over time you'll get so good at it that you don't have to even think
mm
photoshop no lah you need you need that's why I told you is practice you ask a person let say into photography you ask ah
can you edit a
can you put my ear on my forehead
serious you just need practice
um
ya lah
I used to use photoshop ah once you know like how to do it
it's okay lah it's just arrange and repeat
okay okay lah then mm ya of course
mm
body shop eh
okay
ya is
what's going to be ah huh I can't wait I'm left with like one more year
oh man I can't wait
because after that I will finish my tech
you know you know wis a tech
a tech is basically the final exam so basically
um we go to war
with another company
the full of the company full of food just regulars like regular sign on
men
and
their life really
so is like you're fighting against people that really know the jungle
so ya and high chance that you will die
so and is quite quite long lah but what I heard is that whenever they say paradise now right
after like a tech right you know what's a paradise now
it means mission complete so when they say paradise now means
ah then you're done already ah
it's now it's paradise you have nothing to worry about them
the last two months of your right

when because
everytime everytime like
whenever he's he's trying to chase a girl

that that one you ah cannot blame your stupidity lah
because you you don't want to said it like I live at choa chu kang then I go back to balestier when there's a choa chu kang campus there ya lah
so I agree lah you agree to my statement ah thank you so much nurse nurse is see me
oo but college central is such a big school eh
once I went there to collect my award after like I graduated right
err my my my brain is like melted when I saw that school
why
um
that's why I love primary school it's so cute so small
and then like your class so near and then yay recess and then it's like what
or at least one minute away
at least I hate my poly life lah
they can that one campus there's like five canteen
and then every single canteen is far
and it's crowded the food is not nice is expensive
and then so stuffy
it's such a horrible school I hate singapore poly singapore poly is the worst school level
is
is I repeated one year because I'm just not interest
like to me right
is like progressing way better than poly well to me like one day like
one day like a diploma in polytechnic will be so obsolute
like I learn a lot from even though it's two years and my poly is like four years I retain a lot of knowledge when I was in
but back in poly ah it's just that I have to study this just to pass
that's the mentality of it so is not really a good school
and then like there's a lot of assignments so is like
you don't really have your own time lah outside ya
that is ya I have a diploma in electrical electronic engineering but
that you you I told you already that what I want to do after right
but that diploma is basically just to
is a backdrop career so like if at all else failed right
I have something lah
that I can
work lah but
honestly I don't want to ah I don't want to be electrical engineer
eh in in may seem like a electrical technician it may seem easy job but I don't want I don't it is just not me I just love bodybuilding that's it like I felt that I was born to body build
like when I was young right even before I started lifting weights when I see like heroes like arnold schwarzenegger at when I was like really young was like or inspired
that was like I was eight years old
and it's like
wah
there's a lot of foreign talent
like I want to stand out from the crowd
I want to be that guy
I don't want to be just a normal person
like is blended altogether in society I just want to stand out
ya
okay
oh ya ya
um ya right now singapore you are competing with foreign talents
because in the end wins right
um
P P
is like
why why why would you spend that amount of money on private
ya
those are those people who have like private diploma
once they get a job
you must really stick to the job for quite a long time
so like by the time move to the second job right people want to hire you based on your experience ya but initially is hard
that's why like why boasts about or within three months all our students got a job
that's what like to boost especially ya
the ya the banner
on top right
and then they always boast like that seventy percent of our students got a job within three months of graduating
mm
is it like your your challenging the students
it's very hard
ya but it's hard ya
because they don't know what they learn
because okay
when you go to
is a government you know government school eh let's say for example most everyone went to and they know what is taught there
but but your is different
ya
but is is NITEC
but why is it
I thought you only I thought you will just only saying this because of like
culinary jobs
sorry my mistakes
okay
um ya
singapore is quite messed up ah
this one the reason why a lot of citizens
feel like they don't belong in singapore
right
ya
ya but but singapore is good because it's such a safe place
that's the good but
singapore right I think it's progressing so fast
that people cannot keep up
can tolerate that way
look at
okay singapore progress in fifty years
in fifty plus years of third world country officiating port in the world like a first world country okay
you see ah
because we progress so fast ya ya but when you look at overseas right those people at of aged right they can use like
they are able to cope because their progressing slowly
like
when was america found it
like what year was it is more than a hundred years right
it's more than a hundred years but singapore you become third world to first world in like fifty years that is very fast people cannot keep up
see how stressful it is
it's like not a lot of people like
um
ya ya
but okay lah what
I think like
the next generation you won't feel so far
hopefully
stone aged stone aged ah like indonesia
ya ya ya eh
mm
okay
oo oh ya we do
okay
mm but singapore job is still a thing ah
cause requirement is to speak mandarin

I heard there's a lot of barber shop ah nowadays
ya but I saw it's like forty dollars what's so special about the forty dollars sia
but it's more I I don't know if actually I I I really cannot afford lah
got tattoo lah you know for normal people ah I will scared lah
ya
ya but normally
when I go there I sit down
ya but I normally go there only when I go reservist ya to make my hair short ah
ya

ya but during circuit circuit breaker what you do actually
ya
ya but I remember that time we always zoom
we zoom every I don't know once
one week I don't know three or four times sia we zoom
it's fun but I but I don't think we
ya is different ah I don't know ah to me is very weird ah
ya ya
ya I think we are lucky lah we got friends who are like
ya
ya
ya
wah but some countries more more strict ah I think
all this lockdown ah like europe ah like our friend ah our spanish friend
wah that one
but that one that one more worse you know they cannot even go out to have a job
oh ya they cannot go out have a job lah only and and they very control lah
sometime you can only go out for one hour go buy groceries then you come back
ya
oh ya ya
ya so

so it's all about you
want to
disrupt other people's family or what then you know their plans

then
eh then then okay then if example eh
then imagine if papa want to pass away then she then he have to pass down or whatever shit
if have to pass down to females we are the only two
I don't know
male female
then would you take it
if it if they have to pass down to female
then that means I have to take it
why
why can't you sacrifice for me
why can't you sacrifice for me
half half
no should take like
on
on even weeks
of the year follow me on odd weeks of the year follow you
ya
no but
I don't know
it's like we have to
that's what that's what my friend say also
because I like to go to these kind of places what
all the haunted places

all of us saw
and it was like literally like just
hung uh
hanging like
around me cause we were when I was sitting there at the porch
it's me and another two friend
no eh they were asking me black figure then I was like no like it's you can't blame me there's two other
people beside me and
out of out of like
three of them can see things
and one of them also I think the family also practise all these
ya
I because I also think back like
papa can get so many females swooning over him
that's why I was like
mm what so that's why I was like what's so attractive he's personality is like
not even that great
as in he's my dad but still like when when we visit him also you can see like this
ah
then like eh
I don't know
sometimes I feel like I want to go and ask
I feel like I just want to know whether I have something with me or not
eh no he got nine wives so so I you be ten then I'll be eleven
no the lina's cafe is not his it's one of his wives
I don't want to
number eleven is more prettier than me

okay then I need to change my voice already
I I need to change my looks too so people will take me seriously oh my god
I really want sia
ah
they will break your leg is it
did they break your leg
I know then after that she fall then after that just paralyse
stewardess
then she did become one
sia I don't want sia people don't take me seriously for my height also
they say eh you so mini
I I know right but I tend
that's why joe is the one that people would want to keep inside their pocket
she's like one lost child sia
won't
she wear heels also she won't even reach my height sia
but she don't care about her height ah
like I would feel so fucking insecure
that time me and
err
ray you know ray right
we were googling on
some of them works but uh the side effect is because they
your a high chance if you have cancer cells right the cancer cells will also accelerate
then you can
we never know if if the cancer is dominant
I want to be tall

wow mine is louder
K can
K ready
okay let's start
ah yes
ya lah we must tell them early so that they can plan
okay so what you want to go from morning until night
ya lah
ya so I think what we can do we don't go uh we don't go early in the morning like we can we can have a breakfast late
no not late breakfast we can have breakfast around woodlands first then we
ya ya
as usual lah we plan for the tickets
can speak in english
okay can
drive in ah
otherwise what you what you want to do over there for the
okay lah uh we can take the the voucher ah you want to buy the voucher ah meaning we have to go uh the
err
you have to go the four attraction
ya
of course ah
no lah the following week is the christmas ya
well definitely there will be a lot of people definitely
so if you want we can
then if you want to buy the voucher you have to buy before what just like the night safari
the four items ah the four D adventure then the luge the
I think the wax museum and one more I can't remember
yes yes correct
ya
err
think eleven plus ah
oh uh wait I know is until
nine or ten for the night luge ah seven plus to nine
two you uh ya the luge is two
two times
okay so the problem is the problem is if we take this one right
uh we will be
buying for
all five of us
but the luge you are not going what you and I not going right
so we are paying forty four dollars
four five of us
because the other three attractions we want to go lah
just the luge we don't want to go right
ya can also lah can
the three of them
but if affaf don't feel like taking another ride then can just pass it to the other two lah
then it's two two each
Subway
mm ya
but maybe at the beach a bit tough lah don't know ya
have to
is the camera uh waterproof
don't have ah
can
her studies finish already what her term finish already so she don't have
ya correct
so you just need
to make sure the other
err
affif I think he doesn't want to go down
eh what
twentieth right
the following week lah after christmas
can eh no cannot
yes uh uh
cannot
they can actually plan like for example we can go east coast
then we book a barbecue pit
don't have ah not open yet ah okay okay fine then just just go for picnic
and we split into two groups lah so the kids
all the children
add up uh
it's just nice
force lah
monday
that's why first person to check is aisyah
but if you I I don't know whether
err
going out is another option cause
okay so I suggest if you
then you ask her
then if she what he say lah you ask her for her opinion and all
get the ball rolling
since
so my family side I can suggest
uh ya lah there is a few suggestion lah one is
um we split into two groups
so one group is maybe uh
ya
go to the one that is more lah kan
you just want the cousins to meet only so just put the children there lah
so affif affaf shafie three
who which kids
ya because our children have to baby sit
and I think they don't mind lah because they haven't been
with their cousins
okay we have to ask them then
ya lah
but I think if it's like just cousins
then
you have how many uh eight plus four twelve
twelve children
they all together can play on whatever it is you know
he wants to host I think that's why I have to in it I mean we are brainstorming right now
cannot
yes
eight people can visit you
so if you're in the house eight people can come in
then they
K if it's a red line ah and it's too um
too loud
K
K so yes what what is it you said
sorry again
ah
amin I mean we all have been coming over
we ah mahir because the other time his family come over amin come over amin the whole family his whole family come over
okay do how ah
uh
ya lah uh we can give suggestions and then let them think
okay so we need to
ya we can suggest amin would you like to
host the kids then at least the cousins get to meet
uh at one time at one go
and then err
and then he is if he is okay with it then
then okay lah then after that
of course lah
they will have to be in the house
no once you are you step out of the house then that eight group
ah apply
just that maybe amin uh only
the two older eh umar also not sure whether he will join in
no I think they are okay with the cats it's just that I don't
know if umar is sporting enough to want to be left at
to be left at
at this house
you know what we haven't met them
for so long
K so
mm
right okay so what else ah do you want to talk about um
if we go outing how eight person meaning it's just our family
ya lah
very difficult
ya cannot one
the night safari
the only either way is just ask
our family of five
twenty
why
marina
the good thing about marina there is the wheelchair
or jewel
the
ya
we we also haven't gone what we don't know what it is
you don't like the kids like
ya
can have that kind of options lah so we we bring them over then we tell them okay you all go around with
schedule
no
so okay lah at least he knows his priority
ya okay the thing is if she go for the course that she likes
under northumbria they don't offer full time
they may or may not offer part time
but that's the one that she most likely will do well in
and it's something that she may one day want that one
no the problem is
all others in singapore lah unless you want her to go overseas
ya
kaplan is one ya
ya we have been to what
academy all those are ya they are all different
so she have gone to all
the only one that seems to be
something that she may enjoy is at
she have to go to the other place to the other places to see
um the problem with all other uh uni they don't
have the coursework
even if it's uh and her lecturer one whom she took the last course kan
then she the lecturer actually say um
that
a topic module not on in these two uni lah
your work is mainly the work that you do so you do you you do your work you present
and it is based on hundred percent what you submit
you have to write ah ah correct
so she's uh worried about the that part lah that's why
uh huh ya and I don't think she wants to do early childhood ya I know I know
ya lah
they actually have it leh the last time she say they the
so from what the persons have been talking
to the group
but northumbria if you want to take full time
the course that they offer is not what she wants ah
ya
course
they switch it to part time
so apparently I I suspect
err
mm more working people are opting for that course more working people tau meaning people who are
let's say they uh they want to do a studies part time so they opt for this course
okay problem with part time is that
if she sign up for a part time course
for us lah she uh or in the government's eye she is no longer a student
a full time student ah so she will be like considered as an adult already lah
so if she is a full time student
so in terms of say uh
err income tax then for us she's considered as one one child non non-working child
ah but actually that one not much lah
of course lah because she is ah
ya but then kaplan is private so they consider as
uh
ya lah
like that lah
actually I don't know whether has she tried out
the james james cook open uni and all that you know they have uh all these other
unis ah which
I think
this is bridging for kaplan
oh my god that's why I was
ya lah because when when we took up this program
at that point in time the
programme was offering so that's why it was like an okay let's do it
it's very frustrating lah
ya so that one actually I thought uh I want to sit down with her and go through all the
ya lah
ya correct correct so we ask her to arrange one day
where we can bring her to all the different places
explore wherever there is is it
all those things lah so and she went in they were all telling her oh you know uh this place is blah blah blah
okay the reason why we didn't go ahead with that
is because the university ranking is very much lower than northumbria
so because of that I was like affaf are you sure
new ones ya that's why that's why
either that or due to COVID everything stop uh
K so
we need another
ya we need another uh
round of her checking lah ya for her to check
ya
ya correct
then maybe malaysia okay
ya lah
that's what he wants to do
so
ya lah she
lah
you go into that
then there will be
ya but it's a skill-based lah so it's more about skills
maybe he might want to learn
more about how a camera works
so he's not just during photography photography but learning about lenses and all that
physics lah right that's physics right
so more about physics
ah so you learn how to make
the uh you learn what is the because
doing it he will
he wants to make sure that it's all correct you know
and it must be something that he wants if we tell him to do
ya lah you need to do your calculations has to be correct
your angles your whatever whatever right so those things are all things that he needs to be able to do
seems like it
okay
um
ya let's talk about SAM
I have an application uh by this person
who wants to uh uh okay because I put up uh a post
ah resale
ya okay so two ah one is about the
um recruitment
uh I put
teacher coach uh at SAM lah
so so far
uh
two person submit one is a malay girl who
the other one is an indian lady
used to teach english
so she uh she apply but we are maths kan so she apply so I was like
maybe I can so if if let's say we are continuing
then maybe we should already consider opening for english
ah that's why yes ya ya I think is under one
ya so I will tell because
because uh we already signed up what it's for free at that point in time lah
uh when we agree to do it
so I thought
if let's say uh this in I haven't contact
I haven't I haven't contacted this
samuel I haven't contacted the indian lady who submitted her resume
uh about it but I will explore because if she is interested to teach english
then
I have to write a letter to all parents this thursday
we are considering to offer
ah
switch her lah
ya
ya lah paying the teacher only
correct lah
so okay lah so what I'll do next is first ask samuel
about the
the fees franchise fees and then second we ask the
um a teacher
no you ask the the students the parents
and then ask the teacher
what's wrong
oh my god
okay back to what was what was what I was saying
english and maths
ya
the chinese boy
ya
so I just
okay
the thing is if let's say we can continue to get the numbers
and then let's say this teacher come in
can run ah let it run ah
so the partnership confirm don't want ah so I will message to say don't want ah
ya okay
ya
take all
ya
ya lah the good thing is like people just
come and just sign up you know without having to go for the diagnostic
ah
because we also you know even no matter what also we still have to let the child start at the correct year
the worksheets for P three right ah
so let the fella do that while the rest of them are doing their corrections then
continue lah from there kan
okay so
progress report I told ira to do that already
ah the letter I have to do I have to do the latter
that's what you said to ira right you ask her to do it through WhatsApp
in front of ira you said to ira directly
I was there so I think it's okay lah let her settle that portion
so we don't have to figure those portion out lah
but I think more important is the the letter to all parents
can't be bothered to
and then we message the parents we have passed the
but we give the hard copy so it's a it's a proof you see otherwise
july right we're supposed to give uh first week july then we didn't give
so this one at least we give lah everybody so everyone gets to see
everyone will know what it is
but that's for six months only right
ya lor
but then
buy over then he buy over lah
whether he can get people or not then he said
okay he what he said is
after going for the franchise talk
with Kumon which is similar to what
SAM say for
samuel say for SAM
then it is better for him
uh for uh the person who takes over is a full time
owner
tau so he was saying
it cannot be just he run and then he just close one eye and move on
he still have to be very much involved lah
uh in
ya sort of like that lah ya correct
but I was thinking actually no lah uh yang was thinking of
employing someone
to do the marketing to talk and all that russell is very interested he wants to do that
he messaged me again to ask
how the full time would you what what are you offering and all that
because his his photo looks clean cut lah so I think he can
ya lah he cannot speak the funny thing is okay I asked him so you can't you can't speak chinese at all mandarin you can't speak mandarin at all
then he say no I can't can you then I I said lah a bit
you know I said uh uh in in chinese a little bit then he laugh then he say
it cannot ah then I say during and all ya ya ya
uh I'm a bit I can speak a bit of malay a bit only ah I can understand a bit but
uh chinese not at all
then he ask why is it important I say oh because
uh nearby our place uh it this in this location there is a
international school GEMS international school
so uh a lot of uh
uh
are staying around our area and sending the child at that international school
ah
then then uh because of that
um we do need someone who can converse in mandarin because when the parents come to sign up
they cannot speak english and they don't understand
so when we are trying to speak to them it's very difficult so you know what he say
oh okay okay but now got Google translate what
can just uh tape and then listen and then we talk and then translate then let them hear lah
then I look at him
it's not accurate right then he say ya ya I know
ya
then he say oh but the children can speak english what so the children can explain I say yes
um we have done that
ya but I think parents want to hear directly from the teachers from the from the space
the place so it's not going to be easy
then even like the last time we had uh chinese teacher right who speak to them
also still it wasn't
wasn't that easy lah
so okay so he was trying to convince me nevermind nevermind got the app I think we can we can work around it
then I just oh okay
ah ah
ah that's why he said if you are paying him thirty dollars
for only two and a half hour he don't want
because he said the travelling the parking all is not worth it
correct lah ya so for him it is not worth it
so that's why he say if it is thirty dollars for two and a half hour he don't want
but if it is for four hours four thirty to eight thirty yes he will take it up
for thirty dollars yes
so he only wants it if it is four hours
then actually he is in insurance line so he used to be uh with Prudential
then he say he has a team he leads the team so on and so forth for a few years already
then he say there's some changes so that's why he stopped Prudential he move over to
uh uh he's a graduate
ah
so he was working
uh but it was only for a few months and then COVID
last to come it first to go
sorry
ya he's singaporean ya
oh okay okay and just and okay
so
maybe lah
but he and he has mild dyslexia
so he said he he had difficulty
correct that's why he wants a full time
he looks like he is the type that's why I told him I like to use things and all that so he was like oh okay okay then I say about the training so he's also okay one thing is that you do is
then I say about the training so he's also okay
okay so that's why this this chinese boy that we are seeing tomorrow
he
seems to be a better uh candidate he's currently doing degree in maths
or engineering one of those
ah so
then he was sharing in his resume
that he used to fail maths in primary school or something like that so he used to
err do badly at one point in time and then he overcome it
and then he can do well uh and and starts in his course lah so he was saying
he understand children uh who have difficulty in maths lah he can he can relate so he knows uh
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya lah
ya lah so no matter what at the end of the day I still need to be with them
to see how they do like what you said lah give them maybe one month to try
if good enough then we can continue if not
ya
the fit lah sometimes it's not a good fit
like sometimes some of your your method
is more suited for a big classroom you in front of the class
ya
ya
ya K lah can we will
tell that to the
to the boy tomorrow

when was that that you went to
ah that one her business just started on February seh
she went down to the shop she saw her husband
ya she talked to to ah the person lah the Aminah but she never talked to the husband lah
ya she was there
no she only have seventy dollars like what
I mean but but we are so lucky that we are we never take a lot lah eh
ours is below three hundred so she can refund us on the spot for two hundred sixty
but then again I don't know I until when she's gonna do this cause
at one point she wouldn't have enough money to pay that person and then this thing would be big
mm
three weeks yup three weeks before us this week is fourth week ah fourth month uh fourth week
mmhmm
oh in fact she mmhmm
ya ya true
then suddenly become her husband delivery friend whatever
but when ya when she when she messaged the supplier the direct Thai supplier cause she is the one who gave Aminah Muslim this number the contact lah so
that's why
kan so she is going to go babe this kind of thing eh once you do this kind of thing eh maybe you get shiok with it ah you get carried away with this scam kan but the you still can pay is okay you know but once you cannot pay ah that's it your name will be viral all over the social media I'm telling you honestly
kan
mm oh really
where you saw outside or
mmhmm
she selling at twenty two dollars or something like that if I'm not wrong
but but but then again uh they take from the same supplier the one that I order lah
ya that's the thing
I think you gonna like it
also not sellable
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm baby will be sending on Thursday night is it
and then this one I want to ask her to give me the orders by by tomorrow lah actually she already give ah later lah this wholesale lah I don't know she want or not
then Thursday she have to transfer to me
ah ya but Su Muhammad
ya like like real like that ah
mmhmm like ours ah like the ruffle dress I thought that would be a hit but then the ruffle dress is the most difficult to sell actually
kan
mmhmm no the side the mermaid part
but it's very very hard to sell lah I don't know why
ah like like ya
ah yes yes like Natalie Bella you see Natalie Bella she's selling the same stuff and then she put on influencer you know what I mean
so ya I think we need to invest lah but then again I don't see lah we don't need to take a lot of stocks lah anyway for me lah eh I don't really
mmhmm
yes
true
defects
they will ask for a refund
and you know to to to run the shop
but if to to be in a shop everyday I don't think I'm looking forward to that cause that's not where I see myself as unless maybe I don't know my my son and daughter grow up
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm I did a flea market before
no
perfume
mmhmm
ya looks like it ah
mm
open and then clear ya it's just like our live lah sometimes I don't want to open this you know but then I have to open it
mm
ya
ya the man ya
ya but ya I think but once in a while maybe once a month can do this flea market stuff but not like every week you have to do this flea market I'm not into that looking forward to any like you know every week I have to go to a flea market cause for me is much more on you know home-based I don't know I mean some people have big dreams lah but I I don't see I don't know how about you
ya I mean I I love to go to a flea market but but then again like you said setup and cleaning up and then manpower I mean you have to have manpower for it lah
which is mmhmm
mm
mm
ya about nine
ya you know like the event in the make up you know like the what last time they always have this exhibition all lah what is it called
what is it ah expo expo all these eh bazaar is it a mini bazaar oh my god I I I I've been seeing I did a bazaar before ah last time I was working in the bazaar ramadan
making bubble tea eh
when I was a teenager I still remember that that bubble tea was a new craze you know that time I was in
sec three or sec four lah that time
and it's very tiring seh it's very tiring oh my gosh
mmhmm boss
mm some more we will have to think of the money
ya true
so
mm
I think I think
ya rather than you have some live you see they have to go to the shop as well cause they have a shop so they do it in a shop so like I said I'm not looking I don't know maybe in ten years time maybe I don't know like what I'm doing right now is just for a supplementary to my income
ah she wants to quit her job yes
alright then after that seeing that art seeing that people can actually sell the dress then she suddenly twisted her her mind again fickle-mindedly wanted to sell dress again
mm
she offered she offered but I don't want

botanical garden
ya
ya
ya it is
ya it's err very bare minimum nothing really to see a lot we don't get to see alter we only get to see the model
ya
and it's moving definitely that's why I'm like away from me just in case
when the moment you say that what if it's gonna jump I'm like oh god okay I'm gonna back off girl back off now
you
damn
oh my god they can
oh damn damn
ya I think I was very young let me see primary school then we went to the zoo that was very small also so when I look at it the alligator like the biggest thing I've seen in the tank like super huge to me
I was like fuck this is like what a dinosaur alligator or what
ya and I will most like lead my way towards where they gonna feed the crocodile cause I didn't know that is like a way for the for the rangers rather than for the people
and then they have to shout like come down what you doing there come back now oh there's where we feeding the alligator come down oh no cause I was like run back down
mengheadache
err
chey
hmm
like
it's very nice to see elderly people going around and walk
I think botanical garden is known as like we had in our adventures in pulau ubin or macritchie because it's really a trail walk
narrow and and like there's only one or two people can squeeze in you know one walkway
ah there's crazy monkey out there so be careful they were fighting and I almost like strangle around cause I was still scared
I was like grabbing her neck I didn't realise that just crazy
she is gonna be conjuring two
ya that's crazy
ya
mm
I'm in a mess I'm in panic mode
ya so
I just
so one day when she's going to macritchie I got slapped on my face by a monkey so ya
but not the older one
you have a lot of acts a lot of emotion has developed
and they're trying to steal your bottles you don't bring any food or drinks you know
pulau ubin
ya
the mangrove
monkeys ya
no eh
uh oh no
hop on her bag
ya
ya
bottle cap
because he's very sneaky you know I assume it's a he lah I don't see the bird bird or what you know
they were on the rail bridge and then the monkey look at me
so I'm just going to like okay I just shut up let him do his business so the monkey go and took the bottle water away
mmhmm
okay
alright
oh
mmhmm
mmhmm
what the heck
okay
alright
oh
oh my god
oh my god
ah ya ya ya
mm mm mmhmm
it's crazy
oh my god
oh my god
what do you do
wah this teacher scold
ya lah
mm
mmhmm
mm mm mm mm mm mm
ears
okay
uh huh
ah
mm mm
uh huh uh huh
to whack ah uh
oi
ya
ya
it's crazy you know
it's crazy offended by animals and talking about animal I don't really like we'll never in my life going to feed the ostrich
the beak is like
really ah
I went I went ostrich farm
then
ah
they don't really like um sharp
you feel like painful or what
that must be a gentle ostrich K the one I went is a malaysia ostrich
and the baby like bathing the babies
but we don't really get the kangaroo to
come and
is it birds
I like the ducks
well ya man when are we gonna travel back
uh huh
nowhere nowhere travel
so that's why they got a cruise or either an airplane by
there's a
you can hop in to nowhere mainly just around the singapore
but there is a waste to do that so I rather do staycation which I'm still reconsidering whether it's worth it or not
staycay we've been doing that in now we can't go there at all
I was
ya
for the living room gonna have leh
ya
don't have to go far
ya but but do you think that
once it's reopened do you think it's safe for singaporean to go
what's your thought
that's one
mmhmm
oh
that's gonna take a longest time
that's dangerous ah
now cause
oh my god that's crazy and there was like towards the last before it closes down
that's crazy
I hope that
oh what do you think what happen if you decided to stay rather than come back
but
you get on board and come back in time
twelve sia
just crucial
ya
you know like how disruptive their businesses is having not singaporean coming for them like from their transportation taxis and what else ah food err shopping outlets whatever the business there is like damn affected of not us coming there
so when you come back I think I felt that where they will last to settle in but on the same time I felt that fight of crime might be higher
thirst and gone hunger for
months without good you know
food on the table or what you know and
ya so they might wanna do something a little bit more negative
you just waiting for chances
ya
mm
mmhmm
they have the
assertion
two weeks
mm higher
it's actually it's been like one month or two I didn't really keep track of what's happening about COVID
it's getting vary and
I don't know lah what else to track like when for me it's like when is this thing will be over
ya
the was ah
the worst pandemic
and I can't believe that that that stupid orange hair go and go and got himself lah he got COVID and then cured after few days the hell
hospitalised
ya
kan
ah
uh huh
same ya
phase two
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think the annoying part is like okay ah aside from business lah like how the work function now is
so um
thing should become a bit a bit more different or low expectation
okay like I know we can be a bit more creative about working on things but on the same time shouldn't expect much about how many gonna be anticipate on this cause it's the time that everyone gonna go be chaos
and you know like those especially the loose of job or even if they have job is like a better stay or stick around the job you know I'm gonna do properly
so people are no more playing around you know and and they will likely prioritise your commitment ah rather than other things
so ya I think certain thing you have to be a bit more flexible lah
both
ya so I don't mind like working
few days and four days at home or vice versa
I mean only some maybe that requires for you to be there physically
ya of course err because of your work function ah but other than that if there's not a need then I felt that work from home is the best way to go
ya
it's the worst thing what happen
ya but if you work in
semi government or what maybe a bit more strict
like if you
if you are really needed in the office you just have to come back in the office oh
it depends on your work already mah
ya
ya
mm
yup
ya
ya especially I think weddings ah weddings most affected ah
a batches
ya so we got our friend wedding coming up in november
err but eventually I think we they she have to be very selective lah who to invite you know you can't even like if invite those in couples or family those with kids no longer you just if you know the person one person and you just invite at one person ah that kind of thing ah but also she can't be very
restrict lah about two who would potentially can be invited
um
it's just err sad lah didn't get the chance to see that's all about it ya other than that of course we gonna wish everything is the best
cause it's who doesn't want to have like you know like at a dream wedding
mm mm
mmhmm
mm
mm mm
yup
mmhmm
ya
um hmm
ya must come to terms lah
so I think in this pandemic is not a good time to get married
because it's chaos
really
ya man things are harder during pandemic what else was affected
the the the fact that I also like after I climb the stairs then afterwards I feel out of breath wearing the mask
ya have to
you know you're like
and then like the air at the air is like in your mouth eh it's not breathing out
ya
I see so so the elderly like most affected to it so they'd rather stay home and when they stay home too long also it's problem cause they don't really being active outside
mentally also so they always I think now they gone crazy with social media and Facebook Instagram all this or YouTube
it's the best thing for them lah
social media the next thing ah
so I think they are becoming like the oldest millennial
millennial like a little bit too late but it's getting there for for not a good reason
ya in their fifties and nineteen forty seven
I'm like fifty something ya and then now they started to like uploading things on Facebook try to get to know the the the rad the world of online it's madness
kan but okay what do you what do you what do they normally watch
old songs
me watch
uh huh
me watch is not really friendly user I felt like you you know you must know lah a lot of scrolling ah I felt
they can still not not bad
ya talk about dad my dad is crazy with hindustan
so he's been watching an app
hindustan movies my mum like crazy about the whatever is happening in indonesian so she almost know every celebrity in indonesia itself and talk about their lives this one split lah this one got new babies lah this one wah she can tell me the whole story

that's it lah
maybe err
sheikh haikel lah
maybe sheikh haikel music and maybe some
actually not really ah singapore band not singapore don't have
much
the malay group
ya
overseas the jam lah but those those err there's a few there's few groups those few groups that they did perform in singapore there is usually about one or two song but
not really that famous you know I have a few few friends that they they make
something along that line lah so they play at the you know the youth park
at behind orchard road there so they play at the youth park and then they
they jam one or two or three songs and then after that
that's it then that's their limelight lah
after that
most probably they just go back to their normal job lah
so they are not that famous lah
but
err but ya lah I mean
unlike those in america or maybe I don't know europe they usually they usually put the put at lot
mmhmm
ya lah the
but it was mostly malay songs lah malay songs
mm ya lah she's more more of a
like theatre
like those you know voice not not really a band kind
ya
ah fazil
nuradi is it nuradi
mm
huh who
uh not too sure
talent train ah
mm
ya
our our comedian the the malay comedian are okay lah but not too
not fantastic but I I sometimes they they can be funny but I think
err the jokes are more for singapore centric lah not
not really not really you know malaysia because I see that some of the malaysian jokes are
ya script okay it's not spontaneous but the thing is some no some of some some of the jokes also are really are really you know you can see that eh maybe singaporeans understand but malaysian they don't really understand
some of the linguistic they say
mm
mmhmm
ya lah I I mean because they are more exposed
most of the singaporean singaporean comedian they are not exposed or they they have expose but
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ya and then they no lah they I think they they have training they have been doing it so
ya lah but you don't you don't do it one you do it maybe once in a once in a few months what
so you can't but for them they have been training this
I think they just go into their mode you know they can just do it
the talent show singapore idol
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh the voice ah sometimes like the voice lah
ya ah
ya
no lah the it's a draw what it's a draw
mm
ya lah I mean I mean he was trying to find
the what he wants to do in life I guess
ya but now look at him again ah where is he
after that that that competition can you
is he in any other the talent show or judge or see he's disappeared again
so then you mean what he wants to join competition every two or three years then no point also what
they should start singing or get album I don't know you know
zoe tay is from my alma mater eh she was from yuan ching secondary
no she was way way way much my senior lah but
it's like the school very proud of her lah
yes of course
yuan ching
she wouldn't err declare
err she you know fanfare ah because yuan ching is not really that you know famous school unless you know she's from raffles junior college or what ah then then she'll flaunt it
yuan ching
yuan ching ya
I wanted to go but you you don't
amin
but now COVID don't have already lah
ya we'll it'll be nice to go back to old school most of the teachers are no more there already lah
think that's like right what
twenty years twenty years ago
no lah most of them are retired already
I think somebody which
he's a bit a bit bald
eh ya
you know they are already old
most of them are in their sixties right
ya
why I mean that's natural progression lah I mean
they they have to retire what once they they hit their sixties
have the energy lah
professorship
ya lah I mean at that age you still have to keep up keep up with all this new generation of kids
ya the what now now gen Z already know now no more millennials
millennials are already hitting twenty seven years old means
yes
yes I'm millennial ah
nineteen eighty one is millennial start
so I'm like the first batch lah
ah
ah ah
even my brother is millennial
my brother naz
so naz is is considered millennial and me so we are within the one generation lah
no she she got uh she got an asset
but the thing is maybe is not a good time to sell so
so the asset is consider a lot lah but
but if she can if she can you know err ride through this
this time this bad time then if the property appreciate
ya lah but that one is that one is her finance
she did make some calculation lah I mean there is some days and so on
but the thing is she definitely made made err
make a profit lah but the thing is if she
ya lah about one point one million lah but
she can still make money like cause I think now property
mm
how much she bought it
but her one is at simei right
during that time
you can get that that kind of house for
nine hundred thousand uh
thirteen years ago
mm
oh
oh okay
I thought you she said she liked cycling
then
how how how old is the
how old is the property
so she buy second hand lah
huh
so just just
uh amber road
ah
you said just start paying so it means that
the the condo just
so she bought it second hand
at this time maybe she's
she get a good deal lah because err
oh so new lah
well that's a risk
development
mmhmm
ya lah
mm
ya lah
but her place second floor
what one point
oh
her main bedroom
oh cause so it's quite big lah
ya okay but
uh huh
okay
but why she why she lives in a condo
dasha when she can save more money right
mmhmm
ya but it's it's expensive I think rent rental for
how many people
because if it's a three bedroom she I doubt I doubt she share
her bedroom with another person what
right so still
so the the rent can be as high as thousand five
so that doesn't make sense thousand five
she can get a or full
three room
mm
mm ah
I mean actually
ya true but I mean you can always travel you can always travel take bus take train
ya I so it doesn't make I mean it just you can save more what if you go go on the outskirt
if he is sponsored
unless he's sponsored lah then if sponsored is a different story sponsored means err in the embassy one is paying for her living space eh if it doesn't then
it doesn't make sense to
ya
I mean now okay lah maybe now times are bad a bit difficult but they should be savvy right they should they come all the way from from russia to singapore
to earn money she
ya lah but
ya but she's spending on the she's spending on the luxury uh apartment
like you know it doesn't make sense what
two of them in the room
okay
okay nevermind
for six people lah
say about thousand plus ah ya maybe ah
okay
if six person ya lah if let's say the rent is five thousand divide by six and ya lah make sense lah
but then still expensive
ya maybe they want privacy lah one thing about condo is that they can have their privacy err is a bit difficult to have that privacy especially if you're russian and if you're not a local you don't look chinese you don't look asian confirmed there's a lot of stare a lot of people
be talking about them not so ya lah I think that's one of the things that that they can get away when they have
they live in condo lah so that
they are being sheltered lah
fixed condo
ah
ah
ya lah ya lah
mm mm ya
ya
ya social social class
and then how ya and how they how they uh being brought up so they a different kind of
mindset and
a different kind of thinking
so but err when they are young
it can you can see the vast difference ah cause
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya they they they have the advantage I mean you have to see that they do have advantage they have the resources they have resources
because sometimes
ya but sometimes they need the drive sometimes sometimes err what drives what drives people
mm
okay
ya but travel agent company last time yes they they do make a lot of profit
but nowadays is very difficult because there's a lot of disruption
disruption to the to the travel industry then people book
err flights all by themselves hotel by themselves
tours now even even like expedia
they have they have their own you know experience
mmhmm
how much
ya that's quite a lot
oh eh so he's the degree lah
during degree his taking tuition when his have doing his degree
uh huh
oh okay
mmhmm
okay
uh huh
eton what's a eton
for who what what
so it's in not in not in singapore lah
oh
depend on the area lah depend on the area if if they if you ask the vietnamese leh
he's err he knows err he was
he study certain in ukraine so he speak russian so he learned russian a lot of vietnamese err they they have influence
by russian so so it depends on the area lah maybe singapore because we are called colonized by by the british and the so we have that the influence ah
mm
huh russia
but is it recognized or not in singapore
uh huh
but then how do they convert
how do they how do they convert how do they convert the
the no the what
oh malaysian malaysia hospital lah
oh okay and then then okay lah
ah

oh
oh okay
eh oh err rundy rundy
rundy rundy
uh ireland or scotland ah
ya
one of the
ya so
I think that one cost cost them about four hundred thousand ah
four hundred thousand
mm
ya
mm
ya most I suggest
he just got promoted to become a a principal or deputy principal
so after like wait ah can remain thirteen fourteen
most of my friends
in singapore
mm
I think the highest I heard is jer lah
so not not easy
but in in in
but I think
not much competition or either that or they are more
laidback ah
uh
ya
no it'll be different but ya
so
if the children
if the children want to go
aboard to study ya
that will be some challenge ah
uh huh
ah ah
uh huh
I think ya lah because the the guys are not
no no the the
err secular
so that that's why he I think he took chemical engineering or something like that
so so he he kind of like you know engineering so there's a lot of option in singapore
for the girls they
they're they're
ah because they think because they take the A level right like what we did mention right cause there's no science there's no
in A level so they take the languages
so in uni they're being offered
literature they are being offered
languages right which which ah no so so socio sociology right
sociology social sciences ah
ya so the thing is the options are limited so that's why they they they think they're going to
for overseas means they have more option so that's why they take the overseas option
jordan

really high
uh huh
mmhmm
mm
I
no I was I was
okay nice
thank you bye bye

wish eh
then for you
three months
oh like how is it
twice a week
ah not bad lah
oh you met the the mum
okay
ya lah
uh
mm
eh
right
oh okay is he the youngest
second child
same as you ah
but you guys haven't fought right okay lah
cause they say like you know
but I'm not sure if like they'll be a
oh
I think it will take a while lah
one year
K lah
um I think one year okay maybe six months ah
but then also it depends on how much you see each other
so if you see each other twice a week then ya maybe one year
like
right ya so he is
ya
like but why did he choose electrical engineering then
mm
mm so
mm
mm
mm
oh
probably horrible for him
ya so I think
but does he know what he want to do
mm
mm mm
mm
ya difficult is difficult but digipen is like quite renowned ya it's really it's very renowned
mm
ya I mean take a risk ah if you fail then
it's okay then go electrical engineering
kan I mean that's what I would do lah
then um okay but he's in which uni again
okay so I don't know whether
has any of that kind of ah
degrees ya so if he wants to like
transfer to a different course in he has to think properly lah what kind of course he wants cause like
mm
ya
but you want to go uni right actually you were saying that time
but where do you want to go
what
oh okay okay
there's a master's in uh lasalle
uh err east asian studies
like completely like go through masters and everything ya you know like
I think that it's okay lah like
cause if you just study jer kan
then you still remember how to study and still remember how to like
ya so it's it's it's it's not easy ah
but like wait like you graduated in diploma
mm
mm mm mm
okay two years ah
when
ya
don't stress
but what I can tell you is like
sleep like whenever I want
and and things like that lah I do pretty much almost whatever I want now
so I think that's one thing that
is good
ya
so
ya I think ya good planning if you want to do it after your
if you have to do it like after your um
ya but you don't know when you wanna get married yet ah
but for you
mm
uh
ya and then if you are getting married at the non COVID
period
ya it's super like expensive kan then you have to like you have to think about how many people you wanna invite
and who you're gonna invite and everything
so like you have to prepare ah
oh
ya it is it is or a park you know I mean if you want to go for something cheap
tuas tuas
like the whole like solemnisation
serious
PayNow uh uh seh
clubhouse
okay
oh okay but it such a weird place lah to like get a get married at uh at tuas
ya I mean if you're up for pulau tekong kan
like I'm if you're if you're up for pulau tekong you're up for pretty much anywhere seh but I think you don't want sentosa right sentosa is too touristy for me
ya and you don't have to spend so much also
oh ya you just book the cruise lah you just get one cruise uh uh
then you get married in the on the water
uh
uh uh seh
like like go all out lah
ya but it's just going to be a halal party though
I mean like no alcohol and stuff
but I mean like are you gonna like invite your chinese friends you know
uh mocktail lah mocktail
like we get like a bartender that just does mocktail okay and orange juice apple juice sparkling wine
uh huh
oh nice ya we should go there I wanna go there
oh okay okay okay
mm
ya I know
okay so like what do you guys get
uh uh
brunch menu mm
mm
okay lah best lah
mm
mm
mm
then you barbecue yourself or what
oh K
oh K K ya lah like buffet lah then you can omelette like you can ask what kind you want
mm ya ya ya
eh but no barbecue pineapple is nice
oh
oh because barbecue pineapples are like they are like caramelised so they quite sweet and sour at the same time but they're not too sweet
if barbecued properly lah I don't know whether they barbecued them properly or what
aww it tasted like meat ya
mm
right I think ya we should go for like those staycations where we have buffets
right
ya like I I want to go on staycation but I don't know whether you guys want or not
ya like
even when it was um
during the COVID but it was it was okay it was fun ya
ya cause like there were so many things you can try ya and then like it's not just a place to sleep in
and they had the capsule coffee thing
but they had all the flavors I didn't like
take them afterwards after the first one
um
ah seh or you can go with us lah like me and uh me and hafiz so you as in
ya
I think they'll be fine wait is he like
quietness then maybe they will be they will like the serenity and the tranquilness
I think we will end up making fun of them the whole way
right or maybe we can get the boys also lah then at least there's some a bit of
mm
mm
then is school is probably just gonna require the gonna like resume right as per normal in january
and like
okay lah so it won't be any different
I want to go like staycation in will be nice
I mean ya if the COVID situation weren't like that lah obviously
really ah
like
how how bad is it
it is
they had like the music
err show and then he had he was positive but he wasn't wearing mask or anything right
mm
mm
uh
that's like unfortunate you know
ya cause
if like that then how are they gonna recover seh
like even
if they they recover like if johor is not gonna recover their
their economies going to suffer
to get back up
ya
if
ya like I think like
ya
mm
mm
ya
like from what it looks they are not
ya india is like one of the worst I think
kind of on purpose because india is an ageing population and their old people are not dying
uh uh
that's like some of the people that they are like talking about it lah
so if you have no chance of survivor then good luck ah ah cause like what what what's the point of me trying to save you if there's a higher chance of saving this other person
mm
ya
ya
uh uh
ya ya ya
mm
ya ya ya
ya you want to pay for my fine
ya exactly then is like and the thing is right we have this like culture where we do we can't talk back to them
ya that was ya that was the whole atmosphere of the whole bus
ya so it was in the bus
ya so that was like quite bad ah
ya
ya I was in the bus and I was sitting opposite him
ya ya
ah luck luckily like mm I alighted much like err quite fast lah so so I I like okay it's not so bad ya but like
in the place that I stay at got a lot of old people like that
uh
uh huh
ya
ya
mm
ya
uh
ya ya ya ya like the do not
sit uh
uh
uh huh
uh huh
mm
uh huh
mm
mm
okay
uh
okay
uh
uh and just be aunties lah
ya ya ya ya
mm mm
uh uh seh
uh uh
ya
mm
ah ya ya correct correct correct because we are so like oh my god so close to each other but because we are wearing mask even though we are very close to each other it's very hard to ah ya and then we already have the thing like myself if you will and what if you are having any flu like symptoms or what and then you try not
ya december twenty nineteen
mm
that's why then I'm like also like
ya
mm
mm
mm
mm how how their conditions were right
oh my god ya true
ya and I think people are actually like using their hand sanitisers and stuff I mean like at least now people are washing their hands
uh
uh
uh
mm
like I realise that ya because they they have to clean it more
ya so they had to go back in because it was so bad
ya so we are now living like normally pretty much ya so we have lot things to be grateful for I think
ya just that we can't like travel
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm cause it's not a law is it
cause it's not a law is it
okay it's not like singapore where where they have where we have like the ambassadors you know
ya I know right I mean we we just have to suck thumb suck thumb jer ah cause no choice kan ya but in the end we realise it's better that way actually
ya so I think that there is that needs to be some
order ah law and like you know some order in the country
if not it's really goes out of control ya
I heard japan also is quite bad it's going nuts are getting worse
and they had like a campaign to travel you know go to travel and then err some people made a a like sarcastic kind of err remark it's like err go to hospital
go to heaven ya this this one they say go to hospital because they found out like
uh
uh
that time ah
ya ya
ya
like for now because like when you eat and drink you don't really
like it's almost like normal
ya
ya
inconvenient and I don't think it's going to work anyway
like what my what this centre does some this centre that I go to
they have like the glass thing so it's like a circle it's a circle table but there and then there's four chairs but they have the glass thing so we can eat with other people but we they have the glass so we that it's like err you you don't you can't transmit anything lah so I think that's fine but if you're talking about wearing a mask to and and eating the same time I don't know how that's going to work seh
that's why I don't know what the prime minister is thinking even
like it became headline some more leh then I'm like oh my goodness
uh
this kind of like way to combat right uh uh it's like I read it I cannot forget seh then I keep telling people then people like
it it's already a bad situation as it is and then he's trying to make it even more ridiculous

okay we can start talking now ah so first thing first let's remember the ground rules when we talk we cannot overlap each other
I told her fairmont is cheaper fairmont is only three hundred dollars per night then might as well go there then you have a halal food there also
oh ya ya
I don't think it was part of the rediscover thing I don't know the whole list isn't out yet right
a condo snow city I can ask any of my ex colleague for your hair that you can go you for freely given got the shooting shooting why the laser tech tuition right
that one got the shooting shooting one paintball thingy ya
coming to december kan

oh
just to be safe ah
job finding not so good lah still finding hundred plus going to two hundred jobs already rejected funny thing even temporary job also they don't want what to do
then
ya my career futures is a lot of
mendaki have opening but that time they wanted someone with a degree of sociology
ya
it's good full time already now
true lah but okay lah
but it's okay lah crowne plaza now got staycation package mah next time he come over then you can stay staycation package use up the one hundred dollar voucher
mama wants to go for that actually
it was a couple of hundred
ya not worthy
ya and it's like when I look at the I watch videos of people who paid for it and go for it's like if you eat halal food you really waste your money because you are not gonna drink all the what dom perignon and all that
never let old people spend too much time on facebook and this is what happen
I was thinking of that too you know because dorm can cook mah mama can cook
but she eat ramen all that
cause the food nice mama is one of the few people I know who likes aeroplane food
no for me personally I the only airplane food that is nice is like the qatar flight that's it the rest
we had a question what is what was the most memorable meal you've had and where did you have it sad to say it was on the qatar flight I agree
really okay I should try

I think it's tanzania because of serengeti national park so that's tanzania but also can what because you just travel south kenya on top tanzania below mah I think I can take qatar then I will fly to qatar and then go down
there got flight
good lah I don't have qatar membership

ya ya ya
ya ya ya
the best ah
ya

currently I haven't get my letter lah but
um
err
like to push myself with my friends so
fit body more important for me lah over good looks but
err
if I had to pick one then
how about you
err
as long as we know diet properly we train hard like we can get we can get the the fit body lah but for good looks err if your face is a certain way then we we can't change it what so it's all down to genetics
err
err to fit body
err hopefully lah can you know live a healthier life and err not have any like
err
wah your question so deep
so
I I feel like maybe you know they always talk about the ice caps melting all this
ya
so
but if you look at other countries um a bit more difficult to control lah especially if the country is very big right and
err maybe they are more how to say like social like
could be a reason lah if let's say like scientists err cannot find the cure or like the vaccine in time
then I feel like
how about you what you think
you know from all this err
hunger and starvation maybe like
err people will like the population will eventually get reduced lah cause
um
if if this I mean don't know lah maybe if like this in the whole world not just africa lah of course other countries also you see the
mm ya ya
supernatural kind or it's like a realistic kind of like
oh
mm err
I mean
better like not say change myself lah but like err how to say like relate to them and like
err whenever I have my social interactions with people and all that I can
adapt accordingly lah
it takes a while a long time to to pick up and build up at until you are at a good level lah
then maybe another skill would be like
err
like the kind err it comes together with like
err performance because I also play the drums right then I have a band so
like um
err that kind I I hope like I can improve my confidence lah I mean is err it's not really a skill maybe is more of a trait but
err then
it's it's good lah in the long term it can help me in many many situations in life
is more towards um
like
err
because these are things that will appreciate in value and
you know I can I can just err accumulate my wealth from it because since like you said lah in the condition given is that
so like
err
increase my wealth from there lah whenever the stock market go up I can just err sell it if not I just hold on to it lah until the value is a good time to sell lah
ya
ya
for me ah probably
ability to teleport lah
it no matter how we try to maximise our time
like ultimately travelling takes a long a long time lah like
even then like
is is not a problem lah you can you can do it at your at your like your own time you save so much time and
like maybe their daily commute takes a total of four hours out of their day you know
like
if the ability to teleport I feel is a is a very good superpower lah I mean
maybe we don't see it much in movies like err maybe people like more of like a a strength or something like
but I feel like this is a small small little thing lah that
err would would benefit like
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mm
err
sometimes when you have like
I mean they always say lah with great power comes great responsibility kan so like
um
um
I feel like it's beneficial lah because like I can I can still live my life and stuff as as per normal
this err insane amount of strength that how hulk has
ya
mm
I mean
err I play a lot of sports and all that I love to gym you know
but
like
err whatever the case lah basically
whenever I am down then like or I am not able to perform at my
highest potential highest err performance lah
I
I feel like because of this label like I have to always like
they all look up to me as this err strong fit buff guy then
um
from a physique aspect like in terms of looks also like
these so called good label can be um
will come after you lah because it is like it puts a lot of like high pressure on yourself
is down lah like
ya
so when you go into the spiral then um
err just lay down in bed just like
like
um this this this good label of being this fit guy this strong guy buff guy good look ah like good like physical look
all err
they just err placed on me lah ya
okay lah
that's one but
um of course devote some portion of day to the person lah like
err partner
like
so
I mean
my my day will most likely be like
err going to work and all that then like
err I I still like to keep fit lah as I grow older so um
if possible
err
ideally if I can become like a private sports therapist then physiotherapist then I can help
err athletes who
who like because I was I'm now an athlete like
to help all all these athletes and ensure that they are able to perform at their
when it's fully recovered you can perform better you can push yourself or
it's a it's a thing lah I feel like
err
very very important to you know err commit yourself to the other person
of course it will include cost lah but you are you are willing to do
whatever it takes to maintain that relationship with the person lah so that would be that would be ideal for me lah ya
err ya then
I feel lah that would be ideal for me lah because it's something I really enjoy and it
err
ya
but
err more visible as a group
it should be it should be fine lah ya anyway like
like
your muscle will build up but
err
especially if it's like a a decently long ride lah
it takes time lah so like
ideally if my working hours not too long then I can squeeze these two in err
cycling gym and also like time for family and like
err girlfriend lah ya

hi taufik ya it's been great
ya
so what about you
mm
okay
I see

okay
right
okay so err found any new hobbies or you know like favourite activities ever since the COVID
really so you're into designs or like ya design things yourself
oh
okay like interior okay I see I see okay
that's interesting
ah
um as for me err
well you know like previously if you I I mean I I prefer to go out and and such but now that kind so I feel that err I've learnt to you know last time I don't appreciate um netflix or watching movies but now I learn to
um you know adapt myself to try to watch netflix or you know play games and all these kind of new hobbies activities that makes me feel like maybe closer at home ya which is very
err depends because they now play like some err netflix original you know like all the chick flicks so I'm and then some of them are horror I'm into horror also so ya
something new for me ya

for the seats
oh okay
okay interesting
okay
so um ya
mm what
is one thing that err can I ask err what is one thing that err really will make you feel annoyed like you what do you
ya
consider okay okay ya ya totally ya
okay
err ya of course I prefer err advanced planning so I don't like it when um err for me that that is also one thing that annoys me ya
err but it's okay to me things happen I'll try to be more understanding ya but the real thing that will make me feel um annoyed is when
err actually someone lied to me you know like um behind my back it's just really annoying
so um ya
err that's one thing that will make me
really angry
ya
yes
ya
okay
grow a lot older now we just err communicate through err
ah and then keep updates lah but then the the one that err I still err hang out with the most will be my secondary school friends also currently ya
how about yourself like are you still

my personality and my face okay but good err ya good guess good guess ya you are right ya um I'm into indo like indie music ya currently that's err
um over and over again especially during work working time or working hours or when I'm about to go to sleep that's the best time for me to listen to music ya ya
okay
ya I can see that okay
emotional so you can express your feelings through music
ya okay ya true
actually
orh okay not that gore loud kind of thing lah okay okay
oh okay
okay
orh okay
right okay okay
I I saw somewhere
small service
oh
uh huh
oh okay
ah
okay
mm

oh right okay
mm
mm okay okay
mm

wah actually uh time management
okay I
mm
you know like start err and plan is is kind of like difficult for me and to to to do a you know like trial
ya
ya
yes ya
ya right
ya and and
ya
yes ya so uh I mean twenty twenty eh to be honest has been such a tough err year for most of us like there's a lot of challenges but um this year is like um very interesting like something new for everyone so I'm just wondering about how next year
things will be like
ya
will that be your destination to your honeymoon consider lah okay
mm
okay
oh okay
okay
okay ya
ya new zealand new zealand
ya
cause I see like err
atmosphere so it it's nice you know ya can can consider for honeymoon
right
mm
okay
mm
oh okay so
correct
err I would love to err try out like the different kinds of
like um food but not I can see that my for my parents case they they are not open to try something new
our tastes ya
correct
ya
ya
you know she might not like it and she'll object to the place like for example I want to
ya so it's all
depends
correct
ya
okay previously kan err I was studying overseas kan so err it was such a
still prefer to um to the winter season
how about you do you like autumn spring spring
ya ya it's it's like
oh okay
ya
autumn okay
what's the point of you wearing in singapore but that's the only time you get to um
ya
next few trips ya hopefully hopefully
oh okay
ya
mm
okay
oh ya
okay
have you tried
bullet train okay okay
I see
but ya
but it's okay um
so maybe you can bring me you can be my tour guide tour guide
okay
but okay um
uh does it feel does it feel like do you feel like it's like an interview
I think I'm too used to err having formal conversation so it sounds like an interview to you sorry
err
secondly is the fear of height I I am not afraid to ride a roller coaster but then what makes me scared of it is like because it's quite high and then
um ya I just
ya I can still look through the window I still ya
okay
okay
mm ya
a new experience and I thought that I wouldn't be afraid or I won't like you know
err you know I won't be scared of it but apparently uh ya I was having a hard time so I didn't look down so I was like looking in front but
but how about um
I mean for you I mean what is your what do you fear actually
really you look you look like so manly
really
mm
a bee stung ah
oh okay
ah okay
sponge then you touch it is it
then
oh
did you shout
can you can you try to err you know like reenact I would love to see your expression
oh okay
went away ya
I I don't know the the name of the spider
hairy next so what kind of
ya ya ya oh no
speaking of spiders ya I
don't quite like insects also
yup so
that's interesting
mm
ya
so um
ya
carry err
okay okay
okay
you tried
oh
huh in thailand
okay
mmhmm
cocoon
okay mm
because err some people always say that okay obviously um the
err obviously is like um the the the insects that is sold um for you to like can be consumed they say that it's err clean but you know it's clean um
but I still find disgusting even though like um they say it's very crunchy ya ya but I'll even if someone were to um to offer me like maybe one hundred dollars or something to eat it I would still say no cause it's disgusting but I've actually witness a couple of friends who ate it in front of me and they said that it's it doesn't taste like
err you know it taste like some white crackers or it taste like chips or don't know what it's like very crispy crispy kind ya so it's like I wouldn't I wouldn't taste it ya
maybe like rats like rats for example
orh
ya
ya ya ya
oh ya maybe probably ya but um
very interesting to see like uh maybe you you know err like like even when um when when you see in in videos all the cambodians right when they cook something that is traditional is actually their dish but when I look at it it's kind of like
err is it clean you know like where do they get this from is it even you know like because eat literally anything everything ya so I just like okay
is it even safe but but you look at it they look like they have like a a um they don't have weak stomach you know like they can eat anything I think if I were to be there probably I cannot adapt to them kan the way they eat ya correct correct
ya so they basically um I think cambodia is also one of the countries that it's very hard to get um halal food because mostly err they eat like
yup okay
so I mean err
this is this is very interesting you know ya you know one thing that um I enjoy about having a conversation with you today it feels like we have err been jumping a lot of topics but it actually err
you know connects us our conversation to to speak err
ya and also because because you you are a introverted person you're always shy so this is like a way for me to ya usually when when we um when we we we talk is always on err whatsapp so now that I get to meet you and have a better conversation like I can see how you express
you know by your actions which is good I think we can err do it more like maybe in ya we we don't have
have to like just keep texting I guess it's very hard for me to see how you express
ya
um
any any other questions that you want ask me
because I know you are a very curious person kan so probably you might want to ask
oh so you have you have been eyeing on my phone you you've been peeping is it oh it isn't the latest lah the latest kan is iphone twelve so basically mine is like still eleven pro but it's not the max also okay err ya I mean err it's very expensive compared ya
ya right
more to the back
ya
oh okay okay
but how about other android phones I mean android can be like samsung um err like err nokia you know all these
sony okay sony is um
the music err have good quality
camera okay I'm not quite updated I've been an iphone user
okay
okay
that's that's uh that's good
oh ya I think um ya that's quite ya the downside of it lah I mean we we've been paying
quite a hassle because usually the normal kan but then ya

okay can start already
good I'm good
we
video call each other kan
was it my assignment
was it google meet facetime
zoom zoom eh
because the last time we met physically was like
before COVID kan
that was like
many many months seh
ya
so
err how have you been like I mean how's your work been
ah
so like err were you affected
I see
so like are you working from home now or what
mm
like
really be in office right
don't mention it man it's been damn crazy
you know right I I've been doing online right I've been on doing online learning so it's been
very tiring lah
because for me it's like online learning is
like the workload is increasing
so it's not like people say it's like alah online jer pe
ya
sitting in front of the laptop I don't think I don't think that's my ideal staying at home situation
like
I I feel like I've dreamt about this before but okay nevermind ya
so ya lah but now um it's it's going to be exam period soon and assignment period and stuff like that so
I'm just
trying to survive day by day but
ah ya lah ya lah I mean
I'm trying
ya true
I've been stress eating and I haven't been exercising that much
like
buying comfort food
and my comfort food is like not those healthy one please is like those what chocolate
mm liho
kan
eh but I've been doing this err one cardio tau
err this one channel
it's like this one guy instructor and one female instructor
they are couples like
I think husband and wife
so
then um
video
oh no I think
songs you know music so
to me
quite quite quite quite fun also
ah ah
because for me like
be consistent ah
I know I have to take care of my health but I don't really bother about this kind of thing until like you until like someone really fall sick or it's like a wake up call
ah ya
the pimple and stuff like that and then like you know
um
okay lah maybe I'm just lazy
ya
so it's not online learning it's just me
ya
or is it because you like this kind of
vibe
you know what
you should put like fairy lights man
the orangey type or the white one
you you still use it lah
oh
we met in err
primary school ah
wait
wait
so if we met serious primary three
oh my
so that means we'd be friends for like about twenty plus years
oh my
eh but actually kan
but actually
our friendship is like random
kan because I remember in secondary school we we weren't really contacting each other kan
close
yes then
wow you know I'm an introvert kan then
to to click with someone because she's an extrovert
and then like
ya
oh my god
I don't know what you are thinking but no that's not what I meant okay you and your you and your weird mind
alright whatever
okay lah okay lah let's not go that direction
oh about my boyfriend eh
okay lah okay ah I think
mm
I I don't remember I don't I don't recall if I told you about his condition cause
okay the okay err what was the last time that I told you about him eh do you remember
popping in his mouth so it was very painful for him
err eventually it didn't get better for him and he was very worried and then the fact that because kan he um because he's staying far away from family so his anxiety level is really really very high and
I was trying his best to be very supportive but at the same time I was also very tired because he wasn't trying to be positive as well
I mean I understand where where he's coming from but
to me if you're not trying to be positive about your condition
it's very difficult
kan so like um
his condition kind of worsen tau
from the throat to
technically like the whole part of him lah got worse
he
something wrong err there's something wrong with his kidney
so
for the for the for the appointment
ya but then
like he
he really drains me
not only mentally
throughout this whole um
so like
cause it's always been about his sickness
so like
mm ya
ya because
like
mm okay
okay actually kan that time he asked me tau
okay
okay this is very cliche but
like
like like like you said relationship
but
okay maybe it's also my fault for not healing properly
when I got to know this new guy
but
I don't know eh because you know my soft spot for my ex kan
and I hate the fact that he made me feel this way
you know sometimes I feel like
because just now I was talking to err my friend
that guy
ah like okay cause he was my best friend
so
you can be with
you can be yourself
you want to be with your best friend you know like you can talk about anything and he was that kind of person but because of my
my my temper my my my my mood
I shouldn't screwed up I shouldn't have screwed up my relationship with him
kan
actually kan to think of it I think he was like my only best friend tau
I mean you know during poly I had a lot I had a lot of guy friends
but I think he was like my only best friend
and
ya to lose him was like a double double hit seh double blow ah in a way because you lose your
best friend and you lose your boyfriend
ya
but
um like you said I think at that point of time we were young
okay and you know at at that point of time I had a very terrible okay maybe this is an excuse
but I had a terrible time with my family remember my parents were divorcing at that point of time right I had it tough then
I was very temperamental emotional okay lah I was a shitty person
then
ah
we bump into each other and then
keep like letters
pictures
for him it was very thoughtful because
I mean it's not expensive you just like what print out a template and you write but to him he was very it was a very thoughtful gift
so I'm a sucker for that kind of thing I'm a sucker for like letters and stuff like that so
like recently I was looking through my memory box and then I saw
at the wedding
he was looking at me
I basically I tried to flirt with him tau
no
I think he kind of
learn his lesson so he tried not to engage
it's he was my best friend yes but we we both now lead a different life
and he has his group of friends I have a group of friends
and I don't know whether I can fit into his life anymore
I mean people change right
err it was a not okay now it's funny but that point of time it wasn't
oh wait no or was it a date
after that
we'll we'll both very angry with each other then we didn't talk to each other
I think so lah I think I can't remember where but
it was at a a station
ya
ya no
no no I mean like as in
then
asked a feedback
from him about me
I asked him I said
err what do you think of me when I was your girlfriend back then
said um
because that's me as a person that's my personality
but
ya so in a way after that whole conversation I apologise again lah
so it was all cool
at that point of time yes
but
I remembered my two relationship will my two exes
ya then kind of got me um
traumatised
seriously
he's just so
ya
there's a lot of things that I really want to change like
serious seh I shouldn't have been
playing that kind of game back then
do you think it's a crazy idea if ever
one day

mmhmm

mm

mmhmm

mm
mmhmm
mmhmm

my side recording
five four three two one
you know I think that's one topic you can do because I don't think even if we talk all these leh I don't think this err all the researchers I think it's okay lah to all these to talk about all these things ah I don't maybe they won't even understand what's that it all about
a'ah
mm
mm
mm
uh uh god knows how many weeks at least thirty two weeks err assuming one game a week lah
you know maybe we can have a community thing alright where
per person and have this a sixty four or maybe even one two eight maybe even one two eight per ah for the whole tournament kan then we take just ten percent that's uh between us and what sixty dollars to or even a hundred twenty eight dollars divide by two thirty to sixty dollars each
I mean ya it's not it's not that bad you you earn that in like one hour lah outside lah now but at least this is a start this is you know we we don't really need to put in money
if we could have done this for free but at least we're getting some money and and the community we get ninety percent in total we can even have top eight get something
maybe the if you reach top eight you get your money back
something like that ya you get or or even more than that top sixteen we'll we'll figure we'll figure things out lah but whatever it is at least eh the whole tournament um one winner on one day two hundred dollars not like that league you gotta pay so many different matches to not even to get less than that ya
uh I drop it in discord
ya so
so they have this new league
I don't know how many people have signed up so far
um I just didn't know
you know the this league not worth it seriously
ah
ah
en
mm
ya
ah
mm
mm
a'ah
a'ah
ah ah
mm
mmhmm
ah exactly exactly ya
mm
ah
ah
mm
mm
I'm thinking because
the our original idea the main selling point lah is that social media aspect lah so
but um the social media aspect of a one off thing eh
err
ah ya
ya
ah
ya that's best best
that's the truth as well there's a truth it's a bit of a bumper about what to do what what you said earlier was right and ah we we don't have anything on our on our portfolio eh how are they going to trust us with their money as well
we also got to make it
not ah
mm mm
hmm hmm hmm maybe maybe who knows maybe
mm
mm mm
mm
I
ah okay all the tournaments then
you know so
ya so
mm
mmhmm
mm
err five dollars
five dollars okay I'm thinking
what if okay one okay let's let's set a price pool one thousand dollar price pool strictly for the community one thousand dollar price pool we have then we tell them look guys we got no sponsors no nothing
you know err so err or maybe we don't even we don't even need to say that ah we just say look there there's a competition we're gonna make here one thousand dollar price pool eh wait but if we are this is not gonna be a one off tau this is gonna be like a weekly thing so how are we going to
mm
mm
ya correct
uh huh
ya okay
uh huh
ya
mm
okay I have a idea they just came to mind okay so let's say eh we do everything for every
let's say every saturday lah eh every saturday we have something
okay we have we have this event K to get to to to enter each week you got to pay five dollars just five dollars first each week
okay so let's say I can get err thirty two players
on average K that's one hundred sixty dollars
once exhort ya it's not much right but every week
K we tell them alright we have um four four prize winners
each of the prize winners err okay and then at least err total weekly prize pool maybe two hundred dollars something like that
alright um
or we could just put it every every week err the cash price right winner guaranteed a hundred dollars plus twenty percent of the of the registration fees
something like that I I don't know the actual number lah K the the hope is that I'm telling them look you guys you want to increase the port get as many people to sign up as as much as possible
our limit for the whole day alright will be a hundred twenty eight players per day
okay a'ah and then like this ah we go all the way down to maybe like top sixteen top sixteen you get five percent of the registration feedback
of the all the registration pool lah basically lah alright so let's say top sixteen so that's thirty two okay let's say eh thirty two players alright top sixteen you get five percent so that's one hundred sixty dollars
ya
something like that okay so okay ya we can do something like that lah so let me get up my word pad my notepad ah so let's say top sixteen five percent so I six five per cent sixteen times times stuff about sixteen times five
oh six eight
that's eighty percent for the top sixteen that's five percent each and then ten percent ya that's actually ah we can't do that maybe top eight ah top eight get five percent lah
yes
ah
ya get a wise five uh eh
so top eight
that's forty percent ya correct correct
top eight
forty percent okay
uh huh
a'ah
no no no not top four ten percent
ten percent ah
top two
fifteen percent
and then champion
twenty percent
asked the floor just my percentage turn out is great lah okay
okay so let's say okay so we got four winners who will only get five percent
four winners only
K
um
ya
eh of the total registration fee
correct correct and that is before any additional cash prize we can put champion gets thirty percent of registration fee plus guaranteed
two hundred three hundred whatever it is lah whatever amount
there will really get people to like eh siala if I can get top eight so so top eight is five percent of total registration fee plus another fifty dollars
so people are thinking at eh I only pay five dollar registration fee tau I get guaranteed fifty fifty percent plus god knows how many much more
people register
the more people register the bigger my price pool
a'ah correct
so that's it we need to have at least
um
um
okay but that's why okay you um then it's only top eight get prizes
if we have thirty two players even if they get a buy they're still into the top sixteen
mm mm
mm true also true also difficult ah
mm
sixty four possible
mm
ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
en
mm
so this idea eh is basically if I were to go to N
en
err but I can't guarantee whether he is that he is not working under SCOGA
you know and they want and if this is going to secure a FIFA market for them kan they're all out for it
his words lah
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
let me
ah
let me try and see if I can find err
err what's that called lah
SCOGA event and see how were they how they marketed it
err basically they're having this league I don't know how long the league is which is just it's a two V two thing
strictly for boys and girls aged thirteen to seventeen years old
SCOGA is the one that does the the the operations ah
it's a it's a carbon copy
so is SCOGA will have the logo there and then err this err will have err the our
what I'm afraid of eh is that got they're gonna keep the idea for themselves if that's if that's a that's a legitimate thing or not
everything has to be done by us
ya exactly
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya ya ya ya definitely definitely so so that's the thing that I'm I'm you know I have been thinking of and I've been battling myself about lah like
err like um even when I I told her the idea look ah why not err we work together we are loudmouth and see what they can get as well
and she said you know like no it it it shouldn't be under loudmouths she doesn't want us to work under loudmouths to do all these tau she want us to be on our own
we need to have our name because we are promoting us if people were if we were to show you know like potential sponsors hello we did this event tau
and then that's definitely you know parleyed didn't african lah
that's the number one thing ah
yes
ah
ah
mm
like our problem right now is finding our own third party sponsor lah
a
ah
ah
so that's the difficult part also so that that is one reason why as much as possible um you know
the main reason is I don't want if adult person I don't want us to spend money at all lah you know ya so that's that's the main thing right ya so and you know another thing also I think it doesn't really help us in this particular
err potential conversation that we're going to have with potential sponsors as well
um
ya ya correct
a
uh huh
a
you will have your own you know shout out lah you know the sponsor what they do and stuff like that
and there is a a match that because you're doing real life football academy for kids and some of the competitors are dads they also have kids so you have your name up there you know and it will come who knows maybe we get one person to join your academy from there
or at or even more than that or at least the word of mouth will come in I mean that's the whole point of advertising ah a lot of my understanding of people sponsoring events eh is that you know it's just to get the name out and most they err how to say that the
ya there's no monetary returns you're just getting your name out there it's just another way of getting your name out there that is not on billboards you don't spend money on paying billboards and stuff but you know you're going directly to the customer lah in a way lah
it's the same as advertisement ah so I'm thinking the the one positive is that at least your company is football related and our our event is virtual football
ya ya ya or even worst the only them in there
a
mm but I'm okay now I'm okay ya still in my head eh I totally agree with what you said I'm just entertaining what if we what if we actually do it and how can we work it into our product
we can also say that K look this is the amount of time that we spent talking about junior football academy
we can tell to potential sponsors look ya okay let's put aside the fact is it junior football academy
football school sorry about that sorry about that so okay err so we go okay we make one weekly event alright then we can go back to the sponsors and say look in that one weekly event right I spent a total of thirty minutes running time just talking about you know
let's put aside the fact it belongs to us lah okay was like that but that is for for whatever money you put in alright thirty minutes of our air time goes to you of the whole eight hour whole eight hour thing thirty minutes of the time we spent talking about you and nothing else when we talk about you your product
and that's that's a lot of airtime for relatively little a money input from you guys
you know so and that just one week that it's just one day not even one week one day so with our league that's gonna run for two months plus and we don't need you know again we only need that set amount of money from you you know so what is thirty minutes times
eight weeks how many hours and hours I was we spend time talking just on your one product
we can talk a lot of shit man you know for you guys
ya
mm
yup mm mm mm
so
ha ha
a'ah sia
alamak
alamak
okay
okay
ya
okay
um
there's another
ah correct correct so but I can I can load I can load one and one play E sports lah
one play E sports
pure err pure cup malaysia nine hundred ninety views
per hour for one hour nine hundred ninety views
you know
mm
ya the singapore premier league a week ago err three point eight K views
mm
err what's that called
okay E singa cup the one that we so called we lost to game gamers semi finals to our song fourteen thousand views fourteen K the finals is six and a half K views
quarter final seven K
err E singa cup
okay ya well that was for the pro clubs ah
for the one V one E singa cup
one V one E singa cup
oh they split it into
the whole league
part two another three hours was five point eight K view so it's actually in the thousands ah early thousands
you know so ya
oh shit
one point two people like this
so on that much one point two K
ah
two thousand two thousand eight hundred followers
two point eight K followers
so okay and what we can do is we can cost
force you know we can one stream
we can post it on my at the and my channel will post it your channel will stream it my channel will stream it your channel will stream it our you know our new channel err you know like specifically for these events will also stream it
so that
ya that would that would really help
because eh if it'll be better it will be a lot better
instead of just err aiman giving a shout out
for us people might not follow ya people might not follow but if we are able to cast stream to his thing
to to his channel
and then err what's that called ah ya and then like this ah people will be alerted
ya
exactly
ah correct correct
so so that's the thing if we can if we are able to pull him ya and then you know we can
we can actually I I I've been trying to find a way to pull him in but the thing is this is gonna be a strictly singapore thing because ah I don't know how to send prize money to malaysians that's one problem
ah
sorry researchers I didn't mean to say but it is a really huge thing I understand you're feeling gutted you didn't get the huge thing but
a
ya
um
ya not that bad correct correct so I'm thinking you know maybe we can we can pull him in and get the malaysian viewers also
you know and all we want eh it's just boost the numbers the viewership you know that's all we need
or whatever we can uh we can get lah we can tell them look that's an easy ten thousand views
ah ya so
mm
so I maybe we can tell them a lot of things it's okay maybe they don't know who sekaiichi is ah they just look at pure viewership numbers ah we can talk about them eh we can talk about the concurrent numbers the viewership and stuff like that
that's no issue get a number of views
ya I can
ya so
so now we've got two two routes here we can just make everything on our own without sponsorship then you have to go the long and slow way I got a slog it out it's a outward slug if we do it this way every week one separate event and we try to build up viewership from there
ah
the other way is if we go to existing partners like SCOGA zenway or whatever I I I think of the three that I personally know of which is one place zenway and SCOGA I think SCOGA have the best in because um and you know really likes to work together with me lah basically lah
ya but I don't know anybody else in SCOGA lah so it will we will be highly or solely dependent on them
if we were to go there lah
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm ah
okay so
it's a society
wants to make a difference in the local gaming scene especially in developing the local E sports in I think ya there will be
who do they have

uh um
um
uh
um
err ya then err
ah ya
yes true
yes
yes it was a very memorable experience
yup our childhood cartoon
yes it was good days good old times
yup
yup I agree
oh yes I remembered about my first phone I was so I was so happy at first because I always get um
but and ya I was happy to have my first personal phone but I'm sad err cause I wish I could have took care of it properly as you can see I'm a clumsy person sometimes
ya but it was nice having a first personal phone that's how you feel you you just have your own item your your personal only item and you don't have to share with anyone yup that feeling
well for me personally it depends only the individual
if you are the type of person who prefer to like have your personal phone they don't want to have like second hand phone then it's up to them as if they are able to afford it um ya it's their choice I for me I for me it's like
uh any phone is fine as long as I can use it it's like because I don't really care I'm not gonna do like do crazy things with my phones I'm not gonna show off ya unless I'm a person who works with phones and have to use advanced technology phones but
ya but um
last time the past our phones with the camera with there was no tapping we I mean like no selfie you know in ya the first
the latest the old phones will like nokia why I like if like nokia there was games like snake and I think most of us know and then there were buttons that we had to press and click
and we had to message back uh just like that but now the phone is
easy you can type your phone you can ya it um even the old the elderly they can they also learn how to use these phones but it can be a struggle for them also because like
they are not used to this type of phones but um maybe slowly learn they are able to know how to use it so ya there's a lot of things you can use now with our with the phones
you can watch online stuff learn what and and learn things online you can listen to music upload music take pictures take videos memories yup and download games
a lot of games you can download yup
yup
well for me where
I'm okay with any phone but I I for me I'm like a cheapskate I don't really like expensive phone as long like it can it's functional and able to
give me err excellent service and I I'm able to use it well I mean that ya if it's very useful and can function why not um just buy err knowledge and
no need I don't really need a very expensive phone ya err just like latest model phone will be alright ya
ya I kind of agree yup having a phone that um which can't last long for the battery is actually no because sometimes we travelled or work um then like we sometimes use our phones then
then sometimes ah okay example you use a a phone that the battery does not last long and then uh you are on the way back home and you want to update your family saying that you're on the way home but
you don't want to make them worry but in the end your phone died and let's say you don't have a charger it's hard so like you won't like it you make yourself
you will make your family worried you and they will be wondering where were you where where when you are trying to say err when you yourself actually is alright but ya because ya sometimes you need to contact your families for important stuff ya
yes I agree
ya if if your phone die during overseas and you don't have let's say you have a charger that will be very hard so
ensure you always have a charger with you or portable charger will be nice nowadays we use portable charger right ya then we when we go public and places that we find a plug we just like go charge our phone there ya I mean I mean the phone will be charged at there itself ya
yes I really miss johor so much our old house ya but now it's um make it we made it into a rented house but it's nice cause our old house is like a not a bungalow terrace what is it ah abu
oh it's a terrace oh okay
yup because ah it has I like how the house is I mean it's it's like two stories but nothing much but I why I like is about echo like we can echo our voices and err I I kinda like how neat is it neat it is
but ya name but
I wish that the the staircase cause I remember because our staircase is like made of wood and like there were termites eating those woods that which cause our staircase to like break so it's not fun lah ya why do you why do you think about the termites at the staircase abu
sticky sambal I mean like definitely miss woodhouse no old your whole house but ya the termites fallen was really I mean to be fair it's not really on main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's probably where the termites governments it's honestly quite sad ya
ya I agree
ya but I think it's uh it's whatever happens um
we can learn from it actually and I mean like in the future if you want a house and then you can decide the flooring what kind of flooring type you want so like like you won't easily get damaged you know like that
yup
ya I really agree
I agree
yup
um because when you go when singaporeans go to malaysia where they buy stuff it's actually cheaper what I most of it I like is the malaysia food it's tasty especially the burger ramly burger ramly that I miss the most yup and the abalone
going holidays on malaysia was awesome you know with family and you guys spend a lot of err cheap stuff you know yup travel and save money at the same time
yes it's very it's very sad yes I really miss going to cause
yup err sometimes we went to the website one motoring dot com to like every time when we're at our father ask who wants to go johor and he ask like
ask to check at the website if it's there's traffic jam at the causeway you know you remember that abu
and just enjoy the scenery of malaysia
mm I think so
um ah we went to cycling um
ah we went to the you know the playground there maybe you can climb the building not buildings like an obstacle course it was scary because it's very
it's very high and I was afraid to cross over the bridge err you had to climb it's like you have to climb from below and climb up there's a ladder I was afraid because I was afraid of heights when I was young but after trying or we went there for several times and we
ah and we tried um tried their ah that big obstacle for several times and after getting used to it uh you like the fear of height it has been reduced and it's actually fine when you going up when you're going up
and the height
you know you look up I mean you climb up on a high
I don't know how to say abu like you look high up and you look at the scenery ya it's actually nice you know you can see everything from the top
ya
so they have much experience with high element obstacle course
um yes because I was um for my I was from
and we had to go to camp in sec two in sec three I can't remember
um I think it's
also known as survival training camp when I was in secondary three and and then one of the activities we had to do was high elements
oh wait I can't um
oh actually I think I didn't went um
I think rock climbing actually I also had it or uh high elements in um school camps too yup okay one of it was rock climbing
rock climbing
okay rock climbing was I I did check for the first time okay um my camp was at the pulau ubin there ya
um I remember I think secondary two as the first time I went for the rock climbing is that I climb for the first time I couldn't reach to the top I think I already reached for the uh I already get to climb for first second because I was
I my body couldn't manage to like climb up anymore um ya but after the following year I I was able to make I was managed to um rock climbing till the top so it was a great achievement ya it was a very great achievement cause like
um you know first time you climb halfway you can reach to the top
ya like like you did you did not manage to reach your goal but you try again for the next time and ya it was fun rock climbing even my sister is a rock climber
cause she like to do sports stuff so ya ya high elements really taught us how to be
how to not be afraid be confident just try your best and you have fun at the same time you know face your fear and come out from your comfort zone and be adventurous yup
well there's there was a lot actually
um I remember um
I can't um in secondary school we did a lot of things
um like uh like camps mostly camps
err give I remember um chinese new year hamper wrapping ya we eat at the class
then national days uh and then what else oh err it was sad because you know every year racial harmony day example in primary school you're able to wear like your traditional clothes you know
ya but last time uh in our secondary school um we didn't get it for my school which is evergreen secondary school we ain't got a chance to wear traditional clothes but like last year
um cause we had we change our principal I um our principal allow us to wear traditional clothes ya then yup I decide I did wear it once only
and then in school we also had charity bazaar is where students from I think secondary two
in each individual class will have to plan and organize they have to organize and plan to like their booth
and what do you want to do you do it do they want is actually I think yes ya they separated into two teams like one they uh do uh about
food and beverages like what food or drinks they want to serve and another team was like what items they want to do they want to do photography booth or like I don't know they want to add handicraft stuff booth
um ya
and all of them all of these charities err will be donated to the uh respective
respective people like maybe for those who are for those in needs lah for the for the less fortunate people ya so like how it works is
like you have to buy a coupon is that uh you have to buy with your money you have to buy coupon and exchange with the coupon to buy err to go to the booths and enjoy but charity bazaar was a nice experience too ya I spent like
first firstly I spend ten dollars then I was like I need more cause it was amazing cause I want to try more like the food the games ah and then there's also game booths and I did won I mean you err I mean I did won some merchandise you know but ya it was a good experience
yup it was a very fun experience and you know you get to see like creative ideas like how the secondary two secondary two students like example the food and drink booth the learn how to
uh plan like who's going to do this and that and like what kind of drinks do you want to do ya it's like they
they are they are very creative you know and the food how they gonna handle it who's gonna do this and that the way it's cooked yup and it's very good it's a really good opportunity for them to learn how to handle a and organize a booth yup and in secondary schools
mm ya and we have a lot of programmes lah actually I remember participating in english fortnight programme um like I have to I think I can't remember was I chosen or
I don't know because my classmate encourage me to join I think then we'd we had to play a like you know hangman
but guess the word and it was very fun and I get to meet students from different classes too and I'm very impressed um how the way how they speak
we and their english ah the way they speak is very fluent and I really admire that um I could say that
they have been reading a lot of maybe news or read a lot of books books yup err from there I I I should also learn how to
read more books because it also it can also help to improve in my vocabulary as can see my vocabulary is not that strong and I don't really use very strong vocabulary ya and there's a lot I can learn from them lah ya
well like after secondary school it's like study I was actually happy that I finish study because I really there's like studying is not
my it's not my type lah actually um but ah for me
I was like you're after secondary school like you had a choice you err like example for me uh I was given a choice to go to I I did wish to go to poly but ya is also like poly but
err
like I in is like you get a lot of an opportunity to learn from a teacher like um ya um
it's like school also but no ah I mean like there's teachers in charge who will be taking care of you and look out for you but ya it's the life is different because like it's in
in secondary school there is like rules and teachers who will always be with you but in or like poly it's like all of your time will be on your own and with your classmates and then you just comfort plus you know ya but in
there's a lot okay there's a lot of course now like engineering there's hospitality there is
um
sports there's a lot ah actually ya and yup oh to apply for the course you have to apply online and then go for the interview and then
ya you make a resume of yourself and then ya they went for interview and if
you do well and everything's fine you get chosen yup and I really ya I like in a variety like in school is I had made a lot of friends and we get live for each other and our teacher was very caring they already took
they really look out for each of their students and we learn like life skills lesson and we also have pre lesson life skills lesson is like
it's like for like what we what we will learn for ourselves lah like how to improve our communication skills that all but we have a long assignments to the projects that need to be completed
yup but for me like
um doing projects with classmates sometimes can be very hard because they don't want to communicate or maybe because I prefer to do my own I prefer to do like individual cause like I know what to do ya and
and like I really learn a lot of video editing like for myself because project we have to take video right and then you have to present you know and then we learned how to use I learned how to use I mean my err using my skills I learned how to use microsoft word
like for my project and microsoft powerpoint like but I I it's it's good that in secondary school uh we didn't have like workshops and we learn how to use it ya
and because like are maybe some jobs or I think most jobs lah like you have to make err you need to make a proposal example or like a review you have to use your skills and do it online with microsoft word
microsoft office basically err and
for me like my course I choose pastry and baking um
because I I cause why I choose that course is um I I I want to learn how to uh bake things and like learn new recipes and I also
wish that I could be I could like make my own
um pastries and all and then I can like sell it like I it's fun lah to bake for people you know for your loved ones and they enjoy eating it so ya it's nice to like bake stuff bake delicious desserts and all ya
oh um okay there's a lot of things I learn during my course like last year
here we did a lot um okay like I remember we made a fruit tart and then we made um I think lemon meringue tart and then we made madeleine
or financier focaccia and it's a great um
then we make sourdough and and then what else we made err the pizza it um and we also make cakes um black forest cake and I think strawberry shortcake or is it vanilla sponge cake I I yup something like that but like
but I wish I could err redo my cake like I redo how I decorate because I was not experienced on decorating it
ya it was hard to make sure to cake is like
like if ah even you know like how I cut it cause like you know when you bake a cake there's like uh you have to cut it into threes uh three parts or what cause you want to stack it and then like filling with it and ya you have to make sure
when you after you bake it right you must make sure you cool down the cake
and then chill it in the fridge
then after chilling it and err after err the cake is chilled and then you can like decorate your cake so and the filling
cause if if you try to like put the filling err at the cake when the cake is hot the filling will melt you know
so like ya you did cake while it's cold it is nice actually ya
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
oh okay I remember um we didn't make okay err I didn't make cream puff before and then in the you know like the dough name is pate choux in french and then you know uh we had to do eclaire choux so it's basically the eclaire dough like the the
the dough right it's like the same like uh cream puff is actually the exactly the same you know it's just the way you pipe it
so I was I tried to after my err my class advisor though
um my sir showed us uh a cake chef show us how how to demonstrate for the practical the eclaire then when it was time for practical for me to do I didn't know why but I tried doing my eclaire and the
the dough this thus call the dough consistency was very runny I don't know why but I repeated like I think I repeated two or three times
then after that I was like okay I'm done so in the end I did try to help my coursemate cause I saw my classmate struggling to so I tried to assist to and see and observe what can improve and all ya
but I get when I see my other classmates who uh they're also very creative and innovative innovative people the way they decorate it and do very
passionate and I'm amazed lah like they have really nice talents to um which I can also learn from them
ya
oh my lecturer name my err we call him sir jeremy
ya he's really err sir jeremy is a very nice uh teacher he
the uh he always tried to make class fun him he make us like one of his like his children his kids and then like
he's our he's like our uh parent like a a a father to us yup
and like if when he joked with us we can also joke him but when it comes to assignments and attendance and attitude is we have to ensure that is we have
to you know be punctual and all don't cause any trouble when we cause trouble to him uh he will be very disappointed and you wouldn't want that and who err
which teacher doesn't want to see their children uh their I mean their kids the students to you know do well in their studies and succeed you know I mean like
cause like you teach your student and then you make them when you see them succeed you feel very like a proud like a very proud like err like proud parent you know like like you teach your kid how to
how to you know be independent and all yup I think being a teacher is very hard sometimes
but but it's also a very like you have to share your experience like your life experience and then like your students can learn from you at same time and you know and ya learn from one and another yup
um
do you mean during COVID nineteen
um I don't know I I
ya actually I all I want is to go to malaysia you know just go to malaysia go shopping and all but it's ya it's so sad that COVID nineteen happens you know ya and we have to wear mask nowadays and hand sanitizers but
um this COVID nineteen really showed us a lot like
like shows err appreciation to our loved ones cause like
like example does uh when first week COVID nineteen happened like those foreigners like working in a foreigner country couldn't go back to their own country cause uh because of COVID nineteen cause cause of work right and then they can't really they
couldn't see their family for I think for a lot for more than one month I I can't remember how much I think more than six months and it's very sad you know but you're doing this for your family you know working in a foreign country
be separated with family but you're still able to contact with them video call with you know
ya it's very sad but it's really I mean you you're sacrificing
everyone is sacrificing for the family you have to work you know for your family you know your children
yup well COVID nineteen also show us like to like you know have a safe distancing like don't like you have to take care of your hygiene you know hygiene is really important because example lah like um
example people who use the toilet our public toilet after using the toilet you don't really wash their hands and that's really not a good thing I mean it's gross lah
then like you you don't wash your hand and then you touch things here there and then like the next person who touch the items will can get effected you know
so like
COVID nineteen has tweak up a lot people about hygiene wash your hands with soap
yup and and like you know err in restaurants last time was like uh you already allow I think three people per table I think
and then they put the um the cross X tape at the chair which is sad you know because like like you are used to eating with with a lot of people but then after that like you need to minimize the amount of people eating at per table it is like
so like ya
but it's great that the then like the national day even this national day
like um um
like those who are involved in the parade also have to wear a mask which is
which can be a struggle you know like cause wearing a mask
um I know wearing a mask it will it will helps um to ensure that people are safe
from spreading virus and germs while wearing a mask also is a struggle like for me cause like you know sometimes it's hard to breathe it's hard to talk with your friends
can't hear what you're saying cause sometimes I try to talk also and then like my this in my voice is soft and I try to repeat and it's still soft and then I have to take off my mask to speak yup it's very it's very tiring to talk with a mask sometimes
but ya wearing a mask for me
like for my for my face lah example like I have mask acne like ya it can
pimples can grow at my face when I wear masks which are it's scary not I mean like having break out when we because of the mask is not a good thing which we ya I have to take care of my skincare routine and ya but we all need to um get used to wearing masks
yup and we must enjoy is as a singaporean we have to enjoy cause we are working as a
as a citizen
to ensure COVID nineteen uh to keep out take our part and ensure that all of us are safe from COVID nineteen as we and we follow the rules and regulation everything will be alright
and like um it's good at the government give us
I think some
income right I think for most I think for low incomes for for those who lose their jobs during COVID nineteen yup and and ya we got hand sanitizers now we're used to hand sanitizers you know
um
ya and but now when going out you need to always ensure you have your mask
wear a mask I I once forgot like I was like went out for I went out then I was like something was missing
and then I was looking around like oh ya it was my mask I had to rush back and get back my mask which is the struggle and oh and I was oh I was rushing to school ya
and you know wearing a mask is also a nice it can be good and bad and also be good because that you can cover your I mean you can cover your face
for those people who are introvert and does not like to speak and doesn't like show your face mask wearing mask is a good thing cause people can't recognize you that's what I like about wearing mask
ya mm but it's hard to breathe sometimes and ah ya
mm I don't know lah like
I don't know as long I can survive I do what I can maybe learn just keep on learning thing new things and all ya
um so abu um
so how ah I heard that you went on on a holiday I mean you went on a staycation with your friend

this is called independent learning never heard of that before ah
I mean when you're going to go to work also they also just throw you some
work for you to do what they won't even explain to you

woohoo
let's go hello
mmhmm
okay but one question are you gonna answer it too
no
okay let's go
mmhmm
oo
I think that's a question where did you get them from
just random ya um I think if I were to follow my dreams what am I risking I think I will risk family time
family time is
crucial right
a bit of both
he's just a guy that always ask us to do what we wanna do
how do I do
oo
ya
that's a good superpower
oo
saves time
ya
wow
I've never thought of that
unusual
oo
then I think
uh first few pictures would be my grandparents and then my parents nothing much cause I don't
think there will be a lot of things in the time capsule
ten years ago oo
right
wow
wow ya that's a tough
like a period of time you know everybody has a tough period during secondary school especially sec one cause like dude
we did not alter our skirts did you remember we talk about this we did not alter
skirts we we don't know
ya
mmhmm
ya
I think that is peer pressure
kan
I think if I don't have like much friends last time
yes
cause you have like certain clans I don't know whether it it it happens in your school
since we're talking about school but like my school has a lot of clans
like the pretty one one side and then the people are one side so
I don't belong in any groups so that's a hard part sometimes I don't even eat just sit down in class just just
oo
oh you call it monitor in your school
class chair
mmhmm
mmhmm
they have different ya
mmhmm
I was that girl
I was that girl
no I oh ya I forgot we had the I forgot we had the blazer on
ya but for my school we call it um have to
we don't just have prefect we have like a two uh different roles
so there's like a student council and student leader
student leader is student leader you just do like basic um just make sure all the class are good and everything but student council which I was in we do a lot with discipline master
ya so for student um leader
if I'm not wrong we only had they only had um the badge but for mine I have the badge I have the tie the blazer
so ya coming from
and we are good with uh literature so we really have to do good in both
ya
so ya
mmhmm
of course
mm
ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
like a stable right
ya
ya and that's why secondary school was the toughest
primary school was okay I would say
but secondary school like the pressure is on everything have to do good or else you have to repeat um sec four
except for school show cause like for our
time we had to go sec five
had to
ya had to but then
ya
mm
in school
oo
yes
something else
wow
the best
mmhmm
ya
ya
ya
yes I think that's my most memorable one
that's my answer
chicken wrap
ya bubble tea then they had to close and then they changed to like a random mini cafe with like that was after I graduate so
ya but that's for me but for you
the two dollars
ya
kan
I just remembered it's behind the drink stall
oo ya
ya
fragrant
oo
ya
the ramen the japanese ramen that's my number one
ah that's good ramen there's the
end stall that's why
but ya
that's the best one so two top two is
two dollar chicken wrap and also kimchi ramen
the beef
ramen
ya
ya
anything that is not generic to you you're like no I know you
I mean
as long as halal
okay
so for the bad podcast
oo
we're sticking to that oh my god ya
ya
sensitive
ya
perspectives
mmhmm
well we're talking about bullies remember just now we're talking about
um bullies in secondary school
well I was labelled as a boy
ya
okay cause
was number one for me
I did all the that are good sports to I have multiple
usually do sports and music I was in band and then I moved to volleyball netball softball
that's primary school itself
it's all that's
so that's that ya
oo don't get me started on secondary school but was much lower but like for
secondary school I did let me run through
ah
secondary school I my number one yes my number one all time is
um which if nobody knows what it means national police cadet corps
uh and then I also did aside for
volleyball netball floorball same what like primary school and then I also did tchoukball
tchoukball it's a I don't know whether a lot of people heard or not yes
tchoukball
bounce back to you you're supposed to not catch it it's the opponent who supposed to catch it to save the points
a side of rugby during did everything
ya but like labels itself ya I was labelled as a boy
my voice
ya
the the topic is about bullies
but like ya bullies uh I remember one time
cause it's hard
I think I was in like secondary two or sec one
like early secondary school days
and then she just looked at me and I remember her face I remember her name until now
I'm just saying
but I remember her name until now I remember her face I saw her before actually okay but we're not gonna talk about that
but like um she like looked at me she's younger by the way
she's like I think it was sec three or something like that ya she's a junior
she just came then she looked me she was like
um
just wanna ask are you a boy before this
so for me at that point you know at that age we're like huh what did I do wrong
and she starts yes
so I just stared at her you know anyway we're at the drinks stall so the uncle heard everything
okay
this is not the first time she did to me
I still have hours in school and I'm trying to like
forget what she said
but ya so people start posting my pictures online
and say about like how I act
I mean
ya
ya
council you're the thing you're popular but
that I say it you know so it's pretty tough to make friends
cause my own friends
like
kill me from the back
ya
so I learn everything
from the start about how
ya
come back to school the next day and see the same people and
like you stay in school more hours than you are at work generally
people at work don't care about you
there's nothing about ya
people are there to maybe get money
you know different reasons but for school it's just school people don't have other reasons
so that's a hard part
label with
wow
orh
wow
one wish
I would say
whatever people say about me I tend to believe it's true
like you're a boy you are you are like you act so rough
you are this you are that or you
are that friend
as people like to say you know I mean
I will go through it you know
ya
ya
I think I never think of what you
want to think of it's cause I tried to stand up for myself but then again cause of confidence I tend to be like
mm
mmhmm
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
I've been talking
oh
have to work for the money it's what you're saying
oo
ya
mmhmm
like you have no
eight to five job to go to right oo
what are humans catered to do
travel I think
but oo
just think about the human traffic here and there
and there's no limit like I think work is what limit you
you're like okay ah I only have like a week okay I want to plan everything right
cause I have to go back to work the next day I think that's what we are meant to be doing
but if we have no work
that's like a life of a retired person
I would say
they do whatever they wanna do use the money
uh plan their day but there's no rush which is a good thing
cause there is no time limit for it anything that you wanna do
cause we are not
um you don't have any commitment to something
mm
mm
wow
I've been there before
ya should I say the one I've been there before or should I create something
again
cause bali eh bali balling okay
it's a mini paradise
if you want like a bigger paradise people would say it's maldives
and stuff like that but I actually wanted to go dubai
I am an expensive girl
no I want to go dubai for sure cause my number one bucket list since like young
is to go dubai and go skydiving in the palm jumeirah
ya
ya
yes
that's why I want to go there
like scared
level seven is already like now I live in level seven
it's already too high for me I used to live at level two
all the way but this one is level seven
oo
you know what I've known you for quite awhile thirteen is too much for me
the floor kan it's not like the straight
so your house it's already scary for me I don't know about skydiving but I wanna try
you're being no you're going with me
yes
screw secondary school
screw bullies
a'ah
ya
mmhmm
ya
okay
ya let's go
for free
it's free
but what
ya that's all I think I will go
imagine being a traveller
like working as a traveller
how risky not how cool how risky
it's up to the producer tau
that's risky
okay
mmhmm
in specific
mmhmm
generally
drama
it's you I
I'm not a movie person I cannot commit to any episodes actually
but if I have to choose romance is me
ya romance is me
I like romance
oh you know what a good movie that I never get bored of even like after ten years twelve years
ya
no really
no joke ya
I'm like a
hardcore fans of white chicks I heard they coming out the second one but
they say twenty twenty kan
twenty twenty hasn't been that great
but you know
anyway ya your turn
since you've been asking me
your genre
mm
that's the thing I don't like to watch
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
we're not alone
of course
ya
you know I love that ya
mm
but something that really shook you up
oh ya
ya
ya
mmhmm
ya
money
ya
mmhmm
ya
but generally in life
I like to think that
anything can exist
as long as you prove me like
the opposite then I still believe it exists
you know what I mean
that's why as long as it prove to me
that whatever my thought is it's wrong
it doesn't exist then sure
but for now I believe in anything
anything
ya
apocalypse
how
ah
ya
infected
um
wow
everything is it's a circle of life you know how we started is how we end
overthinking ya
ya let's not talk about that part but um how would we end humankind
there's COVID pandemic thing already making people killing people I would say cause it's in india the stats are getting higher and higher
numbers are going down and stuff like that but
it's not gonna go down to zero we're not like vietnam or something was it vietnam
like the the first country that went zero
all I know is like ya taiwan taiwan that's the one ya
but like how long could that last
and how long could this um virus itself
exist so I think humankind human itself
would be extinct due like a virus
cause it's gonna start killing yourself like softly wow
it's gonna kill us slowly
ya it is actually
gonna kill us slowly cause we are finding for
a cure
you know but I have
I have faith
cause if cancer can have its cure any virus can have its cure you know
a little stress
oh ya ya
oo fun fact we only know twenty percent if I'm not wrong twenty percent of what's in the ocean can you imagine eighty percent left
ya
mmhmm
ya
and find ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
it's not mandatory
ya although even uh during the haze period it wasn't mandatory it wasn't right
I think also adding on to like how
human would end and stuff
climate change
um whatever we put into the world is what is being given back so when we put like a lot of um like
a lot of burning and everything generally
it's gonna brings back to us cause we're like we are breathing the same air as what we burn ya so ya even the icebergs are melting
so
even the bears are
killing themselves cause they know they couldn't survive in
right so
a lot of things could lead up to that
there's a lot of what ifs
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
is
hmm
if only I have like a good platform cause I feel like every
every individual has its voice
that's cause we don't have a platform I wouldn't say the platform is famous being famous cause people with fame
has a lot of power
so ya
instagram ya that's it but if I can have
influence over at least a hundred people
I would have a platform where the people my age are not even aware of this like they
everything so lightly
you know
it doesn't find us now so
so I think
it's to create a platform where um
one should know
whatever they do whatever they think of
matters now
cause it's what like even the
government in any country has said
like the young people are the voice of the future
so we have to do something about it now
instead of just following through
you know
mmhmm
for the rest of my life
wow
um
okay
shoot
meat
steak wow
everything
ya
boil
oo oh ya
ya
I think
a'ah eh
okay
karma
ya
what goes around comes around
we always tend to think the best of yourself
oh
oh karma
typical straightforward that everybody does it don't lie and say you never done it before
it's when you could help someone but you did not just cause you're
too lazy or too tired
you're just like
ya so
so I think that's my answer
it's it's the time I didn't invest on someone when I had the time
when I had the choice I would say
the choice to put my time invest my time in helping someone and I did not
I think ya
yours
ya
understanding you
what you give to your parents
I wouldn't say disobedience though
ya
ya
oh you're talking like a part
I wasn't thinking about I was thinking of opening the lid at the same time
ya
ya
that's a good one
cause I always think to
to like with parents there's a thin line between respecting and being like I wouldn't say rude but like somewhat disrespectful
but I think with your son you're doing good
ya you're doing good right
ya
ya
actually understanding though
people get tired
so I think my dish
is reasonable
the time is reasonable
ya
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
wow
mmhmm
mm
ya
mmhmm
ya
ya
mmhmm
oo
oh we're talking about
good body or body or good looks right
we're not talking about generally like physically
for boys right we're not talking about with pairs
of course
so I think I would prefer
good body
ya good body
if like you're not healthy reflects bad on your looks
I would say cause looks
what's the point
what's the point ya
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
ya
ya
ya
it only helps during parent teacher meeting jer
ya
you know health is wealth
ya
wow
ya
good one what did I do that I'm not doing now
what am I supposed to do
find like
something to munch
just cause I want to keep my mouth busy
when I'm supposed to keep my body busy
yes
really hard but ya
like it's just cause I'm small
I've never ever hit like
fifty five
but after I know you
no I'm blaming the fact that I'm happy
like whatever is on the scale doesn't matter cause previously I was like a
exercise freak
no I wasn't
I wasn't
ya so I had to make it like a certain number every month
like I have to stay that number
I have to be fit
ya
cause I feel like being fit is what makes me happy
I feel
but after
being in like work
not that I'm not neglecting my body but it's like I feel like happier already
like eating it makes me happy not like stress eating stress eating is different but it's ya but like previously I was like an exercise freak I have to exercise every single day
fives times a day no like five times a week not five times a day that's too much
like in a day I have to exercise three hours more than three hours
in the gym for that long
so
after that I stop
and I feel like it wasn't a need anymore
cause I was just forcing myself to do it and stay like a number below fifty
below fifty is what I always go for
but that wasn't happy
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
prove the fact that you're healthy
there's different ways
some people will find like um the way you eat or
the number of hours you exercise or
just from walking
people would define it as five minute walk and you're okay building the same that means you're healthy depends
but so far
good body
it doesn't matter to me just health
just health ya
for your partner when you look like that
if the answer is opposite
my answer is obvious lah
mm
mm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
wow
wow
are you talking about me
cause that's how I feel
ya of course
mm
ya but any I feel like I want the money
or a house
ya or house
for me it's hard to choose one
there's only one right
ya so money or house
ya
ya just
money is cause I don't want ya
if I don't want to be materialistic but like somehow
people say like money can't buy happiness
but it helps a lot
of course and you know it helps a lot
at times ya at times over like buying something for yourself doesn't make you necessary happy
but just giving it to people is
self amazing ya
ya
easier ya
mmhmm
ya
it makes everything easier
so that's what I would wish for
ya
a house
mmhmm
ya
like a space is what you need
mmhmm
ya
ya
ya
I think you just wanted space for so long
just your own privacy cause privacy matters you know like somehow
not saying that you don't want to be around family but like
privacy
is what we need at this age
cause we've been through like go to work and it's too much
you just want to be home and you want to be lazy
just to recharge
ya
think of it that way
always think what you don't have
cause if you always feel like you're content
you're not gonna progress and progress is like a big thing
so ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ya
patience
ya
ya
both
for the thirteen just now I would say like the confidence

yes

just that singapore don't have that

how much did you buy it for
eh how can you buy second hand

why I was asking ilya then when I
he refuse to do it because he says is a holiday
no lah didn't sort
I don't know
I don't know
I didn't give that mindset what like last time also holiday is like finish up the
um
assessment book that kind but the thing is right um
she wanted to use my phone I think then I was like um
uh
oh like I say you shouldn't have these kind of feeling why when you hear this kind of thing you should be like hey I can do it you know like you're gonna do it if you're gonna start primary school with this kind of like huh maths
then how are you going to get better how are you going to do well
okay okay and uh
that's usual lah cause ilan was around and then he like gives clues he is so annoying you know
I thought that was under you what
timetable kan
like like she can even ask me like when I said
you have one dollar and then you buy this
then
eh err one dollar and then you buy this for like seventy cents like that
then she will ask me err is it err minus or plus
ya ya ya that kind of thing
he knows the basic very well
you know that kind of thing for like
simple stuff lah
she needs to understand why we do that
so I was like telling her ah
is like
ya lah the one he didn't show us right so anyway when I read I read that
he
I felt that he wrote it slightly differently lah formally but
to me
I don't know maybe malay the standard is not high so
he keeps missing out punctuation marks
frankly speaking now that you ask me I don't even remember the english but I remember the malay
he just
punctuation marks I don't know why
I feel like he should there should be a writing camp you know like drill them to writing and then like learn a lesson
okay
huh
huh got such thing ah
ya
the only time I went there is the scholarship lah but
it's so far
um
ah ya did you go for it

mm
ya thank you lyn
okay thank you bye bye

eh amshar I'm doing good lah how how about you
you mean great and just
what's up ah with you and your like the whole COVID situation how has it affected you
ya like your daily life ah
ya I mean to be honest so far my
life has been as per normal because now we all have
preoccupied with things that we need to do lah like like for example
weekend is the only time I got time lah to go out and meet my friends then when we are outside also
got a lot of err measures that have been imposed ah that we need to
you eh what you notice anything different now
as compared to last time when there was no such measures
one hundred is it
hundred people ah now so but is that part of phase three or is it just phase two regulations
phase two
oh so at the end of the day still got the safe distancing measures lah
then I got wedding I need to go to lah next week then is
err from what I know they got three shifts starting from morning all the way to the afternoon
then they separate by like family and friends
people per like per time ah
so that they still adhere to all the the safe distancing measures and now also
then there's no like what intermingling lah between each of the people that are going to be there so the functional groups do not counts lah
ya I mean at end of the day this kind of things how to say this ah is like
it definitely affects how we carry things out like socially lah it goes against like social like norms
cause you go to a wedding to interact with other people and all that and but then I think given the
kind of situation
like I mean get to see each other also
I mean should be grateful lah
ya
oh no serious serious like my uncle's
err wait my uncle's sister wait that's my aunt ya my aunt is getting married
ya
okay ah
eh then that time your I remember you posted something about err
ya that one I'm not
ya
okay okay
okay
okay from what I saw there's like err a bit of a
contention here right because uh
some people say that err
or poly or something ya ya
something like that lah from that's what I understand lah but I haven't really read into it yet lah so
okay
oh
but I mean this kind of things if it's going to affect primary school then of course I think
err will also affect judging from err taking O levels and going to what tertiary education as well lah
ya
speak
ah
I think for me I think it's the same for both of us lah especially
I still need to focus on getting things done and obviously focus on going home or booking out right
ya I mean obviously I think it's quite boring now
but then I guess in the future there'd be
maybe we'll need to use what we learn in army for our own good lah ya
so I think
okay I just ask you honestly ah do you any see do you see any purpose in doing now or not ah
ya
understand understand
ya
ya
you learn life the life lessons that you learn are social lah
work with people
who are from like different different backgrounds like they all come from different areas lah
can or not
ya
like your own circle lah ya I I agree with you about that lah I think
also for me I'm having the same experience army
people outside my own social circle and
err I got to make new friends ah which is quite good also
and at end of the day I feel
that
err these two years err
how to say this not only I guess to a certain extent serve the country but also
ya lah I mean we all have our different opinions about lah but so far ya the year is going to pass soon
ya these two years will not be wasted and I'll still get to
enjoy it lah while it lasts ya
mmhmm
go to or choose to go or not to go
I'd say I think I would choose to not go lah because I feel
like err
I can err
well when I'm outside lah as in cause you think about it now I'm at my prime
eh I'm at I'm at my prime of my youth
I still go I can go out I can go help out treat my parents all that like they all am I as I think
most importantly is like my grandparents lah now is like the best time for me to after right
um you know I take a short break I go help out my grandparents for a while and all that before I start school and all that I think that will be what I want to do and learn
you know travel around the world all that but okay obviously now maybe it's the best time
to be in cause I can't really
do anything else lah ya because of the whole COVID thing I can't really travel also ya but
I think okay ah now looking back err
it's not such a bad deal lah
mm
really meh you think it will really
help us meh like cake
oh okay fair enough
yes
mm
okay okay I mean
ya I guess I uh I mean this is no brain right so
ya let's jump right of the next bed let's go err amshar what do you like to do over the weekend when you're not in
actually no let's change it now like
let's just say uh you're going out with your family
I think those kind of places really got the vibes ah ya
you really just feel like uh you're shut out from the world already then when you go outside that's when you can really spend time with your loved ones lah
ya and especially when you eat home cooked food
ya that's
ya that that's definitely a different experience lah then when you are inside camp when the meals are all provided for you
ya but for me personally I think
err free kan everyone got uh no plans so we all just go err at least have a meal lah together
and most of the time err my mum will cook and then err
we just make it a point to just sit down together at a table and eat ah
you worst comes to worst is err
how you call that we just order in food lah if everyone too tired
ya but
sometimes when there's a bit more free time or I'm blocked leave and now especially school holidays kan
so
even though err we then we will go out like
ya so
we actually we stay in the car then we just drive around singapore lah you know that kind of thing
ya it's just it's just about spending time with your loved ones lah
ya
I think for me I like to
so betweeen spending time with my family and friends because both of them are
are as equal importance to me lah
ya because friends are what uh
has made me like uh what I am today for the
how could I say ah for like the latter part of my life so far but family
ya most of the chapter of my life I'm thinking about my friends lah
but my family is the one that raised me and had been with me throughout my entire life
so I definitely owe it to them ya and I genuinely err
uh enjoy spending time with them lah ya
so it it's definitely I think a struggle cause
so the
so it's all about err that
what you call that
balance lah between err spending time with
err your family and your friends
I think definitely another thing we should talk about is the challenges
with the allowance that we get
your money how do you spend your money on amshar
ya
me ya actually
I'm quite open if we my parents so lately
ya I just share with them then they just share me you know how father lah right they talk about
cannot what it's all they will just exaggerate the stories until it becomes so extreme
and I know they consider us the strawberry generation lah having it easier than them right so
it's nice to have a conversation topic you know with you parents a very natural conversation topic
ya then I guess to a certain extent it brings them together lah like they say it's err every singaporean son's journey right so
it's something that uh helps
maybe it helps me feel closer to my parents if not my dad lah ya and my brother also
ya
I think for me I had
haven't haven't yet because it was still in january mah
so ya we all went
ya we only start just about I think a month apart so we're kind of in the same batch just the batch after yours lah
cause we're already went in batches then I remember that first day
my whole family follow me I think was me my
what
ya cause err I don't know people had extra then they just give me ah
so the five of us just went in together then
so obviously it was a western wednesday that they even there was a
what it was a tuesday I think ya or monday lah ya
and one of the worst workout days
ah first thing I went back to bunk ah I just
like wah what am I doing
far away from my family in in awhile lah doing something that
I didn't uh explicitly choose to do lah
let's just put it like that
ya
ya but then I think compared to
my batch my batch didn't exactly get the
full experience cause uh we didn't get to at
marina bay you know that whole err walk
across east coast and all that walking together then
going through all the tiredness all the fatigue together
carrying everything back I mean we
didn't manage to do that lah but because my batch was more like
we just ended up at the parade square then we just there
then we call it a day then we went home
although we lost that bit of it I think
since my batch was longer I got really close to my
friends lah and some of them they had followed me all the way to my new unit also which is
quite good lah then we'd be even closer ya
ah the most recent batch they did twenty four
err oh changi food food center right east coast east coast food center ya
but
I mean it's all about that um
encouragement and that feeling of like you know you are finally finishing
of like that journey right so
I think is I mean they give it to you all lah ah you finished
ya that nine weeks of then you just
I mean you feel good about yourself lah
like before you go into your unit or your next phase of training ah
ya
yes
I mean it's not for everyone lah bro
oh ya ya that's true
mm
okay
okay
mm
okay I think this kind of thing is like at first I was also wondering why then that's when I really started to
I spend my money on lah so you know the money that I get I just
it's already like this much
then it's like I feel like ya it's easier what I mean taking is cheaper
but time is definitely of the essence in this case cause I always want to
what book out early book in late ah ya so
what
oh the the amount of money I spend on
transport err food
and then after that err miscellaneous stuff they are like things that you just have to spend money on let's just say
err
going to like gift shop or the emart
to buy army supplies so these kind of things
it gets err what you call that you don't really think about it lah
at first glance then there comes the
other things that you don't need but you want lah
so that's when you really need to be more
mm
mm
honestly correct correct um ah
mmhmm
ya lah
slightly more lah ya you don't save
ya
but I think it's the this time is the perfect like opportunity for you to
you're really getting um
that taste of financial freedom
especially on your on your own right so you really can decide what you want to do with your money
ya sometimes ah I understand
like what you said lah like when I first got it also I was like wah I'm actually finally getting money then I end up
all the useless useless things that I don't really need
but then I want to buy cause I
finally have the
capability to buy them you know
ya then that's when I
err I started like really writing down everything cause I was wondering
where all my money went
ya then then then you realize err actually
there's a lot more that you can do with your money and one thing that
people are doing now is that they're really making their money work for them lah
come on especially right so with all the investing and all that
ya which
which I'm not so sure how it works I'm going to be honest but
ya I think everyone is just putting their money in it then they're waiting for the results now lah
because it will determine whether they earn money or lose money lah
ya
mmhmm
ya
ya I think I mean
I understand lah maybe this generation is
the the mindset is a lot more different I guess certain extend it's like it's more towards like
err a lot a lot more people from our generation are thinking ahead
as as compared to err trying spending their money lah feeling that
I mean trying to err not to say like enjoy now lah
but err saving the money for retirement per se
that kind of thing or for their further studies and all that
I feel that
more of us are more aware of what our
our future is like
you know and what how much we need
for our for us to like live a better life in the future lah ya so that we can always err
like help our family out lah or
at at the least like help ourselves out and not be a burden to others lah
ya so more of us are becoming more financially aware
and more
and hopefully financially stable lah
ya
mmhmm
four lah four
ya okay
mm ya
ya lah ah ya I understand where you come from lah
ah ya
mm
I think for for our generation it is like
ah no as in from what I've seen they're still
I think some people are from especially my seniors lah
since they're all what you call that ah
cause you know that that err we have that break routine um
when once you then the start school then they go overseas all that spend all their money right
then when you start uni then you really feel the crunch but you
don't have enough money lah for yourself
ya then
because of that you don't really get to
err fully enjoy your your life I guess
because you think about it let's just say you
spend all your money in one shot you don't get to spend it like
err throughout
I mean throughout your university before you actually like
get like a stable job lah
ya and I guess the purpose of
really like gives you that a bit of a headstart for you to have err financial independence ah
and um do what you want with it lah
mmhmm
uh huh yes
ya
ya
what was my plan right for investing I think for me it's not so much about um investing but
uh what uh I want to do is that
I guess it for the next year I will try to get a scholarship lah that's something I would like to work towards to lah
spending I'd definitely want to do it myself
and for the uni fees all that I really
how to say ah they like what you've said they've been supporting you whole life like maybe it's time you really take things into your own hands ah
ya and really just err be more
independent ya
but then if that doesn't work out whoa
maybe I might even consider signing on lah
cause okay if you think about it it's a
it's uh realistic it's realistic it's worth especially um
err you don't spend money as much
definitely because food okay realistically food is provided for by the cook house
okay I won't say it's amazing
ya it's acceptable lah ya and it's like
basically food outside is nicer but I mean I can't complain what
right so ya and then you the more time you spend inside
you don't spend so much money outside and then because of that you can save more
and because you can save more you can do more money with your money outside
right then
I guess by extending our contract you already give yourself a headstart of going into like
a tertiary education ah or in my case I guess uni lah so
by doing that really
um provides me with an excess of cash that
allows me to
okay so where were we ah
I think was about being like um financially independent and
being able to spend your money the way you want to but at least
ya I think that's what more things are
are things people my age are noticing becoming more
err responsible in that particular aspect of their live lah
which I think is definitely a good step ahead
if you think about it lah because everyone is um
how to say it's not about
mm not wanting to accept help from your parents but it's about wanting to really
being able to err
take your ah carry your own weight ya and really err feel the sense of um
what you call that of that reality you know that your parents have might should have led you from lah over these past few years lah
ya definitely lah
can we talk about food now amshar please
okay
ya I don't know how we ended up talking about and all
ya eh so amshar ah what's your favourite food
huh
ya
I think what's your favourite food
ya
the what
oh oh scone scone
ya
of course halal most important bro
ya
I think for me it's not about
having a favourite food but because eat I don't know I feel like eating for me is always a reason for me to socialize
no ah like it's something that helps me
people around me that I know
and I talk to so
eating is more of a social thing to me rather than
being um
ya for the taste of it lah and
that's why when I eat I don't necessarily
have any err preference of what I want to eat I just only generally ask what people like to eat then I just go eat there
ya so
for me if you ask me what's my favourite food I like comfort food lah
comfort food
hajjah maimunah bro hajjah maimunah expensive bro
okay
is booming is booming
no that's not even
then I remember bought um
eight dollars for one head
wah that was like ridiculous man
so
okay the business is booming
definitely because there are people that love that kind of food
and obviously I like it lah ya but you cannot eat it too much and too often
ya
bro it doesn't help that the food is like delicious
ya
a'ah
okay lah okay so we're talking wait ah so I was as I was saying right so let's just say
but if you ask me about my favorite food right I know I feel like
a strong inclination towards ban mian
ban mian
soup is like really something that wah I feel like ah tom yum also but tom yum is definitely maggi for me bro
ya like if I eat tom yum right the maggi one it just hits different lah I think
would definitely be instant noodles
then it's also quite easy to make lah then like that I also don't have to what
err wake up the whole family to cook right
so I just cook on my own and then just and then it's a sharing thing also
so you don't always don't just cook maggi one person
let's cook maggi for more
cause your ya
like then
it goes back to a social thing
ya I mean it's like food is not just about
err for sustenance per se but it's all about um
looking out for others also
no then I guess that's what can really bring people together also lah
ya
okay lah
just feel that just taste of food in your mouth ah
oh swimming lessons ya ya ya I remember that time
oh ya we'll stand outside the the convenience shop and then we just
wah I think now is like really the best lah
wah is that wah then the keep brings back memories so like
like what you said lah I think it's a it's a
is in
ya
back then we ate a lot less ya
oh bulking season bro
ya
ya
oh ya
I think eh two I remember when
ya when when I was studying for A levels right I don't my I don't know cause when I was in J one
my weight was sixty five kilo
ya it's like I went up by about fifteen or so in like a year
because I was just stressed out from studying A levels lah and food was something that gave me comfort lah
ya cause okay cause you think about it right you can't
so right
so cause the moment I'm eating means I'm not studying
correct so I'll I'll just eat like I'll eat a lot so like
feeling lah ah ya lah so
that that that the break time right was really very precious lah
so obviously you try to extend it as much as possible because of that I ate so much
then I just well just studying eating studying eating studying eating then what it said it was eating
not say purely for sustenance ah but so you don't feel so bored
cause the moment you're studying err the moment you're eating you are taking a break from all your books all that
then you get you that is quite boring lah
ya so I feel like
that time was a
it was a good time that I just ate the same type of food everyday
that's ridiculously unhealthy
ya but I didn't mind it
mmhmm
then after that go back to study again
ya it's it's like the same cycle everyday
mm
mm
ya but I I I think I
for me personally I cannot forget the school canteen food yet
the what I remember cause cause coming from our school was like
um what you call that there's very remember there's only what two halal stalls is it
there was only two halal stalls so the options for the muslim students were not really that much also lah
ya so it's like
ah they had they had the only they for the roti prata which is like not even allowed
oh so fucker level and the food was so good
ya
ya then we'll buy that was a definitely a secret menu item
then when people started looking eh bro what's this ah what's this then after that
then we all start everyone started ordering and then there was this err
it was like wah really if I go eat there again that would definitely bring back memories ah
ya
and
that's that's that's that's the thing lah because
food was
what like bond us together cause the only time we met each other right definitely was at the canteen
ya and there's only reason one reason you're at the canteen it's either you're skipping lectures or you're eating something
and most of more often than not we'll be eating something
ya I mean if you're awake lah
that's a
prerequisite
uh
eh but speaking of food right do you cook
ya lah
ah yes
it's such a millennial thing to do to use an air fryer
you know it's really not that much healthier in my opinion it's like uh you're still cooking it in fat
but it's just it's own fat
ya okay so I guess if you ask me I mean
ya wah that was a absolute err logistic nightmare
this one can make forty then come out wah twenty five pieces only then I was like what you want me to do
obviously I it's my first time again
ya then
obviously that's terrible right so I had to make like two to three batches if I'm not wrong
um wet
then I have to oh err ask my mum eh what to do what to do then my mum also not really a baker
fair so like okay so we figured out okay alamak just add more flour lah that kind of thing so it's like it makes it more
err usable lah ya then experiment that's when
you really figure out like eh actually it's a lot more feeling than to actually
err know the exact quantities of what you need to use cause you given the humidity and all that it all the that kind of thing plays a part
temperature of your surroundings
ya you don't think about that and your recipe doesn't tell you about that also
ya
I mean ya lah ya lah
but as a new cook all these all these kind of things are definitely out of your control what
some came out nice some came out cracked then you like eh why
so I end up eating the cracked ones the nice ones I give away lah
ya so I don't know that's just quite fun lah I remember I'll go to everyone's house
then err slowly drop off one by one
and you know uh
ya I dodged his mum so I I stay in the
that trip was just for you bro
that's quite nice also lah ya
I mean because that time I remember it was
cause it was the COVID thing
no no uh
ya
and you had your interview
ya lah
ya you got your interview that's why I asked you to meet me at the then you're like
err err ya
is not bad not bad
ha wah the things I do huh for my friends
uh
no lah
ya
mmhmm
I generally just wanted to try baking it and see what you all thought of it lah
because obviously I cook what twenty five pieces of
so I might as well just give it away lah then the other thing you were saying about
you naturally you're helping people out on the street all that
that one is still that's still err like a blur for me because
the thing is um how to say this ah that time I help someone then he said that
actually she doesn't need my help
cause she has done this many times it's just that she's a bit slower
so at the end of the day right I also feel
but then err she knows the she can do it on her own so she doesn't
want to seem like she needs help lah
and obviously I want to respect her decision but at the same
same time ah you can't help but
notice that eh you're kind of holding up the queue lah so
I should probably make you go a bit faster lah
but then I um feel like I don't want feel like I'm undermining her effort
you know of trying to being independent
how ah
ya
yes eh definitely
mmhmm
ya
ya because ya I understand
ya
ya
because there she cannot reach understand understand ya
ya
I
mm
understand understand
ya
but at the end of the day they they know that they they need your help lah
ya there are certain things that they definitely cannot do and it's rather to
and they rather choose to avoid it lah but at the same time that's when you guys come in lah when you guys help out
I think like from personal experience um
you know that um
you have to be sensitive lah be more aware of this kind of things so this kind of issues you
you cannot say them out loud
definitely because it can hurt people's feelings
but it's something that you have to consider when you're about to help someone lah especially elderly person
ya oh my god how did it run out of topic
again by so far
okay then let's just
bring it back the thing it was about you talk about
eat eh helping your friends oh talk about friends right then you
ah then you talk about helping others on the street
ya
okay
oh my goodness wait where were we
ya let's just go back to food I feel like that's a good consensus okay
you know right I think in my opinion
a lot of people have this misconception that
sedap then if it was not halal
I think
ya
ya
okay definitely ya
mmhmm
hmm
okay
no I'm not I'm not talking about that I'm talking about more is like err more to being uh okay being like
the
ya in general in general ya because because the
the amount of food that we can eat right is definitely there's definitely a restriction
so in a certain sense you'll feel like eh you're
how how do I say this mm like when you go out with your group of friends
then you just see you're the only muslim guy there the only practising muslim guy there who needs to eat halal food
to a certain extent you feel like you're doing slight inconvenience
that they have to go eat at a halal restaurant I think this is a
it's a it's a it's a known thing lah huh
cause like let's just say eh err
let's go eat ah din tai fung you know obviously that's a no go for me
um make us feel bad so they will just err go to somewhere we can eat lah
and end up we go to the same place every single time
eighteen chefs bro eighteen chefs is the go to bro
ya then
at the end of the day it's like
these food options they are still there but
just that it's it's err slightly limited lah
according to what we eat and and I don't know I have to admit from what I've noticed that
um let's just say you're eating halal food obviously different cultures have
um
halal versions of their food also and a lot of people are doing that
but these tends to be more expensive
than usual
like okay then in my opinion let's just say you go uh there's a lot of cheap ramen stalls
ya lah let's just say ramen stalls but they're not halal
cheaper ramen stalls but then for the halal versions of these kind of stalls right I think a lot of prices are quite expensive and
ya because they're halal and there's definitely a demand for it
so I feel that to a certain extent this is not fair
and then when we go as a group also then wah the obviously the receipt be quite expensive lah
then it's not fair to them because there's like offers on like
other shops and all that
so it's it's more about the variety I think that's the issue here
ya but then again I don't want to restrict my friends from not eating pork you know what I mean
ya like okay I'm I'm definitely fine with you eating pork but it's like
ya it doesn't affect me it's just it's just a personal stand when I see it's like
I don't want to make them feel paiseh also
ya what you want to eat
so I guess what
they I mean they say don't mind lah but sometimes like what I've have done is that
I just go and sit somewhere there also lah but I don't eat also
ya just sit in and then you just
talk lah because at the end of the day like eh actually it goes back to the same point where
for me eating right is more of a socializing
thing rather than actually having to eat because I can eat anytime bro at home there's always food
ya there's always that ice cream container inside with
ya with no ice cream and not what you call that uh but I've no no what's that err
that's it's like ya and it's never
what the neopolitan one ah
ya eh that's definitely a piece of your childhood right there
ya okay
then I think if you like going back to that point right it's like
I don't know ah there's no solution for this it's just something I felt like talking about
take to the edit ah there certain definitely there certain places with
a higher concentration of halal food as compared to other places lah
ah like okay I meant bugis paya lebar or bugis bro
so many halal food there and but it's definitely more like cafes and all that
so it's definitely on the more expensive end
that kind of stuff ya that's the easy option
and they don't mind but I tell you I can't eat prata every single day bro
prata is not I can't live on prata bro ya
mm uh mm
ya
ya definitely
especially here especially here
yes no actually that's why I think it's a good thing that
the government is like trying to push for using more healthier ingredients and you can see this a lot in
they've err they're slightly no update okay it's very obvious
obvious and uh they're slightly cringey
err what you call that national err health promotion board ah
what you call they try to insight
healthier choice references into like certain malay jamaahs right
err coconut milk and all that right
so when you see this kind of thing it's like okay obviously they are pushing for it so that people
will like oh actually there's healthier versions of this kind of food that we can eat then you can actually eat more of it lah and
to a certain extent the taste will change a bit but for the most part it'll be the same lah
like cause it's still the same dish mah
ya and
like what I said it is definitely not obesity diabetes is definitely a big problem
like ya huh so
hmm
I think but to be honest is
I wouldn't think it's from our generation it's all the older generation mostly because
the the diet has and will always be consist of err will always comprise of
that lah of that kind of traditional food
definitely definitely you can change bro but uh you have to understand the
mindset and the
practice of someone who's err older right it's definitely something very difficult to
err change or enforce it's it's definitely it's definitely it's like
it has to come in like very slow stages lah
ya
ah yes yes yes
ah bro then when the teh O is like what three scoops of three bold scoops of sugar
eh ya understand
but they don't
ya and and I can understand where they're are going from we've been doing this our whole life why should we change
ya they're still okay and it tastes ya ya definitely I agree ya
ya ah that's why they cook the nicest food
but you definitely cannot go there and eat there every single week
they're having that's that's just too much
no we my my family makes it a point that we just bring our own food there so they don't cook
so we bring when we bring our food we tell them in advance and then we bring like healthier food lah
so the
but we only go there every week lah
that's when we are all are free mah cause if we go there that's when the whole family is together
so we can go there every weekend lah or so
ya so
ya
also
to a certain extent because okay imagine like
err this kind because like I mean uh for
so she definitely want to try new food also
then like because certain things that she cannot cook
especially like it's quite cool lah that's because she likes
to she doesn't mind eating sushi you know japanese food she doesn't mind anything
which is quite sick and this this this tends to
how do I say this I think it tends to be healthier
I mean especially like sashimi like that kind of stuff
ya I think sashimi is definitely healthier bro
it's just fish right so ya so we bring it over
mmhmm
ya lah
I mean
I think by a long shot but ya
and sashimi is not with rice so on it's own already
ya ya lah
so like going back to that is
like when we bring we come over we'll bring food right so she doesn't
it's not that she doesn't have to cook because she insists that she definitely makes family lah because
so the guests feel I mean it's something that they hold to lah quite close lah
she prepare less lah
ya so that's that's a good thing that's a good start
I mean ya but I think ya okay
straying off topic again one of the unhealthy things that I will always look for to err weekends is definitely bubble tea ah
I don't know I'm a bubble tea kind of guy man it's like
what's your stand what's your stand
ya
it's a social thing social thing again
so you're peer pressured into buying it
chocolate eh
ah
oh so oh you're more of that old school bubble tea lah so you're talking about the oreo crush that kind of ice blended drinks is it
so I mean this brings back memories bro okay actually that's the thing because last time right
and then got err sweet
I don't know man it just closed bro so
I remember it was what oreo crush will be like two dollars
in fact it was I think something it was less than two dollars then you you upsize it
huh
ya you upsize it to two fifty or three dollars
then now you wah you take a look at all the
standard bubble tea shops one cup is like three dollars lah at least
or like or student card
okay which is not legal by the way
so it's like it's still then that's when it becomes like two dollars or even one fifty something like that
ya
I mean I I think I think about it that
these kind of things is
it's something that you enjoy on the weekends lah something like you don't really have all the time so
I think it's okay cause in camp you're definitely just drinking water
some other thing
dude I think I'll be I'll go crazy
definitely ah my money you will just disappear on poverty
okay I understand extend the contract lah you mean
ya bro I haven't considered signing on bro
ya
especially you'll be in a situation where you'll be more aware of your finances
ya
okay ya lah ya lah definitely lah I mean there's still a lot of ways to fill up your time
I forgot more beneficial if before starts
is easy it's an easier role ya you know what's going on
I think like
if you
like if you about about the food thing right let's just say
even though
you spend money like buying food outside and all that at the end of the day it would be better if you end up cooking
learning how to cook on your own because it's definitely a useful skill ya it's a skill that you should have in for your life because
at some point in your life you'll definitely be living alone
right obviously you also know that
that's not very sustainable so
if you want to eat something else lah
but this kind of thing is
definitely up to you
and up to your own preference ah
but
how you how you how you feel about that
ya I agree with you

hello shita how are you
how long did you get here
huh
oh okay it's okay lah
ya so I was like giving birth to a baby I don't know
yes I was alone in the hospital I don't know who was there also

no I still don't want have the baby I don't want
ya
like what
oh ya ya better I can help you

ya it's a skill ya singing is a skill seh
it's not you don't really need like talent
ya there's this

ya ya definitely
why not
okay so
ya that's very good lor
look girl got the red
it's only twenty six minutes
sixty minutes
wow actor ah
actor
hmm thinking of my favourite
err
I don't know why like on top of my head is johnny depp for some reason because he's very versatile
ya
ya but then I don't want to go through the abuse
ya that's true that's true that's true
but I just said why what thus
because he's such a versatile actor but if it was a young actor maybe I want to be number five
so handsome
oh I'm a sixteen year old boy
ya
elek elek
is it his singing career
booboos like what
oh but ya ya he's still teenager
oh
all so just jealous of him lor he's very good sia
yes
but to me it's just like okay lah
yes
no that that video makes me think like yes he is still a kid
oh I didn't know that people were like bullying him
ya encouragement ah yes if I were him I wouldn't care lah of what people say like ah whatever I want to sing
normal yes
wow why am I not surprised
mm ya
oh ya I heard about that
ya yes
wow awesome sia better than mine sia
ya
wow
ya so petty
ya
ya
that's great
wow I'll be young again but then I'll have like my life set out already
like dance rap but then if I were to wake up as me in their body I think cannot
that's so
a'ah
wow
huh work
at all
not go work but um ah
I don't know leh I feel like we will like
go back to how we were
ya we would have to like make our own food you know farm or whatever right it's still kind of like work
but maybe it means
oh like a depression ah
wah man I don't know man
ya I think will be like if you don't need money to survive right do you have other means
it's like a dystopian game
if it were me I will just sleep
but if you don't have to go to work
so be anything lah whatever people need lah
ah you give me food and I'll give you a hug how about that
okay what is it must listen first if kiss can kiss on the cheek
but please I hungry if not I just kill you lah
but that's an interesting question though I can't imagine ah cause it's too far far fetched already
but you realise or not like apocalypse themed movies like singapore don't do that imagine in singapore context we do that I don't know how it's going to be
ah that's true lah
ya
but apocalypse in singapore I don't know sial
how is it going to be
of course not lah it's like gradual
ya
ya ya ya
but I feel like if ever lah got apocalypse in singapore I think all the races will finally get together and will not think about actually being coloured
ya like
come on sis
extinct
ya ya ya ya
what's the question again
I think
I mean based on what I see in the news and all that I think err global warming
would ya either we drown or we will run out of food like there's no more resources left that's how ya we become barren lah
which is like most likely but imagination wise I don't know leh
oh because of the pandemic now
ya ya ya ya
that's my legs
spread ah
oh
ya
ya we already cut oh wow
no
bridge
um break down
wow how convenient sia
ah
swordfish
ya
wow
so like trump
ah
we'll be the last to die
our import export don't have already how
lose oh okay obvious at each country or ya because it's like humans were extinct rhino hope right ya lah so no choice lah actually depressing
lose weight
ya
yay
I feel like we'll extinct it will be because of a flu like we will sneeze too much until we get dehydrated and die
hopefully not lah eh now already COVID it's so scary
err work ah
eh
but something you already hate right like something
oo everyday activity
that is torture yes
that's torture that's too much
is it
oo that's like work seh babe
oh this is a game
ya lah
I think eating for eight hours is a torture also that's like why would you do that but
exercise normally already torture
exhaustion
sial lah chores for eight hours
ya ya ya
therapeutic
okay then maybe not
I want to say sleeping but then
I cannot torture myself lor
so many things
why I rather die
ee that's sick
hello
I know I want to be able to make someone have diarrhoea
if I don't like the person it's okay no need to say anything just like diarrhoea
ya they won't they won't think it's me also
ya and then you can it can happen anytime you want
see the ghosts because I'm like
claus like can make them do much for me
ya lah but I'm also depressed so I feel like I can lah
that's true lah hi
I'll just make I'll just make them a K-pop group ah then okay go around and stray kids
ya I think that's the side effect of his power ah
ya I think ghosts more than people
but then why you say that you want to see ghosts is it
ya but your super power
ya
most of them are quite bullshit lah but the one the real ones like
oh
ya ya my friend like that also but the fake ones I like because
they quite consistent but
is like why why must you do this all the time like
it's a guy ah

while basically you guys will be cleaners for the last months
why
sunrise ya we have to clean we have to
yes you have to clean after every practical after every practical
it make sure it's clean make sure it's clean and dry then make sure once the chef comes back he touch the table and there's
but we only clean the inside of the classes which is quite big lah because is a kitchen what is a kitchen so it's quite big
what do you mean ugh huh it's a horrible mess man
ya is it no his
the the worst part is when
the flour is like flying a lah
wait ah
the flour is around the floor
is what
meaning
always always like dirty up nursing and will everyone have this err what apparently apparently
no my class didn't had any emperor
mm mm no it's just that we love a certain parts let's say some of us do not like to mop some of us do not like to watch them on him what's and bends south as doesn't like
ya even though it's already a college we have a prefect everyday so
is a monitor so no this monitor job right everyday is a different person is a different person everyday
uh okay today ah
we going to learn this and this and this and after the class today right now ah
will do this thing this thing this thing so that's what the monitor everyday does it we call it I'm not wrong we call that
why ah
mmhmm
no okay but see that's the different for you you got their position because you really wanna do you really want to have their position
you wanted that position
see
see basically you wanted to lead something right
okay
but you okay I'm talking about the lead part okay not talking about the pay
so that's the difference like I do not want to lead
good morning good morning
um ya but then
oh okay okay okay okay now next person go
because even though like um
and then
which one which one
oh is it I have two
ya
balance it at ang mo kio I feel so stupid
what
that's why I say I feel so stupid
yes ya I agree you are welcome no because back then
I was like okay because I wanted to be a nurse you see everything so I want ah
this those or that
ya nurse at see me so I apply see me I didn't get then after somewhere else at bally's
the school is horrible sia so so big like super big like if your class is at
that's it your break time lunch time that's it you got no space to eat everytime everyone come ready sit ready got no space
but at least you have a recognise diploma
mm
but one thing that I find
um very sad lah about my life is that I have diploma but it doesn't work
basically it's useless which
P B S eh
no sound about that can you can you try to understand but it's not about that it it just
it's not about that I'm talking about why singapore do not accept private diploma
okay if you want to use on me okay if you want to use on me I apply for jobs using my why they don't accept me use something can use something
my is social media and web development I have photoshop I know I know coding I can get amazing jobs
yes
exactly so you cannot give me that kind of answer if you don't know the answer
I understand is err
my private diploma is only to get culinary jobs
because my private diploma is culinary
I still do study to get my diploma
okay but then that one ah you know what you forget about it you let me use my NITEC so I been applying for NITEC
from NITEC
to get money
oh ya ya ya
no lah I mean I am grateful right err singapore progress fast
okay I'm grateful for that um ya you know some of our neighbouring country is like that
okay so so I'm ungrateful for singapore being too um being able to progress very fast and so like the younger generation like us or our
all of us tau we do but we don't really have so it's like
thank god
you know thank god okay so okay lah singapore is okay lah I would say okay
ya

I'm fine thank you
how's your family
ah
ya second one is a boy right
oh I'm still looking for someone
I'm only twenty plus
oh
uh I'm not sure but I'm going to meet some friends would you like to join us
I think it um you might know them because some of them are our former ah schoolmates
oh you're into baking now wah that's nice wah must try some of your cake soon ah
okay sure but what are we going to do this weekend
ah movie but ah during this pandemic kind of hard lah because I think with the crowd control and all
wah netflix and chill ah
err I don't know uh only so far only a few have confirmed but uh
I will update you ah on the rest maybe about four five of us
ya that would be a good idea
can lah uh
will update you later so
what how
so how are your kids at school
ah
um but is it too young for them to start
um going to tuition at this age she's only six years old kan
ya
think the education system in singapore is such that err everyone is competing uh so
it's
it has its pros and cons ah like to prepare your kids but for them to
be stressed at such an early age
ya but
slowly lah but surely uh I think if your kids just study hard and
show you and your husband that
they become
this do well in school I think it's important lah they just try their best lah
and
I I do have other maybe uh I think I can ask them but I don't know how much their rates are
oh oh
orh okay okay I understand I can ask for you lah then
err we'll see what we can arrange
err
wah you sit down at coffeeshop ah I thought you atas one
oh you you full time housewife ah
good lah
actually it's better for to me lah personally I think it's good that you are taking care of your kids rather than
um like hiring a maid or something
because some I've heard of cases where maid like don't really do their job I don't know
ya I think it's costly to to get a maid to have a maid in singapore err I think err
they have levy
then when you first
I think it's quite
expensive ah then must add into your income I don't know
then I think they should also have a rest day uh some owners also like abuse their maid lah so that's not right lah I feel
ya there's uh the other few cases in singapore about maid abuse ah think they accuse maid of stealing
and some even like pour boiling water at the maid
ya I think it's on the news lah but you just have to be updated lah now with the
COVID nineteen ah I think a lot of us are restricted in so many ways
can can
can engage maid but I think it'll be the price will be higher because I think your maid have to go for check the swab test all that lah before they are cleared to do cleaning oh mm
oh must take care of your health now lah
like but I think if now if you go to any
uh I think if your doctor if you have a slight fever or cough or sneeze think they will give you like five days and ask you to monitor
ya lah for those who are working lah they will give you like
to check on yourself
err so that that because they don't want this to spread
around right
ah
uh alhamdulilah so far
I'm okay lah maybe
got
headache
migraine maybe because insufficient rest uh because of work ah
um politic lah then you got a lot of new things and we have to do the what uh
safety measure measurement at work mm cause yes
now currently we have this installation uh of doraemon at the national museum it's interesting lah but
unless I'm there lah then I can maybe give you special
special queue
ya december holidays
ah
uh
uh claim it
oh usually you go to johor ah and do your shopping
I think so far our government has done well lah to control ya ya cause if not think like in the like getting worse
mm
oh
ah so it's like
uh they have different sizes lah and
uh they cater also for kids
mm
mm
ya true
ya
ya but surprisingly
I think they are currently
preparing ah for phase three to roll out but ya lah depends also on I think
as singaporeans
to be on alert lah it's important lah for us to be on alert
ah foot locker to buy some adidas shoe that was launched ya I don't know that if there was a
crowd control measurement that
mm
ya lah
mm
you know
stay home notice ya
and I think uh for those who are coming in I think
uh they need to do the swab test daily I'm not sure ah I'm not sure how it works exactly ya but they are required lah eh even when they come in they have to do the swab test lah
ah
ya thankfully
a
mm yes yes
uh I think the hired or those who were inexperienced or did not have
proper work
can undergo training before they can do the uh the conduct the test
was mm asked to leave I think he got a job as a security lah err and considered is also a high risk because err he's taking care
of
those who are
quarantined in the dorm uh
but actually they're paying quite
high lah is about fifteen dollars per hour
ya
ya I think
ya they have to put on the the personal protective equipment which consists of the gown the mask the goggles all that lah because they don't want to
be in contact ah ya don't want to be exposed to this uh and even when he he's finished his job think he ask uh his family to prepare like a bucket of water with soap so that he can uh remove his clothes outside his house uh ya
but actually before he go back so he already shower at the at his workplace lah so it's just an
additional steps ah precaution ya
ah
ya you see
ah so it's not easy ah it's quite
ya I think ya the government
our government has taken like
a few cartons eh I think at home then now they are like selling the mask
but sometimes I think ya
it's best to be safe lah
got some quality is not that good ah
ya but for kids you can actually buy for them
the specially designed mask ah
think they will if they like something they will probably wear it longer
ya but
no lah I think you should the government issuing masks for
the ones that are washable I think still can still can last lah err for a few months then but you have to
wash lah I think you have a few and the ones that recyclable then just are reuse lah
mm
err according to the
safety measurement I think
mm
ya can okay lah that's an idea but
ya with this COVID I think
you just need to
mm
ah three kan mm
mmhmm
mm
feels also quite sad lah for those who have a family like they suddenly like thought that the airline industry is like like iron fist or something ah but now look what happened
ya I think
ya having a pay cut
it's also bad lah but it's better than not having no job and all lah ya because you still have a family have bills to pay ya
ya lah
ya lah it's tiring lah even my friend who used to work at the museum he's now uh doing grab but grab is also affected err think there was once during the circuit breaker period I think he
send the car back because he couldn't pay the rental only after phase two only he uh took back the car ya but still it's not doing well lah he has to work about fourteen to fifteen hours to cover rental uh
to the family lah
mm true lah I think
the government implementing a lot of err help for those
need them ah they also I think they have set up this um united where they can have families the elderlies and those who are you need lah ya
because I think
quite a lot of singaporeans affected by this and like
think since march ah I think know and now it's like coming to the end of the year and we haven't like got a proper vaccine to counter this ya you know the other day and another friend of mine about india india actually came up with a vaccine
ya it's quite scary but hopefully ya lah things will get better lah think I think for singaporean ah they the
this is still contained and hopefully there won't be anymore new cases ah that can affect us
prata
uh there's a prata at sin ming I think it's quite nice it's run by a family uh father and a son
can can um
can ah maybe I want to try eat the briyani ah
the briyani is quite nice ah I think the chicken
very soft very tender ya I think compared
to other places I think that's one of the best ah
err what do you want to order I help you order
the briyani or the prata coin is also nice
and it's
I think just the right
taste ah
can
uh I think I eat briyani with uh fried chicken lah mm because the chicken today they fry just nice to my liking ah
then what drinks do you want
teh peng teh peng
teh with ice eh
ya but I think is not that good to always drink teh with ice ice
then you can just order mineral water think it's better lah at this I think for us at this times we must really take care of our health err and also see what eat we eat
ah and also see what we eat
okay
can
uh
anything else
wah there's a lot of people in the queue
ya
digital
uh you order lah since you are very good using app
um briyani chicken
ya fried chicken
mm
ah yes
oh so we have to pick up or
oh okay oh that's
ya I understand but err I volunteered with err an organisation that is helping the elderly like to buy food err to buy groceries so that they will minimize err their movement outside ah so they can actually err contact us and have like medication
uh you can buy for them and then send it to their homes um
ya lah I think it's a long way to help our seniors uh
because I think if they are exposed to this I think um probably they're they're prone because their immune system not as strong as before
no this is uh I think done by government agencies ah they they set up to help out the elderly the seniors uh so that they will not be exposed much ah so as and when they need help they just contact the agencies ah then we will be there to send groceries medication uh food
ya I think is yup
I think you can volunteer lah through the organisation I will give you a contact person so that maybe can ask eh for more information lah ya
um
free ah
mm
ya
communication
is
mm
mm
ya lah
data
mm
oh the air bubble for hong-kong ya I also heard that but ya
think it takes a lot of effort ah to go back like we were normal I think this is the new normal ah
mmhmm
ya lah
mm
ya think
when it gets better I think we have to follow the
safety measurement ruling ya there's a lot of new policies that they will come up with and we just have to abide lah
ah
the social distancing ah
mm
mm
ah social distancing ambassador
mm
ah

oh but then again cause I'm not keeping up with the new ones
what is it about
okay okay

ya that genre is is I mean that's my favourite genre which is shonan
ya
okay
okay
ah
explode
a'ah ah
okay strength
okay
oh okay wow
I thought I thought you were gonna say set stuff on fire remotely because that
because pyrokinesis is
but no one else has powers
mm

ha so he just hears his voice in other people's heads
so people think he's stupid
oh my god
okay okay okay

three episodes how do you watch three episodes
right oh you skip you skip the
you don't you skip the intro and ending right
huh serious ah
how many episode is it
oh you mean like each season got twenty something episodes chey
no I'm asking total
okay okay sorry sorry
it's okay
slice of life is one thing that I never really got into
ya ya ya
right cause you have to be super fantastical
actually I want to see I don't like it to be close to reality but my favorite gundam series are the ones that are closest to reality so
what do I really like
watching can see right on kids central
drama
drama
you just don't want everybody watch
mm
it's our like childhood in that
right
ya that's the one everybody watch
it's our like childhood
fantasy lah like
like you know brings us together
that's rude
that's not how it's not how this works that's not how any products
bro no
that's not how that's not how this works that's not how any of this works
ya like everybody has like a weird love hate relationship with that series
hmm
actually no that that timeline the the plot was okay
ya
although it did start lah it did spur it it started my my thing for gundam so okay fine fine I give you that bandai
and then like you grow and then you watch it and you're just like what was I thinking
ya okay lah fun
hmm
ya
yes so how did it go
hmm
she's like tall she's so tall
hmm
right right
I really hope the posters get restocked though
did you take the stuffs
oops
huh
ya
which the bracket in singapore
ya
ya
bracket in singapore oh okay she knows eh
wow
they're so savvy I swear I feel like I need to be on reddit but I'm just like I I don't like I don't like the format of forums
threads and stuff
mm
mm
so like you know and they have like really topics that you don't want to say like unexplained incline buttons bitcoin as long as you need to you in a here
oh ya ya ya ya
ya that's the thing that's the thing I've I've just heard it heard about it like in terms of it being a cesspool of negativity
ya so
mm
ya ya ya
okay
oh ya ya
I've seen it on twitter yes
really weird ya
ya ya
comments lah
ya
correct ya ya
ya
sassy ah
ya
ya
but ya actually I asked uh najhah about it like how many episodes is it actually it's not that many eh
maybe at most twenty plus lah but that's what I was very confused because the way people talk about it right is is as though it's already reached the same level as much as naruto and all that with like five hundred and two seasons eh three seasons eh in all that kind of
so that ya but the craze my god
that's that's the awkward thing because actually like I said just now the japanese narrative is twelve
cause it's in the credits ya so it's like ya
society knows
I guess ya lor like like that suicide and like like depictions of god and stuff I don't know
there's the tag they real put one canon typical violence

you cannot even think of three wishes and you want so many other wishes
nevermind I don't want to know
I wish that I'm not married

I wish that I am smart as fuck
so that I don't need to study for my exams
and then I wish that the cat

like after they poo they will scoop up the poo and throw it in the dustbin
and done

oh
oh no yesterday aman and I were at vivo there we saw this shop called face resizer then you can do that ah
you need to resize the face
collect money collect money hooray
okay you need hundred sessions
unlimited sessions
mm
my superpower is to control the cat
like for example they pee or poo I will I will tell them go and clean up
ya that's controlling the behaviour
same what control is demand
no my poor babies no way
K my superpower is
or rather the superpower that I want is to be able to read without feeling tired
noob sia we will make horrible superheroes seh
err
err I cannot
what
teleport
with a snap
I think so
err
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
ee
why
no I I don't think buttercup will want to be with you
you smack it
like how you smack alias
ya pad thai
pad thai from magic wok
ee want to go and eat the nuts
mm
good looks or a fit body
for your partner
I don't have both
hmm
okay so good looks ah
K good looks
ya lah I want to ask now lah so choose first
good looks or fit body
K
good looks or personality
then
ya lah something like etol lah you cannot say that he has good looks what
siala
I told you I didn't want that
I told you what
there's a possibility that
um
mm
mm
I would prefer
oh okay okay uh good looks
but smelly as hell
or ugly but smells good
but the ugly is like damn ugly
like
K lah I feel so bad for saying people ugly
but like the eyes like
the distance between each eyes is like right
you can wear mask what
okay err
the the ugly ah
why
hello I'm with one
I rather be with an ugly one
then with someone who stinks like shit like aman
okay err
mm
would you rather
have one million dollars
or
err
or a good job
or a job that you really enjoy doing
like everyday you wake up
you just want to go to work
and do the work
and meet your friends at work
okay lah one million dollars is
not a lot
in today's context
huh
huh
I don't understand
mm
mm I rather get the money
and then the money I will invest and then I will roll it
and then I can do what I want
which is to save all the cats in the world no lah in singapore first lah
that is not boring
I want to save all the cats in singapore
and then I'm gonna set up a cat cafe then you can make it like it's also the same as if your job is to save cats they will be looking forward for ingredients is not a job you can volunteer hit a jaw all the money you use would be for the cats and basically you don't get any money most of the cat's rescue work you don't get money ya lah what I mean is
saving cats is not a job most if it is volunteering
no the money you use will be
for the cats and uh basically you don't get any money
most the cats rescue work you don't get money cause the money
ya lah with the money then I will do that lah
I need that one million dollar first so that I can set up this cat cafe
what kind of organisation it's not a work it's not a job these
places are rescue works you don't earn anything then I don't need to live I don't need to pay bills
need to pay bills what and then the cats I rescue them and then what feed them what
ya
so I need the money so I can open up a cat cafe the people will come
and eat and drink and all the money will be given to the cats for their food
and the the unique
selling point of this cat cafe is that all the cats are
stray cats
fat why
ya lah
cause I will invest also what so my my money will come from my investment
then the remaining will be for the cats
and then the people who will work at a cafe
are those people from the low income family
your head
a non-profit organisation
huh
uh uh I cannot lah
volunteer ah
then you get to play with the cats sia so cute
bring lah
no you must keep
you know the cats so cute over there most of them are like abandoned cats
ya sia like
I am saving bubbles
for like a kitten that
or a cat that's abandoned outside
and then if you found the abandoned kitten never
then never tell
eh then nevermind lah they can be bubbles and more what
why socks

the kind of names that you want
blossom
what do you mean brighter cat

it's it's it's at least that one day one day or that twenty four hours eh is also to me an opener ah it's still fun ah it's still fun ah I mean as following tour ah so
yes
ya lah
but then again also I think it's not also about touring ah I mean you make the network but say next time you're not touring ah you just want to go for a holiday you go holiday to europe ah then you like want to meet friends you already have friends there and then they are very welcoming sometimes you even
ya so
mm mm
ya that's why
that's why that's why I mean
I think he very selective of the places he wants to go
that's why
scared sia
cause cause I know her partner is not an adventurous adventurous person ah
but ah lal recently like did like quite a
did did a few songs ah one two songs
then everybody fill in ideas lah lyric lyric wise would be dol lah cause his lyrics are actually very good
hakim fill in
melodic parts
yes correct
ah skate punk like a lot of
hakim is very propagandhi
apa at least everyone's ideas plays a part ah
confirm blast kan
oh oh farhan eh
but but
ah ya
make it sound more raw
ya more organic
can feel the difference yes ya you can feel the difference if you play single pedal and you can even feel lah you can also hear that is double ah like like there's always for me like if you play single pedal you play that double pedal sound you have you have that a bit of latency
right
I don't know ah is their style ah
but then also to say again missy shoot also playing that kind of song ah that kind of vibe ah but then
ah ya ya
ya relevant bands ah
they they they they suck life ah or they suck ah actually personally I don't listen to them already ah like rarely listen to them
penny wise will still be that sound ah cause it's still skate punk but then they always seek
err still have still around they still playing gigs
last year they release new album what
last year ah not bad lah but still the same sound ah
I like penny wise but I still prefer
ya ah professor professor sia vocalist professor siol sia
but they I think they really grow up with not the skate punk scene but they grow up with the the punk punk scene ah they grow up there
ya but like you know like like penny wise for example they all like err surfers and skateboarders mah
so but bad religion really I think raw from the streets ah but they are very intelligent people ah
tony hawk pro skater eh
no I don't like him ah
but cannot ah
but okay lah see how lah missy shoot
no but we going to jam soon cause wan G got a new bass
I don't know his brother-in-law give him
ah I forgot it's a weird shape weird shape one then he just need to redo the everything ah so he give to hakim hakim
maggot maggot ah maggot setting up for him ah then he gonna after that we jam ah
composer
all of us ah together but wan G is the one that do everything lah so
yes err so we input ideas lah ah like but but wan G will will wan G will do first lah at home then after that after he do
I don't know he ah to me it's okay lah
ya but I think along the way right he he realised something lah and then along the way he he he he discovered new sounds ya so keep discovering new stuff right
yes
yes cause the cause the feel is different already but I manage to record half the song but after that he said eh
err better ah
style ya correct
but he
ya cause you will cause when you buy new stuff you keep discovering new sounds then you you want to add you want to add but I think probably
music writing you need to be contented in some ways like okay
I got this one I discover this this new sound eh I will keep this new sound for the next one so we do with this first
then that personally for me
do it fast ah cause we delay too long already ah ah so we we we say never mind lah we we we told hakim next next time when we you know writing new songs we want to record
we do it with you ah but because we already comfortable eh and he knows our sounds we know we he knows our sounds
he we know his style so and he will give the good know the good the good stuff lah
and then he also good he he always like investing on his stuff he got a lot of stuff as in equipment he invest on vintage stuff which we like ah ah recently we went to his studio right he bought this like
ah bass man ah it I think is
but the thing is he always right he damn lucky ah I think I think he's damn lucky ah like he always find things vintage right but at a good price
ya
good sounds for the band lah
so far his recordings are actually good ah his personal his personal personal recordings is like everything that he plays himself or
he gets sessionist to play actually actually very good ah for me lah personally like like that seventies sound
ya but don't know how patient yadi is lah
cause must commit correct must commit
cause hakim is very hardworking that is his his income pe his livelihood pe
a lot a lot of bands
he he
but ya cause depends on the bands lah but from what
sia
no no no he he got another reggae band
err
comic strip play for comic strip also drummer ah ya ya ya rizal
so I think recorded there also
err even stoned revivals ah remix sound that song oh no actually stone revival re-record one of the songs but to make it err make it into malay also err I think goodil eh
ya lah but how they do it right is like err err
some parts we record it in singapore then the tracks will be sent to australia esam esam australia esam will record
err we record over then will send back then they mix then will send back again then he will do the vocals there then send back they mix here ah
ya but it also depends on him what he I don't know but
don't know ah but
I I don't know ah but but but that depends on him maybe he's comfortable using that but but okay lah I think zad also not bad not say not bad is actually he quite fast that he becomes really good ah
youtube siao he is
one thing about him right he if he into it right he really go all out ah into it ah
yes correct
but then see lah maybe maybe in future lah maybe he also looking at it
ya ya that's why
he really invest ah but one thing about zad I realised if he's really into it he will invest so if he have enough he will invest he invested on all the drums stuff
good sia cause he feels paiseh lah want to borrow people
he always borrow he like that one but people actually say nothing just use lah I mean we don't care if it breaks it breaks lah cause it's a wear and tear
ah
that's why
of course
if it breaks it breaks then what can I do cause
it's not something which is non-breakable what it's something like confirm one day it will just spoil but okay lah I mean I understand
but I know he some I mean knowing him
ya I know
ah we don't mind we don't mind we don't mind cause end of the day we are all friends like you know
I even I even told him lah if he's not recovered then missy shoot want to record then you need help to set up the mic and whatever lah run everything if ah confirm
after he recover he will take a while before he can really carry heavy stuff cause that one is a heavy impact injury lah so then
at least you know before to record we come here lah we help you to shift the whatever lah amp
ya shift the mic lah whatever then you just tell us what to do then we help you run then everything goes on cause we we willing to help cause we know you have the potential sia
you're the
go to in a way go to guy you know
err cause of what you produce ah
so we'll see lah
don't know lah
I know he he some more him being very anxious guy
err so he needs to get out
he confirm don't want
he confirm don't want
ya lah
no the thing is the no the walk that time the plan right zad was okay zad wanted to do it he injured what
ah
towards the end
is
cause the leg was giving
it's mental ah mental ah it's it is more of mental
we chill for about five ten minutes then like okay guys
no it was so crowded cause it's already weekend what then then we just walk ah so that the last one point five click right the moment we entered with we
entered like the one point five click way to punggol end coney island was like the longest four point five click we ever walk ah
ah but azil also said never mind ah we take it slow ah don't don't
don't force yourself lah you know then to give up also now is like wasted sia ya no force is force but not say don't overexert yourself ah
twenty minutes half an hour after that aisyah like okay ah then we all like come lah let's go ah hafiz waiting
ah ah
so we had to walk for one plus click ah
we had to walk for another one point five click like that like
so that was the slowest walk to punggol err settlement but actually during the walk right going like when it starts to get really morning right
ah
siao
ah ah
oh there the park connector ah
go to coastal
east coast
it's wrong coastal the coastal tanah merah coastal one whole stretch is about twenty plus clicks
ya so ya lah but don't know ah but we want to dragon we want to do it again you make another good talk about I think this time with you go right we we go that route but we whatever we can cut regard ah
so ya lah but don't know but we want to try again we want to do it again
whatever we can cut we cut ah no lah but
yio chu kang sengkang cannot ah must go that way no actually right
oh cannot cannot cause that park connector is the nearest if not you will go further
the buangkok is the nearest to reach ah but that one is also quite a stretch ah
ah ah but but is like you walk walk eh park connector park connector then you see eh sengkang already
the other end then you go in front another bridge oh that's the McDonald's the stadium that is the end of sengkang
then you go to punggol so that from punggol the whole stretch you walk you thought like okay ah this one near already you walk walk walk suddenly it's just sumang
so that sumang is the end the beginning of that sumang is like the end middle of punggol lah that sumang
it still have a long stretch before you reach the end
so there's another route ah so there's another route to walk
but we see lah we try again ah
we see next time maybe end of the year lah okay lah K K K

ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay what is it
ya
oh
so this will be your third wish lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
the first thing I'm thinking about being rich of course everybody think about being rich right
because being rich you don't need to even think about like uh
you got momey problem anything right because you already rich what
you if you like like what you say become a billionaire right once I become a billionaire I'm also going to buy a house a car
for um
is benefit for myself and my family lah
so we can bring whole family go shopping together ha
car is actually benefit for us to go everywhere lah
when you got a big family right it's much easier
ah rather than now that we having difficulties okay like emergency we want to go
anywhere also we need to book a grab at least if we got our own car at least we can drive
straightaway and bring
I mean like something happen uh we can bring our parents or maybe we can bring our siblings or
touch wood lah eh if anybody
ah emergency at least we got car
we can drive straightaway to the hospital
ah so we can save for the ambulance money so we don't need to pay the ambulance at least we save the money so once you think about money ha
everything about money lah eh
because although once you being rich you still think about money ah that is why
then after I bought everything then after everything stable then my second wish is I want to have a baby
uh stable financial eh
ride their own bicycle to school ah kan
so from there also safe you see everything think about money eh
I already think very far lah kan
ya
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
then after that
ah you say that you read about the news kan
ah but like what
two months' time right about two months' time so okay lah not bad lah
so why not then
so at least if we can use that uh one hundred uh dollar voucher lah
we can save up money save up some money lah
to buy our own food cook our own food so we just picnic
mm
uh huh
mmhmm
ya correct
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
um you know that uh
that's why I suggest if we book hotel we can ask the hotel management
to do the birthday party for us
because later they they will tell us how much everything altogether
ah they will serve okay you having what event right then you say like birthday party it's just a small birthday party
you can say if not like
you just say it's a surprise birthday party so they will create for you so you no need to deco they will deco for you lah
so at least from they maybe we save up or if you really think that it's not save so you
you suggest uh maybe we like what you suggest just now you say what
we buy at daiso kan
mm so like that better right
mm
ya ya correct correct
they have they do have
why not
err
ya lah marina is nice ah
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
splash
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think that one is quite cheap also
because um that time I saw a youtuber
ya ya ya ya ya ya
this I say go something like this lah
ya I say instead of that one right so this one also you can make a party right
ah
but this one if like that we can is it we can overnight or cannot can right overnight
ya
that's why
this is what I saw and I say why not right because this is quite cheap you know
if I not wrong is sixty dollars
or eighty dollars if I not wrong
but if you find the biggest one that one the whole family can share
ah so maybe we can go for that one ah
mm so everybody can go inside there so
you can see you can see me I can see you ah so we no need to go for separate rooms what
if hotel we need to go for separate room then after that we need to pay more money then if you go chalet also
we in separate room cannot talk ah
cannot gathering ah cannot make side illegal gathering
ah cannot gossip ah
so at least at least lah mm so if you think that is my good suggestion then maybe you can go for that lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
have lah
or maybe we can go cycling ya over there we maybe we can go cycling right
I'm not sure who can't cycle ah I not sure
but they can uh ride on the bicycle right
they got family bicycle because our cousin got children right
so they can rent the
the one that family
ride together so
the mother and the father
ride the daughter no need to ride ha
ya
so I think better right
because if we cannot do rock climbing or we cannot do zipline at least we can cycle we also long time no cycle right
maybe this is the best best part lah that we can do
ah
maybe we can plan saturday morning
mm no maybe afternoon
oh ya because actually we don't want
um
we don't want
take off day on saturday right
because we don't want to waste his time to so we need to wait for him to come back right
so ya
mmhmm
the next morning we go cycling
oh over there if I not wrong got burger king eh
if I not wrong
if it is really at east coast right I think is much nearer to our cousin ah
ya that's why
but I think uh over there we can use barbecue pit or not I also not sure ah
hmm maybe we can search everything
um
inside the
google
you can search what more activity that we can do over there
mmhmm mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
I don't like to roller blade lah actually right I want to go snow city you know
but everybody say don't want to see seh don't want to go snow city say boring boring boring the I say okay lah nevermind lah
you want to go the I went to go ice cream but nobody want to go with me
alah huh
nobody want to go with me then I see just forget it lah
like that lor
maybe if can why not we go right
but actually snow city correct lah it's boring lah because you need to play the slide slide only
because that time when I school time I got go right
ya very very cold
mmhmm ya you need to wear very thick clothes
ya they give you glove
of course
because that time I go with school right it's a school activity so everything have been paid
before we even go for the event
ya
yes correct it's very dirty
ya
correct
wah we die
mmhmm
ya
but zoo is so boring
that time remember go on our birthday april is like so boring
you can't even play with the animal
ya I want to play with the monkey
then I want to touch the lion
but I didn't get to touch the lion this time
last time when I small at least I got to touch you know
lion
that's why
so it's a hot day man nowadays also it's a hot day
if like I aiyo if I go there eh
right that's why
so I think we should
plan properly ah if we really want to go for activity
ya
obvious ah they going to bring their children because nobody going to take care since
a'ah
mmhmm
ya
ya lah I think um
will love it okay will love it
the one that is suggest just now
it's a nice view lah
ya
not bad right
we really don't have enough time for each other also
but got zipline or not
oh ya kallang right
rock climbing right oh ya ya ya
ya that's why but if I not wrong need to pay you know
I know
if I not wrong have
maybe we can buy some snack ah
but you know like this kind of
always have uh family gathering kan
mm
they
ya but you need to book also you know
a'ah
you never know sometime
people want to walk inside alamak inside your tent
oh ya we should have a receipt eh mm
after we already book we should have a receipt ah
hmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm

obedient eh

hello
okay can alright mm
so how are you
ya lah you what have you been doing
mm
mmhmm
so
so
really
oh I don't like to work from home especially
about one month
I rather work at from the office
so between you and me the the the experience is different lah
ya
how long how long
so my my environment my working environment is not
as comfortable as doing it in in in in the office
so so at least you you have a table and two monitors right
then my drink then how how how is that
effective ya
mm it's not at all also
oh my god and the
and he he is used to that
mm
and your room
oh okay
or
orh
mm okay so the experience is quite
okay lah for you compared to my experience is not that okay
so different experience
back to school already right
oh
oh one more month wow
ya you're left with one more month wait you started since when
wow you got
two months of holiday ah not bad ah you
mm
uh huh
like what
why
spent too much on what
oh how much you earn ah that that that job
mm
hundred per
oh
ninety nine
per night
wow
okay
makeup stuff
orh
Tampines
huh then how you travel seh
Yishun correct orh so you got straight bus there lah
technically lah a bit lah
compared to staying at ah compared to where you are now until
mm okay so now you still working there
then now now what
why experience what you pack
but is it fast paced job
so how long did you work there
uh
as in one day ya numbers of packs to pack
one thousand
two K lah
mm
wow not bad ah you
do you know you know in cause I did packing job also but the best
uh the best position is which one or not the first one
means right you are in the in the emtire human line
cause all you have to do is just
then the rest all just need to catch up what
ah kan so if you are the first person it's the easiest job ah but quality check a bit hard ah
I did for foreign workers so we pack for we packed food for the foreign workers at the dorms
and that was crazy and tiring also because
err we start at about nine kan then we need to
you stand and then you pack that's all and then you pack damn fast
so I usually need to scoop the ah the rice is either you
then total the whole day must I don't know what's the target lah but ya it's a lot
it's a lot and tiring and
and smelly because you're in the kitchen
when you take the bus home you'll be like the most smelliest person ah so ya cause you work in the kitchen ya it's damn tiring
the industrial area at Woodlands there lah
mm so they needed manpower uh so they asked manpower from my company so so ya lor
mm
yup my current company lah so this this this the the the the workplace that I work for
has good networks with my company and so they asked manpower from my company
they they pay us then we help them lah mm
mm
ya lor so that's why I when I ask you how how was your experience for the packing I understand lah what it means when you say fast paced
oh
buat apa
swabber
nope you don't need you just need an experience I mean you don't need you just say you are available then you you can lah
no ah you will learn one usually it's either you are an assistance or you are the one swabbing
so my friend applied for it
and the pay is quite good lah
three K lah three K for I don't know how many weeks of working lah so ya
oh
oh
so you what you
oh okay okay can
mmhmm
mm
okay
oh
it's the easiest part time it's the easiest packing job is it
compared to your your your makeup makeup one
you just sign up only
mm then for
how long is it by contract basis or what
oh
oh but night shift though
mm
technically ah what time start
eight thirty must be there
then finish at eight
so eight to eight err eight to eight ah
oh
okay lor can lah then you better survive in this job
packing
is it
mm I understand
how's you and Andy
ya that is tea don't you realise it
mm ee I ask you first how's you and Andy
you and Andy on InstaStory
oh okay okay okay okay
oh
that's why you guys spend time together
mm
Andy Andy Andy but then got one time no Andy at all
oh I mean
oh
but you always prioritize your work from what I see also
you I think you know how to balance so they have no say
understand each other
good lah good lah
mm
not talk
mm
well good lah good lah at least
in in this relationship the two of you
ya so when you guys have your free time then spend as much as possible
ya how long already ah
what
three years
not bad ah three years ah this is this the longest
mm
I actually forgot who is he but ya I understand
okay I cannot recall
I okay okay I think I remember I think I remember
ya never mind focus on this one now
ya
okay lah actually I don't know if you realise anything on my Instagram though
ya what assumption did you make any assumption yet
but did you like did you come across anything
you are my close friend right
ya lah because his side he don't make it he don't
uh his type is he don't show either his relationship side or he only show more about his his own life
which doesn't really involve me so ya mm
ya so sometimes when I see you and Andy I'm like hais eh cause at least sometimes Andy will show about you then you will show about Andy that kind of thing
err me and him are dealing shitty stuff now lah so ya
do you know what he's working now
mm you have no idea you never follow him on Instagram ah
oh
you know what is that you know right
insurance agent ya so he's an insurance agent
so under but uh under there's a sister company called
so err basically how to plan your how to spend how to plan your finance according to the muslim shariah law
mm so okay lah
ah so so he invest I mean he he work on it until he reached to a point that he already is a certified
cause once you
to once you join a full time job you will surely meet new people kan
ya so you will meet new people of many of different ages uh different character
okay lah I get his point where I get where he's coming from
so um
so he was telling me all these then he said okay so
I
fourth year in the relationship
okay so okay ah now I explain to you what happen
so he was being honest about his feelings so he was like telling me ah oh um
he wants to to what is it called he wants to
he don't know if this is what he wants because he wants to explore
explore means he wants a bit of freedom
like uh means like me not disturbing his work or me not disturbing when he
go out and hang out with his friends if he want to hang out go and hang out that kind of thing I thought that was it you know
get it so means ah means ah like for example I'm Hans and
you are the first the new person that I met right
then I don't want to feel guilty talking to you
ya without at the back of my mind thinking about Lina that kind of thing you know
ya so
so
okay so I told you this is not the first time it happened this is the third time it happened the first time it happened was during his
ah so that is the first time it happened
ah it
so the thing is he
that when the first time it happened he actually talked to someone
already and actually like like want to know her even more
not interested lah because that girl also have a boyfriend
no is err volunteer corp
yes means you volunteer for
ah
so
okay so when it first happened I take it like okay never mind
okay I do have my emotional uh breakdown ah I mean mental breakdown and shit for the first time it happened
then okay done done done done life go on as per normal then second time it happened still during his
Hans until talk to her on the Whatsapp lah like
so first time it happened okay
okay people might say it's cheating lah but but but but
I don't I don't take it because he is telling me what he's doing
that's the thing
okay so when it first time it happened okay I let it like okay let it pass
then it happened for the second time
correct a'ah
so during is also volunteer corp also
but this time around he haven't made any move he wants to make a move but he tell me
kan uh
ya
this is what I'm trying to say lah don't know why until I hold on until today
so the third time it happened which is now this period it has been three weeks already
the third time it happened nothing has happened yet
like limited talking to new people
especially in his workplace and stuff and plus it's his first so called first time meeting a group of ladies get it
know more about people get it and he thought he he basically said this to me he said that what if
he found he he will meet somebody that is um
err way better than me that kind of thing
ya of course then he said to me you are already the he said this to me the benchmark is you
so the benchmark let's say ah this is me ah this is the benchmark so he wants to see if in this world
I said that to him then he say ya correct but what if the thing is
his so called
reason or intention is he don't want to regret later he want to regret now he wants to make the mistake now
let's say if I leave like for example
if I leave him
will he feel regret and he will he be able to meet somebody that is better than me that kind of shit lah
so ya hais
no I don't know because
together remember we had this night calls
I tell you that Hans really want this relationship to to end up uh like like a real thing
then now this get it
ya so this is the gist of the entire story
that's why I'm like so tired of this emotional breakdown almost every single day
but then then if you ask me ah if you ask me now why are you still with him
then I I then I will reply you I also don't know
so ya lah
like that's why when you things like uh on Twitter will say this and that right you you wait sometimes you need to leave you you need to let go of the people that you love
eventually but it's so hard for me to let go
ah I've invested so much
on him time
thinking thoughts and shit don't know lah
this thing has been almost like it has been
like a month like almost a month
that's why I was I was quite impressed with how you Andy are together even though you are very busy you still can still go back to each other
for me and him we are too dependent on each other that that now he want to do his own thing
the thing is he can but I cannot do on my own thing because I'm already
I've already so called shaped my life around him get it
not exactly lah
I don't see
I don't see other things I don't see other parts of my life without him get it
is I don't have my own like self goal
okay
I got my own goals but like again it revolves around him that kind of thing
so it's
yes sure up to you you can go ahead and share
mm
mm
but you you do try to recover after that right
mmhmm
mm ah that's the word make up
mm
ya lah
cause that's how you begin the relationship also so
kan
mm
mm
mm mm
with him
mm at least at least a goal with him kan
ya
now is we used to now is
no goal
we like I say to you we we
we agreed on one goal which is next year maybe
late next year or early early next two years to get married now is like err am I getting you for nothing that kind of thing
ya
ya it gets to that extent so
so at least you have a goal okay maybe for you and Andy it's not marriage maybe it's to travel together first
to know each other better maybe I don't know but
ya so now I'm just like
uh like that ya so
I'm taking day by day but really I feel that at the end of the day maybe
I
met his parents
his parents still thinks like you don't have to rush into things and stuff
ya so
at the same time Hans' father also said don't make her just like a
haiya ya lah the thing is
the thing is if you if you ask me
if you ask me whether I'm hurt and stuff
but the thing is it hasn't it hasn't go to a stage where okay the thing is
my my type my type right
my type right is if I break up with somebody I want to cut ties with the person
obviously will you
mm eh
like
kan kan so no matter what you'll surely cut ties with him with him right
mm
okay the thing is it's it's also hard to cut ties you know why
because me and him we have the same group of friends
so far so far during this period right
where uh like
mm
so ya I'm just telling you so there's no okay whatever story that I've shared there's no bad guy
in this story lah okay people might say it's him but at the same time
it's also me for staying because I I'm getting hurt
for no reason I could actually just leave
ya I could just leave the relationship then he can do what he wants I can I can take care of myself
recover myself but the thing is I choose to stay then now the situation is not any better
see I am aware sia
err like I don't know a week ago maybe
he's
I know I understand
hais
hais
no
I want to tell but I don't know how to tell I want to tell also but I don't want to tell that kind of thing you know
but
I I hint only lah I hint to my mother only lah
I don't like to tell cause I just don't want to uh
I think I tell only like
three people
three people from my friends and then you one then my colleague at least one so at least he knows why I'm feeling like this during work time so ya loh
on my Instagram I think people can like oh okay Hans and Lina is no more that kind of thing
ya
ya
mm
too
I have fallen for him too hard that uh now I cannot see myself doing other things besides being with him that kind of thing
get it
I still stick I can say that I'm quite a loyal person lah but
that's my that's that's what I'm experiencing now so if if you happen to like see my Instastory and more to green colour right
ah it's just me expressing my emotions
mm and and now I'm trying to work on my mental health because it's really affecting it affecting me so badly
huh
ya it affect
when it first happened I've been going home late from work
so I left work I left office at about twelve
I'll just knockout ah so knockout about maybe sometimes if I decided to express my feelings to anybody or to him I'll sleep like I'll sleep as late as maybe three o'clock
but I sleep as late as three but the next day I have to wake up as early as eight so that kind of thing lah
so and that
that first two weeks it was the worst because it has it repeats so everyday is that
then
and I really can see the difference legit you need sleep
so um
so ya but I'm catching up on my sleep already lah so that is good enough
hmm ya at least sleep at one or at least don't cry to sleep that kind of shit ya
ya
ya understand lah
it's okay
to nineteeth
ya I think I don't mind just hanging out at your house also make myself occupied and shit
busy
ya ya ya ya
ya your kitchen got the vine right I saw your Instastory what
busy seh
ya I can see that
but at least you got a working space seh that is good that's what I need eh
we just need a different type of um router ya
ya
kan that's why I rarely do my work like you won't even see me do my work in my room
mm
ya means we need an additional router right
ya because the one that we're using now is in the living room next to the
how many wifi you have at home
oh you have two
one is at
mm so you are connected to your
parents' one
mm
ya
it will be eventually right this is the this is the norm now also you know I
I now conduct workshops via Zoom
mm
so for example you work let's say you work from nine to six
that is your normal work your normal work
then we got Zoom meeting Zoom meeting is to make sure everyone is in then we we we are all
ya because the thing is now my team okay what's happening to the team now is okay I tell you now ah
err
I and one more colleague is in the office just the two of us then the rest one err some of them are deployed in community club
some of them are deployed in at to do social work
so so they are deployed at different places but the same time
why they are deployed at different places is because these places will give the money to the company then the company will can pay us
our normal rate
mm
ah
uh
mmhmm
no just now one is because I had to do a a mini training for this ah tomorrow's training
ya
ya so ya lor
then anyways so I am starting another job again cause I was just
I was like quite happy that I I'm out of the community club
then on Tuesday I am back I'm going to
ah ya is to I'm going to do some homeless job you know as in err
pay to maintain the the the cash flow the money going in the company
ya so it's tiring because you are doing that job but at the same time you're doing your own job so you got two jobs
ya
it's just it's just COVID things ah it's it's it's it sucks bro hopefully hopefully by the time you get your first time first full time job right everything is back to normal
ya
uh
mm
five hundred right
ya that's the rate for poly
huh
your is
five hundred
unless you work at retail retail will be eight hundred
ya so that's why I never like you get to experience internship right then
at least you experience the paydrop when you say it's five hundred for the poly we will say it's normal ya it's it's just the rate
as an intern
it's okay lah you already pass through the err internship phase unless you want to go degree then maybe another internship
being what broke oh you want to work for your own
up to you your decision you still got like half a year to go
September
ya you're graduating April right
ya
or you can take a year break and work then go and study or you can study part time and work up to you
it's your choice
mm
but what degree you want to take same similar or
similar as your the things you are doing now or
or you want to try something new
business ah
mm explore your options ya
ya eh not bad seh you went through like different certificates seh
kan kan then then when you have a kid right you when you have a kid right then you can say which one you want to know
I went through all ya
you went through N O uh and higher NITEC then diploma if you take
degree you go degree ah if you go further ah all also you have
oh it runs in the family
uh uh
ya like that ah depends ah what you want
me

mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh
oh
queue again lah from the back
mm then
oi
mm
the area lah
mmhmm
ya ya you did you did
mm
yes
mm
hmm
mm I was contemplating on what
manifest
temek
oi
twenty eighteen
mmhmm you still cannot say his name
yes his prints are like a cow
on the world map but black and white
you were you
yes
ya
mm
mm
sec
five
seventeen
mm
ya
ya
but
ya
ya
yes
what
yes
very small
hmm this is small already
mmhmm
mm
mm
ya
mm
is this
there's less demand hence there's
no
well less demand equates to higher price lah because there's
no more saturation of market
for there to be a
mm
ya
I think I think lah they will start to downgrade the price but it's not
decrease they will decrease the price but it won't be soon
mm
ya
mm no choice lah
mm
yes
mmhmm
mm
well ya I didn't miss the outside though
no no no the house
I like your room but I didn't like the outside
oh that okay
ya
um
yes
mmhmm
yes
mm they are very very nice yes I agree
the room is nonsense ya
ya your female friend that one
something like curry or stew or something
mm
mm
mm
you will considered it
for yourself
then there will be two rooms and so you rent out the whole thing
mm
mmhmm
mm yes

oh so this one is um actually like or you tend to move to your home first right after your wedding kan
tru
um but again I thin
ya that one agree but I think give you like certain allowance right like a number of you have to complete the basic renovation is that correc
oh ya lah that one I think normal lah since my time many years ago also same also lah the thing ya so I think uh ya your dad perspective or opinion I thin
quite correct it's just that I think at least if active for lor at least the basic must be there like for example flooring and then like painting but I think for every house the most important thing is the flooring and the kitchen cabinet at least lah
oh because I think you have to that is because that's the one I think make most no
ya I think we w
do the edit the the first bottom and then the top right you need to do first that will be cheape
that's one suggestio
ya I think that will be cheape
yes it i
for the wedding righ
mm I think I think in this case ah I think your situation is very similar like mine so I think you have to prioritise things like ah
okay so basically like for wedding like ya is once in a life time bu
more fundamental lah but in terms of guest if let's say the other party agreed maybe cut down to two hundred fifty eve
let's say a super ya gemod lah gemod is like very stingy like that so basically like that we just lik
invite two fifty then maybe like you know uh his side ah
hundred fifty ya seh hundred so that super budget kind of thing ya it can be don
like like for example I thin
ya like I say like both have to compromise lah it's lik
like okay in that case we do separate lah that is another alternative ah other alternative then your side then ah then he has to like make a figurative speech or what figurative speech oh wah like super english like tha
K so basically like you he has to tell frankly to his side like yo
the pros are I know now the trend is all combined but provided if let's say all agreed and transparent on board the costings and expenditur
uh bottom line you both must tel
err got two choice if want to combine the
then err you and hairin you he tell his family how much he can afford you tell how much you can affor
extra guest whereas for his uh no need then you leh you just you just invite lah whoever that is important between your lis
err then is like you al
you know last time you are fortunate you actually know that you gonna have six months down the road after the wedding that you have a flat you know how my time I got my flat is so like you know like how to say ah
think that time really I think I could engage in january finall
july I got a fla
then after that I think um at that tim
we buy some things on our sid
then suddenly when the time come the exchange is not there so it's lik
so I buy solely whatever I can afford that's all lah ya correc
I think if I were you I will actually create an excel spreadsheet the reason is because I I will actually um pros and cons if let's say I have I have this budget okay what I know if combine I I pick let's say shortlist two place on i
then okay shortlist already know what they have you don't have the push ah you no need to type ah you just put what are the key things that are there okay how many dishes ah food ah food dishe
you will you will see like ah how much it is can I find the similarities you have anothe
uh tab that we're actually for separate cost then you see the cheapest of all including the decoration the ball hall everything like per head like how much then how many dishes there from there on okay let's say vehicle K you must think of eh um
uh what we collect like okay let's say if car put there possible free you know okay is to make it compatibility the same as like you are in a in the same central place lah then after that uh if plus decoration you see how much is some I think per head come with decoration simple simple decoratio
uh then after that from there you see we which is much better so at least when it comes when they're both families sit dow
okay because you will have to target by maybe end of this yea
ah so then from there oh then you all like oh okay lah then can start working I know you your what you're getting married twenty twenty tw
ah so if let's say cannot fit maybe we aim january twenty twenty three that's the worst worst timeline lah so that even though you got five months uh to your new place but actually you will actuall
like you have the time to what we call you know already you have some surplus cash ready that for you to prepare the basi
okay let's say khatib uh when you move in or maybe you need to check first because we already have the basics right so you just make sure that you have like simple lightings for some places only or you can actually have th
like uh the cabinet or whatever because I believe uh you got to check that one lah renovation too so you get the minima
you can even ask err K what's the minimum renovation I should do within that timeline because what happens if I don't have the amount to have a full renovation you can ask them all these so that at leas
like I'm pretty sure you are not the only owner like this lah there's a lot of new couple that are buying flat also wha
so basically is like that ah so that is one area that you actually ca
can save on it lah that is one part of it ya so ya lah so I think you you you ca
take I mean seriously you wedding's already a big headache if you ask me seriously big headache ya then having a new home is another big headache so it's just that now it comes one one can take care kan
my only thing is that okay if he's uh you all have to like let's say workout lah the thing lah workout the thing then from there on then you will se
how is it uh on i
oh I think uh
need to actually like you know find the time for it for to have this share with his parents especiall
that's good actually is one advantage so she just going to spend a lot of on her coming honeymoon maybe next year there's one of her plan lah
but then you have to stay in one place for two years lah or in fact one year next year I think I don't think they will open for thousand people stil
ya I think still about one hundred or hundred fifty the most y
frankly speaking err is a good time to be use if you already have some budget even for like hundred fifty guests or hundred then if both ar
okay kan then at least like you know you all can have the wedding first and then after that ah
uh take it positively and then now do live streaming also possible what you just need to pay additional for the live streaming lah so there's one one idea you can hav
you can have the big wedding but err we have to burden one of the side lah
must stay don't know until when because after that don't know how your selection because I heard once you withdraw you want to apply again can take some time if no
if not ya ya that's what I hear
then if not alternative you do the resale flat lah kan
okay so err if you want to have this guest is up to your own description of expense
you lost your down payment of two thousand dollars from the but maybe you don't put your your your plus point you need to think about renovations you are just focus on one poin
and then uh so you spend lavishly ah your your whatever you needed to okay that but you need to spend five years three to five year
ya ya actually but before you all have a discussion uh of course you separately have to talk to your own parent
oh ya then your your when both of you display what is on the table and then let them decide lah
ah what they want lah ah because I thin
err mix up what is it like like you think that oh what I want to have oh I want to have nice photos then you just think that okay nice photos focus what photograph I want then how much budget are from it lah
in other in one I read about in err on here like for example you know certain things when you exchange actually for example sensitive thing lah
I don't okay y
both side actually exchange gift ah how many you want to have it depend
ya I saw all my friends they give the cheque but I think now cheque they were really better PayLah PayNow lah no need lah I pay now loh
ya correct correct so I think it can be just a symbolic amoun
okay what righ
ah but I think in today's context can be just lik
if not screen shot and then you se
if let's say you know the oh your partner ah really can't afford this right so but he he he he's willing to take care of you he's willing to you know he can take care of yo
you know that means that if you have a flat together what know you all still are able to maintain its just you all need time need the time to start up or maintain so it's either two way either um
like I said lah is the thumb comes with terms of agreement like either you all actuall
uh get the support of family either by you can stay to the other place one of the houses you know for like three to five two to five years and then we get married earlie
or you actually like err like both family are agreeable to have a smaller budget then all had to start out on the ne
home ya because if you ask me this term it takes a village to raise children but I always believe it takes a village to even start a hom
ya lah she wants the opinio
ah there are couples are like that like they because they don't stay in a one home under one roof right so of course there are things that you can hid
and then maybe like err the person uh then where the family said firmly talk oh it is a very well to do but initially it is not you know that uh kind of situations o
err kills the that particular portion lah but in this younger generation in your generation err things have changed progressivel
they cannot even get flat eh they must buy a condo or private propert
ah high ceiling income but then err there's one period of time he changed jo
you know that particular period and try to appeal you know ah and then they finally got it ah then but there's a word then the reaso
err a a very meticulous person who are very fact this or more usually this happens in a matured couple lah ya where the
ready above thirties then they think long term already so like when I ask you both like above ten should be able what stay in condominuim or what then they say no lah to think tha
I have to pay more than half a million for the house I could headache already ah
like very stress then me leh then ho
uh you know the more th
okay for you maybe because your parents comes not in my generation slightly older generation so apparently like you know they have certain exception um but agai
I thought generation we're beyond discussion they always have a room for discussion but the thing you as
you know and ah both ways lah both parties lah so uh people might say money not no money is a need when you want to start a family but did did as a parent you look at these two aspects lah
also you have enough that's a situation like that okay but you are working you know so that is the one funny part sometimes that can happen that's why I say ah
financial planning to me is it is very important though I'm not a very good financial manage myself but the thing is at least from the mistakes I learned I share with my kids I say you al
ah then you anything you want or you want a lavish wedding can and you want a good honeymoon good then you want to have a very beautiful flats also ca
ya involves money ya but the thin
really we really have to have to do it because if not later you have problems and then um you can't convince your parents lik

have you watched the the the the what the marriage
ah the world of the marriage it's on Netflix now
so you watched the first episode
okay um for my this is my opinion lah kan

ya they he like secretly meet up behind the
the the the lead actress the wife the first wife behind her back

the show kan
like merepek apa

I learn makeup from TikToks and it helps a lot
only use on your sweaty area which I think your cheeks don't need any
mm
I think that now my makeup stays stays longer now
cause I only use powder I only use foundation over here
over here and over here

every time I ask you for things
where's Odella now Odella was like everywhere
people still buy
did you all lose weight if through using the that Odella
a lot ah how many
how many kilo you lost
wah in one month
but
what you wanted wasn't weight loss then what you wanted
really now did you get your already
is that
oh
then you thought you dropped out

okay
mm
what type of superpower I want ah
because err even though they have all the riches but they actually work hard to be what they are ya their superpower meaning
they use their brains than they train their body
and they learn
how to
um
how to fight
they learn the martial arts
okay and on top of that they modify their weapons become better and better
you get what I mean
um ya it's not a
err
err to fight crime
like
err and they don't just fight
err those on earth
people from
the aliens
both of them ya
how about you
uh
uh
mm
mm
bat batman or iron man
uh
mm
specific
ability is to fly
mm
mm
powers
doctor strange mm
uh
oh
mm
orh
mm
mm
ah
ya hogwart that one ah
ah
but a superpower a magic power is not a superpower
telepathy
mm
mm
okay
mm
mm
mm
like a burdensome superpower
I change mine to
so that can get
from one place to another
quick
but not
but not
teleportation ah
teleportation boring ah
teleportation is boring you don't get to see the view of
when you travel there
but I want to see the view of where I'm going like let's say you want to go to the mountains you want to enjoy going to the mountains also not just be at the mountain
if I'm
you are it like night like like night train kan you don't take the train to just be at the top of the mountain you want to enjoy the view
mm
mm
okay
mm
that's also superpower to distribute your money away to people
ya but you can help other people
no I mean you don't you already you your superpower is being rich then you can help other people
just giving away your your
your rich
mm
um
mmhmm
mm but people need what
okay when you are rich you might not feel that oh money is not everything but people who are poor need the money
so my thinking is when you are rich you give away all your wealth to these people of course
not to one person you distribute to everyone meaning
when you have a superpower of wealth right means your wealth is unlimited so you can give to you can give
your wealth to unlimited people
to help them of course you don't have to give that one person one million lah not not like that lah
ya but you can help them in some ways
you know
like
like
free public housing or something for everyone who are
no you should
mm
okay then
as a superhero
you can set
what you want to give
meaning instead of giving unlimited money for them to live for the rest of their life you give
the basic needs only
which is
basic needs that they
very difficult to afford food
for
food they can work for it meaning they can work to earn a living to to get food
but things like clean water deposit more difficult for them to get you know especially in certain country clean water difficult
so
you set up
a housing free where there's clean water
but bills is
let them
err
let them err
it might be a it don't have to be a very
extravagant houses
you know
you enable your superpower as a person who rich you can set up jobs for them to work and
you know
they can be the one working at the factory that provide the clean water for themselves
mm
it's a
power
ah
ah where you can give to people
uh huh
okay because most of the villains in and cartoons all have money that they use for evil
so my take is
the superhero has a lot of money
then he's using it for good
destroying poverty
poverty poverty is the evil
mm
but how
I think that one is only for yourself you know if you learn everything because
the key is if you learn something you must
pass on
what if
mm
mm
mm
mm
and then make it free for everyone
should you make it free for everyone or should you not make it free for everyone
then people will say that people will say that err no need to work lah
just need bare minimal
then how do you decide which one is free which one is
subsidised which is more expensive
ya so you you are the one who as who's deciding then people will think that eh why our our
our
health care
people might not see that that way people
ya
mm
mm
ya superhero I you say is
iron man ya
or maybe err
err
err superman is boring lah or maybe the flash
or
mm
or maybe ant man
the most stress free
superhero
wonder woman
uh
cause you are as beautiful as her
okay let's talk about what is the burdensome about every single
uh superhero with power what is the most burdensome
what the most burdensome of her power
mm mm
what's the most burdensome
not about
advantage
mmhmm
ah
okay next
no no that one they they they are not reviving him there is a different personal clone
he's a clone
ya
it's not it's not the
someone made a clone
of the boy friend
it's just a clone so I think
the person the villain who made
that clone until will be the one lah who will fight
wonder woman
err something like that lah the storyline is the villain made
clones of people or something like that
of like
err letting out no
cause you will not allow a lot of people can watch at once mah
the box office
revenue will not be a lot
ya
stream
apple uh
ya right
ya
apple apple lah the I
for that movie
for and you watch for a
certain period of time
uh
they'll new movies will go into
that one produce by Netflix that's why they do that
free
ah
so
it left on movies first
before it came out in Netflix
to Netflix
that's how Netflix fund them
they go by the stream
because they know that the more streams that people watch
people are
subscribing
ah that's how they get their for themselves monthly subscription
uh this is how they fund their movies
if they put a certain drink people will like will want to
that's how they make money lah it's not just
from the box it's not a traditional box office
sales you know
not just
subscribe and err upgrade their
account
from one person only
mm
let's say
of course they will show as much as possible but
or maybe they say that if you want me to be in you must I had must have a minimum of ten minutes
for every
they can they are they are free to pay any amount mah to produce that movie
producers need money and sponsors to come in also to to produce the movie
you fast forward eh you
mm
mm
but you will miss out on the details like
you will read about it
mm
mm
uh
orh
orh
okay
mm
superpower
mm
very burdensome power
what is the most burdensome about every power
about every superhero sorry
what what's the burden
with
great power comes great responsibility
ah ya lah what's the burdensome about every single superheroes' superpower
mm
mm
ah
what about
what about the batman that doesn't kill people
mm
so what the batman need to do from
actually
burdensome

let's say
thor has a lot of flaws
thor has a lot of flaws
he can't be the king of his own
people
ah ya lah
that that is flaw lah
and then he's
he is not a god he is more human
he's not a god of thunder he's a more he's he's more human
that the story is just telling people that he's not a god he's a human
no he's not a god because he has flaws
he can he he can die also
that what the story is trying to say is even a god like him will so god has flaws

the same at every house
some people have surround sound but some people just have normal

campus radio

based on experience ah just saying
okay
free
huh
okay one thing that I wish was free
err
it'll be hard ah
transport
just free transport for everybody
it would cost a lot of but then the thing about that is that
a lot of people will take more transport then it will be over congested
unless other places but I've heard like some other countries also like actually provide free transport
I've heard
yes yes eh actually that's very good points ah a'ah sia healthcare
mmhmm

they switch
from what I hear is
that
oh they switched it because ah during war times and whatnot so they are like trying to trick the enemy
something like that lah that's why they switched the names
but I'm not entirely sure ah
unfortunately ah unfortunately
eh but thank god though
like hundred fifty per month
to like support
two days ago
then I'm like oh
okay lah go
ya of course ah
oh that's it
oh damn
oh damn
yo that's some levels of discipline
that some levels of discipline respect respect
um
technically we already reach one hour ah on my clock already
now it's sixty minutes and thirty three second thirty four thirty five
a'ah
others

hi hamzah
uh no contract ah
um ya but then
the new plan iphone eleven so you pay about
four hundred dollars
but I think minus fifty because got voucher
um
every month
pay fifty five so it's almost double ah
okay bottom western epitope so calculate um mahjong
what okay two years eh so it's two years times fifty five dollars
times twenty four months kan about extra seven hundred dollars ah kan
but iphone eleven uh how much ah iphone eleven now
ya the lowest one lah I think thirty two
okay
um
ya I check a bit the difference is about the incoming I think free eh same ah same um
twenty I think
I think
maybe less than ten ah maybe seven also
a southern or northern her window kaliyah asean
um ya lah almost four years ah
ah that's why
ah sorry again
oh but but that time kan that time I pergi tu apa um challenger kan iphone seven
is two hundred and seven two hundred and eighty dollars I think seven ah but seven also like
also present lobang ah no haunted
ah no contract
but
no but
oh oh K then
oh
but now they are still selling or not iphone eight
mm
but
ya but now starhub plan ah the iphone eleven is cheaper than iphone X
no what are they doing
ya
oh
oh then uh how how's your job search
then um
you K so like estimation by when you think you can finish the
ya
but I heard
actually now eh all the interview ah
the developer they eh you need to
proper other start looking in you will forget up things so the the technology keep changing right ya when it go
this kind of coding test kan
oh
the the you must type the code inside
I think they asking the maybe they ask the approach right like how
mm
okay
so actually I I think you know right this monster dot com
ah I think they really keep calling you know
it's like
very pushy ah so like
then like the salary like they ask very low then it's like my expectation lowest is like five hundred more than five hundred dollars more than
ah what is the maximum lah the so called maximum but I think
I think better try to be firm ah kan because there's no point you find a job that is lower pay than
I mean if the pay is worse than your present job then
it's it's a bit ah pointless kan
so like
ah I forgot the word lowball ah something like lowball ah
no no value ah kan
but like the destination
aviva you know aviva insurance
ya but but most
it's not permanent ah but actually because if those who no bonus then they should offer higher pay right
be eager to you know um ya
join the company like this
ah mostly
so tuition
but ya that's why
so that time middle of october kan so called most of the exam already finish
so now is middle of august right about two more months ah kan so actually
I think one or two weeks before ah two weeks before
but there's N level there's N level you know there's normal tech and also normal academic right ah so
I think the normal acad or normal I think
but I think normal tech is the earliest ah maybe can't remember
actually both both both about the same ah one week difference I think
the normal tech
huh
ya
because like the hall
it's like a big group ah then people will walk past the same place right
so I think they or or maybe the hall have but then half the what occupancy is half
ya
so actually that's why now
if work part time better lah until october
data entry lah you know those
just typing on excel kan basic ah
ah office ah and typing or sending email those basic admin work ah
but part time
they say part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends must work
some some I think you see the job description kan is not so clear like
but how come they feel part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends you must work or some some I think you see the job description and is not so clear lack
they said that they said um they said okay monday to friday the timing is um I think
about five to ten ah or four to ten like five hours ah or four hours
then weekends full day but they say
um for two to four days a week
then when I say okay I only can do weekday then the person reply um sorry we need person to commit on on weekend
ya so it's unclear ah
ya as long like okay I think there's two right so I'm not developer ah so
like but mostly mostly also must support ah because my the thing I don't like is the support evac
sometimes middle of the night they will call I mean they call you up phone phone support kan
so phone support is a bit too much ah you know
ah that's why then but even if you work from home you still need to like
they call you at late night and do the work or something
python right
like the code is like very simple and it's what readable kan it's a it's it's python programming considered high level kan
uh they use like they use words like can be understood then it's high level right
so like low level is what
mm
it's called ah fortran
A N ya
is it C hash or something hash
ah C sharp
huh golac
G G O L A C eh
oh golang
mm
okay then
because
building kan
or web development
I know how to like maybe like all these ah data and then maybe
a bit of support ah the support kind of role ah
because like for me last time I work in a bank kan
twenty nineteen ah twenty eighteen to twenty nineteen I think ya
kan
that time I work in a bank kan so
so um laymans kan the back end ah so
you know logs kan you know logs
L O G S ah log log
okay so you just like if let's say there's a what you call that
go to back end and then take everything out lah
then investigate maybe or something
um the front part is a investigation ah
but the it's like ticket ah like they say what
support and ticket and then
uh raise the ticket then
issue then if if you complete then they close ah
then last what you call that analyse ah whether the same issue might repeat again you know
to me it's it's quite um interesting or it's it's quite a
how do they expect you call me at four right and then I can think straight and execute whatever you ask me to do right you know
for me because I'm the support so it's like
in the bank it's called uh run the bank ah not change the bank so run the bank run the bank means um
it means that the the app is ongoing ah you understand like it's not a project ah that means the project already finish that means it's live ah live product being used by users ah
some more actually the issue is because it's global so
you support until surpass eleven eleven countries right including america australia china uh all this so the timezone all weird weird one
so all the weird timezone means like if something happen like you know the job fail right
so time is twelve hours before us what
ya then their working hours until our six what so actually our system right is twenty four hours live you know up because off on tues what I think there's only one period that
low low what low traffic eh
ah nobody use or low traffic is like singapore seven ah because that time that time australia all finish all the thailand all finish right japan all ahead what only lah then just wake up what that time
because there's two countries new york eh no two states
new york and where ah san francisco right ah
no don't I don't they have their own server that means the user right use the system then our server ah
I don't think so ah or maybe no china have china have but china and hong-kong have I think but
like because it's only a singapore company I mean because the bank is local bank ah our local bank so ya the business not so much ah
so it's only user use like the user
like the apply loan all this ah this basic functions ah kan
oh they call it the green eh green lane eh
but but
we cannot go right
ya but somebody must handle that what
they can come
ah they they can say ah ya they can use the fact that their house right at clementi need to do something ah right collect the mail the mailbox ah because
um
but the the tenant kan you know the eh now they change tenant right that time
so the new tenant have to keep the mail ah
who
okay
cousins uh
they I think busy also ah
but
it's hard you know why because
I think I think the best time to cook is midnight ah
you lock the door close the door
but
you will not their dog ya the dog they thought
you buy from where
huh
mm
so there's money
it's not in the fridge eh
oh
if like this to I mean the sweet and sour fish I think
fry the eh fry the fish first right
I think the it ah the the the preparation is a
nevermind you you work harder you get a new place or house hire a maid
or or hire a wife ah hire a wife to be your to be also a part time maid ah
but it's it's good if you have a maid ah but
the best is we have a maid let's say let's say in the future
or maybe I thirty five year apply for house kan so one maid right um share our woodlands house
they maybe my future house or your future house ah so then like the maid right
they stay no they stay there but then means then few days can stay
they can stay somewhere else ah like
ya I think someone call but I ignore first ah
hmm
ya
no but I think
internally kan if
I think the the maid will will have no problem to have link somewhere and then get time off ah right
I think it it it's not about legal or illegal ah because um as long the maid
huh
normally the maid off sunday kan one day off kan
ya
but I think they're a bit
eh
but
that all means but the that means the so called the map kan is fixed ah
but what you see in the is live or not or just like a map a virtual map
virtual ah
ya then if the stock finish
oh wah cool ah
so call move ah
I think no but
I think I think ah Singapore difficult because you know why or not
so or they can they can go to park and then walk like someone someone mental ah
the but I think the hardest part I think is the interface ah the mapping kan the timing and the lagging this one is a big issue ah kan
but they they can they will monitor your work ah
oh ya ah standard meeting ah kan
oh last time that time zoom you all also use zoom ah
so actually zoom actually zoom suddenly get hire more people kan during the COVID
really ah
huh they going to open here ah
ya but singapore smart ah I think they know how to what you call that tap into the market and then what tackle all the issues ah
oh good ah ah are you buying anything else from ikea
ikea the the food open or not ah now
ya
oh open already ah I don't know ah
half ah
I think half of that
eh I think because I think
susah nak apa kita
ah predict the people kan because if some person couple then two or four so
so like the table they they don't know how like half is
couple or half is group and then one person
oh actually don't but I think this one in singapore mostly don't have you know those um
the long table single person eat you know right
they they call it what ah counter counter you know counter table right I think overseas a lot ah like last time I went I went exchange also same ah I I
because most people will eat solo ah because last time the lunch time is between the period right
so
the counter table is like just one person ah then you face the you face nobody ah like you know face like a the wall or something ah so it's like against the wall kan
ah actually they should make like that
no it's not it's like you know those it's like
serangoon garden so it's like outdoor no it's outdoor but it's indoor lah you're it's not inside the mall but it's like those outdoor setting ah like like al-ameen at our place the the woodgrove kan
ya open concept ah like is is like sheltered lah
there's a indoor and outdoor then I think that time COVID
then
they like the the table outside is mostly like two person ah then the inside right all the table right is like
they close off one side tau that means like if you eat four persons right you all you all will eat you all will seat down side by side
so that means like the four of you ah or three of you kan will face the same direction you know
like the they don't know I don't know what they are doing ah but actually they can just
you know like tape properly then ah section off like one table instead of six right become four lah you know
I mean they can do that lah but I think
maybe today they change lah because maybe someone or recommend or something if they actually doing that
or if they more than five
so I think recently there's a news ah then they like to inter change like I think they
but I think
but must pity the the business owner ah for because actually right like very strict ah I mean eh it's it's not the kan
uh eh it's so they are very strict ah
so
I think some of the
kan complain ah like oh call police ah I don't know what they call ah they call some
ya
to to to complain say that these people because
actually oh at first maybe they ask them to go out lah say don't come here because
you cannot mix right
another search ah you know
but but how they control right they said they got crowd control right that means people cannot go in if too many right
they they call it the maximum occupancy kan
ya I think maybe like they have a counter lah like the system can control right no but now the issue is the the tap out people don't
don't don't ah what you call that scan out ah checkout from the place
huh
ah trace together kan
oh that one
oh because of bluetooth ah
but
no but the app is running while you close the app like
like will the bluetooth be used when you are using the app at
ya
oh
so like between ah android and they also know what to do right
ya
um
maybe okay or maybe I change to Google ah kan
I don't know ah because like maybe I want to try Google ah but
because I have the you know last time I buy the macbook air kan
they gave me the free speaker what google home mini eh
you can play um I mean you can play the eh what's it called ah the radio station like singapore radio station
ah live streaming ah as long you got wifi lah
so actually from the wifi eh but actually dangerous oh I realise kan they recognise our voice oh
the google home speaker ah I mean the I mean google home ah
because right that time kan my friend kan
so
I ask google ah using my voice ah like when is my birthday or what is my age ah something
then they know ah cause I think like google gmail ah all this something
so like they know uh something like my birthday or my name ah
then because my friend got google phone right
oh there's one time he use he talk on my google speaker ah the google home speaker kan then he ask um like what is my name or something ah
then the google know that it's him then say his name
ah or birthday ah ah I think birthday also no birthday is like very hard to guess what
you you can guess the birthday means you know actually the person what
ah so a bit scary lah I think but I I heard like I saw online that you know like community kan instagram or something kan
but if the wifi off kan but K let's say we on the speaker but wifi off do you
I mean the so called electricity is still passing in the in the device kan
so will it still listen
um connect you
to the
but default ah but if you ask like questions like um
ah offline what do you call it offline data ah
what basic basic functions ah kan
ya
it's good ah
that time I went that time I went exchange
because I think america amazon they use amazon what a lot so
I think because they also got money ah so their apartment like one room one bedroom ah so like those studio ah
got how many version ah I also don't know ah
smart home device ah
but is it a brand or what
no but the smart oven kan like is there a brand for smart oven now
oh
oh
got smart shower or not I don't know
oh but the smart shower cannot anyhow on when you are there lah because later you go toilet
do business also cannot I think maybe they have a touch screen ah I don't know
or voice ah
eh but that means right COVID better what if let's say because of COVID right the hygiene kan then I think maybe future ah singapore the lift also maybe smart kan
or lift system
I think can make right
oh the base I mean there's a pedal kan
so your card right is only access to level one and the level that you are working ah so you tap right
then then after that
the screen will show like which lift is going
like you thought because there's like like there's two screens kan too many screen one is left one is right kan
because you card is only one level ah

okay
I think you can start the conversation
hello
so let's begin our conversation
what about you
oh ya
today
so basically just now I went for meeting for the final meeting for my for my commission project
satisfying
no lah I mean
for my first time commission project for my first ever commission project not firstly lah first time lah
consider
well I mean they are willing to pay me two hundred
almost three hundred because I

the part is okay but with the waistband the arm hold
trying to find the fit
just ya the jumping part I'm bad at that
but okay lah
no that's like ruffle
yes
I don't know maybe is my drafting is wrong
like the curve of the arm hold shouldn't be too curvy
but I think my one is sharp
it was supposed to be like right ya I think mine is
very high
you know when I is like I sew
I didn't actually follow the entire thing
I just dug in

how did it go
the zoom is about
and it has been two week eh no
at work not at home
and you haven't start
hmm one month
or is it prorated
so the cut off date is eh there's no cut off date is not is a full time pay right
but that you only get paid mid of the next month
ya
this is like my workplace the full timers get paid mid month no twenty twentieth every twentieth of the month they get paid
my one for temporary is only end of the month they actually not ended end of the month
is not even end of the month is seventh of the next month
what
what is actually right there is no cut off date some more so it it's look like you're working
forty days
but you get paid can already
but most of my bills will be end of the month my phone bill
oh gym
still ah anytime fitness
F forty five
oh Fitness First
best
ya
what
I also don't understand clementi is
uh huh
huh what is all these polis
oo okay
is it like walking distance
oh
office
ya is because like now you don't have
you know err a proper working schedule
so you can go any during the non peak hour period
okay that is cheap
for one month
no lah like how did
oh is cute
huh
not one three six anymore
so everytime they will change the
cost of the
actually
like the promo will not end lah
mmhmm
oh
but you are paying the insurance no
so that is equal
like one fifty lah roughly
ya because is cheapest deal
hmm
but how do you know like whether you are doing the right form
oo
oh ya
but have you ever thought of joining F forty five
you were from F forty five what usually when you go to work no meh
you were still working there
during the F forty five trial
you were still working with us right
yes I remember
yes
it was
mm
but after that you never continue your F forty five
and lesson oh ya
I want to try sia
yes
except for you
ah
mm
ya
you mean by reps ha
oh my god
I know one of the one of my senior from poly
but
what I know now she is working at
F forty five as a trainer which is shocking
mmhmm
she's fit but
again she begin without any experience from fitness
then
no don't have she she was just a freelancer for graphic design
then now she's a trainer
if you see right
all her videos her
story
she will be training at the gym itself
at the studio at F forty five studio
and she improve a lot sia
east
serious are you are you serious right or are you joking
but gym trainer I I mean the receptionist
sure
yes
maybe after closing ah
after closing you just close the gym and then you can have the gym to yourself and no training that's all
yes is not the receptionist job hey got a cleaner for a reason
barry barry what's that
B A
woo
oh okay wow
they all so fit
khai friend what happened
as a receptionist
okay what is he doing now
khai
why
mmhmm
oh okay okay okay
what
mm
he bailed
okay
ya
hmm
they just throw him in the office
and give him work to do right away
no training
oh my god
then he quit
like said goodbye to them or just
very what will be like so tragic like if you went then they might where the new guy
did the the manager or supervisor call him
ya
well ya
but then the part of the contract term is
oh is the just for this job is just for two month so there's no contract lah
then it's okay ah
then got
how much is he paid for this two month
huh
ya and he has it's office hours monday to friday
one point five
really meh okay lah my first
but not admin
no pay lah like he he he didn't even clock in the entire day is only one hour then he zao
wasted sia
ya what happened to the brooks brother
no the thing about her
ah I
last september
then I already photocopy I need to fill up the form
for uh for claim any any kind of dates I need to fill up
I already submitted by end of err end of september
the end of september
seven or eight october
then uh when I receive my pay in november recently I checked then I ask her lah luna I haven't received the claim that I was supposed to then she said oh is it let me get back to you and that is on six november
yesterday was twenty first right
twenty first november I texted her again I asked her hi luna is there any update about the claim
and she never reply
she never reply I can show you
I mean twenty five twenty five twenty five dollar and twenty five cent may be may mean nothing to you but
you see
when it come to this one she just disappear
ya
I mean come on lah I'm underpaid in the first place I know we're not supposed to share about uh our pay
but among our my colleagues all of us actually
talk about pay
yes
for me I'm just temporary there so I said I just said oh my paid is one point eight only
and then my another colleagues she also another temp staff she said my pay is one point nine
ya
then I said is it
then she just said maybe is your agent don't want to fight with I said I did offer a higher pay but she refused and she said oh the rejected don't want to pay any higher
is a shocking lah
because
to compare me and her
no her experiences is only from C K
ya
so it's not fair I I have
job experiences
from what retail from high end boutique
from H&M
bridal
so
I don't know how they actually
I don't know how they actually gauge the pay ah
maybe but job the thing about it is the job ad put two point two to two point four
and I actually put my expected salary as two point two because that's what the job said what job ad said my previous full time job I get two K what so
shouldn't you at least
ya follow up with the same rather than you know paying me lower
and then got one colleague she one year contract so her pay is one point nine same as a temporary staff one point nine leh
one year contract
so one year one year contract shouldn't she earn more because she
yes because
their workload is much more they have to do emails and then they have to do sales as well at the same time
maybe
and then there's new guy coming in right the one that replace
the bing for the ya that's the new guy
and then he go and say how much she got paid to my other colleagues that got paid one point nine
more than two point two less than two point five
you I mean
contract one year so same same contract as her so the workload is the same
experience wise ya
she has a diploma cert
he only stop until
from
changi
yes ah
yes
so is he he also worked there for two years sales only
no experience in terms of emailing or what this other colleague she even though
but her past past jobs her intern job are all related
so of course lah I understand why she is angry lor then
ya she got paid one point nine he got paid like two point four so that's like five hundred more eh four hundred more
yes
so one one point nine she brought home one point four eh one point six ah one point ya ya
ask maybe
your ya maybe your trial period pay
even if it's not trial period right actually is by project
yes yes exactly I I mean I also don't know lah like try your luck lah then she said
no lah but then if I said it like that right surely my the manager will said you never read the contract properly
her fault
kan
cannot lah sia I don't think the manager will even talk talk to us about that like she won't be comfortable discussing this matter cause is not his
liberty I means he's not the one that
gauge how much she should pay
he's not the one that agree
and do the interview
is the right
but that means she has go through
no
sad sia
she is
because she's got paid the same as how much I've I've earning and my job is so easy eh
is just doing sale
no pressure no nothing
even though we don't get commission lah but still we are still doing our job
actually their their pay is is good leh for full timer
two point six
email lah I mean one thing about about that is
you have to do email while you're on the sales floor
is not conducive
then after that you have to stop doing your email you have to serve the customer
then after that when you go back to your email you forgot what what you want to say already
cannot like that what ya exactly like you need you need a space for you to really sit down and read your email
and during her off day also you still have to do work you know backlog
you have to update the you have to update the shit
saying which one which case or which customer case you handle and then you let's said the customer follow up or the retailer follow up you have to you have to continue you have to update
yes
yes that why is not that I don't want you to have the job but is just it doesn't justify the pay ah
yes and is not only that sia
the big boss will be
yes
cannot you cannot said that
I I want to ya because I have four days leave mah I want to clear my leave
but if let's say

kaplan as
oh

hello my name is hady
hello faidil um how have you been
so ya I haven't been out too much lately but I hope it will change in the next few days
okay so I have um the first question for you my first question is um just the other day I was walking outside um an apple store at white sands shopping mall
and I was looking inside and I saw they were selling this new phone ah that apple just released I think probably about a month or two ago retailing about maybe eight hundred nine hundred dollars plus
and I went into the store and I took a look at the phones and I was just comparing it with the old models and I didn't actually notice much of a significant difference in the looks and I read up on the performance not that much of a difference and I was just asking myself um I was wondering why would people fork out such huge amount of money for phone that is so insignificant in its performance or visuals compared to its um
previous models I just wanted to know your thoughts on that
um for me I would one hundred percent say with certainty that I do not think that phones in general should be retailing at four digits like one thousand dollars personally
I like to think that anything above five hundred dollars really is more of a luxury rather than the necessity
and I personally think that there are way more quality phones that you can get the super underrated for less than five hundred dollars and I think it's quite sad to see a company like apple maybe take advantage of maybe hardcore users by simply releasing phones that
are way out of the average person's price range and
I feel like it's obviously a bit sad to see from where it came from from the past years and you know these phones that come in at four digits are not really much to brag about in terms of any innovation that it possesses compared to maybe an iphone that came out two to three years ago and I'll be personally disappointed if I was a fan of apple and see with what they come up with
and I just think that since phones are such a necessity in our daily lives I feel like a one should strive
to aim for a balanced price range versus a top quality performance of a iphone
so ya I mean
so ya that's my opinion
um my second question for you is the past few days the weather in singapore has been really hot
and with err the importance of us wearing mask outside with COVID going on how have you been coping with the blazing weather so far
ah ya for sure I agree
it's crazy to see what the weather is like nowadays you think that living in singapore for twenty years you get adjusted to the humid weather but it seems that everyday it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and obviously we can attribute it to
whatever you know the climate or climate change or you know but I do agree that I think the only way that we can you know try to battle this weather is to stay hydrated keep drinking lots of water and try to get to cool places as often as you can don't stay out in the heat for your own sake
um ya and please don't forget to wear your mask cause for the wellbeing of the people around us
and my next question for you is what is one thing that you wish was free
um ya um that I totally agree with you
I can empathise with with having friends who um don't have great vision and seeing them fork out a few hundred dollars on something that they need
which is the spectacles and obviously is not going to be easy for everyone to afford you know cause
obviously spectacles are very expensive although it is a necessity and if I had one thing that I wish was free I would say something along similar lines I'd say I wish that healthcare was free
cause it's as a person who has been to hospital trips a few times and I've seen the amount of money that not just me but maybe the people around me have to fork out
just to pay their hospital bills and obviously in singapore is I'm very thankful that the government helps us a lot in subsidies but obviously healthcare is also important in singapore first first class
hospitals here and first class treatment and I guess can't take for granted the subsidies that the government gives but
my parents have to fork out some cash and my parent's siblings have to fork out some cash um just to be able to afford and you know help chip in
so in an ideal world if I could ask for one thing to be free I would say free healthcare for everybody regardless of who they are what their salaries status is
mm yes
um that's a good question something that I've thought about since I was a young kid as well I'm sure everybody has thought of it and been asked at some point if I could have one superpower it I guess I have to go with um the superpower of invisibility
and I think it would be pretty obvious why um I think it be pretty cool to be running around and nobody sees where or who you are
I can just board the plane and get past custom without anybody seeing me you know can travel anywhere I want
so ya I I think I'll be a pretty good criminal if I had the invisibility superpower you know it's just I think it'll be pretty fun to say the least
nobody can see us and obviously I hope for it to be
um temporary rather than permanent cause I still want to see my parents
I don't want to be invisible without them seeing me that'll be that'll be pretty bad I'd say what about you
I mean ya that's that sounds great to be honest um mind reading um I'm sure everybody has wanted to do it
um
we can have any planted tube inside our brain you know where we can access one another but I guess for my own personal reasons I wouldn't want people reading my mind you know
I'm sure you agree
um ya of course my next question to you is if you can instantly master three skills
what would be the three skills and why
ah ya before I say the three skills I master I um I agree with your last point about being able to
um be friends with everybody cause as an introvert
I often see myself having maybe a bit of trouble maybe a bit of shyness trying to
interact with the people around me although at the same time it makes me treasure
whatever friends I have now more than anything I have in the world
and right now the three skills that I'd master
the third skill that I would like to master is probably
hmm
I think I would say
being able to master just learning anything as quickly as possible and obviously it sounds more vague I mean I'd say anything cause obviously in life you will come across a lot of challenges and a lot of new experiences and
I think it would be great if I could just learn anything at hand just instantaneously cause
obviously I don't want to fall behind and you know let's say I enter the workforce and and um you know there's something new to be learned or something new to be
to be found out then I guess I would like to be able to learn it as quickly as possible
just for the for my own benefit
and moving on my next question to you is
do you watch and if so what genre of do you watch
from ya I mean ya actions sounds great um I I also want to ask you what what kind of movies or shows do you watch regarding that topic
maybe
dwayne the rock johnson maybe
um ya that I mean I mean I'm not personally I'm not a big fan of action myself I think I would rather access my emotions cause my favourite
genre of
or movies I'd say is definitely romance cause I'm a bit of a softie myself so I like to cry
some of my favourite shows or movies of romance I'd say for shows I would go with master of none starring aziz ansari
it's really great it really got me in my feelings
for movies there's a lot but I name my top three I'd say number three I would say maybe um five hundreds days of summer
starring um zoey deschanel number two maybe I'd say her starring joaquin phoenix and number one I'd say lala land starring emma stone and ryan gosling
obviously any movie starring the rock and kevin hart
those are absolute blockbuster movies and they always live up to their names
um ya and
regarding the questions about I'd say in this generation maybe is not quite the medium where we watch movies nowadays I think most of us would want to watch it on our phones
or maybe on a tablet where it's easier to access I mean obviously it's a shame to see dying out but
ya this is the new medium and most of us have already adjusted to it
I I agree I personally myself for romance movies I
my favourite movie itself indeed it's not the ending is not the cliche of
other like other romantic movies in fact the ending it's not cliche itself was the reason why I was crying so much cause it was so unexpected
so ya I mean it's hard to pick out something that is so good and and maybe a genre that is so saturated with just plain jane movies that we seen over and over again
and so now my next question to you is along the lines of and movies if you could become an actor or an actress who would it be
um ya johnny depp is indeed a fantastic actor who doesn't love pirates of the carribean right well personally I would say if I could become an actor I would
want to become ryan gosling
obviously cause he is in my favourite movie lala land acting with my favourite actress emma stone
so you know if I could take his place that will be pretty sweet and I mean the guy has acted in quite a lot of great movies like nice guys and and I guess his sense of humor and how he says it in a dead in a deadpan way
I kind of see his resemblance or my resemblance in him so ya I I like him
I mean I mean to be honest if one day I woke up as johnny depp um I won't be complaining to be honest but ya I guess johnny depp and ryan gosling personally really not
the same type of actor maybe
or maybe play the same type of movies
I mean you have your own opinions and I have my own taste ah so ya and to be honest I don't really care about who johnny depp dates to be honest
I I more of a fan of the movies that ryan plays so ya
I mean it'd be pretty sweet to wake up one day as a as a famous actor in hollywood
um my next question to you is
would you rather fight one
horse sized otter or one hundred otter sized horses personally I think I would rather fight just one horse sized otter cause
I think I don't think I can handle one hundred of something
and very small but you know it comes in pax so
I think I might get overwhelmed pretty quickly but
it's just a hypothetical and I just want to know what you think
thank you for agreeing with me and my next question to you is on the more sentimental a nostalgic note if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago what would have been inside that time capsule
if what else would I put inside I probably put in a few of my
xbox three sixty um console disc inside cause I have very fond memories of me playing games on my console when I got back from home
from primary school games like tiger woods tour maybe or maybe like
um
FIFA O nine or FIFA ten
where I would just everyday go home and play it carefreely
so
um ya lah um
just
I can't I can't really think of what else lah to put inside but
if I knew I'd agree with faidil as well
I would put in a note to myself I think it's like it's like what you said lah um I just
I just write to myself and
and just talk to myself about how life how great life was ten years ago
I I really wish I could go back in time ah
so ya that's what I would find inside my time capsule
do you have a question for me
okay sure I I will ask you the question um my next question is
if you had three wishes maybe for yourself for your family or you know you just for the whole world what will you wish for
that sounds like a pretty decent innovation
I I would definitely hope that
wishes
you live a cruel world and it's hard live without money so I just give an infinite amount of cash to
basically every single billion person in the world
you know just drop them a stack of cash so that they can
live a better life
my second wish would be um being the crazy football fan that I am I really wish I could own
chelsea football football club and cause I I really love football and I really love the club so it would be pretty cool to own the club lah cause I think that I can run the club better than its current owner and I think I have some pretty good ideas and on who to buy and
you know I can just give myself unlimited free tickets to watch the games so it's I think it's a pretty good package you know if I could ask for it and my third wish would be
um if I had a third wish I would just um in a cliche kind of answer I would wish for everybody to just have eternal happiness cause
it's hard to see your own friends or your own family be down sometimes
and even yourself so it's like it's
I mean obviously everybody goes through rough times but
it would be nice to see everybody live very happily um for until whenever
you know so ya that would be my three wishes I've heard yours
selfish
and my next question to you is
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life
what would it be
um if I could have one dish for the rest of my life
I mean I I take it as my meal for the rest of my life but
ya
I think
it's more of a sentimental dish rather than a dish of
you know something more extravagent like you know maybe a steak
maybe wagyu beef maybe
but no I would think my own mum's dish
is it a job that like any job I can choose
I would choose
I would take two jobs one job I would want to become an actor
in hollywood cause that's something that I always wanted to do
cause there's a lot of people I admire in the industry
um
I really like the work that they do and you know how they always um
the first people when the news breaks so
the first people to report on something new happens
I feel like the thrill of the job
is something that I can never get bored of
um um
there's always something satisfactory that I can look forward everyday
what about you
um wow um those three jobs sound great
and you know I will move on to the next question now
the next question is
good looks or a fake body
what would you prefer
I think would say that
a girl's personality is number one right
that's that's just what I think lah obviously everybody has their own preferences but if
I think if given a choice I would give a girl I would get a girl with a banging personality
over someone with a face like a a ten lah what about you
um ya of course personality is always number one
and obviously we cannot judge a person by what they look like judge a book by its cover you know
so ya
um wow um first of all
I
that is a surprising statistic personally
and and I just think that maybe it's maybe it's a taboo for them to talk about it and maybe they are not as open to it as us and obviously suicide is just
is is a is a horrible way to end someone's their their own life and I I hope that anybody who goes through maybe a a depressive phase you know you know troubled times I really hope that they
would seek um a therapist or someone who is an expert to to help them cause it's it's always sad when you know someone who's taken their lives or just
it's just a waste of a life ah and what's your thoughts
um ya for sure um I feel like
um the awareness itself about mental health is very important um obviously in the past few years I think it's been way better now nowadays and as someone who knows somebody else who's who has anxiety who who has gone through depressive phase and knows about it I know about them I I myself am guilty of disregarding their feelings and just telling them to you know
get on with it you know and I as having been there and done that obviously I am very guilty and I feel bad about them cause cause and thankfully obviously they did not they did not end their own lives cause you know they manage to seek help but I guess I guess everybody
why you know has has been there when it comes to disregarding someone's else feelings and I think it's something that as a community I think we all can improve on
how about you faidil
oh should should I go first ya um first of all I'd say there's a lot that I am thankful for to be born in singapore um first of all
I'm very thankful that my parents have been able to live a stable life being here um I myself have been able to been raised up in a good community in a good place living in a block
and um and seeing what my parents have to work for just to be able to afford to send them to school to send them for their hospital meetings all and seeing the cost of it itself I'm very thankful that the government helps to cover and
I know my dad has never said it but I'm quite sure he is very thankful as well
and I I just hope that
me and the people around me will be able to work hard and just live a stable life in singapore
how about you faidil
um I also like to give a shoutout to all the nurses who work during the COVID um period we are also very thankful that they putting the hours everyday cause it's been a it's been crazy times for singapore for the whole world and it just I like to give my appreciation I'm sure my friend faidil feels the same way and with that I faidil thank you for talking to me today I'm sure we talk about a lot of stuff a lot of different stuff today did you have a good time

sorry ah why why what happened
okay which man U game was that mm
oh I see the opening game against crystal palace where they were thoroughly whacked by the opposition
I think their
well bro the sad fact is that the if you were gonna blame david moyes you should blame him like for what he did seven years ago when thiago was supposed to come to man U in twenty thirteen
and he kind of like botched that transfer
ah
so so basically west ham has lost their opening two games ah
am I right okay never mind err who cares about the relegation battle especially when you're a liverpool fan like myself
you know I just the the thing that's the best part of the game for me against chelsea for me wasn't the actual game on the pitch tau it was the
the few minutes before the second half started where you literally saw thiago go around to like the coach and then go to glow and then like he was doing high fives to all of them he was like hugging them like ya I'm going again
mm
okay
uh huh
that philosophy ah
okay
the same louis van gaal were sacked by man U
okay
and their goal is the master of that school
is the top student of that school
mmhmm
okay
ya
okay
mmhmm
okay
I see

wow
so he's like the empty football guy
uh huh
okay
mmhmm
okay that's that's the same school ah
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
mm mm
okay
mm
mm
mm mm
just whack ah basically ah
a'ah
when you first lose the ball that's when you're most vulnerable
okay
mm
mmhmm
mm
ya
klopp denies you space mourinho mourinho gives you all the space you want but for you to make mistakes with ah but ah okay lah I mean I watch the highlights of the southampton game I mean wow wonderful game from a
I mean I mean I mean the work he's one guy who I should have put in the team from the start ah eh how's your by the way
sial ah for
okay so let me get this straight you play a managerial game on your four
okay
ya ya ya best I mean pro evolutions soccer ah
I've been using iphone for like the last five six years ah actually I can play on my iPad also kan
err I just watch this movie yesterday devil all the time did you watch it so so so basically basically err ah I don't know for what reason maybe I was just bored yesterday
err so in the afternoon I was watching this show it's actually the number one rated err Netflix show
okay but anyway err
the infant tyler characters but anyway okay so so so basically what Netflix does I I mean I've I've recently subscribed back to Netflix lah cause
what happened was uh when september now eh so last month err
early august after I came back from that camp that I told you about
ya the the camp the camp that shall never be we shall never be mentioned ever again so basically when I came back
err I was like okay lah feeling mildly depressed you know thinking about my life then I switch on the computer I was like
hey there's this anelka documentary on Netflix
ah have you watched it
okay so so so basically the reason I got back into Netflix was cause I wanted to watch this anelka documentary ah so so it's uh it's a
decisions he might have made in his career or the controversial things he might have made the controversial decision like he might have made during his career
I think france had a terrible world cup twenty ten if I'm not wrong
ya ya ya so
ya so so yes so so basically the entire french squad they did not want to play properly cause err
raymond dominic actually like uh had a an argument with anelka
I got into Netflix cause of that anelka documentary and and I've been watching a lot of crappy shows on Netflix I mean some are good shows lah but some like err okay have you heard of cobra kai bro
so so you have watch cobra kai ah
like they they they've model you you see so they they they profile you they so they study your model and they know okay this person likes these and and this is how we're going to get him to be like attempted like
ya ya I mean I mean obviously they use all the data that comes in from you and it's not like people say like after that like oh they sell the data
and you find that you know you okay the the the one of the biggest problems that we have with social media today is this increasing polarisation ah
cause you end up looking at people on the other side of the fence and looking at them and thinking
like like ya no cause cause your the facebook algorithm has actually
fed you the information that you want
so if you believe that for instance the is bad for the country
uh am I allowed to say
well I can be will I be will will special branch start knocking on my door soon so basically
you believe that the is bad for the country they will continue to feed you stuff from like online citizen independent you know
all this other stuff and then they will ask you they will they will get you to like group which which which are more anti government
yes yes equal chamber that's the word correct so and then and then you you read all these information and then you're like
ya so it's a very insidious thingy and and what happens is you have greater polarisation like what do you see now in america where the democrats are moving further left
and the republicans are moving further right and there's basically anarchy and civil war and you know people rioting on the streets and all that and and and people are like oh you know what's happening to america but ya that's that's how it is so
it's interesting lah like okay so anyway I was watching social dilemma but last night I watched this other movie which is devil all the time I think I think you might like it lah so it's it's set in a america in like the mid fifties
and err it's about how this guy err I mean it's not a ghost story or anything like that it's just like it's about you know
murder err ya like all these all these vices you know happening in this particular town
and how this guy this kid is trying I mean I'm trying not to spoil the movie for you lah but but
basically basically it's about it follows this guy from the moment he was a boy until he grows old how he tries to break free from
the the the the so called vices of this town lah that he's in
ah it's in ohio I don't know if ohio is
somewhere near there but ya I mean ah okay lah so basically the story is set in two places it's it's based off a book in it's based of a story book so it's set in two places ah one is err knockemstiff
knockemstiff is an actual place actually in america uh
err K N O C K E M knockemstiff knockers steve and then the other one is a cold creak so cold creak is like a fictitious places so ah basically the story is about the starts it starts out with the story of this guy who comes back from world war two so he come back from world war two
is err you know religious you know being religious and religion and having faith and all that lah
so so he comes back from the war and then like his mum is like you know that church going christians sort of thing but he is like losing faith a bit so he's losing faith a bit cause of the atrocities of the war that he has seen
so uh and then finally he gets married
to this lady
and then err and then and then and then
but ya you know you know you get what I mean but then this as he starting
to feel that closeness to god a tragedy strikes a family ya
feels a bit distance from god doesn't doesn't feel and and the thing that makes the story err
complex is that people who are seemingly supposed to be good like your
your reverence and your pastor and all that they are also twisted ah I mean in the movie they they they
ah not not just inner demons ah I mean they are just they are evil people ah you know like okay one of the reverence in the story is ah robert pattison
I think he's going to be like the new batman or something kan
ya ya ya you've you've not watch robert pattison is going to be the next batman
so so so so but eh but he is he was good in this movie so he plays like
like a last full kind of pastor in the show ah
so and and and that has major consequences on the the characters in the in the movie ah
ah well he doesn't he doesn't molest children ah
a'ah
okay
are you sure you want to say this on err are you
are you sure this is the sort of the thing that you want to say on on on on the record you want to go on record with it
okay okay
not not you're not referring to the Android box ah
oh is it
so basically it's an lah
okay okay
ah
oh is it
but I think it could be cause of the cuties
okay
okay
ya I mean I I I I watched the trailer and then after that I was like what the heck is this
ya
okay
ya ya ya
ya lah they are like they are like eleven years old eleven twelve years old ya so maybe not even not maybe not even eleven like the singapore context that will be like a kid in primary four primary five ah it's like not not even ah
ya ya
mm mm
mm
ya
mm mm
ah ya ya ya
I think she's french algerian or french morrocan or something like that
I mean the the entire show also it's about this muslim girl kan
ya okay okay senegal is here ya ya
mm
and I think I if I'm if I'm not wrong I read somewhere that uh they held auditions
and like a hundred plus girls came for the auditions
no lah
I mean okay we we we know it's an open it's uh not so
it's not that that much of a secret that that hollywood a lot of the producers are taking advantage of girls and sometimes these girls are really young like you know I mean not just girls I mean I I also read like I think kevin spacey he he wants like
err groomed this fourteen year old boy or thirteen year old boy ya kevin spacey
so you you that's that's the that's the thing you never you never hear about kevin spacey anymore but I mean he still has his fans lah
because of this ah so
so I mean like in singapore dee kosh obviously if you if you look at his Instagram account on his Twitter account like there's no there's been no posts from him for the last one and a half months
high speed internet that we have and you know all the like sexualisation that you see in the media and like you know porn going into people's homes and all that and people like not having that kind of like
a'ah
okay
ah
okay
alright
oh my god
and he was a lieutenant in the army
he went through ah
okay
ah
okay
he's he's a good kid ah
okay
a'ah ah ah
ah ah
okay
oh okay cause
okay so so so how how much older are you compared to him oh you're just a year okay okay okay so so ya lah cause you went to was it sorry we're not we're not we're not supposed to mention our schools
okay so
so when you went into army he was already a lieutenant and he was recently in the news for voyeurism not voyeurism what do you call that upskirtism
so he actually did it
look eh look bro bro if we're if we're if we're comparing weird ex schoolmates ah bro
so there was a guy in my batch and I mean like
he seemed like a normal chap in school and all that he was recently jailed for like twenty plus years cause he actually brought singaporeans from singapore
to I think cambodia or laos to have sex with children
seriously yes he he actually set it up and like he got money ya ya exactly sex tourism so he got money from from like singaporeans to bring to
so he was like I forgot his name ah but but but I don't know but
so basically he was in one of those classes ah
so but I I know him and I I mean not know him know him lah like I I remember of
his existence back this in ah
yes
ya
this pakistani migrant this chap comes from pakistan is nineteen twenty years old he doesn't know a word of english or word of malay but he comes to singapore and then like
naturally lah cause he's from that country
maybe I don't know ah maybe we're we're looking at it differently lah maybe maybe it was different but I I think that was the situation ah from what I understand lah
ya
and and this was of course before the disco era this was of course before the you know the sexual revolution of the nineteen sixties and seventies but of course during our parents time I mean
I've I've heard of stories of my dad going like on a date with another
women apart from my mum ah
sorry syed ahmad we didn't mean to mention your name
oh okay
oh okay K K K K I know I know I know I I I know that ballad okay so
ah we're we're we're not quoting anybody by the way just
okay so anyway
what is he gonna what is the world he's gonna face in in twenty years' time ah
a'ah
ah
okay
uh huh
uh huh
okay
ya
okay
mm mm
ya
look and ya look and behave a certain way ah perhaps ah
a'ah
ah
mm
ya
mm
ya
well I mean what can you say ah these days you know there's not a lot of thinking going on ah
and I guess people are just
following trends ah just doing what the next guy is doing
you know I mean everybody man woman is
ya she she she has that fear and
that hesitation of wanting to do something away from the norm like cause
you know I mean when I got married I got married in a mosque and and back then it was like
but now is like quite common ah you know nowadays you have mosque
ya lah but you still had your your function in a activity hall ah my my my point is
in twenty eleven when I got married it was
err I mean there there are some huh
err subject to any of these trends I feel lah
you can lah you can but but but it's not encouraged cause it's a small mosque but what
ya
ah
clear on what it is you want to do
what your intentions are what you are trying to achieve and ya just hold it that ah you know I mean also I'm like actually I'm looking to sell my house lah I don't know whether I told you
bro sengkang bro raeesah khan
oh sorry was that too loud jamus lim
err unfortunately unfortunately where we are right now this is not sengkang but it's okay
no no this is ang mo kio so
ah sorry ah every conversation between zulika and myself must involve some degree of politics lah then you know there's some spice ah
so uh we've covered politics we've covered sports we've covered religion we've covered the latest show on Netflix but that's what we talk about you come uh we have a how many more minutes do we have left on this thing
okay we've got fifteen minutes left that's good ah ah
I I don't want to play games ah I mean I think I would draw the line at games ah
ya
my wife my wife and I oh but ya if singaporean then it might me and my wife ah okay
a'ah
okay
wah
that's a very productive err your time bro
oh okay okay I watch breaking bad ya ya ya ya ya
so I think like there's five seasons or something and then you watch better call saul
you know something I I didn't have the stamina to last through better call saul is better than breaking bad eh you you should talk
oh my god okay
ya lah he hasn't changed his name yet lah
okay
yes yes yes yes
uh
okay
ah
okay okay
and and that happens right about season four season three season
four okay I see oh ya ya ya ya ya
err so I think his brother died or something eh
ya I mean I I I kind of got to the part where it was a very testy relationship between the two of them ah okay I got to the part where the brother went back to work
I I I roughly remember that cause to be honest with you I think the last time I watched it was
what like two three years ago sia
okay
huh
I I've never watch game of thrones ah by the way
of course ah bro ya
there was a prison break movie
yes he died right
wentworth miller
oh okay he declared himself gay so so like he died he died
to me ah no no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding
okay ya that's true ah
I didn't watch the movie or maybe I did I I can't remember it oh ya I watch the movie
there's a season five
oh my god I I thought this was over sia bro
I think I watched that I I I feel like I've watched the movie
ah
a'ah
a'ah
a'ah
okay
a'ah
sial lah bro you could have read all the books seh in all that time sia bro
oh I heard of that but I didn't watch it
okay no no no let me tell you let me tell you something else that happened to me
apart from the fact that err I got the subscription to Netflix okay on top of that what happened was
I bought I bought a new iPhone recently lah so this is iphone
okay so the previous one is a six S plus which is bigger so is a you know it's it's one of the new boys lah so apparently you know now if you install fourteen you can double tap and then you can safe entry have you heard of this
okay so so basically basically where how do you do your scan safe entry
okay ah
a'ah
a'ah
okay
okay basically
okay basically basically for me I can just
hey siri scan safe entry
and then after that like and then after that like
you know the singpass app the recently was in the news cause all your results
ah all your all your results will be in your profile in the singpass app so basically
so basically I just scan and then all the details that they need will be in and the other good thing about using your singpass app is bit is that basically if they had a detected case in any of your location they will inform you
they will automatically inform you so actually actually the singpass app is very very useful lah I don't know why I didn't use it before ya so so so now instead of using siri and saying you know scan safe entry I can actually just double
tap my phone and it will scan safe entry
so that's the new thing with fourteen but
it's only available on iPhones which come after the iphone eight
I think for me I don't know about your phone but for me if I bring up the camera it doesn't automatically scan the code I've I've never actually tried switching on camera and seeing if it detects a code
a'ah
uh huh
it automatically scans the code oh okay
it goes in a anti clockwise eh clockwise can you see the
okay so this is the this is
there
like that
eh so so so err we're coming to the end
okay
oh I think I know what your day is referring to
but I tell you no no no bro bro bro I tell you it's
ah both ah
with all these different stalls it it feels like a hawker centre cause
but I mean it's a bit late for for prata simpang bedok ah
you don't know mahamoodiya

I was looking through our the booking right
ya okay
because the one that I found was
the same place because
okay err
ya but what's your budget
hundred plus ah below two hundred should be okay right
ya I think only four lah right
unless dylan joining I'm not sure
ya so err
but I'm checking my friend like cause my friend got the uh call um membership
so he got discount lah
ya
that one is sofitel is at tanjong pagar
very near what the hotel I mean I mean you can go I mean it's around there's a lot of cafes there also what
ya
ya I think it's all nearby there lah
ya technically I don't know also what to do
ya but we need to decide soon lor
yup
it's gonna keep on surging until like new year I guess
ya lor
ya oh ya my company just say like they might not close for the week so I might have to take leave ya
but then I think I'll take the whole week lah I see how lor technically I got no leave
zero
again okay last year ya oh ya last year we had the what
ya no but whenever tanjong pagar theme
don't know
I don't know lah maybe theme
oh ya are we doing gift exchange also
we haven't plan this yet
ya
oh really ah
from which err supermarket
ya
sheng siong sheng siong also hard sia
I mean you see my area around down here there's no sheng siong the nearest is bukit panjang mall
giant lah since we just with brandon
eh last year we did giant
aiya
eh ya ya
so what
ya I remember the cause I think got more things to buy
mm
who's the free one ah
can you plan
please
you have to be codes
this is not chinese new year
dinner
but now buffet very irritating ah
ya
but buffet town though
you know there's the the one that just got halal buffet town ya cause they got very nice salmon head like grilled salmon head
ya it is
mm
is it I there's only one buffet town I think it's at raffles city
I know
oh ya buffet town got not vegetarian option though maybe have I don't know
cannot be go buffet you want to eat salad right
ya
oh ya but they haven't confirm their attendance also
okay
oh ya true also
I mean if we're not going to into phase three anytime soon I think
did you see the news yesterday
they say like because of the
trace together like the
ya so it looks like not going to phase three anytime soon
yes
and then we cannot book separate table also cause technically we are not allowed to
no they don't allow but because of that lah they're afraid intermingling so actually by right you cannot book
ya
different timing
ya
can
so what they did was because they I think got there's fifteen of us
so they separate into three different sessions
so got the lunch session teatime session and dinner session
precisely lah I mean you cannot meet lah but
ya
ya so I don't know whether we are still going on with the dinner or not
oh ya just five of us lah
without partners lor
mm
that time you did right like the four five of us
last meet up it's just five of us what
korean ya that ah
farin birthday
oh
oh yes
ya I mean just let them let them tell their partners lor that
ya
ya so I think the dinner one is settled
so they don't have to spend it with their partners anyway
twenty nine right you say or twenty eight I mean it's the night of the
staycay right
ya
ya
mmhmm
ya okay
ya
um
at west he can come
but he only come at night after work lah
ya
mm
ya lor
monday right
is it really
ya
oh
okay I thought it's monday and tuesday
you
hais
okay lor we shall see how then we need to dig up more
ya
then he say it's like seven hundred oh my god like the one the I bought was only four hundred sia
ya because it's technically already the end of the year already a lot of people doing staycation so
you know right technically there's nowhere to travel also everything is expensive here
you are in a cold room
whoa but luckily I went taiwan sia just before lockdown
ya
err not as good as that one we we went that time
on some days it was quite hot actually but some days it was quite nice then ya
but that was a stressful trip
hais
hais ya
ya
eh but I heard the vaccine are coming in right so I think
there should be the light already like at the end of the tunnel
um ya
but you know the that time the who say ah which minister
like it's only like selective like they're not going to do a mass vaccination
ya
ya
so I think we have to queue to get vaccinated kind
probably lah elderly maybe the front liners
ya
it's probably like those flu vaccine vaccinations lah wait those are compulsory right
ya maybe they make it compulsory but not so soon
I don't know
but until then I don't think we can travel lah
want to give up
ya because I think singapore is the safest now one of the safest ya
ya
ya
mmhmm
was there lah oh my god
mm
err they have another issue to tackle there oh my god
mm
are you talking about succulent
oh
the normal one cactus
succulents are technically not from a desert I think
that's okay welcome to the plant world
mm
oh I don't think that you can probably survive in our climate though
as in real life okay I see
what sia cardboard
oh what
I mean even though you don't eat durian but
ya
hais anyway I have an assignment on an essay lah so I need just err your your point of view lah I guess
mm it's about um
locked down like
like they say like they are more problems than benefits when it come to lockdown like
it affects a lot of thing
like so I don't know what do you think
kind
I mean
why
mm
ya
true leh ya ya
ya but
no no it's usually quite sudden kind a week before at least I guess
mm
ya
mm
good what lockdown good what I was enjoying the period
mm
ya
ya
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya
so you feel that there's more societal problems lah rather than businesses businesses still okay right
thirty to
oh
ya
mm
okay but I think there's a benefit to that you know because like these forces are but like enterprises this small enterprise right
they go digital like because like the government has been like I feel lah like always been pushing
all these to go digitalisation but nobody's doing anything like but I think this lockdown really pushes everyone to just straightaway go and
like to and what embrace digitalisation lah so I think it's quite good in a way like
ya
ya she can straightaway err
ya lah alhamdulillah I need the money so what's the problem
to avoid this err to convert their platform store into online platform lah so
mm
true I mean you will lose your human touches also lah right I guess ya but also the thing like this lockdown like
a lot of people just start their own business like a lot of now like because of a lockdown so I think
okay ya I think so then like societal I think also got benefits like
err
I think it brings families together
kind
that's all lah like
so
ya
I know
not every family can get along lah hundred percent get along so
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
mm
all the one she studied at the corridor that one right
ya probably
ya I can imagine like those like
staying in a rental apartment with like nine or ten family members in one wah then
ya
right ya
mm
ya obviously
ya
mm
true
mm
but I think right another benefit right is definitely their environment like have you seen like you go out during it's like a jungle out there
I mean it's such a good time you know for everyone to heal for the world to heal like
ya
you think your floor will the grass will be three second on the floor already
ya you know what I mean
ya definitely bro
they are better lah because you know carbon footprints were reduced lah I mean
not a lot of cars were out there
that the biggest benefit lah of the lockdown it reduces like reduces the
cases like at the very enormous straight lah like just
ya
ya
ya
okay lah at least they are well taken care of I hope coming from what we see on the news I think they are quite well taken of just that I think
the problem lies because they are being locked for too long so it cause a lot of emotional and emotional distress lah I would say
ya so
ya
ya you can't visit leh
ya I mean what can you do also right
ya
mm
ya
maybe they did lah like factor in this issue
but they just don't know how to tell singaporeans how to manage their emotions I mean
but it increases like distressed like emotional distress and see like people are going crazy you know
probably probably that one is like not a priority I guess I don't know
not counsellors lah what what is it calling
counsellors is it not counsellors
ya it's not even consider essential at that point like they can't even work ya they have to work from home and go
ya so
so it's not even essential at that point so ya
ya
mm
I know right I want a bit longer
ya I mean this is probably the once in our lifetime we have this I mean hopefully yes lah but then not expecting more
ya ya ya
I mean in this lifetime you can say that we have a point alive and everything just reset like the whole world reset ya
during our time
ya probably the start of a new civilization
ya eh can you think for me anymore problems or not for lockdown I need to write my essay
societal business and emotion is under society lah I guess
wildlife or nature sorry yes
you just any problem right
I think there's nothing to argue about it I think when you the problem can be like you walk in a grass then touch touch your leg
mosquito because of overgrown right all these then they bleed mosquito remember the this case lah on the rise during
ya but because you don't trim this grass then all this leaves you never clear it except all these leaves and
can collect water one
no there is there is so tiny dot on the water you never dry out right
can breed mosquito one
it's true okay lah but that's not really a problem I guess
ya but I think the biggest benefit now is in china the this
all the the the animal trade the exotic animal all this
they have to really
the businesses have to shut down lah
like before this there was there wasn't any like regulation on exotic animals in china
but at least it's one step ahead I feel lah at least now there is a rule before there's really no rule at all
so whether they enforce it or not ya
ya
you know but the article say like twenty thousand farms were forced to close and shut down I think that's a good start like twenty thousand farms like a lot leh
is it
aren't we not at the top
oh we're not the predator
I don't know
the animal kindom we are probably one of the lowest lah
but we have brains though they got no brain I mean they have brains but they are not intellect
ya I mean they they can do always fight for survival defining this thing in nature
ya
ya okay
no okay then I think it'll be issue also imagine like this twenty thousand farm closed down already these animals where do they go you know like
ya so what's gonna happen to this animal
it's that not easy you know
that they can't give the animals like tickets to go home on themselves
they probably gonna like
I don't know
or maybe they do a clearance sale I don't know
everything must go right I mean I don't know like
there's also the vail is not releasing back to the wild I guess I mean it you can visit back to the wild but
you have to know where to put it back to lah but it's not possible lah per se
oh my god
oh that one that they kill all the animal ah but cause the one all is affected infected with the coronavirus what ya yes yes
they carry it on their body
so it's spread through the minks
they have to kill all the the chickens mah
I think until now nobody knows where it's from right
ya
yes
mm
uh huh
ya inside the middle ah
uh huh
ya ya ya isn't that the cheese err ah swiss cheese plant
stop it lah
what's your other plant how's your other monstera doing your current monstera
but you at the at the latch right
what's the per buying put it outside
put back inside
five times leh
what is a prayer plant
mm
ya
mm
but monstera is an indoor plant what right
it's just need a little like
sun
I thought you need the evening sun or something
mm
ya
ya
technically they are bushes lah weeds
ya so you have been blocked by the trees right they are being shaded right
ya
ya
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
not really leh
ya
no but first life I think very short always wilt leh
but you know I was talking to one of terrence friend he study plants he's like a farmer lah but he's not farmer but
he said actually all these plants right
when they say like it's good for your
err the air the in the room all these I actually just flexible if that kind like because they don't emit enough to actually cause a a difference like unless you have like ten hundred like a hundred monstera in your room kind then yes you can feel so actually one of this talk leh like it doesn't make a difference actually
ya so you just make yourself feel better
good job ya that's fake by the way
cause the sun ever come in so we come back and rear plants
but need a bit of sun also what light can ah
ya
mother in laws tongue
ya I know
can ah
ya probably can lah I don't know
I don't know it just grows short lah from small to big lah I guess shoots ya
hais
no oh my god that one
no meh
I thought you called spraypaint to do or something
yup
ah
mm
the humidity very dense right very cold
you're not the plant you don't what it's feeling should we die during night you know like screaming in pain for like the next eight hours
but know all you think about is aesthetics you don't care about the plants feelings
I think the safest plants are those you see in the office
offices that have plants right is safe because it's been tested to survive in office uh condition which there's aircon and not enough sunlight kind
aiya very the
I think you know if you see but don't know what plant is discovered but it's a very common plant
ya something like that
aiya you don't know one lah
why
cause iron can scoop you can put your steak on it
mm oh my god
mm
hais
mm
spray is it then
mm
ah
ya ya of course you can't pour on the leaf though
mm
ya
okay technically it's commercial so they have to make it last for very long the water I guess
no as long as you do drainage right it's okay ya because in awhile also what if rain you can't stop the rain right ya most of the time it's drainage so you cannot cover the base like what you did that time go plastic wrap at the tulle scotch tape
mm
no depend not off plus you can do that or not
I guess I mean you can go out plant
mm ya
ya you can't water you everyday if not will die sia
hmm
oh my god it's so expensive though
it's like I don't know the price
ya you better up your green fingers first
enough lah too much plants ah mosquitoes moving around
you got a lot of mosquito then a lot of ants all those and insects start coming in
because you talk the wildlife standard plant standard issue plant eh
oh no
aiya you don't know one lah
it's like a fern anyway
hais
you don't have class so what you gonna do tomorrow

naz again
it I don't know what to buy for her it's like running of ideas you know there's no theme can buy anything it's just have to be like more than thirty dollars or something like that
cannot be less than thirty
ya then it's like cannot be less than
but technically they don't like understand why is it called like you know inflation and then
err haven't planned yet eh for everything leh
socks
mm
ya
why
oh my god
oh my god stop it it's so funny
oh what's full time ah oh
oh
wah my full time ah
ya
definitely
how old is she ah
mm

ya
but then I feel like december kan school holiday
mm ugh
mmhmm
Pan Pacific service suite
um beach road
because you all going as a family so I thought like you'll be
better
it'll be better to have
an apartment instead of
a normal hotel room
mmhmm
then
then before that
then before that like before check in or after check in do you plan to do anything
in pacific
how many
because of the number of adults that you book kan
that's why they follow like
ya
eh eh sorry sorry
mmhmm
I think it's easy seh if you get like central
a'ah
because I thought like if you know if we have if we go for apartment instead of normal hotel then
oh
mm
is that the kitchen then
and then
uh
ya
like that's what I thought
because since
he's awkward either way
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya correct
oh
I think you should go I think with kids is fun
and because that time then that time she draw a butterfly and then the butterfly that she draw just fly around
ya I think since you got like a child maybe that is maybe that's fun
if not I can find for you also lor
that around december but I'm not sure when exactly but I'm guessing it's december it'll be credited to your SingPass
then like make use of that lor
or maybe if you not using that as a
I mean for your hotel then I think you can use for your activities
ya
hundred dollars
ya my
uh huh
sea aquarium
adventure cove
ya
then can also
then they have that lazy river
but then do you think angah will
this hotel also nice
have you gone before
I think you went before
oh is it
ya
because it's too malay
I mean like since
since angah like
I forgot it was a while back
like few years it's like a while back
a while back
mm can ah
at Noosh Noodle Bar
eh we have the same thing
we can quiet for too long
mm okay
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
you went so far and you ate you went to japan
to eat a
crazy ah
I also don't really like japanese curry
ya
maybe they like it because
that's their idea of curry like our idea of curry is different
ya so when I tasted aside he set up
in singapore dollars
ah okay
mmhmm
but then I feel like if you go eat overseas I think you don't even
feel like you're spending too much of money on like food
it's like I think I don't think you will mind
did you had the
Luke's Lobster
why didn't you eat it's so good
thing it's overflowing it's marvellous
so actually if you convert it's like twenty
ya
so it's actually pretty similar but because you
if you like craving for it just go for it lah twenty plus dollars
because I think they have like fixed
um measurement on how many how much lobster to put on the bun
then that time also I had this yakiniku you know yakiniku
the beef
Yoshinoya
oh no okay yakiniku is the
okay lah like that is after they yakiniku the beef mah
but yakiniku is basically you get
to grill the the beef
maybe because they yakiniku it in the kitchen you you don't get to do it
but ya
that
that time there was only one halal yakiniku outlet
the asakusa temple area
ya
it's so nice one of the set was wagyu then I'm like
it's so soft oh my god
I don't know when we get to go to japan again I'm so sad
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
I think
I mean it is technically lah but
okay dish
dish I think I would pick
like
let's see is soup like a dish
ya ya ya it is it is a dish
so that means like mee soto is that a dish
do you consider that a dish okay then I will pick
no I won't choose mee soto okay I think I will pick
um
a'ah there's like so many things that I like
hmm
I don't know
let me see let me think
he if given a choice
I would probably choose a seafood dish though
chicken
garlic
so good
want to eat ya true alright
okay
ya that's a dish
if you get a chance to wake up as an actor one day which actor would you
want to become and why
you will eh she eh she got so many business
okay let's change it to celebrity
ya lah so celebrity who's
ya you have your own beauty line
some more you recently if you're rihanna you recently released the
the lingerie line
experience
a'ah
a'ah seh
maybe she got servants
she imaging the sleepover party
oh my god
a'ah
like got
don't know
ya
ya then after that I think he used
he used
and then they put there as a meme
oho like the circuit breaker
a'ah
ya
was like I'm
you all have to stay home today but the celebrities
oh my god
a'ah
that's why
a'ah
and then they have
a'ah movie room ya
I think probably we have the right to complain
aiya I think it'll be fun
can you imagine
like I cannot imagine myself
staying in that kind of house but okay
I would like to try
what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
buy one get one free you get one
like the worst
thing to have buy one get one free
ever
I think it's
a bad thing ya
a'ah
mmhmm mm mm
ah
ya so that's one of the bad ones
lower on is free
but I actually find that ya I find that a fair deal
then ah if they like talking about things then I feel like I cannot think of any as of now
um
good looks
ya I feel like I choose good looks also
like the that like uh
a'ah
because like how do I say like good fit body you can train to get it
face
face is
at your head so I don't think like you know you can have like
err you still not a
uh huh
I like crime documentaries
a'ah a'ah
court cases
mmhmm correct
fight for their clients you no no no like he or she is not wrong
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya ya ya
right
popular
they still show but I'm not sure whether it's new seasons
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ya I think hawk gate horror right I think it's
if the plot case is good
and then I think that um
a'ah
I don't
I don't think
I think paranormal activity is
uh like you know I don't ya
it really happened
a'ah the original camera
so I feel like a bit like okay
tactic
something new
but then recently I've been watching the bailey
bailey's makeup videos
the makeup mystery and murder makeup murder and mystery
but then I feel like she always
bailey she just knows how to like
make sure everybody is not
the longer ones right
there's this one one movie that she told
that there's huh
that she covered
uh huh a'ah ah
I haven't really watch
uh
mm kids
oh the movie is just recently
oh okay okay okay okay okay
oh okay
crime documentaries but then there's so many to watch
mmhmm
stress
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
and she effectively you know
expecting
mm
okay I will watch soon I think tomorrow
I would wish for
what I would wish for
I think first things first I wish for no poverty in the world
and then
is there something that you always wanted to
something that you wanted for like so long
this can happen you wish
mmhmm
or is it
okay like when you
ah okay okay
a'ah a'ah
true
castle
like
a'ah
like your own land
with a swimming pool and then you can have a tennis court badminton court
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think everybody
I think primary school
but then it
oh
mmhmm
SARS is just singapore
I don't expect
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
father daughter or like kids
mmhmm
what is it oh your your
father is infected with COVID so
I think uh
it's the same I think for now
one of the wish is always to have
a mask-free
I'm waiting for the day that we can go mask-free
like finally
I think like oh
I think like
like he
I'm like one step closer to going to finally going I guess
be hygienic
you're not contributing you know then not even safe
okay
a duh
oh ya ya ya
sembawang
who
he's like so young
ya
ya
ya very funny right
ya I feel like it's so weird
interning gag
grants and all that
I don't think that's a long long term thing
ya I guess
a'ah
a'ah
that's why because I'm
I'm not even an intern but then they
because I think it's like
because
that's why they don't let us do that kind of things
ya then we just answer we just answer like enquiries lor
like let's say okay mainly is about passion card lah
I think they like
people
from other working at other places eh like customer service wise right if they
okay for example SingPost
the other time they refer a resident to the
grant
for the self employee
self-employed people
so basically not all grants is under lah then after that they
I think people who don't
visit their community centre often they don't know that
not everything is
ya
so when they
oh um we actually this this grant is not under us so
ya but then they are the one who refer us here why you cannot help us so I was like
okay they referred you here without knowing that the cannot do all these
because it's also what
like
to apply for these grants you have to login your SingPass SingPass
if can
ya our own public computer to
login to your SingPass because it's mah
I mean like okay lah if you allowed there's there's
I feel like some people should be
understanding about this issue
the other day
the other day uh
the right
they referred this resident to
to the to change their address their
ya1
ya
it's so weird right like should know that they are the ones who do all this
ya
so they refer in
so when they refer it when we refer right and I was like ya we can change we can change your uh at the but then it will
it will take like a few days
but then if you want like immediate then you can go to the then I'm like huh
like it's actually weird this kind of things actually happen the other day got also got resident they come to the and they like
uh can you help me look for a house
ya they really they really come to the to
ask for everything they ask for literally everything
so like
imagine the amount of time spent to explain to them that
hmm)(hmm
not everything we can do at
so funny
and then some people they understand lah but then you know some people when they like
a'ah
that's why I say
ah
because now
now also everything is online
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
need to go down mmhmm
a'ah
ya it's like that so yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
that was the life every day literally
so the other time also
the other time also there was this one
there was this one resident
the um financial assistance for the mum and then just recently
as in the application that the application for the
is the one who is supposed to receive the financial assistance right
the she passed away so she asking like if can transfer under his name
then I said cannot lah because your situation and your mum situation is different you all not listed living in the same address
but
I'm related to her she's my mum why can't I have the money instead
ya
then like that ya it's a needs it's hard it's hard to please everybody
especially if it's like
racial
and then I couldn't help right for example with their their grants or whatever
and then they always said things like
ya and I'm like it's not that
ya exactly
so they gonna play they're gonna play the race card also
that's what I thought like okay I'm not gonna
remain in the for a bit any longer
because by right I use
mm ya
at the
ya
ya
ya so it's not exactly in the dormitory but in their office
so like if the
issues with the
employers
ah
because they um employees from different different company mah so that means let's say if the employer don't want to like
uh
then when I went to the interview they said to be mentally prepared
because it's super crowded I'm like oh
I like okay
but but then I'll be in the office what
just be mentally prepared lor
mm
no lah
mmhmm
they didn't decrease the pay for them
then your diploma when start
dah
that time you went for the medical interview ah
you went already
ya
ya the immunity is lower lah basically
oh okay
oh really
oh okay
oh it's at a landed property
oh okay okay I think I seen
it's a child care
oh okay then how many
children you have in there
so do people like teach
over there or no

oh okay and then mixed race like japanese and ang moh like um japanese and get japanese korean and sweden that swedish within
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
uh
oh

it was interesting it's just that my special ya like I said lah are my specialisation was red cross knowledge and first aid I was gonna take an evac gold but
I
I got sick I got sick during my first aid goal and my evac gold the test because we had to go to the to take the like test lah but I was sick I couldn't make it so I was like I only had like
everything was bronze except for my ah red cross knowledge ah I found it I was sad but at the same I didn't give a
I didn't care
I mean at that time lah I mean who cared lah right
eh what was your scene secondary school
first school
mmhmm
oh captain's ball
cook right
you didn't have to take home econs as a subject no eh for us it was compulsory everyone had to take home econs D&T

uh huh
uh huh
shit your basic really zero
stay in stay in beat ah
oh

oh ya the the
I had to learn in primary school
recorder ah the long one flute is at the side ha then uh
oh ya then in secondary school my school ask us to learn gamelan I I I was in charge of the big gong
not the big gong is like one side is smaller than the other side is bigger you know that what oh no it's the I I at first I was gong I was in charge of the gong

tchoukball or something is it the one you throw them net they had through at the net
I don't remember floorball tchoukball I don't remember ya I mean we did play uh captain's ball a lot I was always the goalkeeper
cause I was great at catching balls I was good at no pun intended but ya ya ya I played a lot frisbee uh I played basketball in secondary school then rugby was like my final like touch rugby was my final
we learn
okay lah
that's why in like you know secondary school I was so fit then the moment I went to poly I gained so much weight because I didn't do the same amount of physical activity I was eating I was still having like unhealthy lifestyle I slept like like irregular eat irregularly also ya it's okay now I can tell people I tried a lot of things that's why I tell people what I'm a jack of all trades master of none
but ya I think primary school and secondary school there's a lot of like ghost stories sia ya especially you know you go to camps
do you do you have any camps like do you guys have any like
ha okay you continue
oo
mm
we loved it
yes
is it that's not really horror though more of thriller right it's the it's the kid who pretended to it's the adult who pretended to be a kid right because she had some disorder right
oh
oh shit
ah
it's it's like haunted house lah kan it's like it's like during our camp lah kan
yikes
faci faci
he stare at you no I mean for me my night walk I mean I had a I had like camps lah primary school
what is it ah
one of the the the the guys right one of the army one of the army stories
no not the not the one that the guy died with the the not with the intestines all over the floor one it's the other one is the the one that he offended the offerings or something then
ya because he mummy boy ya that place lah the that that place they used as like the no it was at a camp I don't remember but I think it's now closed is it sarimbun is sarimbun closed I don't remember it was I think sarimbun because I remember sleeping on those bunks
ya but ya when I had those night walks right it was
okay because night walks right what they did was that the line the route with glow sticks tau
they line the route with glow sticks then the
the like you are free to walk ah
it started out fine but right it's like
like when how say eh uh
it started out fine but it's like err when we came back from like to go back to the campsite right
I was like walking normally you know like you know you walking normally right like are there was nothing for me to trip on or like off or something I felt like something grab my ankle then I slipped
everyone was showered
everyone finished showering already
kan if you think about it because we took a shorter cut
creeped the heck out of me
aik
mm
yikes
they just stayed there lah so bad in everything smelt then the house smelt
no they say that
LOL
uh huh cause I watched that one
mmhmm
it's not painful
it's not painful and I mean it hurts your soul but not on your face I guess err I don't know lah I mean allahu alam ah eh
that's why I say I don't know you go Google lah I don't know what else ah
to stay young
right I I remember I remember a lot of stories where they say that they eat babies to stay young
people correct
ya ya I don't want to talk about it who knows they're talking the thing will I mean I mean
no it's
islam
welcome it I know when you give birth the one who will help you give birth midwife midwife I mean uh you hear stories that sometimes inside the
mm they see extra people inside the room when they
figure or figures of things like that because my mum said when she was pregnant with me right eh no not with me with my eldest brother she was disturbed quite a lot inside the hospital
taking it lah
I don't know maybe
but then again there's a lot of deaths in hospitals also so mm I guess understandable never wanna become a nurse or doctor fuck no
mm
mm
can you imagine like maybe I don't know
I don't know
I I told my mum if they're gonna like disturb me at my house also I'm gonna be like whatever I'm so tired I'm too tired I'm not getting enough
I don't I don't have I don't get enough sleep for me to deal with your bush
ya let me let me get some sleep first you come you you set appointment and you come back no because that time during I I
it prevents you get getting disturbed in your sleep but it's not when you are awake
different story it can go into your dream also what they say
that's why sometimes if you dream about something I don't know is it a like I mean a lot of like while uh psychological study said that oh it's just like uh was it what seh
they said that if it's pigments about fragments of life brought into your dream or something then they intensifies it or something but then again some dreams are so wild that you are ya that you can't help but to think
like you said what they can uh what is it ah they can show themselves to you or make themselves shown or something they manipulate your brain so like you think you see them
ya but then again right I feel like
it's because there are it's aiming you
but you know what I hate the most is sometimes right they aiming for you but they disturb someone around you
ya like they use they played other people to get to you
I was sewing at night ya I was sewing for my friend like like a kimono cardigan at night lah around four
what
no shit oh hell no ya but but I think a lot of the if you
correct correct then why you think who who pull my leg when I walk in the in the jungle what the heck right then all like when they throw things they move things
like the ya the paranormal activity kind of things right but I mean some of them are they faked they want views but some of them are not scared the heck out of me
with a camera right
ya like come here I'm already here for you come on baby oh my god ha
mm that's why ah
then suddenly she she was like she saw the chair move
like spin a bit she got scared she stand up and walk then when she was running for the uh door she got pulled back thrown thrown to the wall then like the the chairs and tables all like shifted
it was damn scary malaysia lah you singapore singapore I feel like singapore no matter how how haunted right cannot match like indonesian or like in malaysia I don't I don't know I feel like maybe because smaller
but it
the modern the more modern is it the the more religious you are the less likely you are to take over
I think oh I don't know I do know there some bomohs in singapore I think it's more of because we are more we are more religious like we are more modernise ah
mm
ya then I guess the I mean even your boob getting a boob job would like I guess you won't you won't I guess it won't expo and stuff lah but ya
I mean I mean
I mean like okay lah it's temporary or unless you like accidentally poke it or you're like what I don't know
is it ya oh because it will like corrode or something is it oh ya ya
okay
but ya
I don't know some
ah ya something like that I'm not sure
some people don't
or like or like or like if the wind blows right I got a I got a I got to brown my hair before my head
but this ya
err accord sort is it they show you stuff
like and stays forever
ya boy
mmhmm
but
the most people can they say you cannot die right you cannot die when
I don't know
not I think I think you'll be on the brink of death but never die
until you take it out or if you even if you die you are like finally die
you get it ya you like because you know right there's this like they say when you die
just because you your eyes are closed your heart stops beating your soul is not out of the body you can still feel everything
so basically imagine your daughter cries
you can hear everything you can feel everything it's just that you can't react
that's sad that's not scary that's sad
ya I think there'll be so frustrating you imagine your your mum hugging you and crying but you can't respond
I think I'll be sad I'll be so sad
ha
I don't know I mean depends on the family uh because you are unless
you not supposed to say this lah but unless the
pass to you
no lah what you wouldn't know unless you experience it
ya I think so it's an agreement lah basically you are agreeing what if you nod it's a form of agreement what no matter
like the thing picks its master
so like and
probably it will probably follow you around
how to say eh
I
lame okay and my mum said lah my mum said lah eh she said that the thing picks a master that is like
for real

it is today
well maybe they will only let direct families because now from from four right four to eight
then eight
is like
direct families
probably will be like less than fifteen
in like maybe a parent's house but I think like have like distant relative cannot ah too risky
okay
okay let's go back to the renovation plans ya so you say that we must do it as soon as possible
uh how about this month I think we should start to meet the or wait I think we should start research first right
I don't know I I have a lot of ideas actually but I haven't got the time to collate yet but uh
I think I want to do like a mood board I think ya mood board
so that I can show the contractor visually because I'm a visual person so I need to show them visually so that they know what I'm talking about
and then I think it will be it will be better it will give a better understanding to the to look at photos instead of just verbally telling them right
WhatsApp
you know like the english one the not contemporary ah english kitchen contemporary
I want a open concept not say open concept like style like people can see from outside
like can see the kitchen from the hall or living room but what I mean open concept is that there's minimal wardrobe because our house is like
so humid is easily mould so
I think the lesser the cabinet wardrobe not wardrobe cabinet the lesser the cabinet will be better
uh uh lah okay lah then I I have to agree with you lah we go we put the partition that means
eh ya lah correct lah when I say open concept it doesn't mean
open concept as in we hack the wall like that's not what I mean what I meant was
open concept as in minimal wardrobe as in
the kitchen is still there but I have this idea
to make the kitchen look bigger we have to
put the you know like those bar top counter
like um
ah like you know kitchen service usually they will
they will they will prepare the food and then after that they will serve it through the waiter through that counter ya maybe you can get that idea
we can find that idea for our kitchen instead
you think I'm a waiter
chey private cook
private cook then like that I must I must I must prepare the all the what receipt lah all that lah so that you are like my customer like that at home
funny ah
ya I know I know okay okay let's let's not deviate from the actual topic again okay so where were we we were at the kitchen right kitchen area
ya so how do you you okay or not with that idea
that bar top counter wiped out of the
ya
ya that's a good idea right ya like uh
anyway because when I'm cooking is always like so gloomy and dark inside the kitchen so at least
if there's that that little partition then light light can come in you know like make the kitchen look brighter
and then
mm
okay that's settled but I think we shouldn't use the word open concept because I scared the will
uh mistook it for the open concept like those did the open concept means
means there's no wall or half wall ya so I think we just tell them we need we want that partition
uh or like you say the hole in between ya
okay
mm
eh but the other day I went through um this hard zone or something lah the website right
like people write reviews on renovation and stuff then I happen to come across uh this person
uh he wrote he wrote that he did the platform for bedroom
and then plus something else lah then it's already two K
just the platform
mm
I put uh under
uh extra budget column
in the planning lah so but then we okay like that we settle the needs first rather than the wants
the needs I think there's quite a few okay the kitchen and then ah the service balcony you know the
the doorway um between the service balcony and the kitchen there's the there's the grills uh window right window grills so
I thought I want to hack one segment of it so that the door will be bigger and then again the kitchen will be brighter
right
ya because now now the window is the old style one right the flip one because is to for the air to go in and out but then
if let's say we replace with glass
there won't be anymore air coming in and out but because we already hack half of it what so
actually the air in and out will come from by via the door instead of the window you know so I think should be okay ah
mm
actually not bad leh you know my ideas which I come out like just visually in my mind like I haven't do any research yet
then the things that I've told you before right like any ideas I have to do this and that uh different parts of the house
actually it can be done because after I do research
wah I really find some pictures on Instagram and all that like really have the idea visualise
uh came to real life you know really eh so actually my idea is valid so you must trust my ideas
no that's not what I meant what I meant is when I go and
like look through like renovation company they always upload their portfolio and their
their houses that they already renovated so
when I look through then some parts like bits of here and there like example I wanted a like uh extendable
counter top which I don't even know whether it can be done I I know there's the fixed one but I don't know whether it can be the extendable one like those
table we saw but this one is the quartz top kitchen top so
and then and then there's one time I really saw the picture there's some there's a house that did the same thing so it can be done
ah
okay so after the kitchen so balcony so balcony anything else oh ya of course the window we have to change the whole house because
there's too many insects and that's like
err like the window grill I don't know
so but then that one I haven't research uh
but uh ya
I think I think it's because ah it's already old lah that's why the insect can come in but actually supposed supposedly not what it's supposed to be tight what like fit
fit to measure measure to fit I don't know
made to measure
ya
then you remember the uh the other day I told you
I found out the window
there's this one capping went off and then that's why the lizard can come in and out of the house
because there's a huge hole so easy for them to come in and out
that's the thing that's why must renovate because
you see all the trunking and the electrical uh wiring the trunking for the electrical wiring
there is like so many holes these lizards like holes like outside our house also
I tell you you must go and tell our
go and write a letter and tell them to put something the killer the insect trap I mean the lizard trap
because they have been breeding over inside the trunking of the wires you know
hello who are you talking to my wife is in front of you
are you okay
ya lah that's why I told you then every night there's this super loud
I think the lizard have grown from small to big you know seriously because
ya that's why I tell you our house is like already really time for
it's not that I don't want to cook for you but it's because sometime the fear you know the fear
hinders me from staying in the kitchen very long so that's why sometime I want to
wash the plates like late at night I'm too scared it's not that I lazy or what you must understand that is because you know the
the the the knowledge that there's there's a lizard inside the kitchen and it's super near it's just below the stove
makes me have that like phobia lah because
because I know it's big it's not a small lizard
so imagine if suddenly appear the other day I
you you heard me the other day you heard me right almost I almost cried right because
the lizard just suddenly super loud at my ears and then like like I'm like so shock okay
I'm so shocked and terrified and you know I got phobia with all these insects
ya so you better do something
I ask you to call pest control also you haven't call right
it's not about time it is the time you remember renovaid we watch don't wait until our kitchen become like the renovaid
uh recipients
eh but eh but you know what there's a new series of renovaid channel five belinda back you know
they took belinda as the host back yay belinda very good compared to the other hosts
hello people watch renovaid to watch the house ah you watch the host ah hello
more thin
okay later you see her you go and ask her okay
eh but the new season uh the other day I was uh randomly uh looking for right
and then I saw uh one of the actually posted the renovaid advertisement so I think they are the one who will handle the
um the renovation this time round this season because the the previous season it was ah what is it called three D innovations right
ya I think this one this time round is this company aiya I forgot the name but ya later I I show you again
ya I think this time round so maybe we can actually uh watch renovaid few episodes first then after that we can try to meet them then see how
if they their style okay then we can actually meet meet the this same this ah if not actually uh three D innovation is good leh
the only thing I'm concerned is that ours is not a the big project not the
not those above twenty five K so three D is like quite reputable but then
but then if to think back they actually do for
do for the low
uh what do you call that low income families eh
then maybe though I don't know I'm not sure maybe can just try inquire them ah because our
but looking at our renovation we we want to do the whole house but we don't have the budget so
ours is considered the small budget lah maybe we can start with the kitchen plus two toilet plan first then maybe we see how if the
that's a lot of things we actually just replace also right like what ah you remember
tap
I remember he I remember he came
he didn't come for few weeks so funny the story I remember he came
he he was he disappeared a few like he for a few months right then after that we ask
when is he coming back because there are still some things incomplete or not proper lah okay it's actually complete but not proper only so
still need to be modified and stuff then we we keep asking him to come back and then he
say postpone postpone then eventually when we come back
imagine when he came back uh
oh we didn't even say anything but he himself say that uh we we call
ya but his job also not proper really and then now not even like three years eh the toilet you see the
the flooring the tiles in the toilet there's like white patches and then the
what do you call that the uh what not grout grout is what not the grout what you call that
not the cement the one the white colour one in between
the one they use to glue the tile that one
uh wear and tear already when you want ya
we should just call handyman seh to install our this one the only thing that he helped is the
the re-piping only lah that one okay lah but even so uh remember the
the also not proper
hollow eh
it's not supposed to be like that
and then remember we actually paid a more expensive tile and then is nicer and then
even though it's more slippery but it's still for toilet we ask what we ask the tile person right
he say for toilet but then and then he claimed
uh and then after that when the day comes he suddenly bring his own tile then what for he ask us to go to hafari right
then ah then after that mm
either that or he know that he never do correctly lah he maybe if he never cut properly or what it's not like wastage
because if it's an expensive of course we will we will count him account him accountable what right because ya it's a expensive tile
mm
ya but the good thing but the good thing we had this contractor at least is a experience for us like the next time you know what to look out for already
actually actually we also don't know right we want to pick the contractor or the right but then you see both also got pros and cons so we just
hope lah we just hope we get a good one that's why I say research very important that's why I tell you even though I ask you
we meet uh already but doesn't mean we select this month actually it's just to compare quotation because
the first appointment it will be free and then they will give out the quotes
they give us a quote at least we know uh like we compare with other
so we know already actually this price actually come for which which which component like
is it the uh is it the accessories or
ya is it the tilings is it everything so at least you can compare what is the market price you know
ya so actually the more we go and survey also the better it's not it's not about making you feel confused or what it's not for is not the case
because really it will help you in the quotation
ya
hopefully that one will reduce the cost ah cause
ya because every because the quotation is every single item they will list down for you
so every single thing that we can checklist uh off like check no check tick off
tick off means you already have ah that one already save save save save then that's where it will come to the total cost
so if we can actually we can actually save back that two K that we did for our toilet also good enough already
ah
ah package ya two standard
mm
mm
ya and after that ya
and
ya then the
oh double
ah
ya and then now this renovation I don't know if they can take out and then put back the same one
but anyway if uh whatever it is also we can call back the same we can tell them we want the same uh the same supplier
then they will deal with the contractor or actually don't need uh
they will give us the timeline then we will just inform our own uh contractor for the vinyl right
ah when they can come over and do this but I think can take out because ours is the click click function right
ah
ya it is the newest click function that one right
ya is a new technology that time click and all that's why you think you can do your own vinyl remember
that's why you thought you want to do your own one but how can I told you we must cut it according to the measurement
how you you how you cut
ha
ah
ya that's why later it will chip off like the one in uh kids room
oh
ya
eh mm
I remember while we met the the company
I remember we met the company
I remember we when to the company uh he mentioned actually the more we do the the cheaper they will give what remember
and then because we got no budget at that point of time
mm
ya
K but
but that time that time but now since you also want to do for the hall right the hall I cannot that one cement is too cold not good for the feet ya
you know uh overlay also cheaper rather than we hack the cement so hall we never hack that one also already cut off from the quotation so good already then
then the kitchen also I thought we do vinyl because I remember they said it was fire is uh I remember is they say it was fireproof right
then kitchen then is easily clean eh you want you want to consider kitchen vinyl vinyl
hmm
vinyl
mm
cause we have to think how like we are really can can clean easily right
but vinyl cannot pick the one that has many groove this one remember this one got two option we this one is still the cheaper one then there's one more the the most move one without lesser groove
ya
maybe that one cannot see the whole kitchen because kitchen
later will have oil splat and all that you know so it can go in between then ya bacteria you know
maybe want to consider later can go the showroom again then we see the different if there's not much different then okay we just stick to the old one
but if there's a lot of different then we we should go for the one with the smoother lesser ah grooves
ya because kitchen there's a lot more stuff you know
and then any ya all this splat and all that if it's in between and then we never clean it properly is all bacteria some more kitchen has to be the cleanest place
mm
ya of course but if is there's more groove then it will be harder because even if you use you know now we are using that that water mop right the
mop uh water sucking mop what
that one that one you won't go into the groove
ya lah it suck water the mop suck water right
ah
okay water absorbing mop
oh
oh that one
that one very expensive that one is mop plus vacuum
ya wireless is good but ah make sure it's not heavy some heavy like Dyson last time the older one very heavy
but Dyson don't have that two function you know it's famous eh that two function mop plus vacuum
it's famous
after after the renovation
not sucking water absorbing mop
ya but the sponge also very old uh oh now you change to three M already I thought the I thought the one you bought at japan home
ya now is the three M one but the the sponge is so expensive to refill right
huh difficult have what
but but better than the japan home
better than the japan home one you go and find no
only that brush sial no wonder on sale then after that clearance
other branch don't have
refill
ah
okay so uh actually oh I forgot to tell you I uh I sign up through Renopedia
and then um through there there will be contacting me ah like they ask me to fill in my details just like that
they even uh ask me to select the budget how much we there's a few selection lah so
I I click I click on one of them the the one follow our following our budget
and then like the that instruct interest interested
then will contact us lah through either through mail or WhatsApp ya so I don't know I just feel that maybe through Renopedia then at least like more reliable or what
I don't know because because if let's say the companies doesn't do well then it will reflect back also to Renopedia what right
so is all go back to our own research ah
actually they say um doesn't mean the very the company eh very reputable can be trusted means it's good
actually it's back to the individual so doesn't
so I'm not supposed to just list shortlist the uh company but I must also research uh and
look for the specific
ya
because ya because sometimes they say the also may
ah hop companies
correct
ya we can we can request you know when we go down to their showroom or their
ya correct
we can select one
and then uh also don't pay anything first
okay so
ya so after this I will
show you the mood board I do the mood board I go buy the cardboard and then I'll do the mood board then I show you
then err
I already shortlisted the that like
I don't know like maybe we can go uh down and uh have a appointment with them
I shortlist a few already other than the one Renopedia give lah
ya uh but I haven't show you then I I even I even uh wrote down their names the
uh
so this saturday how about this saturday saturday we are free
you want go for our first appointment
oh ya
remind me to buy the
ya ya correct because I also need time actually I I need to repair the mood board first before we go down what
mm
it must be a balance ah we don't we don't want that only listens to what we want
but also suggest things whatever that can be improved
and also not those who only one they're designed to be
ah to be turn into reality ya but then don't want to listen to our requirement because now our renovation is a need because of certain things in the house

apparently if you do your wedding under the void deck now you only get two hours
ya two hours so she's like but no forget it
ya that's why she changed her mind lah so she did it at home
singapore flyer
really
she's only doing it cause her mother and father there
I think if I ever do get married
I want like I don't want a big wedding either but
let's say let's say hypothetically speaking ah
there is no way in hell that man will want a small wedding
ya because he has people like
overseas it's not just people here leh
really man my ex wanted a fucking big wedding sia and I'm like
I don't understand how some girls can have like twelve bridesmaids
I don't even have twelve friends
don't know what corporate bridesmaid keeper ran to like how are you even forking out money for like of people too right
right
kan
like how how do you even have twelve friends who are
supposingly like ya
like how I don't understand sial like I think about it ah I only got five friends I can count on and that's it the numbers stops there it doesn't grow I don't want new friends I don't care for it

private area at rumours for a birthday party I need it for a friend I'm like
err no guarantees but sure
ya
kan
he just has to book what
ya he can just book and it's not even that like now you want to book also it's not going to be as fun as that time
cause there are so much more stricter there are so much more stricter now
we went before like all that shit went down lah we went before the
the social distancing people even went there
ya
ee
I I think babe it's in july it was in july
start already lah but they were still like not very serious about the rules there
by six you have to pack up and leave you cannot stay later than six and then all the beach clubs close at like eight o'clock now apparently
ya so we got very lucky
kan
you lah busy
okay what's the date
but
it's like
mm
huh
ah
we can
we can do twelve
ya twenty six too far cannot twelfth is perfect
ya twelve is perfect
I don't even know how you broke your phone that day you know I really don't
I wasn't even drunk that day I just don't get how you oh I think I know when
when you was getting at andre's lobby and you fell remember
your phone didn't fold in half lah the screen just crack lah
try we I should just wait so you mean she at home you get ahead you they they can repair or ability or or go with their iphone or cold air cool white apron sky then err I don't know last night eh I really don't know eh you give exists food opposite the airport who got a C is you know what
I don't know
I really don't know how you broke your phone I cannot like to this day sometimes I really like think about it tau I retraced you know like every single thing we did that day
not once did we see your phone come out eh
huh
you're not that troublesome to me ah
all you had was one glass sial
wake boarding
you know my swimming skills are so terrible
my swimming skills a very terrible
I will still be able to drown trust me
I think so ah you know when I went to phuket right then I wanted to go snorkeling very badly because I really like the sea I love the beach I love the sea I like being in water but cannot swim for nuts I can only swim if my feet can touch the ground serious then we went to I went to phuket right with my ex ah then
we book all snorkeling trip know going to island island hopping right so we went to like maya bay and all that then the first island was in the middle of the freaking sea leh
cry lah damn sad sia then andre tried to teach me swimming in his pool
I cannot take it why do you have hiccups now
are we allowed to like pause the recording
probably
eh I want to henna dye my brows also leh
I lazy sial want to draw
syed's gonna what
why
ya
mm
he don't know how to find job is it
huh
oh
the irony
the freaking irony
panels
mm
I think there's a there's like a there's like an experiment eh where you get paid for just sleeping
ya
wah I'll be great and that sia andre sure sia will be good at that
he always he always huh
I don't sleep twelve hours he doesn't sleep twelve hours he only sleeps for five hours babe
and he sleeps very early like whenever I stay that's why like if you like message me in the middle of the night I won't see because I will be sleeping also
wah snowy jingle bells but ya like if he's very tired the earliest right we have gone to bed is nine thirty
it's nine thirty but by three by three he will wake up
mmhmm I always I always cannot sleep like
early when I'm alone
huh
I don't know when I mean when I was with my ex for six years also we never like kinda like I don't understand how couples can do it like we will cuddle for awhile and then we will say good night then we will both turn our separate side
I don't know how but I will wake up to him cuddling it's either I wake to him cuddling or I wake up to him doing work downstairs
or he come up a wake me up with a cup of tea and tell me to wake up
he doesn't I mean he will cook lah once in a while but lately we've been buying err he will go down cause he will go cycling in the morning like he will go cycling at six
I don't know how I don't know where he'd
I don't know where he get the energy from sia he would wake up at like on saturday on like saturday monday and tuesday cause I always stay from like
the saturday until tuesday standard then okay saturday because I will come in the afternoon so he will play football he will play football so tomorrow morning he's going to go play football chances are he went home drunk tonight and he's drunk is not like
every friday he will go out with the boys so saturday sunday monday tuesday's our time right then saturday morning it's either he will play football if you never sign up for football he will go cycling then afternoon I'll come because you know I would not wake up in the morning
every time I plan every time I plan right like I confident know he ask me what time you want to come baby then I say okay ten thirty
babe still asleep right
I cannot so like even today I I'm ask him lah whether he got football not so that I know what time to come by then he said yup I sign myself up for torture session tomorrow's in the morning so you can stay a bit longer
there are things to do you just got to find it how about you guys go cycling
oh so he cannot cycle okay wait let me think what other things
kickboxing but then don't kick ah just box
that's what me and andre do too it's either cycling or kickboxing or gym that's what we do
so you must you must you must force you must force him you must do I don't know ah it's like it's a it's a two thanks to tango thing because if you keep allowing the relationship to like flat line right then
you will eventually get to a point where you will like ask yourself right is this really all we do
ya
ya so like it's very important like andre has a friend who's been like complaining about how like oh he's marriage is like failing and like how his him and his wife don't do anything anymore and andre just told him one thing like me
in a marriage like in any like relationship it's very important to always like do new things or like do things together because
it's the way a relationship is supposed to be like if you don't bring her out on a date then of course she's not going to dress up for you or anything like that
but I don't know why he's telling me ya
I mean just because he has that like it doesn't mean dinner has to stop like you can always do something at home ya like you can have your wine and cheese thing at home
ya see so like it cannot always be like one person like trying to clap if not you just making eh like it's pointless like I told andre because uh last I think last month andre got very like slack when it came to his active lifestyle lah so I felt very bad because a part of me felt like okay maybe it was because of me lah but he assured me he like he say it's not because of me as well I mean like he can always made the decision himself he he he makes conscious choices what anyway so like he told me okay from now onwards he he's gonna start working out again so me as a girlfriend what would a good girlfriend do
like I'm not going I'm I'm I love being lazy I love the bed right but
if I allow myself to like
not even compromise then want kind of a girlfriend will I be sia so I told him like okay I mean I do enjoy cycling in the morning and I don't mind and also do enjoy kickboxing and going to the gym so we can continue doing that and we can just remain active and then even when I'm not with you I will remain active so like you can sort of like inculcate a habit and then that way you won't feel like okay like I'm not doing anything and then at the same time we can always do things together
have to compromise ah
mm
that's the thing about life
why can't he come to yours
syed better wake up better wake up
it's because you are comfortable
it's something familiar what and it's always scarier to start something new so people go back to familiar stuff it's actually why a lot of people cannot leave toxic relationships or like abusive people
cause it's familiar
it's very true
it's because you are so comfortable like already with the person and like you will tell yourself lah like that little voice in your head was sort of like tell you like okay what if you don't find anything like this again or like what if you don't find a better love but that's not true look at me
everybody can have that chance it's really not true like
and people shouldn't stay in places where they are unhappy because eventually over time like there will be resentment building and anger and like just sadness and it's not just healthy for like you is also going to be unhealthy for like the other person and your relationship and then of course more than ever you so like ya people just need to be more aware
and other people like I like I said like if you are in a relationship you need to understand that it's going to take work life is going to get away everybody is going to be busy everybody has work but look at andre andre is freaking busy
and he will still make time for me so nobody has an excuse like there is literally no excuse no excuse
he definitely has been
andre will do work like halfway while I'm there but he will still like once in awhile like let's say on monday monday has to work right so monday he will work from home then if monday he worked from home he will always he were really just concentrate on work and I will let him concentrate on work because it's to be fair he has to work
and I will never like you know like distract him maybe sometimes I will never like I will never like distract him on purpose lah but even then like halfway he will like stop his work and then tell me like come let's go to the pool or like let's go have lunch together or like
snuggle in bed for a while he was still make time so no excuses
like the other day he go in office and then because he went into office right I got nobody to wake me up
then I sleep until twelve sia
right see no excuses my ex used to also be like that like everything was like oh um
I don't need to do this or like date nights were never like there he won't even like take pictures of me or like compliment me
and then he spent most of his days going out with his friends drinking getting drunk coming back late and I will be the one to like constantly imagine me carrying like a man taller than me like back home changing him because he's too drunk to even do shit
I was living your life girl
I was living your exact life I was where you are now
trust trust I was where you were now like literally he will pick a fight with me if he was drunk and I didn't like pick him up
and I will always stay at home I didn't even get to meet any of my friends I didn't get to go out because if I go out he will pick a fight with me things like that like it was so bad like
so
ya
I I really think it's just local men that actually like they just don't think about anything but themselves
my ex wasn't pampered because he didn't have like family he doesn't have a mom he didn't have a dad growing up
and he was made to like literally work his whole life but still
mm same freaking theories ya they they won't bother working you gotta listen to yourself damn you you really have to I mean like
now you may not but I'm very sure eventually you'll get there lah
eventually
you have to place your happiness above like somebody else because if they're not even thinking about your happiness what's the point of thinking of theirs
gotta love yourself more girl
I told you already what tomorrow I'm going gift shopping
on a saturday
but it sure is
upper joo chiat
because chances are but I'm only I'm meeting him at like one what so I'm meeting at one
we will probably like chill at home for awhile
I don't know
that's why gotta find one that will match him
but the other one I'm not sure whether he will have at least a matching shirt I know he got a lot of pink shirts ah but I don't know whether it will look good together I'll see ah I'll see tomorrow see tomorrow also we have to plan the outfit
and then I have to finish writing my speech
yes
I'm I'm very excited to be bringing him to like celebrate another culture that's not even mine
then he eat but it was really spicy for you ah
he eat but he's still white
so like white people kan standard cannot tolerate spicy food
ya man
he's so cute
oh my god that one would kill him
he will just die
I am hungry please don't like talk about food
ya we can do that I've been going to the gym it's the only problem is that we live on literally the opposite ends of singapore
ya we go we go to that one what I mean if you are near the area then ya lah if not it'll be very troublesome for you what
wow I wish you heard yourself girl we should do something healthy together besides drinking but then suggest going to the gym and then going drinking
andre has their beers after football
do it do it then we can we can do kickboxing together
what's his horoscope ah out of curiosity
when is syed's birthday
january what
oh my god it's one day after andre's birthday
the moon sign must be something else the moon and the mercury and the venus must be something else for sure must be something lazy
that's funny because the aquarius and gemini should be able to get along well it's actually mainly why me and andre get along well because like
I mean you are not a gemini lah but your gemini moon is very strong
no it's it's because like it's not just your sun signs what your other signs nearby so he definitely has like more stronger like signs that are much more like prominent in his chart that are lazy
because aquariuses actually love new experiences
and he is very unlike an aquarius like very very
he's getting older andre is forty two
he is such an underdeveloped aquarius
yes do that do things for yourself
that's how you start loving yourself bro
ya
wah
I'm still waiting for them to get back to me
ya and I I I will message them one know in like the last message I got was that ah oh it's still being delayed like it's still processing government agencies are seriously
hmm
it is a stable job but like can you hurry up
ya andre has
I can't wait to travel with andre
we can do that too girl but if I travel with you I know I confirm become mum friend cause you confirm like small kid
yes but you are the one that will get drunk
aiyo
I'm so tired
yes and I still have like things to do after this I cannot go to sleep yet
well I'm allowed to sleep in term just going to wake up at eleven then I'm going to pack my things and then I'm going to go out
my some of my underwear is there

okay ah ayuni how are you
okay uh so today what are we going to talk about
are you okay I think the first one is I saw is europe highlights for eleven days

mm
ya ya

ya
ya fourteen fourteen days or I think lesser maybe lesser because inshriah cannot take like
ya long leave
scottish
so you want to go to scotland right
mm
mm
maybe
yes but the thing is
ya lah you you have to follow tightly to their
to the schedule
okay so why do you want to go to
scotland
okay
so they project the country very well lah in that
interesting noraini
thank you for sharing with me
and
do you know what I see next
it's um a package eleven days and eight nights
and the heading is spectacular scandinavia
ya that was like
last year's planning
yes
ya sweden right eh no
no no I didn't go to
mm mm
yes
I flew to sweden first
ya
so from stockholm I stay a few nights there
explore the city
how fate brought you together
yes and and you know what what they put here
fish market
ulriken cable car it's the one that we took right ulriken and bryggen but bryggen is what is it the along the
coast
bryggen B R Y G G E N
I do
mm
ya
so here they said set off on an epic journey to the nordic countries where you will see the capitals of denmark sweden and norway so I recall that time the the guide right
ask us like what's the
what's um which countries
are in the scandinavian which countries are ya
navia
ya
which as finland
so it's actually denmark sweden and norway
these three are the scandinavian countries
uh
actually colours of the leaves
mm
wait but northern spain
so what are the country
okay
interesting
so he drives I mean
ya actually when that time during the road trip with I mean we engage the driver kan ya
yes
so we can consider chey
or the other alternative
but like what
the not so
but that time you went you oh you went london only
it's okay
oh yes
but eh err portugal is
who ah the
iffah iffah's choice right
is it
ya
she's getting married leh she go with the husband lah
ya
but portugal ya
hais when can we travel ah
uh exact date I'm not sure but I know it's
february um coincides I think with chinese new year
yes
so when is chinese new year
I don't know leh
no I think should be
I think err mid eh
should be mid right
ya I think so
who who getting married
but all in like um
you shouldn't have made that statement
yes I'm from griffiths primary school
come on
ah I don't
maybe if I see the face I can somehow recall lah but
seems familiar
from griffiths primary ah thirty years old also
I need I need to open my primary school year I don't know whether year book or
mm okay
so then the like like you ask like part of the questions you you guys ask is like what's what primary school you are from like how you all know
ya lah griffiths uh primary is the one next to my place ah
ah
no no ya now renamed to angsana
ya
but is it ya the enrolment
angsana griffiths I mean that location is always very low as compared to
ya the other two schools
because they are better schools I guess
ya
maybe like past years like
I don't know maybe or or the teachers there are better I don't know
tiger parents
tiger parent
yes
ah speaking of which
ah
ah
then err
ya
okay lah
ya
so anyway like that ah so I don't know what's the arrangement for her
oh how much is your battery percentage
are you sure
if it's red then you need to quickly get your charger
woohoo
wah
so the kid
but he's not present lah for that two months or he's still orh
orh
ya
but is he like going to like another
school
nearer lah in that sense
yes I think you should maybe it's going to be it definitely it will be better lah because the only considered like the
the trouble is is him right
very good inclusivity
but ya
ya
mm
ya
I think as long as it's kids
you deal with ya
ya
uh ya
oh
ah
ya it's like like you can actually at towards the end of the year the school will actually send us like a form so we can kind of like indicate uh like what's our preference like what subject we prefer to teach
I think I think the head of departments and also I think should be the the principals ah
ya uh head of departments usually they have lesser teaching periods
yes they do teach ya but lesser because they are holding a
leadership role right so theirs it's more like like like helming the
ya
like timetable before it's like one day is only like
maybe three four periods
ya
then the rest all like I don't know lah what they do
you know settle some like don't know lah some urgent stuff
what they will do like they will be tagged for relief teaching eh
ya
I think like can earn up to five
ya
because like normal teachers
orh ah
I think err
normal teachers like around three K four K
depends on again ya because I've seen a payslip before did I told you
ya because like like we our printer at work is like eh I mean my previous school lah
it's a common printer
so and then is like because my current school the printer works as such that you send a printing job then there's a common printer you key in your password and then you will see what's your printing job then you print
ah
ah
mm mm
mm mm
so so what's the ranking actually for for early childhood like
like
teacher
mm
so I mean like there's
wow so deep sia
where you at what you at what you're at now
yes
ah
okay
ah ah
so priority according to priority
okay name me three
aww
inshallah
okay
no
so it's like practically
so
ya
mm
I think so I do not know maybe
no ah no
ya
ya why I look different
ya lah it has always been this ya but um
ya
but um
something that I need to tell you about this spectacle
no I didn't buy specs I buy something cheaper I buy super glue
so after that ya ya but eh I think is that one is reading glasses maybe
ya
eh it has this listing eh it will stick
orh
orh
orh
then then
hmm
eh that's the functional light right
you buy that all the way from
so the switch is there ah the one
ya
okay what nice what so when you sleep you will switch on that light
orh
ya ya ya I know
I know I sleep with you
huh
ah
huh
wait
orh yes yes yes
oh my god one
on a working day
then what time you woke up just now
then you should feel like
when you're surely
so you know they do it lah now
ya
ya
cause somehow when you're in that situation you know you have to do it you do it right
yes
orh
but because I think you got a lot of things already is it sometimes is the
orh
okay lah ya lah
but uni
ya
because that time I think uh
whether like um like
actually I don't think it's two I think it's three you know
ya
they do the editing and stuff is the third floor
ya
so ya lah
that's the thing
but I think I kind of know where's the new location at
ya I think there's a pool and there's a gym right
ya
so I think it's somewhere in the east side I think err central port
it's err geylang geylang
I think ah I think I may be wrong but I guess that's the location
ya maybe it's there or around the area
but I think it should be
east side
because he stays in the east
ya
east coast plan what east coast plan
ya
I think I think bedok area
eh

it's like it it is not those that if you look at it is very cringey
it it is those aesthetically pleasing
no that's quirky this is not nice
ya because they say is is too is too too
like too too much prints
like
uh
no I'm just asking asking you first like for your opinion like if it's okay
how
uh huh

why

no
no
okay you you you talk
you talk first it's not that you talk first
I felt rational for that
so you can say you can tell me your plans first
no no no no no no no no no no
faster
I mean ya lah that's fine lah that's not part of furnitures
I know I know
I know you tell your mum that our future house is gonna be a zoo
because your mum asked me about it
she said
it she asked me if it's true if I know that you are going to make our future house look like the zoo
and then I said yes I know
and then I gave her the straight face and then she was a bit surprise
then I told her
I'm in on it
and then I said ya you mentioned the whole making a pond just to put your turtles in it
and then I did tell her I I wanted to have some chickens but you told me that chickens are not legal
why
but why chickens are not legal
but I see some people have some people have chicken you know
no you can have cats in just as long as they don't they are not terrorizing our neighbours
ya
ah ya lah
so
okay
but why are people asking us to adopt chickens
but I think that one is really now illegal
I think that one is really now very much illegal compared to chicken
I I want a lovebird
but
you wanna be a turtle breeder
I don't think any but I I think not I think I don't think anybody wants to keep turtles for a long time
because they take up a lot of space
they really take up a lot of space
yes
yes can you give me awhile I want turn off the aircon
yes
because
I'm recording
ya I'm recording what
but it is very cold
I don't know I tell you I don't have the remote
but I think is the lowest
yes but I think it's the lowest
I mean like
ya I've never like changed the temperature
before so ya
eighteen
hmm
sometimes
must put air at home
yes
no
no
no
no
no
where
me see
I cannot see
no
oh oh oh oh oh I can see I can see
ya
what
correct
you are working today
huh
again
until what time
until
four fifteen
at where
do you earn a lot
how much
oh
not bad
not bad
ya
but but what
why you never do the that like like that time you do the afternoon
oh
oh
ya nevermind lah at least as long as like there's money coming in you know
so are you going to sleep after this
after this are you going to sleep
hmm
hmm
you know hanis never text me this week
ya I purposely never text her you know she also never text me eh
I'm not
what move
ya I think like if if she's going to text me then I'm going to
I'm going to tell her that
but she always gets away with it
don't want lah
too lazy to talk to her
hais
I I'm lazy to talk to her
ya
ya it's still the same you know how rina always use people to
I mean use status to make people stay
so apparently got one teacher she also wanted to leave but I heard from sonya that she made the teacher become a
senior teacher
I tell you soon everybody's going to be a senior teacher down there
ya anyway I'm going to tell you something you know hanisah
they have leadership this leadership program lah basically but like
um sofia and rina said that they are going to pay for her for the program you know
but it's bonded with the school and then I asked hanisah how long are you bonded with the school lah and then she says four years after graduation so she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three
now is twenty twenty right that she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three and then four years after that she's bonded
ya which is
wait wait how old are we now twenty five
thirty two so that mean at thirty two she can leave correct
ya so I ask her ah because they are because only because they are paying for it so I ask her lah the first thing I ask her is how much is the program that they are paying for you you know
and you know how much she tell me
four thousand
if it's only four thousand dollar the I also can pay I can give her the money now and pay you know
that's what you want to bond for that long you know like three years of study then four years of bond seven years more in you know seven years more in and they're only paying that course for four thousand dollars
so so you tell me
you tell me
no don't you think so
like who would who would bond for seven years in a school only to be
only to know that the course is only ah ya the cost is only four thousand dollars if the course is like eighteen thousand ah like twenty two thousand I can understand lah but this is only four thousand I thought the cost cost like twenty two thousand something but it's only twenty four thousand
no it's just a a a like advance is is advanced diploma in leadership program that's it
four thousand dollars I also two months of my salary I can pay already you know
then you want you want seven you want to what
stay seven years for that four thousand dollars which is so stupid right then I ask her to go and
and then she signed a contract already lah anyway and then then she tell ya and then she tell me about it like like at for she was a proud about the whole thing about the whole thing and then she was telling me and after I question her about four thousand dollars and then she was like quiet
I mean it's true what like why don't you think through you know you just anyhow sign and then she I I argued with her lah I said like maybe you should go back and they talk talk I mean the contract you can discuss again with sufian and rina what like maybe the four years can bring forward you know like inclusive of the time of study
you know what I mean
I mean even like my sunflower right the like I got this one teacher who that she's not going to educare lah she switch career and she was doing this she went to seek to study by sunflowers being for her but like it include the bond says that it includes her year of study you know they that makes sense what
besides that after you graduate then you complete your bond which is like four years after that
which like a total of seven years meaning it's a total of seven years like why you so dumb and at least my friend the one that is in sunflower her course total is twenty six thousand you know
this one is this one is four thousand eh
you you know that kind of logic
you you get what I'm saying
ya so I've been I don't know lah
I don't know at first she didn't tell me lah today after that then I ask I ask her again that I was having lunch with her then I ask her again about it and then she suddenly then she like casually to me it's four thousand I literally look at her like
why
just why are you hearing you yourself I don't know lah is it
ya and then I then she say she will talk about it after she say ah who knows rina she say this you know who knows rina have something planned for me like dude
even if rina has something planned for you rina is planless herself
she just give it to you just for the sake of the it is not because you really earn it you know what I mean
ya that's the whole thing you know like it's so different eh in and in sunflower like anybody can be a senior teacher there and like in sunflower you have to work like fifteen years that kind that look at miss saba
ya
no because of the boy you know that travis that the the one I told you about
and they never say anything all
I mean ya inform the parents ah but we don't want to show the footage
ya because like like we we as much as possible we never want to show the parents the lah what's going on
ya
ya but like what the hell it's like he was possessed you know
ya really I should have shown you yesterday
ya it's in my phone I have it my phone because I saw the incident happened and then I told jay directly I say you go and check the you know from one fifty five to two o'clock you see what's going on in that five minutes you know I told her then she really go and see lah and she send that the entire whatsapp then everybody like lah and then like my because my my is chinese teacher she's very fierce like apparently she she's the only one that he so scared of she made him cry you know
ya you know if I go to this boy and scold him he will just cover his ears and then like walk around
that kind
ya but my my with my he don't dare
ya so that's that that's travis
ya but like the therapist is coming in next week to because we showed the therapist that footage and then the therapist say she will come in next week to assess him and see how it goes
ya but the thing about this boy is he doesn't do that in front of other people so like when there's strangers he doesn't do this kind of aggressive shit you know
I mean I mean I like to say
bad stuff
I don't know ah
and okay okay ya

ya
really
I just can't reach
and like almost a lot of washing machines are that height
that top height like cause it's pretty average my house washing machine
so that's why I did this research and I've been wanting to tell you so that's why I said I tell you about it
so so you have to consider it

no it's in my cupboard
but I really have it in my thing it's no scratch nothing it's still very good condition
right I can get money why not can put inside my savings
since I touch my saving I touch my savings
what
what
what
say

uh ah
I think
work from home
so everything is at home so
that's why lah I decided to actually go out to eat
oh I didn't know it's only twenty minute
cause I would think that it's like two hours
muay thai
is not going to be there all the time kan
wow
orh
it's very tiring lah
this is during my secondary school time
I quit choir
to join badminton
and then I was in the girl's team
ya and then um
I join competition
but do you that um I only
I didn't actually fight with anyone like you know be in a match
and I already secured myself second place
ya exactly
err hmm apparently it's possible lah
whoa
that's a very
defined goal
in your life
stand
one other days in this one is like what everyday
like do this
everyday or like just certain days
no it's not two K it's very little actually I think it's because
the funny part is kan
when I search for jobs they actually want
people with experiences even though it's a
let's let's say it's a intern job
the intern job also they want experiences I mean like I don't know how am I supposed to find
a starting job to get all these experiences
in a good company
actually
what I look for in a job kan it's not just financial stability
but more of like
I want to be in a in a company that
err that actually appreciates you for what you do
nowadays
especially in start ups
they
just literally
if this
job or experience is worth it because you are doing bits and pieces of everything
that's why I like I'm finding a job that actually
values
like
their employees ah that's very hard for me to find
my god
can I say something
so kan
err I was hired
and I have
um like a
specialist diploma
err diploma girl
her job scope changed her from doing graphic design to digital marketing and you know what's worse
she is the head of my team you know when she is younger
and no experience and I've been in that company for six months
so I feel like shit you know like honestly because
like I have the qualities like honestly I'm doing really well like
teach the marketing
how to even do like a video thing you know like I cannot lah
and she's not hired for it but
she's getting paid more you know like I'm getting way lesser and she's
I don't know it's it's damn weird
she's twenty
ya
yes
that's true
let's let's not talk about this topic lah let's just uh move on because like I find
this type of uh topic kan like
it will never end
so what do you do now
like
what's your job scope
wait
so
you
telling me that
they don't really get
and then
like
while you're eating all these
how are they going to interact and then like
build on the social aspect
because I think the student care is there is to like
also like help them
not just academically lah
but more of like
mingling around with others
then if they can't do that then what will you do
this is going on
ya lah
so I guess they're trying to mould them into
being this type of
perfect person
but
because
ya like I said
how is
that gonna help them in a long run because
you will totally be affected by this and traumatised maybe
you know send me to student care
ya
you know
so
ah lah
my job scope
no lah just do bits and pieces of everything
ya lah
so
yesterday
wah
like she's having a lot of fun jer
very sweet lah I find
ya
actually
like
this christmas kan
anniversary
like literally on christmas
because ya he
he like
ask me out on christmas
like it's on a christmas
a bit a bit weird lah like
anniversary
orh
orh
we every month actually
celebrate the
like we literally go all out like we go eat expensive food
ya
huh
that is horrible actually
okay lah my boyfriend
okay okay jer lah
I think he's sweet
clingy
is the word for it
I think I'm the type
who
likes being clingy but I also have
to have the time alone
like to
to just get the energy back
I'm I'm
too used back then lah to be alone like being with friends
so when I was with him
when he was clingy I feel like
I'm being controlled
ya
ya that's true
I mean like
hopefully
ya
I agree with that everyone has their own timeline
so
like
how is
you and your family
actually
being the
eldest
you want to know why
they really like instill this list of
a list of responsibilities that I have to follow
then
like
they always me you have to lead
so like everything lah like academically wise
so that my brothers can
like follow the right path
ya and then my
brother's just came out
like
ya
and
like
ya it's it's
different lah like you can see
like as the years goes by my parents don't really care
about like
academic
like not as
how it used to be for me
wow
um you have to take
the scolding
like
just take it with a pinch of salt
like you are who you are so
ah
so sweet
uh huh
a sign lah actual
um
ya but then he ended up passing away
ya when I was young
so I think what you can do kan is
ah
mm
aduh
salad jer
the nutrition
nutrition site
is not there
then how are you going to make sure like the money that you spend on is worth
especially if you buy a lot at one go
ya
I think
it's a lot of work
like there's so many things you cannot juggle at one time
and for those who cannot multitask or or like
plan the days where a weeks well
confirm will have a hard time coping
I don't know anything about the twenty two curse
but then
I feel like
everything
it's not free lah
in the end
you have to work hard for it even if it's
small little things
even like let's say happiness within family
you have to work hard
to put in time effort even money
like sometimes I feel to have the happiness in family can have to work but then you work when you working how you gonna have time for family so really balance everything
sometime I feel
to have the happiness in family kan you have to work but then you work when you working how you gonna have time for family
so
really balance is everything
huh
bus stop
don't want to take responsible for him
that is
really cruel
but I think like
there must be some problems within the family
like rooted deep inside their family in order for this to happen
how you treat your parents is how you're teaching your your kids to treat you
I find that very
like
like when we grow old
like you know because my mum's
mother
so with my grandma on my mum side
I kind of
that we won't even know
so nowadays I've been trying to like
just some simple talks
and she's
she refuse to stay at home
like she's
she has
has she has been going out
like
literally like working studying all these kind of stuff
she's too used to walking out
so like
then she
because of corona then like
the
so she
like weekday she don't actually
but then she still go out
what the heck
like
your leg
actually I
seventy to eighty
around
eh I don't know how old
which ah
ya yes
ya she
like
you work your whole entire life
you know
and like not like
for her
I think um
then
scenery
you
you know what's funny
even
I find
like you know those bricks
I will take photos of those bricks
an err we like whoa
like I don't know I I think like
very simple
like
I don't even like
tea is not my thing
but then I I
keep thinking about it's like
oh ya the ferris wheel the houses
there's something that is
calling out to me
true lah
that's true
now that
economy
depends on them also
and I think
birth rate
we cannot do anything about it lah
I mean
I have seen
would this be something I would want
in the future
they look like
they're struggling
like
you look at these families
and then you like
they they really like
like
are they doing well
like
especially when you see them
in public
you wonder about their well being
is it weird that I think that way
but I think
you can see like they're
they're okay
like the kids are like happy and everything I think a a big happy family is
something
I would want in the future honestly
rely on
maid
I I think like
in the future right okay
the thing that is driving me to work hard kan
is that
I don't have in the future if I don't work work well
I can just get a maid
is that weird
like
so I've been living with a maid
so like if
I have that taken away from me
I don't know how to cook I don't how to clean
so if I have kids in the future
hopefully I can get into a university
I have been
financially
ya
ya
hopefully ah like
ya
actually I have
find all these like
but I do have a
plan in mind
maybe that's why I
you know took a break
I
I took like a one year break
before I start
working
you have to know
so
good thing that actually found something that I want to try out
in that area
ya
I also
that one year right
university
and then
I here waiting one more year to start on my degree
is that weird
that one year gap
like
put in effort to really go all out kan
I would have been so much happier
I do feel depressed when I think of it
and it makes me sad
I didn't know you took a one year break also
ya I thought you were studying or working
november jer pe you know
I
like literally
no
I bet you didn't know that
ya
my savings I used to have savings
yes
that's true
that's what I've been looking at
like to get my experiences and maybe use that as one of the factors to why they should
accept me to the university lah
wow
thank you
ya
that's the thing I don't know how to look at their courses
like I know what I want to do but I don't know like you know this
honours thing and then what minor
I hoping to get marketing
ya
ya lah
like
seriously
just because we have many experiences with different companies
like
okay like it also depends on the company they how they think
you have a lot of experiences
in that sense
you can help the company
the future company
in all these
areas
like maybe to improve you know
better
you know like I don't know like turn over rate
like lesser or something you know like
it's hard lah
to to know how does the hiring works
they are not okay with
is
categorised under job hoppers
so how are you supposed to be like a
graduate
with already experiences
like let's say they are looking for
did you see this advertisement job advertisement
they say they want someone in the twenties
but with like ten years of experience
ya that it was like going around in on the internet for awhile like
you expect to be like
ten plus like in your teens
and already start working or something
I have no idea
that's one of my wish
that's one of my wish lah in life like
I just want to have a job
that I'm happy to wake up to
I think
it's really hard to find
it's also depends on your mentality
how you have
like what's your outlook of life
which
is hard to change honestly
illegal
illegal movies I don't know lah no lah it's not illegal it's more of like they uploaded on internet let let's say I come upon to it you know
and then I'll be interested in it and then
you know I've I've watch all the
conjuring series
ya
no I don't
stranger things
it's good
like okay like in in my
in my
it's it's
they're kids
so they're cute
like
like what they do is like something we can
relate to
I think everything is nicer with someone else
it's okay you'll
god has
plans for you
confirm
I can see
I can foresee you being happy in the future lah
so
okay back
to stranger things
but
what
caught me caught my attention until like
at first okay I think they will start because of the hype
then you get the fun out of it because
you kind of have this friendship with them so like it's more of like
quit the game because
you have friends
to be there for you already
so like if you cut
the game out your life kan
you're cutting
ya
I
on my four
overcome
I
the younger one
youngest
invest
in a game
like like literally okay let's
you don't have to buy a four you can buy a switch
I think that's
the easier way that you save money
eventually if you were to play play nation all the time
the invest on
rely on dividends
actually I not so sure
okay lah

okay testing
okay lah can lah
so I think one of the
requirements is that you cannot speak
to the extent of um hitting the red waves
yeah
ah but it has to be that means twenty apart from each other
no no as in your phone has to be with you my phone has to be with me ya that's one of the requirements ah
take this as a the centre marking ah
so how was your prep
an obvious day I I kept stalling or like ah um what about midway but I kept falling at a plaza on you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or I keep releasing too fast or something like that lah so the bottom when moving then the stall those told you do
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
but what what was the instructor's comments
mm
the same instructor
I think they they they want more money ah
it's the same bike
mm
E brake eh
oh okay okay ya ha ya it's there ah okay wait it was on the straight road
ya there's one mirror there
ya
mm
behind ah
oh okay
secluded ah
okay
um
of course lah
wait you went you you stop to help her
oh the instructor went to help her
ya lah I mean he has to help him help her
just ya
oh she
ya correct ya
mm
mm
what so she crashed into the wall
skid ah
by point of time you stop ah
mm
mmhmm
kill switch
mm mm mm mm mm
oh you get you got number one ah
mm
bandana
mm
mm
the other side ah
then
mm mm
mm mm
but he was in charge of your class ah
prac one also lah
oh okay
hmm
no lah maybe maybe they they want you to practise more ah before even going for prac two because I think prac two is
slope
plank
plank easy I mean no lah some some beginners will have quite a hard time to balance
class two ten seconds
okay lah I mean with practice you can ah
you technically don't need to even throttle because half clutch
no you need to brake also because class two B half clutch ya can go up to fifteen already ha
that's how fast a class two bike is ah
which is why I can't wait to get to get my harly ah
highly harly can bobber ah you know those bobbers bike mutt is expensive lah sia uh I I I tested the bike um
I think last year during uh
so when they they they open up their their booth
people lah so I tried the the two fifty version
so that is two B version one two five
there's a two five zero
you gonna end up the same as riding a
two hundred bike
whatever what you see is what you get lah
I don't know is it
I I'm not sure what that retailers that brings but
uh sanju
kaki bukit sanfu sanfu
uh and I think the
for a two B bike you know much the is the cost price
seven ah seventeen K
eh sorry sorry two B is fifteen K two A is seventeen K
four K
four plus ah
expensive ah
definitely way cheaper lah I mean it's a if it's a continental bike but it comes from china so
no no no I mean uh zontes
if you look at mutt it's almost the same as my bike ah brixton
but of course lah mutt is mutt is
I mean way better lah
eh um if I trade in my brixton for your mutt
can we make an arrangement
oh I'm sorry because we are just we are just dealing but
uh brixton is is is a europe bike ah
if if you really want a mutt then I think it's best if you can try to sell it out ya
um
you should upgrade to two A first
then you you take your class two
not used to the the no not only heavy the high power
but waste money ah
you upgrade
mm
ah lah of course lah of course lah
no lah I mean I'm looking at my options
why ah
ya but super four is uh quite reliable bike ah
it is
ya no problem
they bring down the the of the bike
put a
mm
but the one thing about super four
it's freaking expensive ah sial
my my bike one bottle that means one litre lah so doings
no no no as in the engine oil every two thousand click to three thousand click
no lah one month ah I mean right now COVID one month ah
back then eh no lah back then when I was working in uh
when I was working in office
I travelled about sixty click everyday
that it took me about one month ah to to to reach two click two thousand click
going back to super four
you know how many bottles of engine oil they need ah
four
four bottles of engine oil four spark plug
four
I mean some some bikes have like we just okay lah harly's have okay harly even harly
would only require three bottles
and maybe two spark plug
four bottles of okay lah let's say if you use the most basic engine oil but if you're riding a Super Four I'm pretty sure you want maintain you probably get the medium
motul uh ten fifty or ten forty that is about twenty four dollars twenty five dollars so that's times four that's about a hundred bucks already
and then spark plug if you get
the good spark plugs ah
normal spark plugs is about twelve dollars
so twelve times four
that's why lah I mean one of the reasons why didn't want to get a super four
like what
is it
it's nice lah I mean it looks bigger than the
ya
capacity
mm
oh
ya lah and I mean if you think about it a zontes is way cheaper ah
no the furthest I went with this bike was um desaru
the furthest I went with my was uh muar
ya ya lah
um
tow ah
they will go for the
the dangerous way ah
this one I I never tried ah I tried I fail I don't know how it works so imagine you were in front of me imagine your bike died
so I'm the one who is pushing you ah
so you've lift down your foot rest
my left leg
uh power to push together
ah
eh
they went up
I don't know but a few delivery riders ah
so this guy what was a cyclist
he passed his two B
so when you are you are running I mean it it it's the same for new bikes so when you're running in your your new bike or uh a new overhauled engine
um
you're not supposed to exceed a certain and certain speed
your speed has to be less than ninety like I mean that's what I did for my bike lah
so this guy
I think chances of you surviving is
very little
jammed brake
you're just depending on your depending on your brake
bike off
just put it to neutral lah
speaking of bike accidents
uh my father's friend ah
dulu bapak aku pun kira mat mat motor juga ah
eagle is it
and then I think he was riding an
so this the rider
my father witnessed his friend died lah sia
so so
before this guy died ah he told me lah then he was very different
eh you know forgive me ah if I ever sinned towards you ah
so on that day they went to
but same case ah he went under the truck
it's dangerous ah
oh speaking of dangerous riding kan I think one of their simulation lessons kan
they will simulate
you drunk
but it's damn stupid ah sial
no pass no fail
is just car just swerve in front of you
cannot
you turn using your handlebar
handlebar
you can ah but then it's stupid ah
it's just stupid
your leg on your bike ah
everything it's like a normal back
it's like a real bike
it's a fonex
I think when when when it comes to your simulation lesson I think
can
but you will hold the bike ah no need no need no need
you driving in india is it
huh
he mounted the kerb in the mini circuit where is the kerb sia
that is far sia
mm
ya ya
huh
huh serious ah
oh the bike was lying on top
where were you
at the starting ah
he went home ah
it means quite quite bad lah
old guy ah
but big size ah
hazriq size ah
it but your class good
they they they there's this one small bike ah
I see that bike ah
alamak
what the guy is small or big
why sia why would he buy such a bike
no lah I mean if you scared I mean don't ride ah
maybe ah
but if you talk about those small bike ah
those those similar those kind of bikes ah
um there's this bike it's called uh honda monkey
but that bike is I I've seen this guy he he modelled his bike ah he'd turn that back into a chopper bike
like legit I had to bend down
because cafe racer is a racer is a racing bike
I mean for the olden days lah which is why it's it's called a cafe racer
so
I don't know ah
mm
go back to office ah
so you're gonna take you bikes ah
stupid eh
huh
you can book everyday
legit ah
oh
if got two days later
mm
mm
then you exceeded the line ah
oh exceeded the line means fail because if you are too fast also if you you stop in time they shouldn't be an issue ah
that was your last ah
assessment
fail ah
mm
mm mm
oh
mm
if there is a car you need to stop ah
ah
serious
mm
mm
bike instructor
ah serious ah
what if you hit into a car
who is the huh then the the damage all cover is it
mm
ya
no no no you have to okay so back then when I took a private kan the one I failed
so you will
as a start you will drive on the road
so it's
two point
and the two points is unlimited or I thought there's a limitation kan

bring a bottle I have a lot of your bottles at home sia I think I have four five bottles at home

oh confirm lye can ah
I tell you confirm can ah
should be able able to ah
they they they should be able to do what they should be able to do right
I know rin joo I think they are they are not keen to have us already ah ever since
but then rin joo already stated that they are not going to quote for the job right
in the email if I remember it correctly yes they say like that ah
back to covalent eh
ya I I'm a fan of blackpink
but some say ah that they are using plastic surgery
yes
yes
risky lah
I don't know you can try ah
can see
but back to covalent how are you going to ah
ah
is it the meter or what
victoria is aware about this lah
ah yes correct
but has everything been assigned or not
okay but within the flat the the facade what because they going to pour right
the ya the cement
wait so so
platform ah
ah okay okay

okay
correct
ya
dah confirm ah
highland out already ah

mm
oh the ladder the loose ladder ah

oh
so after that you go grade yourself and then ah
and then when you grade when you grade for higher higher grading eh
this is what I heard from ah from harries ah he told me that if you grade yourself high ah then management will think that you have no room for improvement so ah management will actually move down to lower lower
chey

mmhmm
what do you mean by not progressing
actually um
so like I want to make use of it
even though um the
the idea that no longer having money is kind of like scaring me a bit ah cause like
I don't know eh
mm
cause like honestly nowadays
started business
like microbusiness right solely because of
sometimes in your head you think you can do better
or like you can come up with something better cause nowadays
not saying that I have a lot of skills or what but then like ya it's just
something I sort of feel like ya
I saw
err
so like it's I feel like she shouldn't price it so high cause I have a feeling that's the same probably the same process
um
when I saw the TikTok I think it's
in a way it is err embroidery in a machine but then like I think maybe
she just has to like either type out the name or like design it a bit ya
actually I think there's a okay maybe there is a bit of difference
like
I think we both follow the same
I think we do lah we do follow the same account so whatever accounts we follow is
is is unique in their own way I like maybe like
ah necklaces or like earrings
oh ya ya ya
ya ya oh my god ya
mm
and by right I think actually if you cannot also you can actually
can glue right
but it's just it won't last long
is either they have to give up their style or they have to um
not give up but maybe like either alter themselves or like
ya
actually ya now that you mention it I I actually don't know how like how did
the like entire universe decide
that oh this would be this makes an S this makes an M this makes and L this makes and like
how because like I can
nots I mean I'm not really I would probably say that I am considered average
eh average lah ya and then like
don't have M L I don't know if they have M L but ya it's like that
mm mm so like I'm like
like what if like you on the
cause like it's not that it's not that thin like not really that hugging but then it's not exactly
I don't understand
orh
your bust
speaking of like
what's that call uh sustainable is it call sustainable fashion
ya sustainable fashion and thrifting and all that honestly
um I think people confuse that and thrift that and vintage a lot
and I really feel like people should educate themselves because
there's a difference and
I don't know how to I don't even know how to explain the difference cause like
but like you know how um
and not not to name any but Loop Garms and um
cause that time um actually
my boyfriend actually ask uh ask me uh send me this post by Loop Garms
ah chris chris jericho ya chris jericho the shirt
then ah he like he like it ah cause he really like ah
like he was saying like he likes it ah then like he's
he's too shy to ask so even though he he is like to be honest when I
but but I mean like I guess
some people might take that as
I don't know if they considered if people do consider Loop Garms or stuff like that
or whatever shop similar to that um as thrifting
is just like another man's
trash that you consider to be treasure you know what I mean right correct right ya
people see it as an investment
I mean there's still a lot of fans it's just that maybe like
I don't know like only certain people will still be able to see the value in it like
cause there will there will always be like this
ya but also like there'll always be this resurrection of
of people who suddenly fall in love with vintage and like
really want to like spot
so ya
ah
the whole oh okay
so cute
honestly I think
like you know you your comment about the fashion in in general the fashion industry I think
I think people I mean obviously we're trying
more lah like this I think
this generation is more aware and like willing to like
make certain changes but honestly it's been like years of
is
is been years of like um
it just it just happen we suddenly like care about it I guess or like we're less ignorant
like more aware of what we're using and what we're wearing and like whatever we're consuming also now we're more
um
I don't know we're just more conscious yes that's the word conscious
honestly it's ironic that
that the thing that was meant to um reduce um
I mean honestly I don't even understand how
that uh I mean I understand how it happened but also don't understand cause like obviously at the root
it's just that like other humans and like us like just
that and just I think we are just wasteful people
entitled I guess a part of it is entitled and also
ya era era ya so
um I think we just
too
everything is too convenient now
like we don't really see the value in that in that thing we don't really see like
uh how much was like
put into like making it
and stuff like that
honestly uh
what we talking about
okay I don't know how we got to this I think cause we started talking about sustainable fashion ya
but ya I think you know how you ask me like
I think maybe
for now you just try to
um I think that one once you done I guess you can
cause you sold it to her at a reasonable price uh honestly
I I also don't I mean is it she make her own tote bag or what like no no no I meant the tote bag itself you know the
she made herself
oh
okay but but I think mm
pricey lah in my opinion is not that pricey cause you set how much you want to pay
no as in I meant the promotion you know how you told me about that advertisement and all that ya all those ads
you set how long it was so like you can actually just have it for one day for like seven days
or like one month also can then you can also choose how much you want to
how much you want to pay
how much you want to pay per day so it can be like
five dollars six dollars seven dollars per day also can actually
ah cause
you can choose you you like I said you can choose how much do you want to pay per day also right then you can also like
choose who you aiming for cause you can choose like
uh
if I'm not wrong you can choose like based on interest so you can choose like crochet shopping and
bags fashion whatever lah like you can you can put that
under the interest so that you will so that the ads are targeted to the correct person
ah by right I think that it can
I think your posts can end up on there
overseas
ya
oh ya ya ya
you know the account gosh girl
ya I love
upcycle
orh
should we order together
lah
ya I know
but actually I kind of like those type of stores I kind of want to do something like that
honestly I think for honestly now that I think about it right if uh if I were
you or if like I have the
resources and I have the energy and the
motivation to do it myself I might actually
will you be interested then you see lah how many people would and all that like if it's a really popular design you should
probably consider bringing it back or something like that
ya cause like I think that's
that should be the goal of any
shop I guess cause like
cannot come up with anything new
a few back up or like a few
a few designs that you really
like know you can do it and then like it's not that complicated but it's still nice or stuff like that
so I don't know ah
honestly right ya
yes I can see that
actually I think
I mean honestly it's smart lah and also and also
you post about it like once on her story
you know what I mean and that's still a lot what
anyway the designs also so cute seh
will it last if there's no lining
actually I love uh that some some
so I think it's cute but ya
ya
I mean we're not encouraged to follow it even
honestly um
err
I really think I love the baggy look a lot then like I don't know ah I just want to do something creative not that I've the free time
but everytime I have free time
I don't understand why like I already have free time what I don't know why I'm not using it you know then like
I'm actually still thinking about it
but ya so like I actually kind of
to me it's not really that complicated
you know accounting actually I think
realise it's an important skill
because even though account accounting is kind of a
just a bit boring to me but then um
because um
okay uh
okay so I I took when I was in like secondary ya it was in secondary I didn't do well lah honestly but
but I still understand what it is lah
financial statement or whatever okay no ah
like
took my score because it was a bit low ya but but honestly
is not
it's not dreadful but then
it's honestly just very is desk job lah but you
ya
ya mm
um industries that will be fine in a
in this situation is banking accounting food
food obviously lah cause
maybe
ah yes education and then
ah ya delivery like
ya lah just logistics maybe and stuff like that like
but arts will always be affected
ya
is it wild rice or is it singapore repertory theatre
they have ah I think they holding a performance I don't know
really
I got the email for it mm
I was like do I why did I subscribe to
mm
hotel orh it's a production
is it popular or what
boring
boring jer
like I can't make you a man or whatever what's that line ah
something you are not ah okay yes
I think it is because like because
yes
it instead of it being like a
oh I'm really going to
put in like minorities in my show cause they deserve to be the main character
versus like oh I'm just going to cast this
like just to be there so that people don't say it's completely white or just completely
certain race or whatever I don't know
ah ya ya ya ya
jameela
ah yes yes yes
tahani
yes
ya
ya
I know you trying to think of for a show where
I don't know ah like
yes because
but I have a feeling that some people
mm
mia khalifa
but
everyone in the world knows her and has obviously seen parts of her that I'll I feel like she would rather not
and she was also forced to do it also you know what I mean that's why I honestly sympathise with her on that lah
ya
it's not a lot lah actually but
I don't know ah
but
I mean ya lah
not all I will just say right now I just going to say right now even if I said all I don't mean all lah okay
but like not all but some
how do you think like that like how do you let yourself think like that cause I can look at a guy
and like I won't think like that you know what I mean
I I mean
I mean like I guess I get okay I understand
not trying to be like
fight back you know what I mean
like we are have always been perceived as
ah yes like weaker we like not the stronger um
species eh species gender sorry ya
like misogyny ya
okay
oh okay
mm yes
mm
ya
yes
arranged marriage
they don't have a lot of shows also
mm
ya

no serious okay maybe I'm not as bad as some people
you know her kan ya you know her she tried cooking
no and then you know her mum was like hospitalised for a week
serious
because
kita sebagai orang islam kan kita semua terrorist tu semua you know
ya even though I hate doing laundry so heavy but ya and then like uh you know in malaysia the the women's army actually wears hijab
ya
which I don't want to do lah I mean I don't know about you but just walking ten minutes in hijab is enough to make me sweat and imagine having to exercise in hijab wah I did that in year one because okay in my school we have this um thing where all year ones have to do sports it's called sports for life
so err I was in what was it called squash oh my god I love squash it's like tennis but you just hit the ball against the wall and you can actually go blind for it ya but then the thing is kan um
I I was wearing I was already wearing a hijab lah in year one and then dude the warm up exercise consist of us running around doing push-ups squats and all that
I felt like dying it was so hot cause like not only was I wearing a hijab so not only was my head and my neck covered up but I also had to wear the sleeve and then so inside I was wearing a long sleeve shirt and then outside I was wearing the sports for life uniform and then I was wearing socks and all that wah dude it was like
it wah I felt like I was dying in the desert sia serious
that was how hot it was and there was only two fans in the court and then I wasn't even there was so many of us so I wasn't even anywhere near the fan I don't even know how I survived that I should have just joined yoga or something
no lah cause actually the reason why I joined sports kan was cause uh it was super cool to me like can you imagine playing tennis or whatever against the wall you don't have to worry about looking at other people in the eyes but then uh I found out that usually squash like in pairs kan
you have to be careful cause you can actually hit your partner with the racket and then like um you have to wear the face face gear or something cause sometimes um the ball will hit against you like when it bounce against the wall kan
then like uh then my my coach was like scaring us about how this player he didn't pay attention to where the ball was going then it hit him in the eye then he turned blind then I was like shit why did I even join this no that and
one of my crush was actually in squash
ya so so like when I found out that he was in squash I was like oh my god we can play squash together so I joined lah but then we ended up being in different groups
so
and now he's with an older lady
so
kan kan I mean I don't remember but I think his new girlfriend is quite hot I guess so I guess I can see why he wanted to be with her but still like dude ugh
oh my god you know speaking of men I have one month like by the end of this month to find a guy
because
you remember diana
he is I think he's four to five years older than us he is working at this um company so um usually he'll be at tuas checkpoint cause uh his company is collaborating with the checkpoint for this new facial scanner
thing
ya so but but her boyfriend is a bit her boyfriend is like you know ahmad remember ahmad

on that very friday and it wasn't even that he started early tau he started at like eleven plus and then he was supposed to submit by err four o'clock or was it five o'clock and you know when he promised to meet her
no two o'clock
so she's she was waiting for him no wait he was supposed to meet her at twelve o'clock but then she was waiting for him from twelve until two
kan like okay
I respect everyone's beliefs
I have friends who are atheist I have friends who are non-believers I have friends who are buddhist my family has christians and taoist and all that like my family is a mash of like different religions
oh ya

oh my god what should I do do you have any suggestion I need to find a guy I need I need someone to help me
oh should I just pretend to be a lesbian but no that's not believable
I tried that once actually people actually believed it
ya
but that's cause they don't really know me that well
actually you know um in poly kan back in poly I was asked out a couple of times by girls
ya apparently I give off a lesbian vibe
and then there was this girl who was
so into me she actually stalked me home serious serious I was so scared so everytime I want to go home my friends have to send me home cause she she would like take picture then she was like[eh oh my god we are in the train and and and I don't even know where she live at but I know it's nowhere near me
and you know what's the worst part
kan
and you know what's the weirdest part
eh hi we are on the same train again this morning like
bruh where did you even come from
ya I told her like oh um um I mean indirectly lah cause she was my quite close friends
ya
chi hao
but she never really got the hint
so until that project ah that project was when she got angry with me cause um I told her cause during the entire period she didn't do anything
ya
and then I was like oh okay we weren't even friends like she was in my course but she was from a different class
ya so I was like oh
okay girl I have seen but never talk to before and then oh my god there was another girl actually um so there's this there's this module called gen ed general education do you have it
and then kan we were roommates so like um okay this is going to get a bit explicit
mm
dude you know first day kan she just started stripping in front of me then she said oh I'm going to shower you can you can you can watch if you want
then I was like
so she met this uni guy over there and he look like her boyfriend
so she spend most of the time with him in his room
ya so um
ya at first
and then she said
end game
was he cute though
okay never mind
okay ah
oh my god I really want to see how he looks like
oh my gosh you know kan speaking of guys do you remember ateeb
he's still texting me now
ya okay
so the story of ateeb is a long one started back in sec one so in sec one um he confessed to me cause we were in the same clique
ateeb me jonathan zi qing and justin
there was this K-pop song that uses one four three means ya ya
ya so I wasn't interested in ateeb at all so err I told him like oh sorry man like you are a great friend and all but I don't think I can see you as anything more than a friend and then he he started spamming me so I just muted him like I felt bad for blocking him and we were in the same class and same clique
he spam
zi qing cause at that time zi qing was my best friend
cause like
ya he was spamming everyone and then uh afterwards I okay don't tell anyone okay
but I actually
had a crush on justin
no no serious I and and I don't know lah was I so excited when whenever I text him lah
and then he even asked me out but then apparently he like zi qing
so um at that time I had a crush on a senior then the senior made fun of me then I um tala found out you know you remember tala
ya so tala uh tala heard about it then tala was like eh D how can you go and confess to someone else when you are dating ateeb
and then but but apparently a lot of people really believe that I was dating ateeb dude that was the reason why none of my crushes accepted me because they thought I was dating ateeb and I was like two-timing
he um he saw me with my one of my friend her name is phyllis then he said eh phyllis damn cute sia can you intro me to her then I was like um I don't mind lah but as long as she accepts you then then and only then will I intro you to her
so err I ask
him to give me a his best picture then
ya so he sent me a picture uh if I can find the picture I'll send it to you then I showed it to her I showed it to all my friends like asking like eh if anyone's interested in this guy he's super rich
he's he's super rich yeah that's the only good part about him
ya and then after that mm err phyllis was like everyone actually they said that oh he looks quite cute from afar until they zoomed into his picture and his face then they're like
oh actually on second thought maybe not it was harsh but it was true I mean like would you date ateeb
you know what happened he found her account on tinder like she wasn't using it at that time lah cause she was dating someone else but then um afterwards
she she saw him and was like eh I know this guy so she just cause like she remembered him as my friend so she just match with him ah
then he started spamming her asking her to date him begging her to date him then she was like no no no no and she keep on saying no then after that she she got annoyed lah so she blocked him on tinder you know what did he did
no he went to my friends list he found her account he added her he her and then she she thought that at that time um phyllis and I were in the same clique so she thought that I was the one who gave him her account
then because of that right she got angry with me wah he he ruined a lot of potential for me man then after that he he spam her her her ah begging her to date him and all that then she block him also then afterwards um we weren't friends anymore like phyllis and me cause of him lah
and then he and then we just stopped talking and then in year two he texted me again like um it was a snapchat then I was like you know snap streaks were like super popular right then so I was like okay ah never mind it's just for snap streaks only what so I was like streaking with him
then like what makes you think that any girl would want you you know he he confessed to huda also
ya but huda rejected him also
dude I know I'm desperate but I'm not that desperate as to like know accept your money and then like date you you are not even sugar daddy material man
he was the one who led himself on
so in
kan maritime is like one end
no I I saw because they have a uniform pe
so I saw the uniform from afar then I I I was so scared cause like for a few days kan I keep on seeing like students from his school all of a sudden keep on coming to my school so I thought it was him then then err everytime I want to go anyway my friends will accompany me
ya and then he was in america like the ship was going around pe then his last stop was at america so he had to get back to singapore himself
then at that time it was already like period like cause we end on february fourteen then it was already like
anyone ya anyone who came back
had to be quarantined pe so he was quarantined at a hotel
I already told you all my friends don't even like you you are not even their type no no matter how rich you are your personality and your looks aren't worth it bro
uh ya but I I didn't lah cause it was so funny to see what he was texting
he found my email
dude I don't even know how he found my email

I thought I thought like seven years ago the emails would have been deleted already
so I just ignore then he emailed me like
he emailed me like on tuesday
I haven't open the email actually oh my gosh but ya
kan and then like um so I only told diana about this cause I never really get in touch with anyone else
I don't know man I mean oh my gosh I don't want to choose between ateeb or rudy that's so weird no no no no no oh my god I need a guy I need someone to pretend to be my boyfriend but all my friends are busy
he's always been like that actually
ya but then during secondary school kan after I rejected him again he you remember crystal
ya so err what went on was that err ateeb ateeb confessed to her a lot of times then she always said yes yes yes but but everyone knew that she was only saying yes cause she was playing around with him
she didn't even like him
I had a crush on justin at that time also
then like couple kan
ya and then like with rayson I always talk anime with him oh my god I missed it and then at that at that time kan I really thought that I had a chance with justin tau then I found out he moved on from zi zi qing to zi ning
and then he was super into zi ning at that time then I was like oh so all this time you treated me like a girlfriend cause she wasn't there and ya so I'm just a rebound again

oh oh you have to give a number or like describe it in a way says that
like like we we can estimate like oh okay okay this much ah oh okay
spoiler reboot

hundred million because it's like a wish right ah ya ya maybe a hundred million won't dry up ya or maybe maybe um
like ya but asking for a billion maybe oh ah for generations
okay so so you you so you you you don't intend to use it like a wish but you intend on
ah to to to to receive like a sponsorship
okay okay fine fine it if that is your wish I mean as a genie I will gladly give it to you ah since you are not that greedy
your wish is granted okay K K

my wish is
K lah I really want money ah so I don't have to stress about working or whatever shit

an everlasting life to what err I wish to live a long life to eat food and not gain weight right
ya and you see so you can enjoy it
see you next time so you you got a wish uh guidance err person here so anything before you make a wish I think you can come to me

mm go back to the future what I wanna do ah
wah this one very deep seh question
mm
err can we like pass can we do a easier non deep question you know ah this one I really need to think sia need to recall need to dwell on the past
ya too much feels
um currently now I am err working

uh huh
ah
hair tie and bag okay what on platforms like carousell
oh seller like those home based businesses
not like those mini one lah non non uh ACRA registered ah
ACRA ACRA
ya so if you own a business you need to start thinking about ACRA so ACRA is err let me tell you what it stands for ah it's accounting and corporate regulatory authority
ya so in it's a ministry whereby you need to you know all those income tax et cetera that kind I mean that is IRAS so this is ACRA ACRA is for business registration kind all those companies lah basically companies
ya but still err that's why they say unregistered home based businesses ah ha
ya and but are still unregistered you see so that kind lah so um ya I don't know this is like this grey those grey area kind apparently my start up is ACRA registered lah
ya
mmhmm mmhmm
I mean it's good lah so how is it doing so far
ah okay
okay so but so err haven't sell much at or haven't sell at all or

so you just gonna do this
so sending out resumes already lah

walao still very young lah
what the hell twenty seven already ya
yup
ya but I'm stuck at uh twenty four
uh I mean like
I I
no I I'm really stuck at twenty four just that the facial hair growing at the age of twenty
no no I I I feel like err
no you you will you will understand once you age like like you feel like your age is fixed at a certain that one but the number just keeps increasing
nope you you you will you will you will soon
I am the last one
ya
oh you're the youngest also
okay and you're the youngest alright
yes because your wish is part of a superpower I actually want to ask like superpower itself because I wanna ask you so that because you have to ask me back lah ya so what superpowers do you want
uh apparently you already got that wish granted so now you're invisible
you already got you already got the power of dracula also and and uh okay uh the the the the food giving one eliminated
no you want to hear something new
ah
a teleportation
okay lah so just teleportation hmm okay good
in this era it would be
err
I mean assuming my wishes are granted then
err
wah ya like if I really were to think about something like in depth quite hard lah cause I I I want like I I want mind reading even though I can read people's err err
even though I can read people no even though I can read people I mean you might not know whether it's hundred percent true maybe it's just eighty percent
correctness but you want it to be like hundred percent right so mm mind reading maybe maybe not
err printing money apparently I already say if I don't have my wish granted yup I want that um teleportation sounds good also
mm but is it for one person or two person I don't know
your teleportation can teleport you only or like like you can hold people and like boom tele
ya ya ya
the err what do you call that night crawler ah
but night crawler need to imagine the place then you can go if you
uh so nightcrawlers one is limited ah err
woo seh
uh oh now ah um ah then suddenly
ah the red light district of singapore
oh now don't know I thought you say all okay imagine can just teleport only
ah oh I see oh now now you take back
yup I mean
whatever lah let's say my money dry up I just print some more lah
no lah not copy and paste ah just my hand like you know a deck of cards of money come out like that okay yup
the money is come out like that
can lah anytime you no need to get a genie lah my my superpower can lah give you some
today my treat
yup very convenient and easy
okay come next one I think I asked the second question already right superpower
so yup so that's my question so how about yours what you want to ask
no I I ask what I ask you superpower I ask err wish
you ask me what err what I do that one and
the I forgot what's the other one
I also I also short term memory
ah
ya it's the smallest err smallest more specialised err what you call that
I I don't know if I I don't know but it's very specialized all I can say it's so specialized and there's only a handful of people doing it lah it's such a small community
um but the best part is ya I'm not I am not practising it lah
I don't want to practise it yup
I'm not practising as in you see now I'm doing so or being instead of doing radiation therapy
ya
so I mean because it's too mechanical like um I deal more with uh like all the machine machine instead of people
feel like I'm the I'm the cure for them
instead
here we're going to start the treatment then move here move there perform blah blah blah blah then it's just like that then okay bye take care remember just like that
in a in a way err the field lah I want to be is actually like err psychology kind become a psychiatrist ya but I heard
you will have to go err what you call that err undergo
undergo clinical hours yourself that means you have to go your own counselling sessions that means you have to be counselled for three hundred hours
something like that lah and ya you're not only you have to study but you have to clock in this clinical hours and you have to pay for them yourself
ya you have to pay so yes three
yes correct so three hundred of the hours you have to not only pay the school fees you have to come up with your own money to pay counsellors before you work as one
uh huh so that's what deterred me from what I wanna do lah unless I can print money right then I mean like
that's that's wasted on it let's just study
yup exactly money's a big freaking issue
err ya talking about it like very depressing already
like money lah like I I don't know now at this age I mean I feel like money never enough already sadly

mean you used to be in you know this lah pasal you know they don't you know ask them to open with up to the other retail banks kan so
ah even for your maid you know today anyway lah eh these days
ah
but generally lah my preference honestly is to go to a place where no one knows me and then I can just lose myself
okay we go italy one day milan two day rome one day
that that's more it lah you know
err not not easy lah to go in kan that so really really under developed but the people were slowly getting used to
see the developments but the changes kan since my time there and it's been what you know uh more than twenty years kan almost what twenty five years maybe the changes are immense so even I don't recognize it anymore
ah ah okay good we are one hour already
ah we can stop recording
okay let's stop recording stop now

eh how was your job interview
five year plan on what what did you say
I would feel the same
I think if I were to think back about my previous recent job interview you ask me so what's your aspiration
but I think that's not a good good enough answer how would yes I think that last sentence could be
but then you were saying that for the interview you had a follow up
from the same company or different
but I think the company has been around for how long
they are much more stable like not so err intimidating
you never know what happen in the future also random questions that you might ask
yes I think for now this time you cannot be choosy with the job offers
but different job different exactly but also it's using pandemic what two people ah and that there's all this companies wing cost saving also what right so I think you choose your job
which is good
mm yes
someone depend on you also right
why not
mm
yes
wah that's that's okay too kan
what
five year plan what's your five year plan to get a house for you to move into my new house well I mean of course lah once you are married you also want to have your own property too
yes that's another point yes
of course we can make it work lah for the brand but just that now during COVID times we are just thankful that we are getting by and people still buy our latest item even though um
okay lah I think because of the price point is quite okay like for the printed t-shirt is about thirty nine people are willing to spend that much but if the price is like above fifty you know I don't think people would want to spend that money because every every dollar counts
yes
tourist
but what if that four hundred six hundred dollars is equivalent to like fifty dollars worth to them
yes precisely
of his family probably
three thousand can last me for few months of expenses
you will regret spending three thousand in one day I tell you something one night I was sleeping right then I was thinking wah I hate to count my calories cause I'm on a diet I need to be on calorie deficit so there's this fitness eating err calorie counting app lah I used it before but if you want some like extra features you have to pay for it lah okay
no no I it's paid for
but it's for one year
I bought that app when I was half asleep I mean if I were to cancel it now
I cannot remember I don't think
I will check it out
refund
really even though it's not even though is like a few weeks
I know right next time I should charge my phone away from me sure like that would work and then he will only sleeping closer to the tragedy so she
did you buy anything for black friday are you sure I thought if you have swiss then then you cannot eat something with collagen or what I don't I thought you have really
your first opinion said I had then second
okay
you bought it already or not yet
how many thingy from per bottle how many clicks per bottle
oh
shoes I thought you like shoes
oh
eh but you will be more at the office part right
huh you have to also track just in case they need to run out
oh
when when will be your off day what what's your working hours like
the duty area
because you take your off day in the middle of the week
I mean there are other pros and cons lah but the thing is
but nowadays if I buy stuff I notice that a few days later I not excited about it anymore so I try not to to shop unnecessarily ah
and some more you are recovering from your leg injury are you is your period coming
are you still taking the hormones meds
one pill one cycle is how long one month ten days oh okay what happens if you stop
would you consider going for the therapy yes I mean once settled down with your new job ah
cause I think you will
I mean I'm on a supplement
err there's one for lungs something for the liver and something for the bowel and the sleeping one but they are all quite safe cause it's plant based
oh okay my consultation I think because I think they charged me double I think is supposed to be twenty five or maybe the first one is fifty and then the therapy was ninety
but okay lah I mean I found some recipes online so err chick peas they are high in protein if you eat too much I'm still reading up about eating more plant based stuff lah so I mean I can slowly start by eating more fish instead of chicken and meat right
long beans asparagus
no because I had to do some errands at home
oh where's her workplace oh area
really colourful what do you mean it's so dead in
salad
their shop is based in only
salads actually salad is not a bad thing if you dress it nicely you get a healthier dressing I think it's quite easy to do that's why I wanted to do the salad
yes but need to go shopping first I know right the one at arab street right
what else ah yes can request ah
there's like meal prep but convenience wise you just buy the cooked proteins or the whole meal itself
or like protein muffins muffins where there is protein in it so it helps with uh this with your body recovery after your workout because you need a certain amount of protein
there's also like plant based protein I wanted to try that plant based protein
cause protein this stuff it always very like choppy the after taste
why
you can go home now just like that
like did they call anybody else to come
yes lah all the effort
hello
but not when you have a toddler that's what everybody will say
what's that
oh
but yes I had this student we had to do something like what do you want as your dream job then he say he want to become a youtuber I was like what do you want in your video
I mean at least have the basic education first then you can do what you want
actually okay
junk food
I hope there's a I hope there's a meal prep for plant based meal really I mean it's supposed be easy lah to to cook plant based but you just need to plan first like the ingredients that you are buying how many servings can you cook are you okay eating the same thing everyday for the next few days
I mean I doubt we can eat the same thing only like two days max or three days max
I mean there's always a first for everything
onigiri onigiri
do you have to like open everything first then warm it up oh just put everything inside first
and it was enough to
I mean there's a bit of rice there's seaweed a bit of protein
ah we wanted to eat sushi salmon mentaiko I think I'll just order that when we go to hei sushi yes you don't do anything else just that salmon mentaiko
I I feel like there's popular like poke bowls around area
yes bring me there
I think they open the orders weekly or biweekly
I think I let you try before lah the cuts I let you try before the say inadi with the rice inside and then like smoked salmon and mentaiko torched
let's go eat that tomorrow oh that snow beef bowl yes set meal for two
home based food or outside food
choose one

ya I don't know why I've no idea lah so that's why you have any place doesn't matter where
I mean we are going there lah but you have a recommendation where
mm
mmhmm
oh
oh
mm
mm
I think don't know maybe my parents they they plan they wanted to buy something
mm or any of the malls around there lah
ya
how to say that frustrating like you said lah take out handphone take take the
mm
oh
that time mm ya
ya lah that one is
ah mothers' day tau I think not the only one I think can see a lot of people got complain on that same
mm
that one I not too sure lah but you know they earn also not much
ya
err I think her mum lah her mum surely will will
uh oh
ya lah if you pay then I think cannot lah I think at least if you say
they refund or actually even didn't refund they say okay nevermind next time you order from us maybe we give you discount or that kind of thing
twenty to thirty bicycles everybody is starting to cycle
since now they cannot travel they cannot go
more people
maybe I mean okay definitely cannot be full lah I think if they full also it'll be
safe safe distancing but they must be ya fifty I think makes sense I think so ya lor but if ya lah okay lah if you okay
famous
basic
three dollars lah then
you go to hawker centre coffeeshop is usually like that lah but you go to restaurant then then you won't get that kind of portion
mm mm
I think the rain was
oh
you stay there ya lah will damage all the property lah
they just guess maybe
ya
confirm lah
oh
mm
orh
ya lah ya lah but mm
mm
ya lah the highest
I think the highest after in the
past ten years maybe something like that lah
name of the mosquito the aedes mosquito that one there's
mm mm
ah
the fever also they say it's it's just normal fever because unless certain people the complication the the thing they worried about I think is when you get high fever
ya so how to prevent
ya
ya in one day they have ya so that's why I think that's why the top three now is
I think still I think and brazil and then india ya lah but
population a lot so ya so it is so one day one day sixty thousand like
singapore is I think fifty plus
fifty five thousand but different since january so for them to get sixty in one day
I think it's hard to believe
singapore at least now I think ya I see the number not
that high lah okay compared to maybe three four weeks ago think everyday
like what four
five hundred or even more now I think like average daily like hundred plus
ya I know ya
uh uh maybe ya
ya I think so
ya lah but when this thing happened I think everybody's learning
not only the construction lah I think when the
so ya lah you can see that actually
ya lah some more these like these foreign workers all that think all these people ya lah if you don't without them I think ya maybe still in singapore life can go on but maybe not the same maybe instead of we complain
kan nowadays mm
mm
true ya mm
ya once in awhile jer lah
work from home
I think most places like still like eighty seventy to eighty percent still work from home can see when you
ya lor but hopefully the government will help them out
ya
ya but okay lah ya lah okay lah if you still I don't know about your office but I think most office
most of the most of the business
true
ya
two to three hundred on transport food
mmhmm
whenever you on the fan lah you on your laptop cause usually
ya
hopefully in future if they do that and then at least people got more what you call that work life balance
ya true but ya lah but funny
a'ah
ya I mean like once in a while
ya I think this one all is
it's a way for them to to maybe err get people to stay home more
ya but not
activities at home like I think a lot of courses also like ya lah like I also I'm taking part time course but now e-learning some more online you don't even meet you don't even meet your
ya
ya
okay
ya lah
but all the all the
all the government is doing is is is trying to I think promote you know make people stay at home more
even the kan they do everything at around your what you call that
mmhmm
ya
postpone postpone next year
ya millions of people lah
okay lah but better lah like you said just now
take a take a break like everything even that time when the circuit breaker like you can see like a lot of if you see news
err can see some animals on the road
ya
I think maybe also good good for all these you know nature
all the all the I think I saw
less polluted
cause nobody go there right
ya
ya so actually for for nature I think this COVID nineteen thing was a good thing lah it's not all bad
ya even even other countries also I saw like they they err those india and china those populated countries who have like err haze or fog all year round ya because of the COVID nineteen
mm you don't need to to shop or you don't need to travel I mean in in basically
ya so even if
you don't travel doesn't don't mean that that day you stress or what you know that that year you don't get to travel you stress yourself out still you you are you alive what you are not dead
it's like the end of the world is like ya hopefully
another I think ya another good thing after this thing after this err COVID nineteen also then you can see a lot of people discover new things about themselves suddenly got a lot of people can bake lah ya suddenly ya cause I got
has
ya lah
mm ya right
right
so I think ya
true ya true
ya lah once in awhile you complain but that doesn't mean that everything is bad because everything if everything is bad then maybe you have to look
at yourself ya
ya
ya mm mm
ya that's what I mean lah ya
other countries other countries they locked down like
not bad what like you morning or maybe they just that time I think they restrict like you you got number card you can go only this day this day but still you can go you know
mm
I think I think so I think first time then after that
ya
mm

I forget my my waffle is here
oh ya cyprus is in the mediterranean it's next to the it's err turkey and greece in between
that's why greece is known for the santorini right so cyprus is something like that
does turkey have beaches like this because it's right next to greece I'm assuming it has to
mm
ya so
it's a nice place I've read about it
the our master bedroom ya
mm what you want later I buy after this I buy
I you know I want I want the the err flashbacks right one says that time so ya you know you don't like to name you you maybe you will you not so impressed by the new version but I think it was good

huh
so the you know that thing is called a segway right here where you don't need to walk you just drive so the owner apparently use err
use the segway and just drove off a cliff and died ironic right your own emergent killed him
I think segway is a very err lazy way like you can walk walk ah I mean unless you are like a a person who has difficulty with physical physical task if not just walk
no peacekeeper there these people the you can see
err cyprus ah the they are they are neighbours what
orh we went when we had the car right we rented the car over there ah ya ya ya we went inside before the inside with aisyah oh really
for good
oh
on weekdays a bit hard lah
mmhmm
putri ah
the son work from home
that's the thing I don't like about the singapore the the mainly the bosses like
you can you have the capabilities to work remotely right you can you can you can do all your work and some more you are productive eh and your employees are happy because you you don't need to spend time two hours travel to and fro that time but yet they are the old school there is old school thinking I need to see your face and you as you are physically in the office I need to see you to know that ensure that you are I pay you according to the hour that kind
they don't care about as long as I finished my work I do my work properly hundred percent give you everything is fine no they they are not like that it's err very frustrating
but then then ya they treat you like like kids you know I told you right before they they there's this company in singapore they give the employees all of them uh checklist err time stamp
so like okay from ten to eleven what you do from eleven to twelve what you do like you got to report and give your hourly report to your boss I think it with that right you cannot cannot even do work because you spend time actually filling up the the the the checklist because you want to remember what time this what time what time what time lah
this is the the the obviously the border town but I think it's the same as greece their orthodox christian ya
what is your opinion on aldemir
is he is he a good guy a bad guy or just no opinion ah
I think that that they are a bit hypocritical when they they criticise like saudi arabia not defend you know saudi arabia now it's very err it's I have to say this saudi arabia very disappointing the king faisal the family like pay slackers give them money and they are rich and they want investment in the in the place saudi arabia is a rich country but this is very disappointing that the people who are supportive of the the the like what happened in the programme in china
of what
what's on oh they watching or what
by who
the government
they're pragmatic lah ya ya
okay this is asking for trouble
he is lucky he didn't get shot eh honestly
ya obviously you gonna you gonna get
don't don't eff around man in in other people countries it's not right lah you
he's not gonna get in

wah hazirah seh
ya it's been so long since I heard from you and ah ah I'm doing just fin
three years and graduate already no
mine is like no exam or whatever just project after project and my course currently taking is visual communication but look at you now working full tim
so since you the graduate righ
I'm curious what full time job you currently doing no
that's so shag you know since this pandemic like what ever since march or something it's like affecting everything well we at home watching and just feeling like me myself but what to do right adult life and that's how you gonna face through out an
I think you can follow up like that too I gues
right degree lik
no matter what you take for example for diploma or something people will just look at higher certificate nowaday
and oh it sounds interesting though and I wish this COVID thing is over so it'll be much more easier for u
an
I think you can cope lah knowing you for so lon
and time management is the main key like I said before and you know this pandemic I'm having online class and my eyes degree keep increasin
s
and what's new right holiday we just sit at home no
can'
it's lesser things that we can do also now this COVID it's corrupting everythin
mm why not we go karaoke or something and talking about karaoke I kinda miss how we all use to g
like back in secondary school but if you want to go out also limit also five people so it's kind of hard lah cannot bring everyone with us well I'm currentl
in my semester break for like a mont
for example um maybe we can do like it's a a three star hote
you want to check the place out plus it looks like those kind o
korea hotel if I'm not wrong with double decker bed lah but don't have pool so I don't kno
maybe we can find something that affordable an
more fun chillax place lik
wah really that sounds nice since you've been to lyf hotel before so you roughly know how it's gonna be like but right you're right if we never get a hotel which come with a pool can just chill watc
like around town are
hmm but righ
I think we can just search mor
so that we know and plan out early where to go and suc
and yes I like water activit
and if I'm not wrong I think you got send me before the link like like there's kayaking swimming and all those fine things maybe why not we give it a go since like what seventy five dollar for vacation if not interested we can jus
go staycation just chill at the hotel jer and since I'm single and you've got a boyfriend I just nee
err my friend say it's not bad though it'
it's like a bali vibe someho
where you can just chil
without anyone disturbing yo
there's plenty of movies to watch for example mulan or something an
um new restaurant near marina bay and this taufik batisah
and many more that time I went um
um cafe hopping with one of our old friend with hidayu if you can remember her we wanted to try the taufik batisah cafe but end up it's like too many peopl
so we end up at this one random restaurant which call aline's cafe like a malay restaurant or somethin
but you know me I'm not a walking person s
I just end up at random place instead you remember about ayu righ
y
it's really shady honestly like it's only like the two of us in that caf
what to do you know me I'm like lazy walker everywhere I go I just grab or something I hate taking public for some reason cause I hate crowd
might as well bring the bring everyone is like so awkward only two of us are playing board board games
and ya maybe one day we can bring bring her along with us or just stay the two of us jer
and y
anywa
I want to say that um since you in a relationship you just have to listen to your partne
right don't really have the freedom to do whatever you wan
but I don't kno
how is it like to b
attached by someone and knowing you right I didn't expect you to be the first one to get attache
I don't know how you do it like so low key I'm so curious like how you know what I mean I'm everything I need to post like social media so it's hard for me to deal with tha
um but it's nice to know that you actually grown up and you know like wow the new hazirah take over the worl
but it's nice lah lik
I'm glad that we still talking until today and boys aside okay the important thing that is me and you need to have a staycation so you better tell me I still got like a few weeks left before I'm bac
same goes to yourself too and ya anyways you know my current job which is delifrance has been toxic so like two days ago I actually went to this interview wit

this job requires you to do this this this
it's just simple steps you know but then they expect you to have like oh five years experience in you know
doing that type of job I'm like huh
hello
I don't see
what's the
I mean also
the pay isn't good then it's tough times what right now
oh teaching you got a teaching cert ah
oh
I did I did apply for teaching though then um
and then they say that oh uh you don't have a teaching cert from no I don't why do I need a teaching cert to be a tutor though
ya but like
why you need cert for that if you just gonna be a private tutor I don't I don't really see the need
need for that it's not really
it's not like you don't feel like
it's good workplace for you to stay if you like a bit toxic
oh ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
that's the whole point of training what
uh huh
wah
right
ya
just just toxic ah
the it's work from home
if you
why you don't prefer
okay lah technically I come from a background so
most of my job
prefer face to face lah so that we
can do things chop chop fast fast just
you know
clients like we have clients
that come to us and then they say that oh I want you to make this app for shopee
so we will take in that project and then we will work on it lah
mm
you can say that uh I do
I do mostly the front end
it's called and design lah
so ya not not if you see
oh
ya they don't give the option in the skillsfuture kan
ya
the comfort of the home
ya
but my project requires me to work with
a few other people lah so
one part of the the programme is not working
then you have to like
do a video call eh hi how um
how the project going you know
how how to solve this issue and then takes like few hours to solve it
look at the computer and then there's
do uh oh ya
we cannot complain much ah because
COVID mah
forever sia
ya
err but I feel like
ah I just want to
don't you feel like
you lacking the human interaction
uh
only now what I get to see you so
but it's limited to five
ah
paitao
ya like
I feel you I feel you
like
you come out from your room and then you see their faces you mean
round the clock you have to see their faces I feel you
ya
how many siblings you have
what why oh oh because she's longer in a
a longer relationship is it
oh
oh make okay lah make kind of makes sense because
she got stable job she's she's um
she don't have to
oh she's not
she's a
oh so right now she's also finding for job lah
oh okay lah there's some source of income lah
ya considered a luxury ah because you have to have a stable job what you don't know what's gonna happen next right
ya
I get what you mean
ya
ya basically
I mean technically we are muslims what so we do have to you know
you have to like
we have to have right I mean we have to have the engagement services
services and then uh
the wedding services
that one I that one I thought is just a
really ah that one I don't know sia
oh really ah
what how long already
you and your
oh
how how long have you guys been together
uh I don't think so
almost three years
mm
it's really you man
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much colourful I don't have a baby you know you know I think it'd be quite fun lah because I don't have to work and then
oh my god I'm the
polar opposite of you
because err my parents think that I'm a workaholic
and err ya cause I
ya but I prefer to study and work so
at that you know
the stress level is there ah I I don't I don't really get much sleep I don't really do much but I I
I like being busy in that sense
um like I neglect my health a lot
my sleep
so I'm a I'm
quite a workaholic
ya I'm still twenty five also I don't feel the rush you know to
really get married I feel like even if I get married now it's because that
I don't want to you know have a big banquet
for my wedding big crowd I don't like crowd I don't
uh huh
mm
ya lah I feel like
no I feel like I want to get
H we want to we should get first then
um you engage first then after the engage we set the date right then
before that we need to get first then
either that or you have to move in with your in-laws right
like I feel like it's quite crowded lah
house where you don't have to do things under your parents' rule
especially if you are a girl right
especially if you are a girl ah then they expect a lot of you
female
get out ah
mm
mmhmm
are you will you technically will you be shifting to your
to your your technically your boyfriend's
place or will you uh get your boyfriend to come over to your place if you were to get married
bigger house go there okay
zao zao
mm
a'ah
mm
well okay lah actually
oh
no for me my
my boyfriend's place is just um
just enough for his family ah I cannot really move into his place
so
no uh um
then what you feel what
oh
I think that's most likely you know
ya my
they move out I don't I don't hope for them to come over
no lah it's not like I don't like it's just
and I got
cats also and she's scared of cats
my
yes
she's very scared of cats though I I not sure how it's gonna turn out
hais
six people is too crowded already bro
I cannot
ya
I
but I really
how about no I should get rid of the person instead of my cats my cats has been longer okay
are staying longer at my place
but just two cats lah
but
some people have like six
seven cats you know
I saw that coming from a mile away
huh ya lah basically jurong
people are weird I understand I get that a lot
okay they always say jurong people are weird
I I have to admit ah because down here there's a lot of crime that
steal underwear kind
um okay cool I didn't know our area got a lot of
weird people
I
I like nowadays I don't
ya
ya
jurong shady ah jurong
especially the west side
country
there's a lot of uh there's not much of commercialised building it's more of uh
industrial building
so a lot of um
foreigners there lah
a lot of foreigners there that do not follow the law
in terms of police or anything
no no
I don't like that although it's quite quiet at my area there's no traffic there's no noise from
you know or vehicles
but
you will be scared lah because
uh all around us there are people
especially
guys because we we're we're told you know that my area our area there a high crime rate
and most of it is consisting of molestation um
those um touch and run away kind
thief you
when you're not looking or some of them will just follow you back home
I have many cases where I was followed back home like from my house kan
I take I walk from pioneer
it's like a ten minute duration
so while I'm walking back home
like I feel that uh people you know walking behind me
ya
there are people walking behind me but then
after a while you notice that they are following you or you know uh
they even take he even took the same lift as me
uh
you know this watch group
basically they watch group
ya
events kind of stuff you know so there's any crime or anything they will also know lah
so I told them about that then they raised it up to the
the members and then the members said that ya a lot of people have been complaining about this guy who has been following people home
weirdly enough
creepy
what
I
I would confront them but
I'm a very small person
more daring
you are more daring
ya
fight ah come ah fight ah
ya
ya ang mo kio
ya got industrial places what there
uh huh
ya I get you
if you know what it's always like that though
I would rather
tanjong pagar still not bad what
tanjong pagar still not bad I feel like around cause my
at city hall
around there
I cannot ah I just for me I feel I get
anxious over crowds
so I'm not a crowd person
I I cannot deal with big groups
I prefer to
stay clear away from that
so jurong staying at jurong west is quite fitting for me lah you know in that sense because
nobody exactly lives in jurong west
some more it's the last few stops so
there's not much people in the
ya it's it's too quiet it's really quiet it's it's quiet to the
okay lah I mean it depends lah
jurong east also considered area but then
what's that area called ah you know hua yi there I forgot what is it called but ya
there are areas where
it's not far it's not really far away from the
but it's also not close to any
no noises lah you know if you prefer that
ya
oh
ya
used as back up right now lah because of COVID
ya I feel you man I also got some savings that I thought like you know
err rent house somewhere near my office also
somewhere more accessible ah
no not at town at least like
maybe at most
east side ah cause east side I know
east and north side basically is
you got direct transport to town what
ya but my area my west like we have to
okay also direct transport but then
it's really long ah
and it gets crowded
at my area boon lay there you know so
I don't do I don't do again I don't do well with crowds ah eh
what to do
I just can't
what's that called your
currently your plan is what
to
ya like cause you were saying that
you prefer to get married right now right
oh
mmhmm
ah
eight years is a really long time
so
hopefully he will change his we it will because you got say before that he is madam

just spendings what
ya that's like totally different
don't we all girl don't we all
your boyfriend what race
your boyfriend what race
what race

how you guys met
how you guys met
ah online dating
ah for for me I feel like thirty five still quite young though
I I actually I
uh
with my current partner now
oh okay
your prime age
ya
but you have to think about the cost and everything
cause my
ya my my boyfriend is also uh
chinese but he's a italian chinese
he's more of the european side
so
I feel that there is a communication barrier between us lah but
uh
that was it's still okay lah it's manageable
uh in terms of
uni ya cause we same we same course he's taking the same course and then we have similar interest which
which is uh gaming
you game also what game

ah
rapatkan sangat kecuali pasal waktu kerja
mm
mm
we need to have a balance of our life and work wait work commitments from time to time
consider of uh finding something else lah like what you have done which is good
we have to be answerable for our own actions
same like when you go to your new work place you have this kind of situation whereby politics comes in
ah consistency how you want to keep your consistent ah status
making sure that whatever you have done
ah you do it you must know what you are doing you cannot affort to just like ah do something without knowing what you are doing correct ah
kevin you remember kevin from covalent aircon eh kevin
yes correct ah you are right I spoke to boss about this matter I told boss we need to give a waiver
huh
ah so it's fair for us to ask him to quote but hopefully I think he can quote for the motor no issue but to quote for the air issue he may not want to quote
you want english you want malay you want english or malay or you want korean
do they have muslim in korea
tomorrow they are coming down right to see the exhaust thing lah correct tomorrow you follow me lah help me eleven to eleven thirty
that one we settle first then number two right ah
I will bring him to see victoria you know that same place victoria
so you can assure victoria that you are also come down and check your due diligence
we left already fiona told me eh rasyidi you say wrongly this one not by landlord this one by tenant tenant tenant tenant
she will send an email to the tenant to say that those who install are tenant so tenant have to maintain
the faulty full meter sensor right I think they have to get
their own contractor to to repair I mean at their own cost lah
whatever they do is all at their own cost correct including for right correct
not yet but this lady is is very fast this new tenant she is very ah
very fast and she really wants the the so called this
cylinder part outside you know the gas part outside later I show you outside
later I show you ah the units half right half the unit they going to do that that means ah
if you see halfway through right from the glass entrance
people will go there just to buy food and go away ah and maybe just a few seats and tables and chairs lah
then after that they will have a raised platform right because we they we raise the height right correct for the for the for the pipes
no the you mean the cement eh
the cement will be the second half of the unit what second half
it means it's not the for the front tau the front will be rental it would not go up huh
maybe they have to put some
they can go to the level one toilet
mm so
they are not going to be easy to handle they are very demanding
ah a lot of submission concern about this then she say you know what know she say that oh the sprinkler worse ah don't need do submission
her consultancy ah the sprinkler actually bring down right the sprinkler for the kitchen hood all don't need do submission
you do modification you need to do submission to correct
and then she's using fire to cook of course must
ah to but that is for the gas installation
now you have your kitchen hood you have all your whatever right
you need to also do submission
they want to make sure that whatever you are doing is you know going to be safe correct
ah
ah
and I think this this few days I will shoot invite to all the
they got cash flow problem
if there's an issue then they share with us it's good for us to know correct ah of course they can deny lah but of course you you know their problem
oh actually I will get my specialist to contact you okay fine

ah next week monday kan
and you can undergo a unit where a haggard ah then I'm going to my muscular that gotten my email and

no need to rush to rush ah we just tell them okay this is the powerpoint
this is the ah rooftop what key we going to draw out right right
ah so far so far ah so far I I have not seen them doing that
correct so safety aspect they may want us to provide them a a more secure ladder which I will get lye to quote lah
I I I think ah the new ladder doesn't matter lah correct justifiable correct
because they are our term so they need to access quarterly or as and when
nevermind boss you can smile until tomorrow boss but my appraisal boss

um so if you are an avenger what avenger will you be
and why
so
ya
is that your final answer
lock it in
um
I would want to be
um
I think I wanna be
iron man
it's boring but ya
because he's rich
and he has lots of gadgets
pretty cool
and he is cocky
but he's nice and cocky
I like him
ya like you know like if on netflix there's a lot of avengers movie I I just watch iron man one two three over and over again I don't know what's wrong
but ya
err
mmhmm
um got thor he's rich he owns the thunder
ya exactly
exactly
um ya um but ah you mentioned you don't like avengers what actually you like you like
superhero superhero
oo why why why
mmhmm
I watch all spiderman
but like toby maguire he's just so sad
ya he's always sad like
he's always sad like it's so hard to find him happy only towards the ending that also I find it sad
it's just naturally
it's like awkward when I when I look at him smiling
err ya
sad
ya
err ya um
any recent movies that you are in
mulan
cartoon
damn I didn't watch that
um binge any binge netflix
I know right
I love it man mm
um recently I'm more like I watch toughest prison in the world
interesting
mmhmm hmm
it's very interesting um norway
has the most luxurious oh my god
it's like it's better than my home
they have a supermarket in the prison I'm not kidding
legit they use card to pay and nobody steals literally like what you see here
like cabbage um milk chocolate everything
I know right I know like it's like I know um apparently they spend one point two
I would I would I would understand why like there will be like question arise through the taxpayers you know like cause all these are taxpayers money so the ya then err that the government grant like why are we spending so much on these criminals um but err
I I I think it's very
it's it's so humane and humane possible to reshape reform these people because their rate of like relapse it's a very low so like um like they managed to bring down the percentage to thirty percent
um of people bring the criminal back so that their whatever thing there but it's a bit too expensive though um ya I would maybe cut down a bit of budget and you know grant it to give to the poor people or whatever people who has lost their families during the criminal like murders or whatever ya maybe they're spending too much ah
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
ya true
until court orders they can detain for eight years ya that's so ya
like philippines is already so poor and you put these people forty years in prison
like you were just making their life a hell on earth
like like literally when I watch the documentary the the the narrator was like
was like saying um
err the philippines prisoners have seen hell on earth cause it's really it's overcrowded there's no facilities
vulgar ya maybe can um ya maybe don't show the norway one it's so nice
ya I mean
but ya of course not all they only pick the
different
because like err norway like norway spain sweden they all very big country so they not only have one prison they have a lot of prisons
ya so they only pick one like the highlight highlight one ya same ah philippines also very big so they only pick one highlight it's an interesting ya
mmhmm
kan
mmhmm hmm
mm
mmhmm
for black friday
no I just want to make sales I'm like I'm still thinking of mechanics
ya err
ah actually sells a lot of shit ya so she just opened a new shop the one that I share with you
ya ya ya repurpose those vintage whatever crap people will buy
um actually it has been going on for a while like actually like when I spoke
ah
um
ah they actually have a stamp at the back ya so she cover that
do the mechanics for ourselves ah to paste the thing and everything which I really want to try because because she said that she engaged um someone from japan to do this and her cost price is really high then I was like thinking maybe I should just do this for her lah then I just take commission from her you know what I mean because it's the same thing ah if I could offer slightly lower I earn and then she also can earn what
and she don't have to charge so high I feel like she charges too high like she sells a pendant for about hundred and fifty but to me it's not worth it for a pendant because number one it's not gold
ya mm it's stainless steel
it's just too expensive for me I cannot ya
a'ah
mmhmm mmhmm
so not planning
to use
mmhmm
Maxi Cash Maxi Cash
per gram tau

ya I will scare like it go higher right
no no no no
no no no that's not the way you need to the see the amount of the gram need to be lower so like if it's fifty dollar it's worth to buy and then
when the gram go higher it's to do sell
no no no no no I mean you can sell now feel free
ya you earn a lot ya so it's a bit hard
ya mmhmm

he's a plant hoarder
no he just buy all plants and he grows inside his room
err ya ya so he buys all those
whatever crap
he's a legit err ya I am not surprised
it exotic plants my friend exotics ya so he and then he sells ah at a higher price that's his business he earns so much more than my lashes like he can earn about seven hundred dollars per day when he has the the the one ah the plant that people wants
since it's real
I know right
which is a
a lot of resales from Carousell
then he then he open a new
he open a instagram ah just let it grow by itself is not like hard selling it but there are people buying

mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
but he's suppose to follow up
he tell me to give him until monday I am fine but ya he's supposed to call me I mean he's not suppose to call me but he's suppose to counter ya because I told him I am going with ashley cause ashley meets
my budget and even though the multiplier is as not much as but it covers pretty much the same and for now it meets and then and also ashley said next year I can apply for full coverage if I don't have a relapse
record ya then I told him that then he said give him until give him until monday lah ya so I gave him until monday cause I don't I don't mind going to him but you know I need to think more myself cause at the end of day I am still taking the critical illness plan I don't mind I mean I won't want to support you if your budget supports me ya so I don't know what is he coming back with lah
but ya is generally expensive it's just more costly
like like uh if like ashley said if I have the same budget as what adam quoted me I could get more coverage with her ya so like I don't know what's the plus point of so I guess that what he is trying to find and can can get back to me
no no because I don't have surrender fees mine is just a basic coverage because I cannot afford surrender fees at this moment
ya so adam was supposed to
get back to me on that but he's not

err you still go to McDonald's or wait for samurai burger
or any of the shaker fries
what's your favourite menu on McDonald

I heard your sister also take photos
oh um
I heard now
oh
I only watch drama at suria
okay maybe I will
but
in suria
um I don't know if you watched but is a classic drama is a local
uh show
made by suria
no lah uh I'm glad that
Netflix
watch any movie anytime anywhere
uh and you also
so you need to wait for a few months or
probably go to another website to find
your favourite uh show or anime
so now
Netflix
ya basically
that's been our life for
long
just
sleep
this is what we do everyday
ya I don't really wake up early
so I'm more of a afternoon person
so once I wake up
but it's already late so I've nothing much to do
um
eh um
sorry
ya I don't know what I was saying just now
then uh maybe
grades
and um
uh
so when do you graduate
two years
um
I only left with
four months
um then after four months
then
um just
work
then uh if there's
uh school school uh if I want to continue studies maybe I will continue with
diploma
then are you planning to continue your studies after diploma
I think for me
this day and age I think it's time to work full time
because with this COVID
so it's best for me to work
and at least have a stable job
so I don't need to worry about uh
uh money anymore
I
okay with
because uh
but ya
good that uh I have a friend like you
err that helps me a lot
so
ya during your secondary school days
sec one sec two I join
I didn't know
join rugby
so I've
played rugby
ya so
rugby err
is with me since uh secondary school
and now I'm in a uh club
uh tamoko lions
hobby of mine that I can release my stress
and
I can see on my uh
meets
ya
uh I recently got injured because of my bad leg
but the doctor say it was nothing it was just normal sprain
so I'm glad that uh nothing happened to my right leg
then how about you
are there any injuries
orh
um when I was young I like extreme sport
um
err then uh
secondary school I go to
err
skatepark and I like skateboarding
uh hopefully that
um
speaking of commitments uh I think
err
after
work
I hope I find someone that I could marry
what I meant is
I hope that I will marry her and
um I think
they are having confusion about phase three
it's hard for me to wear
mask with spectacle can't you imagine
you know how terrible that is
so that's why I wear spectacle
but spectacle and mask is not a
good cohesion
good combination
that's why I keep reminding
my friends and close ones to keep a distance between each other and always wear their mask properly
ya
decided to wear their mask under their nose
I always remind them like you know to cover their nose
ya
because I really want to travel and go out and
spend more time with my friends and probably err go out in an adventure
but I don't know whether it's true or not but
I hope is a false news ah fake news
so uh I really want to go karaoke with my friends ah
and for my girlfriend uh probably go out on a date
somewhere uh and you know
have have fun with her maybe go arcade
oh
uh anything that's you know that can be used in singapore
oh ya um actually
err go staycation at least
I have never been before so at least
oh uh
um
I thought it's going to be fun like normal days when
so it's very boring for me
I hope phase three comes soon and we
ya the first thing I will do
right after COVID ends
is go sentosa
uh go beach with my family and
and uh you know swim
um I'm not afraid of heights
are you
um
but like it's different experience from
like roller coaster I don't know why I
afraid to take roller coaster
I'm
of roller coaster because maybe the speed and just and it's like
um I don't mind it goes on a straight line
is better than a roller coaster
I enjoy
riding on a car
and going fast
actually
because I like to go fast and then
when I watch YouTube err like for example drifting
I hope I can do it in singapore but
drifting
and
make it as my
professional career
yes actually
uh I've been
wanting to be a racer since I was young because I like car so much
err when I was in the bus when I was young I can name
any car
that's in the road
um my favourite car is
uh
uh
uh is really
fascinating when you know
more about cars
um
my favourite car is mostly uh japanese
for example uh Subaru Mitsubishi
ya any type of japanese car is my favourite
um
tokyo drift is one of them
ah actually
but I only watch till
and I watch uh
way before ah
uh nevermind skip that
ya the reason also
is paul walker because uh he also like japanese car and his favourite car is nissan skyline
and I I don't know how I've been supporting one club for
err like twenty years
in fact that
support the same club
man united shirt
um
and uh the manager himself that uh brought man untied to win uh
twenty titles
man U
but they are still carrying on with their winning ways
and now
uh they have a new manager which like is a man united legend
ya sometimes you need new clubs to
win you you you can't expect
one club to win uh all the uh season
and err what I heard recently
liverpool have won their first title
after like nineteen eighty something
so
while man U have already won twenty times
if
you know sometimes you need a good rest and
uh probably freshen up your body so you can prepare for the next day of work
ya uh um
mm
ya I also
err
go back into the normal state lah
and everybody starts to work normally and uh uh
ya
stick to the uh rules
we will not go to phase three
yes I agree with you so
we just need to
move on
and pray for the best

it's a small group lah not a big group so met the rest of my colleague and then um the place also okay lah not so busy last time used to be very busy but now um because of the COVID thing so companies send their
ah their staff
a participant they only allocate uh fifty per a company so just now there's two company so it's like err two company fifty fifty so it's two hundred people came but I don't think so hundred people came just a like about
less than sixty
oh I guess maybe fifty four two companies because of the err
nowadays the government very strict on social distancing so they decided to take small
I don't know because the deal is um they can't go to their
a client office right that's the problem so if they can't go to their clients office they have to cancel the whole thing and in order to cope up with all the
business sales so they I think they implement this thing is is in incurred into the charges lah
you otherwise they have zero zero business
they're not going to go for they are not going to have a health screening for any company so I think they came up with this idea of doing it it into one point
um the staff we staff we have two reggie one in charge ah one que
and one and then myself doing um
but surprisingly all the participant came for
ah
so when I say is it because COVID they say ya more relax
which is a ya it's a good idea later you want to go for health screening don't open up email first come here so you're will be just nice
mmhmm
ah she ah panic and she scared and she wants to play all the time
depression where she very quiet then she kind of very sad really low mood or but now when she have the dementia is going to another level she is more of anxiety I should say
cause uh every time she like fall asleep and then she woke up she panic that she miss her prayer
so and then she become breathless in difficulty in breathing and then she start screaming yelling and um
she start on saying bad words you know like yesterday we went through and see what are the dementia patient going went through right
and it's like it is it's not like those days at night only but this time round like the whole day the whole night and then or I could see that these are the
level
which is different lah this today's it's so much different from the past
ya
she's a bit timid lah I should say
I don't know maybe the my elder sister lah but the rest I think I don't know the rest are not really lah
timid is different from people who is fierce shah timid means scared of I think they need is most scared of
ya she went through all the assessment
she answer because she'll respect the doctor and the nurses there to ask her questions but she angry and she turned to me and tell me that uh these are all nonsense
but when they ask her what time is it which year how many children ask her to draw a clock you know that kind of things she do she she follow what they say and answer their question but err she turned to me and tell me of like um
mm mm
and then they will ask first they ask what's the date today
then they will ask you um
cute lah but a lots of questions okay not one I think about maybe hundreds questions that is where she become agitated
that was so that was like how many months ago that was like like last year last year january it'll last year december before she had the fall
november I think november that is when I know that she is having that dementia problem
no um
uh huh
uh huh
you didn't
mm
mm ya
mm
under the sovereignty you don't like it seems like she's continues dementia with all these mental condition you get like this you are who you are by doctors are usually like you know
mm
the signals they they progress to recover but people with mental illness they progress with getting worsen and also they only if I detect grandma or did it earlier
there is nothing much ah maybe slow down the process and understand her better but there's no way to stop her from going to another level no so it's quite difficult
for people with dementia of people with mental illness are unless unless people with
so is there any chances of recovery no right because once the brain stroke and then becomes more you know they say the brain shrink so the chances of recovering is not there
I think the only way for dementia people to on to tackle them is
to
um
ya they can't depend on themselves they don't even know themselves they don't even know
oo
uh sooner or later she she will forgot how to err right now she doesn't want to walk and then sooner she forgot how to use hand or to feed herself and then she like sometimes I bring her to the toilet she confused
before she could go into the toilet bowls you have to put the uh leg rest up are you know that kind of thing
so we have to tell her again and again a bit just
quite sad lah mean sometimes I also don't know sometimes is it good to get
um
I tell you if if the government doesn't do anything right now right now like
um
lot of abandoned or old people I think in years to come not people don't abandon babies anymore they abandon old folks
that is why I say
it's not so bad at all if you send your parents to a nursing care home it's not bad so we have to change those mindset people who says
the because people don't go through
so it's gonna be the same
old folks or sending nursing home is okay but not in asia we still haven't got that that
thinking of actually sending them there is so much better for both parties
that the children must take care die die children must be get take care of course you have to take care of her make sure she's okay with her she's fine make sure that you don't abandon them but putting them into nursery
you know I got a friend who the aunty they put err into the nursing home and then he actually my my friend got um cousin lah she could say ah eight boys ah the mother got eight boys
so everyone is actually eight boys so actually everyone take turns to take care of the mother but
so it seems that everyone couldn't take it because people have a both husband and wife working children schooling and then are having mother is like full
time attention should be given right so they decided to send her to a nursing home which is not cheap the thing everybody fork out money I think it's about two thousand dollars per month and then what they did
is everyone must take turn to visit the mother everyday everyday there should be at least one of her child come to visit and stay with her until she fall asleep
so I think that is a very good thing to do in a first the mother won't be bored because she got other people over there
and then second will be err medical attention given to her ah anytime twenty four seven because there is doctors and
nurses and then err third she got um caregiver which is also a caregiver which is also not like one to one caregiver mm they have
err nurses who caregiver I should say who come on shift duties you know um half and eight hours taking care of her another one taking care of a eight hours and then she also have her children to come and visit her everyday err maybe one or two children
the time so I find that is a very good idea to do that or it won't burden the
the children at the same time also the mother is well taken care by nurses doctors and I I should say professionals and at the same time the children didn't even abandon her come and visit her or maybe they brought her back
during festive season but I don't think so lah because she's already bedridden
um don't you think it's a good idea I think now we in in asia or should say in singapore should have this um
that's that's what my opinion is lah
ya I know
mm
or you mean like like the one I saw in denmark they have the they have this err dementia village where they have shopping mall they have a market supermarket that the dementia can just wander around you know than they have the
officers then is the place is a well said my securities well kept you know that kind of thing ya lah I guess in singapore and we don't have land to do that
oh eh you mean to say I was just about to say you mean the are they call the studio apartment right when they have the old folk and then they make sure that the doctors and the nurses are there to attend and then they have this emergency button inside their house which is I think the government build that
to to do to to
old generation lah
err
mmhmm
that's the that's the problem with singapore know they come up with a system or they come up with
you know like like like specially our money ah nobody knows that actually right now before you turn fifty five
when you turn fifty or before you turn fifty five you have this thing that you need to log in and says that you want to withdraw your money otherwise quietly they were just take your money
and put into retirement account hundred percent of it up you know
current affair or rules and regulation of singapore or the changes
that's problem lah people take ya ya
even that five hundred dollars the help thing right err your dad just got to know when he saw people queuing up the card err see see and then err this this lady said hey you want money you know you give out
so funny right then when he came back if a you want money you know you go and queue up me someone money the government is err err giving some uh help fund because I really apply then is it oh you apply already I don't even know I just have to queue up
that's about a long so quite difficult
true mm how to accommodate right
um
um
ya true
ya true so they don't really go into the point of religious lah I think the more points of
the exercise you know that kind of thing where when you talk about old folks is quite is quite um err
complex lah I should say how to handle the future and the future old folks generation
um I I am one of the candidates going to be into that
that that's it there I should say are citizen I'm going to be that
for example I just put myself for example what I want to do is I still want to be independent I want to have my own space my own house
um I want to have my own freedom you know that kind of thing so at err until what stage until the stage that I really couldn't uh take care of myself or I couldn't
I couldn't be I
one week to one house to another house or is it better that she stay put in a hug one place and everybody take
turns to look after you know I find I find ya I find
you mean you're not used to it that uh you have to go out to take care of the elderly
ya but don't you think that is teaching them a sense of responsibility
ah sense of responsibility thinking making them know that elderly need to be taken care of and then at the same time it's not that they come like the whole week they come like okay monday
ah contribute no that's what I think lah
I I mean right now this is
uh right now right now right now at this situation that I um
at present ah most of my err friends
mm
oh you want it to be naturally with their are sincerely go is it
um ya
um how you want to err how you
in this date this they cannot this did this date this is very special it's time for me to spend time with my mom and that kind of thing
so that is the first step that you can educate your children so in future in time to come they know that oh it's actually important and then mom is enjoyed parents is enjoying taking care and then they look forward and they find that that moment is very precious
um
um ya true
james I say my mum cannot be a one person cannot handle her at least must be two because one person twenty four seven can
it's really really take up the energy in the the the mental can can go crazy two so we have to divide
one in the morning one in the afternoon or then sometimes or if she really ah really at her peak both must be out at the same time so we need to person to calm her down so they understand lah
um that's why that's why I say some people I am some some just
you know so quickly the other
her character her dementia that she's having right now her dementia early development is really really educating educate me how to handle in future
because it's not easy really it's not easy it it's really not easy it's it's possible but it's just not easy it's quite it's a lot of patience mental
you know so I change my mindset I tell myself
because I know this is something that I need to go through I need to do it
to the rest of my sibling who doesn't
ah
now it's a time for them to take care of me
or as what you say lah don't you think that this is a reward that you are given to you yes I agree with that
I have the capability lah
the
um mm um
ya ya you have to change your mindset and then you always have to tell yourself
you are human you have feeling you are human you have err your energy level is our only that point of time eh is that much
and then you have feeling ah that ah you are human that you know that uh sometimes you can be angry sad cry you have to have all this
err emotional otherwise you're not human you are not robot it with you robot
mm
forever ya forever you be
ya
um ya true true
ya true
mm ya
breakdown
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
breakdown they can still handle it are they know the steps the the the manual they can open up a manual and then they know through a past experience with the machine is down this is what happen you have to switch on you switch it off
um um
somehow you were saying that family knows best lah
okay err family know best in terms of tackling one err let's say the mother lah because we know our mother character very well we know what is your favourite food what is
say right now when we're talking you can hear grandma is screaming err since morning they've been very quiet so we we try to
approach different way of giving her medicine last time we give her medicine all in the afternoon about morning she become cranky sooner you giving morning hopefully it can last up to afternoon so in nowadays instead of giving giving her once or twice a day be give me three times a day just to make sure that she is quiet
trial and error also
um ya true
um
so because chicken
oh complain and complain
mm oo mm mm
oo
easier for me instead of a she keep on you know rant and rant
um
mm ya
ya true ya true
so it would so when you have a when you have to take care of a dementia person you make sure that you always do uh a lot of research
research and research because dementia not only happen to our community our it happen to the world so every everyone in every everyone in
I should say the world world the global global it's a global err
phenomena is going to be as what they say pandemics you knows
ya correct ya true okay that's about all thank you

two so according to ministry of health uh we cannot have face to face interaction with um
the patients lah the cancer patients so
what I am going to do and I've told them I'm going to help with is the
so ya lah that's what I'm going to be doing for volunteer
so if
so it was online on zoom and what happened what happened was um they but they recorded a lot of people there were thirty of us
ugh so thirteen new volunteers so that that's pretty good um
so I mean there are different things that we
so I think the main their main goal which which is really why I joined um
uh how to do screening so they hold the screening the cancer screening
because a lot what we were told as as now new volunteers is
in case they find out they have cancer so last year they gave us the statistics last year the cancer society did a hundred thousand cancer screenings
you think so
so they want to see that we can do it and that we want to do it
ya beyond that I have to do more of course I'll start with what I can do which is what I'm doing you know for work and and all but
oh that's very soon
ah so the the money is like donated from you know from community from companies and and stuff um and they give they give
families so cancer society helps lower income families um with their expenses
next year lah next year when we can
so
you know just to fend for themsleves independently
and so they come and clean out and then they repaint
um they bring in
ya
so
mm
mm mm
mm
okay okay okay now I understand
ah
mm
it's quite near ya ya ya
okay ya ya ya
mm
mm ya okay
mm
ah
ah ya ya ya ya
oh okay
for the adoption drive
okay okay okay ya
ya
okay ya
okay
okay
mm
newborn okay newborn cats jer lah
like for everything
mm
has a clinic
okay
mm mm
mm
so only only donations from from people from the public
wow
ah okay ya
mm
like uh
property development uh
mm
mm mm
so what does have to do with that like what is the plan then
so you are saying when
that they know
all these uh animals are going to be there and they going to drive out the animals do they know this is going to happen and then if they do know
do they have a plan
which one is no
both
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
but this is assuming that there are still jungles for them to go back into
mm
where are the pythons
no I don't know
mm
ya ya
no it's your skin
uh the wild boars but what happens to the all the snakes
hello this is art ah by a very well known artist
ya I bought this when I was in dubai he is a um a a young and
really up and coming artist and
because that is deadly that is deadly okay with because
what is ACRES
microchip the snake
so are there a lot of
the lorries ya so there's
huh
uh
ah
oh okay
mm
mm okay
mm
mm
oh
but how much is the what is the
for littering
why they do that
oh I didn't know that
oh
who puts up these these signs
oh say
mm
and they're not stray cats they they are neighbourhood cats there are two of them that are that that are here in this block like this block predominantly and and around just a few other blocks yes they're community cats ya they are so well fed honestly
here they always they live around here ya so it's nice ya it's nice to have all these kinds of things but the dogs
under the lorry so when you know people started going back to work when it was what when did we go back july june june ya then they disappeared
and now they don't come anymore
I haven't seen them
the pied imperial pigeons we saw a lot so that was really nice but now
you I don't you go down to the park connector I don't see the otters anymore uh even
from the snails to the millipedes centipedes
all crossing your path and everyone would have to avoid them
I don't see the animals anymore
egrets once in a while um ya
it's just the regular birds the minahs the pigeons ya I I don't know where the other the other animals are
yes
mm mm
of sudden
but now there are people at the botanic gardens kan not like before
hmm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
like different kinds of otters
okay
what is that what fan club
this is this sounds too
they're so cute they really are very cute
the ones that went to serangoon road
uh ya
okay
mm
sausage sausage
mm
I didn't know about that
is do they like
ah okay
how do they
serangoon
so this kind of thing when again like when you develop land to build new buildings
and you push out that the native animals
assuming that the otters are one of them
what what what happens to them
that is is this something that ACRES
looks after the otters or so because in singapore it's become it's become like a source of pride for singapore the otters ya I never I never realised it you know I was away from sixteen years and before I went away in in
oh okay
in singapore
like at least five years when you
like heard of them
mm
snakes of course
um we had our chickens and
I never we never heard about the otters
in the nineteen seventies in singapore
otters are native to singapore I mean we have otters that are native to singapore
mm mm mm mm
okay that's new to me
mm mm
or feed the otters they they take care of themselves kan
ah
mm
mm
ya but now they don't do that anymore because people have back to work
mm
ah

okay
that was a bit loud
but
ya
good
so the video not that bad right
ya
a bit
the the jojo thing was a bit long though
like a bit like
but I like the jojo thing that's why
like
and if you get it you get it
ya
ya I mean I'm a small channel so it doesn't really matter
so like I I'm not even monetised
so like just do all this things
ya
ya that's the thing
but the I changed the intro music and the outro music
I don't know
ya it is but the
I don't know if it's better lah
like I know the outro was a bit okay lah
a bit better
because the outro previously was like meh
ya
now I think intro okay lah still what my second second video
so
so like I have like the
video wallpaper right so that one eats up RAM so when I ya so the thing so this thing video processing especially when you put like four videos running together uh then it starts to like ya especially when on four cores four cores is like the worse I'm planning to upgrade ah
saw online like two hundred fifty sia for a thirty three hundred X
and the A three twenty motherboard
four cores eight threads and then it's like a newer processor so like fuck it ah sia
just buy ah
because but the only thing is that that motherboard you cannot upgrade lah as in I have if I upgrade I have to buy a new motherboard
two fifty man
the because last time the thirty three hundred X was
it was always our stock but now I think a lot of people are waiting for the new Ryzen the new Ryzen five eh the new Ryzen four gen four eh gen five gen five ya they skipped one gen because they fucking misnamed you know their laptops were called Ryzen four
the laptop processors were Ryzen four and the desktop processors were Ryzen three
now is like they shift they skip one gen so they move from three to five so the laptops will also move from four to five so both are five
what happened
wow
then what they release it as
the fuck sia
but if he copyright first then he wins it what right
it's like if you buy a website first
buy it off him lah
but confirm he will ask for a ridiculous price but I think it happened
happened before what a lot of people who knew like this will happen will buy like a name or website last time I think happened to one of google's website or something they tried to
ya all the way
ya
ya but
but I bet it depends it depends on the company lah I guess
but okay lah it all worked out for them
free money sia
ya
Sony is terrible sia you know they don't allow discord on five I'm like what the fuck sia
ya so the only way you can talk to other playstation users
ya ya it's terrible eh
no the the thing is I'm like okay if you have a four chat you know but then now a lot of games support cross play and then you like
and then you don't want to like let discord and then like then these computer users have to use push to talk in your game then push to talk is usually shit
ya discord was the first one that was like quite good sia
after teams speak
but team speak you had to buy you had to buy the server
discord is free at least
ya
of course uh I mean I took awhile before I went to discord
whatever it is better than Razer comms man Razer comms was shit man
that fiasco I remember sia it ate up so much RAM everything lag
ya
not all
like
ya
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
eh for the life
ya like you know you go overseas you know and then like people pay then you take out the Razer card then you like eh my one got bro bro
ya
ya
ya
Razer is like so diverse is nonsensical
and then you have like the old models and then new models and then they all look kind of the same
it's like the worse sia it's like it's like err it's like err
ya it's just ya
ya
now then the people who don't know they buy the old one they got scam and then they like oo I thought this was the new one ah shit
then you like oh too bad you suck
ah ya
but okay lah
I only just want the only that's it
with
right
oh
uh huh
cannot drink coffee

but that's the point what leave in a big company you get paid what
unless take unpaid there is no unpaid there is
oh ya
or you take more leave then you should have because I think you cannot lah you
ya
take leave also go where
ya
ya
there you go

oh ya
ya that's the sucky part about transport allowance
like my transport experience you have to use for anything sia
ya
mmhmm

oh
ya
nowadays nowhere ah
ya in town no ah
ya sia
ya usually it's four dollars five four fifty
ya especially nowadays ah
uh COVID
COVID sucks balls
ya
ya
ya eh zero cases locally transmitted today I think and twelve
twelve day twelve twelve from ah overseas
zero ya
I think yesterday was two
yesterday was two
ya
at a very low number
they say what end of the year what
end of the year phase three blah blah blah
ya
can what now bangkok open what but then you have to stay there ninety days
oh same eh
oh really
why
oh
no wonder I was being seeing a lot of my friends in photos at australia so he went ah you can go
you can go ah
ya lah for travel ah
we are open to going but then
but then when they come when they come back they have to also lah
ya lah swab test is under no confirm got one all
ya lah
I think when you drop down ah
I know I'm not really sure lah I have to check
it's a lot lah fuck
payment lah fine
token sum
fuck
oh
because you like like considered like you increase the risk of COVID spreading is it in australia I mean australia got a lot of weird environmental laws lah
ya
australian or singapore
australian is
you know at singapore currency is stronger than australia now
after very long no
now is like their three thousand is two thousand plus
or what
ya I think
ninety cents around there ya that means means ours is stronger I'm actually surprised I remember last time people were like go australia one point four
then the currency drop like shit
no now the best place to go new zealand they don't need wear mask anymore
but then it's like
ya
no because you know why because we were prepared because we had masks we had a lot of things that we prepared we knew what a pandemic would happen you know
and I think
not really rod it's like a more like a a a a giant dildo shove up your butt
ya
really
really
I last last week oh ya oh that means it really surged sia wah
two hundred twenty I believe was like a week or two weeks ago only sia
oh my god
it's not flawed it's garbage it's hot garbage because you
ya lah
they have their own pricing on it ya like whatever different hospitals ah that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it they charged giving whatever religion they charge whatever for whatever treatment that they want to give and then and then like the bill comes out like siao lah
different hospitals got different thing
because they believing privatisation what
ya
ya
even if you have insurance right your insurance coverage eh only covers certain hospitals so reviewing the wrong place and the next nearest like insurance approved hospital is at two hundred miles away you gonna drive two hundred miles bro
then you got fucked if you sick or what good luck ah
ya even ambulance what they they try to avoid riding ambulances because ambulance is like what three hundred dollars
ya
the because you know why because it's the government they are not scared of like running out of money
unless government is running out of money ah then then but but that is unlikely ah
at the end of the day it's not a worrying thing so they like ah you owe money pay a bit pay a bit
that's thing
unless you got you pay late ah can got late payment ah
but there's no interest lah
ya
you know the new borat movie coming out soon borat
and then there's this video of uh donald trump's lawyer rudy giuliani
so the thing is right he was ah asked to come to the bed ah the hotel room of the borat borat two got borat and his daughter I think
so the daughter of borat supposedly lah ask him to come to the room and shit lah
and then I I think drink something or like have some cocktails or whatever lah so then he put borat put secret cameras in the hotel room like her room to set up it was actually part of the movie but the guy didn't know
ah so like she was in the thing right she was she ask him up to the hotel room and he come up to the hotel room ah then he was in the room ah then can see him like a touching himself and shit
ya and then after that the the borat came out of nowhere then was like she's too young for you she's fifteen
but actually the girl wasn't fifteen ah she was twenty four lah but at the end of the day he still got caught like touching himself like at some hotel room with this actress when she asked to come up you know like it's like his defense is oh he was taking out his microphone and then his shirt came out in a weird way and then he was just putting back the shirt in
so right now the video is not released yet ah but a few people in the media industry watched it ah like I because borat does this kind of stupid thing then he release it ya
so he does this thing then I think next week lah next week monday most likely the video goes public ah
ah no they he cannot what that is part of the thing part of the movie they agreed to it so too bad ah
borat does this stupid shit I I I actually quite excited and then he's defence is like that and then now the lawyer letter came out also so the lawyer have lawyer
that's how reliable trump's lawyer is that he has a lawyer I don't understand
ya so his lawyer ah the lawyer's lawyer is sending letters out for the media cause of like slander or some shit or like ya there's a video sia come on guys
no ah they all they all terrible
ya
ya
ya but
I mean you can believe whatever you want
ya
right they switch off right
but that's the problem right there is what the cans of top like to eat very the officer to spot because right now it's all written and then if like if you and your partner come up with a story and then you make a report
and
okay
tallies
is your words against the civilian and then obviously you won't trust a civilian what because supposedly he is the wrongdoer
ya
and come on if you want to talk about video there's a video of a man landing on the moon and they still don't believe you know come on people
that's why
like
why
why sia
haiya they I think they'll always plan for very long
ya
taiwan ah
the missile lah
taiwan ah
this is how countries do diplomacy lah
same like north korea what
because it's like the same what north korea remember they had a rocket that could shoot all the way to then everyone was like scared it's the same thing and then you know who came talking talk to them trump it's like that
it's pressure
because they know what
but really you know they won't pull the trigger unless because the thing is if they pull the trigger
there's a lot of repercussions lah it's like a butterfly effect kind of thing
I
no that's the no that's the thing right if they want to take over taiwan then it says taiwan wasn't theirs in the first place
the only sad part is actually taiwan defeated not defeated lah kind of curbed COVID better than a lot of other nations did
because china is
ya ya taiwan isn't listed as a country of the because china is part of the bigger heads of states what like it's china and a few other countries
republic of taiwan no
no
no
no
you can check
no they don't they don't list it as a country so all their data is invalid they take china's data
ya
so basically like their measures there or whatever or these things right they couldn't directly like
spread the news ah
like how they get the thing
no no the difference between taiwan and singapore is that we are not under another country
ha ha ha ha ha ha
that's the biggest difference boy
I mean hey are their own parliament and shit
ya but I mean the thing is they don't have international pressure
like not from malaysia like eh eh boy you mine
you know no one no one
malaysia busy fighting on their own don't have you seen the video
and then now cannot go back home
ah so he like that's why he not online
for very long already because lockdown back
then I was like uh
oh okay
why ah then he show me the thing then like the cases rose up because I think sabah had err election
and then after the election everyone went back then the cases all rise then the clusters came up again
but ya
when I mean
that's the thing you cannot say like oh that time they allow interstate travel like like their own states
that's when the thing spread lah I guess
I don't know lah difficult lah the policies they have also not very strong so
you know
like whatever man good luck to you
it's okay we we doing fine for now but I miss going to lor
to like buy stuff buy fuel
a'ah sia
eh come on ah it's one third the price bro that means eh I top up once every two days
so for me right if I instead of topping up like three times a week
I top up for the same amount of one time ah jer per week sia that's a lot of savings I guess like it drops my fuel cost to like what
eighty dollars per month only sia instead of times three ah two hundred plus
there's a lot of savings bro
but it takes a lot of time mah you travel there ah
every month eh
but okay lah takes a lot of time ah I personally don't do it because
jam ah
always jam
and then the closest one near tuas and then tuas you cannot buy anything cause it's only like the fuel thing
but okay what ah now got the discount what twenty percent sia for fuel
ya I I saw the one that's sinking right
ya because the thing is ah if fuel not leaking nobody cares
very simply put
okay if a ship sink right and it's laden with fuel right they rather leave it there
then try to save it and then it cracks open
because you are talking about millions of tons of not millions lah okay that's millions of barrels
but
like forty thousand tonnes may be eighty thousand tonnes depending on dead weight ah I think it was about sixty thousand
fifty thousand tonnes and if it was max load right and it's crude oil is not like those like process shit
so it's really thick
no
crude oil doesn't sink it floats and then it clumps which is worse than petrol like petrol spreads around like you know
like ya
would you rather that area or the whole fucking coastline
you rather the coast line
fuck you lah no
no you can just clear the thing don't let anyone bang and just leave it that's why you're not a politician okay or saving the earth the earth would be dead if you are saving it
ha ha ha
no expediting the process is donald trump man
very sad like he worked eight years sia for that would fight against the congress
you know and then all went to shit
just like that
not not not one person it took a whole nation to vote him
it took no it took a whole nation not to vote for hillary that was it
I'm like sial ah you all talk about emails ivanka also got emails what then no one cares only
don't know lah
then he then got mention what I remembered trump recently mentioned like if he lose the election he's going to run away from the country
cause he say he be embarrassed for losing all you know why or not he's going to run you know why
as it
he know if he come back he's going to sit in jail for very very very long
because I I bet you joe biden will try his best sia to do it
who
who
on fucking twitter of all the places them really ah guess how he want the millennium will vote eight years back in that they are few politicians who was actively like in social media ya that's
I mean because obama is acting on twitter eh bro
ya
now he still now he still
and first ladies ah
like melania trump nobody cares ah
ya I mean I I don't really care about the opinion of the country that voted trump up you know
I'm I uh I really don't care
who
valkrae
oh ya ya ya ya ya A O C A O C ya alexandria ocasio-cortez ya she she was the highest the most viewed stream on twitch sia the most viewed stream I was like oh wow but she a lot of people don't like her because they say like she radical leftist but really sia she's really good sia and she's not like
and people like to make fun of her because she like used to work as a bartender but then it shows that she knew what the hell she's doing and she knows how to work hard you know like like how the normal people did not like trump you know small loan of a million dollars small loan eh like okay bro
like next time ask for my younger brother one million also ah bro like fuck you that doesn't happen
like you know this woman a lot of people hate her but she very very how to say ah aggressive a lot of people don't like her
and she doesn't take shit from no one
she's very good she's very good politician right but then she's like same like bernie sanders you know they say like oh she's too progressive
oh err reduce taxes will be rich let's go
I'm like okay bro and then the rich like enjoy in their yatch all during COVID you know and then you all suffering lah begging for the one point two K every month every week or something and then trump
is one point two K every week eh
ya I think they got it once only for one month some shit like that
after that trump doing that's why that's why trump says COVID is over because he doesn't want to pay up to the citizen because he doesn't believe in that economy what he believes you give money to the top people the top people make money for the bottom people
it's trickle down economics you should read up about that
it really doesn't make sense no it it makes sense it's like a like a religion right to is like a like a you know like those evangelist like keep collect all the money it's the same ah it's like when rich people they just spout all this nonsense
to make other rich people rich and then keep the poor poor
because what happens when people get more money they're not going to create more jobs they are not going to like make my company bigger or what no they are gonna spend more money on themselves
what they gonna buy the a bigger yatch they gonna buy a bigger house
ya
that's why like you have to give someone who has four hundred thousand five hundred thousand then he's going to buy a bigger house bigger car bigger everything ah he's not gonna like oh let's give donate more to the poor all you think
they will donate what they can just to evade taxes
most of the time
ya
or like trump pay seven fifty
per year
oh my god
ya
no that's that's the thing no they were saying like ah the minimum wage workers pay more tax than he does correct oh my god I was like ugh and he was like I pay millions of taxes in a year
world sia
never right
kan ah
any proof ah I mean you can say it it doesn't matter but the thing is like we want the medical thing what
but whatever
I mean that's how his style what you have to believe him and nothing else everything fake news recently he walked out of sixty minutes
you know the the the those
like you know I think singapore used to have it also like like sixty minutes is like sixty minutes of an interview with some politician or what
ever but we used to have it but it got boring because we ran out of people to interview
for them they have like it's called sixty minutes so basically is like an intense interview ah like they asked all the hard hitting questions are for all these like politician and all these things ah
but this time it was trump forty five minute he walked out
he couldn't take the interrogation not interrogation lah the questions ah then after that he got
if you walk out in forty five minutes right then if you don't see forty five minutes of footage then you kind of know like there's something cut out what right or like sixty minutes ah like if there is less than sixty minutes you know it's fake what right
kan
ya I'm like
ya no no no cannot
no we cannot normalise his style his style is shit
ya
ya
terrible
terrible ah
that's it
ya man
because science is science is stupid what right science doesn't make sense what
because it's so difficult to read words
the worse part is that like he says I love the bible I love the bible and then it's like what is your favourite verse from the bible ah that's very personal don't ask you can't even tell me the verse like or paragraph or like where it's from or what then he's like no it's very personal so I can't share it I like that means he never read hundred percent never read you just use it
okay bro like cool story bro
I'm like what
so how how's your job you know like ah do you believe like trump's economy will pick up and then why while this guy's there and it's like
making economy great my business is booming and then he's asking like what what business are you in you know what are you doing oh I do uh money money money lending
his business booms when the economy goes down what
so I think then the guy like just laugh he just cannot stop then the guy is like I'm voting for trump then he like laugh again
it's like holy shit man it's like aww man these are the kind of voters that vote for trump because for them selfishly their business like when the economy is like the same what when somethings go down right when there's a down turn someone earns what it's not like everyone will lose equally
so like this kind of people earn ah like this moneylenders
like other crap lah that happens
like the obviously the ones that go down like like grab riders because COVID and all these shit transport
you know public transport and shit
all the same ah
but like this ah
public transport ridership reduced what
by ridership reduce then the
ya I mean as a general the drivers don't care but as the company you would suffer losses lah
at the end of the day is still a government agents like it's not agencies like it's like ya is a it is govern by the government lah so for them they not really like going to take the hit that hard lah
they are not going to closed down and the like oh no more public transport for singapore
ya but
ya sia
oh
period who go out not a lot sia
ya
work essential service not relays
but sad ah sad some of the really but lucky they got some subsidies and like you know
they had

but mine is collecting food so it's not not really at most you just come
at most I just come I I that time usually I I deliver one hour sia
after I get the order
I wake up then like slowly go to the bike
the thing is the person is waiting at home it doesn't matter
then the food the food doesn't they don't care how long they wait they don't have a say in it ah ah most to most the customer complain
most of the time they won't ah they might but so far my experience is no
then you chao
ya
but
ha ha ha ha ha ha
woke up into what about currently
you got burned bro
so he wanted the guy come down then was like I'm gonna eat your pizza mate you gotta come down here I'm gonna I'm gonna eat right here
ya
actually by right if got staircase then we cannot deliver up sometime a bit nonsense one
like
if it's like if you allow like like go up staircase like if it's one two floors is fine then if it's more than what if it's an old guy kind of like a bit busted to him also eh
ya that's the thing ah then it's like busted what then you have to come down it it protects riders more ah
if there's a lift you really got really no excuse ah
buildings don't have
I hate sia that one and then usually right the people who order live on the fifth floor
fucking assholes man
and then don't want come down
don't want
send to my door
yup
but it is what it is
it is what it is
wah sial lah that one I remember sia
that was the worst I didn't go supermarket
I was like fuck that shit
I guess sceptical help lah
ya
I remember during that period I went like
at like two to the grocery store
because no one is awake right
so it's like lesser people to fight with
but then the thing
they restocking around that period as well
ya
then got nothing for you
ya
ya
that's why ah
no lah mine got more mine got three or four three or four no mine cause it's twenty four hours
but mine they do the restocking at that time so cannot be two person what
the store quite big sia mine
it's not like like the one here the here is kind of linear what mine is like a weird shape so there's a bit of blind spot that the cashier cannot see
so they're going to have to have have two people cause one station at one area
ya
ah ya
ya that's the thing ah
ah okay
put the money then go jer
ha ha ha ha
scan yourself you know like
then you just go fuck off

I don't know ah let me think about it ah I kind of like this phone I mean it's not spoilt
no I don't plan on changing already it's very silly to change because if you want to change then I have terminate this line then just leave
ya something like that ah which means I just stay with this phone until yours can terminate then we terminate both but then it will affect the
the internet
I know but if we were to terminate this M one line then it will affect
no the home ah cause the home is a bundled family thing what
right
what what do you plan on changing it to
oh
singtel is so expensive

but with no sub charges ah
oh chey how sure are you
oh but you cannot change to singtel
same like ayim right
ya I kind of like M one actually their service is also good they have very excellent
no not just the service but the customer service is also good ya they are much better than singtel and starhub
segregate their customers like you can see how my father gets so such good service and then when you are like low paying customers they treat treat you like shit
are you sure
ya exactly that's what I'm trying to say
singtel always overcharge and then they
no I mean okay lah
don't say that you don't know though
ya it was it wasn't because it was in water ya sia it was a new phone what a terrible phone
what oh you cannot use expletive is it
I don't know I never check the things all that never say right
ya anyway we are not very vulgar ya as in dude this is like
an that is going to be assessing it it's it's not like they going to be as in like they they want to like
of course lah someone will actually vet it but then that as in it's not meant for like kids hearing or thirteen like they're not gonna be publicizing this
it's like a no not a campaign it's like a a data
no like a data collection so they can actually like uh
like collate no meaning they can like collate all the languages and try to like no ya which means install it and actually
make it into a language understand or not meaning like like
ya it's something like that cause they they cause it has to be spoken in singlish what
make the computer understand this language
ya but the conversation starter suck like the conversation did you read ya like

it's okay
ya
of myself which is not reliable because I'm biased myself
ya that's true
of course not why would I do that that's just digging my own grave
we are doing this for money could you have some pity on us because this has been a lot of effort on our part
ya
no the crotchet to my phone
then it came off then what's the point
ya that's true ah and then are you gonna finish up the star wars
okay why don't we try one question
ah please the questions are quite fun okay um
I remember the question was mm if you had a superpower what would the superpower
what would you want as a superpower
I think I want to read people's mind do I really hmm
what would you want the superpower to be
ya
fly
that's not a superpower dude
because he's rich
ah
really such a
oh ya that's true technically iron man also no but he has that stupid heart thing that doesn't function oh is it oh that's his flaws
ah
I don't know actually if I have a superpower I think if I have a superpower I will travel back in time
dude mine is the most superpower among your rich rich is not a superpower
no
what
no who say you can buy people uh oh my god the person who's gonna vet this conversation is totally gonna judge you for saying that
your superpower you want to be rich and that you want to buy your wife what the hell is wrong with you
your wife
I'm not gonna let you buy me
with money
I don't fall in love with people because of money
actually mm I don't know what a superpower be
then another one more was
last
huh one week why
that's not one week that's just about three days
ya
ya then rizal got stabbed then what else happen
oh ya I forgot about that also remember the one where the controversial no the controversial the one that
err
ya exactly so which means ushu have to still like be in good terms with them what
rahman sia
that's a lot
one week only have five episodes
ya
nah I don't think so because because I saw
no I don't think so no because there was one part where he held the baby so I think he already make
like peace with lily
ya that's true
ya but I mean
but after that they went back to the house what
that's very um vague ya
is there really circumstances like this
ya lah that's true ah
they reconcile again but like after one year or so when she fell sick remember
ya but
obviously we were just married
really I always knew that I was gonna happen lots of kids
I am a bit disappointed that I only have two right now
I wish I had more
yes and then when
whenever she's trying to share her good ya but when she tries to share her good news which means like the way she say it ah meaning like maybe she went to her mother and she say eh I pregnant again then the mother actually continue it with
really
I'll be so crushed like I'm sharing with you my good news
huh
but she bought herself a new house you know
they are shifting ah as in like they bought themselves a resale
I don't know lah he has this like grand master plan of five years sell gain money then resell I don't know
ya but the thing is ya but the thing is no matter how much you
profit from the house you definitely gonna still come like cash like fork out money when you have to shift ya exactly I mean I understand lah could be like few hundred thousand but
I don't know lah I also cannot be bothered I'm just contented with my house
like why is house so expensive now
exactly the toilet
go through all the trouble
that's not true it really depends
mm ya
ya lah true
no he he's definitely gonna get a resale though
ya because he wants to be near the de la salle
five years of course ah he's like that what which is good ah I mean there's good and bad ya but anyway seven by seven years old he needs to be back in the west like around choa chu kang area
how sure are you he's gonna be sending his kids everyday he works sia
alhamdulillah
do you foresee yourself sending your kids everyday to primary school
okay so then what happens when both kids have to go to school
inshaallah no but the car yes no no no no no I will send both
they both go to the same school
then
ya but for the rest of their as in like for the next few years preschool is definitely gonna be under the block what
ya probably lah
I mean I don't know but
where got such thing where got private
no all primary schools are primary schools ya it's just that affiliation
but do you really want to send your kids to but okay lah also not bad
can he go
ya lah that's true
inshaallah inshaallah
ya but that's the only affiliation I don't think they have a affiliation to schools do they
ya like
ya but because it's catholic school what de la salle is a catholic school
so
oh ya that's true
I totally forgot about that I was just thinking of all the christian school like affiliation to so where else oh I know saint patrick is also affiliated
ya lah that's true see how lah I'm not a forward thinking kind of person
eh dude
eh
what's wrong with that it's good what to be prepared

I look forward to it and
ya that is something I really want to do
and start up start up makes me it reminds me to a lot that happened during my early years lah

mmhmm

yes
err I'm fine thank you
ya
um I ya I I feel like this battery on this phone is is not gonna go well so
hopefully can record for one hour already present but it looks like it's twenty percent
it looks like it's twenty percent
I don't know maybe like talk about um
how our day went yesterday
how's your day
okay for me okay so for me um
ugh
I work as a social distance ambassador so
in this COVID period you have to tell people to like you know stay one meter and all that kind of stuff and then there was this like err couple
ah redirected to me and then like I I I ask lah hi sir how may I help you
um and so err
ya then then the wife eating the wife started eating her hot dog then after that will like
hopefully
ya okay hopefully ya
at your you're risking yourself lah to exposure to virus so
no eating in the store at all you know
rude lah so it's like my wife is eating not me you know that kind of stuff so we have this kind of difficult customers coming in and they're just like fully self entitled and they feel like
you know like um like we don't have a like um like we are like lower than them
correct ya so err
ya then the day before it was quite funny because um there was this err couple they went out
and then they changed their mind they came back in the thing was that so many people pass by you wouldn't even remember hard what their faces look like most of the time unless they are like outstanding in terms of their their clothes or hair right so this plain looking couple they went
back in hey but they're plain
so they were wearing like just normal t-shirt and shorts and then um ya so they were they came in and
err I was like hi ma'am have you taken your temperature upstairs and then she started like hey why you so rude you're not doing your job you know
damn like what because in my head like if I don't stop you from coming in from the exit I am not doing my job I'm doing my job simply because I'm stopping you right now you know so
you're very rude you know like why are you talking to me like this like like I'm stupid like that after that like it's like you're not doing your job you know you want you want me to show you my entry pass but the thing is that
even you show might if you even if you show your entry pass right you can scan it anywhere
before even entering the store so the only way I would know if you actually like enter the store in the proper way is by taking a temperature upstairs so if you take your temperature upstairs and you come in from within the store that is fine you know it's validated because like
you already went through the process but then you exited nobody notice you exiting and then came back in
from the exit and then you insisted that I'm being rude because I caught you
from entering the exit place then it's like err she was like oh like I'm educated you know why you so rude I was like piece of shit like
bloody bitch you know that I have graduated with honours
mother toot
so it's like what the fuck this happening
mmhmm
okay you know why because we are having this kind of job it lead it seems lowly that like you don't have education or you low education that's why you get this kind of job you know what I mean but at the same time ah they never considered that this kind of people
I even have like air stewardess air stewards um crane operators err tour guides all these people are working with me and they are having this kind of job as a security guard or as a social distance ambassador simply because
their industry is closed you know so like you're trying to find a job to put food on the table
mm mm
correct so how how how was yours how did it go
mmhmm
wah that is late
mm
my alarm lah oh my god
you know that's a typical um an err reaction from old people the audience be like
your mum's friend
okay
mm
mm
mmhmm
correct
mm
aduh
mm mm
that is right
correct
mm
I think I'm still lost but
correct I mean even until you die I don't think you'll find a way actually
mm
mm
alhamdulillah
an example but in that but at the same time to mature this is my my share lah we are we are we pick out of job because of question unless you are already
if you put your personal check with you if you want to be educated the person you would not help the person all the way to that at I not go or any other person does the same thing as you and only you lah as of now lah
ya because like I mean like for
I would try not to because at the same time like I feel that I'm putting sometimes lah like when I do things on putting myself too out there that like um I don't think about myself I don't think about my own welfare and I don't spend time with my family just kind of stuff
I mean it's great that you're helping but like ya I mean
there's a there's a limit to it lah in terms of like
like
it's like it's so rude of you to say that because why I'm helping you because you are my family but at the same time I do not um
approve of your behaviour even at your grandmother's funeral you are busy with your makeup
and like you know like
you know they're breeding this kind of inconsiderate people hopefully not but you know like
like you know like what we say before lah like we're not breeding because because because of our preferences and at the same time we also don't want to breed this kind children you know what I mean
I'm not saying that we're bad people but because we are we're thinking about it responsibility responsibly that's why we are not breeding these kind of people you know you mean but like oh my god there's so many people breeding and they all not really good people
and um
um for me because um
like currently the industry shut down right so I'm doing freelance that one can do at home lah which is editing video editing and then like the social distance ambassador which I do like five to six five two eight hours a day kind of err
ya correct mm and then like
is like you know like you love your father but you can I don't like my father you know
like you you figure your shit out lah
my mum know lah that he doesn't work lah
that's why she divorce him lah
you know
when I was in err primary one primary two
ya with that was like eight years old
I'm if I'm eight years old she's like twelve
ya so
ya ya
my brother one year younger so ya so
ya this quite long um
since I was in primary two ah I don't know eight years old um now I'm twenty nine so twenty one years old twenty one years ya but I mean
sorry
no lah she remarried and then um she divorced when I was in ya
mm
ya then like alhamdulillah like long time lah but my step mum also at one point wanted to divorce him because
he simply not working and not trying to provide for the family lah and then the other day he had the audacity wiki because my my younger brother my youngest brother he was talking to my father he said eh err I'm going to I'm going to the food court lah to meet my friend because my friend just got his heart brokenhearted like
I mean literally all he does at home is watch videos and um
and like he's working
sometimes I really like
like just err pray to god lah alhamdulillah my step mum is a nice person that she like you know that she is still wants to stay with him and provide for him because she did thought of divorcing and then like you know err one funny day err my youngest sister told me she's like
which is even I wouldn't want I I I love him as a father because
when I was working my full time job lah I would say I give like around one hundred and fifty and then my father I gave him hundred I put him in his own bank account that one what the fuck he wants to do it whatever the fuck he want to do is fine
but whatever I give my step mum you don't touch so um ya I mean like that's how I usually give my and then like the thing is that my father's attitude is so bad he likes to take money from people he likes to wait for money to be given to him
so we re going up up somehow you just like he likes to compare and power that lah
was to like maybe set up a mm maybe he shouldn't even have set up a family
but like he already done it and he already like
put her name inside the house you know because he doesn't want her to get the ownership
then he was damn lucky that my step mum will stay with him lah even though because at one time lah they wanted to divorce then we we advise them lah like as the older children we advise them to stay together lah if they if they can
why are we born in a poor family
ya because he he's he said like I triggered I triggered I triggered why are we so poor blah blah blah
then you triggered you fucking everyday you have food but you choose to eat mcdonald's
you triggered everyday have food but you waste it you triggered but now you have a fucking laptop you know what I mean it's like you are privilege you are just like it feels just like those err chinese people in society where they say oh I am disadvantage blah blah blah all that shit
but you have all these privileges if you are truly poor you don't have much food on the table you will eat rice and egg maybe everyday if you are truly poor you you wouldn't be able to
um on the fan all night long all day long everyday sleep in
mm
ya so ya I mean I'm
and I just like like what the fuck man
like you feel like they they would be better lah or you can benefit
ya I mean
I want to be productive as well that's why I'm like working but then at the same time I'm not earning much from this like job you know and my freelance doesn't come all the time
and the education system for me is too rigid it's like bloody like you're not teaching kids to think you're teaching kids to be book smart which is wrong because at the end of the day right
I already go through university I even finished university
what the hell ever I learned in school right most of it I don't use
correct so
mm which one the the guy ah
ya that bastard
that is true
ya but like um so like you were schooled in singapore and then you school malaysia now so like err what do you feel like what's the difference in the school curriculum the total atmosphere
then you can talk to about it lah until the time is up ah
book smart lah
mm
mm
correct
mm
mmhmm
that's great
ya you can tell from
correct malaysian and singaporean you can tell how they talk and the way they dress our fashion style and our the way we articulate things is very different
mm
mm
mm
it is
mmhmm
ya it's so fast right your time like oh my god
mm
mm
mm
mm
correct because the thing is at in in
in all these places are where um a lot of tourists come so the rates down there are definitely higher things are definitely more expensive because they want to rake in all the foreigners' money because foreigners will be like oh I convert
of course
mm
ya because you you typically like you like other people also go to malaysia thinking about the exchange rate but you should never think about the exchange rate because you are spending in that currency per se
mm
oh
lol
and then you can can with friends to baby gear dealership
I would think that you will like that kind of girl
ya
ah of course knowing you you would have dressed up
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
ya is your acts right
mm
mm
correct
mm
that's great internship in singapore
mm
mm
mm that sounds nice
mm
I'm really glad for you eh you are working towards your dreams and all that for me like I fulfilled my mother's dream now I'm going to embark on my dream but you're already on the way and I'm so like proud

oh
ya it was a skillsfuture fund ah ya
mm
err I mean ya lah I mean ah when I was with
with my uncle at my uncle's shop right
uh start to
ya still one year ya so total is one year lah plus
the the barber life ah barber life is um
quite unhealthy lah you smoke then you drink sugary drinks sweet drinks then
wait about customer then you got customer then you will cut your hair wait then cut their hair then after that
um audio audio engineering job lah because
eh but but honestly singapore
all most of the position are taken taken up already and now because like like
like this situation like COVID situation
there's not many uh studio recording jobs lah so unless you're really lucky then you get a studio where
you know they need somebody to intern or something then you will
you will get the job lah if not
you it's quite difficult to find find a audio engineering job lah
studio engineer job lah like recording engineer job inside the studio lah
err there's a lot of jobs like that but it's tiring lah ya that one every week you can get that kind of job just that it's
it's tiring lah but the the real job that I really want is to
to record for artist inside the studio lah that one I really have to find lah ya
err lah universal music and all that lah so a lot of those jobs are take up already so
err mediacorp lah mediacorp suria maybe suria but I I'm also quite sure there's already a
there's already an audio audio main audio person there main audio engineer there

I actually can go back to my actually I can go back to my
uncle's shop actually I can go back to my uncle's shop and and work with him and or work
you know but I don't I I don't feel like doing that lah so
so lately last week last week I actually applied for
I actually applied to work in seven eleven actually
ya I actually that I actually thought um monday since since uh like
monday and friday I'm not schooling right so
I mean okay lah the whole week actually I thought I thought everyday I can work part time like
from at at night lah night shift like I can work from eleven to
err eleven to I think
seven ah seven seven eleven near
near my house lah near my house like
ya so I actually applied for the job but
but funny funny leh I I didn't
I didn't get a reply ah they didn't reply me it's actually
but ya even I applied for seven eleven also I didn't get seh I didn't I didn't they didn't even call me back so
I applied for I applied for part time at yamaha also my old job kan
ah yamaha music asia I applied
then they called me back they say you're err ex staff right you're an an an an ex staff right then
I said ya then how come you want to apply for part time then I explain to them like I'm schooling right now then like I
ya I'm studying audio also so ah it's easy for me to
something for me something I got experience in right then I I can I can do it
easier lah so they they actually called me two times they already sent my name
to they asked me which uh which location you prefer
then
huh
ya so I I I actually applied for the that one right the the
the the yamaha one be a second time you call me you see which which area you can go eat exit policy
now I'm waiting for another call lah then they so far never call they're taking quite some time ah I don't know what's the
ya
ya
give up
ya true lah true right now I think
I think what my mother said to me was that err right now the employers I think they
they know that a lot of people are looking for job temporary because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
temporary only because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
I think the employers know that um
some people are not really serious about the job lah they just want to have a job at this moment because
it's ya you know like
a lot of people going through financial difficulties at this point lah so
that's what my mother said lah then I I think I think quite
true lah like like the seven eleven thing I think they know that
err I'm just applying
I think because when they when they look at my resume like you know they ah um
I'm a older production student in LASALLE then like
err diploma you know like why do I want to work in seven eleven that kind of thing so
so I I think they they they know that
this is just temporary lah a lot of people looking for
urgent temporary jobs lah so ya they know a lot of people not not really serious at the moment
ya
so
ya lah of course lah I I I
of course I feel like twenty when we were twenty plus
twenty plus
was a different was a different feeling different feeling like you can a lot more things then
then like um if I can turn back time
of course I will turn back time lah I will I will do mm
I will I will I will do my twenty plus differently lah I will do a lot of things differently
right now like age catching up lah definitely like um
ya getting easily more tired or you know like um
ya it's not it's not that
I'm not that fast anymore something like that
different lah when I was twenty plus I think I think I always thought that like
like like um oh I'm the best I can do
oh I can do a lot of things but as you get older then you realize you
um you realize
you're not really the best ah other people better than you or then you
you start to ya lah it's a different thing lah
because I I know because right now my in my class also I
that's what I'm going through also lah different you know
my classmates are all twenty plus right so
ya lah different different privileges
yes
correct lah actually actually true lah I I
ah I know I mean the the the thing is that because err right now the right now the
in so called millennial or
or the twenty plus right they
they sometimes they talk to you in a
in a in a different tone than than than
what people our age will
talk lah I feel like I I feel like our age people will have
ah nicely have respect for elders but
huh I don't know about the the the the current um I don't know about the
the the the current twenty
nineteen to twenty plus now I think
they but not all lah some of them some of them are I mean some of them really still
still still have
still have um respect for people respect for elders and
talk to people nicely I feel that
some parents really did a good job lah teaching their kids
ya really some some are not some are not I mean some are really
they know how to talk to to
older people lah so those kind of people I feel like
those kind of like my classmates I feel like they
their parents really did a good job in teaching them lah like um
like old old people old values lah old values like like um
like ya like how singapore was last time or you know
ya but some some are different some are like really they
ya they
you know ya but it's all ya lah it's it's all a small thing lah at the moment mm ya
mm
maybe ah because I got oily face or what then in the morning
in the morning I if I don't if I don't shower or what then I
you know my face will be very oily or what that kind of thing then that one will
okay lah that kind of thing but maybe maybe maybe
I don't know whether it's a
mm
pass very fast lah for me so
so a'ah lah
was more relaxed lah more
laid back chill ya
so um
COVID I mean
mm
apocalypse no lah
imagine that imagine that everybody everybody
like fall sick everybody became zombies I already thought of that already actually
but then ya
but but so far I mean during during COVID
period lockdown period I was mostly working I was actually going to my uncle's barber shop
just cutting hair everyday wearing mask and
that was what I was doing ah nothing much lah
I I was just trying to get along earn money lah you know ya
ya
oh okay okay okay ya the first the very first um
ya the very first lockdown ya phase one lah phase one circuit breaker was
was ya lah it's a bit a bit um
a bit stressful lah stressful situation you cannot go out then you cannot do this cannot do that then
oh circuit breaker itself ya
ya
ya the first few days ya I I felt like like
I felt I felt angry actually I felt like
I felt I felt like ah I I don't care lah I will still go out lah I will still do the normal things I will still go out and buy food and all that lah I will still
ya but after awhile then
it got more serious then I realise it's actually
a very serious thing lah then I I
accept the fact that it's a very serious thing lah so it's not like
just go out you know like
um
ya so I in the end I followed the rules also lah
ya
weird lah you never see never see singapore suddenly
like empty empty empty streets like suddenly um
hmm
mm
ya mm definitely different
different time lah you know err nobody
nobody expected this to happen lah so so everybody
a lot of a lot of people was stressed lah that time they a lot of people stressed err a lot of uh
domestic violence suddenly at home inside homes like
usually the man the man will get angry lah then
because ya
so
ya no work ya ya correct mm
so a lot of people were stressed right now also I think
I think if you if you see on the streets actually actually a lot of people
don't have jobs eh actually if you see like in like let's say
like today I went to like tampines interchange like my house is like
two bus stops away from tampines interchange right so
like today I like almost everyday like go school I see a lot of like um
like old people you know like they they don't have jobs but they trying
to make ends meet like they they collect
err cardboard boxes or they collect tin cans all that
then sometimes you see you feel quite
like
you know a lot of people are going through like a lot uh like harder
times lah a lot of people going through like more hardship lah you know that
if you think you are like
quite sometimes I feel quite um
I just feel quite sad lah sometimes when I see all this lah ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya
forced lah forced to
forced to stop working and
my mother will say something my my father will say something you know like a lot of people
ya but anyway like um
mm
mmhmm
wherever lah
five thousand a month like that right they suddenly they got no money then
there's a lot of them do catering business ah catering business they do sell
ya then it's not only that lah uh basically the music business
right now is definitely
everything have stopped lah then no cannot get money lah music business
so the next thing that
err like coming up and surviving is actually video video companies lah video
I mean um
right now video is doing
more important lah video is doing well lah like ya um
I mean although like audio and video goes together together to make a err uh to make a content right so
are out there lah there are more video jobs than than audio jobs so
oh I if had taken a video err course or what then
mm
is like lessons from home all zoom zoom lessons from home right so
like what am I going to do since next time like if if the if this thing continue then
ya itu lah funny times lah right now it's the funny funny times
ya
oh okay okay ya ya ya
oh ya ah
ya ah
mm
be part of this movement lah
oh ya ya ya okay okay
they put on netflix already like all the jack neo movies all the
old uh like money no enough like um
I not stupid and all that like ah boys to men
all the old movies ah mee pok man twelve storeys
oh is it
phua chu kang um under one roof everything is on netflix ah right now then I was like
ya so like lately I mean err you know there was um there was um
singapore music scene where you know all the like sony rivals the band like they have
their songs on like movie soundtracks like like twelves storeys ah mee pok man all that right then
ya so I finally get to watch all those movies lah ya I ah that's what I've been doing lah all the nights actually
ya catch up on my on all all the old things that I've missed last time like like uh when
during the nineties era what happened right like music scenes in singapore
so through movies lah then I I I I I watch lah that's that's what I've been catching up on lah actually ya
ya

okay ah okay
okay
mm mm mm
okay okay
okay
okay lah full name mohammad haikal bin hasani can just call me haikal lah so err
actually what what I had planned for this year was
okay
I was in the I was doing err project management in their construction line lah
ah
yes
they get back to me
like within a few weeks
it was quite a quick quick response lah
and the
ah ya ya ya ya
back then was was much simpler times lah so
then err
err when I started
when I just got the job like six months into the job
it was just a job for me
uh it's just a job for me to pay the bills lah
and ah just to
to to to earn to earn money lah
most of them they further their studies
ah
dig dig dig dig about it
I was like okay ah just go go go ahead with it
doing project management then might as well just get a
a a degree uh which
is related to my work lah so err maybe err err few years down the road err
down my career path lah in in my in my company at that time
so I I took up my
ya go ahead
oh okay err I was from poly I I went to singapore poly I took up uh civil engineering ya ah
err
it it it
err
it's related lah but
uh not I I my my scope
of work was not really into the err engineering aspect ah it's more to the project management side
it was just like ah
ya
so ah
ya I I can't relate I can relate
to do what you are you are facing right now lah
even before during my poly I went for my err internship
so it was during my internship that that made me err think twice to to join the construction industry
err it was
in a way I would say more of
a bad experience what I went through
ah
the working hours the nature of the work uh the work environment
err err ya
err
just sharing my my my experiences lah
okay okay mm
ya they attach me to a local construction company
err so
ya I mean I think it's it's the same for all industries lah or you can see a big difference between a local company and err err foreign or multinational company lah
I err in terms of budget in terms of work environment and all that lah so I was attached to a local construction company lah
ah the the project I was attached to they were doing a
a ah
a
everyone in the office was so busy with their work
acknowledge
in their office ya that was that was how I felt lah
it's a it's a foreigner I think ah he he's an indian guy
and because you can speak well so they they they they put him as an office boy
ah
so ah
he was the first guy who acknowledged me
ah
abeh ah
the project manager err then the project manager
on that day on that day ah
uh I think every every everywhere you work lah every month they will have a progress meeting ah
so the
so
ah okay for now you
you just follow my engineer
these big drawings construction drawings
err the size
this ah project lah
so
that that repeated for maybe two or three days ah
who who was was I was supposed to
to follow
so okay lah and then
he literally
ya ya I am ah
ya err
I'm I'm the I'm engineer but not for this project my upcoming project haven't start yet
ah so ya
the only
err the higher up
once a month ah just for the meeting ah just for the progress meeting mm
ah ya ya
so ya then err that that was it lah
it's like maybe err five five workers five staff or five to six ah mm
he's from uh
ya
ah ah ah
so ah and ah this ah
organisation he he he is a student from this err organisation ah
err
err the the students from china during the err
try try to
err like err
mm
uh
what um what's the
ah ya ya ya ah
err err like
ah language barrier and
err in in his own world lah
err err
ah ya office hours ah
stay back at work sia
then
only then you understand
what he meant ah which is true ah which is true ah ah ya ya
this industry like this is the work environment that I'm gonna be in
err
err wasted kan
err in this industry just just to just to have a job ah just to have a job and just help out help out the
uh pay the bills have part of the family ya which I which I did lah then
err
this thing
there were also doubt in my mind lah
for all the new stuff so okay go for the induction course get to meet all the new staff of course you all the staff are all are of different ages ah it's not it's it's no longer
err that time was like what
early twenties lah kan early twenties
then you literally work your way up ah
but at that point
didn't didn't thought had that in mind lah
ya so
err
ah like
and it also ah
you need to have some technical knowledge lah which I was lacking ah
err with the engineering the in terms of engineering aspect
I was lacking ah
so but we were my nature of work
was more into project management
which is actually
project management is quite
broad ah
like this all kind of all industries in a way they have
project management in a way it's just different different areas lah
so
ah
oh okay
mm ya ya
so ya err
my nature of work also we we deal with consultants
ah consultants usually they provide the technical err aspect ah
so err when when when whenever you
ya it turns out it didn't turn out
quite that bad also so ya I mean you just make do with what you
what I
what was more on the soft skills
but
ah when the work requires me to I can now I can I can do it lah
ah
a a
a degree lah then I took up a degree in building and project management
I took up a part-time degree
err previously was unisim now they call it ah
ya so
then you decided not to
okay ah
good for you lah good for you I mean
ah ya so
I took up
err my part-time degree
oh everyones
at that time ya like
really take up a degree in what really interest you ah
mm mm
ya
in the industry because your industry uh
is more on your portfolio
on the works ya is on the work that you do
so ya you don't really need a a a degree
uh with the the the
bosses like
doing this long term
like ah so like
uh we are a big
and then they got their directors lah and then they got their assistant director they got this and that they got a lot of hierarchy ah
like sometimes the conflict like
if you are you are holding a high
position you are literally ah living a comfortable life ah
it was
in my last year of my degree then I decided to
to
under production ah
under it's under ah
took up a media degree ya then for me to
transition into the media industry which is
I mean because
as you grow older time kau akan rasa time is like you you will feel the time pressure lah
like you are running out of time ah so
we'll just go ahead go ahead with just took up a media degree ya
we are are we
pick up another three years of study
at that time was
was so was want to
ah there's this
err
it's called a ah
and then the new zealand err working holiday is is a visa lah basically it's a visa called working holiday visa
err the visa is for six months
err
so they they use the foreigners as cheap labour so for us for new zealand the is is
uh is that horticulture industry lah
reservist dah approve
the more money I have can save up the more money
so this early this year when COVID everything happen eh like
only god knows what I was feeling ah at that time like
oh singapore at at first
ah ah at first
the new zealand government they
announce they close the borders
so like
for the first two months like that one
ah april ah
yes yes uh huh
at that time when when the the the
the news was was at at its height eh like
got diagnosed positive COVID positive ah and she was seated like ah three
three or four tables behind me which is
you have a lot of things planned already eh any like for everything to come crashing down eh it's really disappointing ah ah but
err at that time we just ah
ya but then err then
after that things happen

mm
mm normal
crazy as always
err
ah of course
what's new
just can't wait for my colleague to come back
then I can
back to her
too much
sue me or anything
it's true just stop then
like I just have to shut down and then restart
but yup and then
okay lah but I I manage
to like like go for good dinners um

I got like
ya and then um
and so wednesday I went Poulet and then thursday I went to
okay lah I mean I'm one of them lah but
it's true right
ya
I don't know I like the place because of that that water fountain thing
ya I just
ya and then I love the the the the atrium because
I can just blend and sway with them you know
just keep swaying just keep swaying
but it's closed now because of that christmas they have that christmas
display or something like you have to spend
thirty dollars to

yup
so I did spend thirty dollars just so that I could enter the atrium
and then end up not going to the atrium
it was on my A&W and err I I got a drink after that or
ya
like basically you just need to spend thirty dollars and then err they will allow two people to enter

it's just that ya I was a little scared that
I went over my weekly limits of going out

but no ya I always find they are
or at least my encounter with them the first time was that the giraffes were very cheeky

it's a privilege
they don't get a choice
they don't get a choice it's like something else is
doing he choice for them ya they can be anything and a lot of things but
they never ever get to choose
be something useful
apple tree providing apples to the world

eh actually no lah twenty one I was already doing theatre I already acting
I started at nineteen what
um after I was bored then I decided to sign up for all
then I said okay then nineteen years old I went to audition
I was doing backstage work
they need a dead body but actually that role right can just use a dummy you know actually can just use anything ah is just the thing doesn't move you know the dead body doesn't move
lie there then after that I say okay so um it was supposed to be someone else I was I wasn't even the actual human prop I replacing somebody
then that guy cannot make it so okay lah my job was just really to lie down I was preset you know so that means before the audience come in I was already prepared the covered me
and then somewhere in between like halfway in the
act
and um
then I can they can okay you can move now so I really have to stay still for like what two and half hours
I cannot sleep that's the thing you cannot sleep because if I sleep right I might snore I might move so it
you you try lah two and a half hours you do nothing two and a half hours you really don't
people thought very easy but actually is hard because
I had to learn how to I think I accidentally learned how to meditate
the inert potrayal of higgs my character got a name higgs because he died
watching the show and then um second day they tell me okay you can stand up for curtain call then when I stand up for curtain call already she was so shocked she was like astaghfirullahalazim she was like

no lah actually before before that happens
uh take over whoever's not here lah so I was just doing my job very well lah whoever I'll remember how they perform then I try to replicate exactly how they do it
so that was my first acting ah and then because of that I was confident to audition for young and wild for rice for
theatre artistic and theatre practice theatre practice was the first one first show that I ever did ah

I can see that my son really love drama so please ah then she then she just put our blurb that we give her at the bottom
like we like eh if you want to promote us and then you start to mentioning your other company for what right and then how is that and then
that post has influenced people to buy the programme also what okay we also don't know

okay
relax jer just just sound
no lah don't force it lah don't force it
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
alah that one
um
okay lah but
that's good you have a apparently early on already got path already
like for me also I keep switching switching
ah
okay but in the end I did become some sort of doctor
you want to be when you grow up then they cannot decide but it is just a fantasy thing lah I want to grow up I want to become
um
up so I was thinking like I wanted to become a dentist so that I can fix and then and then my teeth then after that I wanted to become doctor because I think I thought like
so then after that I'll be curious to do that so I have a very specific idea I remember I want to become a researcher with john hopkins to study lilac
then of course lah that
um
I was just study I was really focused on learning science but then
I don't know why eh oh I know why
I know that you know if I were late just go doctor get you know get excuse right and then I just have very good acting
no lah no lah no lah it was just one of the inkling thing but then I was at my school got err theatre studies and drama which I wasn't part of so I was always hanging out with them
planning to working towards becoming a doctor
but then it was stressful lah
and I wasn't doing very well in eh no in chemistry I think was
was it chemistry eh no physics physics and I wasn't doing very so well you know is it I like but I don't know why I didn't get A
uh attended this lah you know I do this workshop at then after that become an actor then slowly slowly
somebody I somebody asked me to replace them so all my job so far are because of replacement
like that ah so I always like the replacement then after that okay then they like okay lah give you more job ah then now I started learn
um
uh
like other skills lah like I've got to learn more about it
teaching then after now now I realised what is my purpose lah
mm
oh you went to watch that one ah ya it wasn't my first show lah but it was the first show that probably you watch
mmhmm
okay
mm mm
mm
ah ah
ya I mean I I love the show ah really I really help her but then
wah this I don't know whether I can say this I on record some more uh but ya got big issue lah that one until now some people are very traumatised by the experience but not the show itself but because of producing the show
ya so that like in a way I have to give advice lah it's really about you say lah your marketing
to win your audience um
the how whether they can the whether the audience can pay or not and stuff like that but then the thing is
mm then how you guys do it
mm
mm
let's try one of these prompts lah ha
mm
okay
okay
they always sell the masala chai in um
very tiny cups but I think is less than ten cents if you think about it in singapore dollar in dollars
the chai but in that cup the big cup huh can I I say ya ya ya
I I don't know I'm just addicted to tea lah so but I like ah masala chai ah you like tea right
um
chai basically is tea what
delivery alamak
okay
is it still continue it's not it's not uh okay
maybe
one food
and meets all so all the health requirements something like the vegetable
err
something with protein and carbs enough all
I mean if it's for survival
if your if your if I think about if you think is probably for survival lah but if I for indulgence
what would be the worst buy one get
huh what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
I just say for one is for one right buy one get one free
what would be the worst idea for that kind of sale
what about fringe
why would you need two fridge
buy one get one eh washing machine actually maybe one for whites one for coloured can make sense it can make sense
no lah but it's it's it's buy one get one free what
ah okay okay compare compare
okay okay okay
uh okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
mm if you can
master three new skills what would they be
then
oh
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
oh
on purpose
why ah
oh eh okay okay
oh
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
mm
mm
okay how important you think
that skills
nevermind scratch that question okay alright so for me if one skill uh I want uh
um
I think martial arts is good
but if I try
I try not
but can avoid it I will lah ah
I did learn
I did I like one time I my friend taught me how to do one move ah
ya in in I I didn't really I don't really learn much at lectures but I learn a lot from
like one of the things one of my friends decided to okay let's go okay we were trying no he was shooting a a a
trying he was trying to make a a fighting movie ah a fighting film ah
cool lah but mm
and I don't like to fight ah
ya but then no lah I don't think
okay I also don't know
what three skills that I want to learn
I want to learn a lot of skills
I mean right now I'm learning counselling
eh you don't know
I'm learning counselling I I did a diploma
no lah just uh uh uh generic
um a lot of the but uh just basic ones lah very introduction to all the different therapies lah
it helps also for yourself for myself and for
to learn about others and then they need a person
non-violent communication
which is very hard for
to do here
I like this person overseas and want to stay what would be your answer be
okay so some people okay I
some people they said okay to how you respond to it depends whether you are asker or you are guesser
okay if you can like you said okay can lah you ask me a you ask I ask you a question can I can this person stay at your place for two weeks
then you say okay like I have space you stay lah two weeks right
but some people they might say that
eh
dare to ask me we're not even that close um you know
you know
um
we take that example is not a very good example lah like one uh like so so the point is in guessing right in guessing culture
when you ask a question right you you want
or you always ask a question knowing the answer will be yes before so you don't actually ask before you do the asking you make sure
you can you guess around that it's okay to ask and they will say if an a guesser right would think that this friend
um
the they should have guessed what kind of status that relationship is they should have guessed
that it's an inconvenience they should have guessed a lot of things stuff like that lah but then
in the end um
in asia singapore a lot of us are actually guessers
right we don't ask directly and even with us we are not open to
so I'm learning about that ah so it's very uh and I err so so non violent communication
there is one part of it which is about requesting
like you observe situation around you you understand the feelings you understand the needs of you and the and the people around you
then after you know what you need to ask to make a request
you clothes around ah you know it made me feel uh like
I I feel unappreciated of all or I I feel no I feel um
that
uh you feel lah
maybe you feel angry or maybe you feel unappreciated maybe you feel
all you have to that you you
your feelings were not considered that you will are the ones who have to keep on cleaning up after this guy right
and then what you need I need
I need
ya this person to also do their part to clean up the house so the request is I the request is that lah I
if you could pick up your own stuff
um
would you be doing it lah am I right
okay I'm not explaining very well lah okay but then the thing is
like if
an asker to ask that
maybe they can make make somebody plead and say okay lah you ask me then I can say yes I can say no lah
ya it's like a demand kan to me so it's always hard I was thinking like how ah how to
balance that out I try to figure it out lah
ya but won't
mm
sometimes your question is seen as a judgement
mm
mm
ya I see hard ah
okay come let's see what other prompts they can give us
um
but you are following your dreams kan
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
I don't know I just only last you kinda kinda nearby indonesia in canada africa you occurred under its eco guy causing like you do
so formal
who do you speak with usually
mm mm
that
that's not real lah it's not the code is not the what to say
mm mm
language
mm
mm mm
mm
oh no
recording interrupted
oh let's pause first oh shoot
okay lah it's fifty five minutes fifty six seconds
err nevermind let me ask her uh
oh no okay uh
let me ask
hi my recording got interrupted
at the fifty five
minute
fifty six seconds mark
okay let me settle
should be okay lah alright nevermind we just submit this one lah
oh stop stop stop

hmm three wishes right
I want to help the poor maybe uh I feel that err it is my destiny to help others I feel happy and enjoyment when I help others
then next uh the third wish I want to be I want to have the intelligent intelligent of a successful person
if this intelligent I can achieve anything overall if this three witches wishes I can achieve anything that I want
these my three wishes so what is your three wishes furqan
uh
my views on what your wishes are it's actually uh is very good from what I see you are a people person like err like to give back to the community I think its a its a genuine personality which a pupil can adore and I really respect them
so let's say I want to go to orchard and I'm at tampines I can just go there in a blink of an eye I don't need to take transportation like err taxi car or any maybe motorcycle so I save a lot
I don't need to I save my time I save my money I don't need to interact with people I don't need to squeeze in the I will not be exposed to any kind of disease like for example COVID nineteen
so if everyone have these teleportation I think they spread of COVID nineteen will be reduced so I think maybe maybe I would I would suggest the government to research on teleportation
I think teleportation is a is a is a good superpower
all the sanitisation had been done so every person once they reach to the location they do okay let's say uh for example I I share an example ah
to my home then after that
I can so the next person go before the next person teleport the giant staff can claim that area or maybe food uh food court I teleport to the place
then after that uh I eat then I back home teleport back home from there I think this it reduces the amount of exposure to others don't you think so what are your views
yes okay err you said it can increase because the person uh didn't know that they have this disease and they teleport to a location and increases the chance correct
so err let's say you are not talking about teleportation you you are talking about err going to work
I don't know that I have this disease I don't know that I have COVID nineteen I have been infected with COVID nineteen and then I am going to work
okay I'm going to work I took a bus I took an I took I took a bus and uh maybe I have a fifteen minute walk from to my office
then I reach office to my office okay so I am exposing my disease from my house to office so there's buses there's
there's uh maybe uh the walking distance and the office itself so my destination
I I'm I am exposing my disease during my destination during my my destination to work
we only expose to the office
ah which is easier to contact tourists
it is uh something
err
interesting
let me give a give you a twist what if every time you regenerate it reduces your lifetime by one day would you still think that this superpower you is this superpower you want to possess
I agree to a certain extent where it can be good it can be good to you know err be alone at times
to just think or reflect on yourself and how to improve yourself in the future but to you know isolate one self okay how how long do you want to isolate yourself
err I think not exposing to the community
can affects this is this my opinion can affect one err mental health
I think K maybe if you will say one two days of uh being alone just to reflect on yourself
I think that will be good because it is it is quite tiring to communicate everytime with people to meet people to maybe uh act like as if you are happy like an act as if you are doing well with others
so I think it can be tiring but err
not exposing to them can be quite how should I say it uh
I can't put the feeling into words
I feel that err you need to expose yourself to the community quite frequently maybe to understand them I feel that we are being born in this world with the people around us
we have to communicate with them we have a purpose we have a purpose we have a role we have a role in the community every single one every single person in this world have a role in this community so there's no such thing as new rules this what I believe
just that whether do you want to fulfil their role
or not or do you just want to uh ignore this role or some people call it destiny
we have our own destiny we have our own purpose in life
we just have to find it so maybe with that isolation you can have that err you can gain or maybe you can decide what your destiny will be then I think we feel I I feel is good but if
to isolate one for for maybe months I question that actually I'm not sure whether it's a good thing for the mental health
okay so means err if a person is a father
okay so err what you trying to say that he should not isolate himself yet okay let's say that he he had he's a father of uh two kids maybe one is two years old and the other one is maybe five
are not fully grown yet so would you think that this man uh should isolate himself
for months
I feel uh I I agree to a certain extent err where
let's say this person have uh no responsibility maybe uh no parents no siblings no children no wives then uh I think it is okay I guess to isolate himself
but not too long because okay let's say err okay maybe one or two month is not so bad I guess but maybe more than that
the world is changing the world is changing every second I phone is coming up new phone every year so technology and everything else in this world
is is changing quite is is changing pretty fast so if he isolate himself for too long he will be how should I say outdated
like okay for example uh a person who went into jail okay it is some sort kind of isolating just that maybe he have maybe a few cell members
actually err pretty similar ah on on the investment part because err actually investment is quite is quite interesting actually you can evolves err a lot
I wanted to turn myself my own self to start investing but
at ten years old how much money do I have at ten years old do I really want to think about graphs statistics
I questioned it
err
if you were to tell me that investment is uh is a it brings benefits to a ten-year-old I don't really think so
but I mean it it is good it is I mean you can you can grow your money but I think I prefer
to not do it when I was ten when I am ten
I changed my mind maybe
I'll tell my old self to just enjoy life
just do what he wants like like you said you know maybe err last time I was maybe too good ah I'm too good for ten-year-old
so maybe I will tell myself to just being naughty because it is good to be naughty then
then now now I'm twenty four years old I should not be naughty already I'm a full grown man so
ten-year-old it is kind of acceptable to be naughty
it is acceptable for the society err when they see oh a ten-year-old boy is a naughty okay never mind you just let it be he is just a boy that's what the society thinks
if now I'm doing what a ten-year-old boy doing they will think I'm crazy
so maybe I will just tell my old self to just have fun not to think so much err about monetary err maybe maybe on investment but maybe I will tell my mum about it
when I go to when I when I meet my old err ten-year-old self I would tell my tell tell my ten-year-old self to tell my mum on investing
on investments maybe that will help along the way maybe I can enjoy life more maybe because my mum have a have more uh gains from the investment
and because of what I said to her she might give this uh money to me a bit so like I enjoy more on life I can go travel
I can go uh anywhere that I want because err there's a certain level of err financial freedom I would say
second topic
oh my my memory memory is err degrading
I lost my memory already I can't even remember what I said
oh I admit uh do you have you heard of uh about the time capsule
time capsule is actually a video where you record yourself okay let's say you are ten years old you record yourself conversing
okay then the the following ten years you reply to your old ten-year-old do you understand what I trying to say
I see the one that you said was the original time capsule where people keep uh items
or uh photos ah to then err to keep in a secret place or maybe err some people put it in a bank even
like for me I did some video err it's like a conversation with uh my old my my oldest self so let's say err my old self will ask some question
maybe my ten year old self will ask some question then met twenty-year-old self we answer the question
so it is actually quite interesting but I'm still waiting for I I did it actually err when I was I think eighteen eighteen or nineteen so actually I'm still waiting for maybe
eight years or seven years to make another video so uh I just hope I don't lose the video lah actually I don't even remember where is it now
hmm I like to be famous yes
but
but uh I think is uh if I were to take myself a picture of myself err every month I think I would forget to do that easily
so I'll consider it I'll consider it
one of the nicer waters in uh asia that uh that is cheap you can go is affordable so I went there as a as a basic err trainee
or open water diver course I went I went for a course open water diver course
so err I think there is err what what I faced was I forgot to breathe
so I thought I was suffocating I was diving normally was diving I was enjoying the the views of fishes and suddenly I forgot to breathe and I was panicking because naturally we breathe through our nose right
but scuba diving you have you have to breathe through your mouth so that that period of time that short period of time
I think I forgot to breathe and it's kind of uh funny where
I was breathing normally for maybe five to ten minutes then the next thing you know I am so called so called suffocating
so because of that err short forget to to breathe I think there's one of the near death experience that I faced then uh another err much more serious err
uh experience that I faced is a so called a near miss I would say a near miss
where it makes me err makes me err
then err maybe it was at the I can't really remember it was uh I think five six years ago so it was at the I think one of the junction near expo
so I was driving at the orchid street at a normal speed when suddenly there is a car that err jam brake
I see I see actually he was swerving he was swerving whether to uh go into uh into the filter lane or
or to the main road or to the main lane but then swerving between these two lanes so I was I was quite confused on what is he trying to do so when he swerved back to the main lane and the traffic light changes from amber
from green to amber so I thought he will still go to we will still proceed with amber light on but then err
he didn't so as a singaporean I will sit when I see an amber I'll press the accelerator
so that's where an accident happen and I
was lucky that I was wearing a seatbelt usually I don't really wear seatbelt because I feel that err it is unnecessary initially when this thing happen
I was relieved that I was wearing a seatbelt because if I didn't wear a seatbelt I'll fly out of my lorry and
may might I might even cause a fatal accident so that's my experience actually err and even err just now I was riding a bike
err due to my negligence I almost caused an accident where I thought it was a one way lane
but then it was a two way lane so uh I was riding at the opposite side of the road luckily
uh
I agree on that point where the accident happens when
err someone is err or or a road user is rushing
because when one person is rushing like for example we can see a lot of err delivery riders who is uh riding very recklessly around uh uh on the road ah because they are
err chasing chasing for the number of orders
or maybe uh road uh sorry uh lorry drivers lorry drivers
err less trip
people tend to rush doing things or or is it or or getting from one destination to another
and these are the things that can cause accident actually and I agree I agree on that it causes some negligence because err err when you ride fast or drive fast your ration needs to be fast too
and not everybody can do that constantly like for example err if you have been driving for long hours and you are you cannot you cannot
drive or ride at the same speed as when you start
your your work
you are you are you you when you start your day because you are you are tired so your reaction will slower so I think
it is always good to to be consistent in not rushing
for things maybe we can err plan up our day better or maybe have some realistic goals in in delivering uh maybe delivering food or having the number a number of trips all realistically depending on the day and time
so maybe with that err we are not so err I would say we don't we don't rush so much so when we don't rush so much we are more courteous on the road
okay if I give you some or maybe uh three hobbies one is err maybe ten years ago ten years ago something that I will start err ten years ago something I will start maybe soccer
err I would know I'm I'm not really a good uh soccer player or I can't really play soccer that well maybe because err I didn't play or I didn't play soccer that much
ten years ago and now I realise that uh soccer actually connects people
especially when you're good it really connects people from different backgrounds it is quite interesting to me err easily when whenever err people especially uh in in in work
they have a maybe gathering outside we said oh let's play soccer outside
uh this way you gain uh relationship or some
relationship ya I would say relationship it increase or strengthen the relationship between between few people so I guess soccer would be one if I were to start ten years ago
and err in the near future maybe I want to try rock climbing rock climbing and bouldering
rock climbing and bouldering seems err I think is is is quite interesting
err
because I because my my my social media friends are always pull some err activities that they they done
in their insta story so it kind of interests me I'm not sure uh how would I do but it is really something that I want to try
in the future what hobby that I want to try is golf because err in the future I see myself as a rich person and golf is a rich man game
so because golf from what I know is is one of the way to close on deals like business deals err so
they they use golf as an activity to make it less err how should I say formal
less formal so it is it is I think uh as a business man I think is quite important to know how to play golf well then how about you
err
so far I think eh all the err hobby or ambition are very subjective so I see where you're coming from err we are kind of uh similar in a way we like to do adventurous things so I think we are brothers

okay
hi what's up anna
ya so long ah now COVID nineteen very hard to meet sia
why you laugh
aiya now I working at bedok polyclinic ah I do the registration the patient then a lot a lot of patients ah so
ya that's my job lor then I like
err work err from monday to friday lah ya
then how about you
oo
ya tell me figures ah so that I know that my job this err
okay lah per hour babe
mmhmm
walao I eight dollar fifty only eh then got some more
he came to me ah then he he ask me err err wait
what do I do what do I do if I miss my number then I say
I already put your basket already why you sit down later you will be served then he say
no no no is my english very bad that you don't understand why is the
counter fourteen is empty why is nobody there is it
alamak then you know my my senior was like
keep silent then I keep quiet I keep quiet because she's my senior mah so I keep quiet lah okay I keep quiet
then after that he say hello why nobody answering my question then me and my
me and my friend was like err then we just went back to the our back uh
ya ya we straight up ignored him because like we don't want to
how to say like make it more I don't know how to say the tension like you know
like build up the tension or what kan so we just
so we just waited until like someone call him the another counter to call him and serve him lah
ah actually confront him because I was almost on my like
like you know then I'm like ah ya lah that's what happened ah that's one of it ah
mm
ya they think they think they old they
they we they think we need to serve them and everything but actually there's more uh actually oh my god
will think that oh I wait for mm
hello ah um sorry I wait for one hour um
it is one hour the waiting time because it's a lot of patients not just you
correct right ya so ya some of them don't understand you know
ya lah which is which is expected lah but that's like one of the few incidents lah it's it's normal you know but like as someone who is a youngster
like to see a lot of err older people everyday
less younger people of the same age it's a bit like and they see you as a
kid ah then I can get my ways sometimes they're like that so sometimes we have to stand our ground lah ya so you know
singaporeans like very kiasu and very like you know
ha they wah new iphone new iphone ah they can what
so like I'm quite interested in like how you handle the like
your workplace ya like are they okay they're they're okay right
quite chill lah all okay lah okay lah
ya lah ya lah ya
smooth ah smooth ah gucci ah gucci
I don't know I I've been thinking about it cause like
me my course my course is mm media production and design kan
if I'm wrong lah so
mm like designer
like magazine magazine you know lah whatever lah ya so anything advertising really so
like publicity or whatever it's just that I need to find which also
like which company that I want to go to because I think I
I you know a lot of people now want experience you know so
I don't know I've been thinking about it lah like
like just stop like just stop and then like
basically our progress
of like uh err gaining skills like I don't know how to say like
to intern like ya
got got intern but my intern is
was in the healthcare side at so it is related to my course
for their events so like it's relevant but the
setting of work or the target audience is not really like
not not that it's not cup of tea it's a good experience
I want to be more fun more young but
at there I'm just stuck with the older audience again and it's more about
what works what works ya I but I
okay lah I do give them quite good things but I'm limited by the fact that it's
the target audience is older so some colour I can't use they'll be more sensitive some font size ya because
if and I feel like a lot of info is inside err like a hospital kan nothing there already
there's bound to be a lot of info lah words so having a lot of bigger fonts
extravagant you know seh I think so so I feel like if I were to be
at somewhere that is more
for for employers also to even hire people now because they lack of you know money to even you know have manpower so right now I don't think it's a very good time to find jobs that
damn sad ah ha we never graduate
exactly
exactly
ya
yes correct correct
can we do you know like because it's not even a good time to think about career at the moment because like your career right now
err they they're all lah whatever uh whatever um like you say food business you you study
cause cause you know a lot of people don't dine can't dine that much all takeaway so it's harder lah basically ya so right now
ya lah like moving forward like right now I don't know what to do lah I feel like I don't now how to say I feel like we shouldn't
err to be so fixated with
do not think so far because I feel like if you think so far you don't think that these kind of things will happen I feel like you should just plan at the things that is
ya lah kan so so I I
oh my god yes oh my god yes yes I feel like I've lost my youth
fun things to do but we can't actually do it because our like I don't know going concert or uh like
oh
you can say relationships are affected in the sense like that I feel lonely I feel lonely
want to see but the like last time the how to say the level of interaction that we have last time and now is so different it affects us
mentally lah ya and I've been seeing all those tweets and everything people are really sad and everything I think largely
is a factor because people don't get to meet people I think that's the most important thing lah like you know like entertainment wise
oh ya correct correct correct
ya
ya
ya
correct correct correct are you an extrovert
mm
mm
how how how
oh
can who say cannot ya I changed also I changed also from extroverted now I'm okay I'm actually no I'm always actually when I took the test
but now is more now since last time I'm ambivert kan but now is more introverted
mm
the thing is ya ya
yes correct correct correct
correct
ya but it has become draining ah but ya sometimes ya it gets draining
correct correct ya correct correct
can relate lah like you have a lot of friends but you just want to hang out with just five of them lah like that like you just don't want to hang out with them you know
I think it affects us ah like if we ever like once the COVID nineteen is done or whatever I think it will be hard to adapt back to how we were you know
ya ya
ya lah
mm I'm just I don't know I feel like okay
so since uh we talk about this COVID nineteen thing eh I feel like I don't know I'm recently very like
upset about the worldly issue that has been going going like black man and everything right
ya ya me too
correct correct what might happen ya I ya but like err
there's a lot of like bombings also um in gaza and everything so it just makes makes how to say ah it's more we get
ya we we don't see it you know
like I feel like now singaporeans start to realise how privileged they are because like we don't have such problems we do have problems
but I'm also quite glad that
I don't know because we have the general election thing and everything so I feel like I think
to talk about sensitive issue minorities and everything so I feel like I hope that
once once the COVID is over or what there will be more err faster I don't know
basically be more open to such issues instead of oh being
close minded that kind of thing just because the government doesn't talk about it but now I realise oh actually
wow we are like ya sia we think we think singaporeans we're like smart and everything but no seh I think
I think I realise that a lot of us like as a nation we lack empathy to
ya to such matters ah
yes correct
older generation ya
mindset ya
ya
yes correct correct correct
especially like you said the older generation they don't agree a lot to our
younger people people's view or or take on on how it should be or what because they think they're like
older and everything but I think it's because they're too ingrained like their traditional values is too
ya
I I I I'm quite
I'm quite glad ah like you know cause like
err I like I have faith lah
for like this
will be a better country for the people lah not just for economic
like it has a certain
image that it wants to capture like how it's very
green eco green very luxurious expensive but
we have a lot of
what is it called
flaws ah
that we ya but ya lah I just hope that things change lah
ya so right now what's important right now is I'm hungry
like just now I eat what did I eat just now let me think
err what did I eat ah oh I eat fatty bom bom
but is a new the new outlet at uh east

ya it's uh eight to five it's not a shift
there's one hour break lah
but like but like I have a ten minutes before if I
if we bring bread or what you can eat at that point of time or buy something
but the thing is I want to buy but I've to wake up early and you know me
mcgriddle
ya but I've been wanting to buy it just now but then I was
like shit it's too early and then I was like shit but I I miss I
like other timing kan like it's not always like a constant err
fixed menu right why ah why they do that ah what
oh oh ah I like heavy because if I eat light I will shit
and then okay basically ah I don't know maybe got something wrong with me ah
but the thing is if I eat something heavy or what it will be okay I don't know what's wrong with me but like
I think they have the plain one the plain one is my
okay so
uh huh now I hungry sia shit
okay so
what time did we came here ah
eight
no like in this
contraption
okay okay so I'm eighteen
ya we met in poly
cause mm
interest group ah
ya
okay ah okay ah okay
okay it's okay don't worry don't worry okay
where do we where do I start
okay so okay I
springfield secondary
ya so I
oh you didn't know oh okay
ya so I started with sports okay but I bored of it anyway ya floorball then ah ya
four years ah
yes correct from sec one
C division I think we got second then B division we got second
I I I became the captain I think
ya it was like shocking because
okay
I'm like quite a perfectionist
so last time uh I'm not good at floorball but there were like
so I thought that maybe this is the chance to learn a new sport
so you know what I did
okay basically I didn't have the stick and everything I didn't have the funds
then ya I I I
it's the not the wooden one it's the screw-able
that one ya I took it out then I use hanger the steel hanger
to form the shape of the blade
ya then after that I wrap it in wrap the blade
in in tape
as thick as possible then I attach it to the ya to the
I I practise at home I did once bring it at school but uh
ah but if I don't remember but I showed them okay maybe not maybe not
at all because it's circle it's very thick and everything
like it was swollen
ya
ya because it's the training stick ah the not so good one but training stick
ah I bought lah using but that's when they they told me you can buy using ah what is it called ah last time
medisave eh medisave no medisave edusave medisave edusave edusave aiyo ah
education whatever thing lah then like
ya lah then I once I bought the stick I practise almost everyday
I flunk my grades literally
because I practise every day I stay back at school ya I prioritise that uh because I
everytime I try to shoot kan the ball will always roll on the floor
it's there's a there's a boy and a girl but we don't mix the trainings ah unless the stupid teacher wants ah
but that's err that's another story lah but like
ya so I train train train train train
and then I I think my teacher noticed or something like that
then I think that's why I became the floorball captain or some shit like that
ya because I trained on my own timing that kind of thing
and I actually got better I actually got better
ya but I failed my grades lor but
it's okay lah I got to be the captain lah so once I did
I
I don't know felt nice but I felt unrecognised
so okay for me I find I'm ugly ah
I'm ugly back then ah honestly ah among the girls and most of the pretty girls already
know how to play floorball
so people expected that they would be one of the ones that will get the position lah
so when I got it because I was really an outcast
not they don't dislike me but I felt
a certain of like acceptance
no acceptance because because me and my friend one side only
to do all thing but once I got to be the captain or announced as the captain
they started like asking me like to join them and everything but I also ask my friend
who were outcasted to join me ah that's how the the team bond ah
ya but then my secondary school like quite dramatic also ah I'm sure your one also dramatic right
oh
oh okay
you you involved
oh
I'm okay with you
oh
okay I'm quite
quite surprising seh to find out that your most drama life was in poly
class drama okay I think
mm
that's good lah because for me I'm involved in it because of the people I know
the floorball drama is I'm not involved in it but it's just that you know
there's a lot of rumours about very petty lah just about girls being pretty then
they date date they date date date date and everything
yes so
so I'm not involved in in it anyway it's just like that kind of thing but I also do
stay away lah from them but then if you want to get the team together you kind of have to
kind of get on their good side so that they can listen to you that kind of thing so
but it went well lah because we're the most bonded
team ah because we didn't like the seniors the seniors very stuck up
they think they're good and everything but we got the most achievements
so we're like leh we're a better batch
ya we were the junior team
and we brought a lot of medals ah
ya so
secondary school was fun and everything then I like failed math then I'm like
okay so what's next so
so I go and do then after that oh I oh design don't need math
uh my science also but it was a D seven I think it's a pass but my math was the one ah
but then I was I chose a design school so it didn't matter that much I guess
my language was okay
so now ah that's how I got into ford lor
ya
that's what I was thinking cause
uh I heard a lot about like drama
uh huh floorball specifically
so actually I was quite burnt out being the captain and
err I don't know just very tiring so for me to go there
and continue it and imagine like it's far it's far then training
that's man I was like
time for a switch up let's go volunteering
in smart asia lah
cause ah my friend also lah cause her friend is in
is the vice president but eh president so she asked me to join the team
and I also wanted to do something
volunteering because I wanted to add on also to my to my
life skill and resume or something like that lah so
I damn burnt out by sports it's I'm bored of it lah basically
how to say ah I actually I love sport
but it took a toll on me because
I had to buy the equipment and and and I'm not so well off too at that point of time to buy
ya it's like a burden ah for my parents to keep buying me shoes and all so I
think
I could come back to it if I want to because
after my secondary school right I actually join external club
ya I actually joined eh few seasons and all but the trainings were right after school and like
so that made me like wah another commitment
but it was already after um
oh haven't it was O-level I forgot then I quit then I quit then I quit then I quit then after that
they asked to come back again that's why I was like no I no to the club
it's um I just feel like I have the passion for it but
it's not what I want to do in the end so
maybe not my passion ah but you get what I mean I don't know me as a person I like to try everything and I want to do
good in everything and that's me lah but that's the thing lah I can't focus on one thing lah
right now it's not I think it's becoming popular
so
it's becoming popular because we're good at it I think now ya we're good at it we came in
the asia games we came in third or second that's not bad ah honestly
but national wise um don't know yet lah but I think not bad lah
not bad I think not bad ah honestly not bad ah
ya but if you if you were in it I think you will know the there's competition to watch
same like other lah
so ya lah I decided to do the volunteering thing then of course I met you lah that's how I met you lah
like
I don't know I was so nervous actually because like
it was such a weird
like
it's not weird lah it's like
it didn't feel like everybody was there for the same thing
it's like do you get what I mean I don't know how to say like some just join because this is the most chillest
kind of kind of thing but some join okay of course I want to help and everything
then
and then like
ya I didn't know you that much ah I think the only time I actually got to know you was during the camp
the smart asia camps right
ya
I thought I thought you I don't know eh I was kind of scared of you lah
I feel like you like a
legit legit legit legit but actually you're very friendly
not like not like you look lah but then you
have the vibes but you're quite smiley lah so
ya but then I also
not I also don't mind also
talk talk to other people so it's okay but then actually
didn't expect then
ya lah actually quite fun ah actually
smart asia was the most randomest
thing ever
quite a lot right
kan in fact
flower actually everything actually almost all
err you did the flowers for the mother's day
for the whose idea was the ignite one
there it's more than one idea we just added added added added added right
ya we we that's that's the best idea sia I don't know why sia
I feel like end up right
we'll always be the last ones to stay back and last ones to do the thing cause we're the organisers of the thing
correct correct
yes correct correct
but we're trying to
the worst I feel like the worst is the camp
because we didn't make our camp remember we made the dance night last minute
because nobody actually wanted to go it's only like five people seven people
then like wah damn sad eh
because I feel like
I don't know like I said I think
people were there for different reasons not particularly to commit to it ah
they just want to have a so like
oh there's actually point incentives to do let's join this one instead and get
point system or something like that
so ya lah I think it was fun lah
but it was like really the really feels like a like a amongst us kind of
like we're the cause we're a part of the EXCO mah then we're just like
let's okay let guys um we plan plan plan plan guys what do you think great great
it's just us deciding among each other you know that kind of thing ya
ya then I don't know
if you would rate your okay nevermind let me think properly
which is the best
experience of
tertiary education
no no no not okay education which stage
is the most ah ya ya ya which stage is the most exciting to you
mm meh
okay lah
happiest unproblematic yes
okay okay okay yes yes yes
okay
oh okay
yes oh my god
mmhmm
okay
okay
oh there's such thing ah okay I didn't know leh
oo
I was quite popular in various gorgeous for being like the top housekeeper like I don't know why but like our sports the there is like even and rope skipping sector where it
wow got vision this is a sport
mm
oh my god you so pro seh
while skipping
wow pro seh
mm
wow
uh huh uh huh uh huh
ya that's why mm
okay
wow
but
it's with music ah usually the competition
oh my gosh
ya
oo
oh
wait so so
oh okay
ya ya ya ya ya
uh huh
seh lah oh
oo okay
is it not your passion also
for fun lah mm
I I also only started dancing
ya but not good
I like free styling but I don't know they keep
every I know can do K-pop ah you know
I free style a lot but but at first I look stupid lah
ya I don't know why I found myself good at it later I show you lah the video
but don't judge don't judge me ah I I no training but like
ya so now so meaning
ya ya
okay
oh
it's like but fast and sync
ah you like the kind lah
ah
okay
mm
mm
it's so
oh
oh not bad ah
okay okay
if win win lah you lose ya
forte kind of thing
okay
oh okay
mm
oh so there's
oh shit
aiyo
mm okay
not supportive ah
oh
oh okay
oh okay
but you got you work a lot of you work ah ya lah
oh
mm mm
aiya
okay
but you made it though
ya ya
mm
that's quite interesting flow of experiences
primary
not really
mm
you did ah
my eh my also same
eh I kind of want to but I don't know what course
but the thing is I also don't know there is there is but the design is very specific
your what going to design very emotional design graphic graphic design
video video so I don't know what I exactly want
ya it can be also content design
or data I don't know lah a lot of stuff lah they want specialist specialist
I actually want to be a creative director
ya meaning
if there's a project visually I'm I I'm in charge
so let's say it's a photoshoot let's say it's a photoshoot
if I'm the creative director
the props is me the concept is me
that kind of thing ah so you can if you're a graphic designer
you can the it's more production
but if you start from designer also can because you already have the visually your own
own kind of taste and everything then you can put the element inside
production okay for example I'm trying to think of
a concept yes okay let's say creative creative creative director um
I'm the creative director of
so the show the art direction of the show the concept of the show
is up to me
can can be
can be small can be big ya can be small can be big um
it can be magazine creative director so can apply for a lot of stuff
so
but creative director is you need a lot of you need to know your shit lah basically
you need to like you worked with so many people you know so you need to be out a lot of
ya that kind of thing also can but just anything that makes it I don't know I feel like right now
I'm not stuck to one just just try everything see what I like the most
but I'm quite I like media it's just that media is
but I like I want to make my own films
cause in films you can make your own design also what technically
I have but it's only for personal videos ah
not not like a thing thing kan but I can do a lot it's just
you need nowadays you need to be different
like stand out I think so it's hard to have a brand basically to make a brand
but it's okay lah should can lah basically but anyway I'm just saying like
wow I didn't know that you had that err roller coaster of jumping on
a lot of interests and it's very different from each other
ya cause I'm just like
oh that's how you get got into culinary I I'm quite like surprised
I can't believe that like what really everyone
ya what what would you do if it's not
actually you can seh I don't know I think you can eh no but you can eh
but still your design not bad
I think it's not bad it's just that you needed to develop it
but mm
develop which one ya cannot decide which is actually same problem problem with me I also don't know what to focus on
but then they say it's good to be good at everything
that kind of thing
master of none
okay I want to work as a
the end of the day but then not just grades you know but nowadays it's not really about grades so
you know what I mean
that's why
ya but I think nowadays
I don't know how to say adaptability
maybe I'm just being biased but adaptability I think ah poly student will adapt better than a student
which is unfair actually
like they say they say get experience get experience we have experience
oh sorry ah you don't have you don't have a university cert you don't have a cert so sorry ah sorry
then the other person will be like oh uh you're accepted then I'll be like huh why I wasn't accepted
oh the it's not the standard and everything and I'm like oh and they have a higher pay
just because you know unfair quite unfair quite unfair ah
quite unfair ah
the world is unfair but it's fine you know what they you know you know a great person once said
like is unfair so that it is fair to everyone
you know who who said that me
no lah no lah I I made it made it up myself
I think it has to be unfair for everyone so it will be unfair for all so it's like
correct correct
which is why I feel like
it's not fair to judge someone
uh like by how much they work
cause like they always say this
uh if you work hard enough you will get it actually not true eh it's all about chances and opportunities and connections
and that's I feel like the reality of it is true is
it will never be it I don't know ah but it will never be measured by how much you work
is it will always be measured by
it will be controlled by someone who has
the upper hand
that controls how much we work and all cause we will
like how to say you'll never escape
you will always be working under somebody
ya that's why like robot robot robotic
ya but like ya I feel like I don't think
I feel like being rich here I I could be a
that's like the same as me being a evil person
you know what I mean if I'm not fair lah if I'm not fair
labour it's like there's so many chains under
I think humans are the reason why
we don't do well we just
ya
correct
so it be forever like a cycle so humans humans eat other humans lah to survive
where it should be like
I got your back cause I'm a human also I wish people like
a bit more
section
no like more like basically understanding each other instead of
just
uh just see it as it is
like it's a bad thing oh it's a bad thing but there's more to a bad thing the bad thing could be like
oh the person didn't mean it it's by the own circumstances that made it like that you know I mean so
yes correct correct yes
ya
like I've always thought about it like
being good and being bad like
if you have the
capacity to be bad then you have the capacity to be good
if you have the capacity to be good you have the capacity to be bad
so not everyone is good not everyone is bad everyone is just human
kan you can't compare to anyone else because we don't know
we don't know everything ah basically
ya correct ya so we cannot like judge
but then judge is in our nature what

popeyes okay lah for popeyes

hmm
mmhmm
can we see him
we haven't seen each other for
long time
wedding eh
but do they have a
a great wedding
what's that
oh
who's that see
why
hello baby
oh
mm

okay hi azli yes and we both of us are um married couple
we are partners for our whole entire life as what we know and we wanted to talk about our marriage now
yes
ya so we are here to talk about our marriage so a few questions about one thing about you and me one is like do we have plan and preparation because for what I know that back then
we don't have plan yes I have plan that I want to get before
planning no don't have plannings so when you actually say I say oh automatically I said yes one so but for you right do you have a plan before you want to get married to me like ah because for what they know they say you must have the five Cs
uh condo credit card car and whatever the C lah but then
when I get married to you right I I really don't think about all those C
I just think let's get married
done
but okay so for you right that time do you have a plan or preparation like why you want to get married to me and or and do you have a plan like um like what you want to do when we get married
will be like oh no this one lah
he cannot I already mah so you say that you end up
so when that time when um it was my turn right um I wasn't really like preparing anything like do I need to prepare myself like um does he have a job or stuff like that because that time when you actually um proposed to me
you just graduated from poly because the things that our age is catching up ah that time we were already like twenty seven I think
because one thing for sure he is mature already he is someone that is mature to me he is someone that is mature like uh knows um a lot of things
a lot of things know in basic work and also it what he wants to do in life he know to but I think for planning something he still leave it up to me correct like for example when you went to get the house
ha decision like for example when you want to get a house I decided that we would we should get a house before we get married ah
because of the and the right that one all um we we prepare ourselves yes uh I'm more of a person who plans so that time even our our financial or our finance for our wedding things also
uh we all all our by ourself lah
okay
yes
the price was actually
because one thing is like um they say it in um
they they actually translate from malay to english through google correct so that's one of the reason why we don't want we don't want to take them ah then we tell them so many times also they don't want to listen so eventually at the end of the day we I I was so fed up I just
and then they cannot give me anything like that's it okay nevermind I guess
cancel ya call it a day
ya call it
so that time I think uh we we just say okay nevermind we actually spend hundred dollars eh I was about to fork out everything eh to tell them okay I pay you everything by today but then thank god I didn't eh I was actually thanks to
ya because I trust them so much
but then uh at the end of the day we eventually we do our own card
she was so not happy with my design you he actually do his own card and I do my own card
yes actually my card looks like a birthday party ya so they don't like it
no I my one is also my one also still the best
well actually my one finish because uh it's no longer I mean I got no more cards to give lah but that time
ah ya but no I don't want your one I don't like
anyways uh it actually works I print exactly lah that's why ah you got extra correct so that time
so uh eventually after that we that's not the only problem ah during our wedding ah actually my greatest fear for uh
quite popular in suria also and uh he's one of the funniest guy ah I was like
so happy that I got here eventually I feel I don't care anymore then eventually right on that two weeks before our wedding he back out alah
ya wasted sia it's like he asked us to go I mean find someone else then he said how much if you want us to pay I say no I don't want to I don't want to work with the the caterer anymore so that's why I want to back out then I was like walao not on my wedding lah sia
but before our wedding there was this uh issue about caterer not showing up and there's something like that then after that
the I the actually do it for fee but I contact then I contacted but not asking for free lah contacted asking for cheaper price or something cause I told him that my story and all that they gave me a good price
which is way better than that guy price and the eventually become better eh best eh until now some more still
feel on our facebook and then also uh still wish us and he is like one of the best I feel lah so shout out to azuri and then um
ya our our wedding take place azuri azur but uh the his name is azuri
okay
so ya okay so
is that they if the caterer doesn't show up actually the doesn't show up the
ya
is very much um
that guy is is is is cool that guy is good very very cheerful real funny guy err better than you that's better than our last time you and you are supposed to be there right
ya
okay so ya make it a drive all right so um is there any regrets
about the wedding not the marriage ah the wedding ah
oh ya the weather it was nice ah
mm
ya
one of the regret is that
if I know about orange ballroom
about the same as the point that we actually for our wedding also same
eh
ya
mm
ah
mm
ya so that was like one of the luckiest thing ah for you ah for me the luckiest will be the photo ah no no not the photography the photography was good ah the no ya
photo photo
yes correct the photo booth so photo booth
game what my friend did she's amazing ah that time she and her boyfriend she did was an she did was an amazing job
because that photo booth because of that photo booth right there's a lot of
cute funny and amazing pictures the pictures was
picture perfect amazing everyone love it everyone was so entertained by that picture and then
so once we got married marriage life happens
a lot of fights happens a lot of um crying and happiness
and travelling together happen you get to know I got to know
more about you
the the most tested
years of wedding of marriage is the five years
five years of marriage you you think about everything like financial
life work blah blah blah and stuff like it's true
kan ya so just to ask you again but um
we go through like a lot of stuff lah eventually until now even though it's
ya
the the thing about like being worried is more than worried like
like recently we we love anime
demon slayer was like one way of my
uh marvels uh
um some like fast and furious I don't like but you love fast and furious
is travelling kan
mm
ya
chey that was a punishment though
eh
I don't know eh oh I wasn't I wasn't given anger to to me ah I don't know why I wasn't angry usually I would be angry ah because to me this one is very very particular but after that event right that's where I very
ya of course that time I I know I found out that he actually
he likes driving also lah
no lah but then but
ya
you always say that next time but we won't we won't go anymore
so and then um like okay what is your regret is there any regrets for this marriage for me
like we do have financial issue
we have we don't have things that um we wanted to do lah
how we portray our wedding our marriage because
after I been I see people in instagram and then after that I see people in friends
real life and after that real events there I see
they do their own way marriage lah
ah so that's why lah
so what about you do you have any regrets
okay so um
can I just ask you another question ah before I I remember I just now I asked you one question ya the regret so do you have any regret of not married not marrying me lah
mm
eventually he is like one okay guy lah so okay lor okay last question
last question lah I want to ask you also you know this all interview about me ah
is there any what's your biggest fear about marriage not wedding ah marriage biggest fear for like for example
for me right my biggest fear will be if you cheating
because cheating right it goes to a lot of questions and curiosity uh I'm and confusing and blah blah blah but one thing I know if he cheat it's not my fault ah it's your fault but then um there's no such thing as tercheat ah
ter ter there's no such thing as that one for for what I know lah
but for me that is my biggest fear because I cannot live with the fact that if you do cheat on me lah
ya correct ah then about uh then another thing is that I'm also being I'm also very fortunate to have a very good mother-in-law and father-in-law in-laws so eventually my in-laws are good are good people ah that one
uh never give me stress also because like the thing is that um in-laws right
okay lah still got we we there was a bond there ha and now uh we have our own house we we took care of our own house we're happy and then
uh we want to create our own family here lah ha
so okay just just before we end all this finishing
is there any future um request
as a husband towards me for
let's say if you want anything that you expect for the next like ten twenty years okay let's say just ten years lah we are already in our
oh my god do I know this
okay I think uh because um for the last past five months eh five years I have been like driving you crazy kan okay the thing is that um
okay ah I for me for the next like about maybe around ten years before we reach that mark ten years mark I wish that we have
a a small family lah like another um junior
either junior girl or junior boy doesn't matter that uh another person ah in our family lah kan
yes because I want to be healthy by the time I'm
getting older you know I don't want to be like like sixty already and then cannot breathe already you know something like that
okay so um I'm be thankful for all these years of meeting you
and I'm very thankful that I actually get married and I actually uh know
about you more lah
because of the time lah if I got time of course I don't mind cooking also where is like parts of the marriage can say that because like other people need to eat but the thing is that uh to me
I like cooking lah not really into cleaning up ah he likes to clean up so he would assist me in the cleaning up ya kan
okay so um that's one thing I like about so that's all about my wedding and my marriage and my life so I'm very happy and I think that's about

ah uni at is that premium
so it's just a one year course so ya
ya
one year
ya just one year
one year and is only for like a forty K
forty K including the food and the house
ya ya but then weekly need to pay around like um eight hundred weekly ah for the rent yes yes ya correct
including ah including their school fees and stuff ya four thousand but it's actually okay ah
ya
ya so what are you gonna do like like stick in this job
are you thinking of upgrading yourself
oh ya how long how long you have you work
oo that's fast
are you planning to change to what industry
oh ya but now also not the time to change cause of COVID
ya correct
ya correct there's no job
oh ya ya a lot of people are looking into um childcare jobs
ya
ya correct you have to take the course
you can take part time I don't know if it's subsidised or something it is it
oh oh the or the swag yes correct correct oh
oh
worth it lah because it's for long term like for until you die what you hold that cert
oh the
P C or something is it uh huh oh you wait until you are twenty five day then you can get the
the work and learn shit I don't know ah what is it
uh okay then you can upgrade yourself what then
mmhmm
um
but what if they don't upgrade you you know now is not the time for promotion or
no increment lah
oh
admin you know admin actually
two point five thousand yes they earn a lot
they just sit office and book flights for the managers just simple admin stuff like or the food cause my
she don't travel along right no no she'd never travel
which admin which department
because depends on department like my friend is a admin for like err department admin
so like she's like the receptionist
so so like when you enter she's there
uh ya don't have the more so but then now she move on to a better job that job offers her two point seven now
register order nothing nothing about law cause it's just admin work like the you know
ya
yup
ya but nevermind you can just now like gain experience then you can go for senior admin ya correct
then people ya
ya I mean is very tough ah
what
okay new doctor is easy to handle because they don't do anything what you can like okay doctor okay doctor
why
uh huh
a'ah
okay but then okay lah working with new doctors they tend to depend on you which is better
whose fault is that is your fault what it's the doctor's what oh X-ray oh
I mean then you talk to the head X-ray department lah
so ya
I haven't send in my petition but I already got the form I mean I still have time
I haven't go buy thing during my holidays my next holiday is december then I can go banks but bank now the loan rate is very low because of their bad economy so these is good and a bad thing ah
now is like I'm like ah whatever just go lor because even if I go now there's no job maritime job for me
of course right now I think I'm like
whatever like just do it no because I just
ya that's life ya that's why ya correct correct
nothing is certain sia now like
mm correct
alright
ya I'm not ready to be no adulthood lah so I think I should study one more year
master
if because master in is also one year usually master takes like a lot of years like maybe three years if I'm not wrong I'm not sure
while uni in singapore is four years
um degree first their master then PhD uni is degree
then they way to continue ah if you got the money
ah if I got the money I guess or maybe I will work first and then I take my master part time
until PhD I don't know if
so ya lah so I'm after my career now so
cause there's nothing is certain lah
ah ya correct so
ya lah
ya like ya
correct
but hais such as life
mm
september then come back august I think
so fast yes correct
ya nine months
correct
then you will visit me what there
because I'll be having my own room
so it's like my friend one room me me one room so you can just sleep over I don't care like I mean the landlord won't know
I mean if you're going with your boyfriend then he can sleep in the living room
ya he can stay in the living room but you guys come during my term break ah I don't know
maybe mid of the year like maybe I think
february yes so maybe in the middle of jan september

ya ya ya ya ya
or you can just come
to me when I want to go back singapore what but then you come like one one week early
ya that one perfect ya
ya I think that ya

Airbnb where you get where you get comfy bay you get comfy pillow comfy
toilet comfy kitchen hall living room oh my god ah that is so nice and we don't have to go far lah we just
all we want is just maybe to go to our neighbouring country you know like malaysia
err I I'm not sure because I don't think they have like us safe entry or maybe trace together
and um I'm not sure whether it's compulsory for them to wear masks there
and then um
because johor has err strike up the numbers has strike up so and it's a red zone
so I don't know whether because err the last that I heard was that the our government will allow
both boarders to be opened only if johor um numbers demote back ah but I think after a week it does in its red zone
mm
ya I still have my dirt bike to go oh my god
ya it's on the date it was it's on the day that
err the government of malaysia actually wanted to close down the borders
I was like oh my god
I I paid two hundred sing dollars for the dirt bike you know
I didn't even get to go and I was like should I and and we were like should we go
we were like should we go home that night or should we go home the the the next morning
actually we wanted to just go for the dirt bike and book a train ticket at night so that we can go back to singapore
but then I think a colleague of mine her mum was quite worried that we don't even get to
err ya get on board and get back to singapore on time ya because it closes at twelve you see ya just say twelve so
I was texting I was texting the dirt bike organiser I was like hey I get this um news about your government closing down the borders blah blah so how how is it now then she says that okay

mm or their business may flop you see
ya I saw like um
the europe
country is new zealand and I don't know which other country allow the singapore is allow certain countries okay example one of it is our country lah singapore to actually go over there without having to um
isolate ourselves lah but then again you know if you were to come back to singapore you still have to abide our the ya the rule by isolating yourself for
two weeks

ah okay lah that's nonsense lah we all know that's nonsense you see
ya there are some like you know they are being hospitalised for a month or so like six months three months four months and some are in
so it's like if it were to be that easy I don't think any other countries will have second lockdown you know
that german is having a second lockdown europe is having second lockdown and then
um we are having this thing we call circuit circuit breaker for like two months after that phase one phase two and now when we want to open this phase three also government is thinking twice thinking twice whether to open and they have this pilot thing going on like you know you can go for clubbing but you still have to wear mask

julie also was like okay lah
that's what my mum was texting ah ya she's like that right you know right
and this is one of us
but how you want to justify it doesn't
false declarations no was dry
daddy bear
he wants the freedom
because
is it block leave or clear instructed
oh you got your zoom ward meeting
okay
what hospital
it was initially ya it stopped I could have done it I could have done it lah but then because tonight my wife works night shift so she's gonna go to work at roughly
no they got time limit so when you book your time right it's one hour when you book then you don't want to go always right waste time but I didn't but that time when I went was okay lah but it's a it's a service free
one room I mean I just bring my wife so we can still hang out with my friend ah yay do the what first ya

my guy I got one I think I I got one ah
british guy
he's from fulham fulham
salad singapore I want to do the salad
no oh my god he is he is kind of two left feet actually ya but that's the thing I feel like he's like he he okay like two left feet but then I think he plays soccer actually he he plays soccer so ah the thing is that they said he started coming like more often ever since circuit breaker I think like his normal amateur soccer games or whatever is like so common nowadays so that's why he every saturday will be there for training
so that's what I'm like telling my guy he said okay
ah supposedly there is lah but because it's been so long since that we we go no it's not that and
it's been so long that they there was a structured
way of doing things you know so it was very fragmented but this month woodlands so it was
it was quite fragmented especially after my dad passed away
because it was actually started back by my dad's friend and too bad lah ya
what
huh
hais can't change this two buttons around because control is actually on the left and I'm so used to not it being on the extreme left so my fingers are always here when actually it should be here
then
so that's where I learn photoshop lah but then like forget how to do photoshop
I used to do photography in schools
ya you will but I think like it's like so far it was like primary school ya forget it anyway I stop doing it when my friend passed away because we used to be partners together then he passed away in secondary school
and then after that because I I know the whole I know the whole family lah yeah because after that I I found out from my mum that actually
yup I forgot why the brother passed away but it's really sad ah then I only found out cause after he passed away then he contact no lah
only one only one one one of my girlfriends
yeah she was a good friend lah we've been friends now I think twenty odd years twenty one years
but now we we talk to each other lesser
ah I didn't really have a good reputation in school
yeah it doesn't really matter to me lah
I don't I don't I don't really care what people think about me
ya in a way I mean in a way like if you want to talk bad about me so be it lah I won't I won't lose sleep over it
ya
all going out for supper party not all all thank you
she can speak chinese what then trilingual
K bye swee ling
papa bear and aunty bear go for breakfast
so mama bear not in all the bears go out today
went already what just now ya he was in office
ya which you quite elated right because of how he looks
ya the company closed down what company is it ah huh
oh jamco
jamco I think
because that time one of like because one of my classmates he's like working for those kind of companies kan the engineering stuff and then he didn't see that they are going through retrenchment soon or something like that at that point of time during our exam so like very busy
why really what you watch big bang theory big bang theory not really
uh
the only the only constant is change
I know ya the only constant thing is change
it is do you do you restart
let's say you were not actually doesn't matter lah
no no no what I meant doesn't matter is just okay did you apply through the app
any customers yet
no no one has reached out to yellow door yoga
Y D Y
yellow door yellow door Y D Y Y Y yellow door
come to yellow yoga
balance
can there's a lot of people doing it so you got to be ya you find a niche what
got no cases what
oh are you hungry
no I have not
well my wife say she'll wake up in the morning for breakfast but apparently she didn't wake up
ah no it's like that
so basically it's like amazon prime then like you know ya
but that one starhub what I don't know
oh
is it now a good time to spend on this
there is what now
ya have to lah have to I got my parasites at home ya ya you can the can link to Netflix
to watch Netflix
ya my is like to watch Netflix YouTube
and since I bought the antenna so now can watch channel five ya cause I didn't get the set up box I did last time no no it's like every year thingy lah you have to but this one because that time when I bought it when it first came out it was really wonky
very actually laggy lah the processor is but I but I actually downloaded an app which on my phone which exactly the same as that
ya can do the exact same thing so it's basically what you have in your general box which is just an app the data key so I have the app and memory of my phone
and on this one but it's been awhile since I turn it on no it's like after awhile you went on then you have to like download the new software err no it's in english
of course of course it is still on I mean cable cable in a way has died because of Netflix cause of streaming so nobody watch per say when is the last time you watch
or cinemax or
okay lah
you want to take it up is it free really but is it one year course I mean like one day course lah
so you have to go down to go to the thing
and that ya but the chinese people can can function with their language uh
but I think that's the reason why you can like you you see more instances of chinese people
it's in
latin form ah so
which one
oh ya
ah no because in october
so because the people the colleagues so she was called back to cover and then that's why the salary will be up
if for four days she cover is enough to bring back out of threshold already so
siala no I just I just told her you try december lah no she stuck in october so so it's like so now if you want september october november october is the one that stuck so okay lah november december
I don't know lah but I told her I said you get your payslip you quickly come down and apply lah said I cannot promise anything I cannot promise it will extend or whatsoever but you know the matter the fact is that as of now you can't lah cause it's like if let's say if let's say you if your salary spike up in september that's not too bad you see
ya I think they will I don't think they will just I think they will give a buffer cause previously come on lah even with our colleagues also some of them also huh what's that it's been how many months been around what still don't know what's going on
it's been awhile already
it's been almost two years since I did it
no when she came she actually asked for malay speaking officer then I was like then I'm like eh malay speaking
malay speaking

orh
um but I think
they will change I think
I mean okay lah that one I let people go to the extreme
sabo sabo king
err
but daddy bear actually could ah not really cause the one outside technically the switch is inside yup no the thing is it is cold then just shift lah maybe your side is what you you're technically under the vent oh ya actually she cannot if you think is no I never honestly why would I touch it's there ya ya here so that time like julie did ask me like but I was doing work

mm
mmhmm
ya lah
mm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
oh
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
err you want me to countdown
eight nine eight seven six five four three two one
happy new year

mmhmm
mm
uh it's a very it's a very interesting job and it's uh the pay is good the I just have to go there and basically I pretend to be a customer lah
then uh I have there's a whole checklist of things lah that I need to look like the shop display the product display then the some
err groceries she have to go to a few uh supermarket
hypermarket that kind of thing uh all within her area
so it can be like anything lah depends on the product they are doing the survey for
to actually err
err do a survey on the product pricing
mm
mm
no I think when they when you do for them right they will give you the assignment then you go and do right they will give you like one week or two weeks they will give you a deadline that you have to come back to them with the result lah responses ah
you just come back to the office then you just you submit everything so they will look through I think you should get your pay around one week later
but it was just like say uh one retailer then I think two three usually it's three and more lah three different outlet
and ya but it's not hundred lah is only but it's the pay is good lah for that time
outlet kan then um
ya
uh price about it it's the same lah because it's the same retailer pe
and then err I had uh my my
my assignment was I have to be a difficult customer
so I have to be like a shopper lah like have to go around like I want to try this I want to try that this one got other size this one got the colour like testing the patience eh
ya and then after that it was very fun because I find that ya I don't have to purchase anything what at the end of the day I just have to rate them
so err it was interesting then after that err
I just
ya I I mean I managed to rate them lah then I I go into the fitting room and I quickly take out my paper and quickly write down like whatever in case I forgot
ya lah but then no choice what and then is this this is like uh you are earning what is like a job so no choice and I think the shops are also uh
they they know that mean their their company already inform them lah like
maybe informed the manager lah not the ground staff maybe informed the manager that
that kind of thing lah they don't say like mystery shopper lah maybe surveyor lah
ah they don't know who they don't know when
they then only know this week got one person one uh uh a surveyor is coming to check out the store so every all the staff is
informed to like be in their best behaviour like be the best giving your the best service
mm
then too bad lah then you know like they are not consistent right so obvious
the thing that they the good thing is that the staff already know lah that this week uh got got got what shopper so they don't know who so this whole week they are they will be in their best
uh customer service you know that they can give but then uh other weeks maybe we don't know so it's like that lor
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
one year eh
mm
oh my gosh
mm
it's like part time ah
oh
wow
okay
mm
mm
just nice
mm
ya lah
that's why
mm
mm ah ah
mm
ya ya
two staff only right at the outlet
mm
ya but
wah that's nothing new lah because like now I think everybody is looking for a job
right so it's like like like so many applicants to one job so it's like it's a numbers game ah
mm
mm
mm
and then like uh my friend was saying ah like you can easily earn hundred dollars if you work longer shift you know like or like you full do full time the pay is really good lah
ya lah no it's more than ten I think
mm
true lah
ya lah
mm
ah
mm
but you mean your current job is they give you two days work week right
mm
oh
like that like like they give you a schedule is it then when they will inform you like one week in advance ah like okay next week you only do you work monday friday only ah
ah
mm
orh
ya lah
true true
like that is like also working part time at your current job but it's just that they will assign you your shift I mean your your days of work like whenever you know
mm
mm
oh but over there she get full time instead of the three days part time
mmhmm
huh
ah
wow lucky sia
hmm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya lah
oh ya
ya ah
mm
ya lah like they have to save cost lah if but then
and then I mean like the owner also cannot like uh reduce the
the
the rental right ya lor
mm mm
why
mmhmm mmhmm
orh okay
mmhmm
uh huh
mm
mm
oh my god
mm
mm
oh so interesting
mm
oh
ah okay
mm
oh
ya lah
mm
ah that's smart
ya lah
but then you have to get used to staying with a stranger I mean like outsiders eh
mm
ya lah ya lah true
mm
oh he's staying alone now is it
mm
ya but is he still paying for the house or it's already fully paid
mm
ya lah true
ya lah ya lah
mm
but it's good lah I mean like whatever he lost I mean like the thirty percent that he didn't get from the pay right he actually make up for it with the rental
that's good
stability I I think everybody is quite is being very cautious also ah
and then uh we are also like doing travel insurance then so travel insurance is very much affected like nobody's travelling
so that that's already like zero percent revenue coming in eh
and
like you see like everywhere you apply also like like I see lah like one job like ten applicants or twenty applicants applying for one job
in a couple of months down the road who knows and then if I will have to start looking it's like so competitive
and then uh don't know if there is even a job then I I haven't been looking lah but
yesterday I I just yesterday was the first time I just browse through linkedin ah so so far there's still a lot of job I don't know how these company
can actually keep still keep recruiting for for admin backend support
and uh and and and the job scope the funny thing is the job scope still put there to to arrange travel uh travel arrangement visa application I was like
who travel at this point of time I mean I don't know lah but my whole company is like they freeze travel lah
like for to do travel booking lah visa application I was like but where got people travel nowadays
really
mm
mm
ya lah crazy right that's why and then you see the job scope right it's still the is all the same thing lah basically like
travel and then after that set up meeting blah blah blah but I was like the travel part is like I'm curious I was thinking
and then especially if I see like on linkedin right the the recruit is from a recruiter eh
from like ah ah headhunter agency eh no recruitment agency right
then I'll be like so skeptical like are they just collecting data collecting resumes so that later on they can just call you up
mm
mm
ya lah
kan I also thought like that so I thought like maybe tonight ah I want to just send out resumes and see
whether got uh really like they will call me and arrange really will arrange interview or not
see how it goes like like play them back
ya lor makes sense actually I saw the one that I saw is uh four thousand five I happy already four thousand five more achievable six thousand is too far away
can lah wei cause uh like more senior level lah like you got years of experience and plus if they are in it it mean if they are lucky lah they get a very easy boss
with
eh you never know you know my previous company there's this one err uh E old she's not just senior she's also old
and she just sit down and do and just go around I mean just basically going around the office and talking to people
and then go for lunch for very long and then just
she likes to delegate and conquer her job she go and did whatever she get right she will ask this person to do ask this person and every ask will ask everybody to do lah
except for herself unless if like her boss is in town in the office then she will like
like what why why are you being paid eight nine thousand doing nothing like you could just go around and she can go for like yearly europe trips okay
and then her boss always fly around so she's quite free
ah yes yes yes they say golden handshake lah but we all speculate like there's something else but anyway we're evil people
then after one month she's also asked to leave she is not even asked to take care of another team or another department eh
because obviously you are being paid too high lah and people have eyes to see what so I think
even though you are being paid very well at the moment I mean there's always a time when you will fall lah like too bad
then she got one condo that she's renting out and she got another place to stay and she got every uh I think september october period she will go
that's why like I'm so pissed off like we have to do from scratch powerpoint hers is just she ask people to do
then she take the powerpoint she check everything nice already then she just give her boss then her boss will do the presentation
uh
oh my gosh ya lah she's she very good at the work smart but I don't know how is she now but they say like even though she got retrenched or she got asked to leave right
she won't she will still continue to survive lah because she's such she's so rich eh
mm
ya lah
mm
ya lah that's why I was like uh oh my gosh like so some people are so lucky
oh she's been there for a long very long lah usually those uh who get paid very high almost ten K is those that has been working there like more than five years
and has been with the same boss
mm
mm
really ah
mm
mm
ya that time my friend got told me the uh one of her experience kan
the the wife actually came to the office to get money from the husband
then because that time she was the or something then she was then the but she already got the authority lah the the boss will give her the supplementary card eh but the but don't know why
the boss don't want to give to the wife directly or forgot or whatever lah whatever reason
until the boss that got one day the boss go and tell her uh eh later my wife is coming just pass her the card
then then later the wife really come then I was like wah so interesting I never like encounter this kind of thing before but she say it's like
cool lah like like you experience a lot you know then you can really see the wife come and like
uh ya I need to take something from my husband you know then then she will like ya it's in this envelope like it's uh he already ask me to pass you I was like
mm
ah ah
uh huh ya
oh
mm
mm
mm
wow
mm
mm
huh
oh my gosh
mm
mm
mm
ya lah at least can just must tell him right
ya lah irritating because usually when they travel it's uh company what so but they can accumulate their own points
haiya
ya lah
oh
mm
mm
ya lah that's why we are supposed to see like the
whether the boss will always change or not if were those that will keep on changing changing one then no choice have to take the hundred percent free cancellation the the most expensive one ah
then if like those who like really will keep to the the the itinerary and will not change right ah okay then we can get the cheapest ah like more less less risk
ya lor
mm mm mm
cannot lah cannot cannot waive off the thing also still have to pay the penalty because uh it's I think oh that one is because the name
the name is uh typo error or something typo
but it's so irritating seh because we went back and forth then I was telling them like uh when oh no the
because when I put in my email address or something one of the button right it auto change
back button ah
instead of typing out everything right because when they prompt me is it you want to use this email address I straightaway click right
so once I click that one ah the one on top all change to my name
and then I never check the passenger name what I straight because I initially I remembered when I fill in the passenger name I fill in correctly what
so after that I went ahead and pay pay pay pay pay after that when I paid then they came out the passenger's name is my name then I was like oh shit
auto fill so uh I put in the alphabet then after that they auto they prompt me is it like this email address so I click the auto fill lah
how would I know when I click auto fill like
the passenger name also got change
anyway so I still have to pay ah I have to purchase a a brand new ticket and this ticket is forfeited ah no show ah
I see
I think four hundred plus is it
mm luckily like promotion and cheapest eh
oh I go and book I go and book because it was like so many people travelling eh and then I like I get so confused I think at that time I was doing like
seven eight people from my team then uh after that there's like three other people that it's not from my team also I have to do
three others lah uh there's no three of them supposed to be travelling from that night right from vietnam to singapore three of them supposed to take the flight the same flight oh
from the company uh book for us and the three of us supposed to travel together ah
for tomorrow night instead of tonight and did you know that three of us are really at the airport and two of them is waving goodbye to him now because I'm stuck at the vietnam airport
he cannot leave as per what I've already booked for him
panic sia but luckily like
to spare for me because when I called them they say don't have
she she ya she book for me the wrong date and I didn't check and now I'm stranded in vietnam and I can't attend the meeting which he the day that he was supposed to be back in singapore ah
ya lah
kan
ya lah true lah
timing as if you take the next day afternoon flight which is much shorter time in the plane eh
I was like no I just inform the finance uh girl accountant
vietnam airlines I think ya lah
then die die also want to travel the next day but must be earlier must be earlier
ho chi minh ho chi minh
like coincidentally that day really like everything is like I mean that I really have no other seats eh no seats at all
crazy
five star and must be really according to his type of room and must be smoking room he's very particular eh
two colleagues is waving goodbye at you and you are supposed to get on the same flight and then
and they are leaving you at the airport and you are stranded without a hotel and a flight
but actually they they pass everything to me then I was like I cannot you tell me at five on a friday and you want to fly I think some of them flying on saturday some flying on monday eh
ah
mm
oh ya ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
so he take ya lah ah that's why some is his people her people some is my people right it's like different team kan
no huh
after that he we can still like laugh about it that kind but when work is like he's very serious ah but okay lah
after that my friend was like eh I cannot book then I was like eh I got two I still got two rooms you know at hotels dot com it's still uh showing available
mm
mm
oh no wonder
mm
mm
eh like like can't you all like plan earlier is like so painful so I I'm quite thankful that it's COVID now so no travel
but once COVID is over I'm like wah
every time I do travel like so messy seh
ya but it was very funny uh but now now that the travelling stopped for awhile right I think when once it start again I need to refresh refresher courses
mm
ya lah mm mm
ya
mm
mm
oh
ah
hmm
you mean I can just call them and ask
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
then I buy ah urgent visa lah which cost like I think four hundred over dollars eh
I think hong kong or somewhere lah that is a chinese uh I mean a a locals asia PAC ah
not china leh we seldom go china what it's hong kong not
philippine
uh this type of country uh
oh vietnam maybe vietnam passport
passport ah I think passport right
mm
and he doesn't need to like I think it's quite recently that they changed the countries eh
the countries that uh can my must apply visa cannot apply visa on arrival he say last time when he when he go there he straightaway apply visa on arrival it's like no issues
kan
hmm
ya lah
then he was asking me so err did I get my visa already
aiyo
ya
I don't know
ah ha kan
the one with the censored one or the correct one
haiya
hmm but it's fun lah I mean I mean it's it's quite nice lah
mm
ya lah
that's why it's like but I'm just very thankful like so far up up till now it's still okay lah but I'm just say I'm just
counting my days lah I won't be lucky forever I'm just
ya lah
kan
mm
ya lah whether I can whether they will survive or not if they survive I survive ah but like suddenly if they ask me to leave then how
mm local
that's why it's
so should I find a job or not should I apply for a new job or what
ya and then maybe if something comes up
right
ya lah ya lah that's why just go and find only lah ah
just
but like not in a desperate need lah like just send out first and then uh see if like got interview just go and then you know like keep the options open in case

letting you resign you stay for one more year okay then I stay for one year so six years already at the end of the six years the the yearly review you know the one to one talk with the bosses then I said okay I'm gonna to resign already no no no you stay for one more year okay dah stay I there they manage to stop me
so after seven years when I went into the living room I went in I sit down with my manager and my director before I sat down I told them okay both of you be quiet I'm going to talk
I told them I'm going to resign and there's nothing both of you can say that I that will make me stay okay so that's that I don't want to hear my grade I don't want to hear how much bonus you wanna give me I want to resign
ah
mm
ya it ya that's a good thing about government job is literally what they call iron rice bowl so I'm very I'm pretty sure that even during now this COVID time I will still be getting my pay eventhough work from home and all that I will not ever be getting retrenched from a government job

why why
at both
ya singaporean singapore
eh
I can't believe it
hotel is like a like not annual but they always bring it back a lot of times
actress actor one ah
all the ya
boring
boring jer
uh uh I can't make you
ah ya ya ya
romance ah
okay lah um but it's it's funny because they take all kind of
asians into that show I mean like they are not chinese they are not even chinese because got ken ken jeong he's korean then got the awkwafina
orh you asian you can join this show like that ah
at what to what extent is the diversity
mm mm
that trend it's like a trend now
uh huh
type casted uh that's what it call right ya
he handsome ah that handsome guy
oh my god he's so handsome
ya
uh huh
okay
uh uh
it's funny
yes
ya
ya
ya
no ya ya ya ya I think in general
okay wait it's always not all
ya
gender ah we are very different
what the shit
oh sorry
you don't have to
like female discrimination discriminatory uh ya
if you cannot look past my curse you cannot look past my tone of my voice then you you you not even looking at the problem at the first place
oh my god
but then
uh what about the things we have you know
but then I've to watch when she watch then I like oh no that's so bad
oh this is so bad
ya and and they have a lot of shows because they are very funded their arts is very funded I mean look at K pop
something that singapore cannot achieve
really ah I don't think they will ever

mmhmm
ah ya ya ya I remember her
mmhmm
oh really
ya you put baking soda inside cookies
mm I'm not so sure I think you can do some uh admin job duties I know in my workplace uh sometimes we have um we need we get orders from customers for bentos or for events so maybe you can try to get that kind of position maybe I can let my boss know whether he is willing to uh hire someone for the time being especially during this period lah
no I don't think there'll be algebra inside so I think I will let him know okay
mm I think like
there's a lot of issues that I see like with malay hijabis not uh not getting jobs being discriminated because I saw like this classmate of mine in polytechnic
recently she did this um poll lah uh asking whether like have any of us malay hijabis ever face discrimination and I saw that majority of her respondents had receive discrimination but for me I'm thankful that so far I didn't face any sort of discrimination when applying for jobs or for university
I'm thankful that I didn't face that kind of discrimination but at the same time I feel like quite upset lah like this is happening to some of my friends who have the qualifications they already have they already met all the criteria they have the skills they have good grades for school but
why is it that they are not getting the job just because they are wearing hijab I think a hijab is just just a piece of clothing it's like you know you're wearing a T-shirt it's just a piece of clothing why why is it that they don't allow muslim ladies to wear hijabs I don't get it
what
oh
mm
wah
ya
and I also have like my cousin she is working as a nurse and you know that in the healthcare industry uh for muslim ladies they are not allowed to wear the hijab when they are doing their jobs but then I don't know I find it kind of weird does the hijab err restrict them in doing any sort of jobs
I don't know I mean when when you wear a hijab maybe they are worried oh let's say what if the medicine or anything like
and I think in social media it has been blowing up ah but I think to know a still they are not allowed to wear which I find it kind of funny because I know that in malaysia they allow their nurses to wear and then I was like thinking if malaysia can wear how come singapore cannot wear I don't know it's kind of weird
really
maybe you should have joined should have considered yoga like even though it is like there's still some warm-ups you have to do but at least you don't sweat that as much and you still feel a little bit uncomfortable-ness but still okay lah ha
aww
it's not fated man
what
there's better men out there so don't worry about him
why
ya
err what what what does that guy do is he working or studying or
oh
ya ya ya
oh my god I hate procrastination
the day before the day when oh my god
at four o'clock
oh my god mm
oh my god how dare you make a girl wait
oh my god
huh what kind of guy is that
huh
then how do you exist
ya lor might as well just don't pray lor you leave the religion I mean it's a bit extreme lah but
I don't know how to say this it's a bit of a sensitive issue
mm
ya exactly
so when are you going to meet this guy
you got the picture or not
oh
mmhmm

oh world of married
what is it about
oh
oh
mm
oh
you know
lately right
I feel that there's a lot of
celebrities
who are getting divorced
cause like you you know like Syamsul Yusof right
I feel very sad for him seh cause like he's like my favourite
it really make me feel sad cause I thought that was the love of his life seh
hmm
but I don't know eh cause like
they were married since two thousand fourteen if I'm not wrong so it's been six years
and then um
but I just feel that is sad cause they already have like
two
uh children I think one of it
uh is a guy one is a girl
then um I know Puteri uh which is
his wife right
is someone who is very like patient and kind and nice
and for her to file a
uh divorce right
it really shows that
maybe Syamsul did something ah but I don't know seh
or maybe like they just not happy with each other anymore
makes me feel
very sad honestly cause like
I will I saw their like um
marriage and everything
and then actually uh on the day that they got married right
he was
actually sick
he was really sick eh but then he went ahead with the marriage
and then it made me feel like
wah if he
went through that and if he like at that point of time
and then
when this kind of thing happen right it make me doubt love
seh like how can he be so sure then at the end of the day
he's not going to be with her anymore
ya I guess
but you know
other than um
like Syamsul Yusof all right
I also remember got this
I think
you know Alif Aziz
and Bella ya I think that that kind of stories also quite sad cause like
they
I feel like Alif is kind of a toxic person but
he kind of love Bella and Bella has no choice cause Bella is very soft
of loving someone who is
toxic
why but then bella was saying like oh
ya
ya
ya ya ya ya
I feel I don't feel um
um scared but he put up a very like brave front like like he got everything under control
ya
mm
but I think it's also because um he
I mean the other girls were like not even
um saying sorry or anything
oh your hair
um I don't know seh I think you should just
it's really like half the price of the original price
ya so you should just go for it ah
I going school at I think I need to be in school by ten so I need to leave house at around nine
ya
but then tomorrow right it's just like from ten to
ah
from ten to to eh
ya
but I have a lot to do so
I don't know anyone there so
the food there is boring
ya there's nothing interesting
uh okay lah but like I feel like food is nicer
ah which make me feel so like
ya
I feel so sad cause my school really no don't have not enough food like nice food
foodpanda or what ah
ya
oh my dance classes eh
um
but all of them were nice and although they have prior experience right
they didn't they wouldn't so like
show off kind I mean there's actually one guy who is like you know those like humble brag kind of guy
ya
mmhmm
then isn't it better
oh ya I don't think your colleague are really like the best but okay lah
you know
I feel a bit
sad that you are not in the same school as me
maybe but like I feel that everyone
and then
it's like everyone is so like
studious they are not really
my kind where is like they chiong last minute or what
I just feel
so lost
as in I chiong last minute but they all very studious like
three
or week four
I don't know seh
but ya and then
oh did I tell you I met
uh our soccer friends
ah our captain remember
ya
ya the same place as me ah
ah my our campus is
ah Dover
ya
ya oh my god I was so happy when I saw them I like went up to them hug them and everything
ya
is like a
a website ah where you can get like cheaper clothes
ya but then like I really need to look at the review ah
ya and I thought of buying it ah cause like
I feel like
mmhmm
why fifty dollar quite a lot what
oh
but I think in your
because you only receive like nine hundred ah spending money how to save
ya
eh I feel that the money that you have
spend for the month
but like maybe okay lah not that
direct nine hundred ah but like
those kind of thing
ya it's very hard
I mean
I think
it's normal for everyone to struggle but
those
who don't have biology background will struggle more
definitely
mm I like it but there are just some parts that is just too draining honestly
orh for Anas eh
ya I mean I feel for Anas right maybe you should get him clothes
I think it's safe to buy triple eh
cause he has been wearing the same thing for so long
no it's cause he doesn't where to shop he doesn't have
time to shop
ya
no as in can buy the casual kind like not black maybe like purple
or like blue
he bought
he bought purple okay like lavender purple
also cute
ya but he never use
because
ya you can buy
and everything
I think
he's
struggling
in a way
sometimes you have no choice but to just suck it up
ya I mean he really has such a very packed schedule
I don't think he has time to meet people also
maybe if you just ask him out cause like even Dakshah had to ask him out
mm
ya that's true
depends ah
uh a bit of physics but other than that no
oh did mama tell you that
oh
mm
ya I mean it really stems to your parents also lah I mean
I don't know I just feel that sometimes
um
doesn't work that way you know
oh he's nice
I thought he like don't want to do work all
oh he did huh what did he do
oh
that's cute you mean you mean when he was sick he came over
orh but how much were you paid per month
huh fifty jer
wasn't it seventy
fifty for four sessions
fifty divide by four is how much
for one hour two hour
oh my god not worth it sis
I mean like
ya lah you can say like oh you want to help the child everything but wow
that progress and also the time spent right
but really marks where you can go
the place where you
make it or break it seh
ya I mean
minahish and stuff you know
cause I feel that our secondary school was kind of decent in a way
but like if you look at other schools
that shall be not shall not be named right
it's really scary
like you know all those
STOMP news and everything
um the
scary ah that how young and how brave are you to do that
what
then if I put myself in the shoe of like
a parent or like a secondary school teacher right
I wouldn't know how to deal with it seh like I feel that you are so young
and I feel that it's a lot to do with like
Instagram
you know all these kind of things
I'm not sure whether like
there is an increase in like early pregnancy early teen pregnancy or whatever seh
ya cause like I feel
teachers
ya I mean I feel that
my secondary school is the reason why I have like anxiety in a way cause like they make such small things into very very big matter
ya then like
being like what fourteen fifteen I was very affected by it
and then they just um try to force their beliefs down our throats
you know I'm actually quite surprised
and that one also like the discipline master don't know what to do then just let us go
secondary school
oh but I thought
but I thought we always go to school together
oh
oh my gosh okay
ah why he like that seh
you reminded me of our netball coach
how old was she ah when she took our
so she was like in her early twenties right
wah early twenties then she act until like that
oh
she's another reason why I feel like I have anxiety
I can't believe she make me do suicide run again with all the team just cause
like
I couldn't make it
then like the whole team like hates me for it
oh when was I there
oh
she left training halfway
ya that is really some kind of trauma that she leave us with seh
mm
oh my god ya it was during like the
um
exam kan
I mean how we've been overworked
talented players or what they always don't want to
pass the ball to us
ya
that and the fact that you know
I feel that everyone was just so scared of coach
and that make everyone like try so hard to perform that they underperform
oh I know I know
she chinese that one right
ya I remember her oh my god
err
ya I didn't join any sports
just
I mean she gave me a lot of trauma lah to be honest
mm
so supportive and stuff
ya
I
I don't know if you know this Instagram ah it's called Sanwraps
they sell like the cutest combination of flowers bouquet ever like they have daisies they have tulips and then they have roses
ya
ya
wilt wilted eh
wilting eh
ya
and
ya but the anti is spelled as A N T E A
ya
but it's not I don't think it's halal lah but then
they brew their coffee eh no they brew their tea
from scratch
and it's like supposedly the most like high quality tea
a'ah Singapore
huh why you ask me that
oh um
haiya for me
hmm let me think
actually
I know that
like if especially if my husband wants a child
ya
I mean like you can always say oh I will treat this as my my everything but
at the end of the day in black and white you know that this child is
someone else's one
that's why
ah
wouldn't say it bothers
me but
it's just a thought in my head ah
ah
ya
I I don't know ah
but
this says something about
I mean
I'm not really a fan of children in the first place also
so
that's some somewhere to start
you love cats
I don't think I will cause
I need to
be responsible of like their food their pee and then like the furniture is gonna get scretched
and I don't think I have the energy to do that
mm
that's why
and then I saw like the rabbits were like
having like sexual intercourse with one another and we like scarred before moment
because like
they keep rattling the cage and all makes me feel that actually like house all like not
suitable for their environment ah it's like why would you keep them there seh
oh actually ah
being in the zoo right it helps preserve like endangered species
and they create the habitat in a way that
is very like very very similar to those in the wild
oh
mmhmm

mm
mmhmm mmhmm
mm
mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
how much was your kurta
okay
still okay
mm
ya
escalator escalator
ya
so I had to win that game
mm
in terms of talking or whatever with new people so that was a very good ice breaker like but I don't know if it applies for everyone because some people might not like board games some people might find it boring and that's the starting thing that they do they might lose interest already but I love I love games err and this just brought me back to
early times ah I guess
mm
um the game of life is basically
my friends so we went out one day looking for board games
and that happens to be one of them and I don't know how to play snake and ladders
and then there was
mm
pick up sticks
ya
why
okay okay okay okay according to my understanding
different colours have different points
so the like maybe a a certain colour has the most point
so
so okay okay no no not one by one it's when it's your turn you try to take as many as possible then the moment the move the next person go
ya
mm
ya so the moment any sticks move then it's someone else's turn
back then eh ya
oh ya ya ya
mm
I
oh congkak yes
ah but side track back to what we which one were we talking about which game
congkak yes I actually really like congkak
okay
where it's like a kampung where it's design and and like err painted in a way that looks like a kampung so there was like hopscotch on the floor there were games here and there
ya err ya I'm trying to think whether my primary school was like a
ya I was from woodlands lah so
mm
ya ya
mm
mm ya something like that ya ya ya mm
yes yes that one is like the spider spider plastic spider
ya that one never play before
the ya
how
okay yes correct but that's like the cheating way
ya oh my god the amount of money you can get if of that singapore flag
mm
mm
five two dollars ya entrepreneurial skills
I don't know it's okay
entrepreneurial I think so entrepreneurial skills
I do want to have
wait by the way I am twenty four currently I am working ah full time right now um in an office I work in an office job for a business school
um so I'm just giving you a bit of context lah eh um I do
think that one day I want to have my own business
or my little my like a small company or something
like there are other goals I want to achieve first
and then when I am a bit more stable when I got a bit more capital and I feel like it's err and a time where I'm more comfortable
to
go with the business I would
the company
that that idea is taken away that's true but I feel like one of the essence of being an entrepreneur is envision
innovation and the ability to like
it's not say be creative or whatever it's like
finding the next thing like you know that err sometimes being an entrepreneur is not just about the product it's about you and like how you can face certain like situations like for example if someone takes your idea
they cannot take away your entrepreneur skills
but I think for now no lah
SIRI hey SIRI what's the meaning of entrepreneurial
entrepreneur definition thanks SIRI
in terms of business or just in life
business eh
okay ya desi perkins is a youtuber that I really really like I follow her for a while already um on youtube I've watched her grow from when it was just her making makeup
and then after that sunglass company the collab and then did a few more collabs here and there that's when she started her own company of like these glasses but okay like as much as I love her
um like her story
ah okay and my respect about the start that company in the middle of her pregnancy which is like both her babies you know like
my number one idol when it comes to business
err I don't know if I look up to anyone
so much like I don't have anyone in mind other than for now rihanna
err ya ya fenty fenty became
yes yes yes I knew you were going to react that way like fenty is actually her real name like rihanna was a middle name or something like that ya oh no no robyn
robyn
robyn fenty
ya okay I ya either way it's not rihanna is not the actual like first name
it's like robyn robyn fenty something like that I don't know okay but anyway like fenty I maybe fenty was like a very strong family name or something I don't know I don't remember but but fenty became
just something that can be used by everybody and not leaving anyone out and I love that's about it comes from someone who went through that
and like she kept that in mind
no actually it's not even kept that in mind that became the driving force of all her products
like the first brand to have foundation of like twenty plus shades
you know usually it's like maybe half of that amount or like even lesser you know and it's really respectable lah so ever since that that makeup and and I think all the other brands that she's been I mean all the other products ah like companies that she made
like gave her so much respect in that
like err area of business
so I like that the makeup and then she did lingerie after that right and then she has a Savage Savage fenty Savage fenty and then um she also has
err like a luxury line which I forgot ah I think it's just called fenty ya
I miss her music by the way
when it comes to business okay who do you look up to
wait for what okay yes yes
I okay we we're wow this is a good question like what
is success to me when it comes to business mm
I I think what success is
is like maybe lah for now
is
if I'm if I do something I'm passionate about
and I can earn from it like
like I think to me that is success
mm mm
boyfriend ya the one with the kids but they never actually got married it's okay don't you don't have to but anyway so you have to follow all the people that scott disick follows so I realise that all the people that he follows are all businesses
ya go ahead
yes
mm
following ya correct
ya correct correct for all ya ya ya as in ya that's very true that's very true okay so ya maybe that's it
so um
um the account was giving seventy K seventy K
no it's like they have it all the time like I think account they have all the time so the next one is ten K ten K plus err the iphone new iphone
I
oh I said I think in the answers I said my mum I said I wanted to help my mum first I said I had student loans to err to um settle I have a passion for music I want to pursue music and if possible I want to start my own little business so that was my answer like
that's what I'm going to do that's what who I want to share with kind of thing but it was just a brief thing like there's so much more right like I told you right like the plans and shit
ya so
fuzzy wuzzy like
wow fuzzy little hearty we should make a song
fuzzy little hearty mm
ya
ya
ya
wait so the amount wasn't exactly hundred K it was seventy K but round up
what what what
I might keep like one or two or two or three no it's a lot of bags like like
I think eight to ten bags so I would keep a few I don't have
ya
mmhmm
from kylie jenner exactly like it's proven that it was from kylie so that's true that's true that's true
almost luggage size kind you know like really big ones so I think is different for each but I think we can really make a lot of money from there lah but
I don't know maybe like I might not sell lah
and then let it appreciate value like that value exist
I don't know like in the future when it becomes a bit more vintage or something in the and I don't know I don't know either you're still gaining cause you didn't pay anything for it like you know
but okay anyway like ya so that was the competition
ya why ah you you ask me that before
mmhmm
okay

they use to work ya my mum used to work at coach
like I would really like to own maybe something from chanel or gucci or versace these three these three I really like
mm
ya but that's the thing like I think it comes with the experience because it's suppose to make you feel like
like oh I can afford this you know like so it comes with it lah
ya
so that's that with the luxury brands
mm
mm mm

mm
ya
I don't I think it's more expensive than that ya
ah the keychain itself right

wah bullshit
ya
a doctorate
ya like
err okay I work in a business school you know and I have I have a err not lecturer what's it call like a professor whose name is doctor C J maddox but she doesn't take medical she's in business ya doctor C J maddox doctor banu doctor shout out to all the business school teachers
see for ourselves you know it's not a goal or like
mm game of life is not bad so they actually gave give you a wheel to spin it's not a dice

also teaching you about capitalism same thing

I don't know
no
capitalism it's just I guess freedom what no no no no no
what
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya we are toning down a lot for this but okay
yes
nice
oh well you manipulated me
it's about if you have friends who always judge you for your jokes then it sucks right it's better if you if if if they have similar humour that is great that's kind of what I look for also in a like in a partner but
moving forward err ya but humour is humour is a huge thing for me
um
no
next time okay then I'll explain further okay so or there are certain food that I don't like but okay to answer your question no like they don't have to like the same things that I do
mm food is not like a matter in terms of like friendship
astons
mm
ya she also very vibrant
character yes shout out to her but um ya really like andes andes is like one of our go to date places
andes
ya lah we don't know if he's meditating or what but he was sitting under a tree when I was on the way like you know the car passes by the road sides and all right so that that it's exactly like that so he was just sitting under a tree minding his own business so I was like okay
he takes his breaks outside just sitting under the tree calmly okay so it's an assumption that he meditates or he probably doesn't he just like relaxing
ya maybe
ya what do I do to handle stress I can call all your reference aww but err I usually would I'm not
I I don't see myself as a person who keeps it all in that's not my kind of person ah but I'm very particular with who I share it with as well
um like the best of times for me I would share it with the certain people like my boyfriend like um
maybe some like close friends as well so
that
stress ah to a certain extent sometimes you don't need someone to tell you or advice you whatever if someone's there to listen
just to be just to let a bit of load off your shoulders ah it'd be nice
ya
that is not that is not a main requirement and err
mmhmm
I
I guess that's like okay like having that friend is
probably would put you in check a bit more
err but what if you really got no other choice then hearing that is just going to make you feel more like terrible sometimes you know
err I would prefer a person who is down for you who will really really support you um sometimes it doesn't even need questioning you know so ya
you do
ya

but not as
a story that happen to you that was so embarrassing
I mean
I looking at this
I looking at that guy
I don't uh care if I answers the
K um
there was this one time
there's only one time that I was actually I was just sitting at the chair then I wanted
I was so embarrassed at that point then when I left there I heard someone laugh ya allah

no lah just any embarrassing moment
is it the colour
mm
oh goodness
oh my god then change your pants
I don't care lah

it's just like
err okay
mm
eighteen already
no lah no no it's just a that happen in your daily life that happen in your
that happened then I'm like okay that's weird that's also actually quite embarrassed and I'm like okay

okay
alright
ah
tenet
okay ah basically he borrowed money without my knowledge
this is less still shady ah
I don't know who
thing is
what
whether
damn
ya
ya
ya
basically like he was caught in the crossfire lah
once in the
ah
actually unofficial entity that borrows people money
you tell
then I found out he hasn't paid in full that's why they are chasing after him
last month last month not a lot lah close to one thousand
yup that's it ah
at least that's the only thing I know of ah
uh his credit rating is bad
I think he needed money ah
ya
oh that this is the case I mean I think I got enough problem to since I stayed over there
don't do this ah
it's not what but
you
you didn't really
you know right not the end of this month next month lah cause our initial agreement was six months what
uh next year
friend ah
no one listens to me kan
the voice of reason
ya
now I have problem
I have solution that fixes the problem now but later got problem I don't care ah that kind of thing ah
ya
I have a problem their their solution is this
but it fixes my problem now
but later I have bigger problems
doesn't matter as long as it as it fixes my problem now
ya
actually by end of this month
but
like I did tell
ya just say just say
ya
but
they were they kept calling him non-stop unknown number
he was pissed ah
rightfully so ah to be pissed
exactly
as of now today tonight
I have no idea I think he staying somewhere else for now not sure
too ashamed to show his face
still here
you have a place to go but you rather not ah
that kind of situation ah
ya basically lah same thing ah
wait
he has an option but he rather not take it ah
but
now seeing this
you know
you you are you did
you should apologise more to our friend ah rather than me but I'm just concerned that I don't know what else you did that you haven't told me
I have
I have
eh
his side business side hustle side hustle
what
how I know oh but
you know people are driven by greed what some people do not know how to control their greed
ya the other time his money at work got stolen I told you what
um
ya he left
uh some cash cause I don't know ah he sounds like an old man I don't trust banks I don't want to put money in bank
I have no idea why
and then afterwards he left his money at work at work locker not just work ya not even a safe
I keep advising him keep your money in in the bank
cause
no one listens to me
mm
mm
ya
ya
alright
by end of this month
ya one thousand two plus rental one thousand
four
ya
it's really cheap ah
okay
so
mm
sort of
fahim no new developments
he's been avoiding us like the plague
I I I don't know lah whether
he's just being him you know avoiding his friends
over a girl lah
I mean technically there is a plague going on ah
okay
okay
mm
mm
okay
hmm
okay
ya ya ya yup
I've always wondered if any of them are scripted or not
probably lah eh
mm
fame
china boy
okay why
I think he still does tau maybe Facebook or something I don't know
I think so
okay which is true I don't
ah
ya ya like it it's inside lah and so it's called what you said is right correct pe
ya
why you were there lah at your place then he said if it was
if I did that
be a part of it lah cause it feels like they are validating the relationship which they shouldn't
ya just boyfriend and girlfriend ah
um
in a moral dilemma every time
that
you know I don't feel good that she's there
it doesn't feel right what
but I don't want you to be there cause
I don't want
people to think that oh I'm approving this ah it feels wrong ah
so it puts us in a tough spot ah
back then ah
I am not going to hang out with the two of you if she's there
your mistress is there once you're officially divorced I will I will hang out with you all
yup
ya
ya
typical farid lah
like shadow boy shadow boy
I think eight years
oh
okay
mm
what the
okay
hmm
loco ah
I wouldn't
know what
she's gonna be there
it came to a point where if riz there she's there
so we knew what to expect ah
do you know actually looking at this makes me realise that I shouldn't do this more than anything else
ya this is like good practical relatable lesson for me
ya
um from what I see eh
his wife now ex-wife his ex-wife had the things she needed
but not the things she wanted
and mistress had has the things he wants I'm not sure about the things he needs ah maybe she fulfils both not sure
less than twenty I've known her since two thousand eight I've met her less than twenty times
I okay I mean I mean let's just laid it all down here ah ah the good point I think she is a nice patient person
diplomatic face
I don't know
ya true
like you need to be very patient with him ah
like you know girls generally have this mentality where
it's okay for them
to
failed in life cause they have a safety net somewhere
so
they try they tend to take
weird risks ah
even at an age when you at you're not supposed to it's not applicable to all lah definitely but then it's easier to find these traits among females rather than males
prove me otherwise okay maybe but based on what I've personally observed
not saying that it's super common lah no lah just saying that
if we are comparing boys and girls it's easier to find girls with all who has those traits rather than men
ya recklessness
ah recklessness um
probably lack of ambition
ah ya privilege ah ya lah
usually
usually lah generally speaking
the daughters are spoilt by their dads and their dads has money
the sons are spoilt by their mums
the mums usually give their sons full attention
this kind of things ah
generally speaking ah
so based and on that
um
scenario like you always quite common ah for that dads to dote on their daughters and mum to dote their sons
ya so
it's quite
plausible lah I'm not saying that
bad point would be
or fittest lah even
not not even the fittest man alive ah
in terms of body
chunky
she's always been fat
as in
no okay
okay
oh did you see that post today obese is racist
where else already lah
what no one should use the word obese cause it's
what
don't know what don't know what and it's racist ah
it's nonsense
ya
sial lah brunei
ya
mm
oh is it
bulgy chonkers
ya
mm
oh
mm
ya ya ya
okay let's just call them government eh
if the government invest in their infrastructure a lot more
attack tourism ah
for investment
attack tourism ah
yup that that's the thing
country
not like
second and third
world country in southeast asia lah but still quite bad lah
if you look at the ah if you look at the net worth
of the top man there
ya yup
not close to no tax
ya healthcare is not free education
I mean there's I won't say it's not free lah it's not free
poly isn't free like everyone pays the same amount
like unless you are foreigner or I think
ah then uni isn't free
ya it should be lah or very heavily subsidise ah
but it's not okay ah let's talk about
oh so just now you wanted
to ask about
oh khai right
ya
anything lah
ya
oh
more
when it comes to that and
cause he
told me a few things that she wasn't he wasn't he wasn't happy about with her lah
too trivial lah to even consider them
to be
no cause it was too long ago when they told me it was twenty eighteen I think
you know how we talk kan
so it's hard to follow what you saying
it's like
something like that lah
oh mistress
well he consented to it lah so it's not just her fault of both of them are equally at fault
she he he he said that
she better in bed
then
I wouldn't know ah
then she slimmer
ya
if you want to do this
she was the one who needed help
but when it turn out wai was the one who needed help
so ya
I mean that's why he deal lah him he claims that
was actually a cry for help then he wasn't happy with his marriage
I don't know I think was just become very stagnant lah rather than more than anything else but he doesn't want to admit
ya
that's the thing
we told him
so we we did tell him to resolve matters with your
wife as big investment when you're still married lah if you said
I advised him not to meet your mistress first for at least two months or something
ever since news was way before I met her lah personally
don't go there it's not safe you still go there
then she wants the house she wants to fight for the house
ya probably yup
oh six
fourteen
ya
I never knew you never knew the guy as
the adultery kind
but if you remember him from back then he was always flinging around
I don't know I mean I really thought he's changed cause of
fifty percent is fine what it's both of your kid anyway
ya
like let's say me and my wife
she realise that she's better at ironing clothes so she does it
cause I suck at it lah
the rest I have to iron
yes exactly
oh okay ah
think that
I don't know
I think it's bad idea for him to live apart
she finally realise that she cannot keep this up
gaining a lot of weight her sleep apnea was really bad
which is you were there when
safwan told the story
or have you left I can't remember
he said that
his name is saifuddin
then zafran I think zafran has heard it before
and he was shocked that her they were shocked that the snoring was really loud she was sleeping in the master bedroom and they were at the living room getting so loud that they could hear it clearly in the living room
ya so I think she also realise that by gaining a lot of weight it happens to her lah
so I don't know
oh when life is good
eh
I'm on a
the frequency of how how I eat
let's say if you only want to eat twice you can eat once a day but then that's quite difficult ah
huh
I ate at four
so eat something light at night ya
it's
sixty one
ya
when we started going to the gym
ah still very very slightly above average very slightly
and based on ah
healthy ah range
but ah same lah
a
ya louder that ah
true
didn't factor that in ah
sial lah
err should be more
actually should use the malaysia malaysia one
eh should be more accurate for malay
sial ah
ah yes
one six seven
you're going to do it now
of what obesity
ya average or healthy ah
ya
wah slightly above average ah okay pe
okay lah
chonky
ya I remember
I remember
absolute unit ah
I think the heaviest I was I think lah cause I didn't check my weight for very long time think seventy I think so then it was it was good lah that that I went for the christmas dinner
I should do something about it lah
then it was difficult lah initially very difficult
then
no no no no
yup

I don't know lah cause if for me if I go to a toilet that I know that is not very clean I will
breathe through my mouth I will I will I will shut the nose and I will breathe through my mouth so I cannot smell anything

so
she pinch her nose and then she say

mmhmm
ya

where you can have just directly asked him yourself
don't don't call me to go and call him when you can call directly
stop it lah sia
and I actually tell you I am busy
my hands are like filled
the worker is not the common worker that I work with right
ah
ah
both of you are of the same size same height sia
but ya about the same size
I don't know whatever lah
I mean I just take the pot and just want to place at the location ah
that really is so funny
there are fun moments really there are actually there are many fun moments ah
uh if we say anything wrong or scold you or what right we sorry lah

uh uh sia
then then after that
err but sister if if eat late right later the food spoil lah then not nice to eat already then problem how sister
so okay lah
I want to buy biryani I even ask them you know like
the first few month of COVID
ah bulk ah
mm which eh
as long as you are happy ah
of course ah
when I was in school that's what I learn myself sia B
nobody's gonna teach you this kind of nonsense sia
err I don't know lah they they they I think they don't believe in it ah but for me is I believe in it because build rapport you know why you know why I say this thing is good or not

if you had three wishes what would you wish for
okay
okay that's one
ya
food business
okay
recently you went to schools to find stalls right
okay how was that
okay
ah
ah okay
how much was the rent for
five dollars per month
okay
then do they tell you what food you have to sell
okay
mm
okay
okay
okay
okay
so you can only hire locals
okay
mm
okay
but you can cook what
okay
mm
okay
okay
so what if you if you had a stall you'll be selling the same food
mm
mm
okay
so that's your second wish first wish is to
make sure your children
so those are your two wishes one is to make sure your children
uh good behaving
your second is to have your own business
then your third wish
mm
of course of course you would say that
but your definition of healthy is very strict
mmhmm
ya
okay
mm okay
okay
can so
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
so so your three wishes are to have
good kids
good business and good health
okay
okay
mm
okay
mm
my three wishes
I think
my first wish is very materialistic and superficial which is
I want to have
success and wealth
because
we
didn't come from very rich family or background
we had it but we were not poor either we had enough
but because of our financial background we didn't get to enjoy many things that I see my rich friends are enjoying
like they get to they travel every six months to far away countries and all that
and we didn't get to do that
so
one of my wish is
to be able to do well in school so that I can get a good job
and earn money so that we can enjoy these things in life
that is my
first wish
second wish
is to be happy
whatever that means so that's my second wish
third wish is for you to be happy
that is my third wish
ya
it's okay I'll ask the second question
um
err
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
ya
ya food food
ya
mm
okay
I think for me
will be the first time I had smoked duck
ya the smoked duck pasta
ya that's the first time I had the smoked duck pasta
and that ya it was very good I liked it
so that's ever since then I started to like eating duck because that was the first time I had duck
ya
mm
true
okay
you don't remember
anything about your memorable meals
mm
like
sniper
like a gun
as in it shoots bullets
okay
uh huh paddy field
swan
no not flamingo
flamingo
crane eh
crane
and
and did you like it
mmhmm
don't have courage to try new things
okay
okay
go somewhere else
you say one ah
don't take back on your promise ah
okay
okay then I ask you
the next question
which is
what is your favourite
genre of drama or show that you are watching now
okay
short stories like what
oh
okay
uh huh
okay do you have any
mm
cartoons you like cartoons
ya
okay
frozen you mean
okay
disney pixar lah
then you did did you watch incredibles two
mm
then do you have a name of a favourite movie
can be bollywood also
the blue aliens
okay you know they are making the second one
ya
but ya just one then they also say they have avatar three four and five also
planned out
ya
but honestly
you like twilight
the vampire movie
you know it's a trashy movie right people say is a terrible movie
but you like it
ya
mmhmm
oh okay okay
then the storyline
mm okay
mm
that's that's something new I learn about you you liking to watch twilight
mmhmm okay
then
which superhero movies have you watched
okay
so between the three do you know the three spidermans
the three actors who played spiderman three times
which one do you like
the first one your tobey maguire
or the most latest one
you like tobey
mm okay
mm
then
so if you were to
mm
uh huh
ya
so I'm
exploring two options right now
one is either to go to a private consulting firm
so I want to do consultancy
but I need to know first if consultancy is my thing
so I need to do internship again next year maybe
ya so
ya that wasn't consultancy it was more of research on and it's more on a
city like large scheme nation building
the consultancy firms usually what they do is they are more responsible for err err single projects
so let's say this mall developer wants to do the mall then he comes bring he brings his proposal lah his blueprint or whatever and then we have to see and approve and all that stuff
plan out their
master err their blueprint
the other option I'm considering is pursuing higher education so either do masters or
because I like educating
I like teaching so
if I do masters I can come back as professor in so that's my other option I'm considering also which is why monday is main
no lah professor as in
ya
as in
they all must still publish their research what like regularly publish their own research on top of teaching students
so
that's what I'm doing which is why on monday I'm going back to school
to meet my mentor
ya because when we when we
ya it's a professor so when we first come to each of us is assigned to a mentor
so we can just anytime email our mentor and ask if we can meet up and all that so I just wanna meet him and talk to him about it lah and
ya
in school
then wednesday
cause I have events on tuesdays and wednesdays also so I either thursday or friday I'll come back
ya I enjoy a lot which is
a blessing lah because many of my friends
they
not just my A level friends but also my friends from actually I mean it's mainly my A level friends because
the poly friends who come they most of them were already doing civil engineering in poly
so when they come to uni they know it's something that they like
but
my A level friends
they don't necessarily know if civil engineering is their thing
many of them are doing it because
they grades
ya poly poly their their structure is different what
for poly they already have a diploma in their diploma is specific to a course
so most of them were either doing civil engineering or they were
doing
common engineering or
something like construction
you mean from my
I only know one other person who's in
was from my also but the rest are all from different err
ya I mean I think
my school mainly all of them either went overseas
or they are in
or they are doing because civil engineering the cut off is quite low
it's all like and
so the people who come to civil engineering are not necessarily those who are interested
sometimes it's because
they are interested in another course but their grades grades couldn't make it
so they come to civil engineering instead
which is why I think
I like what I'm doing
mm
I enjoy the courses I'm doing
mostly some courses I don't like
ya
so
ya which is why as in like I feel like which is why I'm considering pursuing higher education if I don't like it I won't pursue higher education what
ya
I'll probably still stay in
ya
probably still
ya they have and masters
but as in I think
also
and it's important to start early lah because
maybe there's something I can do now to help to accelerate the process also mah
ya
I don't know so
but honestly ya
eh teaching ya
what
I don't know
full time teaching
huh go
after I graduate go
ya that's why I say as in a good like a balance of me still doing
something related to my
field civil engineering and
get to teach is by pursuing lah and becoming a prof and do both
where I get to teach and still practice what I learned
ya so
so that's my plan
after I finish studying
then what about you
mmhmm
okay
okay
mmhmm
okay
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
mm
what is the one thing that you wish was free
ya
anything lah ya what is the one thing if anything that you have to pay for what is the one thing that you wish was free
uh huh
mmhmm
okay
okay
okay
mm actually you why do you want to subsidise those shouldn't you subsidise treatment for the more common illnesses
as in you say you want to subsidise like treatment for the one that's unexpected right
but shouldn't you subsidise the one that's more common
mmhmm
ya
mm
okay
mm
okay then
so
if
three new skills what are three skills that you wish you can master
okay
okay right
yio chu kang all the way
okay
how much are you paying
mmhmm
hundred and seventy seven
okay
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
okay
mmhmm
okay
oh
ya
mm
okay
there's active what
ya
ya
no not pilates lah aerobics
no not aerobics cardio
because
twelve classes
ya group class so uh ya lah so had three class and then because of COVID
ya
okay
ya
ya
mm
okay
ya lah just go for the active one is cheaper lah
ya
mm
mm
ya
I think
ya
I think there is should
but jalan besar maybe
ya have you gone for any active you never gone for you have never gone for an active classes
mmhmm
oh the one at jalan besar swimming pool
uh huh
okay
also very far
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay

you were uh
mm
okay
mmhmm
okay
so you are improving lah
then are you still going for classes now
mmhmm
okay
okay okay
mmhmm
okay then
err
hmm
what
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
so you will eat bread toast for breakfast dinner lunch everyday for the rest of your life
ya but you will eat that for the rest of your life
bread
uh huh
mm ya
okay so what would it be
breakfast dinner lunch
everyday
that's more than one dish you can only choose one dish
mm
me
why
it's not filling what
if I were to eat one dish for the rest of my life
maybe fried rice
ya
or your mee hoon
the the the dry mee hoon
ya that's the
one dish I will eat for the rest of my life
but it must be dry cannot be the wet mee hoon
okay
hmm
so
mandi rice mm
yesterday
come you you try to smoke it but
I don't know I couldn't taste the smoky flavour or anything
ya and that's what I said what the smokiness
ya the smokiness was only on the skin
uh
ya
uh ya lah
mm
okay lah I mean
it's a normal
I can't remember if you made better mandi rice or not
ya
ya do you stuffed it right
ya
mm
when you try to make like with briyani or mandi I like I prefer
when you make simple ghee rice
with like chicken curry and papadum
is either a hit or miss sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't work
ya ya
okay lah it's not that bad also it was still good
decent
nex
ya
half half
we ordered half of as in
I think hawaiian and super supreme
ya they they changed the menu saying you can instead of one full let's say one full super supreme can now do let's say half hawaiian half super supreme
ya at the same price
I think because
I don't know lah mm mm is to cater to people
so things to let people
have a bit more variety lah
to make their menu more interesting
ya
ya pizza uh
the biggest one
it's very filling
ya
mm
okay
then tomorrow what are you making

going for exchange
other options are
ya can go canada but I don't know if canada have
modules that I can take
there's also
stay in asia

no it doesn't
no it doesn't
no it doesn't cheer up the room
it looks like
mmhmm mmhmm
I understand I understand
all the sentimental values and all that I understand it's just that
why frame it
why
why would you look at it
if you put it in album why would you look at it once in a few years
even if you put
you won't look at it everyday what
it's there but you won't look at it everyday
then then like that
no need to have frame lah
feature wall

ah I need to check again because the last one I check is ah about
two hundred one hundred to two hundred plus ah something like that
one hundred plus why not
okay then maybe two hundred plus
fine then three hundred it is
okay fine then it will
then I find the
why cannot
if I'm not wrong there's a
uh
price for it
so based on that based on that ya based on that I think is about two hundred plus
true
mm
mmhmm
then say lah you put your price like that what
you advertise five room mah
you advertise five room this this price this price and then now you you come then you want to charge more cannot what
one one five
mm
aiya cincai lah cincai lah

mmhmm
but if you wash the sanitisation will wear off
means wash first no no no no
no when we go and check the house we must make sure that they already clean the house
and clean already the house
correct
built-in
okay

mm
wow you want people to scrub some more then you scrub yourself lah
they will have a special
special
ya
hijack
jet spray
that chemical

so ya
wow
oh interesting
um
going into veganism would be fine by me but
I will not go as far as being a vegan because I don't think I can
be a
full time vegan
I think that will be quite hard
there lah almost
into the
vegetarian lifestyle
my opinion is that
selfish
if we keep eating animals
for the sake of our own tastes
okay
mm
but when it comes to chicken or duck
as a pet and we know how
clingy they can be how
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
um
ah mac D that was very selfish
that was one week before new year was it or few days before new year
is
if I were to be a vegan
and mama
mm
mm
vegan
is is there a certain
mm
mm
I
don't have anything
because of all the free time
um
but actually um
in southeast asia
mm
mm
oh my god
mm mm
mm
mm
ya lah
born born to be slaughtered lah basically
mm
mm
and then
oh okay
start drawing again
err two thousand twenty one resolution
err come back to
I
but
by by time
mm
um
but maybe we have to buy a keyboard
I wish that I can
fully depend on working from home lah
ah fully on music then
work from home
the income from working from home is
almost more than performances
mm
um
greek
I I
one or two language first lah before ventured out
mmhmm
oh my god ya
mm
mm
so
okay what what do you want in two thousand twenty one
mm mm
but speaking of two thousand twenty I
a total shit show lah
we we started the year very
very the the very best we can get
not as we expected but
not as not bad at all actually
mm
mm
mm what what is the best thing that
you like from two thousand twenty
ya lah cause we got we get to stay at home all the time
mm
oh but do we really need to buy another laptop
as soon as possible
but I still don't get the
the task
well for that job yet so we'll wait lah
um
what else ah
if you go
the the
ah two thousand twenty one
a burst of
creative contents
this this cannot
um go on for too long I have I have to do something to
mm
K when when when the vaccine is ruled out
will will you be among the first one to
mm
ya I don't have any fear for the vaccine as well
I I don't fear the five G conspiracy
mm mm
natural selections
mm mm
then what else
what what do you predict will happen in two thousand twenty one
mm
it's a it's a paradise for introverts
mm
duolingo
mm
which is very interesting because that happens to us as well
do you miss pre-pandemic
years at all
okay explain yes
mmhmm
mm
mm
fifty fifty
so in a way you just you are a person
who
follows whatever happens
a'ah
mm
mm
excited
I think that it's going to be a bit
hard for me because I am emotionally invested in everything
so
mm
I mean I appreciate the idea of
being a stoic
but to fully embody
the meaning behind the philosophy I don't think I can because I'm a very emotional person
other than stoicism
ah
mm
but nihilism sounds quite
dark and extreme actually
mm
so
in a way
what happens after you die is not your concern right now
because you don't know anyway
think too much about it yes yes
if there is you don't know anyway and if there's not you still don't know anyway
nihilism nature lah
mm
before that among the incomplete workplace to elicit directly explaining their explaining a
but but why do you think about people who
try so hard to make other people believe in their philosophy
I mean they push for other people to believe in what they believe in
because I think
very personal because
mm
mm
mm
so you decide
the next
the next thing
I ran out of idea already
mm mm
I don't have any other interest
and the new age plato
mm
okay
where do you want to go
where europe there's there's a facebook page
called ah the mighty nation of europe where people generalise europe as a as europe and not individual countries
mm
the difference
I want to go to greece again
mm
oh in addition to that scandinavian countries
oh ya ya
sweden
oh yes denmark
K lah hopefully next time
pre-university cause I long for that I yearn for that
euro centric okay my apologies
mm
mm
in ruins
mm
ah you you cannot see with your own eyes
mm
running eh
I mean if if we can if we can reach athens and in three hours wow
wah long silence very long silence
uh huh death to two thousand twenty
but I think it's a good mockumentary lah to sum up
the whole two thousand twenty one eh two thousand twenty
mm
and
mm
okay lah if if you could
be your younger self
mm
you know what do you have against schools ah
uh huh
mm
mm
but for you most of that internet lah kan
I think that will help a lot
ah
mmhmm
this one is the beginning okay
mm very anti climactic
okay lah I like new beginnings um
as to what will happen this year but the bar is pretty low two thousand twenty one the bar is very low
so
well
oh
mm
any wish because it seems to be falling down chip
in a way
because I don't have the power to to do anything about it
um
and
you have yourself and people around you
this year
so you
institution
religion
mmhmm
ah
mm
essence of the story not even full story you can
straight to the point
mm
mm
that's my vaccine wah
mm
mm
ah ah I wish I wish we can talk about something new lah mm
cause otherwise just normal conversation
okay
K lah thank you
okay

but it's not really budget what it's okay lah
ya
it's
in singapore
nobody is going to stare at your body lah
well to be fair since you so paiseh I was like drying my hair so nobody got time to stare at you
so weird and you covered the frosted glass with clothes
so weird
okay we're going to go have like err chicken rice lunch are we still on for chicken rice lunch
ya but we cannot chope seat and it is if if it's like lunch hour it will be
and then the angsty err
no the
are you sure he's the same age as us what
but he work
he even even when you order with your nice friendly face he already serve you that dulan face
annoying sia he's going to give you even more dulan face with the just the eyes he's gonna give you the
no but he is really like
I don't know before we wore mask right it's like constantly you you will like want to scold people with that face with the err I don't know he's but lucky the food nice so that's why people go there like you know ah the person is like the the nephew or eh no no the grandson is not friendly but die die must try the chicken rice so we queue lah
ya ya
ya ya
ya
really
ya because you have to eat and everybody is staring at you from behind you
ya
cannot talk cock during lunch cause everybody is watching but okay lah
we
was it we dabao
no before we came before we ah err
I
ya ya
ya so is like
err what's that called it's nice oh but the indo food there is not bad also after
because she want to step healthy
on anyway recently she started walking ten err ten every night or every day she's trying because that day she went doctor and the doctor say she needs to adjust her cholesterol or there's a possible heart attack in don't know how many years lah so she she scared already err ya
so had try lor try and walk err ten ten ten everyday if not like ya
but I think the funny thing is right I think when you reach that age ah then you look back at your at your food intake
I don't think she's someone who eats fast food leh she
no she has um err high high bad cholesterol
but there's only now what right like
last time he got juggle his intake meh
exercise ah
ya because he works in that kind of environment
no but before that like for the first thirty years of his life not really right
like before this like you now they are forty mah like the first thirty years of his life is like
they got they got like
uh really like watch what they eat or just like
ya that's true
okay that one cannot I I very scared to go for like I'm very scared to go for those kind of checks it's like
ya
but but cholesterol is one thing when if you hit already right you exercise rigorously like crazy right it will still not go down that much
is it's different from phlegm and the amount of fats like cholesterol is really the build up like in your heart vessels so yup
mm
oh he cannot take because of this but he's fit what
ah okay okay
ya
wow okay that is quite sian cause like I see him exercise so much and err workout so much and then
ya sugar sugar level quite easy to maintain one as long as you watch what you eat everyday and like take all the sugar free stuff lah because like even in in coffee tea milo all got sugar what so ya
but I think cholesterol I don't know ah don't know what ya
even if they give you meal plans right is to maintain it like for you to magically lose the
ya
oh shit
you mean all this while he go visit the doctor they never give him meal plan
because my cousin went to the polyclinic right and because they they review her every three months or six months right they actually gave her suggestions you know without her actually requesting for a dietitian they are like okay you eat this eat this at this timing because I think they feel like maybe after the first uh like time gap review right maybe the change not much
so I think that's like why wow there's so much toys okay that's like me digressing but oh ya oh wait I I just side note that day I was eating lunch alone right and there was this lady she was err what's that called ah
with like I think is a vegetarian meal lah so like
no like err there's err you know like those kind that looks like mala but I don't think it's mala it looks like err it's soya sauce so it has like
ya everybody now want to be in err healthy lifestyle err why is it called drink coffee Instagram-mable life
okay and why you making some mentioning names nope
but yes everybody wants to fit in all the healthy healthy lifestyle
no if you don't take photo it didn't happen so you must take a picture to prove that you went to the gym
that's one err ya I think for us when we look at it it's show off right but I think for me I don't do it cause I feel like if you start showing once you have to show more and then
ya and I and then we also realise that we have some friends who like who like workout but then they still eat very sinfully so like the difference also not much so like people will know that's the thing about displaying your life online it's like
if you go out and then like like for example go staycay then you take video then people will be like eh bo jio
no when people when people jio you you not like you will reply what
ya
not you lah I mean like other people people alamak
didn't get it
ya so like that's the thing about promoting like life online lah it's like everybody
but then some people will your life like
crazy it's scary lah if you ah used to crazy people I think you'll be quite scared
ya I think it's just me but yup
ya we are not we're not gonna buy any Rolex to show off but yes after that we err
err
no the dress that I show you the the black and white dress that I show you yesterday
the swiss dot err
aiya
ya ya but but I don't know whether I should buy I've been staring at it it might sold out and then I will regret and then I will be very sian because I miss it ugh
it is it's available but it's like ugh
but I don't know which colour cause no colour nice and like can is those generic colour so it's like aiya
ah yes it must not be cause otherwise
err so it's like must must confirm plus chop must be like for the black one can wear when we go out but then for the white one maybe wear to like wedding
err thirty eight ninety thirty eight ninety the top is thirty four ninety but minus ten percent so it'll be about hundred for three
no I want to buy the top and the white and black dress but it's like a lot ugh
err in the last one month I don't know I mean maybe in october dude now is what month december it's december already
but I buy and can keep mah
same
not not about options or design eh like size like
ya ya
so just suck thumb ah
ya just
no lah it's not that it's not that jialat what
it's still colourful
I feel like now is the time to buy clothes because I feel like if in three to five years err if I settle down I think no such thing as buying clothes so maybe now I should buy
no I I think you really have to rethink it because shag like so many things to pay for like the increase in terms of bills that you have to pay will be quite significant so quite
I
nope shag spend so much money
only choose one ah
for me
I think
no
I think
ya I think the reason why I buy buy clothes is because I feel like I'm the kind if I like it and I can keep it for long I I really can keep it like I have some clothes there like don't know how many years old ya so it's like it's really
I feel lah if you buy clothes and if you can stay stay in your shape
ha not so jialat like expand too much right err then you can wear your clothes for quite a while just need to look after them
ya but then if you buy and then never wear buy never wear then some people buy really a lot
but okay at least I'm the kind who don't buy very expensive clothes but I rather buy more not so expensive ones like I won't buy a two hundred dollar dress I'll buy like three three items for hundred so it's not not so bad
cause people who buy like
very expensive one is like oh my god it's just like too expensive
and it's like
actually
thirty dollar dress and two hundred dollar dress
it doesn't really look
much of a difference
ya
okay
ya and
oh let's go see err universal traveller the winter shop
I don't know where we can just go lah walk down the road are we still going to the rich and good cake shop
yes ah
huh

this one need to clap clap for him cause he just like bring the bike and leave it there I don't know how long already

uh near EXPO like somewhere behind EXPO it's a golf club ah ah err so I was checking when they first open I think the room rates were three hundred plus to four hundred then I'm like that's expensive right
and then I check again it's six hundred six hundred
I mean fullerton bay six hundred is like okay but because fullerton bay is like in the middle of the is it called singapore river ya singapore river or sea whatever lah and err
what's that called
but this one six hundred golf club also got no view okay lah
eh but it's quite near EXPO and all the what's that place called ah changi city point
ya
no it's a is it hotel ya gold club ah ya like resort ah
why as in
uh ya
please lah crowne plaza changi is four hundred fifty for normal room
uh ya but also now no planes fly as in very little not like you can watch
what
but I wanna see cause the room looks nice you
okay I just like then I already see all the hotels in singapore
is like
ya it's nice leh but like aiya I'm not gonna spend that much that much money on one staycay six hundred can get us a very fancy hotel for three nights in thailand so
did we successfully launch the indonesian travel bubble
cause I know the hong kong one they stopped because of the
ya the surge in cases but I think the indonesia one and because I think the once they allow travel business my boss might want us to travel so I don't know
like I think she ya cause we opening the office in and obviously thailand is a standard one lah a
what we opening office in but they're gonna use err they are going to use a section of the generally insurance office to like cordon off and use it lah
but is
it's very slow it's really really slow and like we don't know how whether it's all done or not lah
eh I don't know how they manoeuvre it like I mean like when you open err an office in a country where you don't know anything and the system then someone language
above table under table whatever lah wherever
ya but once we once okay lah not once we can travel but when we can travel we should go to a cheap place in thailand ons
ah okay lah not immediately maybe you have to wait until like err I guess three
three six months after it's clear although I don't think so leh they say leisure
that's the thing that means they under report
no it's like how trump says if we don't do more tests we will not have more cases
so there's
ya
and also for countries like thailand and indo right it's it's worlds apart like the people living in the city and the people living in the villages you wouldn't um like if you don't get tested then okay lah basically you don't have
so it's like okay so it it it's like closing your eyes like okay come I I ah you say you never test okay so you just declare thirty cases okay we clap for you you got thirty cases but really you all are not wearing mask you all are not tracking people you're not you all are not like controlling the movement so
do you really think he has little cases
but in countries like okay technically in lah like it's bad right but I think it's bad in the in the is in the major cities but like
like in places where are you
ya the the the the conservative people like
ya
you know that more than five million people travelled right
I think more than that because also has about what five hundred and twenty million people
that that day pedi said at that point when she talked to me there's at least five million americans on the planes flying throughout the country to visit their family
and then there are some people even on Tiktok you know like Tiktok videos they're like they're like all kinds of people making videos what's so there are I follow a bunch of all these like doctors who make like Tiktok videos about medical stuff like free what to watch so like they um what's that called they were saying like err please do not travel and to minimise the spread ah the healthcare system is really quite drained but they will do it in a dance you know like make it fun that kind of thing but people don't care
they don't care it's natural selection at err it's best no nature selection natural selection
ya correct ya natural selection right because it's like
you you're not scared
but then again singaporeans who are kiasu usually err kiasu kiasi don't want to lose out and also scared die but but also go out and crowding the malls so I don't know
but you will immediately be fined what not meh
chey they were not they were not like removed from our country
I thought it's like quite a high amount and no jail meh like no no jail like
aiya whatever
I mean if you want to make sure people follow then you need to have a more serious
it's like how
the india one ah
no but look at
isn't it like err what for littering or smoking can't they write it's either five hundred or six months jail usually you know on the on the
ya
we have offices and we work in offices and offices not very small what even with the with the alternate grouping it's still more than five what
so you wear mask at all times at your table
ah that's good because
ya we have to wear mask at all times then we even ask like huh but we one person what what if today I'm in the office alone in the as in in the room alone lah I still must wear mask at all times
well
I guess I don't know is just like
that's true have you seen
the rest never mind lah
ya so it's only it's only the it's only the that one
eh the the the khatib new err playground four level you wanna go but then it's like
khatib SAFRA ah ya the one uh jason went the the
HomeTeam khatib HomeTeam at khatib I told you before
uh ya but uh maybe not not when uh got menses
okay that one ons although I think I reach there I will be too scared I'll be screaming
what show your what
climbing away from responsibility but people can always arrow you more
nope once people arrow if people shoot so many arrow you you you
what the hell you you people arrow you at work you skip skip skip
err okay
okay
if you say so
that is not that is different lah I think you next time shouldn't
no
you ya you really cannot spoil market I I think the slightest sign of you caring for them they'll be like oh you're so caring I'm like what the hell
err
but some of it is some of the questions they ask like quite kaypoh what no meh
seriously
okay cause like if if
is it the fat boy anas
see that's why you have all these people writing in on like chinese page about how
not every wife wants to play game what
who is asking who like the
orh it works both ways
no what that's why if both parties have to have their own ah
so they
but
they don't talk during the game there but you
ya so wait you can hear you can hear them talking to their kid in the background while they're playing the game
okay
ah ah
ah
ah
okay
orh ya lah
okay
that is like what okay err
eh but surprisingly leh the SIM card that I got in turkey like when we drove for that god knows how many thousand kilometres it work
ah
ya
ah
ya
huh
okay
ya because the turkey SIM card was not bad leh I
ya you know what my brother tried my brother mind game with like how you play I don't know what he play lah we the a friend in singapore on the freaking van ah
he's like okay I'm gonna try and play games see whether the reception can or not I'm like can't you don't be crazy why you playing game when you're in turkey on the road and he's in singapore
yup so I think maybe you might do that if you go road trip
ya and the reception is terrible what like it will be unstable so like
ya lah you play you play for a bit you sleep for a bit and then you see how it is lah
ya
it's like oh I schedule a pap smear
I think in december I don't remember and also like err what's that thing called ah
flu jab
why ah
oh are they gonna rip me apart
oh
huh
what
no no I went to the toilet
but then again kan when you think about it kan err
I think
I I think
err you know our body has muscles there so technically it can stretch if you not forcing it like to stretch it ah
at your vagina or cervix
okay
okay fine that one government subsidy government government paid a bit right
government should pay full not pay a bit
err oh my god
ya the older people all have lah
oh ya ya the fibroid
right and then after that I'm like
ah
ya ah
everybody thinks like oh this person single mum is it
ya
siao lah
a spotify or
ah
ya
eh I talking about this um
I don't know whether I told you but err so like uh I watched Tiktok videos right so in america teenage pregnancy is very common right
they'll conceive at thirteen
they will give birth at fourteen
but the thing is
ya I like why would you why would you be why would you give birth at fourteen okay lah but I think the is a big country everything is possible
why what you mean what education
maybe people don't have money to buy condom
huh
what if the saran wrap drop out into the person's body
ee but then it has no rubber at the side
ya
so it's like
oh no you did the surgical thing but now you are pregnant
but it's just like I don't know it
err ya is a big country everything is possible not like
not like singapore like you'll be probably damned in like you don't get help and everything
what had he gain
catch ball
next time just catch the ball don't catch the sperm

the exams are like cut off about
exam are replaced with err graded assignments
I just couldn't do anything
even like school related work I didn't even had I didn't even finish my work yesterday ah ah
you design tau like
I know but just I'm I'm just afraid that something I cannot remember I did this and this or did I forget or
but at your internship in the pass there is another someone that intern from your school from your class and someone that you have met before
ya what if I don't have someone like that
ah
hmm
um
but you know what uh I had this one senior the internship was during the period yes so
no
zoom or ah microsoft teams
oh she is uh in human resource
ya but that point of time almost everyone had to
ah work from school even internship eh ah ya from home I mean
ah so like so the only task like
she was given like mostly it was research
and like even but then right
but then during period like almost everyone had to like stop going to work what
but you can still like send your work through emails or something like that what
I mean like most probably like one work one operator ya then have to go to work
have friends like she cannot even make friends like just just in case like and but then um
actually diff races okay lah
what is happening what is happening I don't know a thing but then right in polytechnic I
acquired many skills that I think that if I go to pre-university or
diploma ah outside private school I couldn't I don't have that skills like and I would be still that clueless girl
why like will I like explore these kind of things like
oh my god
oh you mean secondary school or what
oh primary five then I still in the kindergarten lah
youtube game Y eight Y seven Y two
because I think because you had no one to refer though because at least for me right
okay so okay so okay ah
but at that point of time I was
I
messenger
true lah
eighteen oh ya
hmm
why is this class not like taking it seriously
not something to be like
like absent for like out of five days leh
three days absent and and even if he was present
he didn't do anything
uh ya so even the teachers know that ah anytime like they had to
no this is like monitress other student monitor cause the monitor doesn't even come
became the prefect then the useless
they like serious lah
like to be honest for me right
I took
and it was the major presentation and it was like err for my grade it was forty percent
it was during secondary four it was during secondary four but then um
for that grade I got a
then um
I don't know like
all of us became much closer
so but for you
like since you already like from primary secondary diploma in uh
poly diploma in uh arabic private school so
passed by
no I think I was too young to remember that
oh oh ya ya yes
vanguard
vanguard ah vanguard
oh
oh
but then how do they split the class like academic results or just randomly split
ah because for my primary school like
like they like
ah separate into our six six
I don't label myself as antisocial
okay
was it a few people or just like
that one person one girl a group ah
oh she put the blame on you you haven't told me this about it
then what did you do
they put the blame on you
no like do your classmates suspect you as the
oh oh okay okay
oh no
oh
then issac was six
oh primary six oh oh but I thought you had someone who you knew
from primary six
okay
varsity jacket
oh that clip okay
so you had to like
oh
and there was this one time it was the it was the guys ah
I mean like canteen
so suddenly we saw someone running to the school gate
they got
it was a punishment
oh ya
like quite
oh ya
I think because right oh my god
oh the exam is in school
oh my god
at someone else right
no I had the same experience because ah during secondary three or secondary four I help with the book sale
so we had the books arranged at the lah so it was only like the four of us
that that lah
suddenly we were like folding something
oh no we were rearranging books to like
make sure that this section is for secondary one secondary two secondary three secondary four
then suddenly we like
no one is at school except for the admin staff and even the admin staff only no it was the other side
ignore this then we just ah started to talk again lah then we heard it again
eh
oh that is actually something ah
um
oh at that time you just ignore certain things ah ya ya
serious
um
retreat ah retreat
oh okay
oh I remember
it was like the wallpaper like for photos photo booth lah
oh google google
no one no one
err
is at the end of the pasir ris park
I avoid
oh I remember there was this one time okay ah so ah during one of the secondary three secondary four
we had like stay back ah so this was during lunchtime it was on a saturday so lunchtime
toa payoh interchange to buy food so it was left with only like a few people so like around six of us
so we played the was it werewolf or
what colour does this place have the most something like that so we played we played we played so by the end of the ten minutes or something we had to guess lah who is the spy lah
suddenly like all of us like no it's not us it's not us it's not me not me so we played that was like the fifth game so after the fifth game like eh who is it who is it because then we all showed our phone ah none of us is the spy then suddenly
ya it was a mixture of guys and girls lah so so it was like five six of us so we like
how about we go out from this classroom because like even before that right
we heard something lah at in the class it was a second level
so you were like
this one turkish horror movie
ah ah
eh I thought you internship first
oh okay
march lah
february march february lah
february I think february
shaun the sheep
oo ah
the contrast
hide and seek
oh
wait wait
which terminal
what
right now serious
so uh I was sitting beside her actually my my table is like the other end lah
standing
and I asked her lah
okay lah then I ask my friend lah are you sure like is he still there then she say ya from just now like from the thirty minutes from the starting of the class then I was like no can you see him clearly then she say ah
the shadow
eh nat
I cannot see him
then she was like
ah
okay then for that next thirty minutes right I just
but then
that kind of thing happens so I was like okay okay okay I don't want to see anymore then I was like just praying that
window
ya ya um
oh you in that level ah
ya
the corridor ah
oh

uh huh
ah
then what you mean by overs over overstayed your welcome or something like that
okay
okay
so only after that you move back to your parents ah
mm
mm
debate and then eventually you will become unhappy again
like become such a cool mum ah
having disputes ah
ah ah ah
mm mm mm
mm
yes
grow up
ya
tense up ah ah
ya ya
fight ah ya ya
ya ya
like always imposing ah ya
ya ya
ya
a'ah
ah
probably probably ya
mm
you know the the thing that that grown ups don't realise probably we might be the grown ups in the future you know but but one thing they don't realise is that you cannot you cannot apply the same
technique towards everybody like for example okay ya ya ya because why some people you talk nicely it will work some people you force them it will work but maybe maybe she didn't identify that okay you are the kind that I cannot force probably she has to do it subtly I think for you right you are the kind of person if if I based on what I hear lah ah if I'm you're mother I would actually act kindly so that you will feel bad eventually you do it right
why ah what what's the relation bro
okay
ya
ya
but you don't look hard outside leh you look soft outside and inside you are eh fudgemallow you look like a nice guy bro
get hard about it ah
adamant ah
oh okay okay okay
ya
mm
ya I get it I get it I get it ya
ya
probably it's her her adamants her ego also lah
ya
mmhmm
ya eh you know what dude actually what right uh one thing you should actually I recommend lah you go and download this google podcast and then you listen to this book how to win friends and influence people but by right it's a book ah dale carnegie dale carnegie so that actually taught me a lot you know you know why bro because I'm a lot like that I used to actually want to force down people's throat my ideas you know and then I realise that eh no no some people actually uh you you cannot straightaway just jam it down their throat you know different people you have to apply apply different technique lah then that's when I learn and life got so much smoother you know bro it's less there's less fights it's less bitterness it's more positivity you know you learn to compromise and it's such a wah dude my life has been so relax bro for the past few years even though we're going through like financial difficulties or what lah but I don't feel burdened you know I feel like a everything is still good lah
you can listen to the audiobook bro you know remember that time we if you saw the article I was doing foodpanda for awhile it was during the cycling moments that I always listen to the audiobook ah and the other one that I recommend right is the subtle art of not giving an F ah
very rude you know and I I sometimes wonder why can't you be nice yes so apparently it's because it's a psychological thing it's if people naturally in life they just wanna feel accepted important or they want to feel um wanted ya so that is how you know like girls with daddy issue because they never had a proper father figure they just want to feel love like in like a man to love them and that's another another might be because they've been bullied all their life you know so now when they walk the streets they want to walk like there are some gangster like do you know how sometimes the mats can walk like that or the bengs they want to walk like they're so fierce there's actually we should pity them and empathise them you know because they are the ones that actually have issues inside you know
like whoa so big like they as if they got like big triceps ah that cannot close there arm like that
no but it's pitiful though bro because they actually have issues within you know so when they that's why they give a F about these things that doesn't matter like so we should actually learn how to channel our energy on what matters most what matters more what can help help us grow because I also do partially sometimes I help do life coaching also lah ya so when when people spoke to me I will just shift their perspective a bit you know because I can relate you know remember that time I ever spoke to you about you wanting to be a pilot
oh really ah
ya that's why I don't remember which one you're talking about
ya ya ya that was the first time lah ah
opening ah ya and then you told me about your eyesight is it
a'ah then then then
I I think so ah why ah recall recall recall help me recall
oh ya okay okay then then then
oh ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya then then then
oi my memory very bad lah bro very bad bro mm
mm
what do you mean what do you mean I don't understand
ah
ya
ya
okay
something new ah
oo
okay ah
ya ya you can like transfer ah ya
okay
ha
flying ah mm
ah
okay
okay
okay
ya
mm
mm mm mm
ya because in the sky there's so many thing to look out for like a lot of cars what you mean correct there's nothing in the sky what do they need such clear eyesight
look if a plane can crash in the vast sky ah that person should never have been a pilot sia but I don't think this is a matter of eyesight anymore you know this is a matter of how dumb that person can be
ya
oh eventually they change lah when did they change
okay okay
mm
mm ya ya ya
okay
wah motivated like crazy sia
oh very young ah
ah
okay
okay then after that after that
okay okay
uh huh
okay okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
mm
oh okay okay
mm
okay
okay
let go ah
so so okay bro so if let's say somebody say if you have one superpower what would it be you will choose flying ah you would not you would not take super speed lightning speed
but when you have super speed you can flap your wings and fly what okay
okay
okay okay
what
okay okay okay ah
then what do you need
ya but why is it a mistake how did it became a mistake what do you mean
okay
okay
okay
alright
strength ah ya ya ya
oh but but you mean the mistake is not not a mistake in the sense that it affected your career lah it's more of like uh okay okay not not so much of a mistake lah not so much
okay okay
okay then then after that after that after that what happened
which is
which is
ah
okay ya ya ya
holy shit okay and then
holy crap
okay okay
but how does that affect you flying
okay
which is
okay
ah
okay
ah
mm
ya
ya
okay
okay so is that something permanent
okay
holy okay
ya
ya
oh
a'ah
okay
this year you how old
so have you have you started flying yet
you you you did tell me but you never elaborated on that
okay
mm
okay
this was when ah
how you afford all these things man operation lah go lah
you loan ah
okay
okay
okay
so are you still in that
are you still in debt
in debt
ya
okay
oi okay
so you have to top up three hundred so you may have to eventually rent out one room ah
but you're
ya
ah who knows maybe one day I rent with you bro who knows
eh that's not too far
ya ya ya
I I think I know ah it's on the way towards the industrial area right
no ah
just a cross ah oh okay
no you know why because I don't know lah it depends on my future lah because for now there's a lot of changes ah okay okay wait wait
wait wait wait I have no I'm not done about your your story so okay so so after you finish in the so did you manage to fly yes right
dubai right dubai airline is it
oh
so did you really like become a pilot for awhile was it doing okay
experience ah
okay
okay
ya
okay so did you manage to get a local
okay
okay does that pay well
okay okay
that means the pay about four thousand like that lah
ah
then what do you mean drone thing what is this drone thing then
ya it definitely destroyed the plan for a bit lah ya
ya bro ya bro it's one of the worst hit industry lah the airlines
so what what happens to the metal the parts ah
mm
graveyard what happens to the metals they don't try to recycle the metal ah
what a waste of resources isn't there any technology that can actually made use like melt everything or something
mm
wah how many airplanes sia bro like that
wah I never knew this bro if I never spoke to you
so so wait just to recap a bit so you mean the the part where I I spoke was basically just giving you another avenue lah like from steward to be flying lah okay okay
ya ya ya ya
ya ya now that you tell me everything right everything is uh my my memories coming back I remember you did update me about the hernia thing actually ya you said you ya ya you told me you by right supposed to get the job already but then ya
oh you went through the three months ah oh it was supposed to be that stage already lah oh
wah dude that time if you fly ah your inter pretty stable and nice ah bro four to six K easily sia
there will always be a road there will always be a road
just waiting for the right time to strike ah
ya ya
walao I don't think that's anywhere close sia
I know but the feeling that you know remember that when you say you fly that feeling you I you totally not there sia on the drone
okay
that's relatable lah
ah okay okay so it's just a matter of time lah
ya man ya man it's like a movie beginning you know like I visit you at the hospital and then this is a story of mumammad salihin
ya then eventually when people see the peak ah lah it's because he cannot become a pilot his obsession eh but okay lah but you know what what thing I I respect about this right what okay okay you know normally people always say they want something but everybody wants it you know but nobody is willing to put in the effort like crazy because I think what you're doing is really really
ya like for you you are like oh crap I cannot do this nevermind I find another way you know I find another way cannot I find another eventually asylum lah so ya but but but no lah I I wish you all the best ah brother I'm I I'm sure I'm sure eventually you gonna get it lah it's just a matter of whether you become a commercial pilot or you know it's just a matter of which field oh
mm
ya ya and they're not they're not containing it well right until now
you mean trump
you know you know one the the only silver lining I see right about him being in power it's the war in middle east is not intensified like he didn't press on it too much because before him ah ya like before him right you see bush wah everything he attack clinton no time also they have a bit here and there obama got nobel peace prize but he also did a lot of damaged in middle east you know but trump like when you hear about him ah the like almost not involved in the middle east man
he's a selfish businessman lah
ya
ya ya
but but that's the thing though his his narrative always make people become violent for example ya ya ya
ya that's true in fact there's more racial attacks ever since he became president according to statistics ah in the ya in the
he's he says without filter
unwise
no lah bro
I don't know to be honest if you really look back eh okay obama is a cool president I mean in terms of it's swag his charisma I'll give him that lah but but what do you mean substance I've watch his speech he just basically speak things that are vague like all presidents do his I mean presidents they don't really they don't really talk about policies you just say things like we will do this way we will and now I know in the united states you know I mean dude he has charisma but substance wise is definitely better than trump but but
I mean like every president at the end of the day they're just a figurehead mah like democrat or republican they're controlled by those who pump in money to campaign them which is that eventually the banks what the corporate world you know it's the it's the ones that are really ruling everything is the one who do the lobbying
you know which is the the rich people lah the the the government doesn't matter whether you're a president from their own credit or republicans it because why they work in the congress level the senate level like even if let's say the the president's a democrat if he cannot get a bill passed the republicans the the the bill cannot go through you know so so eventually nah honestly okay this is my take people might think democracy right is actually the best system you know what's my take my take it doesn't matter whether you're monarchy you're communist your dictator your democrat or whatever as long as your leader is corrupted net no system will work because why bro you wanna talk about monarchy at one point of time we have empires that are great bro that the kings and like cleopatra and there's julius caesar I mean they're great huge empires
you want to talk about dictatorship that kind of concept we have genghis khan you know of course they were violent people you know but they were strong as as as as a nation amongst them lah you know and then you have communism you wanna see communism is bad china is the strongest country right now you know I mean the only plus point that I see when it comes to a democracy is that um people just have space to voice out things
and she's damn humble bro damn humble you you see and the vibe is I mean we don't know them in person lah how political game works you know they say politics is a dirty game you know no doubt I don't know how she managed to pull it through but she definitely does not give off a vibe like she's means bad things for people
dude I planning to do that but the thing is not now lah because if I go there I will die of boredom sia
don't have don't have but I'm half new zealander so I'm trying to I'm trying to get my my father there or something lah but I'm not in touch with him that much lah
ya but I I only met him like once you know so I never really I don't know how to get this through but retirement only when I'm old lah I only plan to go there when I'm old
ya like maybe when I'm above fifty right or fifty five where I just do not want the concrete jungle anymore when I just what nature grasslands or fountains ah then maybe I'll migrate but for now bro I cannot handle the boredom lah there's nothing to do sia there
like what bro like what imagine you have to drive one hour before you go to a place that has any form of entertainment which is closing at five you tell me what you wanna do
ya you you when you get that kind of money you let me know lah okay
you know or not so we it's not I mean it's doable I'm not saying it's not doable but if you ask me to do now how sia
a plan ah
you know so and and lately I've been going into a lot of the I'm going back into the financial wisdom I'm learning a lot of the all the money matters things so
the current business lah oh I I with edudebt you can google edudebt so edudebt is basically a is a debt solution centre we do not we do not administer loan we do not touch your like your money to your loans or whatever no lah basically okay whenever client come to us we will present to them the all the possible means for them to clear the deaths in singapore available in singapore okay right so for example okay lah I will just give you a brief verbal presentation ah people we will educate them on bankruptcy okay okay like for example oh bankrupt people so scared but when you ask them why oh why okay like example you suddenly you why you why you scared to be a bankrupt
ah
but when you bankrupt you don't really have to pay much mah
like what
okay assume you're somebody with a home already
even if you use bank loan to buy under they have a different law to protect your house for bankruptcy
they will just cut your utility lor
ya
so if you times that by five years sixty months he ends up only paying like less than twenty K for his debt of hundred over thousand alright so within that five years yes you five years plus another five years cooling period you are not allowed to take loans and credit card but okay lah you already in debt what for you want to take more credit card and that exactly so for people like say the ideal bankruptcy right is you already got a house renovation all done everything all done you know
do not be surprised
bro what if the okay okay okay these are these are that these are bad people lah okay you know why they use they they they manipulate the system which is not good it's like what you know it's like a legal loophole it's not a it's not a crime but if they play it right it's like a loophole lah which is why the the the whole stigma if you go to website right they will try to get you like okay bankruptcy is terrible
okay I give you I give you a scenario I give you a scenario okay let's say you have a company for a few years the company does very well and then you apply company loan so it's under the company right the loan you are you are the guarantor lah okay so now because of the good track record the better track record you have the the more loan the bank will have you because you're low risk mah you're good you're good pay master credit take over okay let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollar loan lah okay and then we get two hundred thousand probably you buy like other assets lah you know you buy Rolex lah you buy a car but when you buy you don't buy under your name
you buy under your wife you buy under your mum for example you you register their name when you purchase right okay so imagine now now the money that you have been using is disbursed everywhere anywhere except under your name and then you apply bankruptcy the assets are still there mah
they can trace but it's not a crime
ya
ya bankruptcy they will pull your assets registered to your name which is why which is why they they there are people who are cunning out there you know so of course we cannot condone these actions lah your your you know banks they might be banks they might be rich but this is ethically wrong lah but there are people who does that bro
so they like for example ah they get like two hundred thousand they put some amount in the alike something that they can sell back for a good price probably invest in gold under your wife that kind of thing you know then when that they apply for bankruptcy they end up not paying two hundred thousand they pay less
you just have to pay the monthly that the one that the government uh supreme court order you to pay lah like three hundred a month five hundred a month bank about five years to nine years five to nine years only bankruptcy after that the five year cooling period
that means you cannot take loan your your credit rating is under under the the negative zone lah that means you cannot okay you see if you are a good pay master you get double A rating that means it's easy for you to get any loan it's easy for you because you've been a good pay master if let's say you skip once a while you get double B so there's a whole rating system the moment you hit or bankruptcy right
they have to stay in singapore ah
cannot ah
their their their passport is blocked what they cannot
ya so but you can travel if you pay your monthly and you submit your form to your
but you have to do it ahead lah you cannot like ad hoc suddenly you wanna go lah you know
ya
and then the third thing they said cannot get a job cannot get job subjective most probably government will not hire you uh they cannot lah they will not hire you and probably if you apply for executive job okay lah they also don't wanna hire you
because they you remember when you apply job they will have to tick yes or no bankruptcy ah so for executive level okay for example let's say they want to hire you as a general manager you can't even manage your own finance you wanna manage company so the will do their check but if you let's say you want to work pest control you want to do Grab Panda or you know you wanna you wanna you wanna uh work in production houses if the company feel like eh there's nothing wrong with hiring a bankruptcy then they can hire you lor private entity what
ah so at the end of the day now you understand bankruptcy better
limited limited ya because some company they are very particular for example right a financial adviser once applied for bankruptcy he lost his job because he's a financial adviser he cannot be bankrupt
ah like this kind of job ah the one that is got profile one ah they normally will not hire you one
ya ya so now now okay people don't understand but these are the things that normally we try not to tell people because we don't want them to manipulate the system lah ya and then second then the second the second mode of payment how to clear your debt is you pay the minimum sum
ya interests ah
ya lah for example okay I give you a scenario ah let's say you owe ten thousand lah the rule of banks is normally three per cent minimum you have to pay so in the case of ten thousand you pay three hundred lah
so now balance supposed to be nine thousand seven right but don't forget credit card or bank loan standard is about twenty four per cent parallel which is two per cent per month lah okay
exactly which every year about sixty to seventy thousand singaporeans fall under this trap they call it the financial uh the debt trap ah okay so the second way is to pay a minimum eh

just now what time did you wake up
eight so early
I was still sleeping
actually I just woke up lah
uh ya

oh you suggest me to eat at Adam's Corner there
wah
then what what do you suggest me eating there
water chestnut
so actually you go botanic garden what do you do cause personally
I don't really like going there lah cause more of nature so many insects
I um my sister she used to lah she used to be be a photographer
but now she's
she she she has been following like you know like the like production all
but she's not really into the like
camera thing but she's more on the like
helping the set up the scene or like more and becoming a producer but she don't really hold a camera anymore now
set up the scene or like more on the becoming a producer but she don't really hold the camera anymore now
you can watch if I'm not wrong is after the
news if I'm not wrong lah
ya
if you don't watch news I don't even watch
after that you have to go to school already then go home have to do like assignment for tomorrow class
like sometime I feel like I'm even too busy to even like
look at my social media and all all I do is just like text people and just do my like go on with my day
and then just sleep wake up and just repeat
I don't think that's what we do I think that's what you do I guess that that's what you meant cause I don't get that privilege of like
if you not a if you just like um afternoon person then how you go school so you always miss school or late for school haiyo
huh
wow I was shock
you start at eight but the latest you come at eight on time
but next time try lah try to be on time lah it's school it's important
me graduate
I started school err this year april
so it's only been how many months
uh few months I think like I mean like
a quarter way there
still long time so still got
two years more left
hmm looking at myself right now
I don't think I'm able to continue until degree I think
diploma is enough I but I don't know maybe the future will change
how I feel about studying will change so we'll see how but
for right now I don't think so lah
then eh you you don't want to like get like full time diploma you want to work instead
oh
I don't think that's a good way of thinking because you need to know nowadays they all ask for like minimum diploma
like it's best is actually if you have diploma instead
like then if also you take full time it's at least subsidised by government you can take all
so you don't like taking part time diploma will be much more expensive actually
so think better think properly before you decide to actually just
straight away get into the career path you know once you get in it's hard to get out
ya sure glad to be your friend
mm I actually joined netball but for like one month only then after that
I quit I join guitar
but
like I join guitar until when like I'm like sec four but I don't know how to play guitar I don't know what I do inside
also
then how about you you do you enjoy like your during secondary school
wow then the this club are you like serious or just like
you know like just a leisure thing
uh that time I heard you got injured because of rugby right then like for a long time you did not
get to play rugby although it's your hobby
uh no I take care of myself very well
um like luckily you know I'm not that sporty person
ya I'm more of just like
chill relax don't get yourself in trouble kind of girl
trying to find ways that can injure yourself
but it's okay lah since now also you
you didn't break a lot of bones right I believe hopefully
in another ten years
are you sure
but it's okay you can try but as you grow older there will be more commitments
oh really are you sure you don't have I thought you have a girlfriend already
oh good lah
hmm nevermind lah
like
right now oh you heard about like
uh I I thought I think I heard like they moving into phase three or or was it just fake news I'm not so sure
like I know it's like for safety purposes but it it hurts to be wearing it for like
twelve hours straight the whole day
but you can just like
make sure that thing don't happen by wearing contact lens right
oh
it's okay lah we just we just pray like things will get better like
this COVID will go away soon cause like I think it's almost a year already now
uh I really
the safety measure like the government has put out
are you sure you do that
it's good lah you playing a part to help like singapore a safer place like
like let's make it like by next year it's free from COVID
wah I really I like oh yes just now I remember you asking me like if COVID ends what I want to do right
actually the first thing I want to do is I want go karaoke like I don't know uh
like before COVID I used to go karaoke like at least like at least every month
ah every month but now
like I heard like like I heard rumours that they want a close down Teo Heng
oh wah everything you want to do with your friend ah then how about like your girlfriend or your family you don't want to do anything with them is it
oh uh you heard talking about like and all you heard about like
uh government giving out the hundred dollar the singapore I think the singapore discovery voucher if I'm not wrong
like like but I'm not so sure lah but like what it can be use for
only like certain
I'm sure there's like partnership like certain places only they accept if I'm not wrong I think if you go to places like like singapore attraction I think
like I think like the singapore zoo or you can use
but
if I'm not wrong I heard from my friend they say cannot
you cannot combine your vouchers like and and you you told me like just now you can staycay right
relax what you so stress about
wah talking about staycay before COVID also I used to staycay a lot with my family
but now but now actually the hotel is actually cheaper
but cause they only like
you it's already a like limited number of people can go and then you can't even use the swimming pool like
at one time only a max of I think like
four person can go inside the pool
if not you have to like uh allocate time for every guest
ya I guess we all now like hope like life could go back to normal
but in order for life to go back to normal it's also it's it's our part to play to make things better like
to avoid
COVID to spread more ya so let's try our best to do that
so we can have what we want
swim oh uh have you like you know uh sentosa also there's a lot of like
uh activities to do like the luge or the bungee jumping have you tried before
height I've tried a lot of them that I mentioned actually
uh oh I used to work at luge actually I've I find luge
it's fun like it's fun you can like take this car right you can go down like different
uh trails
there's a lot of tourists that keep coming back
because uh apart of singapore I think there's one at new zealand there's also one at korea
but their like bigger country got longer trails but singapore is more of like the I think the shortest trail they have
but you still can get to experience the same lah
but isn't roller coaster better like you like you can just end it within like a minute
you see the longest roller coaster also like I think how many minutes only
is like you you just have to close your eyes for a while then you you already finish especially the one at I think the is it the human one
ya it's like really fast
then you want what the roller coaster just go straight line is it
uh I think might as well you just take a train
I guess for you lah
ya maybe some things are not meant for you to do but if not you can always go to other country to try and experience it
are you sure
like
K maybe you can try lah I don't want to like crush your dreams you know
wow that must be fascinating to be as a child to know like every car brands huh
wah then what's your favourite car
but I'm just not into it like you know like
like there's interest in car no I like car I mean it
I can sit down it gets me to places with shelter
oh then you watch tokyo drift ah you like japanese car
oh the fast and furious movies is it ya actually tokyo drift all uh
is it is it too fast too furious or the fast and furious one oh I think just anything before that is nice but after
I don't like not really into the show lah
way before what don't so text me just saying you watch the show when there's paul walker
so when there's no paul walker you don't watch it anymore
nissan skyline
oh I think I heard of that car before
wah but I don't know lah I I'm I look so weird by myself like I don't have like interest
but it's weird you don't know like people always have like will be interest in cars interest in bikes
or interest in like footballs and all
ya I'm amazed that like
wah so you have been supporting that club since you were three years old
wow
I feel like that's against your will
but it's okay I guess you learn
you grow to learn the eh eh you learn to grow
hais
english is hard but it's okay I think you love your club already but is your club really good actually or you just love them
but is man U still as good as they were
wah wow
but I know lah like I like I used to hear like man U is like good but now
I don't really hear much about them anymore so like
I don't know anything but it's
cool to know lah from you
true lah you also cannot expect all good players to go into man U right of course you have to give chance to other teams to bring up their name also
are you being an haters right now like maybe right now it's liverpool time to shine
hmm interesting wow
wah I feel like wah I'm not looking forward for work tomorrow like
uh ah I also just want to relax and really just watch something I like
true
hais
nevermind I think we just have to endure a bit
get through this hard time then maybe when we're
things are easier
then we can just
enjoy life already
ya I agree
is it
rain before sunshine
but just a bit more let's let this COVID pass and then we can get back our good jobs
mm mm
ya can't wait can't wait to get like
uh like a good career and then can start saving and then we can do like we say like travel
and do the things we want
ya but it's okay lah let's just think positively for now
no need to think so much
we just do our part we focus on our
career or our education
then I'm sure things will be better for us

four bars
oh my god the parking the parking can pay off my bike instalment babe I swear
is still the best option if you're still just a couple
I don't think I can sustain a fucking car
it's crazy
but I think it's just cause of the transport lah like the ease of transport he was thinking since you are only allowed to drive cars
regulars eh
is there like no place that he can appeal to or write to
that's bullshit eh babe
oh my god
oh right oh no
full
to get on
but I mean of course ah simon I'm sure simon feels bad about it like he wants you to

like there's
okay I mean at least that's stable like that
that's a stable plan
ya ya ya it's safe
mm mm
oh all civil servants ah babe like that

ya
right so you have to save money right
ya
ya
oh right

right
annual wage supplement thirteen month

but like the celebration the
right right
uh uh ya
oh you should ask them to ya
ya

the event organiser like which is them lah since they're catering for the food
ya for fifty pax eh
positive ya
like you will be held responsible ya
huh
ya
but you didn't sign right babe
ya
ya

it's not like one week before the wedding that this happen they did not buy any like
like utensils their like equipment is all their stuff
ya
oh are you serious
are you serious
can transfer to other people or not
like ya sell your package to someone else
oh
why you still continue to pay sia babe
right
oh my god babe that's a lot of money sia
it's not it's how can a person like how can if you want talk about economy right how can you put uh a company's precedence over an individual
like you want to say that oh because company also need need to earn money how can you put that over a an individual's loss
they never even spend anything
there were no losses
ya you didn't get any of the products
wah I will angry sia
ya
oh you know you know he's so cute he was like when are you going to be my girlfriend like officially my girlfriend
err like a couple of weeks ago cause I tell him like by default I feel like we are boyfriend and girlfriend
I still have this need to officiate it
and then he was like okay at the end of the year
ya ya
at the end of the year cause like he says that he wants me to focus on school and work like he doesn't want me to worry about this
so I was like I guess can take it as a test like I don't know like just wait it out and observe
get myself there and tell myself like I'm in a relationship
never I never tell him this yet
ya
he doesn't spend like he really saves you know like he can really save money and like that's one thing that I like admire about him lah he's very responsible spender so like he saying that he has already started saving money then I was like oh
just like
I think it's quite cute lah like how sure he is of me
ya
you know like he told me right um the last girlfriend ah he never they never officiate the relationship like after a few months of dating she was like you're my boyfriend right and then he told me like in after one month less than a month of me and him like seeing each other he he felt so sure of me that he wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend that he ask me directly you do you want to be my girlfriend I was like oh so like to him it means a lot lah that he ask me then I was like orh okay
then
ya
that's why he says he's really sure of me
um also like I feel like honestly deep down I still have unresolved issues you with hassan
me I still have unresolved issues with hassan
ya we're still not talking tau babe
happy happy birthday
never wish me then but they bought me a cake
they they bought me a cake at nine then they say we waiting for you to come home to cut cake but actually I went sleepover wah I felt like the shittiest daughter ever sia babe
but it's okay
ya ya ya they bought me a cake
so like that's the thing there's so many like ah loose threads or like uh consequences on some like those aftermath of me and hassan that I'm still trying to figure out because I don't want to go into a new relationship with aqil and have like all these things unresolved like if I want to be with aqil I want to be with aqil only and not have like oh this is because of hassan that's because of
like what happen in the past and all that
then on like on the low key I still care about hassan like sometimes I wonder like is he doing okay and all that
I
take care of himself
I think so ah because like he was a great boyfriend sia babe only things things messed up after the relationship
I went through a lot of shit
for the past like couple of years like since last year ah
and to be honest right I'm so glad it happened because I got to meet you
like I really felt that way sia babe like
like the thing with hassan all that shit that went through like I went through with the other guys like
I will go through it a million times knowing the fact that I'm going to meet aqil and this is going to happen
ya
how things play out
ya but it's just like only time ah babe only time will tell like the outcome of with me and aqil
okay
thank you babe like you just
factory restore it's not on my laptop it's on my phone and you just delete everything
but I have some things that I want to keep like myself and friends
ya I don't know ah like
I mean I really really hope hassan
everything will work out well for him because I really still want him to be happy he deserve happiness ah babe he's a good guy
I mean during the relationship lah after that I don't know what happened
right
uh after after hassan
cause you were still with audi and then like we went out remember you me hassan you me hassan audi ya
ya
honestly right I have this theory that sometimes like people suppress their true colours or their true form and they become someone else that they think that the partner like prefers ya and then when things don't work out their true form like comes back
like you think you know someone until like they don't have feelings for you anymore and then you will really know who that person is
I feel so eh babe
uh like when he was with me he was like before me he was very like um cold like he's very err like
ah very action ah
like he's a very action person I feel like it's because it's like it's like defence mechanism like it doesn't let anyone in he doesn't he's not friends with just everybody like he picks his friends very picky with his friends and then like uh when me and him started hanging out he became more friendly he become more open and more like outspoken and all that
and then err he became less judgemental
and then when we start we stop like being in a relationship we broke up he became that person that I kinda saw in the starting of the relationship
so I'm just like then I wonder ah like how long can a person actually suppress themselves like what if you get married to this person
be someone that they're not
then their true form comes out wah scary ah
deep talks okay where's the malay lines let's put in some malay in here
ah
okay
like that would be
babe thailand the best place ya
oh ya you went with your family right
that's nice
I tell my parents I go with you
huh
ah ah
oh right
ya not your thing okay okay I get it
oh my god
bangkok is it
I think it's bangkok right
like
sorry
no lah I think you you and simon should have your time first
you guys should go bali sia babe
no like bali is is accepting like tourists at the end of the year
so you should like
eh they have they have like private villas with pools and like nice nice ass views and the food's pretty good I think you should check it out
it's just like for maybe like three nights lah you just have time for each other
just lepak with each other
oh my god they're gonna transcribe this
ya like typing it out like okay so miza um said she and aqil colon
oh right we can like
ya
I think it'll be fun
then ah
ah ya the the they were in the lot and then like aqil saw them then aqil was like eh and then he park near near their lot in their lot
ya
we bought like err Decathlon chairs so like we would like sit outside and just like look at people
huh
no he doesn't like because he sweats easily
he is a good guy
ya
ya
ya
mm
like his jealousy
but as long as you know how to be loyal in a relationship and you know boundaries that's what's important to me
firdaus is an idiot
ya
you know
we got seven more minutes
how about yours
ya same
but honestly like I I'm also like
I'm also quite scared to introduce aqil to my family you know like that's that's one of the biggest fears
ya his parents is not like didn't bring him to like classes or like
you know
I feel like kinda is you know why because he doesn't have the he didn't grow up with the basics
so it's kinda hard to like
I don't want to push him I don't want I want you to like you know but one thing that kinda made my heart melt a bit was that day he was saying that he wants to talk like he's not scared of meeting my parents
but he doesn't pray he doesn't know how to pray doesn't know how to like read stuff
okay I mean I don't want to be that girl who's like oh my husband has to be no I've never been like that I always feel like it's a joint effort like it has to be the both of them
and then sometimes I feel like aqil like morals also questionable
like he ah he's okay to drink he's okay to like
do stuff
but
then he will like judge people who who do that also
that's your opinion but
to me I've always been a to each their own kind of person like
ya
ya
right
mm
your mum
ya
eh how's your mum is she okay
err I think december
like I would ask him to meet my parents first before we plan for what's ahead
and then
uh
most likely early next year
or mid next year
but I told him ah like my is enough to tank the down payment
so he's like oh no lah but like he wants to
then I say it's fine um like we can like plan lah like
try to understand and see other people's view ah like I feel like that makes it that makes him someone very easy to work with

err my day today was okay it was quite a slow day uh
because I didn't do much uh today
um I got up got some coffee
then
I open my computer
watch some YouTube videos
and then I tried to update my resume
resume for my resume for work lah
I haven't actually applied for anything
err I was there was this err job link that adli sent me
it's from Apple
ya the phone the phone Apple
err
err annotation analyst
at least if I remember correctly lah but then there was an addendum to the title
that said uh it was uh
malay language specialist
basically just listen to
and then
transcribe them into
words ah
then I think I think most of the audio would probably be in malay I think it's for Siri
err natural language processing
feel
which is more concern with err and machine learning
where the
the itself
actually err learns language
or whether it's completely nurtured
ya
then err
so
so ya lah the I think they want to do that on two fronts
the first is to figure out
ah yes I will be part of that
a'ah
soon lah in a few days lah I want to see no I want to see if they can actually I can actually just apply with my current resume
so like
I got no results
the
err
so far no uh except for a few that I saw err
err wherever lah I think there's a few locations
no like err I I meet the requirements ya
mm
okay lah the exam was
ops management which was just basically a lot of maths
and err second language learning
which was basically all theory
so it was quite easy uh
the best eh
probably second language learning
huh why
no uh because it's like I mean it's rooted in theory what so it's more difficult to screw up
ya ya I just want to pass
mm ya
your leave
mm
mmhmm
hmm
wait pause they made you take
a test
ah
skewed biased
I mean the name of the workshop is strength training eh
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya your boss's boss
ya
mmhmm
huh how come your computer shut down in the room
oh so the
so basically the zoom thing crash lah nothing wrong with your computer lah
okay okay good
whoa
okay uh
I sat in the chair
but it's okay lah I mean I managed to
err get the most out of my studying
no no difference
ya I got all the info I needed
like
the
the only issue was err
that one maybe I could have spent some time going over the actual books and where the quotes were
as in like I know
can I know the story I know everything then I just need to know how it goes and then I just pick and choose the parts that I want ah
I mean
no I went for the english aspect
not for the lit
ah
then he suddenly appears
but what
jaden smith
your your crazy midnight shift eh
mmhmm
oh
ah
mm
so
so basically there was no person in charge lah for the thing
wah co in charge lah
on the ups
mmhmm
mmhmm
after six
oh okay
oh
oh okay okay
ya
hmm
so he's new
ah
mm
oh
wait
cannot say cannot say
confidentiality
eh to whoever's listening
confidential okay
mmhmm
the what thing
oh okay
ya
mmhmm
mm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
yes
like why they put you in the same crazy shift again
mm err on the days you're schooling
mmhmm
oh okay
ya
ya
okay shift is what time to what time
you
oh you cannot request for shift change eh
oh for your class eh
eh I think I destroyed your chair
oh okay
ya
but
but wouldn't it be nice to have like a new shift
like no more normal timing
it feels feels like
it feels like you've been on this shift
for like
at least a year already
because like everytime like
you have to sleep like so early at night then wake up so early
it's
ya
ya because like
your
mm
ya
ya
or see people first
and then go to work at night
ya
so there's like no time basically
mm
ya
mm
I think you felt the same way in that
take a break if that makes sense
mmhmm
oh shit serious ah
mm
ya
mmhmm
justin bieber
oh
oh they are not big fans of justin bieber
mm
have different workflows eh
so like the process itself also is like completely different is it
oh ya lah
you better do it
ya
serious ah
mm
ya
but then it's a bit
it's a bit err
weird
like
there's no
that's tough so like every new client that you shift to
it's like an entirely new learning curve for you uh
the previous shift
complacent ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
I don't know uh I think
honestly to me
like just get the job done get it done and over with and then send uh
in what sense
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh
ya
mm
wait
okay
mm
mm
a'ah
ya like you
mm
mm
oh ya
and I think like you want other people to step up also right
a'ah
mmhmm
ah
ah
jaded
mm
oh okay
I was actually going to make a joke
ah okay lah
mm
wait pause it's like we're having a conversation
with a third people listening in
but there are only two people
who are physically present here
no
huh
ya ya they know we we also know
if there was no recording between us it will be like okay but now the opportunity presents itself for us to share
our knowledge and our language with a third person
no there's like there's like a
like home wrecker eh
no no there's there's
ya there's
no now that one person has more uh
malay vocabulary to transcribe
ya ya
I don't know uh but see like the the the thing is the thing is when I'm talking to you right now
kan it is
I I feel like I adopt the same cadences
as if I was talking to the person who is listening to this
ya
so I think it's fine ah it's not like I put on any ass for the camera
what kind of conversation that you can I think it should be acceptable lah
aiya
ah
a'ah sia
ah ya lah of course lah it's their job
just anime like
are we allowed to swear no right
okay okay
I will try not to swear
I've been watching um
err Fire Force
old
it's new it's twenty twenty
it's twenty nineteen and twenty twenty
basically a fire fighting force
but the fires that they fight
are magical fires
and they have magical powers of fire
and then there's some conspiracy thing behind it that I think you will like
because you like all these weird conspiracy things right
no no spoiler because
err
err there's two seasons
now second season ongoing
ya
ya Evangelion
Evangelion
maybe add three or four months
ah ya
in japan
oh
but mm
ya but then like I wonder what the logistical issue would be in importing the movie over to singapore not much right
it's just the digital transfer of the thing right
just send the raw digital file ah
cloud
oh ya ya
but wait
there are no more there are no more actual physical films that are screened right in singapore most
that's the only one ah
I feel like the projector also uses digital now
they should have like some sort of niche hipster kind of place where they screen film like that
artefacts
but but then again
with the film itself you are not restricted to resolution
the reason why there's no lord of the rings in four K
either ten eighty P or fourteen forty P or something ya which was the maximum resolution at that time in two early two thousands uh two thousand one to two thousand and four
the actual film
like
err like
for example now you take the film camera right then you film something outside
you are not limited to resolution that means you can just render the thing in four K when you when you download it and edit it digitally but
the thing is at that time with lord of the rings
they they filmed it most of it on film
or like something someone would draw in paint
I don't know why for some reason when I laugh very hard on this thing through my nose
then it clips the recording
like
like the kan the thing become red right
ya that's clipping I think
ya but
but
speedy speedy
ya
ya
I want to make a film you got camera right
you got camera right
just film any wait I write I write the script
I write the script
then
err
can I direct also
obviously no I think you can you be you be
no you director of photography
basically
huh
I mean you have an eye for the frame what
and then after that you will get like
what there's a
I think there's a like different terms for different things uh like
behind ya that kind of shot ah
mm
A U T E U R eh
a'ah
auteur
ya
but
err anything ah can also uh
just just put for me whatever order you think is nice
but ya I think I think can can be done
but I feel like
I have the image
in my head
but I don't know
flexible
in what sense
mm
okay ya
mm
oh to get ah ya ya I mean I mean
it might
no no
but I think
if I were to write
a movie
confirm I will write it
in
bearing in mind at the back of my head that there are
budgetary and err location locational constraints
ya
anything mix also can
drama
I think I will try to go by genre first
probably be a psychological drama
like something that makes you dig deep inside your head ya
it's like that's that's the only thing that I actually want to achieve
but in terms of the story
but with
a
psychological uh age not twist ah like psychological age that really examines the human psyche
because I feel like that's what that's what movies are all about ah
that looking into the
err
quite a few actually
Handmaiden was good but it's not
okay ah stimulating ah but it wasn't like
it's like in what I have in my head is halfway between an art film
and a sci-fi film
it's like um
like you know Annihilation
ya that that that's like I think one of the
the best
because it is
it is the movie
telling you to to look inwards
but
but it doesn't explicitly tell you what it is that you need to be looking for
ya and err
jurassic park also is another one
no but the the thing the thing about jurassic park is
no it's not it's not nostalgia the thing the thing that I love about the original jurassic park the first one not the Lost World
err three was a mess but I just watched it for fun
is like it is an
ethical dilemma
discusses
within the movie itself discusses power roles
it's like as humans
you know we have this power
and then it's no longer a dilemma
by the time the movie rolls about
because the humans in power have exorcise
sorry exercised
that option
and now they are no longer the ones in power
ya
ya ya correct but like
it it
through
err power
you know and like
a display of real fear
ya
like that's the one's like there's true fear man
ya
directors you know director damn smart
err
let's see
ah the wailing
the wailing
it's like
you are like the the other person is
what you want to see in that person so like whatever that person does it
to an extent it doesn't really matter
because it's like all you know within you see you see that's like that's the kind of thing like I want to get and the wailing was like
between
horror supernatural sci-fi and an art film
mm
ah
ah
ah
ya and then like like
are they are they just what you would like to impose on them
mm
I think I think they
go to the house
ya
mm
oh ya ya a'ah
mm
I don't know I I cannot I cannot remember that particular detail ah
all the gloomy gloomy scenes where like they make the people like really small like to show like you know how
it's like it is significant like you and your thoughts are significant in the way that
it impacts the view of the world around you but at the same time you're also insignificant like what
just being nice
I don't think you were with me
was it was it the
oh ya that's okay okay we watched that one
we watched that one in the cinema uh
nevermind ah
I think that one will I probably will have to watch with rehan lights off speakers on
oh
mm
ya but
I think the easiest step
is to write the script
make the script as perfect as we can and then we can edit it along the way
nope
I can just I can just wing it ah
eh I got A you know don't play play you know
director of photography ah
written and directed by then I put my name
I just want to see that
what
ah
no you know no
no lah we do it we do it properly lah but I I just want to see like
one of my dreams aside from err getting
uh machines to learn language on their own
is to have a film
and then it says written and directed by
ya that's it
oh ya
no need ah low budget ah indie
live what
no lah it's like an aside thing it's not like it's like you know like we spend
no lah
we put I mean yes I'm going to put my whole heart and soul into it but when I'm free lah
ya no no no
or we can do it every other weekend
try to film as many scenes as we can in one weekend
oh ya correct correct
okay lah then when we on our off day then we do ah
I think can can no worry can be done
oh ya also I think I might be actually getting the expensive
not anytime soon lah
like next year
uh my hot ah
then like it's not keeping up with the fourteen forty P
your card okay right
no as in like
it's not like
lagging out in games or what
ah whatever game you can try you try ah
mm you never try Borderland three
buy ah
for the for the release price lah the release price is sixty bucks I think
then then this black friday eh
what you buy
oh ya
oh ya later ah later
masks
yes
compress
okay lah
oh okay
huh
I want to I want to take one
nezuko
then why do you order two
ya why you order four
you
you keep it in rotation ah
ya lah so you rotate those masks also one
why no fear
ya as in
no the thing is
the thing about demon slayer
is that it has reached
the crossover threshold
ya it's no it is no longer limited to
just the weeaboos it is now in the realm of the normies also
ya
then I'm like bro you don't know what the weeaboos go through
I think
mm
ya
ya ya like it takes it takes away from the
from the ya the value the perceived value of the movie
ya I think it's
it's very oxymoronic ah in that
you want
you want these things to succeed
because in order for them to continue making these things
like they need to
there to be a certain scale of popularity
but at the same time when they blow up
then it becomes like
oh no like like I am no longer special
ya
ya
mm
uh haikyu is not that
mm
ya
Hunter X Hunter is quite popular
ya I know
ya
ya like I wanted to buy like
figurines for
oregairu
the
my teen romantic comedy SNAFU
because like the name is actually the title of the anime is actually anti tactical to
the theme of the
grounded in realism
ya like it was well thought out and well written ah
but ya the series just ended like a few months back
like the entire I think that was the fourth season third or fourth season ah
but ya the series just ended but then I cannot find any figures so sad
ya
mm
how it works is usually
in japan itself
before it is being adapted
into anime
like very rarely are there anime originals
and when there are they're either brilliant
ya
so that's basically how it works uh
mm
ah
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
mmhmm
ya
mm
oh
mm
hmm
mm
J drama
mm
ah I watch one but I can't remember the name
real dramas eh
mmhmm
makeup
okay lah
decently young lah
oh
mm
mm
oh bullying eh
mm
ya
uh huh
uh huh
okay
mm
international
because there's a connection
mm
mm
mm ya
oh I mean jakarta is the city pe
oh okay
I think maybe most people who want to take korean are nice people
the not nice people take what language
take japanese
now
can you watch korean without subtitle
ah then after that I I I off I off the subtitle then after that you narrate to me
oh okay
mm
oh okay
a'ah
ah
ah
ah
oh yes yes because they adopted it from the
chinese archipelago
mm
oh yes yes yes
to speak it better than you're writing
ya
and I think speaking
mm
it's the case it's the case for almost everyone
the stages of err child language development
ya I learnt that
ah
koreaboo
but oh ya the key caps
wah
ya then it was like seventeen like that
oh okay
it dropped down some more
ya one O four key
huh
uh most of them use the same stems anyway lah

hi I'm okay
mmhmm
orh
all the way
oh wow
mm mm
mmhmm ya
oh wow
mm
like nobody cares anymore so I don't know whether you experience the same thing or not
hmm
err
and then they they said err depends ah ma'am depends I said huh
circuit breaker ya orh
mm mm
mm on that day itself ah orh okay okay
mm mm
ya and some more the driver is just earning a living thing seh it's like they are just I I mean they are just doing their job lah basically I mean I don't think
because from what I heard from my friends also like the driver they don't check what is inside the content you know like they just take it's like for example like okay like uh mcdonald's then okay ya err like customer number one two three four and then they just say ah ya I am customer one two three four they just take and go they don't check you know what I mean
mm
mm mm
mm
but this is part and parcel of food delivery business huh
their reasoning was because
they are already a food stall they are not earning much and they're also paying grab so in the end the their their earnings is very little so we hope that the customer can understand
so I'm like huh
mm mm
oh my god really
is it because of circuit breaker
mm mm true lah
uh uh
mm mm
mm mm
huh
mm mm
thanks eh
ah maybe lah mm mm mm mm
so ang moh lah you know and then
ya but it's quite serious lah because I don't know
ah
mm eh
mm mm mm
orh
oh
mm mm okay okay
mm orh
mm mm
oh
oh my god crazy and it's scary because you really don't know how you can get it
mm aedes correct ya
mm
most likely it is lah
mm mm mm mm
unhealthy food I mean maybe can eat lah once in a while but then exercise and drink lots and lots and lots of water so like my that I was talking about that case so you know what was his how he cure from dengue
mm correct correct
every other day sure got some story one
in the news both mm mm local and global news hearing the news everyday can be very exhausting sia I don't know I don't know about you but
I feel tired sometimes I feel like tired and scared and like oh my god like when is it ending like everyone keep saying that maybe twenty twenty is the year that the world is going to end because like so many things like you read about what happened in like lebanon that day and then like you know in the the situation is getting out of hand it's
I don't know and then some more they got elections and then like some a lot of other countries are also having elections
crazy mm mm mm mm mm
huh oh my god
so scary
oh my god
mm mm fifty five
I think their hospitals exhausted their beds already
ya
ya lah that's true lah mm mm it's a bit more controlled lah ah
mm mm true true
ya I think they managed to clear out the dormitories already which is good so hopefully the workers can get back to work
you know mm mm
so somehow or rather this I don't know mosquitoes breed there
natural garden ah
ya definitely definitely
mm mm
ya that's true
mm mm
ya lah I mean I the the the thing about this pandemic I feel like people start to realise what they took for granted all this while you know what I mean I mean regardless of whether it was your health or whether it was your family time whether it is your work you know like I mean everyone is like err quite a number of people are still working from home
like you realise that oh my god like working from home is not easy that's
one but two you get to spend more time with your family and three you realize that you know like leading a busy lifestyle is not exactly a good thing like you start to slow down and all that so you know that you know like slowing down is a good thing you know like people you know lah I'm sure you know of people who are like you know they're always busy you know they're like they're traveling
somewhere they are going here they're going there they're going to you know taking photos for their instagram blah blah blah and then you realize after all that like when this pandemic happen then people have to self quarantine like you say
they have to self isolate you know
then like you know don't go out blah blah blah like you realise that
actually all these things are not needed you can just lead a simple lifestyle and you can still be happy and life still goes on you know what I mean like it's not the end of the world if you don't go like you don't go for that weekend getaway or you don't you know post that instagram photo blah blah blah and all that like
is all that is not important seh
mm mm
I can't imagine how the businesses can survive man really like every other day don't you realise like a restaurant is going to close a business is closing down blah blah blah like walao like
I cannot imagine like I I mean I cannot imagine being a business owner right now because like so many things to think about like the rental is one and then there's your set your staff salary your products you know how like so many things
hopefully but like I don't know like so many budgets and reserves already use and
singaporeans being singaporeans they are like complaining about um you know using this reserves for
for all the I mean all these schemes lah like you said so
mm mm ya lor that's why funny ah
mm mm almost half a year lah
mm mm
ya that's on transport food ya
mm mm ya lah ya lah correct
mm mm mm mm
you know if you are working from home they encourage you to do home workout they encourage you to take time off you know blah blah go for a walk blah blah blah like don't
don't stay home too too much because I think
you really can go crazy like you can lose your mind honestly ya mental health is like a very important thing nowadays
mm mm
something that I don't know like
ya lah
correct correct correct or just do virtual lor everything nowadays virtual virtual event
but everything lah everything is now virtual lah like but it's quite actually interesting lah like virtual seminar webinar so quite I mean
ya that's true mm mm
endless seh like non stop like I've been watching so many movies on netflix and it's like endless like non stop like
recently it was funny because they uploaded all the local singapore movies and also
shows so like imagine like recently they had like growing up you know money no enough
like you say lah they want singapore singaporeans in general to stay home more often so why not introduce the classics right I mean who doesn't love like watching the good old days of singapore
mm mm
mm mm
wah
funny ya
ya lah sometimes no choice is the best choice lah ha
mm mm
mm mm physical is no longer really needed lah ha
mm mm mm mm
ya lah but really technology is so amazing like you can really do so much you know what I mean like take photos video call like zoom look at zoom like zoom was a company that nobody knew about like
pre pre COVID pre pandemic now everybody uses zoom
you know what I mean like it's crazy like it it became like overnight like I think their business went through the roof
ya and everybody is video calling I mean as much as they can because
normal I guess you know
mm mm ya
ah wow amazing mm mm
because I think everyone think like because everyone keep saying twenty twenty is pretty much cancelled right like events whatever so I guess they weren't expecting much for also so the fact that they managed to actually pull it off is quite impressive
ya lah mm mm
mm mm ya lah ya lah
mm mm cancelled kan oh postpone ah okay okay
for the event
so I don't know hopefully I mean I don't know lah I guess I mean pretty much twenty twenty is cancelled like we said like events
is you know cancel postpone
oh ya I think I saw that
mm mm
nature is healing ah mother nature is smiling finally after so long
ya I'm sure like air is much cleaner also because like there's no air there's no cars on the road there's no planes in the sky you know there's not much pollution and most of the factories are closed
blessing in disguise ya
mm mm mm mm
ya they don't need to that you you really don't need all that like it all these are like frivolous things you know like we really don't need much to survive actually
mm mm mm
mm mm less is more
mm mm
correct and the good thing no and like I mean the good thing is that people are saving more also right I mean like among all the money amount of money that you're not using you're you're saving what you know
mm mm
ya at least at least I mean all that amount of money that you don't use save it lah you know for something else for something bigger you know
ya
they sell lah oh okay mm mm hobby eh
mm mm ya that's true
ya lah must be positive lah because I mean it is hard to be positive during this pandemic I'm
somehow you have to work towards not feeling that way at all you know what I mean ya easier said than done lah of course but can be done it can be done ya
there's no solution to it you know what I mean
true
standard ah
mm mm
I mean it's complaining is part of life lah you know what I mean but like if you complain everyday and then but you still do the same thing then what good can it really do
mm mm true very true
I feel like there's more hate rather than you you read more negative things than positive things right about people about the news about everything so you kind of have to look for the good in the bad in that sense you know what I mean like
it's like I mean this pandemic ya like there's a lot of people being affected and all that but then I mean the good I mean I guess you have to look for the positive side of it you know you are still alive you know
you still have a job and
ya exactly
completely kan uh uh
ya
mm mm
it's like a must it's like you know it's
you will be fined three hundred dollars is it
if you don't wear
ya so I guess it's like you know you kind of scare people by that but like some other countries I see eh
I don't know maybe countries
countries are like depends on you you know it's like a self thing like mm
mm mm

it was okay lah um they ask me a lot of question I think it's like very normal questions were only there they ask me like so what what caught me off guard was that err they ask me so what's your five year plan
you know like you know you don't think about it so much until you are being asked the question and then for a moment I just sat there jer siala what is my five year plan
err there's a position that opens up in a different department and um my manager thinks that I would be better in that then that is also something that I can also kind of move towards to ah
cause inspiration and aspiration is like what then I was like this needs time because I will not on that day I was a bit like sleepy for the interview so I just like okay mm answering the question never then they ask me something like what's your aspiration I think I said something but it wasn't that clear he ask me again and I said the same thing then he say okay nevermind
okay nevermind
I think it's how you phrase it if like my aspiration is to be able to be a role model when trainees ah sharing my knowledge and empower them that they too can be just as good or even better so it should be your it could be like oh
but it gives me a very nice err
oh long time like super long time well I'm not sure how long but definitely very long oh they are very stable like but I think I think it's a nicer I I feel that is a the whole interview kind of put you at ease you know so it doesn't make you feel tense outright so the way you answer also is not so formal
so it gives you the idea of okay you know I can err I can say a bunch of things but at the same time also it's like oh I'm not gonna penalize you for how you say it about like eh so what you want do you for five years ah ah you know like you like you could say like huh five years ah wah I never really think about it eh and and that's that's fine because you are being honest right but you know but but it's also err
you also answer like oh never really think about it eh but I also feel like five years I want to achieve personal milestones that I have set for myself in example like I want to take up a diploma in five years I wanna see myself radiating from it
I know five years for a diploma is long lah but you know you are working you could only part time you know you could fail a module also whatever but at least you can besides this coming to the questions I answer lah so I actually googled I usually before my interviews I would google some stuff yes just to prepare yourself and also it gives you an idea it's good to be prepared anyway
so give you an idea of like okay what you could use as an answer so and it was just because it's COVID right during the COVID pandemic period so I say ah oh ah I actually I never really think that far because in this COVID situation it's difficult to foresee um so far ahead because everything is still very cloudy
but I also feel I want to be able to achieve um more things
which is true I I think it's also like um I I feel like you you can be choosy but it has to be to a certain degree like I'm not saying that oh err in in example that I used to earn five K I only want to look for jobs for five K what if there are no jobs for five K oh you know what if there is some other jobs that
if you eh I give you three point five lah you want or not you don't want because why you because you wanna you wanna pay me five K exactly but also during pandemic what so people are if there's there's all these companies doing cost saving also what right so I think you choose your job
then how are you I mean yes I know it's during a pandemic but how are you going to like you know gain experience in this tough time how do you want to gain experience in a different um setting it's all about how you make it um you make it work in the in in this stuff kan lah fourteen december
it has been like what five years and if it's another five years it will be like ten years
I mean my my my business partner always ask me like so when are you going to come back to do the brand full time
of course I said for now it's a bit difficult like because I have other commitments to to juggle with maybe and then yesterday when I met her she ask me so how do I like the job yes I do like the job like
I mean like I have a new colleague so it's it's better now and I'm getting used to the job demand just that um
I don't want to be too greedy lah like to always do like different side projects is quite tiring yes so I just focus on my plan and this job
and I'm applying for house the so I don't know if I if I would get the sales of balance flats or if not cheaper ones if not have a resale like buy buy a resale wah that's that's okay too
yes but if you buy a resale then if it's like an older block the renovation costs I mean if the previous owners kept the house clean and decent and there's nothing much to pack ah but if it's sales of balance flats as in like no one has lived there before not that bad I feel cause it's a brand new house but it depends on location
yes I know your work right um about your own brand so she will your business partner ask you in a way whether you wanna do full time then it's there
err
you know it's funny when you you talk about that so like my current
it's the same people who say that kind of things to me at work and yet
billing up to like five six hundred dollars
yes you don't say lah hello you know your five hundred dollar is equal to like five thousand dollars to some people you don't hello exactly a part of me is like wah you say this kind of things ah
but you can spend five hundred dollar in my store and five hundred dollars sometimes it's just like two item three items
and and err we are on we are on the third floor right and then we can also see the crowd in the first and second floor so the first floor is two iconic brands like in every single household there would at least be one item I mean not every single household lah but you know on an average
mm
they are big paper bags that means they are handbags and you know the value of handbags is in not small amount okay we put minimum say three thousand wow
wow
I could spend three thousand in one day but I don't have three thousand to spend
okay
how much was it so did you not cancel the subscription
why wouldn't you want to cancel if you don't have sixty dollars to spend
in things that requires subscription there's always a minimum of seven days for you to unsubscrbe before it gets charged
dude that is why they have the terms and condition that you need to read yes and you woke up the next day did you hello
has it passed seven days I mean if you can read up lah I'm sure they give you the invoice right then it will come with the terms and conditions right but for subscription you can actually cancel lah but if you have paid for the one year and technically you have just use like what a few weeks so most to most they gonna charge you for one month
then there is that possibility of they refunding the last eleven months I don't know or what you can do so you remember when I was looking for their french company we were also doing subscription right so you know what they do they they look at their bank account eh there's a there's a transaction of this amount they call up their bank and they say it's fraud and then the bank will automatically um
do a a charge dispute to that company so that means our company so we have to refund them
yes yes yes yes so people say why am I getting charged for this I didn't err I didn't I didn't I didn't sign up for this so what they would do is they will call the bank hello there's a fraudulent transaction on my card then the the bank will say oh it was charged to this company do you remember signing up for any sort of no I only went to their website err can it can I request a charge back I want a refund
and then they will do it they will say okay madam you will receive your refund in the next fourteen to to how many days and the money goes back to your account eh you should do it really you you laugh it's actually how it is how do you think I do the charge back all the time I'm not telling you to be a cheapo but it it's not a necessity and in this trying times you should save money bro
see that's why you shouldn't play with your phone when you are half asleep sure like that would work later you will only sleeping closer to the charger
well I'm thinking of getting um this collagen I don't have swiss I thought I have doctor say I don't so I don't
err it's the security
yes yes yes I went for everything for the scan for the test the cancer cancerous test the basic test and all the test that is required so
so I can take collagen
ah yes
so what I'm doing now cause it's black friday right black friday gonna be friday saturday sunday monday cause cyber monday but so I look at the website and then err kinohitmisu and then
the website is selling like sixty bottles for ninety eight bucks
the first when you start the first six days is one bottle a day then subsequently it's once every two to three days yes so it's kinda like a two month worth lah or three right
and then um
yes I do but my new job requires me to wear safety shoes yes
even so everybody yes so you know when I enter the office right everybody was in uniform and in safety shoes
so that's why you have to wear safety shoes for safety reasons
monday to friday yes
yes duty area is different ah
but my for me it's office hours ah oh my god yes four years I mean okay lah I think is okay yes and then also like like
you know sometimes when you afternoon shift then you come in the afternoon then the bus and the train is not so not so
definitely
that is true
then weekend where you want to go go out lah with your kid go to town don't want to shop also you shop see see look look
err doctor say to take it once every three months
but it's it's not wise to take pills on a regular because then eh it's only functioning because it was induced not because it's happening naturally therapy yes actually
what supplement are you taking mm
so after ten days cannot
satay mushrooms oh my god
so it's like indian milk tea ah
can you imagine if you went vegetarian mm
yes but because we grew up with that right yes
but they can also make you broken

so they told me one of my teammate told me to
told me that they will be bringing me out for a birthday dinner
the driver and two of my other teammates came out
and then when they came and approach me they said that
of guys around my table they also turn and look like why am I sitting alone in a table in a big round table for about ten people but I was the only one sitting there then my friends will like
so uh of course I was even more happy lah that you got like the birthday present I wanted but having said that

I prefer those kind of like intimate stuff where I can spend times with my friends and family that I'm really really

think about anything but then again
we barely see any sheeps you barely see any

okay so we have come to the end of this one hour conversation
thank you very much bye

okay I'm in
ya
ya
ya ya
how many people
wow
mmhmm
ya ya
ya
mmhmm
I think
they are
ya
ya
ya it's not basically is minuscule
I don't know
that's good man
that's good
ya I think so
so what next week starts ah
no
mm
ya ya ya ya
uh your skills your skill set and your experience kan
ya
the phase three ya
should be end jan
ah
you mean this this christmas coming now
okay
ya uh
okay
ya
ya
ya ya ya
mm
mm
would you be able to do that
ya
different things to do ah
ya
too tired
eh
feed her feed her
mm
mm
that's good ya they would have they would have a lot of drives volunteer drives because I'm I'm sure I'm sure some volunteers don't stay here I mean you know
kan
ya ya ya the also has lots of volunteer drives because ya one of it is the volunteers they don't stay for too long
so they always of course they always need to have volunteer drives
I mean anyway they have different volunteers
so you can some of them are dog walkers which is very popular because you get to chill with the dogs
err and then
critical care means for newborns newborns newborn kittens newborn kittens so they call me but you can always say okay I I volunteer
ya no lah fosterer no
what
ya uh yes
but I can if I volunteer okay for example if I volunteer for the kittens right so I pay for the food and all that medical I can go to their clinic
has a clinic ya they have a one of the very few I think if I'm not mistaken they might be the only animal shelter with a clinic ah they their clinic is relatively new some more
so I it's should because I'm fostering for them so let's just say oh the kitten is sick so I call the clinic and say eh your kitten I fostering for you you know it has flu then they say okay come by so I make an appointment and I go to the clinic and then they treat and then they I don't pay lor
because it's their fosterer it's their foster kitten I'm just taking care so I don't pay for the uh but I must go to their clinic okay so if I decide to go to my own clinic outside which I have done before then I cannot waive cannot claim or anything like that
is run by
donations they are run they run on donations
ya yes
people who recognise them and and and and donate sizable you know maybe companies or so I guess I don't know how well funded they are but they probably aren't so bad you know
government
ah G O V
but that is the problem
no that's rubbish lah cannot be
these dogs are still inhabitants of this country otherwise where are they going to go they have to be taken care of
in a humane way lah you know ah in fact I was just talking about it to uh to my grab driver over here
you know like all these developments that we are doing kan
development you know all the new new condos new property development sorry the is building up and they are raising and they are just flattening all the lands and the jungles
so and some other animal welfare groups are the ones having to pick up the pieces of these the dogs getting chased out the dogs have no place to go they cannot go back into the jungles they cannot go into a residence into into you know heartlands and all that so but who is pushing them out we know who is pushing them out who but who is picking up the pieces animal welfare groups who are running on completely on donations which is like come on you know what I mean kan it's like ya I feel that it's it's it's it's it's just rubbish lah what is happen there is no collaboration I feel there is no collaboration
first kills the dogs
no they don't both okay
I mean this this this look at
right now there are but the numbers declining is is really this that means eventually the dogs are going to go they're going to be completely out and what we want is you know can you guys collaborate a bit more no not bit more there's no collaboration can you guys collaborate with given if you're going to build and develop these places do something right but they're not
babe wild dogs wild boars and pythons where are they going why why why the pythons are coming out they are all in the drains what why are they coming out you tell me why are they coming out now why are there wild boars coming out now like in pasir ris why because pasir ris you know all the animal welfare groups the shelters were all there before right they were all there before no pasir ris farm way they were all there before the government took the land and they moved them to tengah now they are all in tengah now the animal welfare groups so they are developing pasir ris that's why the wild boars are there now you see them walking around wild boars why because there is a very clear example of this is what happens when you push them out they are going to end up out being visible uh to all residents who are going to panic
ah
pythons also
ACRES
and also and also the wild boars ACRES ACRES why do have why do you have picture of the snails on your
oh wow
ah
oh they are all the same
so what happens is what happen is you call ACRES ACRES will take ACRES ACRES A C R E S they are the animal the wildlife the wildlife group in singapore like monkeys ACRES the wildlife they are in charge so they can come up and take the snake I mean as in they trap the snake and what they would do they would microchip and they would release back into the jungle ya so that the snake is um is tagged ya they do that they're tagged then they will release back into the jungle so it still goes back into the jungle exactly where are they going to go right so they go back into the jungle then eventually they have to come out of the jungle again uh so so it solves nothing it solves nothing you know
ya they they microchip them they have to tag it so that they know that this is the one we have done before we've helped before something like that cute kan
quite a few
I don't like lizard
ya aww
is it oh so sweet
ya
aww bless her aww ya
that means you leave the food there and you walk away that one have but feeding I don't think so it's not illegal
right
ya
ya that one we tell people not to do
national environmental agency they are the ones in charge of dengue dengue mosquito breeding all of that and the environment lah
so water ya it's it's very tough water food you are supposed to feed the cat stay there I mean and then clear you're supposed to clear your feeding you have two hours to clear
you can get ya if someone catches you you can get fined
everybody if somebody reports you can end the ya you can you can get
for example if you feed right and then just in case happens to walk past then you kena fine lah or somebody reports you or what ya you can ya
no littering
you have to clear the food within two hours
you have to you have to okay you can feed
uh okay for example I feed I feed the cat the cat is here I'll feed the cat I put the food down all right I cannot go home
okay I cannot go home kan
you don't have to necessarily sit there and watch
but you have to you go you can go and feed more cats then you come back and within two hours you clear this is what we mean by within two hours
so at the end of the day within the two hours you come back and you clear lah some people of course they choose to just sit there okay and then go
that's what we mean by two hours
must clear the cat food yes
yes
all the cockroaches rats and all that ya so they don't want that so it's not illegal to feed but is you cannot litter
which is to me is fair enough lah you know like we let you feed then you know because then the cats are hungry then they will go to hawker centres and bother people
you know and then of course it's also a nice thing to be humane right the cats are going to be there they are going to be hungry anyways you might as well feed them
at the end it's littering lah I don't know on the spot is a forty fifty I don't know
whatever that is whatever the market rate is
ya but that one is littering lah
ya so feeding is not illegal littering is so what we call it we call it uh we we tell people to be responsible feeders
they they responsible feeding is what they want
and you can see signs posters you know at the lift no lah maybe not here lah but maybe other places you can see signs about responsible feeding
which is good lah to remind people you know kind of like that kan
ah
oh my goodness
they are copy cats
ya lah that's called district cats lah they're called community cats we call them
a pet cat
a pet cat some pet cats probably don't get
ya
ya it's their it's their joint
it's their joy
I know
mm
ya
ah
ah ya
eh
mm
because so much traffic eh
mm
ya
mm
mm
mm ya
but it's quite safe what this this tree
traffic
uh ya
ah
okay
ya
ah
ya
back to their refuge lah
people who work there know where these fellas go uh their time table their schedule like ya at ten o'clock they will be here but later they will go that way that way oh then by twelve o'clock they will be at that pond
uh so funny and it's true right they would go almost every uh almost everyday
I guess is connected to the I I don't I don't know where I mean I don't botanic gardens then connected to where ah the drains ah does it go to I don't know uh so anyways they were at the botanic gardens almost a lot I see them twice still the same ya but no when I was there there were also people but uh it's just you know the thing about botanic gardens is that although it is busy it's a refuge because
uh so I guess I guess in the botanic gardens the otters would feel safe despite
the number of people and visitors ya because it's a you know there are very strict laws right in the botanic gardens you cannot pluck the flowers you cannot pluck anything you cannot touch the animals so because of the set of rules uh I guess you know the the otter felt safe lah
oh
you know there are a few families ah apparently
otter
there is a fan club ah
okay when I say fan club means the people who are watching they love the otters they are the
they they monitor the otter activity
so they have the okay only the otter fan club lah
so and they they are actually very knowledgeable they know oh this is the kallang clan
so they have identified at least two families
two families which is
this is their territory oh then there's another clan which is
somewhere else not kallang so that is the one so they have different families lah all clans
maybe another clan huh
ah ah so they are very well fed they are you know they are very clever lots of fish
I don't think they look for other clans
um when they I I I don't think I think is like when I say kallang clan is like is like this is their territory
their roaming range is this is their range you know cats are like that
so for example if your cat is in this block he's he can range from this block to a few blocks ah this is their range so I'm sure they have the same
I guess among themselves lah I guess but they're very they're very they're very family oriented
so they can see the babies and all that and if fact a few died actually because one got caught
the angler hook aiyo so sad ah I think that was one was near uh
uh one of the um
so they have a few I'm not kidding about the clan I may have okay I call it clans I don't think it's called clan but you know what I mean
the the family ya
ya they do there there are a few at least two or three what I I remember in the news lah okay so what I remember in the news
um
I don't know if they live there
they don't they don't they roam
they roam they'll rove they rove um they
they might not they might not be the same clan because it's a bit far um the botanic gardens might be the same one as the maybe ya I don't know you know I don't know they don't just when they when they they don't just live in the botanic gardens it's one of their hangouts lah
one of their hangouts you know ah
ya ya ya
wah the otters right
cute right
ya uh
eh cute
ya but don't forget people are now becoming more aware of wildlife and all that no now
ya
you know ya
I think it's so refreshing I don't think so no uh unless they are caught by ACRES but so far no they are not caught by ACRES they don't need to be caught by acres because I told you the fan the fan club they are very active and they know they go like uh in fact when you sometimes the news right they can they can say oh this the the the kallang clan they have had two new babies they actually can know and recognise like there are seven adults and two new babies the mother is pregnant we go like wow bloody hell how do they know I guess they know lah they're like super fans which is really nice
nice to know right that you know there's this group of people who are just so so in tuned and they are like the the they are the they they walk they care for them it's really nice
you know not the caretaking type lah but ya they they the the otter watch group the otter watch group ya
no no no
I think the ulars maybe are not as I don't know maybe not as vulnerable and
and well okay lah let's put it this way lah shallow as it as it may sound but not as cutesy you know
as otters otters is becoming like a tourist tourist the attraction tau
but snakes and you know otters and snakes you know the the the whole perception of snakes being dangerous and all that
so no lah they don't snakes no but snakes if they are caught if you sight a snake at the drain you call ACRES and then ACRES will come and trap and tag them and release them back into the forest
they don't kill or anything like that that's why we call ACRES ACRES is good they are the wildlife
ah then forget it then forget it the cases that ACRES have have caught were the snakes are still there
so we have had we have had cases where ACRES came in and then the snake and then the bulge it's a com cat it's a community cat
nothing just tag and take them nothing just don't kill the snake it's a it's just tag it and then just release lah
go back to the forest I told you they release it back into the forest but this is where we when we back to our initial conversation where
back they go back into the forest but eventually they will come out again

I guess that's a need lah not a wish
but the thing is when I watch your when I watched that video that you uploaded kan it's like a it's a live stream but the thing is sometimes all I want to know is if I'm not playing that game I wouldn't know like what you are trying to do kan
because right how I can relate is like you know those there's this kind of channel or video and err where you watch people eat
because I think I watch the live stream not the edited one
just you just now you say about the spiders suit right I was thinking
I don't know just now err
for your suit jer
include ship
how long you need to wait for
I don't know whether you want to get for the kids cause they will grow very fast
he can wear the puffy one ah
how about the brother
what about the mum mother what we have a tripod for what
K lah faster lah you order for me and then you order for safi also lah
I want to wear the gwen okay that's the only character that I can wear right
spiderman series lah kan
then I just pass it off as spider cat ah
the one that you say oh black cat right spider cat is the we just created a new character
just created a new character no I think he followed me ya he followed the style of conversation no but you ate cheese fries already yesterday oh ya I'm supposed to cook the soup first
ya for dinner then at least tomorrow you can eat it for lunch lah
the thing is I don't know whether I ah actually I want to take half day I got
no I wait the following week is not christmas right
ah I will take next week actually
because I got one more half day I never take wait let me think
oh gosh I don't know because next tuesday I already on leave kan maybe I just take this friday lor next tuesday is for its for appointment what
wah I don't get it seh how did you even accumulate fourteen days eh oh ya because she she doesn't need to take leave like me right
wow what a plan
I wish I could say that
ya that's the thing because you your contract already said you need to clear you need to give it two months notice that's why you you have that mind mindset that you need to save them
oh
during his first year birthday eh wait but that is last year but then how come this year my leave exhausted I think it's because the the sick or when they are sick I keep taking leave at the start of the year
then can we buy like two so one is on the left one is on the right
so the alternative is either we change the sink or we build a
serious I thought he called somebody
father in law
were we even there I was not there
what a shitty experience
was the EX1>bangla< paid
aiyo I'm just thinking
okay lah no no I'm not even thinking of renovating the toilet
then the is the end product nice
no I mean like dan house
you can just ask what
like that
huh
no I mean especially if it's if no surprise to see talking about surprise that's the thing sometimes right it works err in your favour sometimes
not hot pink lah like the like the lighter one like a bit more pale
the app no lah that one champagne gold lah ya ya ya correct correct correct ah like that
ya that's the only cause the master bedroom you know I don't think I want to change anything maybe maybe just the part ah change to a bigger no the thing is right no no no let me just explain I want to use
projector you know that one no you know they have this technology where you bring like the kind of like tissue box style and then you can project the thing when you have it's not a torchlight it's a projector
like the the torchlight for the story book eh
gosh
h
no but that's the highest I could go I couldn't and then what I need kan
no the the photo they want it to be the resolution when you port it to photoshop kan is in three hundred but my the the camera that the G seven X camera at my office the highest you can go is hundred and fifty or hundred and eighty the point and shoot
camera our phone cannot set raw kan raw image file
what iphone can ah
four A is small kan
aiyo
I'm just thinking what should we have what shall we eat for dinner already cause I know but that's for the kids
oh
so in the end you pick up what time
oh
sensitive eh
it's okay ah
that's very good that's a five star rating for the delivery man
eh sia lah
why ah
oh right right right um I remember um they asked me to rate that time ya rate your delivery person
oh right right right ah I remember err they ask me to rate that time your rate your delivery person
oh
I don't know some people they they always say err you always have room for improvement so they always give four point five I'm like what the heck tell me ah where is the room then they always like oh you know we cannot give perfect score because you know we must leave some room for us maybe that's why I know I know
huh
beat it ah
beat it ah
I can't remember maybe maybe I think my reaction was the same as last time ah
it's harder to
is because of the figure of eight
crank course not crank course lah plank
the crank course is ninety degrees kan its like U-turn lah
no I thought that one only for the first lesson only
only the first lesson kan I don't know lah I'm just thinking whether I should take class two a
drink this water or not
from last week lah that I am that's okay what it's just water
huh what do you mean
doesn't correspond with the job ah
huh
ya how much how much did he did he quote
um
right
ya lah
okay but that that is not her problem what is the deal ya is the deal between the father and ya you guys what like he has no right to intercept what who told him
there is another company if you all want to consider ah it's quite easy video ya work not bad lah but maybe the okay but you also not going to stay there but if you want to do them a favour you can check it no but will will will you will you even like speak to them about the like if they need any video
eh is it because of the the payment the changes oh that sucks

a'ah
that's the thing okay about romanticism kan okay there's
is quite
toxic ah is when you
that's why there's this research ah woman fall in love when they hit orgasm
most most likely they fall in love when they hit orgasm
they want to make it happen cause they don't want to make it seem that they are hoe
a'ah
a'ah
when you place yourself like okay you're my true love
I can only have sex with you
more than me
what she gives me
he may not give me but what you give me
is something that she cannot
give me and what you give me is something that I want ah
overthinking ah ah but at the end of the day there there's a lot of factors that contribute to this ah
one she's alone overseas
romanticism
and you are offended
I don't know what else to talk about
happiness is happiness by itself ah
cause you don't compare yours with another people ya

oh no
no so it's all for nots
but
shazam
okay now it's
better
okay
okay now it's better
I think it's too loud
okay let's try now
I thought it is okay
something is wrong
ishak that one is fashion
err
actually this fauzi salleh was just doing the
fauzi salleh
he's
on blue
who is like forty plus senior
ya ya ya
err
and wedding
okay ah eh
maybe my order is confirmed
now it's much better the sound is much controlled
but now it's turning red
okay I ask thomas
don't start the chat
thomas
tom
did you manage to get into the room
no that's yours
but the no but now it's okay already
the lines are within reach
it's too much white noise
it was right
specifically in hawaii no lah hawaii taxes are four percent
oh
oh I should google that
oh ya true
oh that now recording
okay we have to do this voice recording
why
it's quite easy to code switch I think I've never realise it so it's not that difficult
check bank

if that day right I already start uh applying for jobs on this uh
fast job app online then a few of the jobs ah like very interesting
have you ever tried that before
but uh because the pay they say it's about hundred and twenty per visit
they will see your they will see your feedback and then after that they will uh record and then they will see then they will pay
mm
mm but that time when you got the pay how much is it
so they pay according to the outlet you go or they just pay according to the assignment
mm
ah
so basically you just have to rate the uh display and then the customer service price you know but price should be the same right
oh my god
but it's so weird right I mean like you are being a demanding difficult customer and then end up you never buy paiseh right
so it's kind of like they are expecting you to come lah it's just that they don't know who only right
oh my god
but imagine ah if let's say they
there's like two or three shopper inside and then they are showing good service to other people except you
then ah another job I tried right is the
then they call me actually they said the um it's a permanent part time but it's at unity
be to commit long term because I was telling them
and she resigned straightaway you know ya she just informed my boss she just say that uh she got a new job
and then she just decided to leave the company lah but anyway the market is also not so good right now right
so ya lah anyway I don't know how much is the pay though but it's quite good lah it's three times a week only
mm permanent part time but they need it uh long term
uh shift work I think they will give it to you eight hours per day
is so it's quite convenient what it's just like one train away
don't have to even change train
mm
ya
that's why I was thinking I was attracted to the job because I was thinking
I have to work twice a week with the current employer
so these three three another three days right I can actually
they ask me to commit until one year who knows what's going to happen next year right
because if the economy pick up then I will have to work full time already mah
uh the hypermart the shopping mall at your place
three three to eleven or something like that the one that I think you say too early to come right
but anyway they only need two staff lah
mm mm
so just anyway just send lah just see how
but some of them ah don't even bother to reply
one six months ah six months to one year you know
and then uh they say you cannot choose the shift
you cannot choose uh the day that you want to work everything will be assigned by the manager
and it's just temperature taking
and the what do they do they just sit there right and then they make sure that you do the safe entry and then they make sure that your temperature is okay and then you wear mask
ten dollar eh
the one
there are so many infection
then you don't know if you are going to get infected
because the one that I saw published is a wet market
ten dollar per hour
then after that err also I think it's mondays to
eh it's alternate days eh
like monday you work tuesday you off and then wednesday you work
but the problem is my current job we won't know our work schedule until nearer the date
so I cannot commit to the days that the temperature screening wants to take also
yes
put in the days that they want us to work like sometimes I can work monday friday sometimes it's like wednesday thursday sometimes in a week I only work one time
sometimes they ask me to take annual leave right so the whole week I will not be working like this week ah
actually they will give us uh every end of the month for the following month
and the worst part is of course you have to prioritize your current job
ah rather than your part time job
the shift and you cannot choose the time so she doesn't want to commit
and then down here got problem so in the end she decided to quit lah and then she choose she told the unity side to that you want to work full time instead
the qualification lah I think
they actually put her to a supervisor slash manager role you know
work go back to their country and still work because we work remotely right
then my company say cannot because uh according to the rule you cannot do that lah if you work in singapore
you are under singapore employment you cannot go back philippines or malaysia or brunei then work from their remotely because
so basically ah you are giving all your pay to your landlord you know
even my ex colleague also I I heard uh my ex company
some of the pinoys ah they instead of staying one room one person right now what they did is
two person or three person in one room so they share the rental so at least if the rental is like six hundred each of them pay two hundred
rent
he actually rented out his room you know to malaysian
so what he did is because he's staying alone now
so these uh factory workers right actually contacted him directly and rent his room the two rooms
so you know what monthly he got extra uh I think thousand five or two thousand you know
for the two rooms eh and then I think there's uh three three or four people only renting like per room I think got two people lah
and most of the time he say he just stay in his room
day time he's at home he's working remotely lah
and
so he said uh sometimes they dabao then sometimes they cook so he just eat
then when come to cleaning the house and everything right
everybody just do their part lah
then I say the toilet how then he say the toilet toilet they clean lah then I'm like eh but you are using the toilet also eh
how can you ask people to clean and some more they pay you rent eh
good money right actually
that's why at least something right
too bad I don't have room to spare
ya
we every time have to go to the kitchen go to the toilet you know
for him is everything he have is in the room he can just lock himself in the room
so I guess it's better for him also lah
ya actually he was saying maybe after COVID over right he was thinking of selling off the house also
so we were telling him why do you want to sell the house you see it can generate income for you you know even if you want to retire early right you can just
rent out the extra rooms that you have and then ya get income from there
you don't have to work so hard anymore
I think still have a bit ah that time he mentioned
it's just that when it comes to spending you have to be more prudent lah you cannot um anyhow spend
that's why
ya
maybe have lah because um they had they didn't really close all the borders worldwide
it's just that right now travel is only restricted to business or people going back to their hometown own country
ya
and um I think flights also not regular so you have to
they have to go means they have to go lah I guess but then
ya lah like you say I that day I went to linkedin also I saw they can still offer salary at like six thousand for or you know
I mean like it's too good to be true right
actually I also think so you know I mean like maybe most of the uh advertisement right or the job uh post on link in linkedin
because I think now they know that a lot of people are being retrenched out of job
so people are looking for a job so what they do is they just entice you
maybe interview will be just with the recruitment agency lah
and then once they interview you they will rate you and then they will if let's say anybody looking for
any position any position open right then they will see who qualifies best lor
but then six thousand eh
I didn't know that uh all these personal assistant right and executive assistant can earn until so much you know
but but with six K ah I don't think the job is going to be as easy as it looks ah sometimes you know all these bosses
retrench
golden handshake
that is what we call work smart
I'm sure ah when she earn ten K per month that time right she will
she will keep some and like you say she got rental from condo all these rental from condo ah is not cheap you know I mean like if it's a corporate rental ah can
give her like four five K per month eh
because I have friends who married ang moh right so expat ah
so can you imagine the owner of the condo every month ah you can just shake leg if you don't work also can you just take it rental five thousand
ya
good right
anyway then after that you guys don't keep contact already ah
but how long have she been working with the company
but sometimes boys boss bosses lah I mean like um
as male bosses are okay
ya they can demand a lot of things or this one cannot that one cannot you know I don't like this I don't like that
err the husband is paying what why is the wife getting involved you know
but sometimes again you cannot blame the the bosses because the bosses are too busy
so they leave it over to the wife to handle and that's where it gets complicated
entitlement so instead of going back home they can use it for their holiday trip
so what the they did is they always ah book first book a travel first
then got one time ah suddenly the the secretary call me and say eh how come my boss ah the krisflyer point is um
so I check check check then I say no so far is all paid by this uh relocation company
the wife redeem uh free ticket
to go to london and then after that go to new york to visit the daughter
she never she never tell him that's why then he like what
and the best part ah they didn't even uh say anything to me you know
then after that uh until I ask again ah
the how you find out about the missing miles
is it really our fault or krisflyer for or whose fault
and then the secretary also paiseh ah I said oh ya we found out actually the wife claim the miles because want to get free ticket
she thought that the uh points are expiring so she thought maybe ya she just claim lor
and never even bother to tell him
ya
ya and then yet the company is telling us to save cost save cost
what the hell right
so you have to take either the mid range but maybe you can only uh get like fifty percent of the mileage
very flexible one ah that one you will get hundred percent of the mileage
I always get like you see lah you you keep on telling us to get the cheapest one the cheapest one then in the end
we when we change it become more expensive like hello it's not my job you know you company is telling is your company's direction
otherwise right if you want to sell this type of ticket ah you must tell them this one ah if you change right is so much so much already so you better
you better think first before we do the changes before we proceed to book or issue the ticket
then in the end what happen
but how much was the ticket
and then how you explain to your boss
but how much how much was the ticket
okay lah not that much ah
ya because usually the cheapest one then you cannot no refund no nothing everything cannot right
of course it's the chance for airlines to just freely get four hundred dollars and nobody is travelling they can sell back the seat to the public
why not
no but but how come you book you don't book all three together
even if it's their fault also they will just push to somebody cause but then you cannot lah because this is obviously your mistake
for us ah the reason is always like that we already send to you the email why you never check and then now you want to say that we did it wrongly
when actually it's
obviously it's our fault lah because by right whatever that they give us we have to counter check and make sure that everything is alright what how can we just you know
but it's actually very scary ah especially if
luckily he is a nice person can you imagine if he's the demanding one like no I want to fly now
I don't care what flight you get for me blah blah blah blah blah blah
so that means you actually buy him a new ticket
and then the new flight that you take for him
ya
but he's from which airport
it's either ho chin minh or hanoi
so in the end I think you must have booked him on lah because only these two fly direct what
ya
ya lah very scary especially the hotel bit
of course he's also angry right that's why I say luckily he didn't jump and you know scold you on the spot
actually you shouldn't divide like that you should do the flight and then one person do the flight one person do the hotel
you do this batch I do this batch ah it's quite difficult
or maybe what you can do is what you should do is
if you want to divide the job right so you based on the departure date lah so at least eh
which is more urgent and then you take the one departure departing on monday which is less urgent and you got more time to check
wait wait wait so that means ah the person that you cock up is your team or
the hotel sell to them ten room and then booking dot com maybe the hotel sell fifteen rooms
so it depends on how much how many rooms the website want to buy from the hotel lah
you tell them that you have a group of more than ten people then see negotiate the pay rate ah
maybe you should have gotten the hang of it of it already what
you can always book um through
all these third party from the website lah no problem it's just that we can group is a bit is going to be a bit messy so maybe you just have to organise
and when it comes to hotel because sometimes ah hotel themselves even though they give uh they sell their rooms to all these third party
yes they have to they have to keep a few rooms available in case if people walk-in what
then they will sell it at a higher rate of course lah right
so if let's say you have a group of at least more than ten even five people ah
you can also tell them you you have five people coming in on this date
so what is the best price that you can give that's what we always do also
okay if let's say you have like long stay
people staying like a week or ten days at least ah you also can call them and you tell them okay I have this one ah family who wants to stay for ten days
so what is your best rate
ya you can just call them don't go to the third party first because uh booking from third party ah I know it's quite difficult
because you have to do one by one one by one right
ya
actually the best if you call the hotel like they will organize everything we just say okay saturday departure I have five and then maybe monday
monday uh sorry saturday arrival I have five pax
and then monday arrival I have another ten pax
then how
but hong kong passport don't need visa what
I know vietnam visa is very expensive
you can it can cost about four hundred to six hundred dollars
no but usually visa upon arrival lah always uh tourist
so probably this time round when he go he at airport where they ask him what is your purpose of travel he say business
that's why he cannot
they don't allow him to go
I guess when you arrange for travel you just have to
most importantly is the visa
especially those people holding like indian passport indonesia china
mm
otherwise you will waste one day
they he will not be chilling he will be like screaming at you
he he must have hated the person so much or it's just
he's like telling the camera person to just F off
but he's like one of the bosses or no
ya
I think people everybody have their evil side
sometimes ah you just
can you imagine ah if you are working with all these fun people then suddenly one day the company just go bust
everybody have to go your separate way sad right
but then ah I mean like for your case also it's quite difficult
so are you going to take it or you just want to stay with the company you know
I mean like if you move on you have start all over again
but if you stay on you don't know what is your future going to be like
I think this company uh based right
oh
so I guess I think everybody also scared it's better to have a second job
ya
I mean if it comes up then you see the situation your company
if it's not getting any better then you just grab the opportunity ah anyway if you go interview also doesn't mean that you get it duh
ya just put out your resume first ah
mm

alright err what were we talking about singapore social right ya

then err
I think
err I'm fine with everybody it's just that I cannot get along right with I cannot get along with

I really really don't that
I really really don't like
so
ya lor actually in all honesty ah I kind I kind of hate everybody ah

more than I hate myself
is a very interesting character is one in a million diamond in the rough
should tell her that ah
tell her that
you have any other hot friends
yes I'm very I'm I'm very very I'm for life
or am I
I don't know I'm I'm I'm regretting all my time in right now
no
actually that's really messed up that's really messed up you know the fact right that all
all most of the
toilet recording all the most of the toilet recording incidents right
all happened ah
like you know
is most of them right that make the news ah is all
it's all guy on guy crime that's one
then it's all on the N it's all in you know then err
and this is not the and I mean there's been one or two cases right very very recently that they just brought up
that was just that was just brought up
then err but this wasn't new you know because like say about a year
about a year ago right about a year a year two years ago ah
because I sleep in school
so uh and
my friends they also know they also know this ah
most of the it's
and some more it's in you know how embarrassing
no lah but
no lah but it it it you know it just it just happens right that I'm also schooling in you know shit
no
but then again but but then again but then again
err most of the
err most of the incidents takes err take place in ah
whereas the places where I
patron right err
the toilets where I go to ah they are more like
public access whereas the
hostel ones right they uh most of them
err some of these hostels right they some from what I from my knowledge ah
I'm not too sure about this lah I can't confirm but
there are some right where
err
I think this one also depends on the price of your accommodation ah
like some is you only get a room only the toilet is shared
there's only like one toilet on one floor
for you to enter you have to there's everybody has a key
everybody has a key then you have to open the thing there was one time after an exam
I really really really needed to take a
so
err
cannot already
so me and my friends we actually went over
knock on the knock on some random person's door and then tell them
so the guy actually err took I still remember you err he had the
quickly rushed with us you know to the toilet then open then I I entered ah so that was the
first and probably the last time right I entered a
err
you know that like single floor toilet ah
it's just a
it commune toilet ah communal toilet ah that's all only which I can
I can see why right I can see I can probably tell you why lah people
err those pervs right they are more inclined to
to to do this kind of nonsense ah
um there
for you to do that there's only two ways one is you have a
second if you don't have a you need to uh err
you need to involve yourself in hall activities
but
that's lame ah err that's lame lah uh I
a friend of mine who I used to serve with when I was in wallaby
he told me right that that's that used to be the case but it's no longer but currently it's no longer the case already like
uh for them right they're just willing to rent out the accommodation to you ah
that's it only there's no need for you to like
you know and then sweat your punk ass
and then err like or hall activities ah like
yay sixers or whatever
so lame
it's quite it's quite cringey ah it's quite cringey like
there was one there was one time err
err they had like
a orientation week orientation week
it's always the week before the semester starts ah
so they had I swear to you ah it was really cringey
err they had those like err orientation games ah then
they printed out shirts and everything so it was a game of thrones theme
so they uh like what I saw like a bunch of guys in a bunch of guys and girls right they were all
wearing the same thing blue T-shirt then it was like starks and then like
running away from a group of red people in red right who were like gangsters so to me right that's a bit cringey lah
who the hell is running man
who is running man
I have no idea who the hell that is
maybe it's just me lah ah probably it probably is lah just me but
until now I still don't get
err
I don't get the concept of hype beast
I don't understand the concept of hype beast
err last time it used to be
the trend is tight T-shirts is like slim fit tight T-shirts now the trend is
loose or slightly oversized T-shirts so
err
it's weird lah if you ask me
meh
what trumpist
rare commodity okay
oh okay wait hold up hold up you're referring to you're referring to
oh okay lah that's pretty american lah you don't I don't see that the the closest thing I've seen in singapore is um
err I think there was one time I think err can't remember what's her name ah she wore a baseball T-shirt
she wore that was like baseball baseball outfit
to work
no lah but filipino is like that what they that's their that's their sport ah
that that's their sport it's the same as it's the same logic as
I think philippines
philippines they have a they are known to really like
they are known to like basketball
and they are also known for engineering and nursing also that's why
you see ah like when err back in my old workplace ah the one before
the one before
the guy err he also told me also and
the place there right there were quite a handful lah there were quite a lot of err filipino guys ah
so ya
oh okay
damn
filipino ah to begin with
how sure are you
really
okay
okay fine whatever
wei xiang is which one
oh wait it
okay right then
mm
really
wait
what's he is he working there full time what what's his position there what's he doing exactly in
until now
and that's such a waste ah
like I mean err I get I mean if
if your highest hopes in life right is to be a cashier
for a departmental store right then more power to you lah but
it kind of sounds like a shame ah what did he study when he was in when he was pursuing his diploma
ah
can can you I don't know got stocks to trade for FairPrice that kind of thing ah
oh really
really
okay I really I probably wouldn't know any of this shit
a million dollars
what kind of lifestyle like player player
okay
that's gay
this is this
wait is he still with the same guy
until now
not that I care lah but
err
err my question is right
what is that guy doing
tool
hold up jack's is the okay ya then
wait which again the one at ang mo kio
oh really wait there there's a jack's in ang mo kio meh
no okay that one I know already it's that one wait is that is that one still around
wait so it's it's an affiliate of jack's ah it's like one of the sister companies ah
or like
okay lah fine
you know it doesn't take a diploma her his higher his esteemed diploma right from
were from whatever polytechnic right you know you you can you know work as a cashier at you know with
err less with less than qualifications right
he is aware of that right
oh how the tables have turned
hold up the boyfriend is rich still mooches off
your friend ah
so was that the turning point
for him turning homosexual
okay
mm you can't you can't put a you can't put a price on love right though
wei xiang two hundred range
hais oh my gosh
your friends right your friends are like
extra retarded ah for real
so joe rogan
that ethics of becoming an Instagram model
is there anything ethical is is there an ethical aspect right to being an Instagram model
because Instagram after all right is just a page where you put photos
I mean ultimately ultimately right when it when it boils down to the you know like
common denominator type thing ah
it's just a web page it's just a page where you see photos
so is there and ethical ground right behind being an a model on Instagram
like what what constitutes ethics ah in
Instagram modelling like what you you have to
I mean like what like what you
be you you be super hot you take a photo right of you being hot right around starving africans
is that ethical
wait which one was it
no
probably because you didn't feed it to me
lies lies okay anyways
so is the sister the sister is
wait what okay fine ya okay ya ya
oh okay okay wait hold up hold up so
technically right technically he
he didn't he didn't flash
in a sense right in a sense right
he advertised himself right as he
he try to proposition for
ah for sex right for minors
from minors right with
by
know using using his fame ah not with paper ah
oh really
come with me in my videos
who is him dee kosh
would you want to know dee kosh
why not
so wait this is what gay privilege
oh wait hold up that amber
huh which finger
okay then
Tesla guy
the elon musk okay fine then
but to begin with right does he does he even know right that
those people are minors or not the his victims right
did he know that they were minors
okay
if that was the case right my question is
who are the people right who empower dee kosh
where does dee kosh derive right his fame from YouTube right who empowers him
is the youth of today
why
because right we're easily swayed we're easily we're easily swayed right by stupid shit
by simple stupid shit
to begin with also right
that's it
am I right to say am I right to say I can't remember what's the author's name ah err am I right to say right that
err the person who wrote catcher in the rye right
err the person in the catcher who wrote catcher in the rye right is a influencer
because he influenced the guy to go and assassinate the the kennedy
you know kennedy ya
ah ah okay oh my goodness ya john lennon ya
to influence them to do what
okay
but Instagram by itself right but but Instagram by Instagram by itself right
is just a platform only ah is the people is to me right
to me if you ask me personally right I would say that it's the kids of today ah it's
the young impressionable kids of today right who are so drawn into
nonsense antics right who
who follow this guy ah who give this guy a following who
in return right he generates he generates revenue right from
err you know from uh from his
the the legions the legions from his legions of ah from his
no the legions of followers that he has uh uh okay I'm being sarcastic lah about the legions lah cause I don't think he has
he got he got himself into he got himself into
into this kind of into this kind of nonsense then to amplify this to amplify the
situation right on a personal on I guess on at
face value level type
thing ah he
you know he makes a living he he makes a living talking about people mah and also like talking to
see what happened lah the tables have turned the tables have turned already ah the tables have turned lah err it
come it kind of like goes to show right that
you're not as smart as you think you are lah you probably didn't plan
you probably didn't plan your you didn't have a contingency for backlash ah
you didn't you didn't see you you couldn't possibly see right you're just so considered you're so considered right in your
five them ah that you didn't
everybody you know everybody ah has
everyone has skeletons
everybody has skeletons including yourself you know everybody has skeletons but now you make
you make the profession ah you make a living you know by by make a living ah you
earn money eh to feed yourself you know not now I we don't talk about other people ah you feed yourself right with
with
err talking very poorly talking down on people err pointing out people's mistakes and all uh and all that you know
everybody does this you know you know gossipping right
girls gossip also what we are doing now right is actually gossipping ah we're gossipping about other person
but your but I think it's important right that
we have to gossip truthfully you know we have to gossip truthfully
now ah even if we don't gossip truthfully even if we don't gossip truthfully eh
he he puts it online ah he he
in in a sense right he broadcast it he broadcast his opinions his opinions on people and then
look what has happened ah like
most of the singaporean singaporean celebs lah I kind of like hate all of them
the one with the skinny malay guy
ah nicole seah
not nicole seah what's her name
the nicole choo is really not doing anything wrong you know dee kosh eh is dee kosh and
I guess ah uh dee kosh right is really being being a straight up
err straight up douche oh err in a is being a straight up douche ah because
those irritating irritating nonsense eh on err they do irritating nonsense right then they upload it on YouTube
knowingly right post it on social media then everybody were to know
you can go ahead and comment lah but then again when it comes to when it
it's err it's too it's too malicious ah like
it's it's really too it's really too malicious already ah like
err like for me for me right the videos eh
her work probably isn't really that
isn't isn't that great ah because like from the looks of it right she's not really that deep ah to in in all honesty she's not
she she's not that deep ah like the you know
my heart right my heart ah the the abyss that is my heart right is probably is probably deeper ah
that she did right is
she
she kind of like jams
jams YouTube with her shit ah
like I I don't want I don't want to watch this this is this is
this doesn't do anything for me
this doesn't do anything for me
no
like TikTok and all this you know like I don't get the concept of TikTok you know I get the concept of Vines you know I get the concept of Vines
I just don't understand the concept of TikToks
it is
so I'm an I I'm an anomaly ah
yes

when he boils down to you know like
basically
what does he do like seriously what does he do what does he do right what does he do

think I don't
I don't listen to jian hao tan kan I don't listen or watch or tune in to dee kosh or jian hao tan or any one of these like
I I genuinely I genuinely just don't ah because
like for for myself right I don't see I don't see any form of
err I don't see them as as men right I don't see them as masculine
I'm I'm not buff you know I'm I'm incredibly fat but in all honesty I think that I'm more mescaline than they are
on the exterior right I think that I'm
what skills that what skills right do they possess right that
err that
they don't have survival skills okay ya lah they make they make money they make money out of
they make money err on YouTube entertaining people lah but besides that
okay what influence
ya but the but but
if you ask me also right they are not but you ask me also
I mean obviously this is this is this is subjective lah
less than sixteen years old err maybe
is like
from age one
to
probably nineteen or those forty or fifty year old right who have the minds of nineteen year olds
no respect

ah
a'ah
lah
ya
oh my god
syarif syarif malaque eh oh okay

ya correct ya I mean nobody really turns on the
no
ya so it's like err I I mean I don't know is it cause it's very peachy
ya that one was quite interesting
ya
ya like just inner noise
right
cause I think now we have netflix right I don't like the idea of having to oh okay I have to watch this show at a specific timeslot like who got time for that you know
ya like what okay let's go says ah which is very true everything is on demand
ah
oh my goodness
I mean ya it's true I mean if you think about it like what one in three malay people in singapore listens to right
or something like that
I'll try to put my phone
K K I put my phone here okay ya
oh ya what finance
oh yes yes yes cool
oh a partner
oh err wait

ya
sounds good
ah
okay
ya
pessimistic as in about your relationship
uh huh uh huh
okay as in like what kind of things are you pessimistic about
oh okay okay
ya
okay what is the thing that you want to do more of like you think you haven't achieve yet
monetary
or like but but then like to me it's like what's the point of just having a number there right like you can have hundred K in like in in like asset
ya
in general but I don't know I still think hundred K feels feels like very little but what can you do with hundred
you bought a house what
ya correct
but then how how would you okay I I mean if you think about it logically how would anyone earning like a normal pay for around thirty years old I think most people are earning between what four to five K around there
ya or or unless like you're a real high flyer ya and then
ya correct
ya exactly but then it depends
but like I I mean like if a normal office job that's about as much as you can go unless you already start off you know as a
ya
mmhmm
ah
ah
I don't know but ros also
oh like you yourself okay
mm mm
mm
okay okay I think
I think it's cause of the industry as a whole lah also
there's a lot of uncertainties there with the flying and all I mean with the aviation industry like this
cause if if let's say any normal given day then you know everything would be going smoothly what it's you know what can happen
huh
a'ah
ya
what oh no but eh five hundred plus that means how much you put down your deposit you take twenty percent is it of the cost
twenty five percent
hundred
hundred K ya lah there's your savings
dope okay lah hundred plus
okay eh then okay eh not so bad eh hundred plus
then the rest of it finance through what bank loan ah is
but is but six hundred plus K right the the cost price of your condo
mm
mm mm
okay
then you you put down about hundred plus lah
mm
ah ah
ah
ah
to to to pay off your loan okay so I watched like this video right they say if let's say the interest of your loan is below three percent just
pay it off slowly ya don't even bother ya but if let's say the interest on your loan is more than three percent than ya you should pay it off as soon as possible
ya this is
ya
so what is the final amount like what's the max you have to pay per month
one thousand plus
but then part of it will come from kan
ah okay okay can lah
then how then see how
but then you you're not really planning to stop working after getting married right

ya he he has his moments lah but he's becoming so naughty ya ya he like just the other day he falls off the bed tau
ya did he he he rolled off the bed
ya
so now we are trying to put him on the mattress
then you know I started baby proofing my house
ya so got the baby lock lah you know by the drawers you have to ah pull out and things like that ya but hanan figured it out like he plays with the hook
then he he he saw me doing it and then he copied
that is wishful thinking
okay lah
eh can you hear me clearly
okay good good good ya this earpiece is a lot better than that stupid airpod keep running out of battery lah
I didn't know this one got okay this is just ya correct
I can even
this is xiaomi
it's only twenty dollars
unlike the airpod which was like what three hundred
ya I think he's buying I want to buy this type too
I already got the job lah
like I mean you know they they like like on the website like I've already been rejected from all the other applications
but one is still open like still pending pending approval so just wait lor it is what it is it takes a very long time
ya and I really want that job though
ya but ya lah I'm also scared but at the same time
for the position is
it's compliance manager
ya
so I hope they pay well
yes yes jannah was the one who suggested yes

she should go
ya
she should go cause her sisters also going
oh my gosh
but her sister got degree
oh oh oh
okay
mmhmm
mm ya
mm mm
ya correct
ya
the house is a better investment ya correct
eh actually you don't need lah you don't need the degree yet you know why people use the degree to buy a house not the other way round
like you know people go get a degree so that they can afford to buy a condo not you already have your condo then you use your condo to partially finance your degree I mean like what's the point you know you've already achieve that
ya lah
ya which is ya which is which which I get it ya
ya ya I mean I totally get that lah but you can also do that after you have kids or do it with your kids in future
I don't know
but ya lah a degree is ya I don't know I don't know if it's pointless or what but ya I wish I wish I went through the
I think right it's more about the experience like you have in school like if you were a part of a campus at then I feel it's really worth it
that to me ah
and then they teach you
ya lah around there lor
that is what for one year only right twenty three twenty three K
eighteen months
actually okay what right
eh but come
ah ya true ya true true
ya that's true plus you are also getting married
ya ya ya ya
but don't do anything you don't want to do
you know
but now you realised that hey actually my life is pretty good right unmarried not not married
and then you are not sure by getting married it will make your life better or worse like would you even feel empty if you're not married
you know what I mean
ya
mm mm
there is there is
no of course there's going to be a very good reason to get married
you
ya
ya ya ya it's a perfect size and width
mm mm
okay okay
ya mmhmm
ya
like I would go and save and look for couple massage and then buy right
but he splurged like five hundred plus okay then
ah
okay
wah
okay okay
a'ah
a'ah ya like the what the wave okay
ah
ah ah ah ah
ah nice and where did you guys go for dinner
nice
as in ros booked the restaurant okay
mm okay okay
mm
so he cancelled the other one
nice pretty nice
aww so nice then what what you packed
like you packed like the clothes for the day
huh
cute seh
you know I trust him now
that's good that's good
ya
which is I mean to be fair also it's hard for him lah how is he going to talk somebody like robert right who's been in your life for so long
ya slowly in future to your family
ya lah I know
what what what about him does she wish would be better
that's good lah
there's a I do there isn't but ya she just decided that okay lah just let them live their life
you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna interfere
then after that he's like why you so rude ah I don't want to go lah then he called his sister and said oh I'm I'm not going already then I have to go lah I went out with his family
and my sister-in-law and hanan
ya I was so angry but you know cause
and they they so excited seh they want to go out with hanan
hais
I want I'm trying to trying to so it's like
it's like on and off then you see on my instagram I'm not wearing ya
it's something that I want to try and do but we will see lah inshaallah lah and I keep getting deliveries to my door
he thought that all these deliveries
I ordered online on shopee and then after that I compare it with the slightly more expensive one and and totally the same okay
ya
I bought like of shopee lah like um you know the the non iron one
like the crepe material ya but then after that I also got a lot of hand me down
ya the line line one
then my sister my sister has a lot what so they also give me some
ya cause both both my sisters are wearing already so they helped me lah they helped me put it on and stuff teach me
ya
ah
no no no no it's not that
ya he just finds that he just finds my colour combi totally off
his family I mean his sister asked me lah I told his sister lah the truth
ya I think he just bad day they also know what that he
a bit
ya
like he got his temper
ah ya I told I told his sister ya
ya
hais
ya lah this is
eh you know that used to be me but now I'm like haiya I really cannot be bothered like I cannot be bothered by a lot of things
ya
he's okay if cause for hanan right I make sure he he he he is exposed or like he can see people without me around
so actually hanan is not very attached to me at all he can be with my mother he can sleepover and then after that he can go over my mother-in-law then he sees his paternal side grandparents he's okay he's like perfectly fine
he's not clingy
I think ya
ya I I cause I know eventually I want to go to work what
ya ya correct so I need him to not be so attached to me it's for his own good also lah but at the same time he's very clingy to his father cause he knows that his father is like he totally see daily
ya like hidayat will only come back only at night then he don't get to see him cause he will see him for a short period of time in the morning before work
ya
then he he will cry you know he will be like at the door
when his father goes off to work
ya he understands
ya lah but I love it cause he's such a smiley happy baby
ya I just hope he gonna be fine
like he won't feel like he won't
then today right I'm going to make stocks for him
I'm going to make chicken stock and vegetable stock from scratch
but like plain
no salt no what
now um next week ah
ya
ya hopefully
maybe
huh I really don't believe so cause the first one it feels like life is still to support them
you know what I mean
ya
it's like motherhood will never end
hais
ya
the only one for a long time
oh my gosh
ya so he
he's going to do it at furama err this girl is from she's doing ah I think it's his schoolmate or something
ex schoolmate so she studies biomedical sciences
ah
cause of the cause of the way he responds
the girl the girl is works in a lab so she does
I don't know she tests things she run she's the ya she does research
nazreen is an engineer so he works in the east so he does he's like my sister lah they she they studied mechanical engineering
ya
he's been working a while
ya I saw the girl stays in the east
they they will stay stay with each other for a while la while they look for resale
ya so cause nazreen works in the east so they going to stay with the girl likely
ya but then the girl works at so you imagine
huh serious
serious
mm mm
plus the set up all that which which is okay I I don't know I thought ya but then I think my degree was cheaper so but they got they got back quite a bit lah so in the end
ah
as in like okay lah
eh but still
you don't have to worry so much about the guests you can just
slowly take your time
mm
ya fifty is too little already
you cannot that means it's really just family lor
right if it's fifty your aunties and uncles already dah fifty people plus your cousins
ya

it was okay lah but he comes across as very chauvinist
ya like
like I think he respects her but
he also questions her a lot
ya
but then he also talks about her what like in other podcast he will say like oh you know like if I have a girlfriend we must respect we must then everybody knows what his girlfriend is aisyah aziz
like hello

and the chemistry is just not there right
like
mm ya maybe maybe but if you notice even during interviews it is dzar who carries the conversation right with the
people like razz will
a'ah
ya correct
correct correct correct
so actually dzar can go out on his own and make his own podcast
no lah
din doesn't add to the conversation I feel like he will just ask one question and then after that oh okay
no wonder he doesn't have like his own viewpoints to chime in you see at least dzar has like so many things to say right and he always makes the conversation more interesting

so there's like
what is it is it water and
no no don't touch me there don't this is my no no square square
no no don't touch me there this is my no no square
a random question you know what is like you know what is really out of this world ah these questions like literally out of this world
if you
could be
an animal what would you be and why have we
I don't know I'm still thinking of my answer now
a giraffe
that is so unlike your current scale
yes
reaching yes
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya they're like very different than other animals but also elephants are quite different
have you elephants much or more loving detail
ya that what I was thinking
eh
just over there
mm
I think I want to be like
like a bird but I don't know what species of bird for now
because I want to fly fly like I think the view will be
I mean
it's just the idea of like freedom like you can go everywhere
high fly
bungee jump
I have never I am scared but also I want to try
but I am scared
but I can do roller coasters
you are strapped
but actually bungee jump also lah
you are strapped
yes
because like it's
it's not tight in the first place it's only tight when like you reach
the ground
ya
but I want I also wonder like how clouds really feel like you know
so like as I am
what
so I wonder if like if I'm a bird like I can feel it in my wing
slip blowing and below my feathers
they are just raindrops
I'll never know I will never know this
have you ever wondered why must we suck
how
ah how
no so like there's I think there's this movie
ah about this spy that turned into a
pigeon apparently pigeons can see three hundred sixty degrees so they can literally see
their butt and the front at the same time oh wow yet
amazing ah
but also I think that's like very useful
like for like like
like seeing whether their predators know ya predators around
in survival camp massive human sadness
can you imagine if humans like that
then like you cannot hide anywhere so people cannot back stab you
want to stab yes
oh please ah
ya
I can be anything I want
I want to break free
wah what would I want as in do I want to be a non-living thing
I don't know meh
but I guess a non-living thing can also be anything they want
like once they they can be recycled but they don't get a choice
you don't get a choice it's like something else is
mm
as long as I don't become like floor tiles in in the bathroom
so like a apple apple tree
I don't know I've never thought about this
okay what do you want to be
what do you mean
like a super super power like a superhero
um I don't even have to have a superpower taffy mention
like you don't grow old
oo and just excel in it
that would be cool then like my laptop wouldn't be smelling like matcha now
mm
that's good
but also like
but also like
ya
ya
yes
and don't see the need to like improve yourself because the first time you do it do it well ya
but if you can choose one important like superpower what would it be
like you only can have this one superpowers um
mmhmm
transportation eh
sure
it's at the back of my head
teleportation
ya I think I'd rather be I'd rather have teleportation because flying need still need to use energy
but literally we can just teleport anywhere you want
wendy
wizard of oz
might be wanda wanda fairy fairly oddparents
ya
and then she had to tap her legs like
what is one skill that you wanted to learn though
that you always want to learn but you haven't learnt yet
E two
investment
stock
stock trading
why would you want to learn that
but it's so like hectic though
I thought I will get migraine
but you
mind opening
ya
actually I don't know how it works also
but you have to call it and then like someone just get high ya I don't know
that is very fascinating
oo
nobody thinks about
what do I think about your
I think it's a cool skill to learn I'm not sure whether it will be useful
but
it's cool
ya
ya ya ya
that I want to learn
hmm
I feel like I'm quite talented
but I mean
of course there's a lot of things that I don't know also
I want to learn how to
do investments
no really really that's what I really want like I'm I'm very like because I feel like at this age
a lot of my friends are like doing investments and I don't how they know how to do it I don't know whether is self learn or like they have someone to guide them and I think I have a lot of conversations with
my other friends who also want to learn how to invest but we also like them clueless so I like I just want to know
how to do it and like or
like you know like
what are the right ways to do it lah basically right because right now like even if you go to youtube or like social media like a lot of people are saying a lot of different things so you don't know whether like and some more it's like it's using your own money
it's a bit scary
there's like a risk
losing money but they say that if you don't take risks you will never grow
ya
I mean I do have like
investments that I do with like my insurance company but that is they do it
but I want to learn it so that I can better manage my own money don't need them to manage it for me
I want to grow I want to grow grow grow
a'ah

like empty because you got
everything that you need
ya
ya
now what ya
I mean if I think about it lah it's a good life to live but
ya it's just managing your mental health
true

the only way you can train yourself to have a healthy mind is to always be open about your emotions and your thoughts
you cannot like keep it inside you once you keep it inside you
a'ah

first but then once nope I could be bitter at first but then once you reach the bottom I could be really sweet

ya ya my my house is uh reach half a million already like above
ya like above above ya
I mean like they of course they have thoughts of like moving lah but then
not at the moment
ya
four
cause it's very long already sia it's like
thirty over years
and
I think because it's not say accessible but then like it's like we live at central central
um maybe
I say like woodlands or what right it will take less than half an hour
ya but if like you go by bus or what usually
ya more than half an hour like forty minutes
ya then like my area there I think because like
I don't know
no not a lot of things I think because it's balestier so balestier like
I don't know ah
like the outside part lah
not my my inside part got a lot of like elderly
ya especially elderly ya
but that but that house like wow
eh what what
why were we talking about it just now
oh okay ya
so mm so I think if like other area
um
of course like if if there is I mean like executive I don't think it will be below
ya
ya
like I like go for it already seh
ya then I'll be like very lucky
ya so I would go with like six or seven
one million ah
dude that one I might as well I take landed right
actually landed and
if if okay if I were to take landed and
executive right I mean it's it's not really far apart what right
then if I were to like work even a bit more harder or wait longer then maybe I can get a good landed
eh
I mean that if like is what I want lah
ya
ya I think our area this the central central is like already
ya
ah
mm
okay
that's why ya
because like I mean like especially like in our generation right we will take even longer to like pay compared to our parents' time
ya I think our parents' time
ya
mmhmm ya ya ya standard
high already
well tomorrow I buy
ya oh my god
mm
golf club
oh
I think you can
mmhmm
uh then
billion ah oh that's wah
wah
means you would be the richest there already
I mean if you were to
ya
a pool of
ya oh my god
I don't think it will be a mini golf I think will be quite big already
ya I think you can like fit in a few houses
ya
you can have your own cafe there you can have your own like what arcade there oh my god
oh my god ya it will be so
mm actually
ya it's just it's just here lah because like you know here four room kan you can buy like a landed at
mm
mm I think so
ya that's why that's why people a lot go to melbourne ah
or go australia that area
considerable
then you get a garden a mini swimming pool I'm happy with that already
I'm happy with that
uh you like will confirm go eh like you know that you have a vacation like stay eh you can just like holler at me

and the house is like err landed at then said eh you guys want to um go we can go just stay at my house lah
okay sure okay lah why not right I mean like ya
ah then after that we just like ah nevermind lah we just find another time ya
then now like all busy so like
ya exactly exactly
don't know lah when that time
the but that time like almost lah then after that like
alone eh because err the parents
err
was held back because they were supposed to go back for like some event
then after that she have to like go first then the parents um err
left her behind lah I think no ah I think she was with the sisters
ya but I but she say that time she go first then the parents because the parents drive
so like
so it's like
ya I mean like it's best if like you know we can go with her then like
hmm but then ah
ya I I think everyone will like
bye singapore no no population sia
every time all all like go to malaysia
ya
but but in order to I feel like in order for us to like live a good life in malaysia
like we need to work in singapore
like our income must be from here then then we can live a good life there
unless you work very hard there lah but then it's hardly also to see
ya true
cost of living if retailers you could do as I knew
it's like the same like we live um staying in singapore ya
it's like times three of what we earn know
imagine if you earn one K and there is like three K
mm
mm
ya
mm
mmhmm
woodlands so ah
ya
mmhmm
at
oh oh singapore oh okay
ah
ya ya
ya ya ya
no in the investment
ah ya
exactly like easy money ah like that ya
it's like um you know in when I was in uh in
like a few of my officer
that have like around err four room or three room
four room or three room then
after that uh
they they but they don't they never stay at that house
so they rent out to people rent rent to people ah so that one house eh
eh one I think one room eh
they charge um
ya they charge
I think one K
ya they charge around one K one K plus
so imagine and and full know full it's like okay that four room eh
okay so it's three room one hall right so that three room is occupied
then one person imagine one person is one K plus if I'm not wrong
then wah then really then he like doing for like four years already now then imagine how
how how much he get already in one year then plus his pay
then then he even like talk to me saying that oh I actually thought of like you know getting another condo
ya but I don't think I'll be living there lah I will rent to people also then I like wah
so much things to carry
ya but then like the money is good lah then like okay my that
that officer of mine is not okay is married but don't even have a child yet
so like
and he's like old already so I don't know if like they want to have a child or not lah
so I don't know like ya with that a lot of money what is he going to do with that
ya
freehold no
mmhmm mm
this for condo
some some of it ah
wah
mm can take over and stuff like that ya
mmhmm
ya
ya ya ya true wah
mm
mmhmm
what kind of like job they do like middle family because some some of them
is is for you actually you know it's though it's a gift or something like that then from there they like make it even bigger
ya you know like I want ya it's a I think like
um
some of like err my friends
like they they they mentioned
um what is that
like their family has a asset
actually I think for them or something like that so so they actually um
their their parents only get to
err release that thing
err to what is it
oh sorry like a lot of things going on in my mind
a lot a lot of things going inside the room
okay
okay so okay I let me restart
good family
ah ya so like their parents actually like put aside or keep this savings of theirs
like uh for them so at a certain age then uh it will be uh released to them or something like that
ya so it's like
so so for example right now they work right they work hard already they earn like so much already
then at uh one point of time
you would they would get this money
but then this money is either is up to them lah what what they want to use it as
so
uh
so
ya lah they
um
they they have plans they already planned what they want to do with that money
oh that one I don't did I ask them
ya I don't know lah they say like at a certain age I think they also don't know I think I don't know
so like ya
err there's nothing over here what is it ah
ah
then
then suddenly aman need earpiece
my earpiece oh is it this one is it your earpiece this one
oh ya about tell eh do what
oh well
inside the container
inside the container container is this the container
black colour
black colour below one
orh
where is let me see before you give it to him okay
sorry it's okay bye bye
bye
then
then
and after then mm ya lah I think there's a lot of like then and then and uh so and so
ya
ya so so he already plan out lah like what he want to do with the money it's either he
uh buy a like a big house or he start on his own business
not most lah I mean like a few I mean like uh I have this few friends only so like
most of them okay I just say most of them like um plan to do like a business
or like maybe like go like overseas or something like um like their business is like
to ah
to
err overseas lah so like
it's just that they need
the the time to like get their money and then right that's it
it's like how our parents wait for their
but this one is like even
ya and you don't have to wait for that age
to get it ya you know
I think like
like when you reach like adult like mature mature adult age ah then they will like receive the money or something like that when like the parents know that
oh they can
they are mature enough to handle the money lah
ya that they don't even think
ya they don't even think of like what job they want to do after like or like you know they they like oh nevermind lah just we uh see how it goes
I'm like we see how it goes
I see where I go
like ya it's like you never know like they like oh okay lah see lah I think I think my father um
the the the friend
um uh son got a business so they thought of like you know just uh taking me in and work for them then um like everything is like already there the choice are there so they just need to choose
them I'm like wah so pampered one ya
so ya I think this uh I mean like most of these people
they'll they will like mostly do this kind of like investment or what lah
ya
see their background lah
ya
exactly
then like they don't have to like really stress or like put pressure
ya
ya
mmhmm
exactly
mm
just nice
mmhmm
mmhmm
degree degree
actually right
okay continue nevermind
mm
ya
mmhmm
ya
mm different
it's like it's like let's say like if you
in diploma right
then you have to work like extra to reach
to reach um the degree pay
ya then for degree
will just like that
then
degree itself is already like
sufficient you know
I mean
I don't know actually diploma is quite sufficient already
just that whether
um
ya because like I feel like because uh I have this uh conversation lah with my um
senior
like he's doing teaching
so he's not um under err not really under
ah private or something like that but he go to schools lah to conduct
the classes so like
then with that time that money that you earned you actually can like do a lot with it
so like like he do a lot of like um he just keep on doing like uh freelancing and like volunteering work and like just like
to
increase his err rapport or something like that
you get um what is that
ah
ya then after that he just like sign up for this one thing then that that thing that requires like degree
recommendations also lah and all so like he said like ya actually you just need to hustle on that I mean if you want a easy way but
the the going through process is like hard
ah then you take degree lah I mean like degree also now
like I feel like
ah
I mean it's good lah I mean it's good it's definitely good for like future because like even like when you are at work age or what right if you want to do something
it's like
uh like a bonus point ah oh okay okay this this person got a you know
like experience in this you know
ya that's why I was like thinking then like hmm but then of course um I want to do degree lah but
see lah how it goes
oh my god
uh as at that time I check
it was for one year eh for one year degree is around two five
two five
two five thousand
ah if for that one year
for that one year
ya because um half of the year
it's um overseas
uh labrador labrador
labrador park
I don't know uh uh I know what's the it's at uh australia eh
I don't I I don't know what's that
ya then like
but it's like so crammed lah like they say that there's no time then you have to do like
thesis and essays and such like that and then it's like not not like a few hundreds you know it's like thousands of words
ya I mean like ya lah of course lah but this one is like you have to do like
singapore one set then at the overseas one set and you just imagine that
then like wah but really like hustling ah then that's not
the only one then they have to rush for their
project works ya project works then like their on come eh accommodations over there
ya I mean it's paid lah it's paid but like our expenses and some of other things you need to use your own money
so like wah
so that's why people like sometimes use bank loan and stuff like that
which is like scary lah
ya
then what when you want then after that imagine after your degree you have to pay back
there's that
exactly then
thirty plus lah late thirties
means that the older you get the the older you get your
the older you get
okay
I mean like when you want to give birth the older you get
the harder it is I mean like the guy
this one about mental you know and emotional ah
emotional and mental um
don't know because of what maybe because of health issues because you're getting older or what
then
eh you can't continue continue eh continue the tradition or the the the
ya
I mean like both their different
uh pros and cons um a different
ya
mm
mmhmm
I mean it's okay if like the girl is like younger
ya
mm it's okay lah
ah lah ah lah
I mean it has been like that for the longest time lah ya
wah then that one I like really have to chiong you know I mean like
ya it doesn't matter like age doesn't matter lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
ya slack off
ya
mm
because of how you take the things lah ah how you like actually
uh handle the situation
ya like more more like career minded
ya
the pride ya
ya ya
ya
ya
maybe it's a trend also where people hire more females
they are more towards the towards towards the career path
ya I mean like before before this generation already like
towards the career path lah
where be like the economy and such right so
mm mmhmm mm ya
ya
true lah
mm
I'll be like
ah that's the thing
as in like ah saving plan
but it's also like hard lah I mean like how if that if you get like one
ya
ya
mm
mm
mm
then how seh like that
mm ya mm
some like uh my friend
err
and be eh
two point five ya two point five then after that
ah got commission so let's say if like she
uh managed to like err sell something or this um particular plan or what eh to another company or what to an event
then she will get a commission of like another what one K plus or two
just imagine then wah she bring home how many already then like
then during this circuit breaker
like she still get her pay
but then um they give her more
she need to do extra
so usually like okay because like okay
the numbers of like uh workers also will cut down what
then after that the one that is being uh cut off
have have already have the thing to do so that that thing that the commission that the person has to do is brought forward to my friend
so she had to do double job in a way
ya so imagine like with her pay
okay lah her pay got uh drop lah dropped by a few percent only like not much
they've wasn't too which is cheaper
ah
I mean like if she get to sell um that's what the the pay pay the standard pay
mmhmm
so she have her own one and uh the friend commission
oh you mean uh the commission extra
yes
ya ya
mm
mmhmm
ah
like that ah
ya it's it's it's not it's not they combined the workload
so it's like macam if if combined also like if she managed to sell one thing
then she will get commission that one thing then if
if she go to the next list if she get to sell that next list then she will get another commission that kind
get what I mean
ah
so like now now she bring home like around okay
around three plus three plus four
err because like the err company really like cut into half
so so they have like two they they only have two um
two groups two groups of managing something
so now that one group
uh that two group is being cut into half and then they combine these two groups in a way
so it's like
because their their workload is doubled ah so of course their pay also in a way
doubled ah
amazing eh
like you like your leave you cannot just
then it like you really need to
ya but then she know ya that's why
but then she knows that
she need um income right so she stayed for a bit that's why the commission come in but then she say lah she say to the boss that
oh um you know um my my family is my first priority so if anything happen like if you need me
like last minute and I already have
uh a family thing or what
I will
I will not take up the work I will take up I will still stick to my uh family ya
they having this uh conversation and like this um argument and it's like about this thing ah then she said I'm so sorry I mean like
but then they know that they can't lose her
cause once they lose her then
no one would do that ah exactly
so they like try to like
what is that called accommodate lah
so like okay lah
then then in the end I don't know what happened but then she's still uh working there
but she said that she won't be err staying lah I mean like when when the COVID
thing gets better then like the pay don't get better then maybe like she'll go to another company or something like that but then again
the pay is already like
you know I mean I I won't I won't be
complaining ya
ya I mean if I would get that much pay and
I mean I already got the chance to like say um stay I never be like cut off then I really got like
then my pay in a way like increased because of the commissions
then like why why would I want to like complain even though that work is hard ah
ya
your what is that called
yes
getting better at this
ya a lot a lot
so
ya
that's why I think a lot of like people now want to like work really hard
and like have a stable life
will not have a
to go through like this uh
this like like what
we go through in a way but we don't know lah in in time to come like how it is like
a fellow let's say the future
ya exactly
but ya lah just that
I feel that now uh people work extra hard so at least they have something
to keep like in their that box
their treasure box
dead
their death box ya
so like really you really don't don't touch even like
even if got emergency also I don't I think they will try not to touch that money
I mean like unless
if the emergency is really emergency
ah
because because I know err I think err my my relative eh
so uh this saving eh that they have eh is for like emergency for like maybe
okay
urgent emergency
ya
eh don't be surprised I had my relative that got married at my age she going
she's the one like that you know
ya her her wedding supposed to be in two years
but that simple simple also need money what
then after that okay she have savings she have already have savings but then it's not enough
for that one year
weird okay
okay and they do not not together know like husband and wife
they do two separate wedding
so like the guy's side in a way I think is stable is okay
amazing but still like it's like lah I mean like
then then the mum on that day itself the mum was like telling us like
ah then after that into the point where uh where the mum have to step in the mum like
but she already
know that that thing will happen so she and the husband actually put aside and the father is actually very strict
then okay then that's a
that's why the father didn't know lah so of course the mum need to like mm twist here and there you know to make things like better
ya so like ya ah then the mum was like saying hais ah then this one also I have to like hmm
whole thing lah
so like if if the mum never help that wedding didn't happen actually
ya exactly I mean like you you I mean like throughout your life already like
burden already you know and then you have to err burden someone unless if your mum like your parents really want to fork out
like you know or help out ah
ah that is okay I mean it's like you know
ya it's like a gift lah a gift
ya
mm then okay lah ya
mm
ya
mm mm mm
ya I think it's
even my brother want to get married like want to make small small then she like
because like you know uh so we can invite more people like like her friends then he like stress
uh I think combine because the girl's family is a small family
because and she live in um
she has a family in malaysia and singapore so she she technically a
ya because she stays there
only she come here to work and also to meet the families here lah
and she have a family in singapore lah because I think the father or the mother is a singaporean
like not big so like so of course she said that she will only invite like those
like close one ah like the family in singapore lah
then that that that means right he really want to have a intimate wedding so with his side of place
then my mum like oh this is too squeezy then then later if I invite my friend like you know like mum's thinking like you want like you would want the friends to like
to share the happiness with the friends
then like he say but then who's getting married
he said ya then he like try to accommodate lah then my mum
try to understand also
but okay lah I mean like
different people different lah ah
ya like they they they know that okay uh this wedding
uh I want to do this for my child know I want to contribute err this part of the wedding you know for my child you know that kind of thing
ah renovation because like they are like getting older so like there are things that needs to be changed or what kan
like my this err aunty set like err
this big amount lah
ya but
mm
ya that's the thing
like some people join what this err what is that called
so after less interview of time
ya uh I mean no as in like every month if you like you pay
ah at a certain age then you can get the money the whole sum of money
ah
mm
mmhmm
mm
but err the but uh it's hundred fifty times twenty five
times the months lah
orh
mm
I think they have different different like
mmhmm
ya
but if sometimes like people know just have to go to another way
just to like
ya like like not not say illegal lah I mean like like legal
but it's riskier
uh I don't know
ya
ya I mean if you think that it's okay okay ah
ya
mm
mm ya
but this cannot be shared with you
um children ah if you if you have children
like this saving things you should not err I mean like
maybe
ya
until like they reach a certain age or what ya because it's scary because like they can you never know what will you know what they would what you expect them to do like
ya

a friend
but okay lah okay lah I
but then karina karina squishy lah bro but then
okay karina squishy
like at the start I always noob right then confirm at the start they will already say
a man of it the toxicity is not as bad as it was before oh but then ya and bangkok lah stop being a chicken dilemma
not bad not bad
the toxicity is not as bad as it was before but then ya
and
rank up lah stop being a chicken alamak err
where got I feel that level that time I saw you play okay what
okay what
okay the fact that you actually smash buttons I thought you actually did your research but I thought you nailed out on freya but okay
unfriend
okay lah
I keep on saying okay lah sia but okay
what okay lah
the rank the rank
I'm not judging I'm not trying to do it now but the fact that you already did a lot of research and thing it's a progress you can go up and up and up but
if you want to stay start then okay
win win the chicken dinner
invincible eh but if you want play fighter right I feel that okay there's this new fighter called yu zhong yu zhong
whatever
have another fighter eh but since you say you play freya freya right
freya freya has
why am I not surprised I am never surprise when it comes to this but
eh I really didn't know about the health spinning thing tho
wah okay okay cause right there was this like my team that time I play alone then I play with this one person
it's okay you can
you can you know improve that that ulti so instead of hitting minion you will hit
maybe three or four player you know
ya then
yet eh masha is not a tank masha is a is a fighter
ya I cannot tank
would you could that the
excuse me excuse me
eh walao I mean like okay I suck at new new heroes okay so like you know I'm I'm already comfortable with the heroes that I have
ya so it's like
ah
it went there there there there there it's okay
there there there there there it's okay
I mean it's true sometimes in life nah I don't know what to say cause like I ain't no therapist unlike you
but eh but if you play hilda or what then I just support you lor
but I'll be there okay I'll be there I'll be playing my marksman or my
ya
eh what other what other tank eh I feel that hylos also not bad eh
it's for you
ya hylos like ya
ya hilda and during
draft pick right they also
ya ya legit legit like they always did
or tank just odd ah and there's no one who'd ban hilda
so I think there's a good chance you can
but ya ya
they they ban uranus actually I played uranus before it's quite fun but
the surprising right they don't really much new players ya they bend your illness because actually you organise is a very thick thing
surprisingly right they don't really ban much new players
they ban uranus
cause actually uranus is a pretty thick tank
once in a while they will ban ling
ah ling
who they ban who I forgot
but now kan instead of two
they ban three each so each team ban three
so total six
players six heroes away ban
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes okay I really want andes I really want the fiery chicken oh my god okay I'm salivating
let's go find this but lunch lah
best pe
or like eh I'll be late
oh ya eh but wah the leave oh he's taking he'll be taking two days leave ah
okay now I feel very bad
ya whole day leave
lunch
no we're not bringing our rice cooker
oh
that's not happening okay we're not gonna repeat that
I can't really we bought a rice cooker for a staycation
okay this is such a
such a
feisty thing to say out loud
yes we bought rice cooker for our staycay previously and it was so it was so handy I admit though I mean come on man you gotta admit that it's very handy dandy
it's like what we cook maggi we cook pau we steam pau some more leh
okay okay no but we're not going to bring that rice cooker for sure
because over there right they already provide us with pots and pans
but ya we're not going to bring rice cooker
and no I'll make sure you don't bring your
freaking luggage
that's not going to happen because it's just
it's three days two nights so we're not going to have
a lot actually
I take that back I think I'm going to bring a lot of stuff also
luggage
okay okay then we
eh but the thing is we're going to eat lunch outside
dinner
it will be side tracked again actually in a way sort of
okay maybe not really
because right
okay I don't know
I'm actually imagining it right now
okay the fact that oh my god
haizat he fully endorsed it
I'm questioning our friendship why why are we friends with these kind of people
but
ya I wanted to mention that
pathetic
no I'm not going to do that
so it's like
the waking up though do you think
you think we will wake up easily
you nasty
okay lah if you don't you nasty
okay day two
in the morning we going to prepare some breakfast
okay it doesn't matter the order and then we going to do we're going to trampoline park
after trampoline park we're going to be all sweaty and disgusting we're going to go eat
I haven't do my research on that I ya I'm not as on as you
there's also I found one in ang mo kio before but I mean from here to ang mo kio is a bit like um but ya I thought if oh I know I know three one three lah
bounce kan ya bounce is there I don't know but we'll do research on that
but ya we can go there
eh but there's no shower place also right around the area I think we just change our clothes
then I just hope zat don't tell us to you know
go back to
you go grab home go back grab
but then like at the same time I feel like I want to fully utilise that
ya
eh I ya to what as in like you are indeed very correct because why why go out when you can stay in inside a cosy little
container with aircon with all the things you need like
youtube netflix
what why go out okay lah I mean okay we're such a
party pooper
ya but
hmm
I was speaking of grab I mean coming from someone who reaches
an hour earlier than the meeting time every time
okay you
so it's like I mean I'm not even surprised if your account is not even gold
or silver to be honest or bronze
or below bronze but anyway
I'm so on to stay in container also
but at the same time okay if activity mm
if cheap and nearby I don't mind but it's at promenade promenade I don't know it's that far meh
I think okay you know what we just see if there's any like places nearby in prom line problem is it depends ah okay so the first option
first
first ten
first day
we just
stay inside
second day stay inside third day stay inside that's the first plan second first day we eat
go up and trampoline
go out and trampoline
on the first day I mean okay the first plan right it includes the gym also
because technically we don't go out what it's just that we go to the gym nearby the container gym anyway
ya we go outside which is first day we go
we don't we we stay in lah we stay in then second day then we go trampoline park then after trampoline park we can go back to the container
I don't know what other activities we can play
I mean even if we two car bejewelled and everything we stable soap mah like we still feel very icky instead okay ya then
ya
then
ya or we can go cow play cow moo first or wherever lah that first activity that we do and then we go trampoline park
and then we end the day with
going home for going to the going back to your container for dinner or we just buy dinner then we dabao to container
do not talk about my winx club like that winx club
that's not a very nice of you okay that's very mean move what's wrong with watching that I mean you watch barney you watch other stuff also so okay like cartoons are cartoons they are like entertaining
oh excuse me every single time I refer something about spongebob you be like oh I know that one you sure you don't talk much okay don't talk so much
if you don't watch spongebob and it's all memory based then how did it came about that means you did watch spongebob
excuse me sir are you judging all those people that are watching my little pony
no but the thing is right
the thing is our staycay we haven't even finish talking
you know what

and my name is haziqah
and I'm twenty five we are ten years apart and we are sisters
want to go first
so what is
by
ya
work is okay ah um just scanning the and taking temperature in the morning that's about it coronavirus is not going away
I hope the for now it's not that sucks
ya it's on nineteen june now today is what is it today ah
ya so two more days before friday woohoo and it's a friday night as well
so we don't know if we're gonna go out or just gonna stay home and do just things at home
how long is your
oh so you go back to school all the way
wow we're moving into phase two I don't know people say it's a bit too soon but I'm not sure if it is and also my friend has started like a group chat on whatsapp asking to meet like right after phase two
this weekend so I don't even know if it's safe to meet them yet cause I've been out in public for awhile now and I don't know if it's safe to meet my friends cause I don't want to put them at risk
ah the mask is so hot I can't even it's so bad like the cloth mask the first time that the government gave us was just a cloth mask they say it's breathable and washable reusable everything right but number one it's not breathable number two ya you can wash it it's it's like a garment but like
I don't know it does get stinky after awhile cause I use it everyday so I have to be consistently washing it quite often
wait so you still have physical education during this period
so what do you do if it's not in contact like what kind of sports do you play
interesting
you're using your mask as well right
she made it herself
oh I think I know what you mean it's the very big one
LOL
if you so hungry I think you have to dirty your cloth when it stinks
I think I think that's why people use the the disposable ones cause ah number one you can speak clearly can actually hear people cause it's very permeable like it's not even it's not even muffled when you speak then number two is like you can actually breathe because it's permeable you can breathe properly and everything not that I've tried it before but eh actually I did try before it's not bad at all
but it feels like you're not wearing anything feels like air which is I think that's why people will consider buying it like a box of it costs twenty five dollars it used to be twenty eight dollars for fifty pieces at and now it's twenty five so it's reduced but ya haven't really see a lot of people buying it
but I'm sure they do I'm sure they stock up as well so just imagine having eh a mask everyday I don't know if they change the mask everyday they like they wear like new ones everyday cause I don't think it's uh I don't think that it is uh economical sustainable and environmentally friendly
ya they even have the children size one I think your face might fit children one more than the big ones or like so awkward cause you are a teenager and you're not like an adult adult per se or you're not a child child so I think in terms of like okay maybe your face shape is more towards like child size cause it's small
ya it might not fit for you
ya that I think that's one of the reasons why I don't use it cause especially for work I have to speak to the customer who's coming in and say like oh hello good morning like greet them and then um scan their and direct them whether you know they can choose to either scan their or the code right to enter because the safe entry right either way it's still under safe entry which is a government website for contact tracing
so um ya it's just a lot more hassle when I have to use the the second mask that they gave us cause it's so muffled and it's just like there's no way I'm going to repeat myself ten thousand times just for them to hear me out like ya
I I don't know I've never sweat in that before but like oh my god it's the worst like I would never I can't even imagine wearing it sweaty like I wouldn't
ya I'm very curious like I have a few friends colleagues ah they all wear that disposal mask and I'm just wondering like how often do they actually use that mask
eh I don't know eh I think they might be just using the mask again and again and again
ya I was contemplating in buying like a new mask so so actually fit's my face nicely and like I don't know just something cause I wear it on a daily basis so it just makes sense for me to get a proper mask at least that that the ones that I'm comfortable with at the minute like the first one that the government give is still
a bit annoying cause I have to fold up the bottom bit cause it's quite long on my face my face quite tiny what not not even long like my face as in my face is not even long so like for me to wear that mask I just need to like fold it up
how what do you mean by you know what did she say
wow
so deep
ya I think ya I think when it comes to girls we have to be not trying to be sexist or anything but I think girls are a lot more dramatic they're they're a lot more sensitive not sensitive in a bad way but it's more of like they are emotionally driven so they do a lot of things out of like
either very difficult emotions to deal with so they lash out or they just kind of like keep it in and keep themselves numb or they just
ya they just throw shade on you and it's not it's not the best sort of like friendship you want to have especially when you're growing up in secondary school and like you wanna build that sort of cause you you sort of rely on your friends quite a bit for that companionship that sort of like drive to want
to do well in school as well cause like you you're not going to school just because of homework or school work or just enjoying some sort of like math lesson or like science or whatever but it's more because of your friends so ya I think choosing your friends are very important as well
very very important that social circle of friends is very important cause it help lift you up in times of like when you're stressed under a lot of pressure especially when you're doing O N level whichever right like they will be the ones that cheer you on cause you are in it together with them so you definitely need that support
I mean especially when it comes to exams ya you can't help to compare but I also think that like you know if you are quite upset about your grades you shouldn't impose them on others it's more of like you know you should be like eh well done like you pass maths like I haven't but like I will like I'm inspired by you because you passed maths and I haven't achieved that so I will do that for the next time
or you can just ask say because since you passed maths and I don't right take that as an example lor then you can always ask for help like there's no harm in asking for help or like just check with each other like if any of the questions that you actually don't understand and you actually got it right
you know
and I think you know just that peer sort of like support is also very important and I think that is one thing that the school needs to foster that sort of like culture instead of like being very competitive and be like aww you got a forty seven oh I got a fifty four so like I'm better than you
no I also think it puts like because of the education system here in singapore they put a lot of pressure on um students uh to get very good grades since since as young as we can remember studying like since nursery to kindergarten and then going on to even before that you might be child care you know
um and then you know we are expected because there's examination every per term or like every quarterly of the year then it kind of stresses on like the result very result driven more than like the process of like learning and understanding and why you are doing it rather
so you're only looking for results at the end of the day because that's what exams make you do so ya and I think having to try and unlearn that and re-cultivate sort of like a more healthier relationship with education and knowledge and learning
would be I would say is a challenge for the singapore system because I think we haven't really got it all even though we say we are like the top in the world and all that but you also do see a lot of like setback like you know
very
very troubled minds in terms of like mental health and like the emotional wellbeing of like the students especially kids when you're growing up all you need is like a lot a lot of like emotional support and if you don't get that I think it's very difficult for one of for them to like thrive
and like you're practically studying five days a week from like seven to one seven to two however long it is right three sometimes
ya so it's like a good six hours you know just studying like crazy just intense back to back as well like you don't even have break in between say okay ten minutes break go off the only break that you probably get is like from one class to another you just go and run the toilet and come back and it's also within like five minutes
sometimes you your brain needs to process things and let it like sit for a minute with that knowledge and then move on to the next task so I think even that in itself that transition period between one subject to another right your brain needs to like tackle that quickly and it needs to adapt because it is a daily thing like you kind of force yourself to um
ya you just kind of force yourself to have to you know work a certain way according to the system and I think I feel I personally feel this is just my own sort of opinion but like I think that the system doesn't work for you instead you worked for the system
ya because at the end of the day singapore's resources are the people and without the people we are actually nothing ya we are very very well placed on the map because the west can't cross to the east without passing through singapore and that's why our port of harbour is very
it's very well known and also it very efficient because we know if we invest in that heavily heavily invest in that and like make sure it's like top in the world right then a lot of people would come by and make business come by and trade come by and like
ya just import their goods and all that because we are reliable in that way it's all geopolitics lah so that is for another day
you see that's another thing right I wanna talk about cause like eh you know in education they are so they are so boxed up with just like oh english maths science right chinese whatever mother tongue oh and like
oh and then social studies combined humanities but they never really like ya we got history we got geography but they never really tackle on like the political aspect of it because I think at the end of the day day how systems are made right and how the society works is through the system and the system the way is being done is
the political aspect of it and I think we don't understand as we are growing up we just don't really know our human rights we don't really know like oh like what what we can do can we sat can we give feedback to the grassroot organisation you know then you will go to the government that kind of thing or can we not do we just abide to the rules you know there's no sort of like clear
ground saying that like eh you know you you have that freedom of speech you can say whatever you want if you feel like say the system not doing for you you can speak up but I think the matter of fact is that like singapore don't have that openness if you will they are not open to the ideas of the people I feel like the system here works
um only because the people are kinda like pushing it and not the other way round
ya because you're going through right now right even not even going through right you're on the way there I've already done it and ya it's true that like I do feel pressured because like when I was sixteen I didn't really know what I wanted to do
and I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to go to junior college for obviously with my score and all that like I did try and appeal for no I think I appealed for one of the schools I think it was novena eh novena innova innova and obviously didn't get in that's why I went to poly but like
ya I think that's one of the reasons why I strongly strongly just wanted to I was very adamant on just going to rather than err poly because I didn't know what I want to do so when I you know when I had no choice but to go into poly then obviously I kinda you know I didn't really had any dreams of being anything for a start right so I just kinda went into ah mama's business
because that was the only thing that I've kind of like I've been exposed to and I was quite okay with it and obviously pursued architecture degree so ya but I now even now I'm just thinking like do I actually want to do that in life cause I feel like I kind of sort of shift my priorities and
what I actually am interested in doing cause I am like I know that I am very in tune with like just wanting to help people in general like I think I thrive when people when I when I help them when I help people it in any way possible and I think I just need to find my sort calling I don't even know exactly where
or what I wanna do but it's definitely something to do with people but then again you know I've kinda narrow it down to like teaching because all these years I've been teaching um teaching kids and then obviously teaching asylum seekers and refugees after that it just kind of went on from there and like I really really like that open up my political sphere because before that I was very deluded I was just like
ya just living my life you know I'm going to a new country going abroad to study and that's it you know and then don't really need to have any sort of experiences come home every summer and then you know you be back home by three years by the end of three years and then like you know you can get a job decent job decent pay because you already got degree but that's not the case at all even though you got like papers even though you've got
O level N level whatever right you are still stuck in that limbo where eh you know even if you get the job say not not that the one that you want but it's sort of like you are qualified for it then it's like but then you're not happy in it do you actually
ya do you actually want to do what you have already set your mind to do say six years ago because that was in poly what that's that was when you were seventeen you got in and like you thought ya okay I love I love drawing I love I love and that's what I'm gonna do and then realising that like that's not very not very long lived
ya I'm very inclined to
helping those that are in need ya I know there is different aspects of like or different look or different forms of how poverty can look like in first world countries even it's not just about third world countries like africa or like um india or
at any
any colonised um sort of land from the western world
because obviously their resources are being stripped from them and like all that's left is the people and the people are living in poverty because the resources are scarce mmhmm scares I don't know
ya because of what they did to their land in say if agriculture is their only source of income that way that like you can earn the money but because that is already being abused and violated and you cannot and it takes a long time for like the soil to grow and re-fertilise and everything before they can actually go back to normal
so it's not just that lah that's just one aspects of it that I'm talking about haiti here
uh I think near the america
yes
ya then there's also this um having that divide you know uh haiti versus the dominican republic
puerto rican
wow
ya lor so
oh also from that right because that's a third world country it's very obvious very tangible look of poverty you know say or like you know if tsunami keeps happening in their land or like flooding like in jakarta per se like in indonesia it's always flooding because you know high rise water levels are rising
and their ah ground basically their land sinking already because of global warming so ya even that in itself right has so much implications and like it's not just the third world leh even in singapore like we see we have our own sort of poverty line that we do not it's not obvious to us because
we may not be the one that suffering it we're not the one that is like in it but there are um there are little glimpses of it you know that we see say you know a lot of like the social services
that I know of like they help people who actually don't have enough money to go around um say like you know elderly people who need help and they don't have help because like their children just don't want to take care of them that's a that's a that's also poverty like you growing old but like
there's no sort of support from anyone especially your family members cause you expect we we expect to rely on them what at the end of the day right but they're not there and then like you know people just trying to survive in business I think singapore singapore businesses is just very overcrowded at the minute so like
ya so like it's just difficult to make business because everyone is so competitive like the food business itself is really into millions you know and like you just have to stand out and in order to stand out you have to do something different and then like you know if you're an entrepreneur like you'll be struggling to meet ends meet cause like
you know just thinking of ways to make sure that you sustain that business
and I think with singapore's cost of living is not cheap either it's not
like say you have a house it's already like one big asset and one big liability that you have to basically commit the rest of your life then that's that sets that and then after that what else are you gonna have I don't know gonna have
you have to sustain that job that you work for five days a week six days a week don't know depends on the industry that you're in and it's crazy cause like
cause like there's no work life balance in singapore like people are overworked here to death
it's not as bad as japan but you cannot really you cannot really compare apple to orange you know like japan has their very own sort of culture of just working and like really perfecting every like their niche sort of like profession whereas like singapore is like
you know we just work work work earn money money money because there's so many bills to pay so many outgoing and like lesser of like the income so you gotta keep working to earn that like I think we both suffer from that sort of like repercussions of just our parents working very very hard just to sustain our sort of lifestyle also
you know if they put I know it it is a very big struggle cause like money is very very very important in singapore if you got no money you no talk no money no talk easily like that that that's why where the the sentence come about like the phrase come about cause like you really you really get very stressed out when you have no money here in singapore cause you cannot live without money ya like like the importance of money is so real cause like
and like that costs money I think it's just that sort of like living in a bit of like a fear as well because the government has already set that has already put that in place in you and a lot of it links money and I think it's just very
it it gets to a point where it's not healthy anymore yes it does it's very effective in stopping people from doing you know things like illegal or like things that you know you're not supposed to do and all that but like I'm sure there's other ways of policing I think there is something there needs to be some sort of balance in
ya there needs to be some sort of balance in just like money and people
I think weighs more than people at the minute cause like
and all that but like the truth of the matter is the people are not happy
yes they are only happy because they got the money but other than that are they truly happy living here
yes you got like amenities here you built billions and like millions and millions of dollars and you built the marina bay sands you built all the hotels tourism you know gardens by the bay everything but is that truly for like the locals or is it just to boost tourism because you need the money ya we do get the money back in terms of like you know we
like because we pay taxes and all that we do get to enjoy them because we get to you know visit these places without having to pay cause we singaporeans or but at the same time like I think that act of balancing between work and life is just not there at all
and I think that's why we get very overload and get stressed out and like nothing fills in our mind but just work because with no work we will die we cannot survive
ya I mean in sec one sec two already have like ten subjects or something like that lah even more right cause art music and like D&T F&N are all included in right you doing literally everything trying to juggle from four subjects in primary school say music and art but they're not really counted there
but like when you come to secondary school everything is suddenly like oh it's graded and it's like shit how like that big I think it's just a very big transitioning from primary school to secondary school because like number one there's already a streaming sort of thing and I know there's sort of a one two three but it's not as prevalent and it's not so like
it's not so like you know it's being set for your path you know like oh say like in primary school you don't have like oh you you have to spend extra year to just complete like say right but like in secondary school obviously there is that case cause like we got the express normal acad and normal tech stream and sometimes special screaming in like better schools
so ya it's just that disparity where like you being classed into
ya
I feel like it's just dirty
every once in awhile is not clean
whatever but you bring yours everywhere you drag it out to the living room to the seat and then uh
I'm tired
stop yawning
wow okay we're like three quarters of the way in we got less than fifteen minutes now which is good
ya I think it it helps to reflect on the society at large and might as an individual on how you can play a part to be better
even though you're just like a small speck of dust what you you can make that difference
I had no part in that I'm sorry that one is on you
kaypoh boy kaypoh
mm
I don't know how to interact with the bird I'm scared
he has a tongue duh is it long is it snakey
so what they have like very big taste bud I mean like the buds ah cause giraffe tongue is like very
then you give him your old phone case
because your your purple one has some sort of like three dimension thickness to it what and it's very bright so I think that catches his eye and it's like something bulging out hydraulic black
ya but he doesn't know anything
that's enough for pets I think pets are nice to have but they are very they need maintenance and if you cannot and need commitment and if you cannot do any of that you shouldn't have pet
I bond with gingy though
how do you know you haven't even met her
eat each other
mm
well it's like tom and jerry
ya but like the concept is still very similar it's like prey and predator
so ya
oh speaking of that right uh there's this tweet saying that uh what ah
uh the tom and jerry just think about it right the only reason why tom no why jerry is always after tom and try and like just uh what do you call it ah
try to like capture his attention is because maybe he doesn't want to let him eat other mices or it could be that
eh doesn't make sense oh is that or or because jerry cause jerry is it needs to pretend that he is chasing after a mice in the house because the owner is quite like
I I I you're here for a reason you know you're a cat you gotta go and chase the mice cause that's what cats do right so for him to maintain that sort of status he jerry becomes like his ally essentially
no they're not friends if not they wouldn't it be so tiring to keep constantly having you are like track each other
ya maybe I don't know
but ya just food for thought I think that was a very interesting way of seeing it you never know if this actually what the creators wants you to think
I feel like cartoons in general are quite intriguing they are actually very deep as it is so ironic cause like they look so simple and they look so far away from reality right
but the truth of the matter is like every underlying you know say episode of that cartoon like family guy like the simpsons like um south park
like all of them cartoon spongebob squarepants there's so many like symbolism and like underlying meaning to the certain things that they put out for animation
no
you got a minute to explain yourself again
ya but there's still a lot of meaning behind the things that they do or like
a lot of symbolism so so you can't really
you just don't see it it's more okay it's more prevalent in say simpsons or family guy cause they are direct you know in terms of like speaking about world problems or like
you know real life character like justin bieber donald trump they are all in the simpsons
or like family guy speaking about like politics you know there is but ya
I think that's another good topic to speak about for another day
it's nice
as a permanent thing
everyday we're doing it

okay
mm
okay anyway
ah
minimalistic
minimalist
mm minimalistic
ah
ah
a'ah
okay you
ah
master bedroom
mm
orh
then
who know how to paint
hmm
frame
then
that separates the living room and the and the bedrooms
remember ah I want to make that wall I want to
what's that
they have the drawer
I want to tear that down
so that it's a wall flat wall
okay from bottom from top to bottom is a flat wall
of anything ah
ya
yes yes correct it's like a frame wall
because it's a
it's a walkway what
huh
mm
but I think
I think no need raised floor lah
then does it really have a purpose
then
quite isolated from the rest of the room tau to mingle
because the the house is big the hall is big
a'ah
and then the one behind behind the entrance
so if people sit there then you cannot mingle with the people there already
because it's across but then it's quite far
you understand or not
a'ah
ah a'ah a'ah
ah but we make it minimalistic ah
ah
mm
then I thought
I thought of having the minimalistic dining table like just a normal because the floor is marble what
so maybe matching ah
mm
mm
which bedroom the small one
mm
master mm
the second one is the second one smack you okay then
can
can
okay wait wait wait wait wait the first bedroom
then
you don't want to buy playstation meh

the raised floor is about knee length
okay
mm
okay
ah
mmhmm
ah
L
okay
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm

because of the weight of the
of the swing itself and

because okay last time people use console because they got speakers got player now don't have already what all you sync to your phone want Netflix everything installed inside that's why you buy that kind of right everything is installed inside right so

no the mount is just a hook whereby you screw into the wall
ya
then
ya ya correct
so actually by right right
we cannot move the
because there's only one wall
beside the gate
ya lah where you want to move it because
the main wall is right now the the main wall is beside the gate right and then and then after that uh beside that wall is already the window
so
you can't really move it anywhere
okay
mmhmm

then on the way back err I I don't know why we were talking about random stuff
then I was talking about
oh down to V E
you know
ya cause I think we were
like emotional relationship issues that someone
call in and like kind of thing
ya that's what I'm what
no I'm pretty sure you know is trust some of them are just pure fan fiction
if I were the I will get a kick out I think the most stupid things ah
so it's one of those like
standard cheating thing
then I'll
sorry I just thought of of of him
ah then we were I was talking about it till like
ya ya then I was talking about it too
how to
tired ah
then he was
eighty nine
I wonder if you still ever uses that email address
ya
really
ah us ya
so um then he was saying how um
how did they go into it I
then we were talking about you
for some reason
then I was saying how you know it's awkward and all that
then he was saying how
err
kan
I would
I wouldn't support all these things
ya
so I was I was saying that I don't think hilmi actually supports ah no of course not
the act of
still hanging out with the guy
and everything like that and you hang out with the guys
release stress
ya end up the guys the guys they steal the show it shows kind of like support
in that sense
then he was saying how
it
he felt that it wasn't
a
something to
that you should do lah
or like it's
it's
like it's normally a bit
fucked up ah
then he was saying how um
I think he was talking to you about it
once or twice
before
this
like if you ever had that kind of conversation with with him about that ah
so now what now is just
huh huh
it's
it doesn't feel
great ah
I was telling him ah like they are gonna
ah when
when I had that relationship
issues back at the time right
then I was saying him eh I but mine wasn't cause of cheating ah of course
so
like if I was the cheater
in that sense
then he had he had he had a pause for like a bit tau
ya
like normal
angry guy
shadow boy a new guy
eh
sad sad you know you know until now he's been driving for like how long has been he he's been he's been driving for

hey brother
you should remind me to bring an cable then I can you know play play play some tunes then he was like
it it
singapore is very small
oh wow

so anyways right
ya so um about that I think then he was
telling me that
but
I don't want to have the girl there like I cannot
fair enough ah
right that's the whole to the other thing like it's not like you know beforehand
like you know you know you you don't know who's in attendance were
that's a bit of a stretch ah
to be fair
exactly right
okay there are some exceptions you know
okay but how do you okay how do you defend like from a moral standpoint like how do you make that argument that
like how do you defend
ah his his actions from a moral standpoint ah
okay you are much closer to the whole situation than I am lah kan
uh being with the wife on our ex
and the current girlfriend
well if you if you're with your with that guy patience is a given ah
mm
I don't know that's a very controversial statement ah
so by those dates
you you describe it as um
how you say recklessness
or like apathy
lack of ambition
to me that one it's more of
not yet it's it it's more from a position of privilege rather than gender lah like that's true
right
okay
fahim isn't exactly mister olympia material himself pe
I mean
what
I mean ya you know but
has ashley put on a lot of weight I I've always known her to be a bit of
on the err

ah ya your is twenty one point nine
orh without what is mine hold on
but the
but this one thing isn't accurate also cause the one doesn't ask for your gender which makes a difference ah
according to this my is twenty three point six
moderate risk
ya but I used to but I think um I think a couple of months ago I was
I was I was a bit of a
in a chonky
I think my my highest
my my my my peak ah
peak
no
my peak was I was nine
you know at my peak I was ninety kilos jer
right
I
I think I know which one you're talking about like the picture
sugar a is an addiction
huh huh huh
and then lunch and then breakfast and lunch is just blurs together so it's just like
mm
no no it's a roasted milk tea
ya
roasted
what
I don't know it's like probably toasted tea leaves or something not sure but there's a definite taste to it ah
ya
alright
in law no not yet so ah cause she
she's dating this
guy right
ya
and then
vacuum guy ya
ah german guy did I did I told you what he does for a living
like so he works for this german company of course ah and then what they do is they sell medical devices
so um it's like things to do if the if uh for you know respiratory things ah
so as you can imagine
they made a bomb doing uh this time ya
ya
so he was telling me that time ah he was telling me this I wouldn't say funny but kind of funny story
that's a bit siao also
ah quarterly report or something lah
company profits and all that
then one of his executives sent out a message ah
saying that you know
um good job let's hope we can keep this up
which is kind of fucked up
cause
ya
ya and then he was like celebrating it back via email quite cynical
company kind of like white email ah
then then at then a while ago were like complaining ah how can you say this kind of things
you know
what if he someone you know has you know
COVID
ya
ya like
you
ya you're doing work like you're earning money but you shouldn't you know
celebrate the fact that people are suffering
ya
I don't know german guy
ah then
he will he told me he told me that first ah that was like the first time I met him then when when I met him again he was telling me the same story that I thought okay ah this old man might might have been repeating his story again
but he say he just filtered that just to remind me about the initial story
and then he told me
then the guy like
the guy is on medical leave
for like a like a month or two ah
or a few months medical leave
then then I was like oh why
I wasn't thinking that
at at first I was thinking like something else lah right
then said no
he got COVID
what the fuck
is this real life it does actually happening that kind of thing
what you think of that
ya okay so anyway
um the initial thing was
they wanted to get married ah this year
but it's not is more of like my sister was pressured into asking him to get married this year
my parents lah of course
it's usually like a like a mother thing lah like
ya this kind of
ya so um and then what you call it ah then okay cause he has to do a lot of things right so the guy has to convert first
actually his name is dominic
then
do you do do you get to choose your your muslim name
or did they like
right
ya so anyway he has to do that uh he has to convert
and then he has
he had to like screw things up cause with his side of the family and all that right
islam ah
in general
like
which you know
can I can totally
ya if you talk to me about it woo you can go on for like this ah but my sister wasn't too happy then she was asking me about it lah then I'm like
yes
then I'm like
ya that's what I told my sister also lah I haven't actually talk to him myself ya it's not like you you don't have to give to then I I told my dad I told my sister you know
I never give I just donate
on my own
what I didn't mention was I donate to myself so it's a different thing
eh you know it's you know
it's up to you to determine who's needy what
in a way ya and you know self self-care is my is my priority now ya self-care is a priority now
so anyway I
so
ya so anyway then um
blah blah blah and all that then he was saying about it's not fair for his ends cause his family isn't around cause they cannot travel
cause
wuhan flu and all that
ah chinese cough as they say
and then err
ya so now they
ya so
there was like a bit of a fight
and then they kind of compromise in the sense where okay he will still go to the
conversion classes and um
and they will
try to take it a little bit slow ah from from from there cause they say they're okay he kind of needs he wants his family involved ah which is fair
ya lah of course lah you know you get married then your parents not over there
okay ah mine is a different thing so
yes so it feels a bit messed up ah
then uh
so my mum
I thought I thought they were in a good spot
ah and they were kind of
having some progress ah but at a good pace
then my mum's feeling anxious again
cause uh kan they both work from home
like
uh my sister and him
ya
so
my sister cannot go I think she can but she chooses not to go into
the office
ya I wish I could do that
um
ya then ah he goes over to his place a lot cause uh K so my my parents live in bedok south right which is
basically near tanah merah right
then he lives at the condo at tanah merah
ya I think that's what it's called ya I've been there before once pe
ya
so she goes over there like every other day ah to like you know to do her work and stuff which to me makes a lot of fucking sense cause you know
your the house is crowded
you got to deal with that
with two teenage boys
and there's no air con
ah okay three teenage boys
ya and there's no
ya sia ya what the fuck
no is like he feels like he was born a teenager and that's it lah
one of those guys
ya
and then ah she's there like every other day then um that day I kind of went to meet my mum
ya then of course after the whole initial
five ten minutes of eh why you pierce your ear blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
kind of thing
ya
then after that she was complaining about uh that issue like my sister
um being over there lah what
and saying how oh
my mum
then
ya then and all that then she was asking me what do you think she should do ah
I don't know then I I told her that I think the best thing to do is
so the best thing to do
ya lah exactly then I told her like you haven't talked to his side also
ya
the guy's side
ya ya
ya then
right
I think they should know
then the last time ah he talked to me and uh he brought me out for beers
ah I've got things to do ah
ya so I didn't
what
an online class that that I want to do
ya
no no no no as in I am I am I am doing like a psychology course lah so
no it's one of those like fucking cheap cheap cheap ones lah it's just to like you know
ah ya
so anyway um what what I saying ya then he was telling me about
ah at first if his parents have some reservations ah about him
going out with a malay asian girl ah
you know how the whole stereotype is like right
not only but it's more like white guy then coming to to east asia where they're getting taken advantage of
I get it
fair enough
no ah ah whoa this just whoa whoa that's fucked up
that's true
then at first I was kind of offended and then I had then I really thought about it for like for like a bit then I realised okay
after certain incidents
that had that happen in germany and the whole influx of like foreigners right
ya and some of them are from like ah muslim countries lah right
turkey and all that
then felicia was like okay then it makes sense for them not to have not a very
positive views on like muslims in general
but I don't know how to like explain it to my mum
in that way tau
was it mm
ya so I think in the end just closed like that you know I think there's compromise already
to try to talk talk my sister into
maybe getting an engagement first lah

okay so I'm natasha and
whoa
the part ya ya ya before we hit the seven mark
yes you break the contract then bye bye
there goes the documentary that we've been planning
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
my most memorable meal
I don't have
oh
sometimes I still think about the bunny chow
right
ya I know like legit
so ya we had the bunny chow in
south africa cape town
and it is just
and that was great
why was it great ah I it was butter chicken it wasn't curry
oh
mm
poof
ya
is memorable right I think it's like the
ya and the area we were at was like
and I think it was also cause like maybe we were hungry
so that explains why
when when we are hungry everything tastes great and
uh huh
a'ah
a'ah
oh ya the customer ya
err I did we eat at another place after that I was I'm pretty sure
ya
I try to remember
ya
the burger right
perbezaan dia memang
what did you order from McDonald's I can't remember
yet
that was still much better no I think
cause we were given only ah ketchup packet at the particular McDonald's and clearly cause number one
malay number two
prefers spicy stuff
everything they had was like just not
not good enough okay
ya no McSpicy no nothing so of course we'll be like okay fine we try the local McDonald's but
ya so I took out the chili packet
next to the tomato ketchup packet then I'm pretty sure they were like someone was like where did this chili packet come from
just another day
I feel like we finish the chili packet on that one day right
everything we wanted we wanted chili chili
I think like we ate too much but
oh
mmhmm
it was basically
right
ya we ate samosa
kan
kan something like that
I think I I remember I took a photo
we went there twenty seventeen
three years
so I think there was
it was the thing
ya
ya
and cause of the slavery and all that and colonialism so a very different malay food lah
mmhmm
remember then we went to the shady okay not shady I'm so sorry but like the well-to-do neighbourhood and then we drove next to the train
then after you were like nata got train then I want to look but I'm driving
and then got the people waving from the train and then you were like nata look at there but I was driving
no it's not is it a pani
and then and then they tell us you wanna you want to half or you want the full and then I think then we so stupid we said full
loaded
ya there was fries there was um meat there was what cheese
of the full and then we were like ya one one uh beef one chicken so we got the full two full of the loaves right
and then we brought back and then we ate
and then we couldn't even finish
and then we
we ate like we continue
ya we can keep for the next day but we have no microwave
and and it was winter
you remember
a'ah
not
a'ah
ya
so we had
so like I think for lunch and dinner tau we ate lunch and dinner we ate that one
half
of course we won't we we spend much money on that
the next day for breakfast
kan
and then
ya and then like for someone like you also who can eat a lot also even that was like too much don't want to eat
ya cause the even the half right the half of that
I remember like I remember like why why this food came about was cause the food was for slaves back then right
ya then like it's just the one meal for that one day
like mm
cape town and they also oh it's called the gatsby
right gatsby ya so ya then the person also eat the gatsby
ya
but then I think like oh my gosh
think that was memorable in a fact that we couldn't finish
to be fair they tried to warn us
err speaking of anything stupid
that trip
yes
ya I don't know it's like there there's stupid thing was one of the things
ah we wanted to climb a hill it was called signal hill something like that so we took a Grab there
ya I remember we were quite sleepy ya and then
um the spot but it also seems like the spot cause it it just like the it's just the entrance of a
ah
and then it was almost at the top like I think like ten minutes before we reach the top that we realised that we were not climbing a hill but the actual mountain
and it was like
we should have seen this coming but also why was that man jogging
is it like same concept as bukit timah hill
ya and
it was quite high like
ah in fact yup it was challenging
and
there was ladders there was ropes and you had to climb the rocks like a big rock
and I remember thinking while we were there I like I kept asking you right like are we sure this is the hill and then we were like eh
maybe their hills are like this
and then we reach like almost ten minute maybe five ten minutes before we reach the top
then we realised we can actually use our phones
so we googled
we I think no I think I look at Google map like where the heck are we and then Google map showed that we were on lion's head mountain and then we were like what and then we googled lion's head mountain and then we reached and then by the time we reached the peak already and then we saw the sign lion's head mountain peak six hundred is it metres six hundred or something metres above water
ya
ya
and
ya
surreal
ya
ya I remembered that
that so stupid
so we entered the wrong entrance lah basically the the Grab driver confident thought we wanted to climb the freaking mountain
and I also think
hiking stick
I think they were tourists also
ya and they were clearly ready they had water bottle
ya no the first thing we did was get a Grab go back to go back to our place drink water
ya
what a morning
what time did we leave we leave the house I think six or five five or six
and think we went back like eleven right
ya we we rested for like one two hours I think so
the city
we we climb the mountain
okay to be fair our view was very good also
ya okay
ah that that's the plan ah that's the plan ten years down the road
so
two zero two seven
return to cape town
we we find a life there right
before we die when we finally get employed
hais
you told her
okay but to be fair I told you you can have done your own things
what
cause of my mum right she wanted to donate all the mosques
eh but to be fair right we hit we hit up all the mosques
like it was quite surprising that there was
ya and then like cause it's also like
like basically we were just exploring the city lah cause we hit one end to the other end to the other end
it was all walking distance right
uh huh
uh huh
ya even though it was basically just to deposit money
I know we did like
we we bail out
ah what else
okay how about we start with food
we we went there for the exchange and the exchange for like a few weeks right ya
um south africa
and then the field trip the accommodations my god
ah the my god is a very good my god not like a bad
I mean to be fair they took all our money also
I mean safari we imagine I'm assuming people will imagine like flat lands and lions which we did
ya
so in terms of the safari let's see what what food I just want to think about the food
oh ya I think cause we were at the coast
ah yes the ostrich
we were at a ostrich farm
ya
so the meat that we ate were the ostriches we saw that day in the afternoon then we ate their brother
ya
no particularly memorable food per say
ah ah ah
you know cause these americans
just just saying
ya and
ish
they not mature yet
ya so like
ya a few and other from right with a few other singaporeans and then
the
ya
woohoo that kind of thing but then we went in like meh we just make new friends I guess in this new
van
a'ah
avoid
ya and not only that we sacrifice one another like sacrifice ourselves
to
ya
ya ya
I think he enjoy it lah
ya I mean got to be fair
he is a bit questionable but whatever
yes
with him never mind don't need
we had fun
ya he's like natasha where's my photos
ya the food wasn't much to say but ya the people
kayaking in the river right
ya I that one I don't think I will forget cause I had to partner with the guy
and then everybody didn't want to paddle next to our boat so everybody just went ahead of us
a'ah
yes
yes I remember
I remember scolding him
okay what else did we do kayak
the reserve
oh my god
the cave
I was just talking about this to my friend tau
you know the other day like it's one of the few things that I will remember for life getting stuck in a cave
hais
I mean to be fair I warn everybody I was like telling them I feel like I will confirm get stuck cause I have no eye-hand coordination
let alone with my legs I no coordination whatsoever so I will I think I will get stuck in the hole
everybody laugh it off
and then what happened
I got stuck in the freaking hole
ya and then at then during dinner I still remember someone like do you that someone was stuck in a cave and then I was over there ya that was me
then she automatically oh really I'm so sorry
ah okay hmm
a cave
mm
the highlight reel
you know hunger games then got the cannon boom
eh
do you want to see another prompt
err if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
oh
oh
ya I mean
it's still considered art
sure
okay
one skill
um
one new skill
hmm
ah I know I want to learn how to ice skate
for no reason whatsoever but just to have fun
I asked
ice
cause kaysa does ice skating
apparently her whole family does
okay anyway ya but like she said I think she said like inline skating is kind of
but I'm still assuming it's a new skill
so ya I mean that will be very fun
ice skate at and then amy amy follow but then amy almost died
so ya I was like ya if I live somewhere
where there's a lake
I would definitely learn and there's winter I would definitely learn how to
ice skate for fun
that be fun
two more skills
ya
oh okay
you'll be like is it dinner time
like water activities
don't have like oh

no no but err okay lah that time I order also he he got my order quite well so okay lah
it's funny how like this is one of our first few time seeing a male
shopkeeper
I I prefer it that way seriously because ya cause if not it's causing inconvenience to other people
no like you eating people starring is fine but if you were to eat and laugh and like jer take your own damn sweet time yes you deserve to be skewered
I think that time the first few times that we went was when we were in school and it was no no it was after lunch hour
okay either way is before or after lunch hour it's not during lunch hour so you can still eat and talk ya
I think we we bought from there before
mm mm mm mm mm

mm mm mm mm
ah yes lah
no you that's the thing you know when it comes to this kind of health issue kan sometimes you can be really healthy and all that but it will still happen to you
all this while
so that's the thing ah like he's always been like exercising if he's not running he'll be cycling you know that kind of thing
first thirty years of his life
oh ya ya forgot
actually I don't know because I only know them I only know him from twenty six years and above
but you never know I very I very scared like I'm always get go home girl checks is like
no lah you just tell it for yourself or for your family lah the I think that's about it
mm
mm mm
ya
mm
mm
it was really tricky ah ya I would suggest him like go go and meet a dietitian or something so that they can look at meal plans
mm mm mm mm
damn
mm gym-ing I don't know
maybe that's how they see it as a form of motivation ah
mm
mm mm mm
mm
is it
I don't reply
oh
okay okay got it
ya I got it I got it
I mean I don't know whether it's just downright creepy or is it just like very sweet like aww you keep track of my life thanks
that's true lah that's true lah
you can go shop and see what's there for cyber monday
no lah as in like just see lah like oh you guys have any like special promotion for cyber monday

I you need to refresh my memory
how much is it
no you want to buy three
but okay lah I mean have you been buying clothes recently
oh okay okay then you need to rethink I buy my clothes every six months
serious
ya I know but it's like okay for me is when I buy I will buy like
ya lah I think design sizes it's it's all together mah like you will see something that's in your size by it's not what you want and it's you know you want this particular design but the size is not available so technically you'd mm just see which one is um
I know right ya
need to rethink my life decisions you know now that I'm going to be thirty one soon
no lah as in you'll still buy but not as often as before
exactly ya so it's really choosing your battles lah
mm mm
mm mm mm of course ya ya ya
mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
ya so nobody knows like if you wear this top I don't even know I didn't even remember that you bought it at H&M at melaka oh it's a very comfortable sweater
ya ya I mean if you want I mean I mean it'll be better if we actually left earlier just now lah so you get you get what you are looking for
ya so basically ya if it didn't work if it doesn't work out today you can always bring him tomorrow lah
I don't know because if it's been there and no one claimed it they will also want to remove it in case orh other people want to use the slot and all that
mm ya
very smart boy
mm I mean you can always check back with the doctor lah like is it normal to feel this way
mm mm mm
ah okay okay
oh okay
mm mm mm mm
mm mm
it was at bedok eh not like punggol or something
yay
mm okay okay
okay lah I'm actually quite excited lah looking forward to it cause I don't know what to expect and the I think it's quite been it's been quite a long time since I last had steak
ya I think the last time we had steak was um last year at Elfuego
ya
in december
okay ah
I mean if lah I say and the view itself quite nice mah
okay
mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
it's the middle of nowhere sia
but I didn't know EXPO is a view
ee

I mean you can see lah from the pictures but you don't have to book
mm mm mm
oh serious ah okay
mm mm mm mm
oh okay okay
so they have an office there lah actually
ya it's true
sure lor
mm
mm mm mm mm understand understand
but there are some states just living in denial
mm
ah natural selection
mm
mmhmm
ah
no no no jail
why would you wanna jail them
you cannot jail people immediately just for that one incident what
ah
you think these people got no money meh to pay
mm
mm mm
screen divider for every table and then when you're at your table you must wear mask at all times
so they have certain measures lah
ya except when I eat lah
orh
ya so there's there's rules and regulation lah it's not like they just say okay maximum fifty do whatever you want no you still have certain things that you have to follow
mm
ya must wear in case like people from the other um you know rooms come in to talk to you and all that and then you don't have your mask on it's really to reduce the chances of you ah getting that lah
mm
but the mask is the cause of breakouts
it's like I have really dry skin on my chin I'm so annoyed oh my god
the below the eyes cannot make it lah ah
okay I don't mind going there
of course of course of course
no I'll be like yes this is the time for me to show my skills of climbing away from responsibility
uh
then I will avoid like now you see me now you can't
arrow at work okay lah it's still it's part of my job but arrow other things in life and I'm actually quite good at it I'm good at manoeuvring my way out of this situations
thanks thanks
I mean like I can arrow out of so many situation until people go back to the person they broke up with
it's it's the same skill
aha
ah same man
aww
ah
mm mm
ya accept me for who I am
ugh
I'm just saying it works both ways
mm
ya
no they don't talk lah during the game
no I'm talking about different types of people I was talking about my previous clan
ah so they know how to
ya ya ya ya ah ah
ya
ah
then like and then I'll be like
adela I
ah
it's really a big country problem you know like for us it's just so easy
they also experience bad reception leh and then they keep changing because for them is they don't use line they use top up so they can change telco every now and then kan
ya
video
mashallah
cause I need to know how long is the road trip going to be if it's gonna be like for eight hours long obviously I'm not gonna game because I need my phone to be alive
mm mm
oi
oh really when
all the best girl
okay
oh my god girl have fun with the pap smear man it hurts like a bitch
oh my god it was painful I was like just
oh my god
ah
feel so hurt
eh but it really hurts ah it really hurts and the doctor
it's everyone what but the good side of it is is once every five years
okay you do it now five years later then you think about it
not fist lah
what do you mean by lube
oh lube L U B E no no no no it's not it's not about lube
then to open need it is ya so the open part is the one that's painful that one they will always use it
do you just like
no no it's once every five years so it's really good like I've checked then they said mine is negative so okay lah
ya
it depends lah like I have high tolerance for pain and I actually like
ya ya correct
mm mm
ya so no worry lah I think should be okay
ya even my mum did pap smear
no actually pap smear that time cause wanted to check err about her the ovaries her uterus
then I was like
and then the lady just the reception's like madam fadilah I was like miss
ya single mum or what the husband is just not caring enough to accompany her and all that
mm mm mm
ya
mm and she's really young I mean I was sitting beside
and but I had my ears plugged but
ah Spotify off
and
ya and but the the girl was crying and the mum said it's okay we wait for what happens after this and then we'll figure out what we'll do after that okay
ya
so like then I didn't say lah I just keep quiet cause I I'm supposed to be listening to music remember
ya
but ya it was like interesting ah
mm
mm mm
ya you very common
damn girl
damn damn
eh eh
mm
seventeen
mm mm
I I no okay lah I I think that point of time I was like I need to get the top five in class you know that kind of thing like
ya oh my god
but I feel like for them like sexual education had to start like really early you know
then throw outside lah
not strong ah
it won't it's like quite tight so
like if you're not ready to have a child then do something about it like make sure you don't conceive
ya
ya so I think a safe bet would be like after you done that surgical procedure right maybe you wait like a month first and then after that you or maybe after menstrual cycle
mm mm
ya
orh okay
I mean it's good lah then she has options you know that kind of thing
catch ball mah that's why
oh my god

you are blocking them you know
then the way you shout is obvious that you saw one thing
no
uh
ah ah
oh
hello
mm
okay the master bedroom toilet okay
ah
correct correct
ah
hey
okay why is it right your first instinct is to turn to it not to not
turn away from it
I saw you first
train
wah until now
until time ah

oh
whoa
wah so weird leh
anabelle
oh shit
that one dig out the eyes
mm
ah
ah ah ah
uh huh

whoa
wah
short eh
scare yourself first
ya
exactly but how they are the one doing the task tau which are brushing the teeth and washing the dishes
don't
and then have you heard any in okay let's not touch our own club because like we don't want to scare ourself like that
no
don't know
okay in our club obviously there is lah but like I just choose to ignore it
because like I'm gonna work there for very long time you know like witch we work together
but you've never seen
ya
ya
like you what me you what you want me to do like
but hundred bro
bro hundred is fucking real bro
the thing will take dumbbell and smash on the floor
yes
yes
so closing shift ya so she's doing all that
because she's taking too long to get out from the club
whenever then do you know how hundred is last time right tower counter and then you have to go down the stairs
that is like I think like
seven six flight of stairs
time
mm mm all the way down
ya so like the the part where
uh
ya like
ten O two

so the thing is
okay another story is it's a shopping mall

they will have a nap
so lasiri was sleeping
there is a scientific reason for all that what
then
when I say cannot ah will say no bro
sitting on top of me damn big
so so she's a trainer what so she went to this one guy
hey bro
how you know
how that thing looks like what happened to her because it happened to him as well
so like to me right
if you tell me alone I will say you world but because
there is a cross referencing
the two person experiencing the same thing then I feel like eh maybe real siot
kan
yes and it's fucking big so that fucking big thing is the same thing that
snatches the the weight at night
that gets angry
uh ya same

oh
but do you know the swensen soup in the bread if they put sourdough then I'm like shit
uh uh
the bread is the sourdough
uh it is it's just a very wheat bread to me
uh uh
uh pizza hut they have one day this meal they call it
curry zazzle
I don't like it also but then that is the only thing that is spicy
so like I have to eat spicy food right
and always because when I go out right I feel very very very hungry I can't even wait for the baked rice to cool down I will end up burning my tongue
wah means you reach work swee swee sia
I no time to this one know
cannot no time I know lah every time go work
from here I know
ya it is near you know right from my house when you walk when you want to walk to the that's really like if you walk relax seven minutes if you walk like me
four minute
then I usually wait for the train like one or two minute
then it takes another eight minutes to raffles place from raffles place to our workplace ah that one is the problem
outside where then jaywalk
oh then you can walk
you quite smart hor
I've never thought of that leh
wow
shit
okay

a'ah
a'ah
um
um ya
ya uh um ya so
ya
wait wait wait
err
ya so they will say I wil tell you the number one nine seven two ah fifteen minutes later I I fill the number and tell me again then writing again right ya
ya you know that you are actually
ya do you know that actually are you are supposed to
so it was at the mild stage right you should
gotten it diagnosed then because if you get got it diagnosed then then doctor can frequently follow up but they cannot just do ah the
err what actually dementia you can see from their brain that it is um they having dementia lah but because stroke also can cause you to have some deformities in the brain say dementia is still like a mental condition right they have to do all test there like depression schizophrenia all these they still do test
like verbal assessments you know but
the project
you know they don't
you better but there's no need to stop
we
know
so people
that version
you can got you involved
if means that you need to do
want to
we we talk
we
um
kid
ya I know
you know
mm
I
ya but
you are already tired from work then you go home your parents not to say burden but you have to give hundred percent dedication
um
oh
but sometimes
ya so like if there is something like that I think it's very attractive lah because some is an enclosed space so you can come and visit your
you wanna have a village like that it has to be somewhere that is already developed that still needs more developing like nursing um
ah
ya
the mmhmm
there are because like if they know then some people might take advantage of it
ya
ya
ya
I think
but if you have um your rental flat that is above it right that studio apartment that is above you have two hundred to four hundred unit eh two hundred unit so two hundred units
but because her dad like everybody has err I mean maybe not just singapore everybody
temple is a hindu temple
you know but how about the buddhist how about the carton how about the christians how about any
ya lah
mm ya
I think
mm ya mm
mm
mm
I'm not
that kind of thing then um then like then
a'ah
ya so like or don't no and then I feel maybe
mm
oo
I think there are a few points that be
take away from here is the number one
because
ah
mm
but
but it's just me like I because I don't like to travel so you are convenient lah that I'm already at my house like that
ya so
mm
mm
mmhmm
you think you have
um next ah what
I think
so far from what I learned about this are taking care of a being a secondary caregiver or living in the same household right
a'ah
what I think
ya like
that's the main thing that's the main thing ya like you have to always be prepared like because the thing is for progressive condition right
then you move on on on you
so you like you're drowning you
I try to swim okay let me ah see how I if I can go and get help it really is that they're getting help
ah swimming is trying to move forward right is really paying like you really can't and sometimes when you want
mm
it's like um
you know why I believe that it is not working I would like to close the case I would like to go somewhere else then you you have to be let alright I will close the case and then
what for the um for the
professional sometimes if they feel like the case is not is not going smoothly it's not working out they can actually feedback to their supervisor and be like I'm sorry but I think this case any if not working out you know
you already have that bond and the attachment
and for professionals that is that boundary
ya
mm
mm mm
ya
ya you guys are doing experimenting on your own you know like that's what doctors want it's because doctors are not there twenty four seven
sometimes doctors are also like unhappy lah like you want you keep the medication here medication there but it's just that dementia is so different that dementia is not
ah
mm
mm so we know lah that communication is like the key to
mm
mm
mm
mm
phenomenon
oh okay lah
okay

stalisha
my day today is very tiring obviously um it's been two days ah I sleep very late
um and so far it's been well um it went well
unexpectedly but it's still so tiring lah
um it's among the home-based sellers lah
ya it became a trend and everyone is like trying and I tried like two locals'
have their
ya and then I tried myself
so ya
actually I've been learning how to cook
when I like crave it
and at that time there were no orders
ah ah
customers ah
yes
delivery is
um by my partner he because he also did Deliveroo as a part time
and ya ah so every delivery charges I will just pay him straight lah hundred per cent goes to him
this is only the first
the first launch ya the first week of it
ya yesterday and today
um
I don't think it will sustain in a in the long run because
I have a lot of things to do
ah I have school I have um freelance job I have part time jobs I have a lot of things to juggle
ya
go ah because this is not like an official business this is just like
something that I like to do and share with other people
and maybe like some in the future the menu will change lah because I like to bake also
um brownies or cookies something like that
branding
tahbegs tahbegs
ya it's tahbegs is from tahu and begedil but we make it very hipster
so it's tahbegs
ya T H B E G S
oh ya um I also own a small business selling bawals
eh it's on hold right now because we literally have no idea what the next collection will be eh next collection will be
collection
ya
for now we only have two collections
um better than our recent one
so and the stocks is like stuck up there because I guess we didn't learn about our customers that well yet
ah because um me and my partner lah
ya we we
ya we like to okay the most common thing about both of us is we like to hustle
twenty one
that young
oh
ah
mm mm
mm mm
mmhmm
that's the best you can sleep
oh okay okay okay
you are staying still for two and a half hours
oh mm ah
mm mm
wow okay
uh uh
mm mm
I you like wrapped
oh okay okay okay
uh uh
uh uh
oh my god
they didn't pay you
oh ya ya ya
mm mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh I see
um
what am I doing at nineteen
um I work
part time
ya at Starbucks and I was also schooling
at that point and also doing my freelance model
I start since I was
seventeen years old
um
there was this
and then um I was very camera shy last time
so I'm like meh like I I don't even bother lah but then my partner saw like eh you should try lah you just try then orh
I said no I don't want err I'm not comfortable with other people taking photos of me because it's very awkward
then say just try one and then he post the um the the model entry
on Instagram
and
ya I did know
ah he applied to two ah company and I got accepted by two of them both of them
ah it was an unpaid job
for
um until I was maybe
um nineteen
so did
instead of paying me by money they pay me by
um
by their apparel
it's like so bad and then then like imagine like um the shooting place is like gardens by the bay then like the amount of time I need to travel there
err when it comes to nineteen years old something like somewhere there
tell me lah like oh you need to start
um charging these people because you are having a lot of um
and alhamdulillah it also went well
ah
so people always see me as like the those model influencer but I don't consider myself as an influencer I'm just helping business to
um sell their products ah
ya
influencer I feel like they just
take
uh and it didn't work ah
I lost two hundred and fifty dollars
because ah her charges was hundred fifty for one Instagram post
and fifty dollars
for one story
and it does it didn't
bring any sales lah so I was like okay um actually I would rate influencers is our customers
ya the most honest person and they can make sales and they um they really spread the word and tag you know
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
other companies ya
mmhmm
usually um before we post something right for the company we also like send the
what do they call it
okay lah the context ah the context of the post ah we
ya the description we always like um send it
ah on our post
uh it's our post because we are like um ya
usually is like that
ah no that that's the thing that's why I don't um I don't
consider myself an influencer because
I don't think I'm a good influence influence to young people
to be honest just that people a lot of people look up to me because I'm very hype
that's all
sorry
because like um they told me lah like they don't know how I juggle because I was a full time student and being a fashion designer
um is very difficult
um and it's very time consuming so
there's people like
they quit their part time because they really cannot juggle lah but for me I can at that point of time I can juggle two jobs my freelance and Starbucks
and like before school like I mean
imagine like school starts at twelve A twelve
so I work Starbucks from six opening to eleven
and then I go school and then after school um there's a photo shoot maybe that lesson um end at three or four
so the shoot starts at like six six P M until night lah something like that
ya it's like it's very bad lah is unhealthy also but ya a lot of people look up to me because if I want to work hard I really work
for it
I want to open up uh my own company ah
um
from my own manufacture from my own designs everything
alamak we didn't sign up for a third party
the company
mm
because all of this um of course I did research prior
and
I am thankful that my school also
teach marketing
and ya I got to apply a lot of you know what I learn from school put into business and
like one thing that I really see something wrong with my business is not knowing my customers well and at the same time at that point of time I was like learning this
um creative thinking creative thinking is where you
know your customers well lah and
uh uh
ya
yes the sustain is very difficult
and like
their customers like
it
hundred percent wrong in so many ways because we cannot just assume like that
ya and ya there's a lot of
that's one of the difficult things that I face lah when I'm opening this um Kamash
um
yes
and
out first what ah ah
ya and I thought no it's nice it's luxurious but
but my customers are young
so they want things very
eight colours already sold out
ya
ah we manufacture ourself
ah no uh we liaise with a factory in jakarta
yes
research
we need a lot of research yes
mm
no lah I mean like obviously uh when you grow up
eh
ah my god okay it needs to switch
naturally um
so firstly I really wanted to be a lawyer
cons about being a nurse
and then ah
some personal reasons lah for me but I feel like it's very selfish of her because her that personal reason I cannot become what I want to become
and also another thing I like to travel around the world
so I thought I want to be a
crew
those type of
incident
car crash eh plane crash ya
you cannot like foresee what
and
ya lah exactly then I was like okay sure
so ah basically ah
so I'm like okay lah since I cannot do anything else right I just learn fashion design and that's where I
grew to liking it
um ya
ya first you said you want to be doctor
right
ya I want to be
what doctor orh an acting
orh okay ah clown doctor
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
oh okay
uh
I can fix my own teeth
mm
mm
wow
ya
oh my god
so that's what
inspired you to become an actor
mmhmm
mm
mm I see
now last time I remember the first play that I went
eh the first ya your first show is it
ya the first show I've watched and it was I think that was the most

so fathul I have a question for you mm if you have three wishes what are err what three wishes would you want to have
well for me the first wish that would want to have is to have more wishes I think you would err void their rules of the wishes but that is the first wish that I would like to have provided there is no rules to the wishes with these more wishes that I can attain whatever I want in this world
and my second wish is to live happily to like you say um by giving others you feel happy I think there's a research that says whereby when one give to the poor or when one give what they have in out of sincerity they have a spark of happiness so maybe this can apply to me also
and to live happily means a lot of things hmm maybe to have a good family to have a good career to have a stable job and after all to live happily is what everyone wants lah
mm and some skills that I want to have err maybe include err having all the capabilities to all the knowledge that that exist in this world ah
so your three wishes were getting rich fit and what and intelligence right I think my my wishes actually encompass your wishes because to have to live happily err to us to some people to live happily is to have err the money and the wealth
err so and also when you are fit the goal of getting fit is also to feel good and to be happy ah and intelligence also ah this is to me I think it relates to me also ah because to have the intelligence is to have the skills and to acquire skills within a short period of time
uh so maybe for now we move uh to the next question which is err superpowers fathul what err if you have if you can have any superpowers only one one superpowers what would it be
ah eh
actually I disagree when you say teleportation could reduce the number of ah the number of COVID cases because if for example when people that have this virus they freely want to teleport away from the place maybe they don't know that they have this virus but then they just teleport so in this case
to the place that he teleported the people around him will be infected also and let let's say the people around him also have teleportation ability then it might come to a point whereby everyone in this world might be infected don't you agree
I see where you are coming from but I still hold the view whereby you err by accident
the the
the amount of err infection or the possibilities of uh infection rate ah you have anything to argue
yes correct
so if this regeneration ability I can do whatever I want all the high risk activity or all the high risk uh ambitions that I have
or maybe uh I I can take risks without having worrying that I might uh injured too much of my body because I know that I have this regeneration ability
so I can also maybe err get into fights knowing that I can fully regenerate myself and my opponent got no ability to do that so in that case I will definitely win ah
provided I am strong ah and maybe with this regeneration
hmm
I can donate let's say some parts of my uh limbs to those who need it so for example some people need a leg
hmm where I have this ability so I can do is err I request my leg to be cut off and then give away err in that case then my leg will regenerate itself like how the lizard uh tails it regenerates after some time of it losing the thing
mm what do you think about this regeneration ability
mm it's interesting twist
one day of my life in that case then I would maybe accept but then reduce the high risk activity that I want to indulge in
to
to shorten your lifespan is to asking for death to come nearer
and about this regeneration maybe well since it will reduce my life by one day like what you give me the twist
then I would maybe choose another ability maybe the ability that I would want is invincibility because with invincibility
what I think is I can go through
the customs or the immigrations or flight without having uh to be looked at or without err being detected was one of my dreams is to travel around the world
so if this ability of invincibility I can do whatever I want without anyone noticing where I've gone or where where I'm heading towards cause I have this
hmm I have this
I want to be uh isolated from everyone just to focus on myself focus on my being
and my my own self ah to be isolated from this world not being distracted by everyone around me cause personally
when when I when I'm around people at times I feel whereby their worries and problems uh affected me so with that sometimes I prefer to be alone
mm
how long maybe until I feel peace ah so is actually quite subjective so if if you were to ask me how long
I couldn't give a I I cannot give a number of years or months ah but maybe for a start maybe I will start by months ah then slowly maybe I will
err increase the number of the period ah slowly
hmm
we can never do something to improve the people around us
because for me months is actually not a long time is actually maybe compared to years years is definitely longer but if for months maybe is still bearable lah
but it has to be looked in a certain way ah whereby the person
err
he is not affecting badly uh around the people uh uh he don't affect the people around him badly so he have to live in a good state ah
uh
interesting question
in this case I think he shouldn't because he still have responsibility and if he were to leave
they will change a lot lah so if the father is not there to to be there with the child then the father will miss out on the child's development the child's small err goals small err
small achievement so this child will live without uh having a father figure and also the emotional
emotional of the emotion of the wife ah he shouldn't leave
that long unless the wife err agrees even with that I think he shouldn't fully isolate himself he should maybe still keep on in contact
with the person that he is responsible for but in in a case whereby the person has no responsibilities is not responsible for anything then I think he's free ah to do anything that he wants
do you think so
eh
uh cause bitcoin ten years ago it's it it's very cheap compared to now one bitcoin is maybe up to eleven thousand
ten years ago it's maybe just few few hundred maybe even below hundred and you K if for example you buy hundred bitcoin back then
you can be a millionaire now then it is what I would tell my ten year old self
err
if if I were to be able to go back in time and maybe that is in terms of monetary ah but in terms of my life I would just tell him to go through what is going through and maybe to study properly and chase your dreams ah
cause after all even ten years
ahead which is now I'm actually quite satisfied with what I've done
so I'm I will just tell him to just do what he is going to do and follow his heart ah
mm so what about you what will you tell your own self ten years ago
talking about the investment part when I said tell my ten-year-old self err I don't mean to start at ten years old what I meant was that maybe if I'm able to convince him then I would tell him okay two years along the road invest in this in this in this
you will get rich I think when I say you will get rich you will entice my ten-year-old self ah
then maybe if I if I have a impact on myself at ten years old then maybe it will bring benefit whereby I can reap what I sow today
mm and just now you were saying about
the second topic what was it
after investment
sorry
okay nowadays
um what is a time capsule
yes yes I think I've heard of this before and I think so I think is not limited to videos uh I think even people they put items which bring memories to them to bring forward to maybe the next ten years or
how many years down or even maybe even to the next generation few will sing about this time capsule what is it what is it about
if you can't remember it now and then maybe you should start back and that you have to wait ten years more to to get the video done
but it's a interesting concept where where you record yourself maybe I will start
start doing that myself and uh an option that you can do maybe is a suggestion is to save it in a cloud lah or maybe just email yourself ah so that you won't lose the video and the video will be online
it's interesting I think you can actually even see these types of video on the social media like youtube and all then there are people that that started this thing quite some time ago talking about this I I remember seeing
err a video whereby someone he takes a picture of himself uh since he was teenager all the way until he's married and all the way until he is err I think about early thirties
it's interesting to see err how that person progresses throughout his life so maybe this might entice you to maybe err start doing it
to because you are into this time capsule and things
mm
K
you maybe you next we should talk about um near death experience
whereby you almost lost your life but maybe due to some miracles or some
okay for me my near death experience that I remember maybe quite clearly is whereby I went kayaking it was maybe when I was err I'm around fourteen years old fourteen or fifteen years old
and that one minute I swallow a lot of water
so after that one week then my instructor from afar he heard my the knocking of my kayak when I was uh stiff capsize
then he heard me then he quickly rushed towards me then offered his kayak for me to to use as a support to gain myself stability
so that was one of my near death experience I almost drown cause I drank a lot of water and almost suffocated that is one
and another near death experience that I can recall uh is when I was
err riding bike uh it happens maybe due to
err rushing factor that I I wanted to go home fast cause I just ended work
so it happens when there is two lorry in front of me initially I didn't know there was two lorry I thought it was just one so I was following the lorry behind
and that lorry was moving so slow so I decided to uh overtake him when I wanted to overtake him on the right
he signal right okay then I decided okay give him way to the right then I overtake him on his left and when it when it happens that he change lane I arise my engine to move on his left
that was when I realised there's a second lorry
at that point of time I had to break because I already speed up and when I break I
free still my back tyre and I almost skid but I managed to gain control of the bike
so luckily nothing serious happened I did get out of the lane to gain control of my bike but nothing serious happened on that note and to me
accident happens when people rush or they are not focused on the road so from through this experience I I really took it at as a lesson to be more cautious and not to rush when you are on the road
interesting point maybe we should move on to the next uh topic that I have in mind which is err a new hobby
what would you want to have as a new hobby can be now or maybe like
uh ten years ago that you would have picked up or maybe in the future what will you want to learn
or maybe in the future what would you want to learn as a or to get into for your new hobby
hmm whereas for me if I were to start a hobby ten years ago I would start skateboarding
cause now I see skateboarding as a interest so if I were to start maybe ten years ago I would definitely be good by now and
now that I want to learn is also skateboarding in fact I just started and what made me start is that err there was one one of the days I had a dream whereby I was skateboarding I don't know how to dream come about
um synchronisation and body movement that you have to execute and it also is prone to injuries
and for me at this age where I start skateboarding
it's difficult because once I injure myself it will take a very long time for me to recover like for example uh few months back I accidentally sprained my ankle
err I landed wrongly on the board
and then I sprained my ankle and that sprain actually took about three weeks three weeks for me to recover fully and even that three weeks I I feel still that is not properly recover yet
and even after the three weeks I tried to learn to get back on the board but I still find it difficult and maybe that is the negative thing of starting skateboarding late
had I start ten years ago maybe I would I wouldn't have faced what I face today
but I see a lot of people at my age they stop skateboarding so I wonder why they do that so maybe in a few
minds or maybe yes then maybe I would figure out why they stop skateboarding in the future um a hobby that I would pick up is maybe
diving I have an interest for diving also and to me I find it very interesting where people can dive and if especially those free drivers free divers
those free divers they can go uh deep in deep water in just a single breath to me that is very interesting
and why I took uh I looked at is at it as interesting is because I tried to hold my breath in the water and I managed to get like two minutes fifteen seconds and to me it was very good but compared to the free driver free divers I I'm actually a noob
so you have anything to add on

hello
yes
okay
so
hais
there goes our effort early
anyway
just
find something new then
okay lah
no lah as in for a staycation it's a nice place actually
although
not much that you can do in that bugis area

velocity
eh no I am just kid
oh is it is it that's why
ya you're not you're not supposed to fly like five or ten kilometers away from either these two places

um
alright we have just made it to the one hour mark
um

ya
yup
anyways
how are you
that's good
ah ya
I mean it's just only one game so
I think
that's a little bit too much
okay ah I mean like
technically
technically you can't copyright that shit because you edited it to
you know
way beyond its for creative use ah
like you can't really copyright that shit
eh fair enough
ya
they can't demonetised you if if you are not monetised right so you know
err ya I think that's different
mm fair
oo ya okay I get it I get it
is it not bad sia
I mean I mean at that price range quite affordable already sia considering like
okay lah okay you you can't really upgrade it but then like at three fifty
two correction two fifty that is
cheap as balls
the new rising five
okay
ah uh huh
err it's like five in india
somebody copy eh copyrighted ah ya copyrighted ah
somebody copyrighted five so
five they Sony can't release five as five in india because it's copyrighted
how I know
I mean there there's gonna be a legal battle ensuing about it probably but
true
but then Sony Sony will try to
probably ah I think
probably will try to buy it off the person ah
because it's like
it will be really wanted to be a dick about it you can just copyright
one two three four
ah ya and it's Sony so like you know he's you know he's going to get a lot of money from it
really
oh four chat that's disgusting
that's terrible
correct
ya no okay push to talk isn't the issue it's more of in game comms has been
traditionally very shit
after teams speak but then
team speak all of this you had to pay for the channel
ya lah you had to buy
ya discord is like you open everything you want to create ah create ah you want create how many you want you create but then you don't have to pay for the room but of course like at the start of discord it was quite okay ah it was rocky ah
like if you compared team speak with discord team speak obviously better ah
I mean it's just a brand name only ah at this point
you know like some of the products are good but then like
majority of them is just brand name like oo look at this Razer whatever
buy for
you know usually it's fucking expensive ah but then it's like
eh ah no I'm not about that life man
man
no ah not about their life or I mean
the products are way to expensive
it's not
ya lah I mean it is a gaming peripheral ah but still like
at least limit it ah like at at least make it more
marketable or more friendly in that sense
like if someone wanted to buy Razer they would be like oh Razer
and then it you know if it's a new person that buys it and it's like they don't know what to look for
and there's a lot of products out there
recycle model
but different name and then you know it's always going to be more expensive than the that one by then there will be a sale on the older ones
and the older ones like
eh that kind
ah
with my current night shift
like at least in my previous company right night shift I had something to do
like I'm quite active okay this person is there that person needs that okay got problem here there try to rectify okay can
but this one is like I'm sitting in front of the computer like oh my god then there's like four screens
and each screen has different things
okay lah like the two screens at the end is your camera screen after that your main working screen is the one that you are looking at this the second one
then the screen to the right is
the map
you can search for shit lah like
whoever ah whoever say something right then err or the expressway or whatever roads and you just search they will appear on the thing
you can do your job ah and then like cannot ah
you know I'm not a coffee drinker
it's just boring siol
ya but then
true
but okay this this is the thing that I don't expect from this sector though is that they will pay you
for the entire month at a certain date like mine they will pay on the twelfth but for the entire month
like like that I work for the first few one week
two weeks then after that take leave for the rest of the month get paid already
I still get paid
ya lah no lah leave
unpaid is
I think when you haven't confirm yet like the first three months
or six months
uh I can't even take leave at this point
I mean I can ah but it's just unpaid
it's not the entitled leave
but ya like
usually usually the probation is three months some companies is six months right
okay ah depends on the company lah but this is this is one of those that is three months then I get all the medical benefits and all that nonsense ah but
the travel expense though it's free
can use for other things or not you know seven eleven can pay by EZ-Link right ah I thought can but no
but
ya I got scam
the transport allowance is transport allowance ah you can't
you can't
use it
ya because they kind of paid due to do it
ya I mean I mean they paid
you in cash for it whereas this is more of a
not ya
like a token is a token more than anything ah
then it's like every month you just get topped up back to the original amount
I mean you can't I can't
it states there in the contract that I can ah
let anyone use the thing
sial ah I have I have to use it
anyways you just more or less a tracking system for me ah
no lah it's them for them to track their employees that kind of thing
but then it's like
I mean like eh there's this other card
that you can apply for
provided
you can reliably prove
that the company is making you travel everywhere
so like err if you exit
the quantity that the the travel allowance right
then you can like prove that okay that I'm travelling
uh all these places and I'm exceeding my allowance my transport allowance
because I'm travelling for work that kind of shit then it's like
not really ya watch cameras ah
like I'm just saying there's
there's uh
hidden thing to it lah like if you don't cause like you exceed your travel allowance
then you have to pay for from your next month's
you might as well apply for this other thing which apparently is unlimited
but ya
ya
but the thing is like you have to keep proving that it's company expense like they are making you travel then
ya then you apply ah
no ah
like where the hell am I supposed to go sia if I'm watching cameras all day
I mean can ah can is can ah like the
I mean the
no ah
anytime ya
and then there's no there's no place to eat also
like you eat in the no you eat there in the oops room itself
like you don't go out to eat then come back
uh I mean it's true ah I can't really you can't really like changed that aspect of it because at the end of the day it's you're bloody job is to monitor the cameras and like if you
are not there to monitor the camera then you're not doing your job then like
pointless right
so ya but then again also like sometimes the the job gets so hectic
that you are so busy with that one then it's like you want to eat but you cannot eat
no obviously obviously you eat after and before lah but
ya that's true
I mean I already enjoyed it
like if
but then okay that's the other thing that I didn't expect from this ah job
then usually town food bloody expensive
so I got chicken rice three fifty
like sial ah where you want to find chicken rice for three fifty
in town in town
uh ya
ya
like even hawker centres also are not that cheap
and plus this period some more
what to do it is what it is ah but yet
I mean we are more or less
stabilised
and twelve few days ago
a few days a few days ago also
ah zero
but ya more or less we are stabilised
we can start opening already
if we wanted to
ya
but the sad part is
the whole world still burning so even if we open we can't really like travel
right ya we travel to australia also same thing
no no the sad part is right
singapore australia open on the eighth
eighth was it no eleven
we already open so we can travel
to the countries I mean australia but the sad part is if an australian citizen travels to singapore spend the time here for holiday whatever comeback they need to pay
because they they're australia itself is not open
you can go for travel
but the country itself is not open yet
we are open to go there but they are not
ya lah
eh no
they don't have to they just have to do the swab test
then
is
fourteen days siol I think you just swab test to say that you are not you I mean you don't have it then after that you are free to go after that
but ya
okay ah not really okay ah
it's not it's not a fine it's more of
something like that lah like it's a tax kind of thing but it's not really a tax
something like that
ya I mean that's true
it's like what uh
I heard from my aunt it's like three thousand
australian
so an australian citizen comes to singapore comeback then they need to pay the three thousand
ya I know
two thousand plus I think
uh I think what one dollar to ninety cents something like that
ya more money that kind of shit
then everyone goes there then after that the then now is like what okay ah
eh but then new zealand that time got uh recently I think yesterday got a few cases because of the travellers
mmhmm
mmhmm
I mean we have the resources to spend
to do all these test
okay
one and the other thing is we are more or less generally
quite submissive ah
like whatever government says we kind of have to follow otherwise we get the rod
but then it's like
that's worst I'm I was just putting it nicely okay but ya
so like I mean if you compare us to other countries there is like you know their freedom of speech blah blah blah all that nonsense then you see lah what happened now
three hundred thousand already
uh huh
ya
yup
two hundred thousand
it's already three three hundred thousand
and then the other sad part is
it's all people of colour
not
ya no that's the thing their medical system that is flawed as fuck
you see eh go into the A&E
they have their own pricing on it
like whatever
ah that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it because they charge whatever they charge whatever for whatever treatment that the want to give and then in the end like the bill comes out then like sial ah
like who in their right mind can afford that kind of shit sia like if you don't have insurance in america you are fucked
oo
you you will be so screwed
three something like that ya
ya and the thing is you can pay by instalment if you don't have the cash
ya
unlikely unlikely
true
then it's also zero percent interest what so you are not paying extra for the stupid
ya lah I mean late payments but like if you're if you're choosing to pay by instalment and you know you can pay that amount every month and eventually it goes away
it just takes awhile only ah I mean there's also like you know like you don't want to pay instalment already you have enough money to pay everything then you pay everything ah
ya
okay
really
uh huh
oh is it
ya borat is borat lah so
I wonder if they edited that out
uh huh
I mean to be okay ah no ah
no no then it's it's on video it's proof enough like they'll find I don't know I think they will find somehow or another to turn it around
it is what it is ah but you know it's fucking video proof ah like even
even
even the
the law enforcement system
right you know how everybody saying that police are body cam supposed to be
are submitted for evaluation or some shit like that right
no it's not it's not they switched off
I don't know which state
said that
uh they shouldn't submit the body cam anymore
because
it shows a lack of de escalation
ya
ya
and then is like as long as the story tallies then is like you can't really say what
I don't know lah which state ah one of the judge lah they said they shouldn't send the things anymore because it just shows that they are doing a bad job
like I mean their police is already that terrible already but it is what it is ah
ah
no comments no comments
in
in other news right whole world is burning
that might be true for taiwan soon
I think world war three should start soon
err china
planing on the invasion already it's in the work
the thing is now the threat seems very real
because the eastern side of china the one that is closest to taiwan right they upgraded the middle the missile or some shit like that then is like the thing can now hit taiwan ah
I mean that's not really diplomacy anymore
considering
eh ya
I mean to be fair they've already taken the majority of the world
taiwan is part of china and then
I mean ya lah like
and they could have just let taiwan
be as it is
have their own government but no
then like
really
so you you
so you can't have a people's republic of china and a democratic republic of taiwan like no
I think they call them uh D D C P right eh no D C C
oh wow
I mean taiwan is kind of like singapore
just
much bigger
okay I mean
okay let's be let's be fair to them they are their own country
they are their own parliament
it's just that another
ya that
okay lah
that one no comments ah ya
it has it has been like this for awhile only it's just that now only now their making news of it
uh huh
uh huh
legit ah
oh wow
uh huh
ee ah ya
that's malaysia
that's the issue I mean
ya
you all busy fighting each other also lah
kan
damn
that's
one sixty that you could have spent on something else
ya
oh speaking of fuel the that
venezuelan ship no one going to save the thing
ya
no
ya
crude oil okay ah it should be fine but the problem is if it
if it sinks
kan I mean already is sinking
that's what I'm saying is like because the area around that ship is going to be contaminated as fuck
coast line
because coastline you can clean
that's fine
it's already dying I'm just expediting the process
just because of one person
ah
why
no
ya
basically
that's also true
disguised toast
on fucking tweeter of all the places
really
that ya
in social media ya that's
ya that part I know but now I
I didn't expect that he's still active
a lot of the country don't agree with that lah but okay ah there are the backwater parts ah
the backwater parts the backwater part
the beginning of the congenial work at chomp chomp
it's just I think this happen only because
crap I forgot I don't know her name she was playing among us
no the
A O C
A O C
nah
yup
week
sial ah
uh huh
it's basic human nature lah what you expect
no hell no
they will donate what they can just so they don't have taxes
ya per year mind you mind you eh
per year for a bloody tax
and that's
correct
right yup
no the thing is new world
and if people still believe in my legs
no hasn't been proven or there hasn't been
ya
ya lah
okay
uh huh
okay
wow
he couldn't take the delegation or interrogation other questions ah
differently
ya
ya I mean
it is it is what it is ah it's his style
either way it eh no I mean he's no he's trying to imitate china basically
we don't they do obviously the country is like that because it's already like that
what I've said is correct
then you just have to believe eh
we might as well be
kim jong un
oh my god I don't know ah sia
it was but is a guy he say I love the bible bible
ya
ya obviously
you would have a favourite somewhere
and that that is trump in a nutshell lah eh
okay
how do you think are chomp is affecting economy
who is making economy great my business is booming again he's asking like what what what business are you in your what are you doing oh I do uh money money money lagging
oh wow
correct
yup
I don't think public transport is affected
ridership
ridership but then it still doesn't affect the whole
thing as a general and Grab drivers yes
because
obviously the company will care ah
ya
obviously not
ya but the thing is to grab drivers will hit the hardest especially the period
that one terrible siol like
only essential workers what
me ah
then like yours truly ah
work essential service not really essential
ya
not all
Grab drivers they only had their subsidy through their
they got
it's not even that much sia
taxi yes Grab no Grab their rental was it was what they cut it down by thirty percent forty percent something like that but they still had to pay whereas taxis
it was free like sial ah they can sial ah that's why you see a lot
of taxis during the period just waiting doing nothing
that's the thing they can they can afford to do that because they don't have to pay rent and they just have to pay fuel
but then they don't have to drive around
because like why should I drive around when I need to pay for the fuel later so I just wait there
where as the Grab drivers they still had to pay like what fifty bucks from the right from the amount that I was talking with them like the rental they had to pay fifty every day still but then during period sial ah how to earn fifty sia
okay ah not not everyone can ah but that's why that's why during I had the same driver a week straight sia
he live somewhere ah there like nine hundred plus there I think
then everytime I book eh same guy tomorrow eh same guy
and like okay ah ten minutes only what not like I going anywhere I just take like for Grab
I don't I'm not really that
like unless on that day I overslept or something
rare ah but then only then I will cancel
but then other than that no ah
it was at boon lay
don't know call call message
everything no reply
siol then I like what the fuck sial wait here half an hour already siol then the thing still say ten minutes the fuck you doing sia cancel
no ah
it's justified
anyways okay you you can cancel within five minutes
after five minutes then you cancel got charge right but then like half an hour already sia
kan
just cancel get a new one
but then the thing is you don't
you you you don't directly
uh
okay lah ya there's there's the more apt way to say it lah
you collect the food already
then you put delivered
like you wait already you wait and wait and wait
oh ya ya ya ya
ya
or those people in I mean the disabled people
hmm
ah
but in singapore majority of buildings have lift what
like rare you find
that that one is dorms
eh well
service industry lah eh
the woes of it
you get you get that kind of shit ah you get that kind of shit ah
you is body disease
better than the previous workplace then start
everyone was you know up in arms about it
bloody supermarket getting cleared out and shit
is like you know what like
months of rations it's not even officially yet that kind of shit then it's like
and usually the thing is
there's a pro and con to it ah
usually by then on the shelves will be cleared and they'll be restocking
but then if you come too early
got nothing for you
but then you have to come just the right time that they are restocking the stuff then ya
the supermarket if it's a twenty four seven supermarket they'll be like one or two staff only at night ah
cause
mm
ah
okay lah I mean
the one that I went to was somewhat like this
there's only one entrance and one exit lah so like you can't really run away
and then you have to like you does use your
safe entry shit go in then after that buy whatever you want to buy
the cashier doing restocking
then like
but lucky got bell ah got the service bell so like you know if you want to like do whatever shopping that you need already then after that you ring the service bell
then the person will come
ha right
then provided you got exact change
I'm helping do your job
but ya I mean that that period ah
the the one that people were all in panic
that got one customer order until like fifteen cartons
of mineral water
mind you eh not the six hundred no
one point five litre
we have our fair share of idiots
everywhere else in the world I mean our percentage is not that much compared but there is still so like you know one person say like this everyone say like this then becomes hive mind you especially know the older generations
because they have their own group
clique thing so like one person say something everyone will believe it you know that kind of shit
why
why
but ya
ah
like okay ah if
if you go out of your way
to try to verify it then I would understand ah but then like you know
you post in the thing then after that you believe like eh siala
this thing ah like that like that like that
then like
free masks don't know how many times already they updrage the mask some more

err save money kan I think from your resolution to eat healthily and to grow your own food you can actually monetise from that
maybe you can make YouTube channel
how ya how you how you grow your own food from scratch a'ah then we'll see how it grows then from the products that you plant then maybe you can make a channel uh on how to make your own vegetarian food
ya
mm mm
mm
err want it to be
I want it to have plot twist
in a good way
after twenty twenty one eh twenty twenty one ends I have then one hundred percent that I will reach
yes
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
yup that's nice
because the last year the whole year is me just working my ass off like everyday you know when back in two thousand nineteen I was still a student eh ya I was still a student then
err I have my student life which is very interesting
I
um I involved in so many social program clubs and all
then when it comes to twenty twenty I started to work
it comes with costs lah which is I don't have time for myself anymore and ya I I went to work at eight then
err more me time
ah I want I want to in a easy way to explain this I want to upgrade myself
that's that's my own definition of me time ah
yes like personal skills that is not is not related to my work at all
ya this is something that I really want from
from like twenty years back when I was young
I don't have money and I don't have the effort to actually to pursue that ah
I want to enroll in piano class
to be a guitarist
yes I'm still keep it I'm still want to live that ambition you know not lah not to be like professional guitarist lah no I want to be something like more elegant which is iffy I know
when I was err in primary school I actually learn how to play the keyboard ah and I did that few times I made performance in front of the school
playing keyboard
mm mmhmm
ya
ah
mm yes I think that is one of the reason kot for the shift in preference to
hmm maybe
but I still I still like to play guitar actually I feel
uh I like to listen to people playing guitar and I still have the interest but for this time
I want to play I want to learn to play piano first lah
mmhmm
mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
mm
oh is it I don't know about that but
um
living in a country that have chinese in it I think it will be important for me to
know how to converse with them
err instead of english
mm mm
this is good for my networking lah
mm mm
err and
I remember that
err I really have strong interest in language because back in
back in high school I try to enroll in as many language class as I can
err sadly only one language is err permissible for for for a student err we can only choose one additional language to learn

get up
and do it
like right away
