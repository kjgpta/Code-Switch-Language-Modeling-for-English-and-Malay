so then he don't know why okay this part this part is err a bit scary part ah he don't know why but he went to panjat to the downstairs the scary part
so it's like you can take the ladder to go downstairs to the first floor punya fire fighting store
downstairs is confirmed locked apa
if upstairs tak buka then korang downstairs is like even worse it's gonna be locked also
then he climbing down the ladder he looked down gelap kan then he saw like a figure in a corner like swing back and forth begitu

then I thought like okay lah maybe cause tak cukup tidur ke tak
salah bantal something like that
the situation sekarang COVID
ya because got crowd control so ada banyak-banyak timing so
tengok timing lah selalu kalau timing jam satu gitu lepas lunch ah
banyak orang because they all rush in
ya ah then especially kalau pakai mask kan ah tu lah
ah kan ya then I don't know I feel I feel like I a bit rude but at the same time is just takpe lah eh orang pekak so biarkan jer
ah ah seh just to ah kalau pergi shopping mall pun susah kan walaupun nak beli like one thing only like bubble tea
kan kan like um so sometimes like we just want to minum air and then like people just suddenly stare at you like chill I just I just drinking water
orang pakai mask but never cover the nose like
ah kenapa
eh apa dia buat
mmhmm and then apa
basically okay lah dua macam dua alam like malay call it dua alam
I tried going on dating apps ah you know ya ya ya Tinder Muzmatch ya especially that so bila I kat sana then
it's just the way that they text the way that they reply sometimes I don't like you know sometimes like the way they spell certain stuff you know like you can just say it to me in like one long sentence but you have to kasi short form macam
uh they are actually quite hype they they they boleh berbual ah everything but
you know what I I don't really like you know talking to you you know like just ugh very cringe but it's just you know sadly some some of them are actually nice it's just suka it's just a preference
so ya talking about that tu pun
can still use your picture obviously because if not it will be catfish lah technically kalau
right so so macam kat Telegram or what then you send the video message thing at least they know like ah okay this person is this face but the name
lain lah but tu jer maybe your age lain sikit maybe your birthday lain sikit
okay maybe one of us who are like twenty one years old nak berbual dengan dorang then tiba-tiba I don't know kena
I don't know she was a minor because she never put in her bio or something and then who's fault is it you whose one handcuffs ah you you kena
you kena what house arrest ah that one
you kena the watch on the
I think maybe to a certain extent boleh macam
macam orang yang buat macam gini just to be like a predator or something that one is a no no
okay ah so hari ni makan apa tadi tadi makan apa
ah lah takpe sama I had the Nissin seafood one very nice
seven eleven one ah ah okay lah not bad sedap juga
eh apa nama dia
dulu bila kat sekolah it's just um
I had a crush on this girl so biasa lah eh like cinta monyet everything and then just macam oh my god secondary school ada mata air baru
and then ada lah kawan ni from primary school
and then uh well I have it's just like you like I had a sus feeling you know like the vibes and everything so so okay but I still ignore lah cause I thought like mana tahu secondary school it's a different ah ya ya ya like even though it's like primary six to sec one
dah mature a bit lah ah
I was talking to the guy on the phone and everything I selalu bawa dia ajak dia into the conference call like that because okay lah me being you know seeing her as my
best friend at that point of time macam
you know I want to include you and everything I do so like I tak malu lah ya so but then it's just the the stupid thing is that um
before before that night a few days before the dude and I dah confess so so we we okay lah we say that oh I like I like you too and everything it's cute but then the thing is we confess at playground with letters we roll each other letters you know ya right it's not over over text like I I state my no lah
so on the night we were talking and everything then I ask him lah like do you do you want to go to the next level gitu biasa lah eh you know I dah desperate kan so and then he like ah boleh jer like I okay because I suka you and everything and I'm like aww okay apa-apa jer lah so as long as you and I together
cinta monyet I just said it
ya but for us we don't use puppy we use monyet so monyet because it's ya it's playful basically because we
we see monkeys as very playful so like that lah but I feel like kalau puppy love is quite cute
where was I ah so during the phone call and then we were talking like that and then my best friend was there then dia dengar jer lah so she just like okay tak tak kepoh lah because I ajak so it's fine macam member sunyi
the whole school his whole cohort dapat tahu that
ya I mean that's how much I sayang her as a friend lah that I the first person that I look to is my ex that time so and then he was like takde ah takde cakap apa-apa like you think I that kind of person to share and like that then I was like okay lah mana tahu
after that we I just like okay lah takpe I lupakan jer and then
yang perempuan tu suka dia juga so ya hmm tak player is he he's just never been in a relationship before except except for with me
apa lagi eh so lepas tu
the girl that used to like my ex uh before my ex and I got together she she hated me lah cause I so called aku rampas dia punya
ya then aku macam
bro you you never make your first move how how is it my fault precisely how is it my fault also ya sure korang suka each other but if if I like him and then somehow he fell for me also and then okay lah then that means I I put in effort what and unlike you you just you just like you see from afar and just like hi then for me it's just like
ah padahal dorang ke apa okay no hate lah sia no hate but it's just
not spending time I prefer befriending ya I forgot the word befriending dengan lelaki and everything because they very chill sure you need to find the balance between the guy friends lah
because tak buang waktu sia like kau
kau penat-penat kau berbual dengan dorang kau lepak dengan dorang and then setakat they just like eh your friend single or not then like what the fuck bro
sikit jer ke banyak ni
deserves maybe you guys never you never end it off properly macam tak sedap
itu not
steep cut but kau tak cakap apa-apa then why why would he
I I tadi marah because ada orang terlanggar you know then like your girlfriend will just rely a'ah I faham faham but if you tell a guy is just like
setakat dia cuma langgar jer pe ah like that wait maybe maybe I can say we are too sensitive or kita overreact but
hmm tu lah get out but I got this story back when I was in I had this classmate she was very clingy gitu macam dia
dia dia tak ada banyak kawan lah because dia pendiam then bila orang
sama-sama but for her it's just how to say ah
setakat aku nak kawan dengan semua orang dalam class so
kalau apa-apa nak berbual it's okay lah like rather than you just have beef with everyone like for what and then
lepas tu she became clingy then mana-mana aku pergi dia nak ikut then it's like ah dia dia perangai macam lelaki like she insecure lah because she she's afraid of people abandoning her so when I talk to other classmates she will just like
eh asal kau berbual dengan dia sia then aku macam
biar ah aku nak berbual dengan siapa and then it's like and then it's like ada ah project and everything so for project work
I had to choose ah I was given finally given the chance to choose my own group because dulu is dorang main ambil jer lah which
which was sad because I had those free loaders and everything and lepas tu I didn't pick her because she herself was the free loader
but she she she never realise because sebagai kawan I never tegur because out of kesian right you know like it's your own friend you sayang your friend and everything
and then she she text me she sound me and everything she say why why you never pick me for your group and then aku cakap
oh ah aku tak pick pun dorang yang pick aku
I bohong ah because I don't want her to get hurt but in the end she did and then in the end she found out lah ya and then she
and then bila tengah buat project then she will complain like uh you know akunya group macam gini macam gitu then
but that one I feel like for everyone is normal you know if everyone if everyone if someone just overly control you you would just feel tak sedap hati macam apa sia aku buat aku dengan kau siapa sia kawan jer
okay lah just share share sikit leh dengan
lepak bawah blok eh ah
okay that's cute I guess macam abang-abang ah gitu kan abang-abang yang bulat ah um ah betul betul betul
oh sombong eh ah oh ya that's true
cakap jer lah
so cili padi is like small and feisty and spicy
member kucing ke robot pun tak tahu
ah so the youngest all the very degil-degil bukan ke oh shit
alah but so high so high with energy maybe maybe oh but with other people a bit oh malu-malu
so dia dia tinggal kat rumah atau
kenapa kau yang jumpa atau your family members your other family members oh
anak derhaka ni lu dengar eh dengar eh
wow that's cute um alah cute nya tak payah beli bantal ada kucing
ah so that's why you call cili padi
macam especially
ya it's just it's just ayam masak ya that's true
I don't know what kerapu
I think I tengok first because usually for me
something fancy for tengah hari lah makanan tengah hari lah
uh nasi you know
fancy tengah hari macam nasi kalau malam more like salad lah because of your condition right because of your kencing manis right your diabetes
for the for me the kids kalau ada nasi ada ikan they will eat lah
uh but I don't want to buy tadi bila I beli ikan tu I tak nak beli banyak ikan takut nanti simpan dalam ice box bau so I rather just buy satu ekor ikan lah
dari beli dua ekor itu hari I beli dua ekor abeh tak dapat habis
you know susah nak habis abeh end up buang you know so I rather not
sebab tu tadi bila kat sheng siong tadi
I beli satu ekor ikan aje
uh tapi ada kala pula I feel serba salah when I do that kena beli satu pula nanti the kids I want some more fish you know macam
kadang-kadang pula bila masak ada plan tapi mak bawa makan ke
you know atau my mother give food untuk uh she packed food from from her house right then she give also that would also
I have to wah I edit punya rak
tapi semalam punya not not that bad lah but it's just a simple two three pages
jadi macam eh
you know macam if you sit you if you did it this way for your write article you will have less problem lah I would have edited even faster but semalam I
I edit tak I didn't really require a lot of time lah think within less than one and a half hour
or less than two hours dah habis ah edit
uh tadi I berbual dengan my
my russian teacher tu the skype over skype eh
he would we were still talking about music cause last week we were talking about music so he ask me he was err he was a having a conversation with his friends our uh what some he has some friends from thailand so he told me yang
I and the song was from tokyo square then she's like tokyo square so he thought that dia dari jepun ke group ni then I at the moment he said that my eyes lit up I said yes he and I think he knows that singaporean lah it's a singaporean group he did a study but he he actually he did a research and he found out that the group was a singaporean group but the song that he quoted that he liked was uh
but the song actually nice tapi dia pakai lagu sukiyaki punya lagu tau do you know sukiyaki right there's this
uh it's not an original so I told him that when I was young I follow kak tina to this concert by tokyo square
uh that is the originally is from tokyo square but there's some uh famous mat salleh singers sing that song lah western singers that err sing err tokyo square punya lagu but that is I say macam singapore okay comparatively to russia over to
a lot of talent lah they don't macam you know
uh but dia punya melody has been reused and reused by other bands lah but that is not the most famous tokyo square
uh because like I mean nama tokyo square tapi dari singapore you know macam
because my I think kak tina did some events ah for local music group in the eighties so when she also babysit us so she
and that they were performing dekat mana tau kat depan if I am not wrong eh at this padang area near parkway parade
no macam this area dekat depan parkway ke sebelah kat parkway ke one of those area lah because parkway was you it was like a famous lah you can see shopping shopping mall shopping center dekat eighties nineties mana ada banyak
I think kalau mungkin mungkin yang singapore yang rock band lah yang dulu-dulu ah
ah the malay rock band ramli sarip all that there is known tapi for the english
medium eh english medium tak banyak that's why tokyo squares is one of tapi yang you kata sam willows sekarang famous there were a few ah
like they say kembangkan dia punya talent ah
you know macam yang ada english the err english medium ada but they are not
they are not world famous lah macam the their world famous because they perform
like macam siapa jacintha ah jacintha abisheganaden I think abisheganaden is it halim
but macam you have err macam art fazil you have err jai eh is it jai is it the
I think macam we we we know okay like macam acting a lot of them because of the
the khairul anuar join siapa apa
the malay channel lah siapa tu
ah not really talent train lah it's just that they give opportunities for them because there's a market macam kira malaysia ada market you know
macam nak cakap pasal comedian ni semua macam kita hantar kita hantar comedian pun comedian macam err suhaimi eh suhaimi part time you know at least dia dia part time mostly full time you know so he doesn't really get to hone his comedic skills that I know
no I think macam pasal singapore banyak pakai script
singapore the the ah they're not very good with improvisation tak bagus
ah I I I understand macam boboi boboi punya jokes eh boboi the group the maharaja lawak eh kan they have boboi they have the different
ah what is that either let like either when they talk about loghat eh there's always a tema tema like like loghat like is always going to be malaysia menang because singapore tak pandai buat loghat you know
they can really do loghat know and they really are very good at imitating macam singapore punya macam they are not that fluid their ability not that fluid
you know macam malaysia really bercakap loghat loghat is accent right kira loghat orang kedah orang kelantan and then
kita punya loghat is loghat bahasa baku
no no but they are very professional I remember I pergi err the not kedung kodek what's that
the maria hertogh riots thing right so the I remember I was watching pi mai pi mai tang tu at that time was imuda imuda that there were some people sayang they can perform on stage four to five hours I mean it was a three hour show three hour plus show with interval almost four hours they can really they have really showmanship they are really professionals you know
because they can really perform ee apa tu they can really perform macam
buat masa yang berpanjangan tau macam ada stamina is really that atau buat orang macam orang pergi kelantan kelantan they they the people doing dikir barat
they can really do dikir barat the whole night you know because that is like their training you know
uh macam for us it's not like that at all that's why I say it's amateurs lah
the yang yang lama-lama lah
dia kata orang glamour ada what is that ah
that's the not singapore idol the one ya they go to malaysia dia perform astro punya lah
I think astro punya organise so ya guest judge was
ah tapi dia ada all the the veteran singer so hady was face off with this other
ah so they have this person in the end dia menang dua-dua two of them memang kan
why now you know macam like in a way kenapa sekarang kenapa tak dari dulu lagi kau datang kat malaysia you know
ya pasal dia dah then he wanted to stop then he went off drugs right then he he he decided that okay this is really menyanyi is really his talent you know
no but macam I remember when I was watching those chinese drama series eh
junior eh yuan ching you tahu you kenal dia was she some
ya zoe tay was from your ni
yuan ching yuan ching yang dekat jurong eh
no but but you had that yuan ching punya alumni yuan ching punya alumni is it yuan ching
yuan ching macam hancing the the yuan ching punya alumni dinner right you eh
err your friends apa ashik eh siapa
amin kan dia orang tak pergi eh
I told you the three of you form a table what with your other friends and sama kelas
now memang susah
cikgu ahmad said macam pernah dengar jer
is it badan besar rambut putih eh
ya macam macam macam seroja was telling me she was retiring from right I feel so sad you know
you know to be ya I mean be err get get new more books you know but macam the way he said like they said well you know like the wood that's it for me man and it's just macam seroja
you you are I'm not I'm older than you sayang
ah tu ah si si siapa was telling me these millennials ah because it's
ya but for people to retire they should have money right all that right mana tengok seroja I tengok kesian ah
dia beli rumah tu about satu point satu satu point dua juta tau
you know the the the my russian course mate that that wanted to uh buy a house right that one right she told me that she wanted to sell her house pun err
uh it's slow down macam orang pun tak nak beli
rumah dia kata rumah dia sepuluh tahun dia beli rumah tu I think
uh dia pun nak jual dia tak nak jual
macam tinggi lah tak nak jual harga tinggi lah she just want to sell uh
ah and then she will she loved to cycle at east coast so it to her it doesn't make sense to cycle dekat
her condo tu kan not near the beach right so macam
to her is an effort lah to go back and forth naik basikal di situ and I think a bit ulu lah because situ kan jauh kan
she like cycling but macam
she looks amazing for her age and then she also does ballroom dancing so it's very interesting but macam
for me when I see her I tengok I don't think money is a problem of course she like to
macam is typical of err they're people from their group right they like to think about money they like to make more money but I think for her to be able to
macam still tinggal that rumah walaupun rumah tu belum jual and still have err her she's start to pay ready for her house
no no hers was second hers was a new lepas tu dia kata ada
ah tapi besar because rumah dia belum habis renovate eh because they had to for stall the
uh the no the the macam kira development dah habis semua tapi orang semua I think they nak renovate ah sikit-sikit kan
tapi pasal renovation kena put on hold because of the COVID
so I was thinking to myself oh not bad eh dia tak payah jual rumah in order to live in that place you know
because most people they have to jual rumah so maknanya dia ada duit juta-juta I mean she's already nak dekat enam puluh lebih dah enam puluh nak dekat enam puluh lebih gitu and therefore someone like her not having to sell the place
maybe she has the money ada duit juga ah
that one betul-betul ada err pool or view of the pool ya
tiga tiga bedroom
she say three bedroom but I only went to her bedroom because her bedroom ya is the one that opens directly to in front of the very nice sayang it was like
uh I think I think for dasha dia terperanjat tapi dasha memang tinggal condo she shared with a flatmates dulu dia tinggal dekat sekarang dia tinggal kat condo I think she found a new flatmate eh and then macam kat kat russia kan they don't have this quality of
uh so it's a bit you know she's also quite aware lah about the development about about buying condo uh that dasha is aware so macam macam it's very sexy lah
no I think she stay I think she stay at condo because dekat itu dekat dengan russian nya embassy
and and then dekat bukit timah dia nak dekat dengan nature agaknya orang putih gitu kan
ah shared dengan ramai ramai ramai
I tak tahu I never ask
uh but I think she like the location agaknya
uh because this mat salleh they like their nature they like
uh dia naik bus dia dia orang naik bus
because maybe the flatmate yang dia suka yang sekufu dengan dia agaknya
they're not really macam kita a bit rude about money we talk about money like macam I can ask audrey and she doesn't feel offended but if I ask the question to audrey I think dasha will be uncomfortable
because it's not something that europeans like to talk about macam
macam it's not really the thing lah macam us cakap berapa kau beli berapa kau jual
you tahu this this year I don't see her spending anything dia tak beli baju baru
mungkin dengan boyfriend dia ke apa kita tak tahu kan mungkin ada boyfriend lah
kalau like that okay eh
uh but sami suka
macam dia dia kata dia ada swimming pool kat depan rumah dia tapi tak pernah guna kan uh that's fixed to me condo lah
macam some of the aminah punya friends right they tinggal condo ah
uh macam err I guess that's macam we have friends in I remember I have friends in
I mean we are just three room four room dweller but that this fence pula tinggal rumah sebuah tiga tingkat they're they're thinking already and the way they speak already different
yang pak ali eh you know pak ali always get the best grades macam dean's lists lah borhan also the one the radio warna right but they were from it doesn't
macam ya people used to think that err
he was educated sayang he was educated when he was young he was educated in eton tau
did I ask him what did you do he's baba budak orang baba
dia kalau sayang kalau dia hantar dia pergi tuition
dia pergi tuition do you know how much people pay to teach him tuition
uh teaching macam he has he has his full time job
even after tu dia continue but then he will still had the student that he were charged a lot for you know so macam you know you have this
but he's very nice lah I think the reason why he wants me to be the partner is because his german is better than mine he doesn't want a partner that is much better than him of course you know so every time kita because when you have a partner you have to have a conversation and your teacher have to observe you berbual and then dia dia dia punya orang tidak apa punya orang so most of the time we speak melayu and baba so
I cannot go to germany but when he went to germany and he asked me what do you want me to buy for you so I I ask him oh can you get for me this this this this you know like the like from the then he will get for me lah of course lah he won't pay for it lah but because it's my mahal right so I pay for it but it doesn't matter
but it is like you order it it will be more expensive so he went over there dia beli dia ingat I don't know how it is now terrence
no no no dia nak pergi actually tak nak pergi singapore
tapi dia kata dia not good enough lah dasha kata sebab tu eton they didn't choose it didn't choose her but actually eton then after that the eton got
a professor but dia orang lah
or american eh but very fluent in russian and then because err project was saying in oxford you have people doing other languages but macam macam russian only a few know
uh tapi be you know why they go to russia because dia punya tuition fee
singapore I tak tahu but uh
so there were err she was speaking russian to her husband and dia she have two children two or three children they all go to sabah or sarawak then after that yang orang kat belakang dia there's this man ah err medical doctor
dia kata oh he he he spoke to her he spoke to her in very fluent russian and he actually learns err medicine in russia
no but I think is in a hospital in malaysia dia orang recognize
I think wait singapore punya that they have a different different tu ah
because I remember my friend you know yang arwah nadim tu yang meninggal tu isteri dia
belajar medicine dekat kelantan lah if I'm not wrong kelantan also
but kelantan ni banyak
but kelatan punya he he actually don't want to go there he doesn't want her to stay there
tak recognise kelantan punya medical certificate
so that's why she remained in malaysia he works here so sometimes dia come back
err to be dia kerja kat mendaki kan arwah dia until he very sick already he went over there
um but yang your friend tu siapa
yang your friend tu yang follow kita tu pergi kashmir siapa tu
you know that the hair stylists yang I pergi the hairdresser tu yang pergi kedai cina tu anak perempuan dia tak boleh masuk dekat medicine school dekat singapore so she actually took out a I think two hundred thousand dollar loan
so she want the daughter to but I said can practice she said can your daughter said can practice that's why dia pergi sana tapi dia takut anak dia tak nak balik dia kata anak dia suka australia
ah because dia tak stress lah macam singapore
kan bilang
err so pula dapat keluar pergi luar negeri
she wanna do psychology from what I heard she wanna do psychology siapa si
ustazah yang teacher that the
class no that the degree that they have like for example yang daripada
apa eh
it's not considered a degree level macam for example you want to be a teacher right
yes that's what my ustaz told me
so macam it has to be like they recognize degree
jordan I tak tahu
could be ah because mak dia mak dia tak nak but but but uh the ustaz kata that's the reason macam for example kita dapat second upper the second upper uh or first class you got your pay scale it they are not even considered degree
ya that's why like people say why they go to madrasah for that's the big question everybody ask
agaknya ah tu
I don't know now err COVID I tak tahu ah
so that's why a lot of people recommend pergi jordan
there's dia orang punya
kan itu hari si king of jordan datang
I don't I don't see her posting anymore because usually she like to post about those people who come from afar cause her part is medical she's actually in the medical tourism line where she does translator she does translation for people from middle east like which I think she know five dialect a few from eygptian like tiga empat daripada eygpt and then she knows other dialect lah so dia kata ada kesian because she was telling me because dia kenal-kenal dengan ustaz
ustaz hasan so dia bilang ah dia bilang dengan I lah some of them come from negeri yang you know they come from kampung so only know dialect tau dia orang tak tahu so they don't even know so she try to bend here bend ah
and this lady have a condition ah dia kata then I ask err your cousin eh how do you translate all those medical term to that because she needs to know what she's getting herself into eh a'ah kak tini bukan senang you know like nak kena ni nak kena surgery nak kena ni can you imagine nak kena like you have to a bypass and how to you have to talk about the heart all that I said if you need to talk in a dialect how
she sometime tunjuk gambar tunjuk gambar gini cakap lah nanti orang tu boleh faham dia kata and then the sad thing the sad thing is the embassy spend thousand of dollars on these people agaknya derma I think embassy derma agaknya and then spend money on them you know err spend the money on translations err these translators
oh ya because the the king would err hussein not hussein I I I kenal bini dia uh he was very impressed the singapore side very cepat very efficient
but when I was telling doctor ustaz hasan ustaz hasan apa dia showing off
uh that is the rumour lah that she tunjuk the jam
ya but it's also something that has strength lah because her fusha is very good like the orang arab dengar fusha lah yang I try to berbual dengan ustazah hadijah
itu fusha but okay so macam the the difficult dialect is not egyptian lah according to them lah but I don't know I tengok egypt in dialect very different because people say egypt punya dialect very near fusha the standard model standard arabic but if it drove many people don't speak more than studied arabic everyday
banyak orang arab banyak kan very diverse
dia tinggal kat egypt itu dia tinggal mesir dah berapa lama she even take she even take talaqqi courses at the the famous egyptian scholars when she was there she told me
also she taught she take talaqqi she taught she taught me how to tajwid
she told me yang the and then when I ask abi abi say betul
ada yang ustaz yang famous sampai boleh kalau you buat salah your bacaan sampai boleh ambil you know your you know the what is that thing ah
when they collect the smoke the cigarette punya ashes leh
like garang ah
let her bukan poly tak boleh pakai tudung pakai jer tudung kat poly
or you want her to go okay lah go pakai then there's the other thing lah
I think err tengok appetite dia macam math and science
in singapore you cannot do well macam
macam I don't think so lah
err namanya
tak tahu ah I just tak cam tak ngam dengan dia sangat lah but she's very close to murni so now she's the
punya translation unit she she's the head you know
pasal I selalu berbual dengan dia
then I made her watch asian alida bahasa melayu I even I even err
gunakan err
apa tu penterjemahan eh
penterjemah subtitle ah dalam bahasa melayu
dia suka ah mula-mula tak suka mula-mula tanya apa mak maknya tu kau tak sayang nyawa kau eh you know the cerita ejen ali kau tak sayang nyawa kau

eh then si affaf macam mana sekolah dia tu
sekarang what we hear lepas tu ada kata start january ada start march what you have to start you know much ya okay the thing is
err tu lah I mean the the the
correspondents tu macam last time when I go melbourne study kan
in seoul is one of the agency other agency pun ada so like this uh uni oh kaplan one of it is there any other agency
uni mana apa buat
but if there's no choice how rasa if
the one that those without the apa is without the examining examination tu macam mana
so nak kena ambil I mean it's the same
if she opt to other macam early childhood
can she use the diploma or tak boleh pasal dia tak bridging
ya example kalau oh this one ada the next one is this one is uh no not examinable
that's two lah satu sama ada dia nak ambil with examinable
and also must know whether the diploma if she has tu boleh pakai tak nanti kena ambil lagi kan
cause if she wait again dah she waste one year ni dia wait again tiga bulan
I thought she say dia punya sekolah macam
career gardens apa
is different course now this the uni is still exist lah I mean the the this the studies only the courses no more kenapa low intake ke
but the thing kalau macam because now pun she take the bus pun she will pay adults fee just no school pass kan
mm waste about five thousand one year I think is probably that baik go to other place seh
consultant I don't know then one time you just trash out nanti tak tahu lagi
this is kaplan tukar dia punya uni kan with these courses
can check online tak
cause now is limited time eh sekarang dua puluh plus
I her other friends sekolah mana private mana
kaplan juga bukan
with her behaviour seram
your lifestyle lah kan macam
campur-campur orang okay uh jaga diri
because suasana lain tau suasana part malaysia suasana part suasana part
ada tau ah
tu lah yang si ustaz anak dia kan remember murdoch apa yang ustaz salim pun kan you just uh go over to malaysia lah rather than go
what you can when uh other uni other places kena start dia punya tu kan then from there
kalau kata recognise that's a plus point lah kan I mean singapore to malaysia tu wah one more year
tapi tak ada uni photography eh ada ke
cari apa tu lah you you you sign up with uh intern at Sony
uh ya yang yang yang resale ah resale of
post apa post recruit people
anak tiga tu eh
is it matters if you plot english and english and maths lain english lain
uh uh you I think tak payah you can just put a survey K put a survey
ah now SAM ada new uh so called syllabus come out for english
are you if you are offered are you interested to be uh enrolling your son ke gitu lah kan
from there then you see kalau ratio dia only about ten percent
tengok uh I don't know how you I mean you can limit to one class lah kan
kalau ramai orang healthy response then you can consider open kalau tak healthy then
better ya cause we don't want need to to be up to student the student then one teacher I mean you buat habiskan duit on that
no I didn't do anything tak ada your one
I tak buat apa-apa
dia suspend
suspend jap
so what you saying is what oh ya english if both english uh she can ajar english dengan melayu eh english dengan melayu
english and maths then is much better lah then for si apa tu si
the tutor tak jadi eh no no the uh chinese boy is one thing lah kan this thursday jumpa you kan si yang yang keng kok
eh so post post ke
or no partnership you can say lah is difficult administration susah I either want to
nanti at the end kita bergaduh susah safe
then you can you can say lah now pun dah fifty students
mm first day dia datang just take it okay
and some of it with the P two lah kalau dia ingat
apa tu all all the progress report
then you going to apa tu send it through WhatsApp lah kan
I cakap it can be WhatsApp eh I say to you ah that day
no the thing is parents kalau
ah cannot cannot can't be bothered tak semua turun can count
the children tak kasi
then apa tu that day oh ya I dah bayar stamp fee
kena bayar lagi another six months
supposedly you know lah we aim to for for yang to take over kan sekarang kita ada but I will see if after six months he
dia tak payah become funder ah because macam
okay I fund you okay you run tak gitu lah you must be committed
apa yang tu I mean we can change lah apa yang
tapi I
kita nak dia to be a chinese kan kalau dia is a eurasian
ada patient tak ah we're going to wait for what what what
but if the children going tak tahu juga seh
then then you ask him about you are staying juga eh ah about journey travel
dia tak is his ah
dia graduate ke apa
kalau kan dia ni main intern teaching long time lah dia mengajar
just now you say I'm just from something is it his uh secondary school kat mana
itu jer bahasa melayu yang awak tahu
so now he kerja part time part time ni lah full time lah
okay lah dia dah tanya you tak tahu kalau dia
but eh ya lah but the thing is kalau he is okay I willing to do these two hours first kan
his is dia punya rezeki dia lah kan if you don't want to be
in situation yang menyusahkan oh okay nak terus okay jer
but the thing is uh dia dah approach lah whether he is the type yang I tengok dia badan besar
kalau dia is the funny guy apa macam you know he can uh communicate with the kids ya first he's a guy kan
kids semua suka girls ladies
gitu ah if this guy is that one that uh can communicate uh friendly then he's it lah kan
we might just uh end of the contract lah kan macam tu lah
cause the the you can see the sepatutnya apa
apa uh expose the student yang you have to serve the six month ah and you want to have that
nisa next year tak tahu cerita
hey lah how are you man dah lama tak jumpa
really really long time semenjak aku last jumpa you right so how long do you think kita dah lama tak jumpa
no I think kita tak jumpa for quite some time I
it's way before COVID so COVID started last year right err last year when do you remember bila dia start
COVID bulan sebelas COVID bulan
okay COVID november ya so I I definitely did not see you this year at all and now it's already december so dah lama gila
early last year you know what what I can remember from my memory aku rasa is that
aku baru balik daripada my overseas job I came back then after that I saw you with your wife then after that kita dah tak jumpa lagi for a very long time then suddenly the next news that I got from you is that
err my mum bilang aku yang nurul is pregnant was pregnant and then after that eh
it's time to go you should visit your brother he's is over there and he's going be a dad soon and asal kau tak jumpa dia
and we used to be very very good friends semenjak kita orang kecil lagi
lah you know what I was actually like in my mind right I was thinking when was the last time kita orang jumpa I mean when was the last when did we first meet up
when we this did we first meet abeh kau nak berbual english pun dah susah kan
err from my memory is that we went for apa tau performance ya you know that that was like some bengkel kanak-kanak or some do you know remember aksi mat yoyo when we used to be there was remember that show aksi mat yoyo it's an entertainment for kids kind of a variety show and then we
err we met up at mak long punya okay so mak long aminah suriga is the like the producer for those kinds of err shows in entertainment right
let's put it the main woman yes pasal dia it's a woman ya I don't know whether she's still alive I hope that she is you know
mm mak long
then kita orang and the stage was in between the living room and the kitchen yup remember that right
ya so aku I remembered that ah kita start performing and then after that we became friends
because our our parents are friends not parents our our mums are kawan baik
aku pun tak tahu how they became friends eh yes because okay you know what let's let's not talk about that because okay maybe we can ask them later it's about us because we have not been catching up and and we we start from where we first from where I first remember
when I met you dulu
rumah mak long correct so we started dancing and then we did a few shows dekat err bengkel kanak-kanak punya macam performance and then I remembered doing shows kat situ with my sister dengan your sister dengan you together so it's sriwana yes yes you see now it's all coming back
yes I think kita orang were quite active in performance because I remember um quite vividly there was this particular show kita orang semua nak kena remember that that song old mcdonald's had a farm
old mcdonald's had a kebun is it kebun in malay
engkau ada topeng lah but I do not have a topeng so what I need to do was with my face bare out in the open I need to because lembu kan ada horns right so I need to be a lembu with horns so what I did was during the song of um old mcdonald's had a farm while everyone was wearing dia orang punya topeng
kita happy go lucky just go with the flow mak cakap apa kita buat then after that jalan jadi lembu taruh tangan kau jadi jadi lembu then just joget
you were a duck I remembered kau itik kau itik because they had if you remember there was this disney nya itik
and which one is donald duck don't know that ya ya ya you were donald duck but the one with the sailor blue sailor hat okay that's donald duck okay right just try to be err not confirm just to be sure lah kan kita orang ni iya lah kan
err I remember that you were donald duck and kau joget macam biasa lah you were happy confidently you know yes
err you were itik okay so
lupa ah so err the next memory is bila aku dengan kau we were in your dad's car
baru balik daripada some performance that we had because we had a few of those performance right kat luar some lah community centre dulu dia orang cakap apa ah
ya ya ya we all so it was it was actually quite err at that point of time I did remember that kita orang we will performing for orphans and all this right so ya we were doing ya bro then I I I remembered that err we were doing good stuff lah which we did not know was good at that time
ya err aku pun ingat yang that that we get to perform then after that balik so getting back to the memory yang in your dad's car aku ingat bapa kau because your your your bapa was driving a red colour car a small one do you remember the car that was a honda
so kereta tu dah takde lagi dalam
okay cool cool but I remember kereta tu kecil then after that your dad was like you know so he was turning left and right right so every time kalau dia nak pusing kiri ke dia pusing kanan ke and so we were at the back dengan aku kita duduk kat belakang and then after that your father will drive the car and when he turn left we will like to the right you know like oh so we made so much noise that the the ya the three maybe four five years old ya rollercoaster thing going on very irritating to the to
yes it's definitely irritating and looking back at it right now kita dah tua ni kan it was very it was because it happened by mm ya so I'm not sure okay so your
pasal your bapa suddenly pusing belakang then cakap can you guys stop it or not
so I was err you know I got quite scared of your dad daripada hari tu aku macam eh hi uncle
ya until now ya I respect him you know not because of that only because he he's your dad he's a old man all these lah and he's he's a he's a wonderful malay guy old chap yes aku rasa
maybe dia bingit ya I mean we kita orang deserved it seratus percent we deserved it
overall your dad is a wonderful person you know err I'm not saying anything bad about him it's just that nak bilang kau jer that was a memory ah ya your turn
I remember those moments of education yang aku tak
really oh that was so sweet of you aku feel so err yes
yes aku terharu orang cakap so
really pasal aku kawan baik kau ke apa
engkau bukan seorang ya
oh I remember I know where you're going with this I aku tahu mana kau nak pergi dengan ini benda
ya I I I I that what that is another memory which is quite traumatising for me as well pasal aku ingat at that point of time kan you had a bike you had a bicycle you had a bicycle and that bicycle ada tank warna kuning it's a bicycle with a yellow colour tank then lepas tu ada seat kat belakang
untuk kau duduk then after that that bicycle kecil tau tapi mati-mati kita nak tumpang each other it's a chopper
I I I I try to describe it ah so so we burn the the matches right then after that we as okay we burn the matches we blow the fire out then after that we put it in our mouth so that the smoke will the yes the matchstick into our mouth so that the smoke will accumulate and then when we open our mouth it's as though we are tengah hisap rokok ah
ya it it became like a campfire thing did we were we arsonists did we burn any macam dustbin tak kan
it oh ya yup yup near our house ah ya the one opposite our house kat rumah bawah block farhan if you remember correctly
salah brother love
john J A B C D E F G H aku pun tak tahu
ya I aku understand what you are trying to say because for example let's say we meet someone right and then kita lupa nama dia and then after that nama dia apa then we will go through all alphabetically just to try and eh he looks like a john you know oh ya ya he is a john so we I I go through that thing also I believe apa tau lah like they did err they did a study about this dia orang cakap apa tau siapa yang dulu um buat show dengan mak long gitu
mm siapa siapa the kids that buat show dengan sriwana so they have that it's in it
I think we should say thanks to her ya if err if you know like if I get to see her eh mak long hi remember me she probably wouldn't pasal ya
ya you can say that I have a janggut it's okay because I I saw you staring at my janggut and aku realise yang kau tengok dengan macam
ya ya I mean like to continue the whole janggut thingy if you want to stick to the topic like for a while if you do kalau if you don't mind janggut ni sebenarnya apa tau if for me kan aku punya janggut ni sebenarnya aku ni pemalas
aku malas mm
ya because I realise bila kau malas kau jadi gemuk
ya but gemuk is okay because you know err I I don't mind but
like I am one year younger than you if kau ingat betul-betul aku sebenarnya aku sebenarnya muda engkau setahun tapi muka jer nampak macam ten years older from you and of course aku punya attitude is very mature
err yes and vice versa so every year we will go through that thing so we seldom see each other kita akan jumpa each other bila err macam nak balik sekolah so kau kau balik sekolah aku baru nak pergi sekolah dengan thing sometimes
okay okay I I try to I try to from my memory lah because I'm one year younger than you so I probably have a bit more okay so err what happened was err after primary school kan pergi secondary school tapi aku went to a
secondary school which is quite far away from yishun you see I went to saint andrew's school err which is located dekat potong pasir so jauh ah saint andrew's kat potong pasir so saint andrew's dekat potong pasir err aku had to do my early journey blah blah blah while you were just you know like early journey to go to school because school kan mula pukul tujuh setengah
I have to wake up every morning at five or five thirty pagi then after that make my way to school by taking the or the bus so I start my journey probably around pukul enam pagi sampai sekolah tujuh setengah then after that
normal timing correct so during that point of time we jarang jumpa each other because I was busy with my school and then you were lucky enough to go to a school which is
dekat dengan kau punya rumah so which is northland secondary school
it's the view is wonderful from your house right the the view is wonderful from your house because err there were fields there were schools around it there was no flats blocking kau punya pemandangan kan
that what you must be like terkencing dalam seluar eh
confirm kena rotan with your mom confirm kena rotan with your mom I remembered because your mom is err your mom is very strict err woman from bila aku pergi rumah kau pun mak kau pun macam quite err err how to say how should I put it eh verbal
ya she's she's fine with me I I I I actually you know what I I love her until now because sampai sekarang mak aku dengan mak kau masih best friends you know I mean I mean not as close lah because age and all this perhaps you know then after that you know like all almost all relationship goes I mean you tend to fade away and then after that datang balik fade away datang balik but I I appreciate the
you know until now because you know in fact tomorrow is my mak aku punya birthday ya and guess how old my mak aku is
mak aku is sixty six years old lah that is err there's quite a that's quite a an old age sixty six years old you know
like you know what I remembered that we actually bumped into each other for for bulan puasa punya time
bulan puasa punya time remember we went for during ramadan we went to the mosque I think like once or twice we bumped into each other so we did catch up but just a very short time it's it's nothing like this
yes either that or kita pergi sembahyang jumaat
yes so we did lah but not not not for a very long time lah sekejap aje kita lepak then after that err I bumped into your dad
err he went to the friday prayers yes so I bumped into him and I said eh uncle err how are you because your dad always speaks in english then mak kau berbual melayu so you have that that that both thing right so then after that
ah then after that um ya so um your dad aku jumpa dia then after that err you did ask me this question before eh bapa aku umur seventy almost almost eighty years old kau cakap gitu dengan aku then aku ingat macam eh
are you sure your dad is almost eighty years old kau biar betul dia nampak macam muda tau
mid seventies right so that makes sense you know when you say bapa aku tak tahu bapa aku umur dalam lapan puluh tahun kau biar betul your dad doesn't look like you know that ya because he's actually strong you know like he looks alright he doesn't look frail and he still you know he he's still can function as a old man
same bro but not my dad lah my dad will exercise tapi bapa kau keluar rumah ke he should be at home or dia keluar rumah
amazing macam bapa aku juga my my dad will wake up like early
but tapi you know looking at him stretching aku rasa he is still you know quite active in that sense pasal sekarang
err during on his birthday right two years ago I think aku belikan dia basikal for his birthday present then sekarang baru nampak tu basikal keluar as often
ya rather than to just stay home watch blah blah blah you know it's better to be active outside especially when you are old you know especially the government right now kan dia orang dia orang kasih err facilities for the old people untuk dia orang workout
correct ya yes correct correct so err what happened was speaking about this right my my dad retired so what happened was that he got bored and then he decided to masuk class ah join a class yang singapore punya funding
I forgot what is it called future or something like that skillsfuture ya so dia orang ada this skillsfuture punya thing so my dad got interested so he sign up for some err security course so ya so
for his retirement he would probably be you know one of those security guards bila kau nampak kat condo then after that eh uncle how are you
okay lah same same lah like yesterday also takde ubah sama aje like that lah
is this your transition to talking about music are we done talking pasal kita orang punya growing up in stages are you sure you want to go down that road lah sekarang
yes yes that's a good segway actually because um I mean it it still sticks with me I mean like most people I guess they are you know they love music right so just like us you especially pasal aku realise engkau sampai sekarang masih macam err doing gigs touring and all these do you still tour do you still buat kau punya music semua
hmm okay err is it it's due to the whole COVID punya situation sekarang kan
oh you do err facebook punya session like live punya session is it oh that's cool you know what I found out that err one of our friend's apa ni boy cazly because I did meet up err met up with him the other time which was like maybe a month back somewhere around that time lah so sekarang dia
when we hang out that time dia cakap dengan aku yang dia baru buka a new studio where he will do live recordings and he will pay he will post it on facebook as in for live show I
believe it or not I do not have a facebook punya account I am not a
it's weird because everyone is in it everyone is in the whole social media thing and you probably get to know information or I mean like current situation information daripada you know the social media but untuk aku I
more reliable that one is more reliable but at the same time macam
the reason why I do that is just tak banyak sangat information coming in from left to right too many points too many um you know opinions from the social media dia punya community
tak I don't know kalau does that make sense to kalau aku cakap I I like to be alone and I'm not lonely hmm do I have an imaginary kawan
okay so like basically just to be updated dengan dia orang ah
so what you're telling me that you have like err you have you are talking about facebook right okay so dalam kau punya facebook tu you post like funny funny things
let's even up it a bit more hundred and ten percent agree with you pasal engkau I I I realise I mean knowing you as a friend for for a very long time you are very positive err person seseorang yang positive lah senang cakap
because how can this guy selalu macam gembira ke sana ke sini ada jer macam funny and nice things to talk about you know nothing dark nothing you know like for me if you were to sit a little bit longer I will start you know coming out with a conspiracy theories and all this
kelakar seram kadang-kadang ada pontianak kat belakang whatever oh so then you know that that's just me but for you right I realise as a person and I really appreciate you for that for being that kind of person because ya pasal sekarang ni
you know there are a lot of um negative people out there especially you know if you look at comments in youtube I do go to youtube though tengok comment comments kadang-kadang video video guitar lah music whatever so there I will I like to read the comments because they are just
ya ya ya this is relative to dalam bidang kugiran music selamat hari raya kepada all the people in singapore
hmm I'm not really sure about what you just said that like are you being truthful kepada diri engkau
actually aku pun aku pun suka orang malaysia lah but depends orang I mean individual you can be in malaysia you can be in somalia you can be in wherever country africa whatever whichever continent is that is you as a person macam mana kau treat orang tapi orang malaysia pasal aku ada banyak sedara my uncles my aunties in malaysia yes
my mother is from penang my mum is from my grandmother is originally from thailand so what happened was that err dia orang fell in love then after that my grandmother and my grandfather err ran away dia orang lari kahwin lari

of numbers so err back to my my my grandparents then after that they got married then err they stayed in penang dia orang duduk kat penang then after that my at one point of time my grandfather like went to singapore and he got a job here in singapore where he became a policeman also something like that I'm not sure aku lupa

kakak aku is currently dekat hong-kong sekarang as you know then he she has her own family kat sana they're happy over there they plan to come back actually for december lah ya they actually bought the tickets and everything then lepas tu err because of the whole current COVID situation dia orang terpaksa cancel dia orang punya flight lah
his name is a tricky one lah err pasal dia pasal bapak dia is a french dude then my sister is malay right so um
nama dia is luq L U Q and then after that ada L U Q luq luq luq
kita orang ada luqman orang melayu ada luqman ya so err
luq lucien so that lucien tu is very particular pasal orang french kau nak kena pronounce dia orang punya language in you know because they they they love their language so much it's and I agree that it's very sexy language aku memang suka bila orang french berbual
you know pasal tak kisah lelaki ke perempuan ke orang tua ke orang muda ke the language itself is just
very sexy it's not beautiful it's just sexy hmm so I like how they they pronounce err stuff and the way they talk especially bila dia orang dah start berbual french abeh nak start berbual english lagi sexy lah but let's not get too deep on the on the sexy part nak kena
okay music part oh so okay sorry you're you're you're done with me ah with my family alright I guess aku rasa aku punya family tak interested tak interesting aku rasa okay ah berbual pasal music ah no lah nah I'm just I'm just kidding that's why that's why I love you lah because you ah whatever mean things that I think is quite mean and then when I say it to you right you
you don't mind and you just brush me off with a laugh and whatever and I really appreciate that some people kau apa ni berbual pasal aku punya keluarga macam gini you know that kind of thing ah
terbawa-bawa terbawa-bawa abeh balik rumah then after that they will scream in the pillow
let's not get into let's talk about music let's stay above water level and talk about the music that I'm listening to macam apa yang kau berbual tadi
roughly um you know um err as you know I'm working from home right now right so aku ada banyak time kat rumah then I could been listening to no at first I bought a I bought a guitar I don't know guitar apa nak beli you know this is this is a typical um you know typical if if people were to hear my story it will be quite typical because
why would you know like a mid life guy have a buy a guitar at this age you know right why what's up it's just pasal aku ada banyak time and I just want to pick up a new hobby yes no it's okay
yes lah as you know aku dulu main drum asal it suddenly it's all about me now let's talk about you why I why do I feel that I'm interrogated oh ya you do
yang penting kau terror wow that should be that should be your next err malay album punya yang penting kau terror
dengar lah kita orang punya record baru which is called yang penting kau terror
ya dan sekarang aku main guitar and I have to say that I actually am not good at it even after like a year of learning it it takes a lot of dedication nak kena invest kau punya time main guitar and you and I I have to say I start I started quite late lah I started quite late then after
I when when I get to know you again during the secondary school punya time at the point of kan kau dah start main guitar you know and all this kau dah start main cranberries kau dah ya you you were playing like bar and not not like full chords you know full guitar chords which sounds amazing
you know and aku pula when I was in saint andrew's school kan aku belajar drums so after that then we at one point of time we started a band together then you then bila kita masuk band together we had a few of our friends then kita masuk a few competitions which I mean not to brag but we got you know
yang penting kita terror yes just like your the name of your future album
ya yes pasal okay err the reason why I got myself into the whole which is electronic dance music pasal
at that point of time kita orang punya band dah tak ada lagi then after that kita orang decided to go our own way separate ways then everyone was you know you know leading their own lives gedebak gedebuk so I got lonely as I usually would and I started listening to um dance music
some techno punya stuff some err defected err record stuff which is quite cheesy lah to be honest with you like err they they call it tech house tech house so tech house is just like fall on the floor punya beats macam that kind of music so mm
so aku dengar um techno aku dengar tech house then there were few other house punya genres ah so they they had err like like like different
genres like sub genres ah within that that genres so I listen to specifically macam tech house deep house that kind of thing so err it got quite deep and then after that I started listening vinyl so I saved up money got myself a turntable then after that
err I had a I had a good friend who used to listen to vinyls as well so we got into it together then we started then after that kita orang dapat a few gigs kat sentosa dapat main kat club gedebak gedebuk we had fun but to be honest with you that kind of music I mean like yes it's we were growing up you see then it
the music is still strong I loved the music actually I love the whole production aspect kalau nak buat music tu I prefer to do that rather than to listen you know rather than to be a and to mix like
a a disc jockey dia orang punya kerja ni is to mix err satu lagu dengan satu lagu
so dia tak ada stop ah
yes for so for example macam ada satu lagu if he's playing in turntable A right so that lagu belongs to an artist correct so from my err end of it I would like to produce my own track I I would love to have my music in the in the playlist
lagu original it's preferable lah you know you know that's the reason why like kalau nak have a band to play err like cover song I mean you can do that but you know it's like practising is like practising other people's song when you have err you you know you have your own creativity right you want to express it and you have to want you want to create something on your own so aku rasa that is the part where you know we have our own band kind of thing
remember when we had our band we were playing other people song and then kita orang nak kena macam belajar dia orang punya chord belajar dia orang punya style of music
in that kind of genre lah in that kind of context mm ya I mean the whole thing for me aku rasa tak
although I did that for quite some time you know I think I did that for probably around like ten years or something like that ya I was ya I was playing in like um in sentosa which is an outdoor punya outdoor like
disco discotheque mak mak cakap discotheque kau pergi discotheque tak ah pergi discotheque ah mak
ya like a pool party kind of lounge so I went to I I was the resident there for every sunday and then lepas tu aku manage to do my own company so I hooked up with err a friend of mine then after um together he was from america then we kita orang joined forces
err aku rasa aku wait wait sabar sabar aku lupa aku lupa aku lupa that was quite some time ago err so we bought that brand then after that
we all hat candy hard candy so we brought that brand hat candy into in singapore then kita launched kita orang punya own party ah so then we had we fly in the we flew in their to play gedebak gedebuk then
ya it was fun because you know you get to create something even though I mean it's not music though that I created I created art not say I created I mean we we me and my friend we managed to bring in more entertainment err value to singapore which which is at the highest standard err at that point of time then kita orang
buat duit apart from that you know we err charged people at the door kita buat duit dekat dalam dekat bar
so we managed to make err money then after that it went on for for quite some time then after that things got sour I don't want to go into too much detail dalam tu then ya lah
err now I'm back in my room listening to some dirty blues and playing aku punya guitar
out there in the youtube world sekarang kalau kau tengok kat dalam youtube you know

so like I read up that it was like uh macam satu adventurous and then satu lagi practical like bila sama-sama dia bagus and dua-dua macam bara api gitu jadi macam passion gitu lah
I don't know ah I don't know belum lagi ah so ya so ya but I forgot our I forgot our chinese zodiac
api jer eh
ah tapi tak lah tak lah garang sangat kan
to betul-betul macam
I macam lagi dua ke tiga gitu I pun terlupa around there lah
I think so lah tapi I think his is at most four years gitu
electric engineer eh electrical engineering ah gitu-gitu ah
uh tapi like
he was telling me also lah like he don't really know what he wants to do with his life gitu so takde direction gitu so he say he want to go for course counselling I say okay go go go go go good good good
thought that err because dia punya poly punya course takde exam
so he thought maybe ada exam lagi senang gitu then he thought like maybe like even without macam passion he can still macam buat lah macam survive gitu but then apparently he's like not surviving very well
ya but then he say he finish exam first lah sebab besok dengan besok besok ada
ada exam
if you ask me I say go ahead lah macam if you find something that you like and you really find something that you want to do that's even better than suffering for
ah baru twenty five seh
as from engineering dengan engineering gitu kan
oh boleh macam tu eh
ada strategy tu
macam investment kot I don't know lah eh
tak that's the thing like macam he knows
that he like suka and he wants to do like research in the industry gitu but he don't know where to start and how to get there gitu
uh uh that's what I told him also like that's the first thing I ask macam asal tak pergi digipen like why not then after he say eh I got search for that
then go electrical engineering baru eh
ya ya ya I nak minum air
kerusi aku ni pusing ah
macam suruh dia pergi course counselling ah
I am not the right person to ask also siapa lah aku kan
tak tahu bila lah but some day inshallah

so sekarang ni twenty twenty jadi next year
uh huh two a'ah betul two
entah lah tengok dulu lah lepas kahwin kot
and I have no pressure to get married so dia macam so you know what don't stress
lepas kahwin baru fikir ya
once your suami is okay with it then like if anybody else says right you can just like kau siapa suami aku cakap okay apa
uh uh kau siapa
maybe in two to three years then I'm like okay lah kau fikir dulu lah
because to me it's not about the duration is not about macam oh lepas dua tahun nak kahwin oh lepas tiga tahun nak kahwin no it's more like
that's why cause kahwin tak senang seh
ya sia mahal seh

uh and then the tacos I didn't try but then adik said it was nice
when I went then the there's like it comes with like a main so I bought the main and it was very nice it's some seafood soup something like that then you cecah dengan roti
uh but then paling best tu barbecue barbecue dia
cause like the sotong and the ikan and the ayam
tak dia barbecuekan dia macam counter kita just
of all things kan ada sotong ada sausage mm okay ada ayam then you know what was there
but I don't know maybe kita tak tahu makan or something lah maybe we just don't know how to eat lah cause we didn't like it ah very much
it tasted like meat you know then I'm like what is this it's very strange ya but then the good part also ada tempat solat
sebab ada banyak benda-benda kan
oh pahit eh
it's just it's just hilarious lah cause every single time then hazim will be like nak pergi staycation then I'm like what me and you
ajak him first
kekek seh
but I don't know whether abang hafiz will be okay with him and if he will be okay with abang hafiz also
can you imagine abang hafiz with another abang hafiz okay then you just put that in mind
think in the end eh in the end they will just like abang hafiz will call you and then hazim will call me like
tapi voucher belum lagi dapat
uh because tak ambil leave mm
baru boleh ambil leave
ya cause now also I need to take leave then tengok budak-budak sekolah ke tak
ya cause dorang deaths I mean not deaths lah but like dorang punya cases like macam tak terjaga jer
mm mm did you see the numbers everytime umi right like whoa wah malaysia punya numbers naik then I'm like umi
it's always because of like macam
tak lah like the whole show I think wasn't that macam
cautious about it dorang macam tak berhati-hati nak ikut rules tau
and then people are saying like that's only the one that's tested then the one yang tak tested
ya and their country also not that develop like especially macam tengok the medical facilities and stuff kan dalam the hospitals semua tu
it's the culture lah like dorang tak macam
gabra sangat lah I will say ya that's why
ya lah macam conspiracy theory lah
I mean in an emergency and pandemic like this kadang-kadang cannot help it
terpaksa you know because of the resources that they have and stuff like that
so macam it's sad but
terpaksa ah
mm entah lah eh kalau orang tua kita yang paling degil kot macam dorang yang selalu lawan why cannot why cannot wear then after that nanti dorang yang
dorang yang selalu marah-marah orang tau I always see you know all those like boomer whatsapp video then always send one right
then it's always it's always the older population tau is always they are the one that is scolding yang budak-budak muda then budak-budak muda pun nak cakap apa
just follow the instructions government cakap tak boleh government cakap if you don't do this fine three hundred dollar not I say one I say not I say one this one governments say one ya
wah and then there is me I was at choa chu kang interchange okay I was waiting for hazim you know I was waiting for my boyfriend and then and macam cause I came early what dah siap kan jadi duduk dulu lah kan you know dekat drop off
err when you drop off ada kerusi-kerusi gitu
so I duduk situ at the drop off area duduk dulu lah tengok TikTok ke apa dulu ah
tengah lepak-lepak habis lepas tu sebelah like
then after that kita macam kita pakai mask kita tak kita tak berbual pun dalam I didn't even notice she was there I swear
then I was just like tiktoking then after that suddenly this group of aunties right like I don't know where they came from also tapi tiba-tiba dorang datang tau like this group of like five aunties I think they came then after that uh dorang macam berbual-bual at this area like very near me ah beside this aunty was sitting so I think they were one group
like one big group tapi cuma ada satu tempat duduk so dia duduk lah
ada lima orang then satu aunty tengah duduk jadi agaknya enam lah tu tak tahu I ni macam primary school maths gitu
ya but then jap jap jap jap I haven't belum habis lagi and then right so he halau them already like kesian this aunties you know they just like there talking they tried to adhere to as many rules as possible already they just want to talk you know then uh uh
like they not even like like not wearing not even spitting or anything you just you know speaking you know tengah berbual-berbual jer seh
after that dorang jalan lah maka terpaksa mereka jalan
this aunty who's sitting dia macam tengah macam lengah-lengah lah nak duduk-duduk because baru duduk tau baru duduk
the pakcik came to me
sejak bila aku tak boleh duduk kat kerusi then I'm like
err okay ah okay then I just like perangai sia then after that I I just left lah like my mood no good already lah then the the aunty who was
sitting at the other seat right then she look at me walk I think she wasn't planning to walk but because I walk right then she look at me then she's like aiyo semua also everything also cannot now semua pun tak boleh then I'm like
a'ah nak buat macam mana aunty takpe lah
tak nak kena saman so ya
I'm telling you ah if we don't wear if you never wear mask and someone sampai sekarang eh the one person sneezed and that person is let's say positive eh
liao satu I'm telling you it's gonna have COVID already
ya so it was dah nak kat satu tahun ah oh my god ya sia
wah cepat seh
then after that only because of that kan only sebab uh of this kan then like
dorang punya living conditions got raised up as well which I think is a positive side effect of this I mean I'm not gonna say that it's a good thing but there are some positive side effect is like one of them is like this macam dormitory is only now baru tahu oh dulu kan dorang tinggal then after that I was thinking
cause kalau tak siapa tahu eh like when was the last time you actually lap itu benda punya handle like I don't know ya so I feel like it's a good reset in a sense lah
when when I was like when I use the soap and I wash wash like betul-betul punya wash like scrub scrub you know the eight step gitu kan
be like what she doing why you wash until so clean like but then ada lah aunty yang cute lah cuba ikut juga lah
macam ya but ya now they don't
ya ya ya is like ya I mean that's why I say like I think there's positive side effects also lah I mean it's not a good thing but you know if you think about it another way mm mm ada lah hikmahnya
so macam kadang-kadang like weekly she will ask us lah so how's your COVID situation when we're like oh it's getting better here you know
cause orang tak ikut orang sana tak ikut rule
like it's a law tapi dorang tak enforce sangat
lepas tu selenga I don't know lah I think
have the whole the whole island eh the whole singapore tengah geram dengan dia
check check that one time eh satu kali
it's just that everybody was just wondering macam sejak bila boleh dua belas orang
kalau phase three pun lapan orang jer
mm tapi
in all honesty at least they jujur but actually saya ada dua belas orang lah that time you know even though you might get saman or what but
ya at least dia come clean
kita sejujur-jujurnya eh are we even as careful as we were las time kan
oh my god how macam mana tu
macam gitu eh bilang orang tak payah makan sudah
ya it's basically tak masuk akal
I'm like nak cakap pun fikir sikit ah like
I I think even a secondary school kid boleh fikir that um even kalau macam situational writing eh I wouldn't come up with this
oh wah not bad sia the job like quite chill for me I've been like searching for jobs because like susah lah like I don't know if what I should do with my life right now because I I'm contemplating between like design atau like just a normal working job like not design related
so ya then sometimes some of the elderly like they confuse with the dates of bila nak apa itu bila nak bila got the discount right so um sometimes they will pick a fight lah but like uh uh I'm used to it already they will be like eh today don't have the discount meh you sure or not ya then I like uh
oh my god kesian apa like I okay lah because my one like everyone was very nice though like all the uh aunties were very nice to me and like all the manager and supervisor they were damn nice like ya okay except for the weirdos but like because
ya I also got something like that because ah in we got the self self checkout right that you know the counter so there are times when you know some of the customers right dia orang tap they tap the card but then they never like wait so they will just leave
like that means the apa itu the the money didn't go through so ya then ya then most of the times right we have to chase after the customer and then sometimes right we cannot even like sometimes if we lose track of the customer then we are the one that have to pay for it because if we don't like
then lepas itu err this girl fadreena um I think she was like alone on the trip or what so like my friend and her other friend right they like okay lah I ask her to come join her also I mean join them as well so at first it was like okay ah
and then asked the friend to like teman her at her room cause her room is like not the same as my friend's rooms so she like sleep separately ah then after that right my friend was alone lah like she was left alone lah
like she say about my friend's height because my friend is very short mah so she thought said about the height then obviously my friend hurt lah then she my friend like we like how to say ah err like she kena back my she kena back fadreena then fadreena not happy so ya and then after that like it wasn't like their relationship very like ugh
like uh the boyfriend is quite old not old but like a few years older then she also say about that like what my boyfriend all like old what is your problem then like just cari pasal lah with my friend then ya ya like she think like the whole world revolve around her or what
oh wait i think I saw it was cause if tak salah it was on his instagram still right like the picture of them together but until now he haven't delete meh
the little actions he do I guess like fold the clothes all ya then I saw he also like apa treat treat her right treat her food all sedap seh ya I wanted oh my gosh three hundred it's three hundred
kau serious apa kau serious
ya oh my god it's scary though cause the first thing right dia kan engaged he's engaged and then now he's like what he cannot move on from rachel when he should be like focusing on his wife kan ya exactly
not really toxic relationship lah but like cause now I I think her life is a movie kan like a drama you know no serious cause she got two guys um so right now she's in a relationship like baru-baru jer lah the she apa itu this guy like proposed to her
but not like nak kahwin propose that kind of type but it's like uh girlfriend like will you be my girlfriend ya but then the guy is in so like now she's like thinking whether she should
so now she's like deciding lah I mean she still she loves her current boyfriend now but like to think of having to go through the next two years is also like a bit hard for her so if you are her what apa apa kau akan buat
that time recently I think was just this week lah uh they had a fight then because like my friend right she called the guy because after like uh dia dah at night right they can call already right so she call the guy ah then apparently the guy macam like I don't know why like bingit or something like cranky
the new guy obviously want to beat him up lah it's like really because it's ya like I don't know it's just a bro thing then uh apparently what else ah he got the ex got also like macam maki dia
maki the my friend ya like on a tweet then also wanted to make a thread about my friend but apparently he deleted it so I don't know problem sia ya it was damn problematic ya
oh ya I cannot I cannot sabar so I just watch every week
oh tak as in like for ratings right usually they say ratings is for like we watch on the but for most of us is like we watch on online mah so I think that's why the ratings not as high ya but
from what aku observe ya from what aku observe right it's really like that like every workplace will have that one guy who is tua
like they should look at themselves in the mirror sebelum dia orang nak prey on younger girls like seriously
especially those yang belum legal like that's that's like that's like a crime
burn burn the anak
ya like macam mana kau boleh buat like that to your own own kid sia that's so sad
no uh ya then they say like uh apparently I think either one of the mother or the the boyfriend was taking drugs then it's can also be like the cause of why they killed the child because you know when bila kau ambil drugs right then you won't like know what you're doing that kind of thing
wah so sad oh my god I cannot leh cause you got see or not if you scroll down below right you got see the gambar of the child
ya usually if like terbunuh it's like you the kid is like abused lah like like
no they never say abuse but like um they say she just they she killed the child in like february I think then like three months later then they burn the anak ya
ya then the kawan also like a bit bodoh ah go and help to
ya it's damn sad because like ah the father the the biological father of the the anak right uh was like finding the child but then apparently they said the mother
mm tak kasih tak kasih dia tengok or like tak kasih information about where the child is or what so for like five months I think the father was like finding the child and then end up the child mati
sakit hati sia ya
psycho sial gila sial this girl is gila like gila
aku wah aku embarrassed sia like legit aku macam rasa malu
ya it's not on it's not like apa itu it's not on like purpose it's on purpose ya it's on purpose then I was like wow how can you like put him in a cage all sia and the cage is like a a cage for cats eh not even for like humans or what
they got other anak you know like they they got like the younger siblings leh I think
ya like like those typical macam you know those malay drama right then got the the evil evil fella
hijrah hijrah fund
then uh bastard oh my god itu terus just pergi neraka sial itu oh my god uh
then ya I saw the syed saddiq also oh my god he always kena sial when all the older err ministers you saw the syed
ya that's what I want to say also like because they all like macam oh you must because I'm older than you right so you must respect whatever I say that kind of thing right but end up whatever they say is like really stupid sial like really
a'ah oh my god did you see the kanye mess oh my god I don't know what he doing sial like legit apa dia tengah fikir dalam uh otak dia sekarang
I should just go lah and spend two years in wah rabak pe lima tahun eh kena tunggu
ya like most of them never wear mask and also like I don't believe the cases really like zero in malaysia I I think there's more just dia orang belum report you know when they are sick
ya ah how is he a how is he even a president aku tak boleh I can't I just cannot
oh my god he's so like apa itu macam what's that word uh he's so calculative ah kedekut yes
I've seen so many photos of new zealand in like postcards and I was gila seh
ya bila lah boleh travel lagi macam camper van was so nice right I mean like it's a different form of travelling
bila time nak makan we can makan or like we can just stop whenever we wanna rest
what fifty plus lima puluh
sabar sabar sabar he actually did it
pergi pub eh pergi pub hot chocolate wow
eh so was the first time that you felt snow or macam how was it ah macam sejuk gila ke or like how was it
oh okay eh tapi dalam cuaca macam gitu sejuk-sejuk ah I think it'll be so nice to have a hot drink right macam hot chocolate or like
eh hot chocolate dekat
yup yup correct ah rindu seh tu
yang the one you remember the wombats there were wombats around us there were wildlife around us
ya and then bila wombat tu macam bau kita punya makanan wah he just like crawled up to our door
ya eh how come tak ambil gambar seh
tu ah kecoh saje
for a moment I was thinking like should I throw my pan out of the door so that they can eat outside you know because like kesian when when I saw them at the door they look like so hungry and I don't know like like I just felt like I needed to feed it to feed them
ah lepas COVID pergi mana eh
dia penat gila ah you have to break and make lots of stops right
ya I really hope this goes away soon seh K tak sabar
you can actually leave your car over there kan macam
so macam like that time when we went to tasmania right like we'd I think we got on all kinds of transport ah there was car
tapi rasa macam you macam boring gitu
eh selamat tak seasick eh
weirdly I miss the supermarkets kelakar kan kelakar tak
they are just so lain right
ya lah that's one of our ways that kita nak save duit kan
I don't know I rasa apa dah pakai
err wait err K let me recall eh van diemen's was the one yang kat farm right
and then there was gelato messina which was dekat bandar like the city area
and gelato messina was eh what flavours were there lupa ah
farm and natural kind of flavours like the berries pepperberry and macam all those like fruity kind of flavors but gelato messina was like hip ah macam modern
so macam um I don't know eh
eh amorino yang mana satu seh
yes yes I remember amorino was the one where they shape the ice cream macam bunga like that macam the petals was that the one
yup you know that one ya that was but macam tak memorable sangat ah
uh oh it's a tough one err macam mana eh err
tak I'm sure you like my messina better right
pening seh I tengok
okay to each their own okay to each their own but tom's palette cause they have like local flavours ah macam
macam there's raclette cheese in remember ya that was good ah that's not something that's easily found here
eh but is it because is it because it was very cold over there so macam you know the experience of eating when it's cold and you're lapar like that just makes you feel that it's the best thing ever
borong market okay trying to remember
macam it wasn't it wasn't like popular or macam ya it wasn't like the it wasn't trending yet lah basically
like I remember there was one macam
apa eh flavour ni macam some honeycomb thingy right
pisang goreng is it pisang goreng
macam they said that it was pisang muda goreng or something like that
eh eh mana nak dapat ah
like I remember we came for souvenirs or something else lah like an exhibition or something but we chanced upon the food like the food stalls right ya like we didn't task was really like we didn't even know about the brownie sebelum tu apa
what's dragon's den tak pernah dengar seh
ini macam shark tank ke apa
oh macam like the article like she published or something eh
miss all the good food seh overseas but I miss um ya I miss that we had to be resourceful also overseas macam masak sendiri and all kan
I do I do like macam
apa eh for example prata probably like we would actually
trying to find a prata shop or teh tarik shop and pay an exorbitant amount untuk beli just to macam
just because you were craving and you didn't have it back then kan ya tu ah
entah ah maybe like it's the circumstances that made us miss food and therefore we feel that the food that we had overseas was so much nicer than kat sini
kau singapore pun ada seh
what was so nice about it ah was it like the spices or apa apa yang sedap sangat ah
livable boy sama makan sama hidup eh
sedap kan like apa eh what do we have shepherd's pie ah
and then um ya like we shared quite a bit ah we went there I think malam eh
tu ah tak ingat ah
wah rindu gila seh
um let me see there was very nice milkshake and jacket potatoes kat
sedap kan like
like like I didn't even know something macam so basic and simple can taste so sedap you know what I mean
ya milkshake and skittles and wait apa what was the filling dalam jacket potato dia lupa ah
ya macam I don't think it was tuna what was it ah just like sour cream eh it was ya something like really simple but remember kita order lepas tu kita order lagi lepas tu ya it was that good ah
ya like it's so ya I don't know robably like ya like you said ah before the freshness of the produce and macam ya things are just
so many things to miss about being overseas apa lah yang kita boleh buat kat singapore sekarang
ya lah that one standard ah standby duit jer
macam ya you really save more I mean provided you have the money lah but you really in terms of the price you you do save more and ya I mean people really like to go into stores pasal dia orang suka touch and feel the bags ya the shopping experience err like it's over there it's like
yang unbeatable lah and ya you I think
it's not just one brand tapi macam berlambak ah brand
bukan bicester
okay can you jog my memory again york mana satu
okay lah just want to check it out while we are there betul aqilah
so right what eh did we go to any theme parks ah kat sana like I can't remember like during our trip
ya only only that one err that one place ingat tak tempat tu apa tu nama dia
yang ada the one with the that float what do you call it ah
the one that we sat on the float and then like we slide down the slope apa eh what is it called ah
ya but basically there was that fun huge float kita duduk kat dalam lepas tu we just slide down the slope ya get it is it
ya that was nice and then that was this um eh mahal eh
berapa ah berapa seh
I think kita ada masuk macam some maze thingy right
not not rafting ah lupa ah
oh then kita ada masuk tu haunted house haunted house
kan ada macam tempat I don't know there was this like towards the end of our trip dekat sana then ada this little like haunted house yang kita masuk
kat atas ah like this house of mirrors or something like that
err no ah bondi ah bondi kat australia
cari waterfall ah
cari waterfall we went on a major like waterfall tracking thing in tasmania what
ya it can layer on lagi eh kat dalam forests kena layer on seh
bila seh how come I don't know
ni time uni eh
but err tu ah like last time I never had a chance to travel as a student so like how how different was it travelling like as a student compared to you know when you're working and you have like more money and stuff
like I am sure you had to save up to do certain thing I mean macam you've got to plan around your budget and everything kan
jauh gila eh
eh sabar belgium is germany right
oh okay okay and then apa jadi
so wait the cab fare was mahal gila or what
ish rabak or what
eh wait back then you guys had like phones and technology with you right or macam
ke kau orang macam were I don't know just winging it
ada buffer lah
this was towards the end of your trip or macam mana
wait wait wait wait wait wait at the start of you trip you guys dah takde duit apa seh
oh faham faham K K and then
did the taxi driver actually buy your alasan
ah so like he kena switched on dia punya meter ah
okay okay no lah because I'm just wondering macam you know some places like you have to switch on your meter because like they they need to
confirm tengah panic eh pasal macam dah lah lambat then you have to find your gate and everything like oh my goodness
macam macam what what would err the like significant moments of the trip
oh selamat ah spain menang
imagine if they lost and then their mood will be like habis
people will probably be like maki-maki semua
ya after you spend all your money on a taxi fare confirm ah kena jalan balik kan
serious eh roti and tuna everyday okay I don't think I can do that
prata eh
prata is everywhere
wait wait wait sabar sabar kau orang dah check harga benda tu ke belum
okay okay habis
alright alright alright so you guys were like itik dengan ayam ah berbual
wait wait wait so wait you are saying that means like prata bom ah so kirakan dia ada macam
but as in they served it on the side or memang it's it's really like with the sugar and all
oh my so he gave you guys one first or macam mana
but they didn't sell any plain type just like the the manis one oh okay okay so it's just how they eat it over there lah
so what siesta time basically macam nap time lunch time nap eh
kalau dia orang ada siesta if they had a siesta like will they then open their shops until it after they reopen okay lah then that's not so bad lah
masih ah madrid
he pernah kerja at malaysia or singapore is it
but when you say community do you mean because you were studying at that time right so when you say community do you just mean that it was like the uni like your circle of friends who you met there or community at large macam like you know the muslim probably like the muslim network outside of your studying
oh but how did you find out about your ni the circles outside of your school
ya yang birthday surprise
tak salah pe
I mean like dah dah berbual sampai one one plus
so he and his girlfriend dah kat situ then me and my other guy friend
some Marvel Marvel punya like
uh what else I forgot lah what else ada kat dia punya package yesterday I I read together with them then ya lah
you know like my birthday that time macam
is a company yang buat
so this one we do our own ah like small picnic mat some food very macam
that day punya is not bad cause it's a bit intimate in a way right
so the the the macam deciding factor is
if the birthday boy bawa motor ke tak
and my guy friend ni yang the non-birthday guy
dapat kereta ke tak he can drive what okay our intention is we we we told the girlfriend ah eh like
you you ask him lah go out for once tak yah bawa motor then I say but
because ya he then I say you use lah the excuse kalau pergi Sentosa like
parking mahal then he say but can park at the Seah Seah Im eh he always park there
boleh pass ah
because he did say he did say that uh she did macam bilang dia
my other guy friend cannot get a car kereta bapa dia
what's the plan ah sudah lupa
ah actually if you ask me frankly I prefer kalau pergi Marina Barrage
because dah dekat dengan kedai makan
just just so that macam tak waste time on the road I feel lah
from the other guy he feels that kan macam meriah kalau dalam kereta semua if he tak bawa motor
I I lazy lah go through all that apa monorail eh
okay if we go Sentosa we must start like lepas zohor lah that kind
ya but then he has class ngaji so
ya so need to wait he finish ngaji by the time like two already then nak travel all the way to Sentosa three plus
kita kita nya more like museum attraction kind
uh apa eh
the girlfriend say ah sometimes he like penat from so he
then I'm like kalau he penat like you know
he dah biasa buat
he will always pick up then then we were talking then she was like okay uh apa you wouldn't believe it we wanna go Tampines hub also naik motor
even though it's like dekat gila
no lapan ratus lebih
to naik motor lah so cannot stop him
so if if he still macam go for ngaji then most likely is Marina Barrage ah cause
macam we won't be able to enjoy the attraction as much cause we'll be rushing
dia by six sudah tutup I think
okay the guy wants to get Butter Studio cake he wants to pay so you know let him be biar lah
you know the kedai makan dekat sebelah
I've never eaten there right so I ask him agak agak berapa ah kena bayar like how much is the
korang korang makan apa sia dorang beli banyak ah all guys
then she's like eh then I then I told her lah macam
worse come to worst aku beli air jer ah
then she was like kesiannya datang jauh jauh minum air jer
yeah I mean if there's simple food like nasi goreng mi goreng I'll buy lah
ah like this type ah macam shell out eh I feel
yeah macam I don't
to be very honest right I always dread everytime people ask me out to eat then they ask uh mana kau nak makan ah
point ah I will tell them takut like penuh
uh I did say if we go Sentosa tak ya gi Marina Barrage Vivocity area ada pe then he was like tak nak nak makan restaurant atas sikit
Vivo uh that's what I thought hmm then dorang kata apa nak makan apa Mac then I'm like
kenal us lah cause she knows like
ya and she's not like malu malu dengan kita
she she was the one she was the one who said eh korang nak jumpa for dinner tak a few days ago then I was like
nak discuss about this lah
yeah then I was like masa tu I busy
uh we were in the same class tapi kita ada different clique
ah subset ah dia macam
abeh ada smaller group
hari raya ah hmm
the the guy tak suka the same person I don't like
the other guy also don't like tapi dia pandai bermuka
so sometimes raya also he never come then I a bit sad lah cause like I mean like I close with them what then only me and the other guy ada
ya no loss then he say it's okay uh I will go to your house for raya with the other guy lah just the three of us I'm like okay
ya I think hari raya is the only time that whole big group meet
Arshad say in the group uh apa apa kau kalau tak pergi then kita tak nak pergi ah
just go anyway I also bajet lah I spend
ni nak keluar for the birthday anyway I want to spend money right
I also macam don't feel like how I would feel last time I'll be sad if I never I cannot make it you know
I said that then then the the other girls they alah uh apa you never go then macam boring ah
kalau pergi lima orang then that one person won't have a pair if you take rides
no tak pernah pergi
macam company just another person
tapi three three people is still not bad
I told you what dorang kena kena buang kerja
the blue one the kaki tangling
yesterday ah the girlfriend was telling me kau dah naik yang merah
take lah try taking the apa blue one
this is just before you went umrah
it's just before you went umrah
Aisha aku takut Aisha aku takut
ya I told her that then she's like tak betul lah
oh ya I haven't reply ni
cannot tangguh anymore
semalam oh after we talk about the birthday thing we talk about like other things also lah
then she a bit malu ah and then she was like korang tau eh we we know everything
they uh he saw her in school but he wants to kenal kenal with her right
you know you know the line that guy like uh apa guys like to use or like they ah basically he said uh dia the girl that eh hari tu I saw you at
apa macam like oh bazaar Geylang masa tu bulan puasa
that day I saw you at bazaar ramadhan because he saw the stories lah
padahal he wasn't even there he wasn't even there I saw you at bazaar ramadhan uh wanted to tegur but you look
why what makes you why why do you think he lurus bendul
last time he used to be a bit panas baran if he don't like someone
so that he's not afraid to macam confide to you anytime right
uh are you okay then I'm like off the damn uh apa
tak lah it's a bit it's just like
yeah so dia punya like plastic
it's just a drill dia cakap gitu he would expect something to go wrong on another machine not a drill
no but sec two lower sec uh cannot enter ini kan
I know what is that that one primary school ada
I've never kena detention
I mean almost kena detention I think once
macam so he he walked in front of the discipline master and talk so she won't turn around right
oh I told you Humaira punya story
err finish my practicum yay um I think semalam
cause I macam like you know
true true then macam how to say ah
uh so macam
in a way macam same thing as um
uh so macam meet client then um got assessment then lepas itu
then macam apa itu my office is literally macam just beside the units where they live so macam kalau dia orang nak apa-apa then they will come over knock on the door but it's not twenty four seven lah
ya lah okay lah existing cases tapi macam apa itu
because sekarang macam buat split teams kan then it's like there's two offices we're like we're not supposed to cross then we handle macam cuma two units each lah so kita punya outside unfortunately macam banyak
err like we face shortage of manpower lah macam cause um this the err
cannot remember her title but the my supervisor she's actually she's in charge of two programs lah macam two services so dia kesian gila lah like she has to run back and like she has to toggle between both
and at that time bila phase two right she couldn't meet the other program so she has to run everything at
so uh so then macam then she also has to handle the clients kan the office the the program that I am in and then the other program she err she also has to attend to the matters there lah so macam double work
ah so she kesian ah
then baru sahaja recently another staff left ya cause
it's not pasal itu lah like I think we don't want to take up social work then like there's just no one else to go
but I don't know lah kalau macam
err yesterday I meet up with the um lah then dia tanya I like kalau do you prefer to are you okay to work
she added lah if I want to come to the company and work then macam I don't know what program lah ada satu program ini dia hey just started up their office is in simei which is like great lah macam very near my house
I realised my tempat kerja dan tempat semua macam jauh gila ya
full time lah macam err how to say ah they ask me to apply tapi macam a bit weird lah macam I was telling one of the colleague macam the colleague there lah the staff there there was like
then uh what macam um so weird cause they already asked me a lot of questions and they already know me
and then I think the uh my my um the staff there cakap uh the is the one you are interview lah
then macam like so weird the is actually my technically my supervisor lah then then she on the first day I came in for my macam meet up session dengan dia and my reporting officer
sampai padahal they just want to get to know me better lah
so cute ah then she ask me lah macam like you can go this option this option then apa itu
um then she ask me if I want to continue working lah at the same place yang I buat internship itu then I macam err not sure lah like a bit too far lah but
I guess it makes sense lah for me to macam continue there cause I know the staff there I know like half the clients there
then macam in terms of macam you know blend in with the team gitu like they know it's going to work
I think internally adalah macam issue sikit lah cause dia dah macam cause ada change kan so macam the difference in mm apa power dynamics I guess much macam mm
my the reporting officer she's actually supposed to be macam less
err hands on but I think because of the split teams and everything and then she couldn't meet with the other program kan so macam dia um just suppose head of the homes is actually macam a bit restricted lah
haiya he's like he's the one yang actually main person to do the homes and everything but because um the assistant
ya she's the assistant director then she is there and then macam like dia dah lama dengan kita lah she already do this kind of this job so macam when she comes in and station kan the office gitu kan so err I think he feels a bit restricted lah
ya ya can tell sikit lah
macam I think dia macam like some of the things he didn't agreed with and then macam cause he got his own way of doing things then macam like he doesn't think that we should do this but err in a way
uh then macam like ya then macam at the end of the day macam like I dengar two things ah like I think dia pun macam segan and come up to me and then talk to me about certain things and then I macam uh then macam at the end of the day dia cakap lah like I'm not trying to supervise you
but um this is how it's going to work lah this is how I we used to do it lah so macam I macam caught in tau
so like uh macam am I talking too much
ya macam like this client he came back from hospital then dia pakai taxi then he kept asking lah
lepas itu err I want to
err be refunded by for my cab then apa itu dia cakap
apa itu I put in a group chat lah where everyone can read and then the assistant director said
so then after I uh I got the message then the head of the homes came and then cakap lah like okay this is for to build independence why does he not have enough money to pay for a cab fare then I macam like what what is going on
ya and then macam like it felt weird like macam apa
like dia orang punya procedure in a way like try to solve it internally call
ya so like macam I felt a bit err and then still some more like sometimes
the like I'm macam
I guess macam dia orang treat me a bit like staff there lah which I understand ah macam like
I don't know how they treat their other interns but I think bila yesterday too when I met up with my reporting officer and supervisor she said like I she she thinks that they like I'm treated a bit like staff lah macam they they allow me to do a lot of things
I I felt like macam still terikat lah like if I was the actual staff and case manager like a lot of the things macam I tak check in sangat lah like I would have just check in a bit then I would have run with it lah but macam
uh macam as a intern you realise that what you doing
will have an impact on like the other case workers so macam like I hold back and then like I keep checking in so macam in a way to protect myself and also like to make sure like the client tidak ada
so macam two and a half months actually quite short lah
ada one satu grad dip then the other is I think um under grad but err it's her second practicum
uh so I think this company macam purposely they take up err
they tried to pick up macam grad dip yang pernah kerja
ya ya in the social service sector so that macam mm not train lah macam like you know uh
work etiquette ah work etiquette macam like organisation after awhile macam a lot of organization macam structured a certain way
and then macam there's like cause I know lah macam like there's policy there's guidelines macam there's to meet gitu so macam like I roughly know lah
ya so I kind of know lah punya mentality where they go they a bit
they are a bit macam
jaga muka jaga face sikit like macam they expect
I guess like macam when you work with people it's not easy to see a change very fast kan ya so macam some of them macam resistant some of them macam they are forced to go into the service because of what they they did are like
or macam the society or the community macam thinks of them that that there's an issue with them so they report lah to government or which is lah can trickle down to usually lah cause they always report to lah
so then anything raise up lah then blah blah blah nanti in the end turun to the organisation so then they expect organisation
so macam be miracle lah miracle workers then kita cakap dengan dia orang lah it's not possible they don't see it as a problem you see it as a problem and most of the time dia orang pun tak nak someone to come in and interfere with their private affairs
and then macam how to say
dia orang punya is a bit merepek lah at times I feel
cannot be that macam one case worker has to hold maybe around
err I think last time apa eh eighty cases
ya actually ya actually initially they wanted according to my reporting officer lah they wanted I think hundred I was like kalau hundred one case sahaja can be like besar gila because of their complications is are they
someone who is very minimal macam susah gila it's because like it comes and goes ah each person kadang-kadang this period they are okay some periods not and then also macam seasonal you see cause sometimes like
I I think depending on the timing like macam chinese new year or christmas timing right they will there's like explosion of things going on cause macam I think macam
how to say macam it ties into their
so dia teringat-ingat the families ah or what how is your relationship with their family lah that kind of thing
you ketawa
for like uh macam reporting period lah ya then macam
but I think macam they try to push lah macam reduce the amount first of all and then second it cannot be that macam is singular case work lah it must macam kita buat group work or something considered under the lah because macam
it's try lah they try to lah maximum I think thirty to forty lah but then nowadays ah cases macam complicated you the person itself is not alone kan then you have to look at the family like the community setting
so macam orang dekat atas tak faham orang dekat bawah
and apa
I might lah I I will I will look through the simei one is a new program it it seems like macam um a a duplication of some of their services so macam like
I ask them ah what is it about this new program that you want to start uh new siting cause macam I think they try to ask different people to build up the team from like previously the different programs lah
err I think the cases all the cases in the east to be transferred lah so then what's the macam main difference lah between the other programs
so it doesn't ya it still sounds very um macam apa exploratory
oh no no there's no need to itu I have to I apply the usual route lah
macam I'm not in the headspace to cari kerja sekarang
I don't know if I want to just continue doing my masters ke tak next year is like I I feel macam
it's not that lah I macam don't know where to go yet I don't know if macam is the place for me to do masters like macam after one year one point five years of doing grad dip kan macam like
is it a good place to start like to study lah macam their profs are good and everything but macam ada I don't know lah what I want to take up the extra curricular modules and then if I want to take up continuing masters in social work
uh I think I macam orang gatal sikit macam I cannot
think what about your current job yang yang part time how is it so far
so you have to be firm and you have to macam how to say
approachable macam like you don't be the too nice person is usually is all strict first
then afterwards macam like then they say you strict right then they respect then you come in and be nice
it's the little things lah you cannot macam force your way into it like macam like
whatever you say you keep to it then they will respect you even macam as young as two they will remember especially kids ah they will remember
alamak teruk lah ya
I don't know I I want to do it that time then I think I had to cancel my appointment cause siapa eh can't remember so I had it was a a clash then I tried to reschedule then after that circuit breaker then my mum pernah buat ya ya actually I want she okay sahaja
but I I tak
so I wanted to go again then I terlupa then a lot of things happen kan then ya you know orh this year is like a very um happening year for me
on monday tapi dekat mana
tempat itu jauh jauh seh for me
is it not the darah one right
ya my mum advised me to go for the darah one cause apa itu
ya so she asked me to go for the darah one she went for the darah one also actually
you my apa eh
I can't remember what my mum told me tapi dia cakap macam you can you kalau nak ikut sunnah itu you follow which day eh
no monday ke thursday tak ingat but definitely not friday ya
ah but she went for it but macam yang this one this lady dia buat itu the female one she she she lives in tampines ah then she she part time major
think ya ya buat dekat rumah dia
I tak ingat err
I book I book the itu then I
macam normal lah tak won't break your bank kind of situation lah
uh no my mum okay sahaja lepas bekam
at least you don't transcribe yourself I I was apa itu part of my assignment one of it is macam to do process recordings lah then I kena record myself with a conversation with a client
it was so cringey then I heard myself cause it's macam I pakai mask kan and then I have to macam analyse lah everything that I do with the client then I was like so uh I hate this I hate this like interview so long thirty plus
ya I know I think ya I think when I heard my uh voice macam like apa itu macam way lower then macam
uh macam
the normal normal high pitch I think I realised my voice is the lower register and then macam calm like more huh not calmer lah macam
then will be like kenapa hujan siapa nyanyi
mm no ah it just sounds normal to me ya I I don't know lah macam ada ya
I think I don't know lah macam something to do with our ears like usually when we
voice macam I think it's the um channel that they go into so macam when we hear our voices during our
apa itu using recording ke apa right ya it sounds weird net factor
can't imagine we apa itu sekarang what maybe they gonna do some space travel kan tak sampai ingat who is it ah the guy yang faizal tak suka itu no
okay okay can lah I don't mind cause technically macam it's either
macam no err no macam
parkway parade or like you know north east region gitu
actually macam ya in terms of connectivity macam cycling I think in the east is better
eh there is a dekat tampines there's a eco green park town
eh I is this the guy yang you were the one that ya the one that you macam not certain is it this one
ya lah it makes more sense lah habis itu ya
then sometime macam like kalau the girl moves into the guy's house is sometimes macam
uh ada lah fiction you pernah dengar
outside you and the mother-in-law macam okay lah bermesra gitu but
I think macam like entah what would what would I know also
tak macam ada like female macam ada expectations on us like we should tak kisah lah kalau you kerja full time couple like you're supposed to help out
at the house then macam like the opposite doesn't hold true if like the guy moves into the house like you still have
mm like macam apa itu
like you don't expect the husband to like do so much of like housework or anything is macam financially sahaja lah kasih duit
but nowadays is like susah lah nak
I know which is like macam a bit worrying lah macam I think I tengah fikir-fikir because macam
like I also don't want to send like any potential kids to infant care or childcare cause macam at the end of the day the kids how they turn out is supposed to be your responsibility kan but then also
like you shouldn't segan and not ask for help and then my mm then my parents dia orang tak nak macam they want to have their own lives lah they don't want to be like you know
it's like the only other options I can see is that I macam berhenti kerja sekejap lah jaga anak and then ya and then potentially you lose
uh apa itu credibility um relevancy to the the area that you are in then susah balik nak masuk kerja
so then also like your is lower then you basically rely on your husband ah and then macam a lot of people tell me lah macam oh what uh don't rely so much on your husband try to be independent macam like what is going on
ya but at the end of the day macam but if you is good lah kalau you only want to have like one kid sahaja but then kalau you want anak kedua ketiga then when is it going to stop
ya so macam
technically kalau nak masuk playgroup lah it's a nice timing to masuk balik kerja and then
I don't know lah macam singapore punya culture not flexible yet
so macam
number one err it was very easy and simple for me to just ask about his name and full name it wasn't very macam like uh abang why you asking for my name no ah upfront telling and then even talking about his job he just explain that he used to he is in the police force and then he used to work in err
that's why lah but of course there's that connotation lah kan tapi it's not it's not really
so ah dia suka dia suka in the couch we are all sitting at the couch I was sitting at this side of the couch
he was sitting here abah was sitting at a chair that I brought for him I got zina to sit right beside me
ah that one I didn't get to ask but that one is tak tak important lah ya
so the other ah important part was about his job experience lah so he did confirm his five years then I ask him can you explain to me what how did he get to five years then he explain lah actually he was doing national service but he was waiting for he apa the the sign on agreement and it it it only came after and also that's how he got disrupted he had to go through the whole process at police again
this boy being very upfront helps the situation so that's why me and abah were very calm about it tak ada macam problematic so I spoke to them about the video thing I spoke to them that eh
ah so he told they he explain they both okay the reason why they rush for it was ah number one ah apa there was this timeline that they wanted to apply because if they don't apply they wouldn't get it at the place that they are looking for which is near their near his parents' place and then dia tinggal pasir ris
so at the end they they actually end up they they have to look for something that is resale lah because they want to look for some a place near err istighfar
because dekat um the parents place pasir ris
this is this could have been boleh fikirkan cara yang lebih baik lah kan which is to
bilang kan that you want to um do this to both your parents and zina's parents inform before you go on to doing that because what if you get that err the keys you know then what you have to actually this part abah was the one who ah already point out I just reiterated the point
nanti kan macam terdesak kan you have to like actually have to push for this ah then you are making it difficult for both sides
ah then he just he just nodded lah he he understood uh but I was still macam thinking eh do you are you apologetic or not about your your mistake here ah but I think it's in between lah it's in between that apologetic but also macam like okay
so his from his stand is like no harm no foul can cancel what begitu I say it's not about that lah it's about you informing do it properly
ah then I then I also talk to them lah like okay want then I want to hear what is his plan abah also want to hear what is his apa dia punya rancangan lah
um then it was very clear rancangan is that
the next year somewhere dalam march they intend to tunang dengan zina
the guy was saying ya so there's that and then probably meeting up the parents that means his parents to come and meet abah probably in december so that they give them some at least a few months before the engagement lah
the nikah would be in twenty twenty two end of twenty twenty two
at least ada
ah then okay then at least say that gives proper time lah for you to both look at how you gonna plan this then I say then the abah was saying you know zina just got
err just finish studying jadi apa the plan in these two years for for her uh then this azram cakap oh ya uh this is to would be
ya because he and then he explained it before before I even need to talk about macam like the financial burden because he said ya definitely it's not enough just for me zina also needs to work to build up a
that's why it's very easy because he seems to know the have a plan and he seems to okay so that's why macam it was a easy session because he was very clear and very direct and it was simple tak payah tak ada complication
and I and I pun cakap dengan dia lah that
you nak kena
dia zina pun nak kena grow up
asing asing asing masing-masing kena grow up tersendiri
ah so you need give that time untuk you both nak kena grow up ah that's the thing budak itu diam jer so I tak puas hati because like you can just be numb about this whole thing lah that is a which is uh quite good as you're gonna either you don't absorb or you not receiving or you rejecting so many things that can happen right just because you're keeping quiet so after that abah is there something you want to uh anything you want to ask them uh I said ya so ah let me check in um so
so one thing that I brought out is you both nak kena
tersendiri grow
memang ah nak kena apa ada this uh
grow up right memang nak kena ada grow up tapi uh growing up needs to needs perlu berada dalam
ah context apa
maksud dia has to grow up both growing up can take place both as a single and as a married couple
a bit a bit like that but also but also he's trying that uh growing up takes place both lah during single and when you get married so I said then okay then the next thing is for you guys to set out a plan on how you gonna go about this ah so I made it very clear that don't just lip service dia perlu perbincangan further you guys need to communicate I told them you guys need to communicate this further need to talk about how you gonna plan this out and then when I say communicate abah dengar ini tak mahu communicate communicate like tak boleh nak jumpa jumpa abah there's nothing wrong with communicate I said so um I think they got it lah so now it's about them solidifying this by putting out a plan
kau orang nak kena sit down nak kena plan out how to grow individually and then after that plan out how to grow together then this will work if you just gonna say ah ya lah grow grow grow but you just gonna
tak work on it you just gonna macam letak kat tepi jer and just macam put it into the back of your mind tak nak macam
apa buat kerja develop this it's not gonna work
of course I'm not macam blind to this ah
because at the end itu mama dekat kitchen and mm mama malu malu lah apa lah nanti bila kita duduk makan baru mama duduk
dayah tak ada dayah said she doesn't want to be there also lah
I didn't say sembunyi-sembunyi lah I say you have to be upfront you cannot you cannot you know be quiet about things you have to inform
body gesture and how he interact with zina he is very firm he's just firm lah it's that not say very firm lah but it's firm macam whatever zina macam nak nak tanya ah ashraf right do you want water then he will just say
very macam he won't just he won't say oh it's okay zina he he won't
so I can see ah and the way he speaks also is macam very direct and very
ya so it's not macam so as as ambiguous as it was lah at least it's kind of macam very clear at least they have a plan at least they are aware that they need to ah give zina time to work ah give zina time to develop
kita tak tanya pasal dia punya family ya I did so his father is is working as a relief taxi driver mum is not working
changi business apa changi ah ya that one ya that one warehouse lah ya so
dia macam ya macam I I don't know that
so jadi macam
then abah abah is the kind where if he's
interested in someone he will have lengthy conversations and then after that abah like talk about so many things from people to world views to politics
ya no can see that okay abah is comfortable with him already
ah that's something that they will have to macam resolve lah how but at the very least they are giving zina time to grow
and then ya like I said I got the full name got the wage it's been ah apa been attached to for the three months
ah it was okay normal not not that macam overly zealous also like
ya he was also upfront say that ah the past uh he has yet to have the chance to go for jumaat players
ever since COVID like macam basically he's just trying to share lah like you know it this is the situation for him also cause we were talking about this
the the we were talking about it wasn't like macam he just brought up we were talking about jumaat prayers and then we were sharing
ya tak payah macam pening-pening sangat
ah actually after that was a lot more interest lepas itu lagi interesting
was abah sudah sekarang tengah fikir ah ini sekarang nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah
ashraf sudah balik semua sudah balik ah ah lepas itu abah cakap nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah asyik
tolak tolak tolak semua budak ini yang terkena kan then I said abah
abah nak kena tengok eh
hidayah okay you you got two different daughters abah cakap apa different both are daughter yes both are your daughters tapi there are two different girls two different daughters
zina is on the receiving end she is zina sudah memang nak menerima
apa berkahwin hidayah I don't think she is there yet dayah belum lagi ke tahap itu
then zina pun add in ah ya but she says she wants to get married ya memang dia nak tapi is she proactive looking no what she is not if she proactive looking she would have brought up some suitors uh
then uh then I said so abah you need to understand yang ini dua anak perempuan berlainan
so abah kena recognize that and dayah is happy at where she is right now in her life okay and then I say abah macam habis kita then I say okay yes I know I I faham abah tengah risau habis macam mana now bila habis sampai bila abah kata
then abah let me give you some advice
if you nak di to even
abah err mama bila nak
calonkan or menunjukkan calon
biar quality
biar berkualiti orang orang yang abah dan mama tunjukkan semua tak ada quality dayah sendiri sudah pergi selidik of course sudah sekali dua kali sudah kena mesti dia sudah macam give up dengan mama abah punya ini pasal mama abah just throw jer ya then mama say tapi the one yang dekat australia itu abah mama tahu tak he is just a taxi driver then dayah will think macam macam bingit lah
because he actually err apa he has worked for many years and he doesn't want to work anymore so he with all the wealth he accumulated he bought a house and he started to sewakan rumah ini so his earnings from the rental ya but the point is
itu lah yang aku cakap
that's why I say cari orang berkualiti berkualiti is not just about
ya so anyway jadi macam
abah understood that lah I said abah tak boleh control apa dayah nak ini
abah boleh control kalau abah nak sangat carikan calon abah boleh control itu itu yang abah boleh control
so I said right now it seem that dayah memang belum lagi bersedia kalau abah nak carikan fine tapi cari berkualiti this if people are not are ada quality and I said pada abah it's not about social status it's not about macam kaya tak kaya ya it's about the dia nak kena match ah
jadi budak ini dengan dayah are two different people so cannot
then membina diri sendiri eh macam mana
ah lepas itu baru boleh fikir macam mana nak bina
tak boleh zina cakap ah ya ya okay I will look at it lah abang ya
dia cakap abang lah okay
he ya of course then he cause he come down like first he I said oh I got to know I started off the conversation with him I got to know uh semalam that err you you are ashraf then I was thinking okay how is it macam mana dia akan menerima ini ah cara eh
zina selama ini tak kenalkan aku like
nama pun tak tahu semalam baru dapat tahu nama I don't know lah but then lepas itu dia tanya err abang your name is salim is it ah yes
ya he was very comfortable and just calling me abang ah like if macam dia satay ada banyak ya then abang also can bring back the
so I thought err ya that's why it was easy lah macam abang pun cakap and because like I said
I told ashraf that I'm appreciative yang dia terus terang dia
ada apa ada wawasan lah ah
lepas itu abang pun cakap ah yang kalau ashraf datang habis tak tak apa tak clear ah habis suka nak kelentong-kelentong ini
encik pun tak nak tak nak cakap cakap dengan ashraf ini ah
okay lah I thought macam the
macam mana it went through was good lah ya
ah azlina azlina need to macam grow up lah on this
because I I'm trying to point to our since you admire so much this person and you're macam like then at least pick up the good attributes that he has lah correct or not if you cannot pick it up from me then pick it up from someone else whatever just pick it up I said I said just pick it up what ashraf has did did you see or not how ashraf did it
so simple right he just be straightforward be upfront tak ada nak sembunyi-sembunyi
kan daddy cerita senang then I say isn't it simple so that macam orang tak curiga orang tak terfikir-fikir orang tak keliru
ah you just have to be upfront jer kan senang and ya lah ya ya you need to wake up okay you need to wake up and see how to address this
aku cakap dengan dia yang easy-going dengan being firm
during the discussion dengan ashraf I was saying zina
didn't have any plan you know what to do with her life I have been the one to guide her in what to study mm ah ashraf dengar jer lah what he want to say he just mm mm
mm but whatever it is he is already macam he never macam like show the reaction of macam you know or he didn't show it lah of being tak nak tak nak apa oh like shock or what I think he knows ah what he's getting into with zina
ya lah I agree of course that's why I said they both tersendiri nak kena grow and learn on what they need to grow about and then grow together only after the growing indeed tersendiri
if if kalau izat buat gitu then I will tell him off lah eh kau kenal dia ke tak kan kalau kita tak buat ini kita tak tahu apa so we have to be we have to take this step kita kena uh apa kita mesti
ambil uh
kegiatan begini ah tak boleh macam ah
tak boleh macam apa ambil scenario jer
I faham
no lah dia tak boleh terus macam lepaskan tangan no
I was two zero abah open this topic about dayah then I was asking zina zina what have you been talking to dayah lah about dayah's like err relationship or a'ah zina cakap no we don't talk each other huh
sekarang dua-dua sudah try kan
dua-dua sudah try
tak boleh kan so you tell me apa nak kena buat sekarang
nak buat apa sekarang then dia sudah ah ya try again lah try no
sudah try sudah sekarang kan tak boleh kan so nak kena buat apa
do what you want me to tell you the answer takkan lah I have to give you the answer
why you must have the jawapan for me
I want to hear from your own mulut
and then dia cakap ya then kita nak kena ask someone to help ah then siapa this someone to help
kenapa it has to be me to ask you to
you know abang salim kita ada problem
okay just kind of macam jumpa
see things eye to eye tak boleh macam bersefahaman
and we just cannot talk about personal things let's say ya do you know why zina kalau if this were the reverse that let's say you and zina you and dayah
macam mana pun that has happen ah izat would still come and apologize to me
then you did zina was saying macam like ya but you guys don't talk about personal no I talk about personal things to izat
macam like life lah about children about
apa marriage like that that
lah macam ya lah macam like how how he uh apa decided to get married with with salimah then ya we have ya before even during during apa
during ah our apa being after being married also we still talk about macam certain thing we don't talk about jobs we are not macam pen pals is not like macam like the way I would talk to faris for example but
macam at least macam things things about personal things I still can talk to him macam I can easily talk to him macam eh izat kau tengok macam ah macam dayah is like I I can have the conversation with izat you know ya I can but macam
dayah and zina will not be able to talk about anything personal they will just talk about things that macam
no lah not really enstranged like even after this one I I have macam move on and forgive him already like whatever he needs to work on it he knows that he needs to work on it it's it's a long working it's a long working process for him at the very least now he can learn to apologise dulu lagi tak boleh apologise pun dia punya ego is so big
I know that if I meet him the next time he will actually still come and say apologize to me just to macam make sure that we are in good terms because at least he wants to proactively want us to be in good terms hidayah and zina is different they are just happy with being ignored
dayah zina sudah give up with this thing where she would just be happy with ignoring hidiyah
that's how bad it is ah so at least me and izat kalau kita disagree but we will want to still talk about it we won't like ignore it like izat macam has a very strong point he will still want to talk about it like this thing that macam he feels very strongly that I'm going to be very aggressive he will still talk about it what he will not macam um tak nak berbual dengan si salim no he still at least wants to talk about it so at least that's healthy enough
how he macam best character he needs to learn to work it out
kita semua memang have your own areas of growth but
dayah and zina is like they just ignore the problem then I say zina especially now when you are about to get married what do you think would happen nanti bil zina sudah kahwin zina sudah pergi tinggal tempat lain lagi kan lagi kau orang lagi will be more separated
you and dayah ready have a problem bila kau orang tak sama rumah lagi what do you think
this passive aggressiveness tak boleh tak boleh ah
and not just macam like ah tak apa no it's not tak apa
ya I I did I did macam tell her lah that at the end of the day we are all family and I also did tell her that uh
you nak kena
fikir how
this is important this memang mustahak
you cannot just macam biarkan that this issue err to just continue as it is because it's not gonna be healthy
ah first you have to you setuju if you setuju
you want me to help okay then that's enough for your side I will ask hidayah tanya hidayah kalau hidayah nak then
jadi it's just that simple
both first of all the plan is get both of them to a room sit down talk about their trust issues that they have for each other the biggest problem masalah yang dia ada ini is trust issues hidayah doesn't trust her because hidayah feels that she is very incompetent still very childish and what what what what still haven't gone through life experience about what zina has trust issues because things dayah is no no it all dismiss I'm better than you ah so that's why lah trust issues you issue you don't trust each other's number one you don't trust each other in terms of feelings you don't trust each other about your thoughts ah so that is the the issue here then it will manifest to every other thing isn't it
tak boleh ah it's just not healthy and you cannot just
biarkan macam gitu jer
mama abah just listen so good thing was
mama abah willing to hear
mm kenapa
zina was uh no I uh zina was saying that she was um the reason why apa she went on to telling izat first because she felt more comfortable talking to izat
then she she sudah bingit lah bila kena rubbish then she walk off
she she kena already lah then she walk off
then say ya of recent years it has been the case ah that's that's the part I said ah rubbish then stop it since when then she already sudah kena then she walk off to toilet
because like ya she had to hear it lah macam like eh mana wah you are the
so going back to yang tadi kan we were talking about zina and dayah and I was asking zina who do you think you
jadi sebab dia kena tengok and understand that this is the situation
and zina sit down together then they can iron this out lah macam
they just don't see the point in macam making sure that they are
true lah dia tak boleh macam just simply you know say that oh this is a one time deal mesti lah dia ingat
ya so obviously it takes steps lah it's not macam I one time can boleh boleh
orang kaya kan bagus nak jadi nak jadi kaya-raya
boleh tolong mak bapa sekarang kan pembelanjaan kan banyak that's why I need a lot of money lah and
furthermore now my age is already dah tiga puluh lebih tahun
so I will need the income the additional money to support my mum lah and my dad ni semua
oh ya lagi dua wish okay lagi dua wish is mula-mula nak jadi orang kaya selepas tu nak jadi orang yang kurus
cause I am right now I'm my weight is about one one two so I'm quite fat lah and dulu-dulu kan I was actually um eighty kilo only I was quite fit lah go to gym one week four times
per day I mean four times a week I do all kinds of exercise even at one point in time I even had a abs lah kirakan dua pack ke
empat pack punya abs lah kirakan dah tu I also last time belajar karate judo belajar mixed martial arts semua
cuma sekarang jer lah dah apa tu dah kerja kan jadi pun dah malas
um lepas kaya sihat okay err since my age now is tiga puluh dua tahun I'm just waiting for three more years lah then I wish that I can buy my own I don't want to buy private cause the maintenance tinggi sangat
so I just want to buy itu pun kalau boleh empat bilik lima bilik ataupun masionette lah mana yang I mampu why
cause kalau beli rumah besar sikit boleh rental income so I can meet one of the agent yang I kenal which is my friend lah
ask them for advice so they can help me lah um tolong cari kalau boleh pun nak nak beli rumah dekat-dekat dengan hospital ataupun dekat-dekat dengan any healthcare punya tempat macam polyclinic or what why
cause kalau kita pindah dekat situ I mean kalau kita ada rumah kat situ
kita boleh rental kan rumah dengan nurse nurse lah lagipun nurse gaji kan okay boleh tahan so kirakan kita boleh earn quite a lot from that rental income ah kirakan ah itu saja lah yang my three wishes lah very realistic punya wish ah cause kalau kita wish merepek pun I mean uh bukannya boleh mencapai kan so I will always wish on things that I can achieve I can confirm I can achieve
okay lah kalau if I have any superpowers out of the three right
hmm superpowers eh err superpowers what are the three eh apa best eh mm
tengok gambar avengers
superpowers ah jadi thor ah
thor best ah thor thor is the god of thunder dia boleh pergi to a different realm boleh pergi space boleh pergi sana sini
thor pun kuat kan dia punya ada hammer dia lah hammer ada dua macam macam hammer lah
abeh lepas tu dia boleh pergi mana dia nak pergi he's the strongest ah actually but then there's also another one strongest which is also my choice is a
captain marvel I know that captain marvel is a lady lah but uh actually kalau you can make it into a man punya character pun bagus juga
so it's basically the strongest avengers in all the avengers even thanos pun kalah okay there's one more is I like to be the witch ah a witch
from also from avengers kenapa
cause yang time kita tengok end games tu actually kalau
thanos dia tak panggil ah apa tu dengan dia punya kuncu-kuncu dia who make it link it's actually witch tu witch tu yang akan kalahkan dia lah cause he's already
on the verge of losing bila bila kalah rabak ah but then cause he asked the dia punya kuncu-kuncu dia untuk bring down the ring
so all the yang spaceship besar punya cannon tu kena tembak jer rabak ah kena that's the three superhero that I want
hulk no cause hulk dia besar sangat actually kalau tinggal dekat singapore nak jadi hulk aduh
sebab tu kat singapore kalau nak beli kereta pun jangan beli kereta besar beli kereta kecil sudah kalau beli kereta besar kereta punya parking pun bukannya besar-besar pun
yang parking lama lagi halus-halus jer nak pergi sana sini aduh nak belok jer nak u-turn jer leceh
kita punya roads actually very very small so it's the best kalau
even your body jangan lah jadi macam bodybuilder have a small physique lah kirakan angan badan besar-besar sangat
meal tu apa makan apa-apa ah
ah until now I pernah makan
itu that is very memorable apasal
itu whale meat yang paling mahal sekali
actually dia punya whale meat dia dia potong kecil-kecil tipis-tipis jer dia potong
lepas tu dia suruh kita makan dengan ramen ramen
dia punya japanese version punya ramen lah then kita makan
selepas tu first I thought macam dia punya dia punya portion dia is quite big tau besar tapi sikit sikit nah dia kasih too little
oh it's cooked it's cooked I know it's cooked cause uh it's not sashimi usually orang jepun kalau kasih sashimi dia akan letak dekat a different plate
but this one is cooked uh but not like deep fry punya cook lah macam I think steam or what lah cause
dia letak on top of the ramen itself so we must eat along on the ramen dengan dia punya
condiments ah basically dengan dia punya seaweed semua lah
ya that is actually it's not the nicest food that I've eaten but it is actually um the most unique lah paling unique sekali and dia punya
restaurant is actually located outside meiji shrine ah yang pasal halal
tak halal tu actually I got one guy friend who actually he checked the stall and one good thing about japanese punya
restaurant kan once they sell the seafood they won't sell anything else macam
babi or any uh meat stuff lah even ayam ke daging ke apa so once they sell barang
seafood is purely hundred percent just barang seafood jer
okay okay yang itu paling best okay yang dia punya whale bila makan it's eh dia punya potong slice very thin and small so when I I just cut bits by bits then every little bits
lah put inside my mouth it just melts dia kira macam makan butter gitu cuma rasa dia is bukan butter rasa dia is lemak tapi bukan lemak macam
kambing ke lemak ah no tau it's just lemak
but you just taste the sea water so kirakan
lemak ikan and whale punya lemak is really one of a kind ah it's really wah if
kalau awak pernah makan macam sea urchin ke apa ah macam gitu I already eaten a sea urchin before also
and to me it's quite common but the whale meat the whale fats on meat itu itu yang very very very unique
ah tak pasti isi or fats
but uh mostly it's I think fats ah cause kalau isi whale kan is a tough kan
so it won't melt in your mouth but mostly if it's the fats of the whale any fats yang kita makan masuk dalam mulut even fats kambing
ke lembu ke apa masuk dalam mulut mesti melts in the mouth
ah so that is the thing and lagipun dia punya I think dia potong tipis-tipis lah so I can't really
actually takde yang okay compare japan korea lah kita jangan cakap pasal thailand
thailand is dia punya makan just semuanya pedas-pedas jer
uh japan boleh tahan uh but japan punya makan is betul-betul
yang betul-betul tekak orang melayu is you know what um makanan korea
cause makanan korea even dia punya mee hitam tu yang
orang tengok tak sedap tapi orang cakap makan sedap yang mee hitam tu dia punya rasa exactly the same as kita punya mee rebus
yes jajangmyeon cause kita punya mee rebus semua the difference is jajangmyeon is macam dia macam basah-basah
dia tak ada kuah tapi kita mee rebus ada kuah tapi dia punya rasa exactly the same macam kita punya mee rebus punya kuah and of course kita punya mee rebus lagi sedap cause why kita punya mee rebus kita ada letak limau kasturi
and ada telur ada apa so dia orang punya is a mixture of japanese
punya taste bud dengan mix with into mee rebus punya rasa that's what I think
for korean dishes that is quite unique lah quite unique tapi yang I really like about korea is dia punya daging bulgogi
itu I can eat everyday I can eat breakfast lunch dinner dia punya daging bulgogi dia makan dengan nasi panas-panas enough ialah cukup
cause pasal pasal daging bulgogi dia is macam makan daging dendeng tapi daging dendeng dia berminyak sangat tapi itu bulgogi tu you imagine macam daging dendeng cuma dah hancur-hancurkan
they shred into pieces and actually they cook in a hotplate fuh lepas tu makan dengan nasi
nasi biasa nasi panas-panas eh steam rice ke apa
sedap you can eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner you can eat it everyday
you takkan rasa jelak I mean according to my taste lah cause I really like the daging bulgogi
yes I've tried wagyu beef yang halal punya actually we have
until apa tu um A three ke A two usually halal punya wagyu beef there's no A five yang tak halal punya iya yang A five cause um
yang halal punya is actually err it's only made in australia
yang the non-halal one is all made in originally from japan itself lah yang halal punya is only made in australia and australia usually their A is they can't reach the A five punya punya apa tu punya punya grading
the the wagyu beef is actually made in japan cause there is this certain part of japan yang yang ah
the essence of wagyu beef ah yang banyak marbling it's also I heard there's also a
for the wagyu beef punya itu ah market
so only in japan then you get the really the grade A five yang paling tinggi punya yang paling mahal punya the rest of it is a usually um
tak uh no
the rest of it is always comes from australia australia punya is uh dia punya grade not that high lah but dia punya rasa okay lah actually okay lah the thing about
uh wagyu beef is just that dia punya lemak jer
yang if you if you really notice kan dia punya yang urat-urat tu is actually fats
so even the the normal fats the lemak fats is the same
what makes it different is that orang jepun ni dia punya wagyu beef dia suka potong raw
makan macam apa tu the sashimi eh then they cut raw slice very thin pieces then what they want is that umami effect basically once you cut thin pieces you put it in your mouth it melts then
ada itu umami punya effect umami effect is exactly like how you
eat macam uh apa tu
ajinomoto dia that that kind of effect that kind of taste that's what they chase for the wagyu beef
uh dia punya lemak-lemak dia
oh like I say just now lah I only eat bulgogi cause that's to me is the best of the best paling sedap
the bulgogi is really my got to lah I've eaten orang makan thailand makan indonesia melayu semua I just like bulgogi cause bulgogi pun kira macam-macam tau a different part of korea yang halal punya they make different type of bulgogi the one that I really like is the budak-budak yang bikin kat
that hill daripada bawah sampai kat atas semua
makanan halal from singapore from malaysia
turkey negeri arab semua ada so at the top of the hill is actually a mosque nama dia
oh tak apa-apa nama dia is is not it's a adalah I kind of forgotten the name of the mosque
okay cause dia pun macam road kan so you go down on the other side you go down a bit
you will find this small macam
err macam mana eh you know like those kind of arab street punya shophouses you go ah
macam gitu you go then adalah dekat situ ah actually yang masaknya budak-budak perempuan melayu
a lot of them and also there are other specialty kan it's actually ayam rebus and dia punya ayam it's actually they take the whole
macam spring chicken dia kasih steam itu benda
and dia rebus kat dalam the chicken soup the chicken broth wah then they they just ah basically
dia tak potong tak apa the steamed chicken tu they just give you in a big pot then they give you a one
ah apa tu one bowl of rice
fuh makan sedap ah actually during winter makan tu is the best ah
not really winter lah it's quite cold but not really winter yang I went to japan is I went there when it was winter and in japan
dalam minus
twelve ah minus twelve yang paling sejuk ah lepas tu yang paling best kan kat japan on the new year's day new year's day pagi-pagi bangun
from the apartment I play with the snow for I mean dia punya snow dia punya snow is tak banyak must wait for the night time then we go to the
ah kalau you go cause tokyo kan is bandar kan so all the snow will melt in the concrete so basically you need to go to the park then
the snow will be at you know at the fields dekat yang pokok-pokok ah then you can take the snow from there
err truthfully okay for long term wise I prefer singapore punya weather cause singapore punya weather you can only expect two
punya weather lah like uh autumn
uh apa tu spring lah winter
livelihood lah I mean tengok kita tinggal dekat rumah berapa besar lah rumah kita then lepas tu kita punya kain baju untuk weather singapore sendiri dah
dah banyak apa lagi kalau imagine kita kena simpan for
winter clothings lain
autumn clothings lain
spring clothings lain summer clothings lain so we will ah take up more space and for a small country like singapore with our small houses right I don't think that's ideal lah that is for me lah but unless it's ah you are
talking about we are living in japan negeri dia besar even in japan when I went there I actually I checked out the houses there dia punya rumah sana
murah-murah and actually it's freehold tau it's not macam kita lease
ninety nine years is freehold rumah dia is actually very affordable
kita punya rumah three room you can buy a very big bungalow sized punya rumah in japan freehold
punya scenery cause japan is very mountainous
so I've been to the neighbourhood area macam kita punya
tempat lah hougang ang mo kio
kita punya you turn left you turn right all you see are flats right kalau dekat jepun you go to that kind of a
urban area it's not really urban ah it's macam dia punya heartland ah kira
is all rumah dia is all uh rumah bungalow bungalow bungalow
lepas tu yang ada tempat ada gate yang ada tempat tak ada gate but mostly tempat dia orang is there's no gate so their communals spirit is very strong and in
dia punya village dia is actually a farm
dia akan farm is actually itu farm dia uh jepun punya beras kan lain kan so basically all the villagers dia akan um
apa tu have this small mini farms that is actually when I asked the people there they say by right throughout history right that small farm is enough to
to sustain the whole village by right ah until modernization come lah but that farm itself right untuk kalau
nasi basic punya nasi is actually more than enough to feed the whole
so even until now also there are still people but not young people lah the old people ah dia orang tua-tua yang ah mend
the small farms in japan so basically when they mend the small farms right um yang paling best kita orang tourist they let they let us enter
cause dia orang yang kalau boleh berbual bahasa jepun
dia orang will be more receptive than people who can't speak japanese
can't speak japanese you can only speak english yang
the older generation so only younger generation can speak english but their english pun is actually
broken english it's not really full uh punya english the language that we learn um from our
oh budak-budak singapore kita punya english is one of the highest grade lah kirakan kita yang paling pandai dalam bahasa english in all of asian punya country even if you go to like
russia even china you know apatah lagi malaysia indonesia ni semua their english level dengan budak singapore punya level
is really macam langit dengan bumi lain
oh tak for japan tak uh it depends on where you go kalau itu tempat is betul-betul hundred percent muslims okay usually macam gini even if you go
to any other country macam thailand even bali or what kan kalau if you go to a halal restaurant
there is owned by indians or arabs yes they will have a dua dapur
one dapur is for the halal the other dapur is actually is for their alcohol
beverages so they ada dua dapur for those pure
muslims usually yang macam if you go japan is those
orang kita cakap mualaf ah orang jepun mualaf ke apa ah they are muslims born and bred muslims in japan they will have hundred percent halal then they have the dia punya sign is also not the normal halal sign it's from actually kalau macam kita punya singapore ada MUIS
ah so they also have their own punya MUIS lah dekat in japan so basically even for korea also the same thing
for koreans if you go to those uh restaurants yang mend by all those arabs or indians yes they have a mixture
for muslims also cause they are in the tourists area and I think dia punya rental dia punya duit
sewa dia every month is very expensive so they need to cover lah they need to be smart in business there in order
for them to survive mm korea jepun all the same even bali even thailand all the same but if you
meet their pure locals or pure muslims then confirm chop dia punya area
that's how they live their life I mean untuk kita kalau macam extra was-was kita jangan makan but you must we must know that there is actually two dapur
it's not one dapur they make they mix everything together no no no two different dapur
actually they yang the alcohol pun it's not really dapur lah it's just macam a bar just a bar place
err cause I'm still young now thirty two I would rather eat tasty ah but since kita pun dah ada banyak options sekarang so mm
uh what I know is that no matter how healthy the food you eat right don't eat too much lah kalau macam dia cakap buah avocado is good for your heart
don't eat avocado everyday nanti you get other complications when you get when you eat benda yang is too good everyday is no good if you search
there's this guru from india he say garlic is the best uh medicine garlic is the best natural medicine but if you eat garlic everyday you will have adverse effect to you body so basically garlic is actually a very strong
uh have very strong medicinal properties under ayurvedic punya uh cara perubatan really a lot so
in at in fact in all their ayurvedic punya treatment they all use garlic
itu aje the most the most healthiest yang I eat
apa-apa skills lah is it the the the
hardware dengan software punya skills okay basically skills right what I want skills from your beginning of the questions you ask me
whether nak jadi apa I say I nak jadi kaya kan so
cause if you can build all that is a instant money making machine ah you dah tak payah susah-susah nak kerja eight to five
or kerja shift or whatever
untuk cari nafkah you straightaway have an app
cause sekarang banyak budak-budak muda semua they
but what thing one thing they lack is actually a a product and product especially in negeri macam kita ni singapore we don't
produce any product but what we have is skill cause kita punya negeri ah is the hub for education so if we have the right skills kita boleh bikin product from that skill
I suka makan so I kalau boleh skill untuk memasak memasak macam-macam masak um but one thing eh kalau I suka masak I don't like to
masak a fusion style cause why
if you eat in malayan food council before dia punya barang mahal-mahal portion besar yes dia punya cara tempat duduk pun macam very posh
tetapi their fusion food macam betul-betul tak kena dengan tekak orang melayu even dengan tekak orang putih they don't like cause um when you
fusion western dengan asian punya makanan
uh I haven't I have not eaten in any of the restaurants yang ada makanan fusion yang betul-betul
err how to say ada dia punya rasa dia is you can actually you can want to go there again lah
ya you just go there for the one time or you just go there for a an event macam birthday ke kawan-kawan nak celebrate birthday promotions ke ah probably
sekali-sekala macam gitu dah but for
even if you have a lot of skills right but if your skill cannot make money untuk apa kan
oh ya uh the last skill eh I have eh okay basically for me eh I daripada kecil daripada menengah dua dah start belajar karate lah
uh I really want to have that kind of skill untuk
any martial art skill but I want to be very good at it macam example karate
ah judo ataupun mixed martial art but mixed martial art is very cliche very vague
karate under okinawan punya style
and okinawan punya style is actually the original punya karate lah which is actually
in fact yang karate yang
orang jepun practice is actually fake
cause orang jepun punya karate
is a is totally different it's not the original karate it's all about orang jepun it's all about perfection
so if you go to a japanese punya karate
it's called nama dia bukan karate nama dia karate-do
do dalam bahasa jepun is a way of life even judo
all the do yang kat belakang semua is actually maksud orang jepun
is a way of life so orang jepun is more on to the perfectionism
tapi if you really learn the original okinawan punya style it's more of the
the relax orang okinawa actually belajar karate like even
kalau awak awak belajar okinawa punya karate kan
even if you come late the the orang the instructor tu can actually still accept you but for orang jepun punya karate
so untuk orang okinawa punya karate is actually untuk orang malas-malas err like myself
actually orang okay the main difference between okinawa punya karate dengan japanese punya karate is this orang jepun punya karate they learn every time they fight they will learn
how to oo oo dia kira itu dia punya how they breathe is how they get their strengths is by uh contracting I think it's contract or expand okay I think ah orang jepun punya karate is by contracting their body
untuk kasih badan dia tense
uh cause untuk dia orang what they learn from
aikido judo ni semua if you
um you can practise the real okinawan punya punya martial arts ah punya ni karate cause even
dia they call this macam kita ah nama dia bunga-bunga lah kita punya silat bunga-bunga
err orang jepun pun ada cuma orang jepun
punya is a
nama dia kata kata
so kirakan okinawan punya kata is actually more
practical tapi orang jepun punya kata is actually very short and sweet cause like I say again they focus mainly on perfectionism
they don't uh focus about dia punya feel
actually ini karate ni semua eh it's actually about the feel
so if actually if you ask a budak yang belajar okinawan karate dengan japanese karate if they were to spar
hundred percent confirm budak okinawa they will win cause orang jepun they also learn kata but dia punya kata and karate dia they do not know how to apply it to real life
self defence they don't know cause untuk orang
korea punya
orang korea punya the way they fight bila when they practise
but orang jepun dia punya kata
the stands dia punya kuda-kuda dia is
so example if you fight one guy he like to fight long distance another guy is meant actually the original punya martial arts fight is for
you ask them to fight each other yang long distance they will definitely lose
cause once the okinawan punya orang
come close to japanese punya
karate punya budak
dia akan blur dia akan tak tahu apa nak bikin
okinawan punya karate will always win japanese punya karate
but the big but eh orang okinawa even though they are more relax dia punya gym you can come late all this kind of thing right
okinawa punya karate kan every class only maximum ten to fifteen people yang belajar
ah dia punya guru dia they don't like to take a lot of people so that's why okinawan punya karate lama-lama is dying out
but japanese punya karate-do
is they are they are how to say being trained in a mass level so basically in every class ada dalam hundred people
two hundred people tiga ratus orang belajar in actually in any one class any one time so what the whole world know about
karate is mostly japanese punya karate-do
ah and also in ah in japan punya karate-do
but by right the original karate yang from okinawan one
that is the true essence of okinawan punya karate
ah tu
bezanya it's actually there's a lot of difference ah you can talk
three days three nights eh tiga hari tiga malam boleh
berbual pasal ni tak habis-habis cause it's actually the punya cerita is very interesting
apa eh
okay for singapore context eh aku nak percuma senang jer
cause healthcare dekat singapore yang paling mahal lepas tu
yang lain benda percuma is of course kereta dengan rumah lah rumah jangan cakap rumah yang paling mahal
orang budak-budak singapore ni kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak kahwin tapi dia orang terpaksa kahwin sebab nakkan rumah
yang dia orang boleh mampu uh mostly is that's the case lah lepas tu yang pasal
kereta of course everybody wants to own a car even though for ten years
yang kau dah kasih orang lease for ten years engkau charge orang tu sampai hundred over thousand for a a normal car
carparks yang kita ada is tak cukup
apa barang free nak of course lah nak rumah kereta dengan healthcare healthcare is the most important
cause for healthcare dah ada pernah personal experience ah kalau dekat singapore you do not have any insurance apa-apa jadi dengan you ah
bayar lah sendiri sampai pokai
kalau ada insurance boleh cover sikit at least duit tu boleh cari juga lah
boleh apa orang cakap ah termampu
kalau no insurance at all ah kena bayar pokai-pokai ah pandai-pandai lah hidup nak
what we do okay kita tengok sejarah kita dulu-dulu
then zaman kegemilangan islam
they don't have to do anything for survival cause their life is already been taken care of the islamic the khalifah punya empire
ada dibiayai lah oleh
so apa dia orang bikin
dia belajar um err
zaman-zaman rome punya punya buku-buku
they translate daripada latin pergi arab
in fact ah even the egyptian punya historical book they can translate from egyptian to arabic
so that's why kita banyak actually a lot of our
read up about them that much but I know they are the ones who actually ah push ah macam all the
so kalau untuk zaman sekarang if you have that kind of time if we have that luxury of time
what we do right I think we also be the same thing lah we will explore untuk sekarang lagi kita ada we are very modernize
kita akan explore the space ah
ah just ah apa tu
kita manusia ni we we love to explore
we automatically learn a lot of new things lah macam gitu lah
ah repeat repeat soalan
work bukan activity work is like actually a task
task is different from activity kalau activity
okay activity yang paling boring kan eh
cause right now I'm playing my computer games I cannot imagine myself playing this computer game for eight hours straight tak boleh cause uh you need to go to the toilet to eat you need to rest
mm kalau okay lah
cause why I every time I hungry kalau rumah tak ada makan I just go to the nearest mcdonald's I just order a double cheeseburger
kira kan I don't do a lot of stuff
dekat luar I'm always at home so kalau
say about macam bad stuff no lah not really lah
kalau ada bad stuff mesti hidup pun I can't sleep at night also lah
kalau not really lah
I yang pasal ni I can't really say much lah ah ya
dia punya abs tu eight packs and after he has the eight packs everybody after him
dia jadi achilles achilles itu punya movie okay I like two movies ah in in my life right I like two movies is one is three hundred
one is ah ni lah troy so that the difference
is actually pasal orang paling kuat achilles
mm in the end he died he have a choice actually kalau dia if he if he doesn't want to die he has to stay in greece if I'm not wrong lah
had eternal glory macam orang ingat dia
any normal egoistic man he actually uh it shows kita manusia especially man ah uh all
about this movie right about three hundred and ni ah troy is all the quotes that they used
brothers what you do in life will echo in eternity itu word eh macam memang kita belajar ugama pun ustaz-ustaz pun cakap apa kau bikin kat sini nanti besok harinya pun akan kena
so it's it's about the same thing and also dalam
ah gambar-gambar macam achilles ni semua troy ni semua it's all the same thing it's their quotes eh you can actually bring it to real life and ikut lah so you won't lose out really you you won't lose out one lah
for the next two hours or six hours the book will read me so basically I'm already fast asleep but what keeps me awake is uh macam
not say I won't read I I'll read but not all those lengthy yang
texts yang panjang-panjang semua
prefer texts yang macam
yang pendek-pendek short and sweet kirakan macam gitu yes summary and also mostly
thirty two tiga puluh dua tahun
tengah buat apa is it the O levels
apa eh actually seventeen
apa eh actually nak cakap err
actually kalau if I look back in my life right
kalau whatever I've been through is actually is for my own good also
whatever lah I've been through um but kalau betul-betul nak advice of course lah um
cause at that time also kalau misal kata nak cakap oh you learn coding you learn all these app making right
resource to the in fact the poly that I learn sekolah poly that I learn is actually that was the
err orang yang ajar tu pun the knowledge of the people that teach us the lecturers are not that err they are not that brilliant also
so if you ask me to macam you know to start a something new I don't think uh there will be good advice cause
microsoft mark zuckerberg ni semua eh the way they start kan is a really is all a downhill task lah
ah so cause also apa-apapun nak kena see
tujuh belas tahun really I don't see myself having that kind of burden
to be learned wah betul-betul uh benda baru
wah ni banyak boss semua cakap gini
you just be normal stuff ah five years' time eh okay kalau cakap pasal goals eh um
I don't have the urge to buy a car cause I use to own a car and I know how expensive to own a car in singapore and really I I don't see myself like macam ada have that kind of materialistic punya goals
terus jadi billionaire
I would want to go to that path instead of any of the materialistic thing macam nak beli rumah besar
beli kereta besar all these I don't want cause benda-benda gini semua kita hidup dekat singapore we know that it won't last for cars
oh dulu first kerja err ayah kerja apa ni uh shipyard

macam visa ya mm control ah
pada itu lah independence day ah
that time um ada macam special offer lah
ah kalau yang
siapa permanent resident
kena tunggu lama sikit ah
dulu susah nak dapat citizen pun
kena nak kena sekolah kat singapore berapa lama
then after that I kerja
I kerja kat singapore
tak tahu lah maybe I participate dekat national day punya ini ke baris ke
ha itu satu juga
cause on the spot bila I dapat err merah kan they call merah
on the spot I kena pergi sana angkat sumpah lah
kena baca we the citizens of singapore
sekolah ya lah because nineteen sixty five singapore independence kan separate with malaysia err from malaysia kan
baca national anthem dia
then after that kena naik class
kena baca pledge
ah we the citizens ah hari hari
then yang majulah singapura pun
macam conductor ah wah I know three step only
dan mari kita three step jer dia itu
ya so the correct so the third year aku move out err then I was uh staying dekat my aunty's punya place lah so what happens is uh I was there uh for actually aku duduk kat rumah dia kan for very long it's about
uh I they gave me hints lah ya they gave me hints towards the end of the so I I stayed dekat dia orang punya place for one and a half years ya one and a half years err my my bedroom was actually literally the hall the hall way err they had a sofa bed down there so I was sleeping there
and then uh that was the the time where aku just uh you know just tried to just tried to to survive lah you know but the good thing was that I was not out in the streets I was I was actually you know I had a I had a roof lah and then I was you know so that was a good thing lah
correct so that was that was err err you know err at the end of the three years then err aku early this this this year ah first of january actually
err sometimes okay terms sometimes tak okay lah so that means macam um kadang-kadang she will invite me back tau macam um you know to to her to the family home lah but uh sometimes we will have some discussion she she was kind of like try to open up a discussion and then you know we will have our little debate ya and then after
um she totally changed bukan change macam apa ah so she totally macam uh you know she she's more err she she literally like uh tries to bother about what I'm doing you know uh getting to know what I'm doing and that kind of stuff I don't know what happened in the time that I was not there tapi uh aku rasa she I don't know whether she realise lah that I think family is more important than you know having I mean making making everybody conform to a certain practice or whatever that kind of thing lah so I think the the the harmony is you know in in in having a family and all that so so I I would say that she she tolerates me lah now err but but the good thing is that in the last six to seven months eh we have not had a single argument I think she has learnt to accept
yes yes yes rimas rimas is the correct word yes yes I agree I agree
I I I I also feel the same way as you you know because last time ah whenever it I'm the same as you ah mesti kalau macam cakap kan mesti nak menang tau macam in an argument eh kalau mesti nak cakap mesti nak menang so I'm always macam energetically fight back tau ah passionate macam fight back tau but nowadays kan macam I I don't know ah kenapa it's just maybe maybe it's also because we we had gone through uh certain thing ya sort of like grown up you know being out there alone being by myself you know independent and all that
so uh kita macam tak tak uh apa tu there's no more energy to to ah to to expand to to argue tau macam at the most pun kalau even if we don't agree kan nanti the conversation will just die off like that rather than it turning into become a heated argument it will just die off you know and and that's honestly that's what I prefer lah you know it's just you know you just you just stop lah just you just don't don't don't speak lah but but it's something that I have always um like macam I I'm really thankful that um she's no longer you know the the the the person that she used to be because ya because err I I knew back then eh I knew for a fact that I could not live with her I definitely definitely could not stay in the same room with her
back then but then now I realise okay lah you know she's also ageing and she's also going old and all that I'm not sure whether is it because err dia pergi haji uh last year you know the previous year she she went for a pilgrimage you know and and she was very lucky it was just before COVID struck you know so she managed to go with my dad and then after that uh she came back and err I think I don't know lah maybe maybe the experience over there changed her or or you know it could be it could be the case that she realise some things when she's there you know
actually you are right you know I'm like you know Kinder Bueno tak yang the coklat Kinder Bueno okay okay I I tell you what's the relation eh Kinder Bueno dia punya chocolate it's hard on the outside but when you get to the inside it's actually really really soft
is it is it is that is that oh for me for me I can if if if it's some if it's an issue that's very close to my heart kan I will I will ah I will be very very uh macam adamant to to keep to my belief style ah so when when I and when I'm that kind eh you that no matter what you do right I will not change and I will not follow whatever you say I will just keep to my own ini but if you were to do the reverse if you were to do the reverse psychology type of thing uh I will I will melt I will melt and I will just give in tau
so I'm the type of person and and she knows this actually she knows this dia pernah bilang dia pernah cakap I think so yes yes it's a lot with ego it's a lot to do with ego I I think so but now it's a it's a better experience lah ya and then apa
I actually find them funny lah it's just like the way they walk lah aku tak boleh dok aku aku kalau tengok dia orang jalan macam gitu kan every time aku tengok like macam it's like eh it's like eh bro your one very big ah bro ya
yes I remember that conversation very very well I remember it vividly yes of course you were the one who got me to try out for punya apa tu uh yang yang yang ni apa we we we had we had a few we had a few conversations one was one was uh the the part when you call me over the phone and we talked a very very long time you remember that part ya that was the first time kan so you ask me to apply for punya apa tu uh opening kan yang yang ala air steward
ya err I told you about my eyesight and I also told you about uh I didn't know it at whether I'll make the cut and all that and then you you were like eh come lah just just follow me lah you know just just go you know together and that kind of stuff ya and then and then that was the first convo that I that I remember very vividly the second convo than we had was at dekat tak ingat tak dia dekat kita dekat northpoint kat yishun
will you remember we weren't outside we were sitting in an open area dekat northpoint dekat McDonald's and then kat luar and then we were talking about things like illuminati lah we were talking about all the stuff that you know you remember or not and I still remember that I still remember that convo I still remember all our convos bro no no no it's okay it's but I I I I will always remember so
you you you I I know for a fact that you you when I talk to you right um the way you the perspective that you give to me is a different perspective tau which which means okay macam let's say for example eh I you you I like just now I was telling you about you know how I was out and that kind of stuff and then and then you were you were telling me about how you understood that such people behave in a in a certain manner because of you know somethings and all that for me I wouldn't be able to understand tau kenapa dia macam gitu
well I I knew that being a pilot was what I want but I didn't know that I could also try out to become like say for example an air steward you know what I mean which is not really flying flying but it's still this the the the I mean you are in the you are in the industry and you are very near to where you want to be technically ya you know so err and and and it was honestly right my mind ah is always a one track thing so let's say for example kan aku cakap okay I told myself ah I I want to become a pilot but err I will only think about okay how do I become a pilot how do I do this how do I do that I I wouldn't think of okay maybe there is another way maybe I can become a air steward first then I can jump into you know into a fancy and that kind of thing lah so I I don't have that kind of err presence of mind ah to think that I should do this and then it would eventually lead me on to the thing I'd go the straight out
so so my my life in in this industry lah in this aviation industry started out with um with simulators so it started out in the in the confines of my own in my my room uh on the computer so my dad was the one that I credit for for giving me this passion lah because he wanted to become a pilot himself tapi dia punya eyesight err macam tak err how to say eh uh not hundred percent lah not not not not a six six lah vision lah so uh and at that time kan dia orang very strict kan kalau kau punya eyesight is not perfect eyesight then you you don't even get a chance dia lain ah ah tau yes correct correct
no as in as in there's other planes there's there's other aircraft out there there's so many actually actually you are right sebab tu eh they realise eh in err in err eventually they realise that having a six six vision is not a requirement you can ya they change they change in nineteen ninety eight
nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety nine I remember this very vividly because I still remember I was in secondary school and they the first organisation that made the change was which is the air force so dia orang uh they publicised in the newspaper the very first pilot titled pilot tau who was wearing glasses ya and they put his picture big big down there I remember man on that day I bought like three copies of the newspaper I cut out all the picture and I pasted it all over my room just just to motivate myself and say that look all is not lost because I started wearing glasses when I was primary four already ya ya so I was very I have always felt that it was an impossible dream to achieve
because because dah tak boleh apa because you dah pakai you dah pakai glasses then that's that's it lah you you no more already lah no more chance right so ah so that was what spurt on my motivation uh and and make the fire burn the fire was winning back again so after that when I was in uh so after I finished secondary school right I set my sights on the youth flying club so what I did was I join the youth flying club and I managed to pass the interview you know and and go through the the thing and I managed to err err start the flying course ah so that time uh they were offering for those people who were successful and being accepted in the course they let your parents uh fly in the aeroplane for free therefore one flight macam familiarisation flight ah so both my parents actually got the chance to to to try out lah dekat err kita pergi sana then after that apa tu they they brief us and then err they they brought my parents up and then just to show them how it's like to fly and all that lah this was a very long time ago sekarang dah takde lagi tau
sekarang ah sekarang is no more already no no more they they don't offer that kind of stuff already but last time they used to so what I did was I went through the course and when I went through the course it kind of cemented my my ambition uh even further because I felt you know ah bro the very first time I flew in the aeroplane it was during my familiarisation flight dekat youth flying club tau and this was when I was sixteen lah when I was up there it was such a different feeling
there's there's that's technically true but it's not flying lightning speed ya but when I landed when my when our plane landed and when I stepped off the plane I couldn't feel my feet lah bro I was just floating I was literally just still floating I was on cloud nine I was just I was just you know but that was the thing lah that was that was this that told me like okay you know I have to I have to make this somehow come true a dream and all that lah ya so I pursued it you know I I kept on pursuing it and I studied all that I could tapi aku I made a mistake
one of the mistakes was that I thought that I needed physics macam science ah science punya subject kan err I I thought that I needed science in order for me to be able to become a pilot
uh it was a mistake because I took the wrong course when I was in junior college last time ah I I'm I'm an arts person I was more of a arts person I should have taken an art subject because that's my stronger that my forte but I chose science because I thought I needed science to become a pilot but science wasn't exactly my uh my my my strong point I mean only the aerodynamic but my physics teacher was so uh puzzled because did cakap apa tau
uh eh I realised that you can do this topic very very well it was on aviation and aerodynamics ah but your other topics ah you rabak man you cannot make it why ah then I realise that but it was it was uh uh only way way way later lah then I realise that uh okay I I I actually
ya ya ya it was that bad I was literally aku tak boleh bergerak I was just I I and I still remember that day was my uh examination my english paper punya examination and err I couldn't I couldn't move I had to call my dad for help you know send me over then when he saw my condition he's like I'm bringing you to the hospital right now ah okay so what happens is this this this condition after I remove the appendix right
it recurred again ya it recurred again so uh that was another dent in my in my in my dreams lah basically ya so that was the reason why that time you know aku pergi ah punya air steward punya interview tu yang aku pass
err actually I pass the interview okay but because they they they saw the hernia condition I failed my medical that's why aku tak aku tak dapat uh jadi err air steward as well ya so in the end in the end I so you you see how how it all ties up lah how it all times ties back together
I I don't man I had to I had to use for the operation aku pakai ni aku pakai my medisave uh my my apa tu orang panggil
uh I offset from my medisave a bit and then I paid uh pakai insurance ah macam my medical insurance ah ya err for I was working my ass off man I was working three jobs at that point of time
apa working
ada ada sikit uh my mortgage kan every month is uh one point one K uh aku punya err they cut off aku punya uh eight hundred
so aku kena top up three hundred every month there is correct yes in the future lah aku aku aku I was thinking lah anyway that one is is is always an option I I'm keeping it as an option for me lah which is why I wanted a bigger place uh the other reason was because aku ada terlalu banyak barang-barang ah all my baggage my
eh I don't mind man I really don't mind kau tahu rumah aku kat mana tak dekat it's just beside admiralty jer also admiralty is at woodlands I mean the woodlands area kan and uh the it's only about macam five minutes
tak tak tak tak it's not it's uh it's it's just opposite the ya it's opposite the it's a residential punya punya place ah
yes I was there uh okay lah it was it was uh it was it was a good it was a good experience but the problem is um when you are overseas eh err your how do I put it eh you you're considered as an expat tau so expats they they are a bit particular it depends on the administration lah so that's the reason why um most of us kan kita belajar kat sana we gain the experience then we come back here and then we we try to uh apply with the local punya okay so right now right now err so okay so so right now what happens is this eh
so uh average lah it's just typical because for me and they consider they consider me as a entry level lah I'm not I'm not a macam senior captor and all that kind of thing so for me I'm more like the first officer or second officer type of uh about four K about there lah about about uh thereabouts okay so when COVID happened
yes yes yes yes that was in during reservist right I think yes I already signed kita dah sign contract kita dah sign dok we even we even err graduated kita semua dah celebrate seh we went out drinking I mean
ah tak tak tak tak tak I didn't go through the I was supposed to go through yes correct I was already together with the rest of the other so called batch mates
yes I know I know I know that was thing so I mean there's there's setbacks lah along the way there's you know there's ujian there's setbacks there's uh
ya I know right macam nasib kentang kan macam there's always something there to to you know but it's okay ya ya I know know I've heard of it before lah this phrase I know I know
tapi I mean I I've always thought that there is a silver lining lah you know in in every ya so aku I I'm I'm I'm still in it you know I'm still in it and I'm still waiting you know ya yes yes correct I'm still waiting so I'm hoping that when this COVID thing is over you know and everything you know go slowly goes back to uh goes back on track and all that right uh I I'm pretty sure lah one day lah one day I uh you know I I I I have a deep faith for for this for this thing so one day I will I'll you know I'll be I'll be able to to do it lah
eh it's a different skill set lah sia it's a yes yes correct I know I know I just imagine myself uh being on the drone so when I see it I was like oh okay ya lah but but by by I mean it's it's the best that I can do uh uh that's relatable and that's uh you know but I think uh they they have already announced macam plans lah you know
uh they want to push us to become uh flying instructors so ya so so I think it's just a matter of time where when this thing you know dies down and everything is uh back to normal again right uh I think you know hopefully lah hopefully I won't be too old and my age becomes a factor and I'm like shit now I'm to old aku tak boleh ah dok flight tak boleh
yes yes actually you are right you are right I I agree tapi dia dia punya orang he's not a war err what you call it eh he's not those ya he's a very selfish businessman but he's not the type of war mongering you know guy that that
exactly you know he's very divisive lah dia punya talking eh dia punya words eh that he say uh selalu make people uh fight each other
ya but dia punya orang macam tak um dia punya words ah he's words are very unwise and also no wisdom lah I I find that he's very different from obama obama eh when he speaks eh dia punya cakap eh all his words eh um they are very substance tau they have a lot of substance
macam their their their thoughts lah
eh kau ada citizenship eh new zealand uh huh
ya bro that's why you need to bring the entertainment to you that means your home right will be your one stop entertainment okay eh but new zealand mahal ke eh tak mahal kan dia punya standard of living huh
ya but I but no aku rasa it's not that much of uh how do you put it eh macam I I don't know what the currency is like uh the standard of living and the cost of living over there over there but from what I'm seeing eh it seems that everybody is okay leh dia orang macam tak
but the house is not fully paid for macam mana

ah jadi at least kita tahu correct or not
ini apa but I saw on ah Facebook dia punya agents semua macam they are not selling anything else and then even their Facebook name pun ada at the back
ah so ada is it like the company doesn't allow them to sell other products you know like some companies actually they don't some things lah you know it's against their policy kan

ah but first of course our parents first ah ya of course of course our parents first lepas tu dah lepas tu dah continue ah so in the meantime people come people go back and then just makan jer ah like that one time so once we are done dah lima puluh orang then we can just go join them makan tapi cake cut kita belum
selalu cake cutting first kan selalu cake cut is the first kan
ya ke
eh okay lah okay lah okay then then the cake will be the last because after that kita terus kasi and then kita kasi dorang then they just cabut kan together with the berkat kan okay okay so oo but I need to remember to buy packaging to give the macaron and the cake macaron macaron boleh bawa balik the cake boleh makan tak ah plastic okay lah macaron plastic okay lah

ya lah awak nak cakap cakap ah
ee banyaknya
dia cuma nak duit jer buat apa nak talk to dia buat fifty fifty fifty right technically it's including am dia ikut pe
tapi memang nak kena gitu kalau dah invite banyak you need to engage an ambassador to make sure that everyone is ya it's better to have rather than nanti everyone all standing at there in front and then kena saman might as well you hire an ambassador to make sure everyone is abiding with the safe entry rule ya lah
dia boleh buat cuma siapa nak jaga macam shah ibrahim easy dia hire an ambassador that's his way tapi kita ah bila kita buat siap nak
oo I remember the question that I want to ask tukang ambil temperature
tak but ya siapa yang jaga is it our people or his people
ah just ask awak just ask put down and just ask jangan I think I think nanti saya datang eh don't have anyone ya it's err you need to ask someone from your side to do it barangkali banyak gitu pe
I don't think so cause dia tak minta dia tak kesah kalau submit name I think hotel hotel yes macam restaurant ke
I ya we really need someone to jaga the tempat seh I think rahmat have to do it I think rahmat have to do it jaga-jaga macam nanti orang datang oh cik eh cik duduk kat sini eh cik duduk kat situ eh atau atau beforehand beforehand kita buat allocation and then we update them okay you be seated at table what table what that's why we need I put I put first thirty first october is their last date to so first november kita confirm everything we assign wherever and then we can send out like send again lah macam their confirmed punya table if any changes please let us know beforehand so we can make necessary changes and all that
then wait nanti after merisik I think um the week saturday we can send out the invitation lah
can merisik is on fourth october which is sunday then the following saturday can send out the invitation so we got one week to print out whichever siapa-siapa yang awak nak kasi the hard copy then we can print out
I will I share with you ah eh got google this I dah buat schedule perangai perangai production manager cause I'm like I tengok I need to see the dates huh
ya that's why now I use mine ah I already apa apply eh pakai twenty four hours tu ya I already put it so nanti on the card ya I will just tell them to search my name ah
because when I search I dah try I signed out from YouTube and then I try searching my name just nice keluar everything mine right my account
tak I actually don't know how it works ah
I just for me pakai for me just use laptop camera can already but you awak yang nak
biar ah bukannya kita nampak it's the screen is going to be so small we're gonna be far away from the laptop
okay lor so it means you what you're trying to say is the camera tak payah like be connected to the laptop
eh besok awak kerja kan
mana tahu sometimes you go site you take a while what
entah lah
tapi fajr takut dengan mak dia mak dia marah dia diam dia ni tak dia ni jawab balik
cannot ah mesti have to dorang nak kena takut takut they need to know the consequences of their wrongdoing macam zurai tak pukul langsung
ya lah ya pukul just to dorang rasa dia punya pahit ah macam ow
nak kena sakit sikit jer
I I tengok terus I tertidur
tapi ya lah like let's same ah like my my brothers can do whatever they want perempuan aje like the rules only ya because they're they're guys ya the rules only apply to girls guys ya lah dorang lelaki nanti dorang selalu cakap ah biar ah dorang lelaki
it's it's the it's the same concept as the westerners ah like when the girl have sex a lot she's considered a slut but when the guy have sex a lot they're considered macam wow a man ya tu ah
or is it it comes from the western ah so orang tengok macam gitu kan
the children the the children will tengok at how their parents are ah nanti kalau dorang nampak dorang macam dorang nampak macam if let's say dorang nampak the father kurang ajar dengan mak dia nanti they also know they will do that to the girls also
it's no lah sometimes it's not about the father also sometimes because sekarang perempuan semua they want to be feminists ya that's also the problem ya perempuan perempuan wants the same status and rank as the guy so macam ya sekarang wives apa
tapi women now don't want to show that women need men
ya sekarang susah
I think it's okay it's okay kalau women want to be independent but ya but at least show lah kasi like give and take
tak sayang ah tu
ya they don't have time to dia you know you know I saw I read something like I think we should do it lah when we get married dia cakap tak I read somewhere it's macam an advice dia cakap how to keep your marriage alive or macam not there dia cakap make sure once a week at least once a week you go out go for a dinner a'ah then at least once a month go for a staycation or something once a month macam go for like like a someone further away somewhere further
tak okay okay okay once once a week go out with your family together with your kids once a month have a one to one date a'ah lepas tu once a year go overseas with the with the whole family this is how you keep ya ya so at least walaupun like you have children once a month you are having dates so every once a month if if any time between the first month and the second month your your love macam die sikit ah you will macam you will refresh your dating days a'ah so at least every once a month every once a month you are lighting up the candle you're lighting up the candle ah so at least diam eh ya so that so I think it's a very good advice seh macam I think ya it's it's it ya cause the thing is sekarang a lot of people
but ya but when things happen dah susah
tak lah don't have to be tak don't have to macam go out macam overseas as in pergi dekat dekat pun tak kesah macam malaysia you know that kind of thing ya just somewhere lah
ya it's about macam kita macam keluar once a week bring your children out is macam gi bawah main-main ke a'ah just macam every sunday ya so macam picnic ke bring your own food ah pastu macam bila dating pun tak suruh pergi mana-mana mahal macam just go out dating jer huh ya just go out like apa
ya that is the daily that's the daily punya cure ah tapi susah because I think everyone is working tapi dorang cakap kan dorang cakap kalau let's say suami dia actually dah solat abeh bini dia nak solat suami tu boleh solat lagi just to imamkan dia something like that kan macam let's say kalau wife wife dia dah solat sekali lelaki dia datang
ah lepas tu lelaki let's say the husband datang balik balik dari kerja it's okay that the wife solat lagi dengan dia just so ah suami dia macam just boleh solat jemaah lah with the wife
nanti balik ah imamkan
sekarang ya the thing is sekarang cakap senang nanti mesti ada dugaan dia bisikan syaitan tak payah lah tak payah solat jemaah pergi solat sendiri-sendiri sudah dah apa ayah why you never pray what time already siapa anak siapa anak syafiq eh ayah what time already
tak lah dengan mak bapa dia dorang sendiri-sendiri dengan awak jer dengan kita jer nak solat dengan kita tapi dorang kat rumah sendiri-sendiri

iphone eleven dalam one thousand plus ah
so if kalau tambah plus atau yang eh sorry iphone pro eh iphone pro dengan iphone pro max
yang tu kena check dulu like dia punya harga berapa
oh so I think tengok tempat dia plan jer lah tengok macam mana dia punya plan dia berapa gigabyte
berapa incoming call free semua like
dia punya specs ah
hmm tengok benefit benefit dia
but currently you use what phone currently pakai phone apa
ya ya our saudara
alamak drill ah buto sorry sorry pause
yang iphone eleven tu uh you plan to take which plan
tu full price ah no contract ah
oh actually iphone seven also not bad tapi I I would suggest iphone eight ah because it's the latest kind of ya it it's the best it's the new iphone ah
I think tu paling terbaik lah kalau nak nak apa nak fikirkan iphone eleven is really good enough ah
ya so that one that time was during COVID kan so sebab dia orang nak kasih murah sebab
iya lah sebab COVID kan so not to get more consumer to buy the phone lah at a cheaper price ya
even ah android phone pun sama lah like google the new google apa pixel kan they they make it cheaper lah but I think the specs wise of course it's a bit kurang lah compared to the previous one ya
must check the new iphone right jap eh let me check eh
it has a better bionic chip the apa it's I think it's similar to iphone eight design touch
ya they are still selling I mean um you must check you must check takpe ah ustaz tengah check
takpe ah ustaz kena check dia punya iphone punya iphone store
iphone X eh iphone X jap jap jap there's a face iphone
oh our ni eh parents eh
I think biasa ah mum is sleeping then I think bapak baru balik ya and
ah bapak kerja ah dekat ni lah iya dia kerja ni lah hari ni kerja pe hari ni hari rabu kan
tak lah I think he working three times a week
tu I think paling penting ah so like macam nanti um once I've started working
kalau tak nanti macam before this kerja macam tak prepare sangat setakat apa
macam relax relax tapi nanti end up macam tak belajar apa-apa macam cause
apa start started working kan you will forget a lot of things so really technology keeps changing kan so you need to
for coding ah ya so basically it's not that hard lah because really we can just uh search up in the in the apa
ya ya some some some apa some company kan they
they know ah whether you you've you search online ke tak lah cause they cause I think the most important I don't think is the first interviewed I mean the coding test is not really important ah it's the second round where most probably is a face to face
if you are not really strong in an interview then you need to practice ah you need to really improve on it ah then you have higher chance to to be apa to be offered lah by the company
jangan kena pijak ah gitu
tapi like looking into like contract or apa
uh full time ke part time
tapi kalau full time pun there's a lot of expectation kan macam
tapi N level start sama time eh dengan O level
tapi ah the
ya tapi the condition sekarang condition sekarang macam mana dia punya COVID dia orang ambil O level december apa this COVID kat
but dia orang ambil same timing dia orang ada own shift ke apa atau it's just one time
so you're mostly your job hunting specifically ah system engineer lah you are looking to that position atau you are looking into different role
different roles in terms of dia punya ni lah
software engineer ke if
macam mana nak spell F O R T L A N
apa skills ah like
for example apa eh okay name like
I think it's like flutter dia ada own language which which covered dart eh dart ya I think mostly high level also
there's also google language they have their own language which is apa go golang eh golang
like owned by google ah so they they have their own language they make their own ni designed by them
yang tengah ah siapa yang tekan biasanya the manager kan the apa uh the business punya side the project manager dia orang akan tekan kan this apa
but each country like they have their own server ke atau they have their own
means like singapore have one server so lain negeri ada their own server ke
atau combine macam asia
abeh sekarang like ah
you know macam COVID pun is getting better kan singapore
malaysia pun like they they do open the border kan to singapore kan macam only for those yang business
ah green lane semua
so for the purpose of those yang ada rumah kat sana kan dia orang boleh ya for us I think we can't ah sebab we are going there basically nak apa
nak cuti kan
actually boleh balik ah because technically she is ni kan she is not singaporean kan
actually I'm not sure like our cousin yang always uh who are staying there kan who are staying there syakilah iman do they dia orang boleh datang sini ke
unless dia orang ada they ada kerja dekat sini lah dia orang ada kerja kan atau rumah kat sini kan
the malaysia people ah the ah all our saudara kat sana
oh cik rozi lama tak call eh
alhamdulilah dah makan dah I think
mum cook apa kari ayam so we just ate tu lah we just ate the
kuah apa kari ah kuah kari and I just cook telur sikit then makan
tapi tu lah
ah that one the smell nanti apa
iya lah bau dia kan nanti tu kan nanti iya lah tutup tingkap
but I know ah I know how to cook macam like simple simple ah like usually I cook thai food ah sweet and sour fish
and kai lan ikan masin
baby kai lan ikan masin so macam setakat ikut ni ah ikut youtube and
ya kadang-kadang beli kat ni fairprice
giant so just beli apa
barang-barang semua dekat ni ah barang-barang kat giant and fairprice
kalau ada takde ah just find a replacement ah macam
that time takde ikan apa eh ikan tenggiri ke apa eh
so uh I replaced it with ikan apa nama dia
tak tahu ah nama dia ikan terprau macam ikan masin ah macam ketul-ketul macam cube ikan cube
simple lah dia punya masak it's not that hard ah just ikut dia punya youtube punya tutorial
ah boneless and dia macam I think it's dried ah dried food dried fish
ya macam you you macam very dried lah dia bukan dekat mana dekat belah apa dekat tempat
ya so macam like it's in terms in the form of cube ah cube then with that cube just ah letak kat kuali isi dengan minyak lepas tu
once the the fish dah tu kan
dah lembut ah baru tu lah pecah-pecahkan ikan tu lepas tu letak baby kai lan
letak kicap oyster sauce so once dah
dah panaskan I think like
five to ten minutes dah siap
but for fish I think it's a bit troublesome ah kena kena masak ikan dulu kena apa make sure letak dengan tepung ah tapi dia punya sauce senang nak buat ah sweet and sour sauce
tapi tu lah I think this is like the starting point ah cuma macam nak I think I took me awhile ah like I think what I cook at most one hour two hours very tiring macam you need to macam
potong ni lah
ya true ah barang-barang dah siap if someone already did that for me kan senang ah I think my life will be easier
cuma itulah you need
tapi boleh ke macam tu macam ada ada agreement dia is just one house kan the maid
the agreement biasanya one maid macam
jaga one house kan
iya lah iya lah of course
ah iya lah
pause jap eh pause jap
but if the maid macam they have their own tu kan kerja timing dia kan
but for weekday they work like almost the whole day kan except malam ah kan
dah berumur ya
mmhmm betul
ada lah dekat fairprice fairprice fairprice punya online
ada lah sometimes I think
that time I saw like macam halal punya daging kan
ya really ni lah dia punya which section eh the section yang ada frozen food
actually I saw this youtube video ah very interesting dia macam punya shopping
tapi I don't think singapore ada ah dia macam like I think in america ke apa ah which country atau china
ya like you need it it's like the shop the shop kan there'll be someone who welcome you pastu ah you using the lah I think it's a like the device ah you need to buy the device device
if if memang ya stock finish of course the thing is empty lah dia punya ni ah
tapi it's very hard ah like I mean the software wise like
iya lah iya lah
of course ah dia punya price mahalnya it's like you're playing four punya punya tu kan console
but I think can be solved ah like technology wise macam they keep changing kan most like it's probably ah I feel very interesting like how
like especially this COVID times like how technology they try to change ah macam in terms of like the new normal
like dulu takde kan I think previously my company my former company dia pernah offer ah work from anywhere so one year macam they give like seven days ah
kat rumah lah you can can stay at home or go overseas apa
ah ya lah as long as you do something lah usually the manager will ni lah the
you need to be apa
ah ya lah my company former company use zoom for ni lah
macam container ah nak letak something container like small one ah ya but I think ah
tak tahu ah hari tu my friend tanya nak pergi ikea ke tak dia ajak
ya they they limit ni lah the number of ah customer to enter the restaurant they limit like about not too sure berapa ah
you cannot sit like you only can like usually people like those yang one person kan they will sit at the seat of four kan nanti macam they don't apa utilise the space ah they don't make use of the space
then end up macam the queue is long sometimes ya most of the time lah kalau weekend kan in tampines kan
ya the queue selalu panjang
nak control eh ya ya
ya betul
oh iya lah iya lah
ya I think it's a bit tu lah a bit
it's a bit scary ah kalau if
ada orang break the rule apa kan
like actually you say you heard places yang some
apa dia orang kena ni kan kena warning kan because of this thing kan
like the customer tak ikut ni
ya lah you see like in at apa shopping mall like it's those crowded kan nowadays macam susah nak control ah
ya I think they will just monitor lah this apa maybe there's someone
watching the ke apa kan they have their own
ya maximum occupancy also but I don't think there's sensor there's sensor yang
macam detect
check out lah don't check out lah ya it's very difficult to ni
about I think regarding the the battery lah dia cepat habis ah
like the the nearby devices kan siapa yang
um google and apple kan to ni with the android dengan phone
or you still stick with ni
I think this is still depends cause google home kan they detect ni kan the surrounding kan
as long as jauh ah microphone dengan I mean dia punya google home kan ada microphone kan
I'm not too sure ah like like what will be the reply like ah macam default like
ya maybe ah maybe ya ya the default punya default
oh iya lah iya lah ada offline data lah persistent storage ah
maybe you can try like alexa ke
tapi but then it just think of us like their lagipun singapore is moving into smart nation kan so at certain points at certain ah zone for example I think punggol ke sengkang eh
like punggol kan there's there's a lot of flat kan so I think these flats dia orang ada their own smart punya apa devices ah macam ah smart light smart oven smart like most of the most of the devices in in our in our house is
like smart lah basically so bila macam masuk bilik
for example smart light you enter a room kan nanti dia macam the intensity akan increase ah
as we walk into macam tu example jer lah
so tak payah tekan butang ke apa
I think they have ah macam
ya macam ada sensor kan
ah iya lah iya lah
because now like I think the manually the manual one I think we saw in different country kan dia kat india eh
ya there's some country use that ah macam pedal ke apa
I think in singapore ada some building kan dia macam like if inside the lift takde button
only kat luar jer
those abilities like macam
but for me right I've always wanted a superpower that can help others similar to yours macam you cakap you want to be superman atau pun nak jadi
oh bat sorry batman or iron man okay kau nak jadi batman or iron man I would also want a superpower yang
mm dia bukan dia bukan specifically target a superhero this is just a superpower
ah so for me oh ya teleporting eh didn't actually come across my mind until tadi sebut teleporting
any place of the world you tau macam harry potter
err magic spell I forgot lah apa magic spell ah
mm ah disapparate ah dia orang disapparating but they can only do that when they come of age ah
goblet of fire cedric diggory yang ada siapa tu yang handsome tu nama dia ah
the telepathy must be something that I can switch on and switch off like if I want to know what the other person is thinking or if if I want to communicate without talking or gestures to the other person I can like macam switch on and off
budak-budak kan
for me to macam tahu what are they thinking about why are they thinking about
I do not want macam to be burdened
ah boleh on and off ah gitu
the thing is on and off lah I think every superpower ada burdensome
telepathy ah eh sorry apa
it depends lah whether you have more time the thing is people I think people nak this
duit definitely okay
okay apa
superpower macam okay teachers are also have superpower that's what I believe ah
you know young to young okay to you it might be nothing like helping a kid fall down or jaga or apa
budak nangis datang kasi peluk to orang besar kan macam nothing ah tapi
in the mata like macam orh
but what if naik lemak
like they dia orang tak nak
they just expect to be given eh dia ni rich apa so tak payah lah work hard so we just wait for him apa to durian runtuh
unlimited duit
it's something that you think of lah but I to me I think you know me as a person kan I'm not a person that wants unlimited duit
with unlimited duit
because ah okay the thing is something there macam
I cannot get your perspective is because money is the root of all evil that type okay but that apa I respect it's just that I'm just
since you were saying superpower apa ni your superpower of unlimited duit
if there's if that's if there is someone kan macam
ubat for COVID nineteen like the perfect ubat
for COVID nineteen like maybe I would want to study belajar macam mana like
like macam
free only untuk
K the thing is I think kan kalau untuk ubat-ubat canggih ni kan
probably free depending on what type of ubat
err like singapore singapore doesn't give macam a lot of things percuma free
I cannot you cannot please anyone everyone betul tak
apa you your superpower that you wanted was
unlimited duit
knowledge you pun macam meh uh macam gitu lah

so kita ada dalam
satu minute
harus actually bottom line is just to kerja keras lah
itu lah simple lah eh
ini bukan syarahan lah
tu macam bagus eh
cerita kami ni eh
okay ada lagi lima saat empat saat
no I think I think she like macam because her life
got so susah kan so she want like
she tak nak tengok dia punya husband and new wife hidup senang
ya so I think that's what she wanted lah so that the husband hidup susah juga macam tak fair kalau
I think she fell in love with the company as in because the guy is always there for her tapi cause that's what she's not getting from the husband what
who the siapa
dia berapa episode ah sixteen eh
but other than that I think macam the korean punya broadcasting stations all like their um
ah no sebab kan
so I hardly ever like really habis kan any drama
I actually for my migraine lah cause my ubat migraine finish already
skin condition if it's like macam he can lah
then he said is a malay doctor quite young then dia cakap can ah but
he will prescribe topical or oral punya ubat like they don't do aesthetic services ah
then I say okay I understand then lepas tu dia cakap but if you want I can try to give you like
macam the first three months I give you this ubat
because he said is not ah because I I I did ask him is my macam I feel like my face is so macam rabak ah then dia cakap
oh err it's not like macam really a severe case so I can still macam prescribe prescribe
ubat for you
but I have cheeks I have like comedonal acne on my cheeks all the all the all the kecil-kecil punya biji
ya lah like macam there's no head on top right
like I don't macam I don't see myself spending
but yours is not like macam yours is just macam white heads kind of
ah you just get from Cosrx kat Watsons ada
maybe that's because like macam depends on the product lah
haven't yet macam usually my cystic acne right other than this lah
usually they will just be there no head and then after some time they just gone gitu jer
like macam after you get you've after you give birth like macam
and then apa bekam kan muka ada mini cups LOL what the heck
even even in even on weekends right macam rare gila
I think aini macam semua turun-menurun because ayah dulu pun ada pe macam gini
you see ayah face lah or all the macam wak mak long also have like
like the bekas-bekas
I regret one thing I regret right macam in my life
my poly first year seventeen when I gatal-gatal you know bila
ya lah then because you remember you gave me the Kat Von D foundation dulu
you use the macam the high the heavy duty punya Kat Von D dulu then
no lah I'm just saying then I didn't know what macam I didn't know last time there's lightweight foundation and heavyweight foundation what so I just use that every time so macam I think that
but it's so it's not accessible nak beli
ya so kirakan macam
kalau pakai makeup lebih
muka muka lagi rabak even though like macam I do the proper cleansing ah
ya because like macam I don't put anything on my face what and I do macam regular
punya skincare
pakai plaster
I know I mean it's the wrong timing for my pimple sticker to habis but don't know ah see how lah later
ya kebaya
boots no I never buy I never buy I only buy like strappies and the tu
apa senang lah kalau nak pergi kerja
two bikes what then I thought like macam he thought when I get my license then I just
use that lah rather than to leave that bike all the time kat car park jer tak buat apa-apa
the high maintenance mean kalau buat delivery is very macam will cepat rosak and cepat
masalah so naz will spend more if he use that bike to do delivery
bapa dia orang kecil bapa dia orang that time datang sembang dengan ayah I thought bapa dia gini ayah ayah like lagi tinggi jer
habis ayah habis ayah gini ayah bend down nak salam satu match up
or where mana lagi ada tu

I don't even know what colour the mum kejap dusty pink lah apa
ya ya aryan yang boy tu

then dia orang dua macam kawan but then when when we ask them
ya but very kasihan you know cause recently
the boy baru kena diagnosed mild dyslexia

then the mum macam is additional stress lebih-lebih lagi the guy because the this guy this boyfriend kan
macam very different from the rest punya ah you know haikel your junior secondary school junior haikel azni
remember the very macam self-obsessed guy
kakak dia baru eh adik dia ke kakak dia baru kahwin
he is the ex boyfriend then then that this haikel also macam very uh
like I mean I mean if you date the kakak you already know the kakak got anak right I mean technically
tapi dah bersih ah sekarang
he damn putih
ya so very self-obsessed dia ambil macam rambut dia kan tak pernah tak ada pomade or whatever tau tak pernah set tak set
ya they dated for like macam a few years or what then he left because apparently the mum tak suka the kakak
haikel punya mum
assume it's because ada anak kot
ya but but the mum macam rabak gila the mum tak uh kasi salam pun dia tak pandang pun
ya exactly habis kalau dia orang uh macam dekat luar rumah ke apa kan
nanti dia akan cakap kan tak mahu bawa masuk tak mahu kasi masuk rumah apa semua so fadiyah is always at outside the house
ya damn kasihan right so macam after some time this haikel also this haikel also macam
mak dengan mata air obviously mak what so left her then the second boyfriend
also left her because cakap masih nak enjoy life masih nak party life this is like macam
have their own kecantikan
but she damn kasihan I feel like whole like is very kasihan because like
do you know do you know about the anak dia punya bapa
the anak punya bapa passed away when the aryan was two years old
bike accident dekat you know belakang marsiling itu
yang err marsiling road yang yang belakang stadium
that road kan dulu kan tak ada kan sana kan
so the road dulu kan senyap gila so macam accident
ah basil bawah lagi apa dia punya yang atas punya yang directly behind stadium nobody knows
dia orang dua motor dia kawan tau
so dia got tumpang satu then another bike is in front
so the one in front dah memang kat depan okay ah tiba-tiba kat belakang tak ada kereta tak apa crash
so it's either dia tersendiri self skid or what ah pillion dia okay
pillion dia tak buka mulut only buka mulut to lawyer
because some of them cakap oh this one uh macam some of the friends cakap ah okay the pillion nama is fir tau
so fir cakap ah dia orang cakap ini confirm confirm fir yang bawah kirakan fir cap merah you know the bike so that's why dia tak nak buka mulut dia buka mulut kat lawyer jer
but then if if it's true ah that's just fucked up ah macam kau bawa cap merah habis kawan kau meninggal sial
like then he she he never tell he when ah aqilah asked right dia just cakap oh dia tak ingat apa-apa

then dia macam huh
she's twenty six so ya she gave birth at sixteen habis she still wanted to finish
but then oh when she macam bila mak dia bawa pergi doctor to check that she's pregnant or not she's eight months pregnant
so kirakan the whole time right dia just tak buat apa-apa ya then
ah dia cakap ah because like she suspected that she was pregnant habis lepas tu the

oh then ibu then ibu you give ibu
because it's unhealthy punya way of losing weight lah you probably lost weight because you didn't have proper meals or what
mm even when countries macam like uh mana eh

macam when I was at gold coast right

I think some of my ex colleagues did that but dekat

eh terkeluar eh babi
no lah later if my eye berair all
ya can make your bulu ketiak straight also
sterilise ah kononnya
you know malaysians have this malaysians have like some cream treatment like macam they inject shit into their face
so macam a bit hypocrite
I baru makan tiga hari
masih ada it's still selling at baraqah
but I don't feel like macam I just wanted to try this first
ya Odella made me lose weight because I shit a lot I shit sampai air watery
my err itu ah immune
oh you didn't drop out ayah quit
ayah called ayah told me after tu
err what do you think boleh
is it wah just now also I sibeh sleepy sia I don't know why tapi macam I think cause the the err shopping mall was very noisy so macam tak boleh tak boleh concentrate ah so like like everything too noisy then kita pun nak dengar cikgu pun tak boleh then we have to lean remember we were like leaning in to try and hear her like and it was like
ya you all intended to macam invite orang lain or no just the two of you
oh dia datang pukul berapa
then you balik rumah makan eh
mm I like the the chicken cutlet noodles and the chicken cutlet apa tu curry rice
ya it's like just the chicken cutlet so juicy reminds me of that time when I went to punya apa tu dia punya Cheers store kan then lepas tu tak ada tempat makanan halal so I just went to the Cheers store beli dia punya microwave food then err the microwave food I I bought this japanese curry katsu rice
set and then it was honestly okay just that the the curry err the the chicken was like very small and it was I think because microwave kan so it was macam a bit soggy already ya so it wasn't crispy so I'm now I'm thinking about crispy chicken now ya
oh this morning I was actually quite happy cause err I woke up at what time eh like around ten o'clock ya then I was a bit hungry so tapi like err there wasn't enough breakfast for me leftover from my family so I asked my helper to help me cook
nuggets and french fries ya so while she was cooking right then haziq called me ya then then ya haziq called me so I was super super happy because like macam dah lama tak dengar dia punya suara ya so I so I was super happy so the moment I answered the call right
ya cause he wanted to take his laptop hashtag priorities ya then err ya so he he wasn't supposed to walk lah technically but like he just waited for dia punya nurse to close the door then he secretly go and walk to his bag to take the laptop ya then err he was really happy I think he sang like I think like almost ten songs seh
then like he sing kan sampai nurse kat luar semua sampai I think like around like almost the entire ward boleh dengar dia nyanyi ya so like but then the nurses were very happy lah cause dorang pun tengok apa tu dia dah how many days tak macam macam tak sihat so sekarang dia tengah happy dia tengah sihat so dorang pun happy ah
so dorang pun macam tengah motivating him like wah wah today sing a lot ah just sing some more lah okay don't need to wait for tomorrow just sing more now ya so like
alhamdulillah boleh gembira sikit ya my heart is like tenang sikit ya so that was my morning then after that like while he was talking to me his mum suddenly came in like she never in knock apparently ya so mak dia datang pastu dia kena hang up lah so pasal dia tak nak tak nak kena kena tangkap ke apa kan so then err
err then after that he still texted me lah like oh now today like a lot dia nya dia punya sedara datang ya nak nak uh nak visit nak tengok ya so he just like uh kena layan dorang ya then just now right before I met you he was telling me that like dia nak watch netflix on his laptop tapi bapa dia tengah pakai so he was complaining then I'm like never mind lah your bapa tengah
tengah doing work kan then was like ya doing work but ya lah it's okay I'll just use ah then his sister was also using his ipad ya so he was using and his sister was using the ipad lah then he also cannot use to watch netflix so now he's watching TikTok
orang tengah sedih kena makan comfort food then after that gain weight after that gemuk after that uh regret
semalam ya I went out to go to the hospital tapi I tak dapat jumpa haziq lah cause err dia tengah rehat so I just duduk kat bawah jer ya what about you
belajar makan eh makan apa kat situ
no I always go to the choa chu kang one cause I gym kat choa chu kang ya so sometimes after work I go to choa chu kang to gym but there's always a long queue ya so I will join the queue err I will join is an electronic queue lah so I will go there scan the code then err I will join the queue then after that err they will they will text you when it's your turn
gym box ya the gym box punya queue management system is like that
but err in like after twelve then after that I wanted to go gym ah then cause my gym dia punya bawah ada this new burger king then cause our area you know there isn't a burger king nearby so I always never I'm like burger king deprived you know me and my fast food oh shit yesterday I eat burger king today I eat nuggets oh damn
right because our house area tak ada burger king dah lama then this is the newest one
ya so I think next time like I would still recommend the the apa tu the mozzarella cheese burger to other people tapi kalau if I were to go back to burger king I'll end up ordering the swiss the mushroom swiss instead lah
then I park at this super far away punya car park cause dia punya parking fees very cheap it's like for one hour is like one dollar and eight cents
that is super cheap like that's the cheapest already normal price err all the other parking lots are like double the price is exactly double the price macam two dollars sixty cents uh sixteen cents ah ya ya but my worry cause I never went there before kan so
but when I went there I takut like because it's quite ulu
dorang cakap ada shuttle bus ah tapi kalau because I'm gonna go there at night so I takut like
uh kalau bilang nanti bila malam nanti nak nak balik kan nanti ada benda
right smack in front of the only lift there ya so the moment like kalau apa-apa ternampak cabut ya ya then like I think cause it was so ulu so when I waited a I parked my car kan then after that I waited for the shuttle bus kat bawah
ada like dua budak lelaki budak melayu ni tengah tengok jer probably wondering like what the hell am I doing there cause I think cause I was like uh macam wearing office clothes ish ish lah I was wearing with jeans ah the top macam uh like office punya punya baju lah
ya then after that dorang tengok jer apa budak ni tengah buat kat sini ulu ulu punya tempat
ya so I tapi tak kesah lah so like the shuttle bus quite reliable honestly speaking ya so when I took the shuttle bus then I drop off at where I was supposed to then I went to the makan place the kaki makan tu ya and I ate my favourite err what's that called the lor mai kai ya
then I wanted to buy dia punya what's the one that we ate that time oh dia punya honey barbecue bao the one that was very big and fluffy right that time we ate ya but this time dorang tak ada semua dah habis so they only had like siew mai and lor mai kai and the typical nasi lemak so I didn't want to eat so heavy for the nasi lemak so I just got the cause the lor mai kai itself is already quite big right
and I want to try the there's noodles also so like I reach there around six O five ya then err when I go there then I wanted to buy the noodles cause that time we didn't get to try the noodles kan so dorang cakap uh noodles the person who cook the noodles uh only available sampai pukul enam then I'm like but it's six O five
so I missed it by five minutes ya it was so sad but it's okay lah uh inshallah next time ada rezeki boleh dah makan
makan noodles dia there was this err it's a bit like ban mian ya it's it looks a bit like ban mian but like I think got like hot dog and egg and fish I think ya ya ya ya so it's like you know on like a cold rainy day that's the kind ya you just really want to makan ya like you just craving kan
ya so I just like I wanted that was the they say like all the noodles like the the cook dah dah balik rumah lah so I just like okay tak ada rezeki then ya then err ya then I ate there then err the person I ask the person whether can I stay there for a longer period cause by right dorang tutup uh pukul tujuh
eh pukul tujuh eh pukul tujuh ke pukul lapan ya something like that ya but then I wanted to stay sampai kul sembilan ah tapi dorang cakap dorang tutup sampai pukul tujuh pukul lapan gitu tapi uh they allow me to sit dekat luar dia punya outdoor seating so it's not really outdoor lah it's still within the building it's just that it's outside the shop
ya macam in a way communal area lah tapi ada meja so okay lah so I makan there I duduk there sampai pukul sembilan gitu then after that I just went home ya I went back to the shuttle bus ya wah ya the shuttle bus was so hard to find like err cause it was a loop so I wanted to go to the other end of the loop ya but then ya it was so hard to find and thankfully
ya but alhamdulillah ya lah okay lah tak nampak apa-apa then I just balik rumah jer lah
ya I think so we still have like macam forty minutes to go
this is the kind of weather that you just want to hide under the selimut then after that you just sleep ya sia it's like so windy I hope I hope when we play the badminton later it won't be too windy ya but I think even if it's windy I think I will still be fun lah
ya ya tapi I saw kat sebelah dorang ada roller the want to roll the floor err when it's wet ya so ya it's not effective I must I must say that first as in how to say it's not very effective but it helps with the drying ah pasal it like last time when I tengah main netball kan I always use that roller to spread out the rain
actually no I wanted to teleport so I can go all over the world and like you know lah I like to travel the world kan ya so like if I teleport I don't even need to go and flights I don't need to pay for flights and technically I don't even need to apa tu
err stay in hotels also cause like I just teleport home tidur one night then the next day teleport to greece again or something like that ya so okay lah ya okay I need to aim to be like you
ya I I saw a few videos on it lah during during circuit breaker cause I mean during circuit breaker tak ada apa-apa nak buat kan ya so I just duduk rumah tengok video like in a way very sensitive content just tengok jer ya so I always get that then like like honestly right when I hear that it makes me happy but at the same time sad also
to be called a smart malay I'm just to me I'm just right I'm just trying my best that's all to survive in this singaporean society and I think to you whether you are malay or chinese or indian ya like so the fact like when when people tell me oh you went from then go to wah smart ah then in my recent job interview pun dorang tanya oh I think your academic background is very good
ya so like those err from what I understand is more of like those people yang dorang nak lari dari rumah uh dorang punya mak bapa selalu tak ada kat rumah uh apa tu maybe maybe you might need financial assistance all that pun ya selalu gaduh kat rumah and all that gaduh dengan kawan gaduh dengan cikgu that kind ya so err that is what apa tu Mendaki is trying to do lah ya this was err last year
you have you affected them so much that they change their lives around ya so that's what I wanted to do lah so I want I wanted to do that so like when I went to the interview right they were the wah the interview was like what like dua jam siol ya so ya so like I was talking for so long ya err I mean cause they want I think in a way they really wanted to get to know dorang punya volunteers
ya just to make sure that like you know in terms of adab in terms of your akhlak semua uh boleh pass lah ya like macam there is no macam red flag ya so like because these are people like the people like the student that we will be dealing with is like those people yang betul betul need help ah ya so like if you teach them the wrong thing then macam err Mendaki has to answer in a way lah so I I understand where they are coming from
very english lah like not not queens english but like I concentrate more on english and my malay was terrible kan ya but then now I mean I am improving lah in a way in my malay err language exposure ya so like when I err my my question to them was like I am macam in a way
like will they want to even listen to my advice or will they even want to like they probably cannot relate to me lah like your just be like your problem is different apa kau kan anak-anak orang kaya that kind ya so that was what I was afraid of lah my intention was to help them tapi kalau orang tak nak apa tu uh they don't want me to help then
ya so like cause the the mentor always like I mean like always rushing to school rushing to work before that right ya so like he didn't realise that the kid was sleeping at his void deck and he didn't even tell him ya so wah I'm like wah if I were to be in that mentors shoes right what would I do you know like I cannot imagine myself doing that so macam to be honest in a way I just lost confidence ah like in what I am able to do
ya but recently some of my friends have been asking whether I want to join or not ya but I don't know still thinking about it right now my life macam still huru-hara so I need to let it get it settled first lah don't spread your eggs in two many basket ya too many things man
like it can be a controversial opinion tapi macam
mm ya and I feel like that like free education right will only help to a certain extent ya I think like underlying problems such as macam maybe social and familial situations ya so for example like those
those students like like let's say they have problems at home like in a way their parents are getting divorced ya then macam dorang tak boleh they cannot like how say is very they can overcome it definitely that is is not impossible but it's still very hard lah like you know like how they say equality versus what ah equity
abang kita kena buat recording untuk survey ni kan
oh okay okay can can boleh boleh
um kena berbual pasal apa though like what we
ya I mean movie also boleh and
say that time err me and abang afal pergi tengok movie dekat cinema movie apa
ah your eyes tell dia punya movie is pasal is a ah japanese movie lah so kita dia punya cerita sedih gila
I don't know I was just like tengah nangis-nangis rabak lah but then the cerita is about like satu perempuan ni dah macam dia buta temporarily
ya like tak buta mata lah because like he she was like she got into an accident
and like lepas tu like
macam dekat part of the story was like the guy that dia suka or like macam jatuh cinta bila dia tengah buta kan
it's actually it was was one of the reason why dia buta
ya ah because of like when he got when she got into an accident the lelaki tu macam buat benda yang like
tak tak supposed to buat lah because you know you know
ah then after that like it lead her to macam buta sekarang tapi dia tak tahu
then yang paling sedih part is actually like bila
err perempuan tu kena undergo surgery kan pasal boleh actually boleh like rawat lah like boleh get better so that guy pasal that guy macam very poor tapi dia dia macam dalam dia tengah kerja kat macam you know
kerja cara wrestling semua so kerja untuk like because they macam ah couple what
so like that guy macam ah dia
kerja sampai dapat duit untuk undergo for that girl to undergo surgery ah
then after and then after that bila like uh
ya so because of that rant dia bagi like duit to undergo surgery then when the surgery tu was successful
dia nak tinggalkan perempuan tu lah because he doesn't want to like
and after that yang part sedih was that like since like now she can see right but the thing she doesn't know how that guy looks like
dia macam contact later like contemplating whether he should jumpa perempuan tu balik or like
tinggalkan so bila part like
bila part dia nak pergi kat perempuan tu dia kena stabbed
from like this like bad people because dia dulu kerja memang jahat
then after that dia kena coma for two years ah
lelaki tu kena coma for two years and after that he was in like this like care hospital macam orang jaga then that girl was one of the volunteer
you know the thing is like bila coma so he cannot talk what
ah that's japanese punya movie lah but then bila like sekarang hospital tu then the guy was like the the guy saw the girl but he cannot say anything then he was crying so bad then perempuan tu macam
apa ni like
then like he alleged actually before that he also macam buat sculpture
ceramic so he before that macam when dia buta he she felt the lelaki muka ah
so and then after that uh I think macam there was one this music box yang reminded of both of them
one of the pekerja kata dengan perempuan tu yang there's this guy who came in the
crying while listening to music box terus dia tahu ah that was like the last part terus dia tahu yang
apa it was the guy that
ya but then the only reason why she wanted to undergo the surgery was because the guy kata um you don't want to see like our home together our future together our child together then the part damn sad ah sedih gila and after that ya me and abang was like tengah teared out already then the whole cinema tengah nangis gila kelakar gila seh
no I mean like if I explain all obviously like it doesn't really make sense lah but then if you tengok the trailer is already so sad ya that's like the the movie yang like made me cry so bad
in a cinema like never in my life I cry so bad but I cried so bad there then even my abang was like are you crazy
kat netflix kan
how many seasons ada though
eh banyak
wah it's like macam the
dia pada like when he was like a'ah
dia semua ingat dia orang macam like weird
who are this semua nak
kahwin semua and like a lot of people look down on him lah
oh ah betul betul
serious ah ah so like betul betul just like awkward lah
ah tak boleh just
just like kahwin terus lah dia dia straight
but like to me like nowadays I don't I'm not that interested in those like mat salleh
here ya actually like I mean like what this was like the whole year this year I've been like watching just like K drama everyday even me and kakak and abang also like watch everyday like at the
eh but then like thankfully like ibu and bapa is like

I I beli like I bought there was like
a few only then I'm like I mean okay lah it's not that expensive so ni lah I I don't really care I don't mind I'll just buy it
then you know last week I went to this like cafes called gather the misfits dekat
dekat somerset
it's like bingsoo then I went to this like plus eighty two cafe dekat dengan
ya and to me like those type of cafes I actually expected to like lebih mahal
start a cafe but I know that in singapore is like very mahal like like you want to the rent all is like it's not cheap
a'ah then kau kalau also need to promote then what if like orang don't want to come so
tapi makanan semua nak kena sedap kalau tak sedap then that was the problem fit in the cafe
ah they just go there to take picture ambil gambar aesthetic the environment elements
that's why I go that's why I go eighty two punya ni like

in the future I don't know what I want to be I don't know what I want to like what I'm interested in and all so macam like err kadangkala also macam keliru like I know what to do so macam I guess I want to find like something that
because I feel like I I like to try like a lot of things so macam

the tulang place nearby lah there's another tulang place lah
just go there because I was alamak I was so like not so clever move lah cause I was wearing white right then I eat tulang alamak it was like alamak disaster
ya so the the tulang experience wasn't so enjoyable because you know
dia ada ni lah dia ada apa ada macam titik sikit lah
not bukan macam like yang splash it was
err tulang dropped then there was a splash and I thought it was gone but okay lah but everybody is stained lah just now everybody have err something to remember ya ya
so is very evident lah that everybody ate tulang right so

the youngest one also is like what twenty one this this sunday eh this weekend besok ah dia punya birthday
panggil family come eat she cook
balik time ah balik fetch her tuition
anyways uh ya you were saying apa tadi afikah pasal
something about because the way the way they how her work is like she got dia ada macam beberapa sample gitu
because in her team kan ada macam leader tau
so leader leader nak kena macam like
err macam leader macam uh if got macam the night shift people right never finish right the sample so leader need to come in earlier lah
so if this is a macam leader punya role lah
so tapi macam this leader there's no everybody got same pay but like you in charge ah you team leader
so they cakap lah got one one time tu
eh dia cakap dia she was in the toilet sekali ada this leader
ah and another girl inside the cubicle don't know then was talking ah talking talking like the leader say ya I want to leave ah like macam like you know
so diorang cakap then the other lady was saying like err eh then you leave then how ah
cause is like err say I also new say dia cakap like you know why they want to like you know ask me be leader because her partner that is uh this indian lady lah older than her like master degree and all
but tapi dia macam I think the quiet type lah you know and like she like so many years been housewife never work
oh okay but but I think also based on what she like say her other colleague pun macam like eh
like maybe those like not not not so vocal very dominant one like you know talk softly maybe you know so tak maybe ya I don't know maybe tak
tak stand out properly I think ya
ya but it's it's ya but I think I think I tell her okay apa like you know at least you know the next job
ya ya actually but I tell her it's good what kita nak orang orang ya that's why
so what was the painting yang painting tu dekat mana
ya so so what's what's what's going on dekat apa gillman baracks is that ah is there anything going on there and when the last time we went there for exhibition right
eh apa tadi
tiba-tiba ah
the first his car tu apa
more than she did that then what's that just now she called me then dia cakap dia nak apa go vivian house tomorrow
ada jer
mangsa dia kan
dah habis eh
okay so nanti next next friday dah decided where to eat
tapi I think dia macam macam weird leh
cause senang lah you are you're opening a restaurant and you are using my name eh
you know eh kau aku one thing then you use my name
oh she came ah tadi
okay habis so sekarang dia tak laptop ke macam mana
eh ya you say you want to have like nak advertise what paid by
so hari ni siapa buat all these err like math questions
there's time for solat there's time to bath there's time to eat
yang first paragraph tu nak kena bagus lah
that's why I was eh ya ada eh accountant
but last time was like very far because apa eh dia macam english camp gitu ah
go this camp ah and like dia ajar dia ada macam
err I think ada video let him talk then he see himself
I think last time eh ada tau macam Mendaki Mendaki macam apa
macam like err after kind and then like
that kind got cedar girls tapi ada ah macam all that ada
macam really smart smart student one ah ah ya lah for sure
tapi ada juga ya some some of them is nice ah nice like talk normally some of them also like a bit weird you know
like macam
then ah think we were int the room then I don't know what's wrong with that guy makan pun nak tidur
then the aircon have to be like super blast one ah then quite sejuk
some Mendaki camp right so we had like solat all that lah
you know they need to pay tahu tak I think tak payah
I don't think I think I go there by self I go there myself I come back pun myself
that one ya uh tapi he buy like those like
nak buat apa sia ni buat apa
tak ingat ah siapa
so tu dia orang lah
ni apa ni ni kira apa ni Facebook ah
ya lah dengar baik dengar they they say that now
err apa eh get the sebab like
like your parents punya house probably yes maybe back then it was like that right now you know maybe things have changed
so tanya ah your mum macam mana
eh tapi you not there what you should be there I think you should be around ah like to hear like you know that time you were around right mencari sales whatever whatever right
ya ya what I'm saying I'm I'm not you know I think the first step what I'm interested in is to know whether the view has changed or not from the last meeting until now whether they are dah tukar ke belum
kalau dia dah tukar what is changed you know
ya ya then from there then she cuma
mm so I think what you are concerned that one dah macam like stage three stage four lah to sell like how to like
now is number one kita nak tahu whether boleh
ya boleh boleh jual ke tak boleh jual kita belief that can jual also is is it really makes sense to jual
then if jual already then after that then
and like decide on what to do kalau it's not doesn't really make sense to sell then why you want to sell right
semalam ada dengar yang pasal news yang I think there is another three families yang dia cakap
yang geylang lorong something ya ya ya ya
macam macam weird ah I don't know whether it's an old
family ke apa ke kan
lah this one I just knew like here dengar dekat radio jer
so tinggal lagi berapa minit you cakap tadi berapa minit
besok confirm aku nak kena like
oh dia apa cakap-cakap oo buat dia cakap apa err
kita talk ah I see
si liza left already then talk take another friend
tak ada lah not confidential just talk about family lah family macam gitu
tapi dah cakap like
tak tahu asal lah dia cakap dia oh
sha sha rambut dah putih like I think she he like she got a lot of white hair so is like like what
I got here like thirty minutes lah cause you know ah the train ah super late ah I really hate it you know the aunty mak cik all very irritating
tak lah kau gila punya jauh aku kalau boleh nak naik Grab but I didn't take Grab either no lah I very very everything I just take train or Grab but that time Grab is expensive ah so cannot lah okay I no more money already
eh you text me just now you say kau cakap kau ada mimpi eh
walao eh sakit sia
oh got saga just sambung ah walao eh then the then the second dream whose inside the dream
then the baby like what how she look like is she naughty dia baik ke dia macam
ya lor so macam like got the happy ending lah
ya but so many signs eh already like before sebelum ni pun macam like kau dah ada mimpi-mimpi right like all this type of dreams
so okay my intention is that ah aku nak cakap dengan engkau dulu the dream then after that both of us can like um
but like ten years ago how how umur kau berapa ten years ago
eighteen siapa kau dengan siapa ah masih dengan azee
so enam belas tahun kau tahu lah kan sec four eh ah sec four pun nak cakap apa sia dengan diri aku
dah happening ah actually dok aku sec four pasal aku dah jumpa julie semua apa
aku rasa macam aku wild cause uh I met him towards the end of my sixteen so means aku dah habis A-levels ah
so then ah hakim and I we started meeting and then he taught me how to longboard then we went to gigs but it's like going out with him is very decent like you know macam not say abang lah but he's
longboard I even worked with him at his Sakura part time until the following year uh seventeen years old I I masuk
uh and I hope that you're still friends with hakim which I still am alhamdulillah
our english always berterabur sis
tapi memang irritating ah kan
umur dia berapa macam oh
is she like really obvious that she didn't see you or dia just buat buat tak nampak
ah seh so no I'm like okay I like definitely if you ask me now I don't think there's anything that can make me dislike a person but if I try to backward backward like zaman I more impulsive and reckless
macam kita cakap macam condescending like like kita ni macam bodoh like that then ya lah then macam okay oh oh okay this one is the pettiest reason
because he tegur ah so it make me not like him so it's a petty reason lah
ya lah ya lah it's like okay but then again because the way they tegur ah it's like really kurang ajar also
but there is ways for you to like kejutkan orang you know this engineer ah will really scream at your face yell at your face one leh like like no cara tak ada cara aku aku macam nak sepak muka dia but then
masa kat kerja right tak boleh buat apa-apa so okay lah just terima seadanya jer lah
oh ya I think kau pernah bilang dengan aku ini
she's so weird because pasal kau dengan dia macam tak ada kena mengena gitu
like and then like my friend happens to be that conversation so she she told me then di belakang aku padahalnya macam
she's like kau tahu yang ni tak suka kau then aku macam apasal
she then like I was really shocked lah cause aku really like pandang dia macam sister ah but then like
and then I'm like when I heard that I was like kesian or what like you think your tits are the selling point ah bro
ya and it's like very macam
rabak ah like eh aku oval tak tahu merah ke tak sial bising sial aku oval ha walao eh
then I ask lah who is this girl then he told me then I know that girl what she's my ex-classmate then I then I then aku naive ah habis aku cakap dengan dia ah like
like you you stupid or what she's not lesbian I know lah she's my classmate dia dulu like always
stupid sia you just so stupid like you're so stupid like perangai jantan kebrek punya macam like oh you are les let me turn you straight like you don't try to be some hero and in fact she's the one who manipulated you
so ya lah but I never confronted after her her after that but if I everytime I saw her at school I will just like jeling her so hard and like actually uh like I'm not the type to
hate on girls or are like macam be enemies with them but wow what she did was something so nasty and like even if she never did it to me right let's say she did the whole thing to another person I would still feel so turned off
I know lah like okay your self esteem probably like jatuh because you know all the guys like went to me like I don't blame you for that but for you to take vengeance that way is so dirty and nasty sia
ya babe kau tak payah cakap babe ex aku dia nombor satu babe dia kalau buat benda dia fikir pakai konek jer dulu sebelum apa-apa babe
bodoh sia
I think it's just more to me it comes off to me like wah aku tak tahu ada manusia macam gini macam that can do that to someone else not that I was so hurt by it but I'm just like so
apa babe
ya that's so awesome nanti kalau kau pergi travel settle sia
oh ya and like baca quran and also kau faham
I'm not surprised that you want that because aku macam pernah nampak kau like one like being handy like remember that that that thing jatuh kat toilet
like ah but it's not because I will learn cooking eventually but it will be like beginner level so if I could take one skill that's immediate like chef level mak aku punya level I will take cooking
aku tahu berenang ah but I pun tak pernah masuk dalam ah berenang aku tahu pasal kat secondary school kita belajar
eh float dah okay sia some people don't even know how to float which I teach them also ah sometimes
but ya I would learn how to sea dive actually it's a very ah actually cooking and sea diving I feel is very doable lah can so ya but if I could choose it right now aku terus tahu it's sea diving ah
kau bayar setakat berapa hundred dollars then kau dapat can do sea diving cuma kat singapore nothing to sea dive ah so you have to overseas ah
so third skill if I could pick up okay ah kalau nak cakap nyanyi nyanyi is more of like a natural born lah so tak boleh ah kan
can ke oh kena vocal coaching
ya ah like okay some people macam like born with it like dah bagus but ya there's many cases dia orang macam vocal coaching right
right is the vocal coach yang kau tengok kat YouTube tristan is it
ah I always watch tristan correct and then his recent videos james charles nyanyi dia sedap sia ya it's nice
rabak sial babe
suddenly aku suddenly aku punya spike up banyak apasal
kau can think out of the box kau boleh ambil orang err orang korea orang jepun orang malaysia orang indonesia it's up to kau lor
so you wake up you look at the cermin and then you'll be like oh be that man be like ya sia then eyebrows I've dark eyebrows
but you know kau tahu ah dia kena bahan rabak kan kau tak tahu eh rabak
dia actually from season tak dia tak kena bahang umbrella academy umbrella academy does a great job ya kat luar because
kau faham tak he's young like no lah macam like booboos like err macam on Instagram live macam macam macam acting weird acting macam socially awkward
but I guess the ones who's making fun of him are also about that age ah macam thirteen sia so ya but then it's a lot of them so they really bahang kan him lah ya
but you know goodness kau tu belum lagi nampak
ada satu video dia nyanyi kat Instagram live memang kelakar ah dia macam nyanyi yang yang love yang love love tu but that is not so rabak also
correct cause we're like dude oh wait kita lagi rabak daripada dia kan okay we couldn't even act back then
rabak ah uh correct but then I think after season two ah umbrella academy kan
macam this season dia orang lagi banyak scenes kan and like boleh cakap he bawa the whole show on his back
so it's like even though like the bahang still exist but uh I think a lot of people are giving him acknowledgement and credit that he deserve ah for season two
padahal dia orang tunjuk pun macam the videos of him being socially awkward with his fans online pun macam pada aku like normal seh like it's just like macam
dia macam okay he has a sort of personality lah which is a bit quirky but if we see it as quirky then you will understand why his awkward not as
it can be anything from audio err to like macam you doing cartoon and then he will showcase it and bring it forward to the world you know
like ya that's why uh recently if you saw dia macam post something like hey someone in malaysia can you guys um
err say a a poem a puisi in malay err so that aku like so that dia boleh
wife dia is a like a like a brilliant also like she's some ah president for like an kind of company so
personal life cause I was a fan I was a very huge fan of johnny depp when I was in my teenage years all so aku
okay dia tak resist to adopt like so many kids from different parts of the world
and it takes two hands to clap also and also like I think the relationship between brad pitt and angelina tu pun macam dysfunctioning at that point of time like because brad pitt did come up of thing to be saying that
jennifer still wanted to have fun macam you know they were they were high they were taking weed
and then like when I see her older videos when she was younger right when she was like gila gila
macam you go out you go out of the house and then like so many girls
you can speak korean because that's the body's ability but then nanti ada orang melayu macam ah
aku faham sia dia cakap habis apa macam tapi how you learn that sia
ah ya ya tak payah pergi kerja so there's no nothing like you there's no transaction to get something or whatever so basically right maybe you can imagine the world in a in a more messed up way
like macam dah macam end of times ah tak ada kerja langsung ah macam so macam purge ke apa macam
it could be looked both ways it could be either super peaceful or either rabak it depends on the community I think
huh macam mana kau nak beli benda ya correct
jangan kau messed up dangut sudah sia you need this you
I feel like ya I feel like ya I feel like Netflix should do like a seh can just do a whole show based on this question alone like macam imagine kan
tak pernah ah singapore in general babe
dah banyak benda kita tak dia orang tak buat major it's so boring sia
but ya like the macam
imagine if they did something more non realistic like not family drama and like macam just you know
ah like that's why Netflix shows always make it what right because the umbrella academy is not going to happen in real life like ya apocalypse ini semua
okay definitely cannot be macam a one time hit thing pasal singapore satu
satu island dah jatuh babe ya dia kena macam sikit sikit sikit lah
but I think kalau macam there was like maybe a five episode show ah apocalypse in singapore kan
comedic like from there you know indian to the chinese to the malay then campur them together eh ya sia bro rabak already sia bro
same government and then like suddenly like everybody aunty uncle mak cik all united
oh he want to it could be anything lah ya like you said because global warming ah then you know factory they campak here campak there barang so like
so like using bandages lah obviously if you want to talk the islamic context we already know so we take that away this one is imagination is um ya I will just imagine that one person kena sakit
sakit then lepas tu um
ah dia sakit biasa habis dia dah mati tu kan doctor tu macam nak tengah nak tutup dia habis tu doctor tu sakit but from just sending tahu
then the doctor cough at the wife when he come back home then the wife sakit then the sakit she becomes the first zombie
then maybe we can place this selalu always the lah dapat all this kind of thing korea also already let's put this at malaysia very close home
so ya lah so then it starts from there then then you know malaysia people quite degil right they still want to surau they still want to solat at the masjid so they go and then orang masjid pula kena
gigit zombie and then very close to oh but then singapore is kiasu huh so from the first time we hear the one
person already kena then we already cut the borders so it's quite safe ya we already like
dian kuai dian</mandarin one like very cut that bridge ataupun ya correct
because tak boleh already sia kau tahu kalau macam zombie yang macam macam itu besar boleh lari punya habis sial dia lari sudah sampai dah so we have to like they have to
ya okay if they could if they could swim ah you know how singapura last time the history how we put the
you know the tajam-tajam that we couldn't let the sea the the ikan yang macam panjang ah correct
so we will go back to history and we'll do that so the cannot wah then like ya orang singapore will like train each other like macam
and we're like somehow tercampak from everyone else besides like err indonesia so ya but then this will
so bird flu semua we used to have bird flu lah swine flu lah banyak lah seh mad cow disease
ya macam case macam chronic gila macam kau once flu okay this person is going to die in two days
actually a lot of things sia anything if you do it repetitive for eight hours macam boleh merana sia
so imagine kalau kau brush your teeth it's a normal act tapi imagine you have to do it eight hours
gum kau dah dah dah dah dah sah dah sah dah kau dah over
ya so actually anything could be err ni kalau tapi exercise
cuma only maybe tengok ah it won't be a torture
pasal kau boleh tukar banyak channel kan kesian ah aku kat rumah
ya tak lah pasal kalau kau tengok different different cerita lain ah okay ah kalau kalau kau tengok the same show for eight hour then ya maybe ah
but then if like because kalau tengok ah cerita like err in general for eight hours it's not even like torture it's like it's what we do on like rest days like
ya unless your eating is like macam you can choose what you want to eat so maybe like eat sikit-sikit but
the real torture is like the person gave you nasi ayam okay you need to eat this nasi ayam for the next eight hours repetitively
orang boleh mati sia from exhaustion exhaustion exhaustion what other everyday activity that you wouldn't think is a torture but it's a torture if you do it for eight hours
I think washing your face like washing your face with a facial scrub lapan jam straight
kau punya kulit boleh dry sia
oh my god rabak gila actually anything that you do to do your body for eight hours ah
sometimes he dust it at eight hours so he thinks eight hours always like that now penat aku like clean the like you know he do the whole thing
I think ah ya I don't know why I thought of brushing teeth straightaway that's like ugh eight hours sakit sia gigi aku
teruk sia
aku macam ada high pitch moment uh bila excited macam ni so ya
apa sia
if it's for yourself macam
ya macam I
ya kau pernah other vulnerable component like you just you know I want to go on current god do you like the how is it whatever the I I also have
oh ya kau pernah like dengar kawan kawan kau ada third eye how is it for them like I I also have
ah of course wei menyusahkan sia
correct I but I don't know whether they can choose that option to tutup that batin I think
I think they maybe can but cannot go to bomoh lah go to an ustaz or something lah a skilled ustaz
I also have like my friend's friend ah dia pun boleh nampak benda so macam
it's not everytime akan ada benda but macam sometimes ah so macam tengah lepak ataupun
lepak kat luar pun nanti dia cakap eh ada benda ah kat situ ah atau dalam bilik macam alamak ada benda kat sini ah
are they constant tu or are they consistent
oh they want to scare you sia basically dah tak sui ah sis
oh I know him sia nak saja takutkan ni
ya ya boyfriend mana ni
oh I hate that everytime I ask about that ex you tak even refer nama dia kau just panggil dia misai
and I hate also that aku boleh macam oh ya as
though you only have one ex with one misai but
because his misai was the most evident ya
kau follow dia dekat social media ke tak
okay ada low key ah alright
okay so for me my unusual super power apa sia
I think ah the super power that siapa that
for like betul-betul like for bad people then like macam let's say this bad person was going to kill someone then
she can whisper them like macam you are not going to this you are going to try and believe in yourself you know
use it for really so the person that has that power has such as strong responsibility not to misuse it tau not for herself
like but we cannot macam do it for them as in for example a guy who is immature right we cannot be like
macam cheat code ah macam they don't go through the process so it's more like you are going to start going therapy
but then macam
and also macam I I get it like I also wouldn't want my partner to be misusing it on my child but
so ya but I mean it is messed up but messed up to a point that nak sampai divorce semua macam
chill lah like sort of like she rumour you tak berapa baik lah
kau ingat yang the part where ellen page pergi slice the car
ya ya ya but it's so kesian in the season two end up she never use but her husband irritating
kau just enjoy dia punya power habis kau nak use it the definition of toxic men sia babe aku throughout the movie aku just like
like get go I was trying to obviously give him the benefit of the doubt lah kan pasal dia macam
this like heroic black man but then as we go go through macam and he's not
luther sia aku prefer bluther with allison even though in the first season I was like meh but
dia tu baru cakap kau sayang citizen kau
yes one room flat but then nak kena ada conditions to pass lah so you must like graduate ini semua okay so if you haven't met that those conditions you still live with your parents
but then if you still haven't met that conditions then it's either kau can get the twenty one year old house ataupun stay with your parents
and then the last will be thirty years old which is like a five room flat because nanti kan semua dah ada anak semua apa
so it's all government dah macam plan untuk kau orang
and it's not like semua dapat what it's like there's conditions what so it's also it makes sense what right
ya that's why ya the ration is over there because the thing is with food is free obviously orang yang tak tamak okay lah kan
tapi kau imagine lah orang yang kau tahu kau tahu yang macam dah suka belum apa-apa dah pergi hog semua exactly kau imagine
ya takkan dia sapu
ya no food I think food can't be free I think if I really want one food that is free ah one thing that is free is ah ni sanitary pad
but condoms mana satu pun orang kasi free free per
so anyway uh babe uh kau wish aku lah ah untuk interview aku
eh babe thanks ah pasal kau macam berbual dengan aku semua so aku dah have a gauge
it should be confirmed agaknya petang tengok macam mana err
kalau tak ada apa-apa aral I go down ah
top up apa-apa yang patut ah see whether they I think so lah they might need lah dah almost two weeks

cause it was such a long time just to choose which err apa
everything dah siap
later dekat waterway point I need to collect my stuff from her
then I have my all the two tudung
it thinks it easy but it's not I'm so busy with so many things so many things coming up my kacang having promo

yes we're planning to meet up for another another time once the teachers dah school holiday because semalam um haidar and ida still cannot make it their dia orang ada class eh bukan kelas dia orang ada um jumpa parent jumpa mak bapa
ourselves you guys only need to go out at night for teh mummies need to go out for lunch

K never mind like I dekat I I can't recall
it's so leceh
malas lah nak buat zoom zoom ni I'm not comfortable lah nanti
nanti I keep looking at the teacher while I dah tak tahu nak tanya apa lagi dekat teacher nadia
just like sad that her malay teacher tu
cikgu melayu dia cikgu hafizah dah tak ada ah
err cikgu suhanis is there lah definitely she's
but I believe cikgu iza will still teach the lower lower primary because that's how he can
like one of the parents was mentioning the other day I say cikgu suhanis is a good starting point for kids to understand malay and then cikgu iza make it more interesting
when nadia is in P three err cikgu hafiza she's lucky because she knows cikgu hafiza even before she started
ah teaching her so cikgu hafiza already know what kind of students she is how how she is how determined she is when she want something
when when the teacher she tak suka
see like the I mean not apa
um dia punya prefect punya tu
because of COVID then she cannot join her dance eh her dance I think if she started she would enjoy it like how her kakak
at least she got two to her ni to her name
ya dia suka panjat-panjat pe banyak pe they go hiking and everything but then sekarang
she's the one yang climbing all over the place
tak boleh loose out ke dia
dia takleh kalah you understand or not
that's why dia main game dia tak boleh kalah dia nak menang jer tapi I think dah I rasa dah better lah sekarang dia dah dah dah boleh lah dulu tak boleh kalah dulu macam iman main nak menang
then you nak nanti settle the boys
I don't know if see kalau tak sempat masak
macam penat lah nak masak ini hari I tak tahu nak masak apa
nanti you just get
but I think it sounds better to last night I think I didn't hear sangat
semalam I think dah kurang ah
nasib nasib baik dia orang suka minum they they dia orang minum air putih
I think she's coming from sengkang I don't know whether she's bringing her son along later si mas ni
they've prepared so much so half a year later baru dah towards the end nak nak nak dah tak tak tak kecoh sangat
kalau tak nanti kelam kabut because kalau you start only in in in P six there's too many things to catch up
because the thing is for me dia punya the the the problem sum lah
baik lah as long as it's not so expensive lah but I think this teachers are
okay boleh
okay lah boleh
ah next time me parents gateway you kena cepat-cepat kasi I tau
parents gateway punya details nanti kalau you dah start kerja I tak tahu apa-apa seh
the cikgu I mean the the and tasha tasha's teachers are using class dojo
like your what like what your sister was mentioning lah during this COVID it's best that they don't change classes because it's easier for contact tracing it's easier lah they don't want to ignore it because if not you have to go back and change back then the thing is our the girl also pun what like like tasha they she still moved around to
err this kind of thing you have to macam mak bapa ah then sometimes they will advise biasa ah macam orang tua they have their preferred um preferred kadi of choice macam they dorang have gone to more weddings that we have
then so they have attended more of the ceremony so sometimes they like the they prefer tak ah kadi ni lagi bagus kadi ni lagi dia macam lagi ah lembut cara dia berbual that kind of thing lah so so usually how it works is that once five months prior five month is it five months ya five months prior to your wedding err you go online then your date your wedding date will be available
when once your date your date is available on on the website then you err boleh book ah then when you go in when you go into the website you can there will be a list of kadi available then all the kadi then they also show like where the kadi lives I think or where they the area where they prefer to where is most comfortable for them lah basically ya
can yes no problem ya ya there's no problem with that basically the the way they they put it is that because some people prefer macam oh takut kadi err they wanted for morning morning wedding kan so dorangnya ceremony for the nikah pagi so dorang tak nak macam kadi takut jam so kalau katakan they wanted to have a eight
um ceremony kan then after that oh nine ceremony then katakan they scared oh if the kadi tinggal pasir ris then my ceremony is in jurong dorang takut kadi datang jam you know that kind of thing so sometimes people prefer if they don't have as a preferred err they don't have a preferred err kadi sometimes they prefer to choose someone that lives nearby ah so so that that's how some people choose that's why the the where the kadi punya tak
look at the kadi available
then after that ya you can you can just look at the list of kadi available you just choose ah say your wedding date is in in two months time then you go in and you see all the kadi who are available then you just screenshot then you ask both sides whether okay I choose this one you okay you okay okay both sides okay then after that dah then you can boleh masuk and book the once your date is available you can go and book lah
ya so what I did what I did previously was I went into website than I went to check out the kadi available
and then after that macam
ya cause I don't want to like miss out on the kadi that I want but eventually on that day itself my kadi was busy so I got the I got his back up ya
err for me is I I think I did it at one on the day that it was available ya ya I I err you can ask lina for it when it comes to this kind of things a bit macam tak sabar everything I I prefer to do everything early rather than than than late ya correct
is it kadi kadi I think there's only three or four
then everything else is naib kadi ya
ni wali punya thing
I don't think anybody does any kadi reviews last time of course lah ya
mmhmm ya you don't want to you don't want to macam yang draggy draggy until macam kasi trauma that kind of thing kan
mm sometimes they they they they they drag all the ceremony and everything like then like the thing is like if like I I understand cause kadang-kadang macam the orang yang datang tak semua islam
you know kan that's that's one thing that for me also cause macam my groomsmen I have about four who are non-muslim so like if you were to have a extended err nikah ceremony with all the dua and everything with all the ceramah everything and then it makes it uncomfortable for some of them lah
ya you need like sometimes you want a a good kadi but then sometimes you don't want someone who
I think I think the okay when it comes to kadi they you won't get in contact with them directly with the person that you choose directly until probably one week before
put yourself in their shoes lah macam dorang
setiap minggu ada nikah to do
they will message you and then he will they usually the kadi will will for what happened to me was he he created a group a WhatsApp group chat
why he did that was basically just to macam ingatkan err remind you to bawa your err bawa then documents that you need to bring lah basically and then um some time then err he will contact me or give you a he contacted me via WhatsApp lah he ask me whether I knew what to say and everything then for me I told him I um
I told him I wasn't he ask me whatever I was nervous and whether I know what to say lah then I say tak ah err banyak members dah kahwin then I used to be I I'm their their groomsman and everything so macam apa nak cakap and everything all I got it down lah
no need to worry but for some of my friends some kadi will give you a call the night before then ask you to practise on the phone
ya ke but like what I say when it when it happens to me I think I think you you remember I forgot that there was a reading part
they have to read that the the the script ah err post post nikah ya ya no stress also ya but when I read cause I'm I'm I I I I'm not very fluent in in err like when when you're supposed to talk in an extended malay or read an extended malay I I tend to fall back to baku ya I I cause we all we all grew up you know secondary school macam kau primary school your oral have to be baku kan ya exactly
okay so the initial the initial kadi that we chose um on that day he was unable one month before he said he was unable to come on that weekend because he was he had a family gathering family event so he said he asked his best friend or his his colleague lah basically to take over so that colleague was there was when that colleague contacted me two weeks before
ya I've not met that guy before lah basically ya ya the kadi before but basically then he just give me a call and then ya um but when it comes to your situation itself right once you book the kadi that you want and then set a date with
then turun ah turun err on whichever date that err you guys have agreed upon and during the interview itself then you can tell the kadi ah macam oh err tunang saya bapa bukan islam then dia tanya like things of like how what is what's err um lah what what you do you need to do what are the things that needs to be covered during the ceremony to make it legit lah basically ya
I wanted to get the kadi that I want cause that's one that my dad ask me to get right so
I didn't want to get that time slot lose out that time slot for that one kadi that I wanted so I went in and then went to fill up the whole form then after that macam
cause I wanted I want to to know what I need ready ya so macam on the day itself if you need to do then oh semua dah siap
um I would say a lot of people nikah on saturday
a lot of people actually nikah on saturday and then wedding on sunday as in the typical if you want to talk about the people who do separate err double weddings I mean now is different but but
when my friends all got married previously all a lot of them got married nikah on a saturday and then wedding on a sunday ya
nak kena faham I mean from their point of view is necessary lah for people to for couples to be macam err ready I mean all these is like err basic rumahtangga punya knowledge ah right for them to know about like some of my friends went and then they talk about how to manage your finance as a couple what
um civics you know like to for you to understand like oh if I do this what my in-laws think you know that kind of thing if I if I handle money this way what would my wife think that kind of thing lah ya it it it's it's it's more of that and then they have a lot of macam very open conversations lah but I find it a waste of time for me personally
is not with the is not you don't interview with your kadi ya you do with with err the the head kadi who is in charge of everyone so he will interview every single person
and the wakil from the bride
as in not not necessarily wakil lah as in just a representative for the girl side
so for me is I I brought mak ah
I mean like it will be better lah right like you don't need to be it doesn't need to be a guy cause I brought mak so ya
ya ya so that's the one where they will interview basically I guess the point of the interview is to see whether macam
whether it's a forced marriage you know that kind of thing ya so he went on to say like are you willing like is this out of willingness what's the purpose of you getting married you know the kind of thing ya err then he banyak soalan juga they will you're in there for about ten fifteen minutes I would say at least
you don't really you don't have a conversation with kadi until like two weeks before your wedding
the head of the guy who is in charge of all the kadi
that is after so so basically okay once you reach you have to do registration and everything kan submit your papers then they will give you a queue number then once your queue number is ready you go inside this room and then this room is where the the head of err the the ustaz is there lah he will question you some questions whether are you born muslim I think that's a that kind of things lah I think those those those are some of the questions that he asked and lepas tu
I think he asked mak some questions then ask lina some questions and then
once it's all that okay and then ya then you go out when you are leaving the room and there will be like two kakak there will be asking you macam awak awak kahwin kahwin kita ada marriage prep ni eh err apa for you to go and then you like oh and alamak ni saya bila lah then for me right what happened to me was like dorang cakap ni awak dengan tunang awak boleh sign up ni bagus tau macam very informative and everything lah they were saying all the like like they a give long speech about it I said I'm too busy ah so then after that then they will shut up
cause I got a few friends who went a lot a few or no no no you very long time ago ya I I thought it's quite recent also until my colleague she say aku dah kahwin lima belas tahun tak pernah pergi ah that's why I thought was compulsory I think is just a exactly so I I think right is all macam a propaganda kind of thing like semua kena pergi you know like kind of thing kena pergi like you know how how the the language malay the malay language is like that where they want you to like you should go they would use the word kena you know is like kau kena pergi
ah you know like like cause like typical err like pasar melayu they will like say eh kau kena pergi tau ni
but the in malay is both we will usually use the word kena anyway ya so I think that's how it it spiral out of control then make a lot people think is compulsory but the thing is it has never been compulsory because it's not part of of err islamic laws what for you to to go through a course
ya so I did I cause when when it when when it came to my marriage I told alina macam I want to cut out all a lot of the non compulsory things in in our marriage lah I mean to cut down all the cost lah basically like I was telling things things like like dulang it's not compulsory you know things like that then um a lot of the other things lah like red wedding cake lah the kompang lah all this kind of thing all not compulsory no didn't have wedding cake
semua orang duduk kan and semua orang boleh tengok macam oh dia tengah potong cake err
you know but if you have a typical wedding macam kita semua macam orang semua tengah ambil makan buffet kan dorang jalan ambil makan everything kan a lot of the times my friend potong cake orang kat belakang tak tahu then like for me is that okay for some of them it all depends like I said it all depends on the couple lah some couples
is a is a western is a western tradition ya so some people some people say oh I don't cut for everybody to say I cut for me and my wife for that special moment I get it macam okay aku faham but for some people they want to make sure that all the guest see you know macam if you are if you are the kind of person that you want to have a wedding cake and you want everyone to see cause your wedding cakes are not going to be cheap
ya cause they know I I am degil usually lah when it comes to malay weddings right a lot of the time more often than not the dia punya mak andam suka control
mak andam is the the the the bride's err makeup artist lah ya okay but when it comes to makeup artist is different leh like lina makeup artist makeup jalan mak andam is the kind who will stick with the bride the whole day that kind so a lot of the my colleagues at my my friend my wife err one of them pakai scarf so the whole day the mak andam there betulkan scarf dia then the other one err what's that called makeup then everything betulkan makeup dia everything kan so
so then the groom's side don't have pak andam err I don't know I think it's called pak andam ya they now now nowadays they have nowadays they they insist
some of them insist then because yes correct so um the the girl the they they rent the baju kan they rent the baju then they would they kain samping they ask pak andam it's all part of money making process lah
err a lot a lot of times twice I had I met with the same mak andam
cause people you know like oh ni mak andam aku bagus tau you know your makeup dia baik then they they the same cause it's all within the same clique of friends one then always the same mak andam cause they will try to macam
you understand where they're coming from in a sense of that macam aku aku need satu jam nak tukar outfit untuk err pengantin perempuan nak kena satu jam satu jam setengah tukar rambut dia nak buka nak tukar makeup dia tukar baju dia one and half hour so they always try to dig out as much time as possible so katakan all weddings eh
ya whole day so we so basically katakan lepas nikah you plan in your itinerary habis nikah pukul lapan setengah err let's say sebelas setengah your habis nikah sebelas setengah right but then you think is sebelas setengah habis err pukul dua belas tukar baju for the next half I can bet with you sebelas setengah nikah belum habis
ceremony nikah might be finished might finish at eleven thirty but the time gone macam nangis-nangis salam-salam salam-salam ambil gambar ambil gambar eh dah pukul dua belas
then like shit I need to go to the room then you will you really lose let's say you lose fifteen minutes here then you every every every other things right you will lose fifteen minutes fifteen minutes ya you want to walk to the room or you want to walk out with orang nak ambil gambar every take one picture one picture one picture you know the kind of thing right and then you no matter what every wedding there will be delays
so that's the thing macam semua semua tak pernah I went to any wedding where is macam on on the dot so it's it's impossible like there's no point of you macam oh eleven O five you come here like no point lah you want to
plus minus fifteen minutes is not bad lah you don't you don't macam because I've I've a friend who actually plan eleven O five kita turun bawah eleven ten must be down here eleven fifteen we move off then I'm like bro by the time we move off twelve o'clock
ya like you for the purpose for all those you must be a bit flexible with your timing that's one thing and then and on top of that you must know mak andam suka macam they know this cause they they do weddings is their is their living is their work right ya bread and butter they know how it works so they will always try to selit as much time as possible so for example
for me ah I scold my friends mak andam a lot of times already like like I met her I everytime I scold her because she I know what she's doing as she also know what I'm doing ah cause basically like say for my friend right
dia nikah kat masjid then lepas nikah ambil gambar ambil gambar ambil gambar
then after that they said okay we're going to change location to the they did kat simei yang makan kat sana lepas tu kat masjid dorang to move off they want to move off then after that err I'm supposed to move off at err twelve o'clock so
so got one and half hours but then now is twelve fifteen eh no no now is eleven err at that point of time when it happened it was eleven thirty ke eleven forty five around there
then after that she went err she she went to tell the groom's mum cause that the nikah kat masjid is the groom's side
the makan at simei is the girl is the bride side so he told the grooms she told the groom's mum kita nak kena jalan sekarang tau then the groom's mum err tapi pengantin belum makan tau
belum makan eh lepas nikah everything ambil gambar ambil gambar belum makan pengantin belum makan then she said err takpe lah nanti dorang tukar baju kat sana nanti ada makan juga pe
exactly right so I knew how he's going to be pissed so I told I told I told her I told her no no no no no no kita pengantin makan then I told my friends to go and siapkan the food
she went behind my back again she tell the mak the mak err pengantin both sides eh err tak payah makan eh kita makan kat sana jer eh she thinks she can the parents would override me but because I I knew them since I was young like the my friend's mum knew me since I was wearing shorts in secondary school the that kind of thing like we know each other for for fifteen years that kind already
ya then she she was like err err tak tahu awak tanya salam that kind of thing you know ya so she cause she she know how degil and how angry I can get err so she's like and she know that I I'm the whole itinerary is is run by me so then the mak andam cannot say anything lah she cause she want to turn back err she know what I'm gonna say already
forgo what is the rights of the bride and the groom ah right ah exactly kita dah plan dorang makan apa you want to tell them makan makan ala kadar okay you want to tell them don't eat you go ahead you go to hell ya so that at that point I I she sit at the at the pengantin table then she sitting down there
tak payah tak payah tak payah like I no lah awak diri awak diri jalan jalan jalan ya exactly no but some people are pushovers so she would win when people are like okay lah okay lah you know
now is eleven thirty eleven forty five we need to go eleven thirty dorang belum start makan tau that in her mind by the time dorang start makan by the time dah gini gini aku tak ada time nak betulkan rambut si dia ni that's how she's thinking yes but for me is like
jangan kau tak payah kesah kalau you if you need two hours you will get your two hours that's that's my point like if the bride and groom are supposed to walk in at two on that side what's the difference with two thirty
you know but you cannot be like one or one and half hours that flexible lah you cannot be that flexible but at the same time that's why you as the macam for me lah as the as the the brides err eh as the best best man I have to macam keep everything running lah ya
ya so those those are the things that for me macam important lah nak kena tahu macam
ya because sometimes like my photographers supposed to be err end one hour earlier but then cause he had one a two hour break in the middle he gi makan prata and everything I told him to go eat prata what ah cause as I say no we we keep we reach we reach the hotel will be late at that time
ya so it's like err suka hati dia nak makan lah he was kat sini ada makan apa eh you are like kau tanya aku kat fort canning mana aku tahu makan apa kau gi makan cari kedai prata
yes okay and on top of that like things like I say ah macam you have to also macam recce how much are they charging you for rental lah because the cost of rental could be a lot more than you making your own baju
ya she for me it's like I gave her like I told her mak andam makeup artist you handle you pay
I told her macam that is all on you
it's not a macam a combined expense like the makeup part is not a combined expense to me so I told her that one if you you find yourself you you going and recce yourself because I cannot tell you macam maybe some makeup artists oh this is hundred dollars that one is two hundred dollars but then the hundred dollar one
but but sometimes you don't know how how how good they are sekali they make you look like a nyonya you know that kind of thing you also don't know ya
mm ya but but like I say these kind of thing suruh dewi pergi Instagram go and stalk people lah
ah you can just search makeup artist or mak andam then you just search search search or you can even when you look for photographer and they will always tag all the people then you go and check oh wah her makeup very nice ah look very natural and you go see oh it's done by this person then you go click her then you go and message ask dewi to message her alina I think messaged like at least five to six people on on Instagram err for for quotations
ya not necessary mak andam would be worth it if you are planning to rent baju I would say
but at the same time sometimes they overcharged because they macam oh because it's err package dengan empat baju cause it's err bride and groom tukar dua kali you know that kind of thing so they got four four sets of baju
but then sometimes like I don't buy like I actually only need the baju kurung you know that kind of thing I don't need the second part second part I got my own err western baju for example kan then you don't need things like that ya
yes then they always have but the thing is sometimes it's it's smart to do it with them because they have all the connection like if you do it with their friend then you can you know like if you do the photographer with this guy with this mak andam then she will give you discounts ah that kind of thing lah ya they all have like their full package
it's up to you I would say okay so that's why okay that's why macam your
if you are planning to do a a photoshoot after are you going to tukar baju from are you going to change outfit or not change outfit that's one thing and if you are going to change outfit and are you going to reapply makeup not reapply makeup
I mean if you want to get just get for her parents and mak then that's it lah for the rest of us all we can can settle ourselves lah
just to put at the front so when during kau nya nikah orang duduk kat depan sana tapi lepas nikah
orang makan dah makan dorang boleh duduk they still have seats to sit around my thinking was after orang makan they can go to the park
at the same time you cannot expect people dah makan jalan ah is okay you also cannot expect dah makan jalan lah you know that kind of thing ah eh kau dah makan angkat pinggan mangkuk jalan lah you cannot do that what right
cause it's a three hour wedding then they also oh might as well aku dah datang pukul sebelas might as well aku datang pukul sepuluh tengok dorang nikah you know that kind of thing ya so ya even the nikah all the chairs all were filled quite full initially I thought is like I ready at ten then I was like wah I didn't expect everybody to reach here by ten
ya nikah it started off with nikah alina seated alina seated already then after that I I just
sit down there ya cause we got no kompang or nothing what
mm ya dah habis ambil gambar kita makan ya
the kalau tak nak stress
let your itinerary be as vague as I won't say as vague as possible lah but pretty flexible for changes like for my for my for my itinerary was nikah
ya so I yes the core concept is there done so anything in between like kau nak ambil gambar ni tak ah boleh ah sembarang
boleh ambil gambar ni boleh sebarang ah like I for me is like for me is like I don't I don't want it to be macam that kind of thing like for me is like I still got time I still got time ya let's go
where the wife is pretty controlling of the entire itinerary the one I told you macam he eleven oh eleven O five we must leave the house eleven ten nak kena ke bawah eleven fifteen you kita jalan then like
takkan jadi during the planning I said exactly who exactly who will follow to the letter and first and foremost you do know that your makeup doesn't take macam you have to tell the makeup oh you have fifteen minutes to put on her makeup there's no way if she needs half an hour she's going take half an hour
ya she don't care she's not going to let you walk out of the room and spoil her reputation you know that kind of thing ya so that's why they're always very pushy in terms of time lah from mak andam we get I get that and everything but the same time macam as a bride and groom to me is like you must be flexible with your time mah you cannot be cannot be very fixated on on oh this needs to be done by this time this need to be done by this time the eventual
the eventual result is that everything needs to end by twelve thirty then that that is your cut off you know dua belas tak boleh ah but anything before that you want to change anything kira for me is like now you can be flexible
and you must also understand macam lepas dah nikah eh nanti ada orang ambil gambar
then nak salam that kind of thing kan and nak orang turun
dua orang gi makan dua orang duduk duduk tengok the tea ceremony
I mean that is considering is still during this period ah I mean yours is going to be five week five months later I don't think it'll be a lot more lepak ah now it's like so strict I've got I went to two weddings no like no no problem
tak no problem ah no problem no problem I think by by by in five months time there shouldn't be a problem lah
you know you you have never there was never been a need for you to pay for someone to me ah especially I mean unless you are during an event a wedding is something intimate now tau macam yang datang members members kau sendiri then macam kalau nak ada bayar I mean you
the emcee the emcee there's no emcee one one of them is just the the they just err okay err dia they just ah okay ah keluarga ni ambil gambar keluarga ni ambil gambar that kind of thing then after that my the my sister-in-law's brother is her uncle okay would like to say thank you for everybody to come gitu gitu just someone to make an announcement that's it ya
I've I've I've always macam felt that
I have never been to a wedding where I'm like eh kau buat apa I'm like I don't know I I talk a lot I will just mix around I'll mix around with everybody or I will just eat my food you know that kind of thing so personally I I I don't I don't feel the need for a emcee lah I've always never listen to a single I usually get irritated by an emcee who talks a lot
you know the emcee who likes to takeover macam oh okay sekarang groom awak jumpa dia macam mana you know that kind of thing like dude dude shut up
ya I don't find it necessary lah I mean unless you what you will have a macam
a company's event and then you want to have a emcee then it it's it's different lah but tak tak macam buang duit ah
ya so so a lot people actually book their photographers and their mak andam and all this kind of thing wedding decor way before they even get their location
to tell you what pose you need to do yes because on that day is first and foremost right you don't want you don't want to be a cliche macam oh semua orang pose macam gini then kau pose macam gini that kind of thing you want someone who's like aku ada idea aku last weekend aku buat macam gini tau kau nak buat macam gini you know that kind of thing then like eh kau ambil gambar macam gini korang geng sekarang in thing in thing orang semua ambil gambar macam gini
yes cause is their job is not you want someone who like does this on the side oh macam okay okay okay ambil gambar okay okay kiri kiri sikit okay okay then all the pictures will be like like you know
ya cause okay like um after the nikah I told alina I don't want to take pictures first lepas habis nikah mak bapa dulu so parents come up here we salam then we get take pictures with anybody but then your aunties came up first
so your aunties err came up first and then err they they came up first then they straight away wanted to take pictures of alina and then after that our photographer macam ya is ya we I understand all this ah they they get super excited ambil gambar dulu cepat before anybody because I heard whatever cause I was standing there
then they say cepat cepat cepat ambil gambar dengan lina dulu
then they all rush and took pictures with her then I was standing there that is not going to with me and her you know is just her so I'm standing there then my photographer then I thought jom ambil gambar
cause I for me is like at the same I want the sequence of the pictures to be macam okay after the ceremony you're gonna take pictures for me err salam parents you know that kind of thing ya then after that then we take picture ya that that's the the steps lah
semuanya okay
oh aku baru balik dari batam meet my family during this COVID lah
some place most of the places is quiet lah some of them err ada yang dah tutup tak ada apa tu business kan some of them close
ah like massage parlours all dah tutup
a lot yang know like people with families lah with families I think affected them a lot orang some of them macam duduk kat kedai kopi hari-hari you know cannot do anything have to wait for this thing to be over kesian
so he dia dah tak dah takde kerja so he buat tu lah parking lah do the parking
tanam sayur kat kat kat apa dekat tu ah dekat tu kat barelang
tanam sayur dapat gaji lah sikit-sikit
ya yang macam kan normally kan over there when you park your car before you move kan ada orang datang they they call it orang tukang parking lah so they jaga to park jaga that parking area parking shift so one day I think the pay is about hundred thousand which is about singapore ten dollars
harvest already then after that jual ah kat pasar okay okay okay then other than that how's how's the the the the mall there the tourists there and the
what do you call it the massage spa abeh shopping centre
huh that means from singapore you have to fly to jakarta first then from jakarta quarantine for one night lepas tu duduk satu malam satu malam naik kapal terbang then pergi batam why never go batam directly from singapore take ferry
okay okay tanah merah because you know just recently I heard I read this news you know this singaporean that have not return back from singapore for seventeen years ah dia cakap macam macam nazi lah macam world war two lah kena halau sana halau sini I not sure whether it's true or not lah but
ah so maybe haven't come singapore seventeen years so he thought like macam nazi lah but so it's just a systematic that you just need to follow the whole sequence and then after that if you have any questions you just ask information lepas tu dia akan bilang mana nak pergi mana nak pergi sana pergi sini probably they are quite busy they are not suppose to talk much for for certain reason ah
ah okay lah because there is also people you know some you know from every you know now social media very strong right some people say stay in the hotel singapore not good and then some request to have balcony some request to have sentosa hotel I don't know lah these people sometimes I thinking if let say you want to prefer all these kind of thing then might as well don't come out from singapore in the beginning ah betul tak then just stay in singapore don't need to come out ya
okay lah alhamdulillah lah at least okay apa at least something kan daripada takde apa-apa then kalau kata orang tu kalau tak nak tak nak tak nak bayar then jangan lah keluar duduk kat singapore jer betul tak
oh abeh sekarang tengah buat apa lepak ah sekarang tak buat apa-apa ah
makan tidur makan tidur terus menjadi tau badan cannot no badan semua menjadi nanti have to go for exercise already have to keep fit already if not ah mati ah then what what what what what you doing later after this
okay lah you are become your own boss what now is your own boss ah err own own job own own money everything your own don't don't need to report to anybody what just report to the money the longer you work you get more money err but kerja kerja kerja sikit dapat sikit kerja banyak dapat banyak okay lah alhamdulillah lah kata orang kan
okay lah you control your own finances lah in a way that you can control your time then kalau ada apa-apa boleh habis siang kalau takde apa-apa boleh kerja lambat sikit so at least in a way
new year tahun ini jawapan dia duduk kat rumah diam-diam makan nasi lemak
betul betul betul I think now I heard this year countdown they won't be doing a main event like how they do previous year because they want to cut down the crowd lah so
apa-apa yang countdown semua dekat neighbourhood estate jer lah
I think I have the feeling that maybe they go by zoning lah macam north east south west ke apa so kat mana-mana yang okay kau tinggal north ada bunga api tinggal south ada bunga api west ada bunga api so instead of going to the central punya bunga api so everybody goes your own division their own area their own kampung to enjoy lah but anyway I mean
singapore bila
sixteen march ke
sixteen march dia orang tutup sixteen march sekali kira march april may june july august september november a'ah betul lah dah sembilan bulan ah
pejam celik pejam celik dah nine months dah nak masuk satu tahun
you no need to take sikit-sikit what what you can do okay because this hundred dollars is given in the denomination of ten but
you have to book through these five different platform okay err yang satu changi and then err I think trip err there's another three more lah aku tak ingat mana satu err then
can you can use hundred dollars full to offset your staycation in a hotel for yourself ah you can use that or you can use partly the only thing yang you cannot do yang kau tak boleh buat is kau buat stack up maknanya aku ada satu ratus kau ada satu ratus then kita combine dua ratus kita stay in hotel for free ah itu tak boleh tapi
kalau let's say that hotel is two hundred dollars but I only use my hundred dollars and then I can uh offset their hundred dollars I only pay four hundred dollars but I cannot stack up if I stack up ah that means I can get you me some other of my friends ten person then got one thousand dollars then I can stay in presidential suite already but cannot that's how they do it lah so in the domination of ten meaning let say kalau kau example kalau kau pergi zoo ke apa kan maybe zoo I don't know but now I'm not sure how much is the price maybe about twenty dollars then you just use ten dollars and then you know you you can use still pay ten dollars lah or maybe you pay you offset twenty dollars something like that ah tapi tak boleh combine lah that's how it goes but
I have the feeling they would be fully book and then hotels fully book you know tourist fully booked because a lot of people like to go so no need to kelam-kabut kata orang kan ah pelan-pelan ah next year pun boleh january pun boleh february pun boleh as long as pakai sebelum july lah so ya
kau belum pernah pergi sea aquarium ah eh talking about sea aquarium aku pun pernah pergi ah adventure cove
ah mampus
macam mana boleh tak orginal ada potong potong ke mampus kat mana ni kat batam ni indonesia lah
dia ambil they take a bit of commission a bit of a bit of help a bit right so at the end sampai orang punya tangan dah tinggal lima ratus jer ah kurang ah wah ini macam pun boleh eh mati
mampus take advantage of the whole situation lah to get something ah
takut daripada negative jadi positive
macam-macam ah eh sekarang ni
oh ya ya saiful one so touching ah I didn't know that he will do that video was like I was like what he really record down the video he say he miss his wife who is in then after that what he did he he go and purchase the binoculars two binoculars one for him one for his wife he send to his wife then after that pergi kat semberang tambak johor and and one of them dekat woodland one of them dekat johor dekat apa tu tempat tu eh eh
is this correct entah mana tempat tu

err saiful wedding then along the way I think because of this COVID semua tarik-tarik then in the end decided not to go when the announcement came that those who goes to singapore ah those from singaporean goes to overseas come back have to do quarantine have to do swab everything then become viral so in the end tak jadi pergi but alhamdulillah they get married in singapore first before the main one at malaysia what so kat malaysia semua cancel kan everything cancel because of this COVID ya ya ya true true true this year ya I think ya ya after that ah I think during that period still
people are still was-was fifty fifty whether to go or not to go to go or not to go then after that
and then the wife is there but lucky he get married in singapore then after that go sanding dekat johor kan ya ya ya true true true true
no but singapore pun ada

tak tahu because if not have to pay still have to pay what that means he if he bring his wife

ya dia jemput then just duduk berbual-bual then he was saying about err I think we're just asking like the school lah ya then I said oh I'm from zhong zheng then say oh zhong zheng I I wanted I wanted that actually she said ah ya but uh akak apa err macam pergi sana tapi tengok macam dah ramai orang then mak dia cakap takpe takpe apply different school so she said she applied for griffiths ya then ya I don't know suddenly it dawned on me just now like eh macam that I know if I'm not wrong kau pula as in kau apa your primary school was in griffiths so ya
eh is it still existent dah tak right
no cause last time kan I mean I handled K two right and then like I I see like parents some like really macam kanchiong macam want to push the children
oh no tak
asal dia masuk angsana pula eh
what is the tempat baru
orh eh mm green ridges tampines green banyak ah tampines green banyak sangat
as in dekat blok kau ah dulu
no like takut apa
termati ke apa dia macam wasted all the recording
um ya my budak nakal dia withdraw
ya but the reason was like they say it's not because of the school or anything lah is because like the grandpa macam is sick or something like oh having surgery and then um it's difficult for them to travel back and forth
so the kid I mean ah over for macam child care centre punya um like have to serve two months' notice so they still have to come to school for two months ah and they still have to pay the school fees for two months ya then they can
like if once like january like the new school year start maybe he will not want he will not really come to school because it's a bit weird to like start macam you know february
ya he's going to another school he dia kan very smart kan so dia berbual-bual lah tadi jer uh apa sebelum my shi</mandarin come for work dia dah bilang ni dah oh ah you're going to a new school um ya it's called little school house uh it's at tampines tampines station and like okay ya imagine three years old ya he's like crazy smart berbual jer like nonstop
ya but whatever it is ya I'm hoping maybe uh macam dah tengok macam gini kan maybe I could just stay for like
I told you right my my colleague apa mengandung I think dah tujuh bulan eh nampak perut besar gila then kena handle budak kecil tau
then dia cakap oh penat ah penat ah dia cakap kalau boleh dia cakap kalau apa dah apa ni pregnant macam ni jangan jangan jangan kerja ni ah dia cakap kan of course
I mean if you handle older kids okay ah but if you handle younger kids susah seh
kalau younger kids yes definitely pasal aku cakap kan macam bend asyik bongkok naik bongkok naik ya it's very sakit ah belakang
tak kalau macam um budak kecil like play group like kau kena cebokkan nak tukar diaper semua ya you're constantly using your back leh ah
ya kita orang macam gini okay lah habis kalau kau pregnant macam mana seh
actually what do head of departments do last like last time I was in primary school I always wondering apa punya orang buat seh like they like always always in the office like you see
consider own free time lepak minum teh minum teh kat lah canteen
orh eh then usually consider gaji besar eh besar gila kan
oh banyak five K
tanah besar kan is it
ah tak potong
a'ah sia dorang gaji tak potong
apa gaji tak potong wah shiok seh bawa balik
I I mean I'm not surprised that like ya earn five K because macam childcare punya principal also they earn like they can earn up to four K you know
climb cuma cuma aku jer yang tak nak panjat
nak stay jer
no because if I were to become principal I wouldn't have a life man ya serious I've never seen a principal who like can leave work on time if that principal can leave work on time it's considered cincai punya ya macam kesah tak kesah jer
but by right macam ya seriously like
ya I mean I mean kita orang dah belajar kan macam macam tak perlu I I mean that's the thing I know they say like it's not good to have this concept macam how to say ah
it's not like um the malas concept or something but it's just the
I mean every career pun mesti ada macam dia punya progression ah ya but

aku kat sana terkentut-kentut sia the last time I pergi dengan my cousins kan so macam stay sama bilik eh sorry eh sorry then dorang ketawa-ketawa boleh boleh boleh inshallah boleh ya

pasal to tell you the truth right aku macam aku have always been thinking like
senang untuk kita start the topic senang untuk kita follow with each other
maybe because of the connection ah mystery and connection pada kecil kita orang dah have been together this semua berbual
so kita nak click senang so for dia tak kan ada dead space oh
in your recording bagi aku that's very important kalau kau ada dead space jer mati jer
ya juga
then aku rasakan kalau kita nak buat podcast eh
one of kita punya daily topics kita nak kena ada apa ni

kau nak try message message dia tak like takde is it ada limit ke takde limit ke
takde limit shiok sia aku all the way sia aku buat ini
senang jer
aku it's just the problem that macam aku eh I know sometimes I hold myself from doing something
because aku tahu if I'm hook it might be a problem
for bicycle aku limit kan diri aku five hundred jer that time bila aku nak beli basikal but kau tengok berapa jual beli basikal
bro within that three months with that five hundred aku dapat dua road bike Cinelli and Giant aku jual beli jual beli last last aku beli specialised punya basikal
all and all aku spend about five hundred dollars
itu aku masih jaga-jaga diri aku tau bro aku kalau tak jaga let's say aku because I know for a fact yang basikal tu example eh
I really want to get a Santa Cruz I don't mind selling both bike and getting a Santa Cruz but aku talk crap nak top up sikit see when all this top up datang aku nak dah control diri aku and I know when I go fishing it will be the same shit I need I need small reel I aku need small uh set-up aku need big set-up nak pergi boat aku nak ada boat set-up
sama sama because you know I kita jenis orang K lah for example lah eh taruk ah drill stool
aku tahu yang aku boleh beli multipurpose punya kata yang screwdriver
yang ada plus minus all the top tu yang lagi dekat but we are the person who bukan macam gitu
kita need to get that specialised thing
faham ah like I I want the small one this is good for small one multipurpose for small dia tak bagus ah big dia pun okay okay and then aku nak lebih yang big punya separate small punya separate
you know because of this type of thing I'm trying to hold myself back unless kerja ya lah if like kau cakap dengan aku let's say kita punya kerja tak terganggu eh macam dulu eh timing baik gaji baik kan aku rasa dah mau join
but right now as of right now with the commitment dengan kita punya gaji affected
because from first session aku pergi dengan kau ya the first session yang kat bedok reservoir I still remember bro
picture perfect I still remember aku punya memory quite good
so aku tengok engkau pasang that hook jer I'm hook already kau faham ah like eh bestnya like it's it's
it's feel this hand work ah apa ini orang cakap
macam mana nak cakap eh
like handmade ah like kau tahu tak
kita suka use all that tools tools yang kecil kecil tu jadi aku tengok tu aku dah terikat macam sia lah aku nak belajar sia pasal barang ini kau tahu aku tak tahu cara pasang then I cannot I need to learn
then when I learn kau tahu lah I want to buy my own tools nanti nak beli Shimano punya toolbox tak pasal pasal nak beli Shimano punya sandal tak yang tak ada kena mengena tau bro dengan fishing
macam pakai itu sandal boleh dapat ikan lebih tu
that's why that that's why I know our be okay as easy as cycling you know sekarang aku punya focus jersey thor jersey semua kat rumah more than ten
sampai benda lima belas tu lah kemaruk sia ya lah that's me if I like something aku seldom ada hobby because I know that if I like something kan aku akan terikat kau tengok Tamiya very lucky engkau tak join aku Tamiya
kalau kau join aku Tamiya aku rasa sekarang kat rumah aku ada workshop Tamiya asal bro seriously
but Tamiya ada chance aku boleh ajar awal-awal aku

macam um kita used to go macam room kan tapi ni virtual tau tapi
it's find clues sama lah so instead of open up the box apa kan then you just virtually open the box the click and then dapat clue dia then you click newspaper ni dapat clue ni
you see ada
ah ye lah ye lah ye lah macam lah alah itu kan normal escape room macam you dah ambil clue then okay you go to different stages okay you dapat ni solve the first one
okay then you go to the next step then go to the next room ah then sampai the end okay then you solve the the problem
okay lah tadi cuma time lah you must go you must you must really ikut timing lah timing dia macam quite short abeh kita the clues sometimes you really have to like
really tengok apa dia sometimes kita ingat kan it's something cheem tau sekali alamak it's just that that first few letters of the the sentence then you can figure out okay actually what is it
tapi kita pun baca dia punya poem I thought the poem is something to do with the poem kita gi decipher the poem to know actually no need it's just there
tak macam dia nak kasi digit okay you click this okay in this room find the three guard three digit number for you to open up the door
it gives you seven like but then we were just reading the poem kita baca apa poem ni ada tree lah ada women passing by apa lah apa sekali takde terus after that I think we took some time abeh orang tu kasi clue lah actually you don't have to decipher the poem you just it's just there you just look at the poem

macam a few times dulu masa orientation punya program pun
mm but play along with such things kalau you you tak report report lah
ah tapi patut goes with other uni tapi dorang tak report
okay that one aku kena tanya achin dulu
kalau dia confirm ke tidak sebab dia tu last minute ada perangai sikit so she's always like last minute tak boleh or boleh so ya
he won't be coming because dia kerja
the best is we we need to ask them apa dia orang prefer eh is it they want to buy first or they nak order tapi kalau order pun leceh I don't think the rider can go up betul tak
then nak kena turun then kalau satu orang order lain-lain kedai
so wati jer lah belum confirm
okay so to lah ni
if the rest tak boleh make it kan I mean dayah can join lah bawa anak dia cause if if it's just the three of us
but but honestly ada orang tak suka
honestly aku cakap dengan kau ada orang tak suka
okay kau tahu kita tengah recording
okay why not kita just give
apa the leeway untuk bawa anak dia so that macam
since macam susah sangat untuk dia dapatkan orang untuk jaga kan and dia tak biasa orang lain jaga anak dia so why not
bawa jer anak dia but then engkau lah yang kena jadi macam discipline mistress
dia complain kat kau ke
okay I understand where you're coming from lah macam kau tak nak kawan-kawan kita nampak anak dia punya attitude macam gitu
kau yang last masuk aku masuk dulu so salah engkau
I mean it's a get together so might as well you you order a dessert selepas makan there's a pencuci mulut
ah then sambil tu berbual berbual gossip gossip kan

TAQWA is very err kira dah well known already
maybe orang-orang kau yang datang cina cina bangsa indian yang
melayu yang tak tahu pasal TAQWA because a lot of youngsters budak muda
macam around yang achin punya age and below kan ah dia orang semua go for TAQWA TAQWA is a more to macam islamic for the youngsters punya

jodoh lah jodoh dia very strong
kau secondary school bukan satu banyak so aku tak tahu mana satu jodoh kau which one ah which one ah
ali celup ya ya ya I recently remembered
oh is he still as good looking and hot like last time or now dah macam terpleot sikit
the body all still sapau lah
dia recognise kau tak
kawan dia girl ke boy sia
sekali dia cakap ya you look like totoro sia
ada any latest photo of him
oh thirty six baya safari lah
okay alamak leceh ah tadi dah sedap-sedap berbual itu lah dah nak dekat tiga minit kita berbual nak buang air liur jer
kenapa angelina tak nak ambil ini eh diploma in apa diploma in children punya studies apa
tapi it takes time apa masa of course like everyone I think like that lah I think macam eventually kalau macam dah get used to it nanti dah tak awkward apa
oh dah submit eh
habis izz nanti ni ah
ulang-alik ulang-alik ah ambil
kat mana eh poly mana
nanti kakak bulan tiga kakak dah start kakak punya course
kat bras basah and err tu yang course yang dia orang nak hantar ni advance certificate in earliest
ah dia orang nak hantar tak certificate tapi by right kakak punya actually I can
I can apply for another cert ah certificate in early childhood tapi kakak tak tahu kenapa the company sent me for this advanced certificate in early years which is err ni ah I think dia orang punya difference is
gaji wise
actually I prefer to take ace apa the other cert the pasal with that cert I actually can teach older children ah
pasal kalau kakak ambil one there's only a limit I can only take err handle kids two months to eighteen months jer
I cannot go for those older kids teach them eh curriculum tak boleh why kalau infant
kita nak ajar apa seh
tu ah tidur kasi makan
tapi tapi ah yang childcare aniq kan offer kakak dia cakap nanti after your course eh ah after you serve your one year punya bond with your company you come and look for me lah dia cakap tadi dia cakap dengan kakak
tapi I prefer here pasal dia orang punya
okay pasal every different different school they have their own different approach tau nak ajar so for this school is play based
my company they focus more on relationship base habis tadi kakak tanya principal principal cakap what is the relationship based curriculum
tak tahu it's just more communication ah with you and the kids ah so but I still prefer nya method because it's play based student learn develop through play
cakap habis dia macam ya whatever lepas tu dia macam why don't you come and work for me lah after your one year punya bond lah
I cakap inshallah lah lepas tu I cakap tapi the plus the downside is dia orang tak sponsor for studies the reason why I take up this company is because dia orang sponsor
go for it eh tapi macam
nak tahu juga dia punya pay wise is it
then tak payah kerja dulu lah since you like belum ada komitmen kan belum ada anak
just go for full time studies jer lah dah kumpul cukup duit tak if you dah kumpul cukup duit then you just go for full time studies better for you because cepat habis instead of that one year maybe six months
of course lah definitely lah that time kakak kan cakap dengan izurin lah kan yang masa korang kahwin kan I told izz if you want to apply for house I can actually recommend the agent okay the agent cakap dengan kakak for now izz tak boleh beli rumah yang
dia punya income now is actually not enough to buy a four room dia actually nak apply rumah four room daerah rumah kakak yang lama tu dekat kan
then err dia cakap then where can he apply lah but actually izz can only get rumah yang dekat boon lay taman jurong dia macam rumah lama old flat lah really old flat
ah tapi macam tempat dia pun not
cakap macam the area not really that
cakap tak apa lah then ah izz cakap tak apa lah tunggu lah tunggu then dah kahwin mana tahu dapat boleh apply

tu lagi busy spent a lot of money you know ah lah mak
masa zaman kakak kan my time was like
then ah that's why lah I cakap dengan mak actually I was the one who wanted we discussed kakak dengan abang nasir discussed that we wanted combined ah senang
then mak cakap tak nak tak nak cakap mak okay apa ni you save money what you know that time I have to spend like twelve K thirteen K package just on the catering part you know the the mak andam is different money you know different set aside different money

waste of money ah pasal abang nasir wedding he only spend ten K only you know dia punya wedding dia punya catering
then dislike macam habis inai pun tak cantik dia buat because he said inside package so when the person came down then you just imagine just to do drawing but they don't know there's no henna caps so I was like kita macam ah ah kan macam eh kenapa tak pakai inai eh

macam ah okay
dia nak jaga budak tapi tak nak jaga tak nak tukar pampers macam berak ni semua tak dia tak buat
dia belum kahwin tau budak tu younger than me ah very young I think about your like your age
dia macam suka main handphone pasal kakak perasan ah bila macam kakak pergi outdoor activity ada dengan class dia dengan kawan dia on the handphone tak jaga budak-budak budak main-main dia on the handphone
kena complaint lah kan sikit hari kan kita ada this centre planning day right ah last week so the the principal brought up all the feedback from the parents ah so dia indicate ada one of the parents ah teachers always on the phone terus kakak cakap wow okay sekali bila kakak jalan kakak pasal kakak keluar dengan lagi dua orang kan two more teachers so like the my friend was like pointing ah at my colleague dia cakap
handphone dia tunjuk tangan begini handphone lah this one lah this one handphone lah habis macam oh okay yang kena complaint dia orang lah dua ni
senyap hmm
sama sama jer like no difference jer like normal lah
ah tapi
tak lah okay jer
tak all the pregnancy macam okay jer tak ada apa-apa jer macam I don't have any anxiety bila nak beranak
macam okay lah beranak beranak okay lah lah beranak ah I don't know why some people eh macam very nervous ah nervous padahal macam tak ada apa-apa jer macam kan macam is it just me or what like err ya tak ada masalah apa-apa just like lay in a bit lepas tu cakap oh time nak sakit sakit lah but the first
I use epidural ah because they said it's very painful very painful I cakap oh I I I don't have eh for mesti tak boleh handle punya lah so cakap ah so when the doctor asks
nak pakai epidural tak then I just say go yes epidural that's why bila macam I mm mm I got one friend off of four pregnancies she never used epidural tapi dia cakap sakit memang sakit lah tapi bila bila masuk beranakkan anaqi
I didn't get to use the epidural apa
then lepas tu I macam it's not really that painful what a'ah ah pasal
err on that day itself yang err abang nasir nasib baik abang nasir tak kerja
so lepas kakak ada macam this craving nak makan sambal pizza sambal pizza ikan bilis tau macam Domino's nya that time so I ate that then macam sakit perut cakap ah nak berak dah tau padahal dah dah due date itself so tak terfikir nak patah balik hospital
so ah then kakak nak tidur lah cakap sakit perut macam nak berak tapi tak berak ah tidur ah tidur sekali macam bangun pukul tujuh lebih eh tujuh setengah like that cakap eh kenapa macam lain macam tau sakit perut macam nak meneran-meneran so I pergi toilet tak keluar pun eh then sakit perut dia macam semacam macam datang tiba-tiba sakit dia contraction cakap eh ni ah maybe this is the time lah
pergi dengan lepas tu cakap dengan abang nasir I think we need to go to hospital send send the kids dekat dalam kereta kakak tak boleh tahan tau macam tak boleh jalan cakap eh sakit perut semacam lah
lepas tu cakap dengan abang nasir ah err tak boleh tahan ah so along the way pergi dari sini rumah mak pergi
abang nasir kita kakak dah diam tau pasal abang nasir try to talk to me then I just like don't want to reply cakap ah err ya lah um macam please don't talk to me because I don't have the mood to talk I cakap itu ah so on the way I tengok kat tingkap eh bila nak sampai seh bila nak sampai this is like this is this baby is torturing me sampai dekat hospital tak boleh jalan so kakak cakap dengan abang nasir I think you have to get the wheelchair for me I cannot walk
so duduk dekat wheelchair ah sorong naik dekat labour ward
nurse macam tanya uh how is what is your pain score
I cannot say already ah err dia macam ingat kakak bedek-bedek tau cakap just a little bit ah cakap lepas tu dia macam hegeh-hegeh ambil my data err dia cakap can you walk no I cannot walk I really cannot walk I cannot stand okay nevermind lah I help you sekali dah pergi naik atas nak check dia cakap eh baby head come out already tapi kakak rasa macam nak berak ah ah sakit macam nak berak tapi kakak tak ada macam mm nak berak nak bersalin macam tu kind crying no no crying you know
so doctor err nurse masa tu doctor belum sampai pun
so nurse cakap you wait ah you don't push ah because baby dah keluar kan habis you cannot tahan apa so I just I cannot tahan already I rasa I want to push now ah cakap no no no no don't wait for the doctor first dia tahan kakak begini seh cakap no no no no sekali I don't care whoa terus menjerit baby keluar ah baby come out already ah lantak lah buat bodoh tapi actually tak sakit pada kakak
so then bila dah beranakkan aniq pun tak sakit eh sakit sakit juga I think aniq was like the less pain the least painful lah of one aniq I was like struggling a bit because tapi tak nangis lah it's just that tak boleh keluar macam I I think kakak masuk malam pagi pukul satu ke dua
then err sampai esok petang baru kakak beranak
kalau dah doctor nak ni apa pergi caesarean then I told her I don't want I think I want to walk because I feel like it's like I've been on the top of the bed tak gerak so the thing cannot go out apa
so I cakap ah I cakap dengan doctor ah can I just walk
no no you cannot walk you have to stay on the bed if not anything happen then we not responsible dia tak kasi jalan
tapi pasal I think about the same ah sama jer ah then my friend cakap pakai laughing gas ya use laughing gas tengok I don't laugh what
my friend cakap dia pakai tau kakak pakai macam biasa okay jer tak ada apa-apa boring dia cakap dia cakap ada ketawa dia high
ah then abang nasir pakat lah cakap you use this one ah tahan your err masa yang beranakkan aniq ni lah macam sama jer tak ada beza habis nurse cakap lah kat me dia cakap you must use properly you must inhale right then I said what I inhale I inhale what
abang nasir sampai dah tertidur hmm habis tak keluar-keluar dah keluar belum sakit belum habis check check the machine right kakak rasa macam contraction point contraction point hmm okay lah macam rasa tak tak okay jer cakap but the contraction got got some ni tau movement ah eh tak rasa pun doctor sampai keluar masuk sharifah how is your pain
cakap you sure or not you six already eh ya four
wah really ah good ah you cakap okay lah then sekali bila macam eh how come your dia pasal dia cepatkan dia punya ni tau err dia orang pakai oxytocin lah nak cepatkan dia punya err labour it's still the same
dah dah dah dah pecahkan water bag
letak oxytocin sama juga so doctor cakap if you are bad err I give you two more hours if by by this time ah if you never err have any pain err caesarean terus macam huh I don't want caesarean don't want don't want okay I will try I'll try my best
a'ah lepas tu cakap eh budak ni tak nak keluar kot tidur dekat dalam dah dah best dekat dalam
abang nasir cakap ni kalau tak ni kena pergi push bawa naik ward ni nak kena caesarean lepas tu kakak cakap tak nak ah habis dah macam buat kelakar habis abang nasir cakap buka lah buka habis dia tidur dekat sebelah kakak macam eh nak berbual eh tak ada orang tak berbual
beranak habis if your if your pain threshold is high
maybe tak sakit lah pada kakak pain threshold kakak memang high I got high tolerance for pain so that's why macam bila beranak macam tak ada apa-apa tak cuma I think that time masa first punya pregnancy kan orang mesti cakap sakit sakit actually macam tak apa
it's not really that painful then orang cakap sakit tak beranak actually okay lah pada kakak macam macam sakit sembelit nak berak it's just like berak-berak macam constipation that's all hmm
bising ah anaqi he's crying ah
that's why dia cengeng ha kuatkan suara dia
but you cannot just take anyhow jamu you know because err some sekarang jamu tak tak ada macam banyak mixture
err drugs lain so it's already not in a pure form
dulu masa yang kakak bersalin dulu yang urut pun cakap err jamu-jamu sekarang banyak yang campur tak authentic so that's why it's dangerous ah
because it can affect your internal organs apa a
mak lah selalu suruh makan kena paksa makan lah then have to eat habis jamu pakai jamu pill pill okay ah mak punya time lagi teruk jamu macam kena masak punya tau
but what options like kan that time kita tengok a few then after that is like
still macam okay lah boleh lah
I think dalam err a hundred plus ya below two hundred should be okay like I think kita total ada empat orang jer
should be lah anyway pun is
it's dekat mana
tanjong pagar boleh buat apa sia tanjong pagar ada apa
lain kan I always get them mixed up I always get them mixed up I'm just saying yes
yang ah oh that one is yang tiong bahru market kan
ya but I think more or less is confirm lah cause karim punya date pun macam
okay lah it's just satu hari jer apa right monday
anyway can there be a macam
why not cause like every time kita selalu buat like this kind of theme apa
yes ya because that one was dekat yang halia so
tanjong pagar theme apa
orang pakai good morning towels lah
kan I thought that time yang kita pergi makan then I was asking karim to decide on the matter
I don't know I don't know dia dah decide ke belum but I think that time dia ada cakap R
kat sembawang ada too bad kat sembawang ada
eh we did giant ke eh
by the way kipas tu mana
kan panas kat tempat dia
but dinner kita belum choose a place
kat kopitiam jer
nak kena lohei eh
okay kita cari father christmas
like macam
macam carousel
that's very menyemak kalau aku jadi server tu aku bingit
sibuk aku nak buat kerja sibuk kau nak order
he wanted to go there but dia kena cancel or something you know no like the location kena change or something
jonas very vegan makan
I thought we can book but tak boleh mingle
tapi yang last one makan seorang
okay lah macam homecoming ah gitu
I mean tak payah jonas pun susah kan nak makan
nanti edward complain lagi cakap should have change lah should have change lah
so means that is settled then it's just the hotel jer but date is settled lah and I think makan pun is
kat sini pun dekat kan
hotel punya room jer lah
I thought they are going to prioritise yang the elderly or like
don't know kalau dekat sana like
then like it's err pasal plants
like plant nursery with dia punya mak
then um the funny thing was dia seorang jer yang pakai mask
mak dia tak pakai mask
mak dia tak pakai mask so it's like huh
and ya lah dia orang punya rumah kan selalu mansion mansion berapa storey semua kan so they can afford the space but it's already like
one of it was like a cactus not the tall tall cactus ya dekat desert punya bukan
no no is not succulent it's like probably macam the height
no it's like macam the height of the snake plant ah
it's not a fake one it's not a fake one it's not bukan macam kau punya this thing
it's quite bendy but then bila dia dah tua like it's quite stiff kind
yang dia beli tu is quite an old one so it's quite tall
pokok mango
ada banyak problem than benefit
especially like a globalized world right now macam kalau you lockdown means there are a lot of things gonna stop
so macam there's a lot of disruptions
bukan natural way lah like like the business way the business way is that macam kena halt and and
ya this's why I think that it create a lot of problems because macam like
you think about it all the businesses dia orang punya momentum is already there like going and stuff like that then when this lockdown issue come then kena halt suddenly and you are forced to rethink your own ways of err during business ah so it's too soon to adapt
cause macam like if you see about
I mean I don't know about your area lah but myself like ang mo kio this kind of area my banyak orang-orang tua live right then like you see those apek-apek duduk bawah block baca surat khabar that kind just like just duduk bawah block that kind
and you know you're not allowed to go out and you are you're forced to stay at home then is macam
I don't know but I feel lah macam dia orang punya
normal way of living pun kena change forcefully change so in that sense you especially bila dia orang dah like this kind of age
one thing is that dia orang pun could probably be living alone and this is their only form of macam keeping sane and err you know socialise that kind of thing like
businesses wise I think um I think between businesses and societal macam thirty seventy
thirty to business ya cause I think kalau macam
kalau you are just suay lah then you just buka business baru then kena lockdown then macam okay lah too bad for you lah but businesses wise like you said it can be a
err just a method oh oh a matter of adaptation and how quick you are lah but then also macam those traditional businesses pun macam losing out also because
they are traditional lah like kat kedai kopi ni semua
okay lah I mean on the other hand pun macam you need to also see like macam for example cik limah punya kedai mee rebus tu
but I think about limitation leh macam like for example the reason why maybe cik limah tak pergi digital is is maybe because dia punya um expertise is not there then kalau she go digital pun macam siapa nak tolong dia kat kedai to go digital and the reason why maybe she doesn't want to even be on grabfood is probably because she only have maybe one helper help dekat the shop then if if her shop is really booming the business which is good for her but then ya ya lah but then like on her side pun macam it's difficult for her to handle the volume and then kalau let's say she is able to handle the volume then like what about the you know the same card with the riders and stuff like
enforcing or like really okay lah enforcing macam a bit tough lah but like um pushing people to like this kind of places to go digital
underprivileged families where you are staying macam like all those rental flats that kind that is a point to also kind of bring up because
there was also this macam article I think dekat dekat mana eh
the straits times or something like that yang this um
the and all these case lah basically macam dia orang punya wifi bukannya strong kan like you know you have a lot to handle
aku tengok kat luar tingkap jer
foreign worker punya dorm kan ya
maybe I don't know like dia orang should probably lockdown in stages agaknya um
I think definitely the biggest loser is like the orang-orang tua who are staying in their who are staying on their own that is really the biggest loser because
I mean orang tua like they probably don't have
it's probably just a land line dekat rumah yang ya ya ya and you can just call to hear your other family members voice but you can't see that
cause I think dekat news pun ada cakap pasal the number of domestic abusers
to be honest like I wanted the to kind of go on cause ya it's quite lepak
problem okay what do we talk about pasal societal business err
no ya bukannya tracks semua ada pokok
but aedes is because of air bertakung right
unless lah got one pokok pisang dekat in the middle of the north south line from yew tee to kranji
ke wild boar dekat dekat sembawang
dia orang enforce the rule people will really follow apa it's like you have all those mm mm
kau bunuh ah
apa benda kau bunuh lion tu
were these animals obtain kan and so kalau macam they're like exported from overseas then definitely the home country where is being released
merepek ah
remember there was this report pasal mink farm dekat mana entah
that animals roasted already lah pantang liao
no it's the it's the monstera with holes but the leaves are smaller and it's not dia punya
wait lah nanti dia dah besar dah lah letak balik kat dalam
so technically dia orang punya care is quite princess lah they need the right humidity so it's not that much of an easy easy I mean it's still an easy plant to grow but it's probably not that easy as a fern
cause like it's not like monstera where you can see that that the leaves gulung like that then they will
this thing doesn't gulung what
dia jadi go
dia jadi brown
I didn't know then no I never no lah tak jadi
ya like it cannot get cold seem like merepek ah dia just setakat satu malam jer
apa is standard pokok
ya bodoh
ya so it's a very sturdy plant dia punya leaf macam like those kind of pokok pisang punya leaves but it's err
of course right cause you are not pokok pisang
and I still want to collect more plants hopefully dia tak mati
they never like pakai those kind of watering can no like
you know the food container the dabao there from container dia just scoop air gitu then dia
pail of water and pour the plant mah dia pakai watering can jer
ya I mean they will say lah like macam kalau the top all the dry then you can water that kind lah bukannya hari-hari dia water the plant
okay dah boleh start
belum is it nice
I saw like it's like metallic right macam kotak like that the design
tak lawa sia
betul lah
yeah aku nak tunggu price turun aja and then I can buy
aku dah lama tak pergi ah so macam tak ingat and I don't remember everything there
whoa so so berapa bilik
wah tinggi juga ya I thought usually I thought usually the bigger rooms will be lower
mm tapi like I think if you get city view you get sunset view
not really aku everyday aku sekarang kerja aja bangun bangun and then I just like relax for a bit and then I go go kerja
pasal ape ah
oh ini yang ada Jihyo right
itu banyak juga ah I mean it's it's normal amount of episode but if it's boring then just drop it man
eh you know the what you do for kau kau stay sana for like three days two nights kan
you let's say you booking pukul dua right
then korang buat ape
ah oh jalan jalan eh
dengan baggage semua
that one time I main layang-layang kat kat Sengkang right biasanya Sengkang ada open space before they made construction for hospital or something then like it was so windy that day I nearly hit a kid cause the kid was so close I was my mom was like okay kau eh kak you you you make the kite fly leh cause cause apparently I can fly kite quite well lah I don't know why that time maybe because very windy then the kid I turn one round the kid was so close to hitting the kite and I was like oh oh oh I like panic sia cause the mak pun sebelah dia je then I was like alamak kalau kena mati aku
me now me aku
orh berape mahal eh
yeah so total hour setengah
oh so so thirty minutes swimming thirty minutes mandi
then you kena keluar
is it then they still allow tak de lightning warning eh
is it is it now sekarang the the design is it like moon festival or what
yeah lah I mean like I had the membership a year membership because it was like twenty dollar something right I I keep going there until like I just go there for aircon only at that point because the aircon was quite cooling right dia punya aircon kan like sejuk gila nya then I was like okay let's go in relax tengok bunga okay then then I go home
wah during during pandemic was the worst lah that I have to be stuck at home boleh gila sih kat rumah dengan enam orang oof
apa you say what you say
like we wanted to go right we wanted to like plan a hotel staycay dengan kawan sekolah but then the pandemic happened and then every place just kena abandon sia
yeah man it's not even overseas people just staycay in Singapore pun susah tapi tak pe lah I think no one had money and somemore everyone like no job also
cause like she already misheard she thought thirty three hours a month then I was like that's a bit too little of hours to work to get an incentive then she recently come back to me and tell me bilang err Nisha you need to work thirty three hours per week baru boleh earn ten dollar I'm like yeah that makes more sense lah
thirty three hours per week that one is like if you work lapan hours a day for empat hari right a week you can roughly get thirty three hours like eight like as long s one day you get nine hours lah you can get thirty three hours
yeah and somemore she haven't she's not a barista yet I think at that one point Coffee Bean nak hire temperature screener right cause like they they really lacking manpower for it then they hire temporary screener first then after that they learn to become barista lah
yeah dia sekarang she she's just a temperature screener jaga burung dekat outside jer
mm yeah then after that after that she can can make drinks then I can kacau her after that
but you kau nak start sekolah soon right
yea like November ya October ah tak ingat
but then the results dah keluar eh like your whether you can get into the school
then sometimes kau pun macam malas lah nak cari lagi
yeah normal lah I mean you also not very like apa orang cakap like err what is the word ah oh main main blank like tak cerewet like that lah
are you cerewet no right you just you apply for most jobs already but like criteria doesn't mean your expectation also right
there's so many videos about it now then I I mean I played before lah aku pernah main dengan kawan poly I was like I want play seh like like I just want to play
you need you need you need minimum lima orang eh
mm can ask our secondary school punya kawan
it's very fun you know like there's this there's this girl I I must say my volley friend lah there's this she at first I thought she wasn't the intruder then dia datang she always follow me you know dia always next to me sebelah aku aje then she like suddenly swipe the knife around me and I'm like then in this game right the rule for us was that kita kena</malay>ok we were in a voice call and when we play we have to like mute our mics lah
then once someone kan dia have to like discover the body
yeah then dia report body aku then dia bilang wah I found Nisha's body here here here then I'm like then if you dead you cannot talk in our game then I'm like oh my god this this this girl this then I just keep maki on the other side because they can't hear me right then I just keep maki her like wah this this girl ah she's lying so well ah and everyone was like so who's the killer who's the killer I'm like ugh it's her it's her she's she lied so well you know then I'm like ugh I hate I hate her I hate playing with her
then got there's also another one where I'm the intruder with this other person the girl that lying very well I was the intruder with her then after after err intruder can like like kacau dia punya system right like you can like disrupt their system then they had the members have to fix the two things lah so the system will go back up then so when everyone has to go to this location to fix it because you have to like press your hand dekat machine itu lah
yeah lah cause this one you can like ada van then you can like apa ada mission juga you can see everyone instead I would mafia game kan macam kau kena tunggu the time only
then it's quite it can get quite  macam bosan lah
same like when we when it was the birthday party for mine recently kalau kita semua main UNO semua right it was it was quite fun lah honestly
I'm hungry man I like oh you're craving for meat ah but you're not a meat person right kau tak boleh makan
kenyal-kenyal ox man
I I won't be surprised right if you dah kawin then kau beranak kan then you like beef suddenly
are kau serius ke
funny lah usually pregnancy kan macam unknown unknown cravings
I thought I thought you said kalau the ikan is pregnant and people don't like and I'm like that doesn't make sense
oh my god I want I want I recently was talking to Yin Shen about picnic then suddenly nak dia nak main layang kan because since that last year want play layang already
then I was like oh can we go picnic then then he said like okay kau nak join tak we go picnic but
what but what apa
like currently dia nye holiday bulan eh it's this month it's this month like on the twenty eighth of September if we pergi Isnin
okay I think next week then we next week next next week next next week next next week then we can bincang
dia orang dia orang selalu dia orang uni course sama eh
no I'm saying like their course from poly to uni sama
they dia orang selalu nak jumpa buat ape
no lah I mean you can meet lah but if you wanna meet every week macam penat kan nak meet like you already tired from uni then they still wanna meet
I mean they were they were nice enough to tunggu tunggu kau punya reply lah
is it I mean I guess I mean secondary school of course more easier to handle this food thing compared to poly punya kawan lah like I also got bad experiences with like kawan poly semua nak makan yang tak halal punya benda then I'm like okay you guys go ahead then they are like why you never follow then it's like no brainer what you guys nak makan yang tak halal then then kau invite aku buat apa kan
I hate it I aku tak aku tak suka eh paling benci aku when I hear that kind of phrase then I'm like yeah you you can't eat here then we buy side for you or something else no wah I I had a debate with that with Chris for the longest time you know like can't say that it's just not nice you know if you want eat eat together if not don't eat it at all that kind of thing
I'm like wah paling benci sia aku dengar apa that that phrase
I mean I don't I mean I I okay with them but when it comes to certain hangouts right nak nak jumpa dua orang like that I like I don't wanna really meet them anymore
yeah it's like you waste your time and effort keluar rumah pakai lawa lawa then kena pakai bus nye card lagi bus transportation for adult fare is so much
eh kak aku tanya eh kalau naik bus kan straight okay let's say I want go to A to B then aku naik bus aja is it cheaper than changing from bus to or what
yeah cause like kalau aku naik bus satu jam eh if I take also around forty five fifty minutes kan it's around the same time tapi like which one will be cheaper
yeah but I feel like if if I was the person cause her her topic was what technology dengan benda lain kan I don't know ah Singapore technology thing then I'm like okay I think I would cater more towards the disability
tapi nak tunggu bus tengah crowded is a bit I don't want to pay extra money for this
hmm but the thing is you don't know if they're really disabled like usually the more the the ones that you can see is the one dengan anjing kan
um especially nak naik nak naik ape transportation kan public transport
nak senang kan diorang nya apa diri
yeah we're so used to having five senses susah nak compare dengan orang lain pun nak susah juga lah like we always kasihankan but we never do anything right
forest fire not fighting fire api
so apparently recently or is it this week or last week ah there is a forest fire kat California or Oregon and it was caused by a gender reveal explosion
it is so stupid diorang tak pakai otak eh it's like during summer somemore you know then they do this kind of stupid things
it's still happening now it's I think it's for few days then diorang kan kita nampak langit kan biru lawa their langit is red eh
yeah but imagine leh like it's so stupid you'd rather waste environment things over your damn child's gender what then sekarang pun macam you know I I like okay whatever people born to be lah that kind of thing they wanna be bi whatever I'm okay with it then like what what if the gender is not what their gender is supposed to be there's a lot of like debate on it
wah what if then they knew when they dia were they planning your name to be different
yeah confirm for that nine months right diorang macam ingat nak nak namakan untuk lelaki right then suddenly perempuan keluar then they on the spot have to think of a girl name leh
over the top maksudnya apa
know yesterday aku kerja kan sorry I keep changing topic then yesterday aku kerja thought it will be crowded lah cause Thursday gonna be Friday so I thought will be crowded can you guess how much I earned for I I work at F&B lah can you guess how much I earned for the whole shift
tak sampai tiga puluh aja
none I get seven dollar per hour right then I only make sales tiga puluh dollar aja or less than that twenty seven I think
yeah I thought okay lah at at first I thought airport will be crowded then when the last customer left around seven forty five I had to quickly like sweep and mop right cause sometimes overcrowded kan tak ada time nak sweep mop then you leave then you leave work late right
then I quickly sweep and mop until eighty fifty cause no one then I just wait and wait and wait until pukul sembilan eh then I'm like should I wash the air fryer now or should I wait cause sometime last minute also got Grab then aku tunggu aje lah tunggu kan in the meantime I just make like takeaway waffle
dah tunggu sampai sembilan setengah tak da orang eh I was like okay I just close up everything ah
kan like err don't know you should be happy or not like I'll be I mean for boss profit is addicting right this one is like I feel like I'm earning more than how much I how much I get profit from the ShopBack leh tiga puluh dollar eh it's like twenty seven eh I was like oh my god this is this this is easy money
I I guess so if you like if for the previous two days if kau macam busy gila macam selalu ada ramai orang then suddenly one day you just just quiet your body kind of just like zone out
eh then nyari Kelly kerja eh
but usually Friday ramai orang ah like it can hit incentive very very easily then I like I cannot I don't want do Friday cause I I hate I hate it that is only one person then I've to clean up everything
I save the earl grey cake sedap eh

tapi kalau open concept itu
jangan jangan letak apa itu kena ada letak partition juga seperti gelas lah
jadi bila kalau you nak masak
ah tak ada minyak itu tak berasap ke seluruh rumah
ya betul
err orang yang orang yang apa itu membersihkan
mm dan dan apa itu
menggunakan uh vacuum special
I think beliau bercakap
dia cakap memang kotor ah macam minyak itunya bila dah bersih

nanti I boleh order menerusi ruangan yang ruangan lubang itu lah
nanti kalau I nak letak loceng
jadi bila I nak panggil you sayang
I picit loceng yang itu
no lah you not my waiter tapi
so you hari itu you cakap you nak you nak
uh harga quotation itu berapa so kalau within budget I think we can
I don't know whether want to do a partial hack ke or
or total hack ke
so itu kita kena tanya
kita punya lah what will be the quotation
you cakap you nak nak nak hack certain areas
dekat the platform
whether it's whether kalau within kita punya budget ah
ya uh ya platform itu pun dah
so kena tanya lah kalau kita nak hack and then nak pasang a new
baru punya platform
ah berapa akan quote kita
platform memang platform memang mahal
ah so kena
kalau kalau tengok lah tengok budget kalau macam terover
maybe just hack and just letak vinyl
letak vinyl
tambah tambah platform
oh dekat uh
uh dia ambil dari mana
bagus juga lah you ada survey survey tengok-tengok jadi you ada idea lah
ah nak nak nak
nak buat uh renovation lah nanti
it anyway tingkap itu pun kita tak akan buka
kita akan tutup what sebab you selalu takut ada binatang selalu masuk ke apa
I think yang yang yang sliding door okay yang yang yang sliding
sebab kita pun bukannya nak nak nak buka kan kita akan tutup jer
ah dia dah dah haus benda pun dah lama kan
uh so ada juga ah ada ada banyak juga design
nanti I I I ambil gambar dan kita tengok bila kat daerah sini ada ada cantik juga
dia punya apa itu dia punya tingkap macam ah style condo condo style
very nice cantik
you can consider tapi tengok lah harga dia berapa
is what kita kita mungkin dah dah bela dari kecil
sampai dia membesar membesar lama jadi dia dah dah dah dah sebati ah dengan rumah kita macam
dia tak dia pandai tau dia kalau kalau kita ada dia dia tak keluar tapi kalau kita macam tengah tidur atau apa dia senyap-senyap sebab
kadang-kadang nampak macam tahi cicak err
dengan err apa itu
dengan spray spray pencuci lantai semua
uh memang kadang-kadang tu kadang-kadang lepas kerja tu memang kadang memang memang nak memang nak bersihkan
err letih balik kerja satu hari itu kerja kita penat jadi
time kita kalau kita tangguh tangguh tangguh sampai
berhari-hari sampai berminggu-minggu sampai kadang-kadang is err isteri ya lah macam biasa lah isteri kalau
uh itu dia akan
ah ya lah faham-faham lah kalau
kalau kita tak tak tak buat itu faham-faham lah nanti apa isteri akan buat kan
memang uh ya lah I understand lah your your your fear your your concerns so that's that's why we are having this you know
the kitchen the kitchen apa itu
who halfway uh merajuk and don't want to come
ya lah dia dia ini
you know like malas-malas to to come
so emotional then merajuk
ya macam I bilang you lah uh err kita kasi dia orang arrange
kita kasi arrange yang yang rendah sikit lah sebab kita
mungkin will markup
or work kita punya budget so kita kasi them
arrange yang yang rendah sikit lah
actually ya lah macam lampu ini semua kita dah
uh kita dia punya cost itu kita boleh kurang kurangkan lagi ah
uh banyak banyak kirakan banyak juga lah kita dah tukar yang sikit-sikit ini dah banyak juga
so I mean sekarang ini yang the more yang lebih
tengok lah macam mana berapa dia orang akan quote
macam uh the the other time I I I
I tanya quotation ya lah macam toilet itu toilet itu kalau dua toilet
kurang-kurang pun at least satu toilet pun at least maybe three four K
dua toilet is around lapan K just toilet
itu sekali terus habuk kirakan termasuk kitchen dapur bahagian sana lah sekaligus ah
tak yang yang bilik tak yang master bedroom vinyl kita almost thousand
thousand four thousand ah seribu lima seribu
apa yang bilik bilik master kita nak buka
agaknya lah
kalau nak ya lah kalau nak buat memang
memang I murah sikit lah tapi I think leceh ah
tak apa lah bayar lebih sikit biar the biar yang yang yang the experts
ya tapi bilik ini dia punya flooring
yes dia sejuk panas sejuk panas ha tengok ini dah merekah lah
that yang yang
dia merekah nanti jadi macam ah master bedroom ah sebelum sebelum itu kan macam masuk air semua kan nanti itu dah sebab sebelah
sebelah toilet itu yang masuk air semua itu yang sampai terpecah
sampai menggelembung eh
ini ini bukan ya ini bukan yang
I don't think this the ini vinyl yang
so so so tengok lah
kalau master bedroom we do it around berapa eh thousand
so kalau mungkin dua bilik ini mungkin
oh mungkin dalam dua ribu ke agaknya estimate nya
ya they can they can they can offer probably a better rate lah tapi that time kita pun kita punya budget pun tak banyak kan so kita buat yang yang urgent dulu lah
sejuk ah
kalau ada ada baby baru ke so at least
you know by now it it definitely better than the floor cause in terms of safety dia tak keras sangat
kalau jatuh pun at least dia ada macam uh cushion this vinyl kan underneath dia ada cushion kan
then tak sejuk sangat
kitchen punya flooring
yang yang I I saw one of the picture you send
with the kitchen punya
but uh ya the one that we saw kak doro using I think wah
tak ingat seh I think like since COVID about
asal kau ketawa ah kau teringat something ah ni kan mesti
a'ah that time yang aku video call kau tu lah yang kau ingat tak what happen that time
tu ah
kerja aku rabak juga ah like because I don't know whether
um kerja aku recently buang orang like at least two K of the staff are gone so right now I mean the ones that are left semua nak kena buat you know pick up the slack abeh lagi banyak kerja kena buat
everything can be done via the laptop lah but the only reason why we need to go back is because we need to apa tu collect dia punya physical mails
eh aku tak boleh imagine sia like I will I cannot even you know
both of us ada short attention span and like to have
abeh like you can't even like focus and
banyak orang juga like you know stress eat
I see I will check that out I think one day aku check it out
oh that's fun speaking of joget recently also like literal you know literally yesterday err me and my sister we just on like random youtube videos just follow through macam dance punya youtube videos which is quite fun you know at least when you're dancing kan kau you don't feel I mean you're burning fats but you're having fun so you don't dread you know like as opposed to kau buat like um
HIIT workouts I mean that works better lah because you know it's a specific punya macam err they target specific areas of your body to workout right but then when you're dancing you're moving your whole body and then you are having fun also so and then um she she we decided to because we have four I mean she we decided to apa tu download
this thing err this game apa just dance eh ya so we've had we've yet to try that err it's going to be fun I mean honestly as much as we hate to workout
like you feel more refreshed abeh nanti kau tak feel so lethargic when you're working you know like people say they always have no time err always very busy but if they make time at least like ten minutes in the morning or before you go to bed that works as well like little bit goes a long way
I'm not one to preach but it is important lah cause now also zaman sekarang kita makan semua sembarang all fast food and things like that you know as compared to zaman dulu kan they're more much more
it doesn't matter how long ten minutes pun jadi ah
highly ambitious niat tu ada but selalu tak kesampaian like I set my alarm on at six in the morning everyday macam berangan ah like macam kau nak oh berangan nak jogging at around the neighbourhood for at least an hour or like at least half an hour ah
and then lepas tu start the start my day right you know working and then like macam feel refreshed okay that happened just like once or twice
ya like you said ah tadi you just have to be consistent ah
kena monitor ah
ya like macam if you eat healthy you clean you eat clean it will show like your skin your complexion
will show that you're glowing you macam tak nampak so tired or worn out tau
aku memang suka like dark err like because I don't know like
entah eh macam tak lawa sangat ah
ya I hang it like macam fairy lights around dia punya ni ah my my bedroom punya frame
and then I took it down I actually still have it lah and then macam because I prefer to use like macam candles more sexy and cosy and then like you know with the smell and stuff like that kalau fairy lights when you switch it on kan
I think the orangey type I guess there is different settings ah different modes that you can choose from like macam those like blinking ones or like macam alah you know macam lampu lap lip lah basically
ya I use it is dia macam aurora lights
no lah I mean I don't switch it on when I'm asleep lah bila aku nak you know feeling spa day nak relax then I on the spa music and then light on my candles
bila aku nyanyi ya bila aku nyanyi nak feeling feeling
a'ah eh berapa lama eh kita dah kawan
kat gek poh ah
two yes tapi K one
K one yang dekat err mmhmm uh huh
sama eh
tak ingat seh but I know it's

the last time kau cakap dengan aku dia
something about his throat eh sakit ke apa
rajin seh kau
you know macam you gave so much um care and concern love to others
obviously you don't expect the same in return lah kau ikhlas memang but
correct me if I'm wrong if you're feeling like macam it's one sided like you
you know then bila kau sakit tangan ni semua I mean it's not it's not even something minor I mean is a big thing you know like
it is a a problem for you it's an issue for you so macam he's not putting in that effort maybe is that is that what you are saying like macam all this even though you guys have not been together for like a long time
err it is all about compromising and macam if you're the only one putting in the effort and and and being invested
then entah eh do you really think it's worth it then
a lot of things like macam
aww dia blue tick kau oh dia seen kau oh my god
what if you didn't do that you know because okay to be honest out of all your exes dia yang paling decent
if you may never know mana tahu
but if it's not then just end it right then and there and you know at least you know for a fact that okay I've tried you know um but this is really an end to us like you know we don't fit it in in we don't fit in each other's life anymore so kau just
move on at least you don't lay in bed at night you don't don't lie to me I know like you you you you play all these things scenarios in your head kan bila kau like you know
late at night kau tak boleh tidur thinking about all these what if you know could have should have
just don't be hopeful and don't expect anything much just ask him out casually ah you don't like macam don't don't make it obligatory for him
kau tanya jer
and then kau action ah treat him for his birthday or what
bila birthday dia
oh dekat tu
tak ah kau action macam oh my god isn't it your birthday today or isn't it your birthday this weekend
ya or um no you know what if you ask that then it'll be like what if he says no so you have to be like err jual mahal but at the same time like hey you know okay I will suggest you to say just ask him like
err do you have any plans macam a bit needy you know what I mean like if you will say like macam err let let let's hang out you know it's like more casual as opposed to err do you have any plans macam like secretly hoping him would to say yes
kau set reminder set reminder
dia sama age dengan kita eh oh
an hour we should like start a podcast or something lah it's like a good outlet you know like to to to voice out whatever you feeling and to catch up also lah dah lama kita tak jumpa kan and and it's like so good to to finally you know
you know kat belakang and not at the front so
love life aku boleh like you can literally write a book out of it man
my nonsense my lain my love life lain
same same thing same thing about my work tempat kerja err like my workplace
it's like err the shift timing and all is like change dah tukar semua so we like have to adapt lah ah then
around seven to four and then that's for the morning shift then the afternoon shift will start about four err four fifteen to one fifteen lah and now we change to four macam around
then apart from that also I think design macam like for social media ah poster ya uh macam gitu ah
so uh so cerita apa
you like what what you watch dekat netflix
ah I see uh I see ever since uh apa after COVID then I think like netflix release quite a lot of err nice nice err movie or series and
an italian cafe ah you know dekat bali lane eh ah bali lane ya
err macam sedap ah ya ya
better to macam reserve lah
watch a catch a movie ke apa ya really
like normal lah temperature taking and all then err you you have to be seated err macam just staggered sitting
you kind of have a extra privacy ah sort of ah that kind ya tu ah
I think kan macam
kalau orang itu err okay lah let's let's say macam nak buat plans kan
um macam my my friends wants to make a plan or plan out something and then lepas itu
we already like so into it already then then after that like suddenly last minute they want to cancel lah ini itu lah then ya that that kinds of err annoys me ah
ah suka advance planning tak suka macam last minute ah
ah macam my off days also you need to consider ah
tu ah then how about you
oh okay ya I I mean like it's true lah like macam you're not being yourself err not being true to yourself lah can say
certain things ah macam minor I don't know
like you know do do you still keep in contact with your like macam primary school friends ke secondary school friends like
who who is among your friends yang lama kenal ya still keep in touch
apa eh like they are not
then semua ada like ya like married and stuff ya so macam
my secondary school friend I still I still in contact and one of them is also like I'm I'm in a I'm in a band so ya so macam
macam like even now tengah tengah susah kan like some I think some of my friend also dah hilang kerja ah kena buang ah kena buang
so dia orang macam susah lah
kesian ah ya
so I heard kan you suka you like indo music right
so macam huh indo I can see from your face lah you look you look like the kind lah
macam gitu ah
ya yes yes especially tengah hujan ke apa so wah best mm
very err macam mana nak cakap
mm tapi tak lah macam teruk sangat macam
err heavy metal ke apa ke macam gitu no lah ya but
I also like macam kalau time macam hujan ke
macam time malam-malam I also like to listen to macam post rock you know like instrumental lah gitu ya
like very very dia macam macam
just playing err guitar for example guitar or piano ah macam gitu lah
then dia macam ah ah macam lena ah terlena ya
oh start up business takde lah takde lah apa apa business pun macam okay lah err
it's just a macam err small service lah can say macam kita kita buat err this err apa eh
macam you know is in indo I think it's stands for
like like ah let's say people macam request for something
in indonesia they they want it in singapore so we can request from there ah macam service gitu ah
like macam anything ah from snacks ke err makanan ke or err baju-baju
ah sebab I think kan pasal pandemic pasal COVID then kita dah tak boleh pergi indonesia ke nak pergi negeri mana-mana
I like suddenly macam struck an idea like to go and
err apa
like we can we can use this service or people can use this service untuk err apa
um bring bring food or bring apa-apa lah like snacks ke apa to singapore lah like they can macam some
macam ada orang dia orang rindu makanan-makanan indo then dia orang macam uh teringin ah nak makan
actually it's just three months aje lah ya we are still in our macam trial trial run lah kita tengah tengok macam mana err dia punya demand and people's punya response semua macam mana
and dia orang kalau happy
willing to venture out more lah macam venture in
ya like I think this is now macam a good opportunity untuk kita buat
such a business sebab
sebab kita kan
dah tak boleh travel
business I think mainly macam communication ah dengan ah like liaise
language barrier ada sikit ah pasal dia orang kan berbual bahasa so ada certain things kita tak faham then kadang miscommunication juga macam kita nak cakap satu benda dia orang interpret as something else
then uh tu tu one of the difficulties lah
then lepas tu macam err
sebab kita kan tak boleh ada there
then lepas tu
macam err we we
ah ah ya ya ya sekarang susah eh
ah we go sekarang mm that's why
like some now nowadays you nak beli groceries you pun macam susah I mean like you kena err cut down cost lah
kan selalu kalau tak boleh pergi ke apa just to buy our necessities then sekarang dah susah ah sebab barang-barang kat supermarket semua mahal seh then
hopefully lah inshallah ada mm
err first thing eh actually mm mungkin I want to go morocco
a'ah morocco one of the place then lepas tu satu lagi dekat new zealand
new zealand ya uh those two are depends not really dah lama but I think is err one of the beautiful places kan
but I I've I never I've never been to like err macam mana eh like those kind of err moroccan kind of err you know country ya yang macam ada those kind of architecture ya
so it's quite interesting lah untuk tengok semua ya
I suka macam tengok permandangan mm macam gunung-gunung
err macam gitu lah
ya sebab err
it's very beautiful lah kan like ya I I I've actually new zealand I've been to I dah pergi norway
ya uh uh uh so macam is is such a beautiful place lah
ya so then like like I think new zealand is also one of the one of it also so macam
that's why nak experience it lah
mmhmm macam very ya macam very chill and then lepas tu santai-santai ah
actually kalau macam new zealand kalau kita sewa macam caravan kan
I I think boleh consider lah parents macam err elderly ke orang-orang
yang susah macam kurang upaya ah macam gitu ah dia orang macam err okay ah they can just macam duduk dalam caravan tu
lepas tu relax
relax sahaja
so macam
I don't I think it's a it will be a good experience untuk orang-orang macam dia orang ah kan macam actually my parents pun dah berumur juga
my parents pun bukannya pergi
jauh-jauh sangat dia orang selalu pun paling jauh pun err indonesia
ah ah so indonesia punya view
indonesia punya view dia macam lain kan dengan new zealand new zealand macam ah then also dia punya climate pun
err lain ada sejuk sikit ya mm mm mm
mm correct macam I rasa
kita kan orang melayu kan so kita punya apa lidah or something eh our taste buds lah macam mesti kena ada pedas ah macam gitu or mesti ada
sambal ke apa ke err kalau macam bland ke macam let's say pergi western punya country macam makan pasta ke makan macam cream cream or cheese mm tak semua orang macam melayu suka kan macam ah sambal tumis lah ah apa
ya lah different perception macam orang pergi dengan parents mana pergi dengan
kawan pun macam mana kan ya so
ya if if for me maybe it's sebab sebab err
sebab apa kita macam err sometimes kalau okay lah like when we were young
you you don't have to fork out any cash ya you don't have to fork out money parents your parents will like buy for you or spend like so you don't have to worry about that lah but with friends ah you have to consider all of these things lah budgeting lah apa all that
like when that time I went to err europe ah then I experience the snow and all so it was err quite fun like you can have snowball fights semua ya then like you do all the silly silly things lah ya that we you don't get to experience in singapore kan
ya so but err how to say macam the aesthetic
uh I think jackets at least we can still save lah for our next few trips ke apa ya ya hopefully get to experience again
err oh ya okay dah pernah pergi lah ya I went before uh once ya
so I think you also went to korea right if I'm not wrong korea like huh korea and japan I think there are a lot of similarities but but the difference is I think in the terms of macam
orang dia you know macam like the the people there are really polite
polite gila like they
mm you should try the apa
err I'm not really but depends lah on the circumstances macam if you ask me to go skydiving err part of me would want but part of me will be scared lah of course ya cause like I'm that that afraid
ya I think I I don't I cannot I cannot even bunuh that spider because
ya so eventually I think we just let it be we just macam like throw things at it and slowly the spider went out of the house
tak lah tak ada lah ya ya ya ya this one I think can say quite
not not so hairy lah the normal tipis but but it looks it's like the size of my palm lah around there
cockroach dah mati bare hands tak boleh lah cockroach is quite dirty
macam kan
dia punya kulit tu macam keras then like I don't know I cannot tak boleh imagine macam mana orang makan
orh maybe when lepas dia orang dah kukus then dia jadi
lembut sikit lah is it
honestly I feel like good looks is macam
genetic ah like kalau your parents
you macam
I rasa macam
good looks bukan benda yang you boleh work for but fit body is
dia tak boleh dapat any other way
I pun nak tanya
cause err I went I went to some I went to gardens by the bay kalau tak salah
because macam
I baru baru-baru ni I main apa tu
I I main kan then I noticed ah
you know then it's like especially now because everything is so macam
senang nak pergi nak nak fly back dari like singapore to like and all that stuff very interconnected so
I rasa macam
kalau kita orang err
kalau manusia were to be extinct right
then I rasa
most likely way would be dari viruses macam COVID lah that kind cause we are so
you never ever really hear about them pasal
tak ada banyak orang yang pergi africa
if we tapi kalau
going to africa to like visit ke apa
you might find like a lot more of these diseases more common in other places tapi like if you also see right
africa pun dia orang punya COVID cases not very high
so kita orang tak
tak prepared lah kira
I faham I faham
tu tu okay tu kalau
kalau population turun kan
the world gets better in a sense pasal
the the one problem that we're facing now is terlalu banyak orang tapi tak cukup err tak cukup resources macam you you said economics right that's the first thing that we learn too many wants not enough
so in a way unless like if yes our kita orang punya population turun
pasal like stuff like hunger and all that stuff
it will go down but it won't go extinct pasal there will come a point where
dah cukup like now we finally have enough
kalau you boleh err
kalau you boleh dapat tiga skill
yang err apa-apa skill lah you nak
apa skill yang mungkin you pilih
apa-apa lah
so kira like you you can you play soccer so kira maybe like you can dribble very well you can pass very well that kind
or if you want to like make it specific soccer to simplify also boleh lah
you punya
apa third one tadi
okay lah I feel like that yang yang the last one is
you you tak boleh manage stress you are done
in in my in my opinion lah like macam
because I run like competitively so I rasa macam ada orang yang
yang yang yang very
nak nak pergi dia orang suka competition macam gini and all that stuff
untuk I kan suka competition but at the same time I cannot help but feel nervous before competition like I like there are people who love the competition and they just it it comes naturally to them like performing well at competition they like that competitive part lah
if I have one skill it will to be to just enjoy enjoy that competition take that stress yes but understand that you dah kerja dah dah dah dah train dah work very hard for it
I feel like you can translate the endurance into almost anything and everything that you do because what comes with the endurance is not only macam
bukan physical jer tapi
also dari segi mental
boleh tolong ah pasal
I rasa kan
so kalau kira I tengah buat
err example lah during err exam during exam period kira kita orang stressed dari like buat maths mathematics ke apa
kita orang boleh pergi main bola ke boleh pergi lari and all that stuff ni benda yang I rasa orang lain tak faham ah
macam dia orang kira oh
main sports like during that exam period is like wasting time and all that but dia orang tak faham yang like for people like us people yang selalu buat sports and all that
cause macam you do math then you are like wah
wah tak boleh ah tak boleh I cannot solve this question then you very stress
then you will like wah then you even more stress you you feel even more like lebih teruk
jadi like
I macam
I can okay there are times when I can read situation betul betul tapi
and like most sometimes it can be bad lah like with around my friends is okay you know because they know how I am and all that tapi kalau let's say in a setting with like older people or all that stuff
you know so kira you you I'm not the kind that will mince my words when I see something wrong
so I rasa like that's one thing that I can work on lah and that's something that I should work on
apakah sesuatu yang you
you nak
apa yang you nak yang you wish that would be free
that will be free of like free I mean not just free of charge dari segi wang tapi juga macam you don't have to work for it
like it just comes macam gitu
okay lah then we keep it to benda physical lah like macam yang benda monetary ah monetary
free untuk
because in my opinion macam
and macam you will feel very purposeless
like macam sekarang
kawan-kawan kita orang semua macam bosan tak tahu yang tak kerja lah tak kerja tak like training macam kita orang
dia orang macam bosan tak tahu apa nak buat then like I have had
ada lah orang yang bilang saya macam dia orang feel very purposeless tak tahu apa nak buat pasal sekarang dah habis exam kan abeh dia orang
tak payah belajar and all that stuff
okay lah you can make money from it also but in a larger extent you can also help to eliminate problems macam world hunger and all that stuff you know
it will help not only myself but it would help orang lain
satu hari macam in the future that will be that will be not a superpower but that would be something that well have like like you get what I mean like in the future you will probably be there will probably be like a machine or like just something small that you just press and you can just go to wherever you want
ya just because he's dia dia masih dia masih manusia macam kita orang
dia the the relentlessness the drive that he has
is what makes him macam different
macam he will not stop until
that he that dia dia
dia deems as
um not good lah so basically whatever he does is really untuk kebaikan orang lain that kind and he will like do anything for his family
the the the common pasal I baca comics kan the common like theme throughout semua yang semua
dia very rarely dia make mistakes
because dia selalu fikirkan betul-betul
buat ah kerja dia betul-betul make sure make sure that like he gets it right
but there are times when dia pun
apa tu dia pun makes mistake lah because he's human what so
oh carrying on with that because you know how batman selalu macam
kadang-kadang in like comic kalau you baca
so going off on those labels that like you you can think of for batman right what are some labels that you rasa
can be good can be bad you you just say lah apa-apa lah
a label tapi macam
it is an idea yang macam
kira okay so
that that label that oh he's a he's a very good runner therefore he can do he can run like apa-apa jer you know
I don't know lah I I do like you I macam plays a lot of
because you got all these outside influence kira then you
you know you get what I mean kira
I mean you said that sometimes it can be bad that's true it can especially when you are kira unfit for your standard and all that then people mentioned like eh how come you today like a bit slow eh how come like you look like you put on a bit of weight
kira it can be good lah
given your current life kan like kerja cause kita orang baru habis err exam
tapi like if let's say like five six years from now
lepas lepas lepas uni bila dah start kerja ah
to be fair I also macam I I feel the same way as you
your dream job you want to be physiotherapist and you say kalau
people you nak kasih dia orang apa yang you tak you tak ada
I I pun nak macam gitu tapi I rasa macam the one job that I would enjoy the most would probably be training
so like being a coach cause sekarang like I I already sort of do that lah kadang-kadang like macam
I go back to school then like I help some of my I tolong coach I
to like err ajar budak-budak yang baru masuk macam gitu lah
then I rasa macam
it will probably be pagi
they especially kalau lari kan so like morning will probably be an easy run
tengah hari probably another coaching session but in between probably lunch break or something can slot in like a gym session then after that like the coaching session this coaching session probably like just coach a bit
and then not much running probably macam benda technical and all that stuff which I can also do lah in that sense which would be better because in a sense kalau you are doing the drill or you are you are training with the rest of the team or like with your with your trainees
that would be and then that is like probably in afternoon then at night probably another training session in and stuff like that lah this is of course like you said assuming yang tak ada orang lain dalam apa tu dalam err my life lah that kind
I don't know I rasa macam I punya ideal life is very training centric
by the way foodpanda helmet masih ada tak
ingatkan nak pergi ambil besok ramai orang masa tu uh queue untuk ambil helmet
takpe lah by the way ada kerja kosong tak
okay nanti bila hari isnin ke apa bilang ayah lah
macam abang azri pun boleh if not depends ah uh similar to my intern kot
oh by the way then our family this month ada apa-apa plan tak
oh dia orang pun join juga ah
alesya punya birthday oh
oh habis ayah tak pergi
takpe lah kalau tak pakai untuk hotel boleh book apa lagi
okay lah kalau gitu you enjoy your staycation with ibu nanti boleh makan kat cafe kat masjid sultan sana
oh how many season mampus okay no thanks
air fryer buat apa nak air fryer kita takde ke
okay lah tu murah kot ada warranty kan air fryer lagi
oh tengok oh tengok ah macam mana kalau masih ada sale tapi ibu tak nak beli apa-apa
oh habis tadi siang tak cerita dengan ibu
series main macam filem
kenapa suami nicole yang jadi suspect
serious kecohnya bodoh apa
habis kalau gitu netflix ada tak
lol leceh habis besok keluar dalam tak
tak habis-habis sia habis kalau gitu tadi balik tak nampak pun motor scrambler mana motor scrambler tu
dia hantar sevice apa
habis kenapa tak suruh full service jer
uh untuk motor tu
ha gitu jer lah dia tapi tu motor untuk abang ayie eh
ah biar lah asal dia orang dua bahagia lah
a'ah uh engineering informatics yes betul
dia punya is more on
uh engineer punya side more on not say maintenance dia punya more on testings
I not too sure because so far not much people joined using background ya but maybe I can try under rovers the one uh ya yang test setakat masuk setakat duduk from point A to point B back and forth back and forth for I don't know eight hours but not bad lah the pay that's I heard
I mean I don't know but I'm looking forward maybe work like abang azhar on hands on stuff on the component and stuff ya or maybe I dunno maybe in charge of there because I have a friend who works at as well ah he he works at dia kerja kat jurong uh water catchment area so his job is to keep track of the water level uh when it rises when it lowers err which areas going into rain whether certain areas flooded or not that kind of thing basically it's like
I wouldn't say call centre is more like a to overview uh every uh mostly entire of singapore like know the longkang and stuff like that
okay lah not bad I mean he is considered full time but they call him a intern cause dia masih dia orang sponsor dia orang sponsor dia sambung belajar
a'ah dia tengah ambil part time diploma
ya dia tengah ambil kat uh singapore poly because near to his workplace ya bayar sampai bayar sampai habis uh second year ke atau I forget I never got
but tengok lah macam mana
I wouldn't mind but I'm not too sure what else because usually people just know uh you know they ride by they saman people and then some of them is under roadworks they supervise construction site and stuff and some they handle ah like one my friend she intan at uh hers is under
dia bantai jer gaji dia besar
I mean kalau pun not bad uh dia sampai what two let's say you habis two forty five you extend what pukul lima pukul enam then after that
ya I think so oh ya ya yang tadi kita berbual-bual
ya ke ingat oh
five to seven lima ke lima tujuh ribu depends
huh murahnya
tak semestinya bising apa ada lagi benda yang uh
huh sebab dia bising mungkin kadang-kadang clutch housing kadang-kadang bearing kat dalam engine kadang-kadang piston banyak benda yang akan effect your bike
ya lah me lah I mean ha kalau boleh sebanyak-banyaknya ya tapi the reason I want to use is ayie's not say lumba your bike considered
untuk budak-budak err bawa motor nakal tapi you bawak terus jadi motor apek
okay lah kalau gitu how about kita share
apa X one apa uh oh oh class two A ke class two B oh two hundred oh
tapi tuan dia sendiri tak duduk bawa buat apa menyemak kat carpark
okay lah cuma at the same time nak kata nak kata sayang tapi
tak boring ke tak boleh bawa lebih dari enam puluh
kesedapan at the same time untuk keselamatan enam puluh bawa motor boleh jam boleh rosak takde ke fikir macam gitu
got a bit lepak ah in a way so he thought want to earn more money
no he he he was dead serious dia betul-betul uh dig through everything asking me macam
uh all three companies had deliveroo foodpanda grab apa dia punya benefit apa dia punya you know uh
apa uh akan jadi kalau gini gini semua so I ceritakan dia lah I was uh apa tu
I bilang dia macam
okay kalau foodpanda leceh dia kita kena book shift kalau deliveroo dengan grab uh anytime kita boleh start boleh offline
uh antara ni tiga company tak semestinya uh masing-masing ada uh dia punya
benefit dia tapi at the same time ya lah he tak boleh cerewet lah kita kena banyak sabar because
I pernah tunggu one hour for just one makanan so one hour you guys is like you working part time so it's not really worth it man actually I can earn
dia macam dia macam okay jer macam
boleh jer tapi at the same time tak tahu lah pasal motor tu kan pun under ayah
pasal dia malas habis dah tahu sekarang barang-barang dah mahal nak cari duit pula so okay lah pros and cons ah siang-siang boleh buat tak nak tapi understand lah maybe back then his workload was too much in a way lah pasal dia kata uh
ada budak baru masuk this and that so macam workload dia macam kurang tapi macam spread uh evenly ah so untuk dia
uh advantage ah pasal dia dah tak buat malam punya shift lagi dia ada pagi atau petang so that time dia pernah tanya lah macam
uh dia ada bilang dia punya uh cadangan dia kalau dia buat
kalau dia kena pagi punya shift lepas habis pagi dia dia uh ha dia buat delivery dia dia kayuh daripada
uh lepas maghrib ah sampai malam
tapi tak tahu dia akan buat ke tak lah dah cakap dah uh dia cakap senang ah pakai bag kau abang tak payah beli so you know lah your brother macam mana eh
huh ya lah dia dia berbual kat orang jer ah cakap jangan bilang gitu-gitu tapi tak tahu dia buat ke tak lah
ya tapi tak tahu lah I mean dia sendiri that time nak pinjam orang duit nak beli motor orang pun terkejut entah kalau tidak dia nak beli padahal dulu dia ada yang kat yang kat bawah dia tak suka dia cakap banyak problem this and that so I don't get his point ah
pasal tak tahu lah dah bertahun-tahun tahun ni juga dia sedar oh ni motor ayah tak boleh pakai suka-suka you know tiba-tiba rasa nak kasih balik tak paham ah dah banyak dah bawa berapa tahun baru tahun ni juga dia sedar tu bukan motor dia
dia tak kirakan dia nak kasih balik motor bagi kat ayah so dia beli motor sendiri after dah berapa tahun ya dah bilang dah dia punya tu tapi tak tahu lah dia
uh huh dia tak tahu bukan nak kata berbual tin kosong berbual tak betul
tak pasti ah tu kena tanya ayah mmhmm mungkin kot
then oh then that time apa abang ada tanya
uh he he dia tanya akak kerja grabfood macam mana mmhmm then I said lah macam gitu lah dia I uh I say lah the difference between us is that she only work during the peak hour I work almost full shift
you do delivery I think you fight with the customer or the vendor only then then dia terus bingit ah dia cakap apa maksud kau cakap memang lah kau panas baran macam gini macam mana
tunggu sikit lambat kau dah maki-maki how
tak orang tak takut dia kena buang orang takut dia kena viral jer
ya ada yang that time punggol budak-budak grab gaduh dengan vendor pasal tak tahu sabar I think it was some promotion lah then I think
ya jangan jadi viral I mean that we do even though people might might not remember
oh oh ya my friend my friend kerja roo uh this entire week then she managed to earn quite a lot lah even though
I mean kita dah layan hujan habis
bayar sikit jer you know so for roo to do that I'm very amazed lah
oh tak distance dia memang dia dia add on tapi ni dia tambah lagi because dia orang perasan somehow I think orang complain pasal hujan then you know safety and stuff so at least
worth it and you know macam berbaloi ah
ya for roo macam kadang-kadang boleh dapat lima belas so if compared to grab I have to take three orders tapi three orders pun tak semestinya I can get within less than one hour
ya waktu
macam tak masuk akal no she didn't she wasn't aware until I tell her ya because she works err when she wants she was so she's not really depending on grab but she just if you just work for the fun of but ya when I tell her this so for her to do actually heard about this to her she find it like she pity for the other riders who get affected by this ah because it's considered their rice work ah
bukan bukan apa zina cakap pasal terrorists ini semua
and this is why dia shouldn't come in yet
okay kejap so dia orang actually sudah kenal berapa lama
dua tahun they know of each other for two years okay
oh habis yang budak ini dia duduk dekat yang the couch yang facing apa
ah dia duduk dia duduk dekat the mirror side lah yang facing the living room there right
so dia memang uh friend of a friend is it
tak tak penting ah
ya and then dia cakap
so dia dia kalau police dia kalau finish a certain number of years bond dia dapat yang bonus itu kan
he's and and so he's actually macam upfront and really just
apa yang susah sangat yang izat tak habis-habis yang macam cakap ah habis kau nak tanya dia punya gaji semua kau nak interrogate kan tak payah tanya budak ini sendiri cakap
eh merepek eh
so what happen you tanya first ah
apasal kena dekat istighfar eh
ya lah tapi pasir ris pun ada yang akan datang apa
nak cepatkan kahwin dia ah
he still thinks it it was the right thing to do itu ah
ya allah okay so oh tak tapi ini yang ini yang revise punya plan kan
yang mak dia cakap nak dua tahun kan tapi kalau tapi dia cakap ah the original plan
duh itu yang kita cakap kan
oh my god susah benda ini sudah jadi so complicated in the last three weeks
habis you tak tanya mm pasal kenapa nak kahwin sekarang tak tak tak tanya tu
zina pun nak kena grow up ah dua dua dua
habis budak itu tak cakap apa-apa at this mmhmm
grow grow up masing-masing
huh maksud apa
oh okay maksud dia macam dia cakap macam dia cakap lepas kahwin pun boleh grow up macam how zina puts it ah lepas kahwin pun can still do this
but I I don't know how much dia orang faham of this growing up thing I think macam fikir macam oh it's just about career future entah lah
mama duduk mana kat sini
mama dekat kitchen apasal mama dekat kitchen huh
oh habis
did you say macam jangan sembunyi-sembunyi did you say that
ah habis dia okay jer
macam dia the leader lah you can quite see that there will be the the nature
so memang dia dua puluh lima ah
entah lah
habis you tak tanya pasal dia punya family
oh I know the the dekat there okay ya I was there last time
habis zina macam mana dia punya reaction malu-malu ah tersipu-sipu ah
habis dia tengok macam alim-alim type tak
ini lepas si ashraf itu sudah balik ah habis
habis this is when
mm habis
habis then you say
supporting lah ya dayah yang kena support lah
ah habis apasal taxi driver
tapi dayah but oh my lord macam like
dayah is at the stage of her life that she's driven and macam have a lot of aspiration
habis dengan orang ini walaupun dia educated ke atau dia kaya ke at the end he's just going to be having this err aura of like macam relax jack and that's not gonna fit well the dynamics
tahu tahu belakang hari dia yang suruh nanti hidayah eh uh tak payah lah berbual pasal ini okay lepas itu
macam it's so like you can totally see right away this might go right he'll be the kind of husband lagi worse kalau dia have this patriarchal kind of stance that he'll ask that he ya worse if you the add up like this particular profile to him like character ke apa if he has it okay that macam he might ask dayah to stop working and things like that lah
habis so you just say that ah
it's about the character the driveness the dynamic of this guy ya dia nak kena match that's the thing okay that's the thing I don't understand pasal
this whole like family who yang macam oh tahu benda orang orang I don't know family ke sesiapa ah yang rasa
oh lebih baik err halalkan percepatkan
macam as if macam itu ikut sunah nabi okay they take that part of the sunah nabi of marriage but the other part of the sunah nabi of marriage the that that the prophet also say that you should marry somebody that is of your standing not to say that it's like macam your social status your social economic status kind of standing but it's somebody yang macam that macam is complementary to like your personality
mana boleh macam like that ah ya you cannot take somebody who is super relax jack err macam complacent you know that kind of personality plus the a very driven kind of person it will totally clash
ya ya but that don't you see macam that is the thing that orang just always pick and choose what they want suiting what they want of the religion to suit what they just pick and choose what they want of the religion to suit what they need it to suit you get what I'm saying part part nak kahwin cepat macam oh ah ikut sunah nabi percepatkan but part part lain macam
to get somebody that is competent with you ini semua tak tak ambil kira ah
uh anyway this boy the call you abang or what
he should be comfortable with it lah dia ada kakak apa
oh so that's when he call you abang ah
so the conversation dengan zina err bila yang ashraf itu sudah keluar it's more of like what what did you say to zina pasal yang the growing up and then pasal pasal making a apa plan habis pasal apa lagi like what else did you address
I think you know what you can from now on you can use this card against her every time she like this like this ah kata nak kahwin nak kahwin nak kena wake up music just just just use this card
kata nak kahwin kan orang nak kahwin macam gini ke nak cara itu tengok sampai perempuan agaknya she will just be fed up one day tapi betul apa macam
we feel you're not ready about marriage because what do you expect macam do you expect it to be something that you will be led by this man who is has her leadership character who's spur and can lead you to be a better muslim blah blah blah
easy go easy uh macam mana nak cakap uh ah apa
itu tak ada pendirian lah maksudnya
no macam gini the thing yang dia nak kena differentiate is ada bezanya easy-going dan tak ada haluan this is the thing zina you are which one
easy-going atau actually you are directionless
you said that ah untuk si ashraf ini ah habis ashraf cakap apa
ah budak ini pun tahu ke tak the background of zina
so this easily two years baru meet up tahu
I mean yes macam I am thankful and it's nice to know budak ini budak baik err so like what izat say kau tengok jer lah budak baik kau tengok gerak alih dia
ya lah ya tapi I don't want after this izat say huh kau tengok macam aku cakap
dia budak baik I hope izat doesn't go like this lah ya but anyway
entah lah don't know whether he has the mental capacity to differentiate that
sambil lewa anyway what I was saying okay
I really don't know lah this the the dynamics of the relationship how healthy this is but then again I really don't know if this is what it takes macam to
push zina tapi I don't know if at the end of this product is zina will be
you get what I'm saying it can really work both ways ya that's the thing I don't want macam at the end of the day not not at the end of the day but at the end of it all zina loses dia punya identity because this she is she is macam dissolving into a very
ah it's so it's so possible you know it's so possible lagi lagi dengan zina macam dia see that I don't know lah sometimes they'll see some examples around the that as if macam she and she that makes her think that this is the
ideal way that macam you know like ah a woman shall be like macam be led by a man that kind of thing and
at because at some point there will be a point that macam she will realize that her identity is being consumed if she doesn't
no it's not say tak lepas tangan it's just it's just that
for the fact that she hasn't explored her own identity now and with this incoming overshadowing person it makes it worse faham
macam because by right this is the age where she should be exploring her identity and she finds herself tau this twentieth uh twenty some age
but dayah said yang dia berbual dengan zina yang pasal dekat yang denmark itu
women like when we say personal stuff we really mean deep personal stuff orang punya personal is to us superficial
then you tak cakap macam dengan zina
at the end of the day zina dayah is still your sister macam you know she still cares for you lah then you know like
maybe she you tak cakap lah why why didn't you say to zina tadi like maybe she doesn't know how to show her care properly but she is concerned for you tak cakap dengan gitu tak cakap macam gitu
then bila you cakap pasal yang zina denga dayah ini mama and abah was there habis
apasal you cannot chat ini
my why is my recoding still err okay you continue kejap kejap ya my recording is kind of
dia ah habis nevermind lepas itu then she say what dia tak cakap apa-apa
no but you know why she walk off I think it's not that she she don't she doesn't see your point in this because I think to her like ya she's been close to izat ever since macam she's been involved with the basic babysitting of the
and just because izat is convenient to the topic that you want to pursue lah cuba kalau the topic that you want to pursue is actually about further studies kau rasa kau akan berbual dengan izat kau rasa izat will be supportive pasal apa
like it's still at the end of the day is very skewed to what is your agenda and what is your topic isn't it don't say that macam don't say that
you are macam ah tapi ah it's not that she will see all this point
habis if I were to ever raise it up of course it will never go down very well in this
habis cakap you're close to izat pergi lah suruh izat tolong ah
budak ni segan silu wow
but that's because dia orang don't even see that they need work on it so that's why they are not even thinking of approaching you to tolong them and like mend this thing you know that because they they are not the point to need or to to work on it lah
but it's hard lah I mean it's also vary in age age difference macam I think if you have if you have not inculcated cultivated the relationship from young also
oh you also cannot engineer it what salim like macam you cannot be bringing the two of them together
habis expect dia orang macam uh to boleh berbual like at a very deep level mana boleh like it will also feel it's so janggal macam it was so it was just feel so weird lah
yay okay um oh my god can you imagine I cakap yay pula nanti dia kena transcribe lagi takpe takpe okay
oh how come ah how come boleh
but still two and a half months pass by quite cepat actually kan
oh cause macam
bila you start the project dah start is it the project that they were doing at the place
oh eh the area dekat dekat mana though
what was I going to ask oh but then macam was it susah to like
you know you you took on like new cases atau existing cases that they pass on to you gitu macam tak hard to adjust
macam short staff short staff sikit lah gitu
oh I think I remember your office dekat mana dia tempat uh my office dulu kan daerah situ
uh apa apa itu nak cakap mm
oh tapi padahal they
ya so macam your experience is good lah from the oh
and then macam environment besides environment wise macam your your bosses and your supervisors and your teammates all macam okay lah like okay like no issues
pasal dia dah biasa with what macam
tidak apa lah kita apa itu take turns
are there ada interns lain or you just seorang intern like or like got other people macam doing their practicum there also
I see okay okay wait the interns usually macam fresh grads or
all macam budak masters or like budak degree macam you know same level as you
oh so it's not macam it's not necessarily a happy time for them kind of thing
ketawa but then hundred cases for the whole for the whole year atau
ya ya ya ya I mean I feel like that's a common how to say a recurring issue in a lot of macam
macam organisations lah
you know ada this issue
apa itu offer so called
it's okay keep your options open then macam explore um you know macam lain opportunities when do they need to hear by
uh okay tapi tidak ada tidak ada macam deadline for the application
ya faham faham totally faham
cause tadi bila I ketawa kan dia punya line macam besar
apa nak cakap mm
oh okay ya I totally understand macam the need to take a break I mean
studying kan lagi berapa lama before you finish the when you finish your masters
tak necessary is it
mm ah ya ya understand I feel like I'm there also I'm thinking macam you know I really don't mind
so macam who knows maybe if I if a a different place macam even a different job a different industry I could enjoy it enjoy learning something new even if you know it's not something that is related to our degree lah gitu
okay is macam zoom is surprisingly so much harder than tak zoom you know like it's so hard like you have to take note of everything like macam you have to make sure everyone is paying attention you cannot
talk you cannot macam how to say cause zoom if two people talk at the same time then you cannot hear one of them so I must be careful not to interrupt the teacher who's leading the particular lesson cause like um when I
and then macam the way you talk to them actually on zoom kan you don't command as much like authority or respect I feel so macam the tone macam they taught us we cannot be like can you please you we must be like I need you to stop
ya I mean right now they hardly recognize me also because I'm not their regular teacher and then macam I get a bit sub ah subconscious a bit conscious bila I punya camera on so macam when my camera itu on so I boleh nampak my own videos I'm like hate this makes me very macam self-conscious gitu lah
so tapi bila I off um I am less self-conscious I can be less
err I can be more strict gitu tapi I tend to not because kita have to senyum for the entire lesson senyum for the entire forty five minutes to an hour so macam
kalau macam camera off then I will terlupa to senyum gitu lah ya so a lot of things to take note macam
tapi dia orang macam type nonsense tau macam hi hi hi hi macam
kalau answer dia A they be like A A A A then I'm like
kind of thing you know so it's like ugh but then okay lah they are cute and I'm getting the hang of it I think tapi ah last week I did not teach because um oh so on thursday I injured my back
I went to the gym to the gym and then I injured my back and then bila I balik
no one week ago so ya so one week ago I tak warm up lah it was really stupid I forgot to warm up and then I just angkat berat then I felt like macam a sharp pain in my back then I was like oh no
so I thought I thought macam okay okay is it because I'm sore asal asal macam susah ini I feel like everything feels heavier and more I I feel like everything was sore I thought okay maybe
be sakit lah then macam I really messed up like aiya something is wrong lah this not normal this not like normal soreness it's like probably a sprain or a strain on my back tapi I continue whatever I can but lepas I balik I had a class lah and then during the class I told them I will be lambat sikit because
I am moving very slowly so be like my neighbour macam this slow then I I drop my soap and I couldn't bend to pick it back up
kind of thing so macam so when I joined the class they were very understanding sorry I joined the class usually kita will jumpa about half an hour before the kids come in so I came in about twenty minutes before the kids come in lah so it's still okay
and then macam um I told them about it and then eventually I think after the class she told my um how to say my not my supervisor lah she told my
superior about it not the like the boss boss but the the girl who was like training us and everything so the girl told me that saturday tak payah so macam you have to clock in a certain number of hours for training before we become like a you know a full time like teacher
jadi on saturday she told me uh tak payah kerja because ya she she told me to like rest and then friday that friday also I was supposed to go to the gym cause I had a training
tapi I tak pergi cause my back sakit so I was like okay lah okay lah
ya tapi
ya then after that I thought okay just rest lah macam take this opportunity to rest so I rest tapi lepas itu macam tak baik-baik ini pun macam tak baik-baik and then macam it hurts when I sneeze so I thought alamak ini macam not macam bukan tak normal kan ya
ya so I told my coach semalam yang it hurts when I sneeze so she said mm she's worried that is a nerve thing rather than a muscle thing so I started to panic and then she was like oh maybe you should go sebab kalau pergi the only thing a will do is give painkillers
so she was like I think you might need to see a sports doctor you can like to get an or something so I was like tak nak so she was like okay lah then macam tengok chiro or like uh get a sports massage lah so I tried making an appointment with my other coach who does like bekam
and sports massage cause I read like bekam can help with like nerve macam you know what if your nerve macam err nerve pinching I feel like sometimes you macam you your muscle you pull your muscle then your nerve like gets pinched or something so macam it's apparently bekam can help with that and macam
ya bekam can help you with that I takut sakit tak have you tried it before
oh did she say if tak sakit eh
mm you free kan dekat gambas that's where my other gym is
uh dekat sembawang there got another branch this gym has another branch in the east I think my the coach that um has is qualified to do like the massage and the bekam is dekat will be at the gambas one on monday
err she asked me if I can make it at two thirty then after that she belum reply I so I tak tahu belum confirm ah tapi
itu pasal she haven't reply so I said okay how long is the session and how much is it so macam
so no reply but I read on on the website is like sixty minutes and then macam what she will do depends on your condition so macam either I mean you can ask for her to bekam lah if you that's what you want macam mana otherwise she will uh base it base her like you know on her professional opinion whether you need a massage or a bekam or like some mobility work ah
mm tapi I think she buat bekam angin if I'm not wrong cause I think I saw a video of her doing bekam on instagram can send you
no it looks like the angin one like ada macam after she put the cup like she pull something mm then the thing macam suction
go for the darah one
oh so the dia macam slightly different how to say
err like bekam angin versus bekam darah macam target slightly different things lah gitu
oh the dekat rumah dia is it
oh I ada macam hundred around there standard right that's like standardish I guess
um like consultation dia sahaja dah
macam hundred she's really really good it's really good like if you ever have like a sports injury or a injury you got from like
uh tapi ya she she's a private doctor lah so very mahal like she sees a lot of like national athletes and stuff so her rates are like consultation sahaja hundred plus then macam if you go x-ray everything then it just adds up so like
ya so I'm thinking about I'm thinking massage atau bekam dulu lah I mean kalau it's not like
no ah abeh sekarang sekarang my kaki sakit dah lah belakang sakit kaki sakit because I pergi gym
for training yesterday kan then uh certain things aqilah lah like macam you know she
uh macam certain things she made me take it easy which was frustrating for me to take things I mean it it's not frustrating to me to take things easy in all other aspects of my life but when it comes to lifting you know macam I feel like my ego I have like macam like it's frustrating lah
like all the progress I've made gone so macam the the weight the weight the group that I was doing it with so we were we were progressing at the same pace so they are moving on to like eighty kilos ninety kilos yesterday and I was like thirty kilos
I was struggling because macam nak angkat sahaja sakit then the moment I felt like that stabbing pain I'll just like I scared lah so it's like cannot cannot cannot cannot
ya and then tapi semalam ada sekarang my kaki sakit because my mother this like finisher thing that we had to do so macam like thirty squats like thirty sets of squats so macam
oh really ah tuesday I still have like um today tomorrow monday three days for me to recover plus I'm going for massage on monday so unless the massage makes like more sakit then I'll let you know
I mean it it won't right like you don't have we don't have to like after bekam there's no like rule to not do any physical activity kan I mean kita jalan sahaja
so kalau kita I mean kita hiking right we're not it's not like we're gonna climb a mountain or anything it's okay if we're just walking it's good good for you movement is good I think for like you know aches and pains
oh my god my laughter is so cringe nanti orang transcribe
macam kita ketawa-ketawa abeh nanti all the haha hehes that kena transcribe I I cannot transcribe my own voice also lah can hardly listen to my own voice it's so cringey like it's it's so weird like you you don't sound like how you think you sound
oh anyway apa itu so
have you seen the list uh list pula have you seen the website yang I hantar
I don't know eh macam the jinx tak lah
I mean mana-mana pun ada so it's me lah
ya but most of them are so far for you I think hillview is like the how to say dekat situ ada banyak trails I feel cause that's the nature reserve area
your areas ada ke other trails macritchie is it wait no sembawang area
ya that's true actually like if you want to cycle but well I can't cycle and now I just announced it apa nak cakap eh okay we can look at more sites lah think got more options tapi yang yang at the the one I sent you to mm kita ada the lower pierce reservoir park
and then there's the sungei buloh wetland reserve need ini dekat mana eh kranji hopefully doesn't rain though you know speaking of
oh this one got stairs don't want malas they were like don't forget to wear comfortable shoes because you will be climbing some stairs
oh tapi is it like a like a mainstream park then everywhere knows about
she is married and I think she's doing like transcribing right now but full time like sort of that time ingat tak yang kita pergi makan
yang kita makan mukshidonna oh ya so she was talking about that
not officially tapi like you know sometimes when we hang out and then like he meets up with her when we're going home I thought he fetches her and stuff like he's nice lah he just seems macam very shy a bit macam shy lah I mean like a group of girls then kita kan kecoh so I think maybe it's a bit awkward for him but ya
ya and very macam considering he's quite young he's very macam independentish macam financially independent like ya like matured lah matured
because err I assume her house I mean her house is big kan so I think and her room is big so I think macam he moved in with her lah
and padahal and I think in a way not that it always makes sense for the girl to move in with the guy until they can find a house tapi macam is easier pakai tudung leceh you know if you were like
I mean brother then okay lah I don't know whether he has brothers or not but like you know brother or someone else then she has to keep wearing tudung
ya ya ya I feel like sometimes it tends to be like that because macam how to say the mother runs the house some sometimes lah like you know in most situations like you know she if she's a housewife especially then macam if the wife is also like a
I don't know like you know you might you know feel a bit ya I get what you mean tapi macam less of an issue kalau if the guy moves into the house cause he
uh ya that's true I feel like macam there's that expectation lah double standards a bit ya
not working ya because like oh perempuan kerja apa sahaja perempuan kerja you know sometimes they say things like that ya so it's makes it tough
especially macam your in your industry that you are working in like things change very fast
so macam if you come back after a few years then you're like uh you know some cause maternity leave is not enough like
just the maternity leave okay say it's like three months right around there is it not then after that four months okay then like is a four month old baby someone have to take care kan then it it might fall to the parents that's not fair so macam if you want to raise the kid until the age where the kid is like relatively
you know not independent independent but you know like of you know of the age where macam dah besar sikit then at least school age school going age you know
siapa lah
where there's me then baru ada
hmm dah macam dah macam project
hmm tak suka
I suka especially family friends boyfriend girlfriend husband all don't mix together
tourist stuff dekat Sentosa
wait but you dah beli belum dia punya ticket
cari online ah I think ada yang ada twenty five per cent off eh
it's not so much the beach lah because you all are going to macam tempat tempat the attraction right
that's at Marina Bay punya tempat
you know the one yang kita pergi Marina Barrage itu hari oh because you took Jihan punya car um
before you sampai Marina Barrage before you turn ya it will be but I also never go to satay satay by the bay before
ada air-con tak
alah are you going malam or pagi
oh ya ya ya ya your friend ya your friend did that right tapi tu buat sendiri ke atau
yang your own is
oh tak de tentage ah
sebab kalau nak tentage you can take mine
orh ya lah I mean is at one corner lah if that's what you want kalau you nak orang tak kacau then okay lah
ours was quite open dia exposed ah so
uh given the circumstances I think that's not bad lah but I think I saw some of them duduk dekat nearer to the lift area that one tak kena panas sangat
but pernah tak
ya kalau tak pernah then better don't
Seah Im kat luar lah park kat luar
no no no I think you shouldn't tell him jangan bawa motosikal because if he doesn't bring his bike then dia rasa macam
asal eh normally we ya
but muka girlfriend dia muka poker face tak is it she can ah
following each other's plan can but kalau the partner like me like that last minute say don't want ah I want today I got I got cramp ah I decide not to go to Sentosa then habis
because marina barrage dia punya jauh tau
because because Sentosa tak ada kereta senang that one you just take the monorail pay one entrance fee and you can take
I seriously think that's a good idea too because Sentosa nak keluar pun leceh
cable car then yang Carlsberg tu
yang pusing pusing the thing that pusing
then apa sia yang lima
I went I don't think I've been to the one yang dekat Singapore
Hong Kong I went to Bangkok tak salah eh with my husband once
but ya you share with me ah I also want to see eh since my staycation dah kena cancel kan so
ya then you make him jalan also
but I'm pretty sure dia penat from going for kelas mengaji okay that's wrong but
dia kat mana dia dekat  bukan Tampines
because kalau daripada Tampines actually it's a bit more difficult lah dia kalau daripada west area lagi senang kan
I see oh it's not like she go and jumpa him somewhere and then they
yeah ni macam papa lah
oh last entry dia bukan tutup last entry
bukan tutup so that means uh last
last entrance normally tutup one hour later ah
I don't like to be the one who has to surprise the birthday person because susah you really have to macam tak de
tak ada secrets out
berapa orang sia
for eleven that's mahal leh
um nasi goreng tom yum
you have to see you know whether you have to make oh but because it's a hawker centre tak yah buat reservation ah
habis lah
I think kalau
potluck ah macam picnic style ah
ya if satay by the bay let's say penuh nak mams kan then you find in that area apa lagi kedai makan [ah]
cuma now we are not at Sentosa if you at Sentosa then ada banyak options ah
dekat Vivo banyak apa makanan
no oh my god dorang ni
nasib Zaki beli berapa banyak water bottle dia beli I think about
enam tujuh ada mineral water
because now the weather like sekejap panas sekejap sejuk
sekejap panas then the next thing hujan
oh dia kulit tebal lah
korang tiga orang aje eh
no si
Shad sama sama group kan
okay okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah dia macam one committee and then within the committee ada macam sub sub group ah
I can so dengan dia
ya ya ya ya ya ya I can see the long hair guy right dia punya muka macam
ya ya ya you told me also lah it hit on the wrong timing you say if it's next month maybe boleh consider lah
then kau sorang serious ah
ya that one we got no other eh unless you want to bring the the bapa and the anak and the
that time ah I see my friend pergi
like err kosong the whole you know where the
the one that they always do uh free dance dia macam dance on the road gitu
dia ada the road ah
that one dia pergi kosong lah
oh ya ya no I saw that picture first then you told me dia orang kena buang kerja
don't know I don't know you pay me also belum tentu I naik
like you know the restaurant yang no the restaurant yang ada kereta kereta tu lah the vintage car
cannot cannot be I tak kerja right I think baru start kerja kot
was it was it berapa bulan ah
oh I belum pakai tudung so that means yeah ya ya I belum pakai tudung so I think it's like the end of two thousand fifteen
first trimester is supposed to be like uh they say what belum melekat yet
the flower one dah habis
rezeki don't tolak
rezeki dah ketuk kat pintu knock knock knock open the door and then you're not opening the door
orh dia tak kaku dia tak awkward lah
wait dia bukan jumpa kat sekolah
lurus bendul lah that that long hair guy right I don't know he just give me the vibe that he's or maybe because you influenced my
not lurus bendul I think dia tak nonsense ah
uh lurus
and that's the reason why dia kena avoid orang orang yang macam hypocrite
a bit meh panas baran
no no this this is what that darah muda
yeah I feel like my son have grown up you know dah besar anak mak
once dia masuk primary school ah
you bloom into a minah or you bloom into a nerd or you bloom into someone right that's the start of how you dictate what kind of
yeah I took a nerd path come on then balik lambat
apa people okay so in general people will think I'm one of those wild student okay balik lambat pukul tujuh pukul lapan
bila sia the only time I hang out with my friends is I walk from school to from home to school
I jumpa kat Tampines mart
you know the McDonald's punya carpark masuk right ya ya ya ya
and then it's like auto know like the momemt we see each other okay come come jalan
not like macam accident every day also like that that one not accident already
I think he after awhile he gave up on us when he closed the door he sengaja he never
maybe I don't know less than hundred meter away he saw us already he tutup
then we run to the main gate masuk
no no no I cannot study at home nanti pergi library ah oh standard
sampai library pukul sepuluh lari book seat
sampai pukul dua belas dua belas lebih satu between that time
dinner after after study at night we go for supper huh tengok
 macam mana badan tak naik
I will black blank out if you tell me besok I told you what I called my mum
uh hello mah then she said ah ada apa
asal Qin
lepas recess ada ada test I didn't study
you stay back right kalau ada your you do after school hours right
apa eh apa eh I buat
I buat I buat acrylic that's why I'm thinking apa acrylic yang I buat I did something
we even have a apa
dah buat dah buat uh okay for example there's
dah buat maths dah buat science dah buat geography belum
art you dah okay and then the other person oh aku belum buat ni okay okay okay okay uh it when is your class we copy later then we do rotation ah
okay finish now siapa nak dah habis siapa nak
uh apa dorang panggil
there is there is I I'm not officially on there but uh apa I represented
so basically kat batu dorang buat macam it's something like chess ah dorang buat ni yeah
he didn't allow us to go in tutup
let's go cabut cabut come let's
cabut I said ya so we took step you know step step by step by step
the first guy said naik naik naik naik we went out
maju lah she she's
uh ya ya ya nevermind so we took our time lah since dah kena marked also right we
I think second last day ya then we walk okay ah kena buat detention first time in my life ah kena detention know then I was like
and then you thought it's something serious right mental health lah kesian budak ni ah bila bila bila
eh tak kan mesti lah miss travelling travelling is one of the best thing that I think
kita nak buat buat seh
um you mean before COVID where I wanted to travelling atau lepas COVID nak pergi mana
kalau before COVID
um I won't say most value for money tapi dekat
um dengan dia lawa
ya tu ah I think ah that time I pergi in twenty
sixteen tu I pergi um
okay ah I tak I didn't get to enjoy
tapi sekarang yang kita dah pernah go camper van dekat dengan go
uh australia I rasa kalau kita dapat camper van kat new zealand
confirm lawa gila ah
tu ah tapi ya lah macam macam ah jadi kalau macam
kita punya camper van berlubang
sydney to melbourne compared to tasmania okay lah tasmania best lah sebab dapat naik the ocean liner kan travel from melbourne to tasmania tapi
um sydney dengan sydney to melbourne because we had another group another friend
family yang follow jadi
rasa macam best ah sebab you enjoy more with them
ya lepas tu yang kita you makan kat perfect catch
tu pun best ah fish and chips by the river power sia
I think one of the best memories of fish and chips compared to punya fish and chips fish and chips
punya lah tak sedap
ya I went to new zealand dengan my aunties lah and my cousins
err well uh bila you pergi dengan um makcik-makcik ah dia orang punya level of err worry is more because they feel that they are responsible lah for you
I tahu ah tapi bila you dah dengan makcik-makcik I
err dia orang dah eh tak mahu lah tak mahu lah
dia dah pergi counter dah pergi bayar
alih-alih he was walking on the platform
it must be ticked are you fit ada sakit apa-apa tak you got heart disease or not et cetera et cetera benda-benda macam gini semua biasa lah kena fill
so they give you a cert lah to say that yes I am brave enough to have attempted this and nah ambil kau punya cert
so kita dalam kat new zealand maybe about one or two
my cousin and kita pergi pub
tak tak minum ah eh ah kita pergi pub ordered hot chocolate
kita pergi pub pergi pub err hot chocolate tengok bola kat luar
tapi sejuk malam tu sejuk sebab dia hujan it was raining
um and then bila esok pagi
sekali tiba-tiba um snow fell
lepas tu bila when there was snow err we were kind of hold in because the snow was quite heavy
um the advisory was tak boleh drive on the road dulu
and then um apparently for that year there was one of the heaviest snow yang christchurch um felt
after maybe about what eighteen years so macam lama gila ah lama tak boleh snow macam gitu
ya betul I think that was the first time I rasa snow
err unique experience ah sebab
tak pernah nampak snow kan so
ya ya ya we memang kita tahu it was winter so we brought the I mean for me at least I brought jacket and gloves lah
err not for snow but I mean just winter kita tak tahu pun there was snow that was gonna happen
it was only fun until we realised that we were stuck in christchurch maksud tak boleh pergi mana-mana
the tour company decided okay nevermind we err board the bus and lepas tu drove to another hotel
and um ya we basically tidur kat hotel baru
tapi yang tak bestnya pasal new zealand
um winter obvious sejuk lepas tu
winter sejuk lepas tu pukul lima petang semua benda dah habis
semua benda semua kedai dah tutup then so it was quite boring lah for for us especially us youngsters
and then we realize that wow at five I'm back at the hotel doing nothing but tengok so it was kind of boring ah but fortunately I think we were stuck only for
one one one extra night ke two extra night
so hot chocolate ah sedap
tu bukan lah tu some pumpkin spice kan
dekat queen victoria market kan
ah eh tu biasa pasal kita terus makan donut dia kat luar
wah camper van experience lain eh I think
mm ya lah I think by then kita orang macam dah penat I mean we were driving
almost the entire day and then uh by the time nightfall kita dah nak cari tempat saje lepas tu nak nak makan until we didn't even have time to think about having phones to just snap a photo but that was surreal lah having wildlife a wombat benda yang
tak pernah nampak kat singapore tiba-tiba nak panjat masuk camper van
melampau jer
ya tu pasal lah
kita tak akan dapat experience benda-benda macam ini sebab tours chances are
ya and I think um partly why I really enjoyed the camper van life sebab
sebab your time is yours
I think yang even on that trip lah yang we kita turun tengok the river delta kan ya
tu ah tak tak sabar tunggu ni COVID habis
lepas COVID first destination when they say borders are now open first destination lah I'm don't even wanna go
ya tapi kalau you can fly everybody else also wants to fly and then all the all the
jadi kita kasih lah orang yang nak fly fly dulu lepas tu bila tiket dah murah baru kita pergi
kita pergi apa yang kita mampu jer iaitu K
ya tapi okay so there are two ways to go about doing it biasa orang drive
lepas tu tidur rest one night and then esok pagi just sambung pergi border of thailand
ya that one more relax ah takde kelam kabut takde macam rushing for time
drive ke tidur semalam
lepas tu ah pergi penang
nanti lah belum buka tengah tinggi sekarang belum dengar
selangor tengah highest for COVID numbers
ya so boleh ah lepas tu lepas dah tidur satu malam pergi penang satu malam baru pergi thailand tapi tu dah kira dua hari ah
kalau nak cepat then tidur penang satu hari esok kita pergi thailand ataupun lagi nak cepat terus to thailand ah tapi penat ah badan sebab it will probably be macam
empat belas jam on the road ah so if you are at fourteen hours on the road you'll be tired ah
what's your objective is our objective driving to thailand and then back or the objective is to explore the southern part of thailand kalau the objective is to explore southern part of thailand
lepas tu travel around southern thailand
err I don't know ah tak pernah try tapi jangan bawa kereta ah jangan bawa kereta in
you sewa kereta dekat thailand
kalau bawa kereta sendiri then you might as just I mean I don't know just travel all the way but
but it's tiring lah so what I want is kita save ourselves the trouble of driving all the way from singapore ah
naik kapal terbang nak sangat kan kapal terbang ah naik ah kapal terbang
okay lah memang best lah tak cakap tak best tapi
tak lah bruny boring lah kirakan macam boat dia kecil apa
oh tu juga
bukan bunker lah cabin lah
okay lah tapi malam we kita tak travel malam so you were travelling at
I mean bila kita baru-baru masuk when the boat started to sail
by the time kita dah tertidur boat dia probably
took a slightly more I mean the seas were ruffled lah kan when I think there were some points in time where we could feel their boat swing but because we were too tired and dah dah dah tertidur kita pun tak rasa sangat lah
then bila pagi dah bangun
lain okay lah I mean dia orang jual benda yang ada dekat sini juga tapi I think because of the space that they have
and harga tak so mahal lah
ya because they are fresh produced ah benda-benda segar tu rasa lebih sedap
memang lah
tapi tu ah since
oh dapat dia orang yang burger ni macam best ah
okay sabar which one do you prefer you lagi suka van diemen's punya ice cream ke you lagi suka gelato messina
van diemen's was ya betul-betul yang kat situ sebuah farm
macam-macam ah gelato messina ada macam-macam flavour
tapi yang amorino punya
amorino punya I think kita makan
kejap I tak ingat whether that one were trip ke
ah tak salah tu ah
ya I like messina better sebab I rasa
ya tu yang best dia ah
because kalau you you compare van diemen's van diemen's punya flavours are
it's not anything out of the ordinary lah macam K you got your vanilla you got your coffee or your chocolate double chocolate kind of thing
kan atau
K lah apple cranberry pun boleh katakan
ada apa yang dekat tu dekat tom's palette
okay tom's palette ke gelato messina
ya ke
but then tom's palette sedap seh
tapi it could also be the fact that
benda tu kita tak pernah try ah contoh eh contoh
when we went to borong market alright K break your head right
I I wouldn't say that sebab dulu dunkin donut pernah ada with their bavarian cream
tapi the the ones that dunkin donut jual tak sesedap ah
ya okay so kalau you imagine ah break your head you punya donut the dough is soft
inti dia penuh kan
which I am inclined to agree sebab about I haven't tasted
tak pada I macam lebih pada okay like
I felt that it was a cross between lemak cili padi dengan uh apa thai green curry
ada lah iras-iras dia
dah dah lepas tu I found out that that lady who sold the brownies she appeared on dragon's den ah dragon's den dragon's den is this uh british show
investors yang ada duit bangsa duit melambak shark tank ah macam shark tank ah
so dragon's den dengan shark tank lebih kurang ah sama ah
I I not I can't remember exactly whether they gave her the funding or not ah but the fact that you made it to dragon's den and you were shortlisted kirakan you bagus ah
ya okay think about it eh kalau you kata you miss the food overseas
no lah just wondering whether you have because right now when we're here we're we're back in singapore you cakap oh I miss the food overseas
then I realize that okay lah when travel kita tak selalu makan luar kita selalu masak most of the time
so when you say you miss the food it's those times that we ate outside for example macam
macam makan kat noodle noodle or is it oodle oodle
right like like mi dengan
ya so if you were to think about it again macam is it really that fantastic
ah tu ah faham tak
ya it's the spices sebab dia orang okay imagine nandos
so nandos kan macam oh nak kena duduk kat dalam kedai dia macam up sikit
kan ada sudu garfu
that thick milkshake sedap gila
tak boleh replicate ah eh so far
and it was a quaint it was a quaint non assuming shop kita masuk
K ah penat saje nak duduk
and baam sedap gila apa tempat ni
betul juga okay lah maybe I think oh what was
was so enjoyable when you shop at the ni lah factory outlets
tapi tu bicester village elite ah up ah
bicester ke bister
bukan bicester eh
ya but I think the york punya outlets err better ah
york yang kita punya kita punya camper van um battery mati
tak yang job dia
ah kita dah
so kita travel all the way up untuk pergi york
that's true lah tapi macam travel untuk two hundred plus three hundred plus kilometre just for that macam mm
ah tak ada theme park ah
float apa
bukan luga kan
tapi tu mahal ah I rasa
mahal lah I think
tak salah adults
fifty alah fifty australian fifty sing ni lebih kurang sama ah
maze kat sana ah
haunted house apa
eh itu mengarut seh
eh tu mengarut gila buang buang masa saya pergi tu
ya lah tak menyeramkan langsung
sabar ni trip ke err
is partly because of the weather kan they humid tapi dia panas ah
so walaupun masuk hutan err I mean you got your you got your forest cover tree covers and what not
tapi bila kat dalam panas juga ah sebab takde angin ah
compared to bila kita travel dekat you ingat tak yang kita pergi tasmania
cari waterfall
yang kita cari waterfall tu kan
oh ya K ah at least bila kat dalam sana
dia sejuk sikit oh
cuaca dia orang memang sejuk so kita tak rasa sangat ah
kalau nak pergi taman negara berpuluh lawa ah saya confirm
err at that time two thousand eight tak salah tengah euro euro two thousand eight ya tu ah euro two thousand eight lah
ya kalau kalau travel as a student
how much you are going to spend so macam for us while kita pergi sana we either just took the
atau kita ambil um kita ambil apa the the budget flight ah
so we were from netherlands kita travel to belgium via bus
kita dah terlepas the the public bus which brings us to the airport and that the airport is actually about
jauh I think was sixty kilometres away
belgium is belgium lah mana belgium is germany
so kita terlepas so konon-konon nak naik taxi ah the bus two hundred foreign nightmare thanks ah ya
tak juga ah we were winging it lah
ah ya so the story is we managed to hail down a cab lepas tu
kita cakap dengan pakcik ni ah driver we need to get to this airport so dia kata that sixty kilometres away
at least macam
so you macam dah alamak macam mana eh but the worst part is that we will we had no money ah there was I think we only had one hundred and twenty euros
no bukan takde duit lah but
not that much cash on hand so if we spend the if we spend the money on this taxi trip that means untuk benda-benda lain kita kurang lah kan
habis bila dia nak cakap dengan kita hundred and this one ah more than hundred twenty euro habis kita dah duit dah sikit then kita macam alamak macam mana eh
he said okay whatever that money you all got nevermind you all give me but I will switch on my meter and nanti I will show you all
dia saje nak tunjuk dengan kita kita punya trip ni lagi mahal lah
ya lah I I think sama ah macam benda ini juga so dia on
dia on dia punya meter
so he went all the way up up up we haven't still haven't reach but the meter dah naik two hundred three hundred and twenty twenty euros
lepas tu he said
ya and then dia kata okay you look ah at the meter
sekarang dah hundred three hundred and twenty euro aku off K aku off
ya starting tu dah adventure ah
no but I think kalau spain kalah confirm raih ah
ah but because spain won err I think I think through penalties eh spain menang italy and then ah because of that they made it to the final
we watched you watched that so the um there was a big screen dia orang err live telecast
so kita ramai-ramai ah kat sana sama tengok live telecast lah
the trains tutup sia
jalan ah
ah jalan ah so tak ni lah ni dah madrid ah ni dah madrid so madrid dah macam
lepas portugal so kita pergi
so it was netherlands lepas tu ambil bus pergi belgium belgium flight to portugal portugal pergi um flight to madrid
all the way makan ni ah roti dengan tuna ah
tak lah everyday but basically living frugally ah
um my friend and I lah kita dah dah dah lapar ah
so kita turun kat kedai muslim ni kita kebetulan found a muslim shop which was nearby
you go through your hostel dot com ke apa ah
so um jumpa ah kedai kedai muslim ni ah semua muslim brother dah masuk kedai dia apparently kita ternampak ada prata ah
prata ah so macam prata ah
so I don't know whether it was ah an instant prata or prata that they made ah tapi nampak macam prata ah
so my friend and I eh baik ah this harapan prata puas hati lah kan
tu kita dah tengah lapar so kita minta dia enam ah enam eh kau tiga aku tiga lah enam
itu tak perasan lah sebab kita dah tengah lapar ah and harga dia harga tak mahal sangat lah
true dah tengah lapar ah so kita dah okay ah enam enam enam sekali pakcik tu tengok kita macam kau orang biar betul enam sabar sabar sabar and he couldn't speak english
ah macam gitu ah so dia ah sabar sabar sabar kau ambil dua dulu dua dulu
then macam kita cakap tak tak tak enam enam tak tak kau ambil dua dulu kau dengar
apparently dia orang makan order prata dengan macam sirap ke gula ah
tak I think they tuang the sugar on top ah
so kita dua-dua tak habis sebab manis gila nasib baik
tu pasal lah dia ni dia ni kira macam muslim brother boleh pakai punya ah
and then uh you know how the spaniards pride pride themselves with their siesta ya so there was one day kita keluar um maybe like after one or after the two
ya like they I think the shops mostly will close like one to four ke two to five ah
so it's okay lah as in dia orang tutup sekejap for them to rest lepas tu dia orang buka sampai maybe sepuluh sebelas
oh err in madrid juga I where where when we were walking ah masih masih masih
sekali tiba-tiba there was this bangladeshi guy
kita dah kat madrid eh dia orang bual bual melayu eh muka bangladesh berbual melayu lepak
ada pernah kerja kat malaysia
I mean if the opportunity presents itself nak lah kan
kalau ada kerja yang bagus okay ah
ah lepas tu dah langgar langgar sana I mean
kalau kita kat singapore kalau bulan puasa kan macam
okay babe I ada soalan I nak tanya you kalau COVID nineteen benda ni semua dah selesai
kita tak perlu susah payah nak quarantine ke nak stay home notice ke nak risau tentang leave kita cukup ke tidak you rasanya you nak pergi mana holiday kalau boleh
bulan bulan march err tahun ni ke atau tahun
oh tahun ni
oh okay tapi you dah beli air ticket ke belum
AirAsia ke Singapore Airlines
oh okay tapi kalau depa dah refund sepatutnya okay lah
I ada dengar juga kawan I cakap AirAsia tak boleh refund langsung atau partial refund atau
you know maybe they will just macam postpone lah their trip sampai tak tahu lah bila
tapi kalau okay japan ni you pernah pergi ke tidak atau ni kali pertama
mm dah lima kali okay
so then tapi okinawa is first time atau bukan
ya so I rasa macam kalau boleh kan quarantine ni dah selesai tak perlu susah payah macam ni sangkut dalam rumah
I nak pergi jumpa boyfriend I sebab
kan kita ni memang long distance relationship dah kan tapi lapan bulan dah tak jumpa
kalau boleh I nak gi perth lah sebab I rasa macam
perth ni bila I gi kat situ um
selalunya rasa macam very peaceful
kacau I
so I can like eat and sleep and relax or maybe because I'm on leave juga lah
so tak rasa macam stressed sangat
oh betul ke tapi australia you pernah pergi ke tak
okay boleh juga ajak you lah ah okay lah
so ya so I pernah pergi ke sydney sekali
melbourne sekali yang dua-dua kali dengan mum I lah dengan my mak
sekali dengan mak I juga and then I've been to perth I think this time dah kira the third time lah
next year kalau boleh I nak gi lah tapi
because sekarang
kan australia punya borders err rasa rasanya dalam Berita Harian  dah tertulis
they tutup sampai
tahun twenty twenty one
oh betul ke and you tak pernah visit
you should you should so then macam mana dengan
person that suka holiday suka keluar err
for new adventure tengok new adventure see new things so during
err tahun ni kan semasa lockdown uh semasa COVID you ada rasa macam you
you suffocating a bit ke tak like you know um like you cannot go on holiday you ada rasa macam mana
during circuit breaker at that time I was renting my room dengan ni house mates I
and at that time there was like five of us in the house so tak rasa macam lonely sangat lah
because sebelum ni kan
you memang tahu I tak tahu
memasak langsung so I didn't know how to cook um nasi pun tak tahu lor so then it's like
susah sikit lah
then I had to macam ask
I was very lucky that during the lockdown I tinggal dengan mereka lah at that time ah
boleh boleh makan lah but then there was this one time bila I masak uh kari ikan
salmon salmon I okay boleh makan tapi curry dia I think sebab I added too much water
so rasa dia macam air instead of or is rasa dia macam salmon soup instead of salmon curry lah
hais you tahu tak hari tu because I'm thinking to myself
that you ni kan memang drive and I take public transportation
so I was thinking hari tu kan you know outside rumah I ni I was sleeping very soundly by myself and you know just
dia accident
betapa kuatnya I heard bang
and I was like apa jadi ah
look out the window but then tak nampak apa apa then kawan I ternampak
memang yang accident tu teruk lah dengan motosikal
then kereta depan dia memang hempas sampai the whole thing is spoilt lah
kemek already crash already lah
ya so then after that few minutes later you can terdengar lah ambulance tu
ah betul
mm betul tapi you pernah kena accident tak
so far pernah
okay pas tu
wah kereta dia terbakar
I rasa macam I ada nampak
video tu kan I think ya no bukan nampak kereta dia kat tampines tapi I think I rasa I nampak video dia kat TikTok
sebab biasanya usually kalau ada accident kat singapore ke apa apa yang terjadi dia akan upload dalam TikTok
so macam tu lah so talking about the news um do you follow tak the the punya politician semua
mm I nampak tapi I macam tak faham
faham lah
sepatutnya I nak pergi shopping tapi I rasa macam hais
you know kena save money lah
and then you know uh tapi I rasa macam the houses here pun sekarang
getting more expensive and kalau tak I kena you know buy like somewhere further away from the city and it's not convenient sebab I tak pandu kereta kan
so macam tu lah eh you ada siblings ke tak
oh I tak tahu pun you ada siblings
okay so your big brother buat apa
tak ada lah I ni kan only child
so that's why that's why like you know my parents I kena take care of them lah
so that's why during this COVID nineteen time I worried sikit lah sebab kan they are walking around in singapore
I takut lah kalau ada apa apa yang jadi especially bila that time when the domestic workers the numbers were increasing and
you tahu lah parents ni tua-tua yang semua tua-tua ni kan
bila kita bagi tahu jangan keluar dari rumah sebab sekarang ni kan COVID dangerous especially if you are high risk
risiko tinggi kan jangan lah keluar sebab
macam diabetes high cholesterol
err like macam mak I she's had a stroke before it's it's dangerous lah to to bahaya lah to go out
things in public kan and taking the public transport and dia ambil juga
so that's why memang tak nak dengar lah so susah sikit lah so like I was very worried for my parents but then it looks like
the numbers here in singapore is dwindling is is sudah semakin kurang
so nampaknya macam okay we're getting better
but then you tahu tak what is the difference between phase three dengan phase two sebab I tak tahu
yang tu jer
tapi I rasa macam activity tu not so important actually the ones that is more important to me is the travelling part lah
ah betul juga
but then like travel bubble kalau you boleh cadangkan travel bubble you rasa travel bubble dengan siapa
you get to pick five countries yang mana lima country yang you rasa you nak
you nak travel bubble dengan
tapi philippines dengan indonesia I would be very afraid
because philippines is uh dengan indonesia
ya because the two of them sekarang ni memang tengah competing and then philippines competing to be the winner
so rasa macam I don't I would not feel safe kalau we have travel bubble dengan mereka
ah new zealand new zealand is good ya memang cantik and I heard the prime minister is very good also mm
so ya I heard she has been doing her very well with the number of the COVID nineteen cases lah di di negara dia kan
so macam tu lah so biasanya you ada baca news kan Channel News Asia
yang macam mana yang ada apa like
apa rapist siapa
dalam Channel News Asia they reported that oh my god that is so sad kan
esok uh kerja lah apa lagi aiyo so everytime
uh kerja memang kerja from work from home lah tapi once I think about kerja I macam stressed sikit because I've been working twenty four seven
so I rasa macam I need a break lah
I tak boleh visit rumah orang tua lah sia COVID
macam mana I nak visit orang tua tak boleh lah
malas lah I rasa macam I kat duduk kat rumah I sleep cukup
ya betul
everytime tak boleh tidur because got problems trying to sleep lah insomnia kan
mm but then I don't want to take too much ubat also I want to make sure that I can fall asleep naturally
my house mate kan dia balik
then dia tidur kat sini
boyfriend dia tak ada so boyfriend dia tinggal kat tempat dia sendiri lah so
managed to buy me McDonald's breakfast dia ada buy one for one
ah murah
so macam tu lah eh you tahu tak rambut I kan lepas I dye dia merah dah kan
warna dia when my rambut is wet kan warna dia masih like
terlekat kat pillow I
you know my hair ni memang kan red
so I rasa macam
the hair dye that the hairdresser used tak berapa bagus ah because everytime I after when it's wet it's wet
two weeks already and it's will still stain baju kau there is no way that the thing is still like that betul tak
ya exactly this is lepas dua minggu dah and then dia masih stain baju dengan
but only bila dia basah
so it stained like my towel juga lah stain stain merah
mana boleh kalau kering pun it's uh ya but it's
[ah] betul there ah
so but then ah dia beli lah during um during apa ni
Harvey Norman singapore ada sales
jadi dia beli dari Harvey Norman lah
ya it was a a birthday surprise dia order dari Harvey Norman singapore
Harvey Norman singapore tu deliver kat I lah mm and I didn't know then when they ring the doorbell I was like
there was memang kelakar lah because the guy was like this one is for you I said I didn't order this he said oh your mum
so macam tu lah
oh we said we wanted to go to apa ni
and then kita masih belum pergi Holey Moley kan
I pernah dah ajak tapi you sibuk apa
kawan I lah yang seorang lagi
a'ah betul
ya tapi I ajak you you tak reply
sebab I tanya you nak pergi ke tak
pas tu you kau tak reply
tak tahu lah you busy every day lah ada banyak kawan kau
ah betul
uh kalau cycling I pengsan
susah lah I cannot lah if you ask me to go and do all these things
mm betul
ah tak boleh lah exercise
I tahu tapi I you you kan tahu I ni memang malas
nanti gemuk lah
it's okay lah kalau I gemuk
memang lah
oh and then you tahu tak
like sekarang ni kan I memang nak invest in stocks tapi I tak tahu macam mana
do you invest in stocks ke tak
orh I nak tapi I tak tahu macam mana nak start
oh boleh ke
tapi I nak ah
so you dah invest lama ke
oh dah lama ke
because I because I masih muda lagi kan
so I ni kena like willing to take the risk lah
mmhmm betul betul
okay tapi I nak start dengan
okay bagus
tapi because
if you want to invest in the share market you kena apa ni you kena start an account with with your bank right
is it with your banks or bukan macam tu
so macam macam lah
ya kalau gitu pun
ha betul lah
tak ada lah
tak ada lah tak ada investment
sebab itu lah susah sikit that's why I need to start thinking about my future kan
then like worried about like money and then sekarang job I ni pun tak ada commission
so I kena that's why I sekarang ni sibuk nak cari back a sales job so that I can get a bit of commission
project project macam ini kalau kita ada lebih then I don't have to worry so much
kalau project project macam ni memang lah I nak join
so rasanya tak tahu lah kalau mm
the share market investment I memang interested lah but then like
memang nak ah sebab tu that's why originally I was saving up my money untuk apa ni um
untuk sebab I nak belajar sepatutnya
tapi tu juga memang mahal kat
enam puluh ribu lebih susah lah
I rasa macam kalau boleh I nak study medicine juga tapi medicine kan I was thinking should I actually like
so but then career change susah sikit because like
macam mana I nak career change where do I start even kan so kalau I nak buat medicine medicine pun mahal
medicine is kira kira kalau kita study dekat australia
yang tu boleh but then but then you need to have the other additional like training lah
ah other additional training kalau you study dekat australia boleh sebab I ada seorang kawan dia memang
dia study kat monash university and then dia doctor lah kat sini
but then medicine tu mahal lah so
these kind of things you need money also if you want to switch your career and how you want to start all over and get certified so susah sikit lah
tengok lah that's why I pun tak tahu
no it's okay yang tu is out of the window I tak mahu
I nak kerja untuk diri sendiri I nak make sure that you know the money in the bank is mine and that
I tak dependent lah on anybody
parents okay lah kan parents kat singapore macam tu lah
tapi susah sikit lah because you know memang
so when you have two old parents here in singapore you kena
tak tahu lah
ada lah tapi pun susah nak keluarkan so kena tengok lah macam mana
ya betul
so tengok macam mana lah
biasanya bapa yang tak nak pi holiday mak yang nak mak nak pi holiday lah mak pernah pi holiday juga mak I bawa dia pi
I bawa dia pi aiyo banyak tempat lah sebab the job before this kan memang I had to travel and at that time
tak ada COVID lagi tak ada uh tak ada restrictions for travelling so
rasanya I brought her to a lot of places I brought her to
mm mana lagi I brought her to
at first originally kita nak pi vietnam this year sepatutnya I nak bawa dia pi vietnam especially end of the year when it's cold
either vietnam ke chiang mai because she likes cold places lah
and then I wanted to take her to cold places that is not expensive tak terlalu mahal kan
so vietnam atau chiang mai lah tapi sekarang mana mana pun tak boleh pi
so susah sikit lah duduk rumah tengok Netflix jer lah
tak tahu lah
aiyo dia ni
bapa I pun satu suruh dia pi suruh dia pi holiday
johor pun dia tak nak pergi
ah so memang susah lah sikit
ya lah mak I pernah pernah lah she wanted to go via this
travel agency pi holiday tapi susah sikit lah kalau you pi with travel agency I takut
mm tapi kalau they travel with travel agent kan
bukannya mahal ke because they will bring you to all these touristy areas
that like you know that akan charge you like really high prices
so susah sikit bukan
even makanan juga dia bawa you tempat yang mahal
mmhmm betul
mmhmm betul lah
mm betul juga
lazarus island tu yang paling jauh I pergi ah duduk ferry tu pun I tertidur dalam ferry
oh betul ke you pernah pergi ke lazarus island oh
oh macam mana hari tu kau pergi
oh betul ke berpeluh
tapi hari tu bila I pi kan cuaca tu tak berapa baik
aku ambil umbrella tu abeh aku jalan from one from since the jetty
to the beach aku dalam umbrella tu sahaja
pas tu we were there only for one hour I dengan kawan I
kawan I ni lah kan dia yang ajak aku pi
then macam mana aku nak dia pun cakap ah tak apa tak apa
nanti tak akan hujan aku memang dah tanya dia aku tanya oh okay even though we have bought the ferry ticket
you nak tukar ke another day ah because
kan sekarang ni hujan lebat then we go there we cannot even picnic ke nak buat apa apa pun tak ada then umbrella pun kecil sangat
so then after that dia cakap tak apa tak apa hujan tak hujan akan err nanti dia akan
uh reda dah ah so kita continue with our trip anyway
so I cakap okay lah continue with our trip and then
enam orang lima orang sorry bukan enam
oh ya betul juga I terlupa lima orang ugh
nampak pula a'ah betul
ya kenapa pula I boleh terkira tambah seorang ah okay tak apa so ada lima orang kan
and payung tu memang kecil kecil ha
and then almost lah the wind blew away the payung and everything so end up we all just sat kat jetty tu waited for the ferry for two hours
ya tapi I memang suka bila dia cuaca tak berapa panas kan bila dia cuaca hujan I memang suka
kan I nak pergi tapi tengok lah kalau weekday I memang tak boleh sebab I kena ambil leave kalau weekend okay lah tapi weekend susah juga sebab I takut ramai orang lah
I ni memang kena clear leave tapi I tak nak ambil
I tak nak ambil leave on a on a weekday that is like a random day kan because I takut like
my boss will also kacau I
ah the the most strategic way of doing this is bila boss I
ah so dia tak akan kacau I
mm betul juga
mm so macam tu lah
huh you go all the way for a massage don't you think that's like really far away tak akan singapore tak ada massage kat sini
oh so biasanya you pandu kereta pergi situ bukan ambil uh apa ni ambil uh train lah
this neighbour of mine kan dia ni memang suka suka
buang sampah dia kat
luar the place where they are supposed to throw the rubbish bukan dalam chute tu tapi buang dekat luar
tak tahu lah and then uh
no or sometimes dia memang dah buka itu chute
so like tapi dia tak tutup properly so then or or they didn't push the rubbish properly into the chute all the way down
so bila I nak buang sampah when I bawa keluar I buka tu sampah tu masih ada kat situ
memang lah macam itu
ya so I wrote an email to management lah then I suruh management please remind everybody to
management cakap okay ah do you know who is in err who is the culprit
mana I boleh tahu hais ask me this kind of questions
macam tu lah
mm betul
minggu ni tak ada lah I nak tidur then I nak tengok Netflix
Netflix sekarang ni I nak tengok uh weekend ni I nak tengok enola holmes and then I nak tengok
I nak tengok
movie tu err kau rasa cinta
kau tak pernah dengar ke movie tu kau rasa cinta
ada lah movie ni popular
because I scared later I fall asleep lah when I tengok K drama
kau ada nampak video TikTok tu yang I bagi you tengok semalam tak
kelakar kan
ya I think I probably spend like six hours on TikTok I even like I ada pun uh send apa ni my job application to TikTok juga
I memang nak kerja dengan TikTok kalau TikTok nak hire I I memang nak
so technically kan I ni memang TikTok researcher dah
so kalau dia nak hire I I boleh cakap this is the amount of time I spend on your product I memang boleh join product you
tak nak lah
as if boleh jadi popular dengan TikTok bukannya senang sangat
tak ada lah
mana boleh senang lah cakap but then when you want to do it kan memang difficult a bit lah
memang uh okay I don't think my voice is merdu lah tapi tengok macam mana lah
malay song mm macam boleh juga tapi I rasa macam bila I cakap malay it's smoother lah kalau nyanyi malay not so
mm eh you tahu tak hari tu kan um
I pergi Holey Moley dengan norza kan I dah cakap tadi
this one seorang lelaki ni dia memang kerja kat situ as a waiter
then after that dia cakap kalau
uh if if he dia memang singaporean lah tapi dia ada relatives kat malaysia
budak melayu lah ni so then after that dia cakap oh um next time kalau you nak make booking kat Holey Moley for a table reservation ke apa you boleh call I lah
so dia ambil nombor I
then after that dia letak mm ah then then dia ambil nombor I then dia letak nombor dia dalam telefon I sebab telephone I memang ada kat
kat meja so then dia cakap eh you ambil lah nombor telephone I so next time kalau you nak reserve apa ke
you boleh call I so I cakap okay that's fine I'll do it
dia asyik text I
and I dah bagi tahu dia yang memang I dah ada boyfriend
and dia cakap oh
uh kalau dia dia cakap hari tu dia cakap apa ah
uh dia cakap oh
um bila you free
I nak bawa you keluar uh and then dia then dia cakap I nak bawa you keluar dengan Vespa I
Vespa dia then aku cakap um
kenapa I nak duduk Vespa kalau public transportation memang ada air con
then tapi ya so no lah but it's not just that it was like I dah memang dah bagi tahu yang I ada boyfriend
tapi dia masih muka tebal tau and then dia masih text I so I rasa macam
that's really weird so I I just straight up was like honest dengan dia and I bagi tahu lah that like
ah so I rasa macam dia tak ada boundary actually the thing was
I only save nombor dia sebab dia cakap
that kalau next time I nak reserve table I boleh call dia so I ingat like service dia bagus ke apa I wanted to write like a feedback on Facebook
kat Holey Moley yang dia ni memang baik ke apa
tapi turns out dia ni memang tak like like
asyik kacau I jer so I rasa macam a bit
mm macam tu lah
uh saya rasa I saya tak nak
I memang dah berterus terang I dah cakap I ada boyfriend
then after that dia ah then dia masih muka tebal lagi dia cakap oh
oh um I okay jer uh because dia cakap oh
um um so I would like to invite you for my birthday dinner then I'm I cakap
ah then aku rasa aku tanya dia only you and me
then dia cakap tak lah then they said uh then he said
dengan kawan kawan I
then dia cakap with a group of friends bukan you dengan I jer then the then he said
I tahu you you you tak you tak nak hang out one on one
tapi I okay jer
then I rasa macam the way he responded to it was very
it doesn't matter if you are okay with it ke tidak because you are
tapi kalau orang dah ada boyfriend atau girlfriend I don't think it's
ah so macam tu lah
then then aku tanya dia just you and I then dia cakap tak lah dengan kawan kawan I
tapi dia masih hari ni lagi ajak I pergi birthday dinner
pas tu I cakap
dia and then the way dia cakap kan
dia text I dia cakap oh
so I was but bukan I yang ajak dia keluar dia yang nak ajak I then I was like
mungkin you kena panggil uh then I said err maybe you just enjoy with your friends lah and have a good
pas tu dia cakap um
dia cakap err
bila I free
so it's like again you are coming back to that topic when I dah cakap
I memang dah tak bagi signal apa I tak uh it it's totally no signal it's disconnected
so I rasa macam it's just
ya but any way aku dah tak reply dia lah
ya betul juga
bukan lah dah pernah happen a number of times
no lah I mean uh no but anyway ya that was just off topic so coming back to this um apa ni COVID kan so um
in london COVID nineteen memang dah um
mm macam that time dalam kat australia
mm yang tu pernah happen dalam japan pun and then now they said that the
the virus dah mutate
betul juga but then only the young ones will have herd immunity the old ones would not be able to survive or the ones with underlying disease
so yang tu yang susah lah
mm tapi vaccine sekarang pun macam ada side effect
because I think sekarang ada tiga company yang tengah buat vaccine
no there is one that's Sanofi albert dengan AstraZeneca
Pfizer juga I think all of them are on board with that kot
sekarang ni albert memang memang apa ni uh memang aggressive to to do COVID because I nampak ada
for a number of um albert punya infectious disease department
ada lah tapi dia tak call I balik because I tak ada experience dalam infectious disease kot
mungkin boleh juga tengok macam mana lah
ada lah I think now they are busy with the campaign the presidential campaign it feels like I feel like this COVID thing has
yang U orang dengan dengan like
so that's why it turns out everybody pula yang terkena COVID
I rasa lah yang ni I rasa lah
ya betul
ya betul
betul lah
mm betul juga
but it's true I mean uh you know negara kita ni
memang lebih bagus lah
negara lain lain di southeast asia tapi negara kita ni memang
memang you know as much as what anybody else says negara kita ni memang terbaik
orang orang lain nak masuk negara kita untuk kerja kan orang malaysia ni
orang indonesia
orang china orang philippines kan ah
there err and memang ada semangat
nationality lah kat singapore
mm betul
ah ang moh tu apa ang moh
oh ang moh tu orang putih lah
oh okay okay ha betul lah
ya betul
jadi mungkin minggu ni kita nak pi botanical gardens ke tak
ya sebab I rasa
betul juga sebab I rasa macam botanical gardens ada satu cafe yang memang cantik
then dia ada like I pernah pergi dah lama dah um
and then dia ada yang rooftop tu memang glass rooftop and dia transparent and then boleh nampak everything
bukan Wildseed Wildseed ke kat botanical gardens bukan Wildseed tu terlalu
nampak dia terlalu nice and terlalu expensive yang tempat ni memang basic tapi makanan dia okay juga
mm tak tahu kalau ramai ke tak mungkin kita kalau kita pergi
pagi-pagi kan then tak akan lah begitu
jadi kau tidur lah awal sikit
okay then kalau gitu kan I dah cakap
kita pergi botanical gardens makan breakfast so macam mana kita nak makan breakfast kalau nanti lambat lambat
okay boleh juga
kalau ramai tengok lah kalau boleh reserve ke apa nanti kita Google lah

I sudah tengok apa kebanyakan orang kan
okay kalau tengok in army in army
berbeza kalau compared to police dengan itu memang
macam for example pack

kalau nak belajar ya okay maybe bila kat uni kan uni kalau tinggal hall ke
okay boleh dengar
kalau tidak nanti it becomes distorted
okay okay then aku adjust
the boundary ah okay aku baru pasang
okay lah aku tak buat salah ah macam I I don't see
I wouldn't penalize myself uh just now ah maybe yesterday okay lah because yesterday aku macam kaku sikit because I didn't ride for very long right
to me I didn't want to say I experience I didn't want to lah but aku dah datang lambat semalam
semalam aku tak lambat so
then he started the face like macam
tahu macam oren penyet punya kan looking not happy like that so I was like okay lah I tell him I said okay I got experience like that uh uh kau experience kat mana aku cakap dulu I oh okay somebody go ask sampai back berapa then like uh
empat ke lima ah after second assessment
oh okay okay this one not for you go that one dia cakap macam tu
and obviously I I kept stalling like I um not midway but I kept stalling at that place yang you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or what I keep releasing too fast or something like that lah so dia macam when I'm moving then dia stall stall stall gitu
I don't see anything wrong with it lah macam they ask you to play from gear one to gear two right that's what I did
I think maybe it was probably twenty or twenty five or something like that aku bawa maybe thirty five ah thirty or thirty five ah it break dia punya speed ah
so the the problem was uh okay that that was yesterday so aku faham
I made less than less than ten rounds ah it was very fast I make less than ten rounds and then what happened was um dia cakap okay uh he put two people out
tak nak lah
fact ni cakap I didn't even stall today macam because I remembered doing this and I remembered I remembered riding like this the same way before and I pass
this time I failed he just said he just said you need more practice kepala otak dia lah need more practice at least you come and tell me macam maybe I did something wrong maybe aku terlalu laju or aku macam maybe I don't know maybe I didn't break before I change gear or something like that you know at least it's it's it's
I would learn from it and you know ini macam guessing game you know or not like oh I asked him I asked me just now I said oh actually what what went wrong like
wah tadi kau okay uh everything okay breaking okay tak macam semalam cause it it was the same fella ya the same instructor
oh takde apa-apa kau just need a a bit a bit a bit a of practice only just familiarise a bit more with the bike
no then inside my head I'm thinking kepala otak kau kau pun every prac kau pegang motor ke sama juga kan it's the same it's the same model what it's the same bike what what what is it that's so different
then I I I I got a bit irritated lah at that point of time then I just ah ya you know sudah lah
but tapi dia punya failure aku faham because I saw I saw what happened the first time she fell I didn't see the fall but she really tergolek you know rabak ah
because she okay you you try to visualise what where where I'm talking about ah okay basically when you ride on top they are four corners right she fell at the one you know where or not yang belakang yang that that wall
the sledge of wall no no E break is hujung sana ini yang dekat dengan admin punya side
time belok
dia turning ah ada cornering ah so
I was in front of her so aku bawa okay everything semua okay so I already made one round already
and then the instructor pun satu bodoh punya mangkuk she fell at the place where I really couldn't see
but I don't I also forgot about the mirror I didn't look at the mirror lah but I won't speeding I won't because that part memang you have to go down to get to that turn what
then aku belok sekali ada eh
because the other places where you turn ada orang it's quite open but that particular corner is is is ha memang seclude you cannot see anything there ah
ha then the instructor was like uh apa kau buat lagi alamak dia cakap macam tu kan then after that I I just I just don't I I don't get don't get don't get I just stop ah stop and wait
then she obviously her technique failed she gotta pick up the bike because because the bike was lying on the on the right and she was trying to pull to the left memang tak boleh lah of course cannot
so the instructor was like what what happened to you ah I told you how to do this and told you how to do that then why are you still making the same mistake again or whatever this and that ah so I guess takpe saya boleh tolong pasal dia jambu ke
and then ask her whether the she okay or not then she turned back and smile at she say eh sorry eh kalau in your way I say nevermind it's okay lah you just
just do your thing ah then the instructor go and tell her some more you know ha masa dah buang ni lagi
she likes to macam himpit to the left side
so no she probably got so close and after that she gabra because she was in the wrong lane after that so she skid and then she fall down but the funny thing was the bike was on my on the bike was on my lane
ha badan dia pula was on the other lane
but like I said that spot where she fell you cannot see from from before you literally need to reach that bend then you kau boleh kau boleh nampak dia
and then after that uh she was trying to start the bike ah kelakar cause when she fell kan I think the instructor went to kill switch so she didn't know
then she sat on the bike she tried to start but cannot start and then apa she said eh uh I think my motorbike spoiled dia cakap macam tu and then the instructor said your bike is not spoiled dia ingat spoiled dia try try try nothing and then she just got the clicking sound click clik clik one you cannot hear the engine starting ah
alamak how ni eh gini gini gini then he go there he said this one your switch your switch ha check your switch okay
then dia begin
takpe uh number one you go first I said but I thought you cannot overtake takpe takpe takpe I was number one she was number seven or nine I got number one ah so after that sampai habis
so I was just riding and riding and riding macam no problem lah to me literally like no problem I didn't even but there was one instructor was damn bloody annoying
because he the one yang pakai bandana I don't know you know or not to me he's damn bloody fucking annoying ah tall guy malay
muka dia macam mat sial sikit dia dia was on the he was on the he was at the bend yang depan lagi before you turn back into the the the admin area dia jatuh part sini kira square
macam ni kan admin area kat sini kan dia ada tempat sini si instructor lagi satu dia lepak sini the other side but when I was there and I wasn't speeding I wasn't because it
makes sense or not if you're not speeding or if you you already drop your speed kau nak brake buat apa you're already breaking already what I put on on on gear two and I I don't need to break and I don't need to clutch in nothing so I was just the bend and it wasn't
macam you can hear the engine sounds vroom it's just nice ah turn and like salah salah kau kena brake lagi kau kena brake lagi brake brake sebelum kau down gear brake kau nak brake apa lah siol so
at that point of time the more he talk the more aku peng ah but I guess no he wasn't he was he like he was the one with three tudung girls in his class
tapi dia orang baru nak keluar ah so
aku rasa dia nak malukan aku ke apa ah just want to start one again ya I guess normal leh you know whatever lah eh
for me lah as far as I'm concerned nothing went wrong dia suruh aku main one two one two one two three aku one two three one two four and back round to one okay no problem
ha plank plank quite senang what
but I still remember two B in seven seconds tak salah aku is fast lah let me class to you have to go thanks again eh
ya I saw I saw it uh tak salah aku nampak dekat mana eh
you don't upgrade now lah dol you you get your two A bike whatever super four ke three ten ke something like that okay you ride that bike for as long as you can and then once kau dah
confident once kau rasa macam you know your your your balls are big you dare to take a bigger bike ha that is five six years later you you change ah you don't have to macam oh I get class two sekarang juga aku nak tukar ha
but ya um then then then they are super fours in exactly the same look at the bike the body the lampu
four bottles mampus mampus
ya lah because you got to change it frequently apa
have what ah three ten is is pendek what
but you can lower the expansion you the zontes three ten can lower down the expansion yes but zontes three ten cantik sia
the yang one ninety
the the the the apa the capacity capacity I think is
dia punya tank eh dia punya tank is I think fifteen or sixteen litres
ya but the thing is a zontes kalau let's say misal kata if I were to use the bike in another country if I go to another country and if that bike mampus ke apa ke kat sana bro I'm dead sia
that's why you never go jauh-jauh I mean you went to malacca once right
ya lah you common bike boleh ah you you use all this kind of funny sounding bike even continental yang tak kira asia tak popular punya mampus kalau motor kau mati
oh kira macam gitu siala
habis ah
malaysia boleh
but imagine if you're like stuck in I don't know negeri sembilan ke apa
kena jaga ah
aiyo kena bully ah
but if you tolak means kena bawa perlahan ah very slow ah
sticky situation macam mana
no but kau boleh brake juga apa
dulu punya trend eagle apa ha
wobbly ah lepas tu jatuh ah
kira dia orang semua members ah
time tu your father belum kahwin ah
masih bujang lapuk ah
tapi it's just dangerous sia
oh ya ya ya I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard belum lagi after
speaking of of of of this part tadi um
there was this guy I don't know I got tell you or not tadi ada satu he was on the mini circuit ah
a'ah sia basically the bike is is basically the the the wall like this but he went up and then he was still he was still turning bro on the bike whack everything first kena the plastic barrier after that ah already dah ada bunyi like gitu broom gitu then after that
then he continue moving bro so the wall was here and then his bike was there the wall his his bike was rabak sial
aku tak tahu but after that he stop kaki dia sakit
here he cannot climb between after when he when he so called fell the bike was lying on him he bike was lying on him and he was sandwiched between the bike and the wall then dia macam I cannot ah I cannot
aku macam alamak
then the instructor the instructor just like eh nevermind you all continue continue macam tak apa-apa gitu nevermind nevermind you all continue and then he go he he came out lah to pull the bike one side then ask him you okay or not but I think after that he didn't didn't continue
I do not know but I I know dia cakap pasal after that's he walk he was limping
sakit juga siol sakit juga
but I really do not know no young ah maybe hazriq punya size ah
dia macam scooter sia

kimchi ramen ya you've always like something you know you always try you're always able to try something but for me I tak suka try new things I tak suka things that uh very foreign to me whatever I grow up with chicken uh chicken rice chicken and rice that's
you will eat ya you akan makan
itu itu important iya
itu important
kenapa dia berani sangat tanya soalan tu dekat someone
aku bukan apa yang kau cakap you know I'm not what you say I I am whoever I am
so if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would you do so as in manusia tak perlu kerja lagi
mesti lah soalan
okay jadi awak cakap awak
uh nak pergi travelling kan
tempat yang pertama sekali yang awak nak pergi the first place ever that you want to go
tak susah lah just think
why would you wanna skydive when you're scared of heights kenapa
saya bukan lelaki screw bullies
awak seorang jer pergi sebab
awak seorang jer menang ticket tu
satu ticket sahaja
awak pergi kenapa awak pergi tapi free tapi awak pergi seorang
ambil gambar ambil gambar hantar dekat whatsapp
kenapa suka romance I mean
or anything macam oh I can never forget this movie or you could have watched it like thousand of times but you're like let's watch it again
I think I like documentaries my favourite cause I like to know facts or like uh know what's going on it is seram but that's that's um
true kita ikut apa yang kita nampak
selama-lamanya satu makanan yang awak boleh pilih and makanan itu akan bersama awak sampai akhir hayat
saya ada dua choice
ya with daging kita boleh buat banyak kita boleh buat banyak uh lauk
macam have itself
okay lah awak pilih satu lepas tu kita share
kifarah like you get what you get
walaupun kita rasa kita buat banyak baik but mesti ada satu kejadian
yang awak tak akan lupa mungkin awak rasa macam oh saya tak saya nampak auntie ni
tengah crossing the road tapi saya tak tolong sebab
so awak rasa awak utamakan muka yang cantik
atau awak lebih suka cergas like you know kadang-kadang kita nak keluar kita
okay kita makeup kita get ready
tak boleh fit in our pants you know we wear shirts and we're like we have to cover up properly cause
badan sihat why any reason
you know I tak boleh masak and then when I balik kerja I macam um
ignore dia you know
biarkan dia buat kerja dia sendiri and I don't think having good looks would help with doing all those chores you know

he love new experience ah but like I think cause of the relationship dah makin lama macam just
and he's getting like to him he is getting older so untuk dia dah macam just ah malas ah
right I need to make him meet andre and then like brainwash him and another reason is because he used his and as a reason to like give up so aku macam ugh

wah fan service fan service habis
oh macam ni zan itu budak ini
yikes oh but he dia deliver like which area
oh dekat ah
his route oh okay tempat lepak literally
okay tahu tahu tahu
tahu tahu I know that one
ah tu lah
too and and and then they dia orang like buat videos yang can make you pause for a while and like oh I'll double tap that
entah aku tak tahu but we'll find out soon
so like um like you're not you know that that meme yang the person is like um like they're not happy they are annoyed
ya so that's what it means so if you see maknanya kiss kiss my teeth
like once you respond habis that's it mm
I do it you know I've got come my adik I do it at nasha when I ask her to like get me something
I am a minah at heart
it's six o'clock that's it I tutup my laptop I roll over to my bed and I buka tiktok
and she was like you tak nak makan eh and I was like oh right dinner I totally forgot
today I learn so macam like you know people can watch the videos very easily they can say oh that it's from this app called tiktok and at first it's like you know at first I I thought it was like the musically yang bodoh punya
ya betul betul betul
yes yes and we know that musically dengan vine tu semua budak kecil
yes like the budak mana from clementi tengah buat dancing
eh how long have you been going for the uh apa afro ah afro class
so for physical classes macam dia orang kasih berapa orang datang
stamina dah turun
rentak and all
I guess I guess that's the stereotype lah kalau macam malay dance instructor confirm zumba
you lose our pintu tak ada lah
then pakai lagu-lagu seventeen seventeen is known for their very sharp um dances
it's ayam juga
ah it's okay sis dah malam kan dah pukul sembilan fifty fifty
oh my god aku ingat kau dah ada dua phone ni I'm a businesswoman ke
how okay in the first place macam mana kau nak focus I I'm I just
you know what I mean ya to each it's own I trust you I know like if you say suara sedap mesti suara sedap kan
ha tu lah I thought that you know it should be exclusive if you're like into japanese stuff anime you probably won't go the other way
um it's more slice of life I guess um so I guess I prefer that kind rather than macam like actually the things I remember watching
who is basically a psychic then and he has like extraordinary superpowers so macam for him right he wears his like pink antennas on his head
so apparently that helps to curb his powers kalau dia tak pakai kan nanti dia bangun pagi kan terus dia punya rumah dah habis dah
so like he needs to so okay so his power is like literally anything that he touches expected to stone or like or if if someone say it's can you like urut me like he would urut and then after that you will just your body whole body just like just becomes a ball because he just his power is just too strong or he kicks someone okay so there's was this one scene
it's so merepek but it's so good it's so kelakar gila like if you have the time then give it like one episode I love it so much like during lunch breaks
okay yes yes I skip the intro that's what I do you have to skip the intro so like just one hour straight I'll just watch ah saiki it was so good and the thing is I think there's like a couple of seasons I rasa belum habis
like I've started two three weeks ago I rasa belum habis
I watch I watch during lunchtime I watch during dinner time tak habis-habis tau I'm like bila ni
aku tak tahu ada berapa season berapa banyak episode I'm still with season two tau season freaking two
oh yang total aku tak tahu aku belum I don't even know how many seasons there are sorry
ya it's like to it's she's own I guess I prefer that lah cause I guess I can relate to it more macam shonen is like a little bit more difficult for me cause you have to
even this one tak masuk akal pun at least I I can relate
I I actually um because I brought home najhah's punya um haikyu jacket and
yes she's she's tall tall is one thing she's also like quite berisi juga like she's not stick thin
plus it's like her favourite show so I tak nak hampakan lah
she's on freaking Reddit for like anime I was just like oh my goodness you really cannot like if you have any questions like you can you go ask me at least I can ask kak zan and kak najhah you jangan macam gini eh
some how are some people are just really ridiculous tau merepek gila tau dia punya perangai and then after awhile I realized that for
ha tu lah
she was telling me also like it's okay if you can't bring me I'll just find online I was like eh sixteen where you want to find online macam mana cannot because it's sixteen you cannot watch she's like I'll find the thirteen one
jesse mccartney no lah that's a singer merepek jer sampai jer kutuk aku bukan
tu lah uh tak boleh haram
ah biasa okay lah bagus lah apa apa lah shah
ah tu lah oh my god that is is so true like we were big kids already
like how they start with marriages like how they are very like you know the girls always like tunduk to the husband
you should just have said tiga so
kau datang dari drama mana ni
recently I watched because it came out on netflix I watched nur
it's so basically okay the is quite interesting okay so it's about this um new ustaz baru graduate from syria or something like worst of the countries
who has his own um tahfiz school and his own masjid
and then one day while he was giving the ceramah subuh thank god he he
kat masjid dia orang and then he received like some questions of people um and it's really weird because
ha dia orang Q&A tak pernah dengar kan
ada Q&A session uh the questions were
ya serious curious cat islamic version masjid version
bila keluar masjid then dia nampak this kelibat perempuan yang sedang menulis on a white piece of paper
he was macam ya like wow
so but like more in depth lah so like for him like want to provoking macam hati dia macam dup dup
uh kalau solat saya kentut bila rakaat ni
everywhere like dia punya dekat jalan and they met and they dated
ya because she didn't want to be found out so she tergesa-gesa but the she just
and she suddenly like not suddenly she seems like a very patient person but it's tak masuk akal the level of patients and the
my favourite like most ridiculous malay show that I watched was cinta si wedding planner
okay not twenty four seven but she was like full time when she's outside so there'll be like bedroom scenes okay not bedroom bedroom but she's chilling and then kat rumah and she's about to sleep and she's wearing tudung
or she's sleeping in her tudung
or like maybe not the not the you know the nenek-nenek kind
ha tu lah
coffee apa starbucks
cause kita dekat dengan bugis kan kita boleh pergi haji lane like haji lane okay for example yang macam kalau kau nak makan makanan melayu semua
macam zamzam ada ataupun err ah ramen stall dim sum place also that time I went ramen stall quite nice ah
sedap sia nak try ya it's apa tu okay lah
I feel like kita reserve reservation punya tempat jer ah through online aku buat
orh then kau last minute rush ah
yang tadi kau punya kawan semua ah okay
uh huh eh how come orh it's the presentation eh tadi but how come your works kena collected
mm ya correct correct correct ya you make the final uh apa tu big change ah
because like kau fikir banyak sangat then after that like at the end of the day you know macam this thing happen like you tak expect what
you know sometimes you expect it to be very bad right but then sometimes like you won't know pada kau because you see that artwork everyday the lecturers see it like oh dia macam it's their first time seeing it ah so they will either like it or not like it ah so if it if they like it means it's good lah
apa tu what they say about your works semua like during the presentation
no fine arts ah aku lain kan mm uh huh
mm orh maybe macam I feel like the concept doesn't really
entah eh
kau punya asal like okay kau lecturer berapa banyak dalam presentation room
fever and dengue dia rabak eh chronic eh but this lecturers are your class lecturers or adjunct oh okay so only one presentation ah bagus sia
aku dua presentation you know week fifteen week sixteen
week fifteen is our ya same module week fifteen is our lecturer itself macam tiga lecturer yang kita ada
and then like uh week sixteen is another lecture that we tak kenal ya so it's like uh brand new face that see macam because our lecturer ya correct correct
cause that lecturer kita kan everyday nampak kan so like they bring this another lecturer then from there terus but that particular presentation they see everything like what you did for the whole semester and your portfolio everything ya so it's like err that one I can say uh make or break ah
ya but the adjunct lecturers semua baik gila ya
pe processor ya entah lah that what name ya
cause last sem really it's rabak eh and I feel ya entah maybe because pasal like
entah eh I feel like last year was their year macam shu dengan like eden I feel like this year it's like me and effy punya ya their they are so rabak oi ah ya last term last term
mm honestly aku
mmhmm orh it's your own major right ya ya kita every sem tukar kelas ya but fuck
because like honestly I thought this sem kita akan tukar kelas lagi but then me and effy macam alamak kita geram gila ah
you know we still in the same class tapi macam okay how it goes right that
sama class so everyone in sama class ah so basically its like monday tuesday is kita punya satu module jer kita ada for this sem for next coming sem ah satu module jer but we have to choose another three modules that we want to take
kirakan major ah like what we want
macam we have macam performance installation we got ya ya we got a lot ah performing arts then we have
apa tu packaging motion design semua then we can only choose three aku ambil
okay what macam aku ambil figure drawing is the same what but it's still under fine arts what
ya graphic comm ya because graphic comm we have a lot of apa tu routes to go actually so this one I took we have to choose three then uh from that three then kita belajar then ya
ya but honestly it sucks because last sem aku tak dapat ambil dua yang figure drawing full kan
ya so aku just have to cause my I only have to take two for my module ya huh oh my god aku four jer eh mmhmm
oh ya ya but packaging ah the aku dengan effy took the same thing we took packaging motion illustration and the other one I forget what oh design and brand strategy because honestly uh kalau kita ada tiga ni benda kan then intern kita will be easier though ya because like for us macam apa eh
ya and honestly aku tak sabar untuk intern I don't know why
cause like I feel like kita boleh pilih but at the same time macam our lecturer will be the one that ya but uh honestly after that after this coming semester kan kita ada three months holiday right then me and effy thought of like kerja at any uh graphic comm punya firm and then from there kalau like we feel that in in apa tu that company is quite good then we just continue until intern lah
dah ada kerja what you mean okay uh huh
kerja for that really meh no lah I don't think so tu ni diploma
the process then kau will first day macam for example first day kau is during that year three sem one ya I feel like it's like that ya lah so apa yang kau nak start dalam year two sem two ya lah the process is year two sem two lah ya lah okay so that's what I should've say girl
hmm entah eh I feel like it's a both pros and cons because
for your own self and like ya you have your own voice and you can macam
then after that like uh tak the cons is like you have to compete with everybody ah
and a bit like macam
in your face tau macam company tu tak nak kau macam ouch sakit sia honestly right yesterday I saw like a lot of jobs right they dekat apa tu indeed aku nampak banyak macam art teacher abeh those apa eh
that C word I forget what is that for the ni lah budak-budak art
bukan taxi lah aduh
I mean like your course quite broad lah honestly and yesterday also aku cari macam kedai-kedai eh kedai eh company you know there's a lot of art galleries looking for people to kerja as part time eh stop it
ya so stop hais eh kau nak kerja dengan aku ke tak yang picking packer okay lah this whole week kau take a break then maybe kita start kerja next week ah
kalau bukan this week kau nak confirm dengan aku bila okay okay okay
hais no cause aku start kerja kan
so it's like no honestly if they were to put me in a retail punya position I can find other retail stores to work you know it's a stall but macam kirakan there's a lot of macam promoter at each section so you are doing that kau kat situ macam kau kena jaga overall then kau kena tengok-tengok and at the same time you have to like go for the customer ni semua lah
point you know oh my god I just censored my own ya and then like I never even get that position so aku it's a retail position or cashiering I don't know I mean it's not even promoter it's just that whole retail store kau kena take care of ya so exactly that's why aku terus like
aku dah tak aku dah quit I told shah about it and then I was super depressed you know what I did they don't even know what I'm supposed to do at that yesterday you know they just gave me the job and like oh you can just go to the customer then I'm like oh okay then after that they never tell me any other instructions
I think six hours nine eleven to six eh I just whatsapp the manager ah say like the environment is not for me uh what uh this is honestly not what I expected it lah macam this is not the position I he haven't reply but I left the group already ya kalau tak esok aku kerja esok thursday aku actually dah full this this week
tu aku nak tanya kau nak kerja picking packer ke tak no no no the packer
because just now tak ini packer packer kat dia bilang kau pack apa
toy R us actually okay eh quite good eh aku nak ni green party apa kedai dia okay dok kau tahu kan the kedai jual apa no the green party
you don't know that store dia macam miniso eh
it's okay though that kedai
what if kau kena tengok shift dia juga shift dia dengan
shift dia dengan dia punya working hours
jauh oi okay true
I don't know kalau kau nak aku boleh
kalau kau nak aku okay I don't know ah I feel like
but semalam aku ada bilang kau kan yang apa tu
yang aku screenshot lah kerja tu
mana eh
ada safe distancing ambassador eh kat sentosa eight dollar per hour jer kot
kau just uh they they what they say is that
bodoh lah kau
kau kan
entah lah everything's okay though I can say belum ah baru submission oi
tak kita tak ada kita dah tak ada ah
okay I understand I don't know ah I feel like those abeh macam general studies and all right I I don't understand macam nanti like apa kita buat then like what we dapat is like the hell
mm entah eh
eh legit ah makan ramen stall aku nak try ni ah ball
tu apa bukan tu boat noodle ramen stall is the japanese punya ni sebelah dim sum punya ni kat haji lane
macam aku nak tunjuk aku tengah record
a'ah eh betul juga eh
but then I don't want to spend so much today eh aku dah tak ada duit I spent but tipo honestly is berapa eh berapa dollar ah
allowance for this month and then kalau aku tak kerja aku tak ada duit kalau dah habis
oh my god don't say aku punya printing jer one time printing fifty five dollar eh I have to print my uh board I have to print my
apa tu photo book
ya because our now is like macam
apa tu macam buku ah kirakan
I got tell you right that my lecturer showed everyone my and ya they uh then end up orang lain punya kerja yang dia pilih aku dah exactly so I'm like exactly then uh effy is quite mad ya
effy dia sot lah tak aku example it's like really unfair ah I don't know why but it's just the school lah I can say
you show macam orang punya kerja it's like a good thing lah but at the same time it's a very bad thing cause everyone's going to follow you and end up everyone's gonna like
apa tu copy yours and do better and after that
and you are still kat bawah trying to survive padahal kau punya it's like orang yang copy
eh kau suka pergi hiking tak
tak aku macam nak pergi hiking
aku dah lama mana tak pergi hiking abeh one time aku kat abeh macam mana
entah lah
not every ah ya can say ya macam friday I fetch him and saturday the whole day expo ah so every time dia nak patah balik patah balik sunday ya
aku tak bilang siapa-siapa ya it's like I don't know ah at times we gaduh and then like but that one time we gaduh right quite rabak ya but uh the thing about us is like even if we fight so much right we won't break it off
ya because we find it macam you know if we break it off then what's the point of us macam wasting each other's time at the first place right then like ya correct correct mm the thing I like about him right dia punya mindset is really mature oi he's your age ya
then like I don't know ah dia macam dia cakap like kalau you dah tak suka I semua ke apa in our relationship anytime tau kalau aku just dah tak ada feelings but just bilang dia and tell him the reason why then if it's like makes sense to him then he'll like let me go lah kalau tak macam if he wants to make it work lah ya so it's like very matured thing ah at the same time kalau kita nak break it off
we have to really macam talk things out to each other and yup I don't see that coming any mean time ya
ya really a lot until we I think he um apa eh I call kan dia tak angkat
at that point macam betul-betul like he like we had enough of each other lah
but then macam um during the period the first few weeks terus macam makin lama makin okay then now it's better ah
ya cause that time he was on holiday then I was like quite free right dengan my school schedule then like we met almost everyday sia then I feel like it's because like we are too ya too attached to each other that
and like pejam celik pejam celik aku next month dah one year dengan dia dok
ya you remember that time where we sat at eighteen chefs and then I told you that I like this guy ya tu masih suka eh aku masih uh kerja kat seh baru baru oh my gosh then now dah nak one year it's quite fast eh really really fast
aku kawan kau pun dah nak masuk apa two years two years right going to what after this after december two years already sia friendship quite fast eh last year was our year one
dua tiga kali abeh kau tak nampak dia langsung ya kau lagi jangan cakap but the during that macam year year one sem two aku nampak dia quite lah
entah eh aku pun tak rapat dengan si dia dengan dia sangat aku rasa like kita year one pun I feel like you are more close to him
I feel like because you guys are in the same course what ya and then like from there aku terus dah tak ni apa
seri pun wah that time I talk to seri kat cause I say I miss her then after that wah I quite proud eh have you seen her instagram
her own collection she even photograph and videograph all herself ya cause with I told her it's like girl you're gonna do great you got a bright future ya I think she in indonesia I ask her asal she drop out ni semua I don't know whether she I honestly I forget dah lama gila that one I asked her during year one
uh kalau tak salah dia drop out ataupun dia stop for a while then continue

aku year two kan legit oi macam no effort
time aku pakai makeup pun pergi luar jer mm ya aku pun dah malas
then like entah eh

entah ah exactly that's that's the thing
ya ya because I feel like it's very macam entah eh you feel like shit mm makeup everything ya I agree I agree because like you don't you don't want to be the
macam the sad looking person amongst all the pretty girls ah penat ah kadang-kadang
aku dengan kawan aku yang perempuan perempuan pun semua pakai makeup lawa-lawa then aku macam alamak then nanti you stress on your own oh shit what am I supposed to wear oh my god what am I supposed to actually same
but usually at some point aku dah malas gila aku pakai aku punya baseball jersey dengan aku punya jeans dah abeh orang pakai kasut kan semua lawa-lawa aku pakai slipper oi
legit eh dah malas ah mm
then eh busy punya
ya sometimes no heck care lah ya that time pun birthday party kawan aku wah I find it wah really pointless it was last week uh after I send shah then uh dress code K me being a person where I wear black and white everyday cause I'm a very monochrome person right
my friend err the dress code is warm tones alamak ya lah but then all the tu apa yang skirt tu aku dah tak boleh muat oi tu year one aku kecil sia aku sekarang dah gemuk oi legit I walk away a lot when I was with shah cause we eat a lot ya then after that aku macam alamak
I wore white t-shirt eh white uh long sleeve dengan yang skirt tu apa tu yang shawl hitam ya so it was okay
then terus aku macam alamak nak pakai apa eh tengok aku punya closet tinggal satu baju white apa warm tones kan warna brown tapi it's not really brown it's brownish yellow abeh semua stripes stripes ada warna putih then aku macam alamak pakai jer lah and then I
err for me it's like err macam very
masai ah
not aunty lah but masai ah macam entah ah selekeh ah then after that aku jumpa kawan-kawan aku semua tak ikut dress code lepas tu dia orang cakap dia orang tak ada then aku macam abeh semua pakai baju top warna putih abeh seluar hitam then aku macam bro I could've just wore that seh abeh kawan aku yang perempuan lagi pakai hitam
aku dah macam girl at the birthday party right is only the family yang pakai warm tones then aku just macam I'm like what so ya orh it's actually merepek ah oh tu pun aku dah tak boleh muat eh skirt tu ya I want to I don't know where that skirt go already or ya kita pergi museum pe cause that time ada yang mm neon light that one kind ya sekarang dah boring ah neon light
you know I don't uh she told me that she don't like but I feel that she like him dah lama cause girl
ya and then dia cakap aku ada bilang kau kan yang dia orang pergi club together and all oh my god
then aku cakap kau kalau seri bilang kau kau act macam tak tahu jer eh aku cakap gitu
ya honestly my class sekarang is not really actually bonded every class aku pergi is not bonded
it's all clique by clique by clique which I find it macam a bit irritating ah
ya so aku sekarang stick dengan effy jer walaupun the other girls kan dia orang satu clique err like ada chinese girls dengan chinese girls and then kita ada lagi satu girls macam macam indonesian dengan singaporean macam campur but dia orang semua baik ah aku punya orang is
even though I have three err I'm always like with that one friend I will always be neutral to everybody ya so macam mana-mana aku pergi nanti dia orang macam eh nelly nelly so aku macam okay ah then like um that that one group of girls semua okay lah dia orang okay dengan aku so aku okay ah
melayu indonesia cina ya campur-campur ah
cause kadang-kadang aku tak ada benda nak buat buat pun aku pergi kat dia orang macam hey how's your work
ya group work pun kadang-kadang aku just campur dia orang
err nadhirah eh uh huh khine ya dia suka
tahu pasal huh how they know
no girl it's very hard for him to like somebody and the way the girls that he like is all mostly chinese or korean or japanese dia punya pasal lah eh macam girls like angel yes ya you know malays is super hard ah kalau nak kawan dengan dia kawan rapat macam kita boleh I feel like a lot of girls jealous bila kita rapat dengan him because kita jumpa khine kita selalu macam peluk abeh rapat-rapat pe but he's like for me it's like I don't know eh
ya and I put the line already eh you know and I find him more like girl friend instead of a boy friend macam hey khine mm okay
nanti kadang-kadang macam hey girl then aku macam aku terus khine then after that ah that time aku masih in my in my clique ah aku nampak dia kat err apa campus one lobby abeh lepas tu dia macam hey girl then wear tudung tau
then semua orang tengok aku tau then terus kita lari kita peluk each other dia macam macam you know those like love movies like something then we just we just have each other ah then everyone look at us you know macam semua tak expect ah like um macam dia kan handsome nak mampus so everyone confirm macam err confirm everyone macam oh I want to be the one that is hugging I don't know lah kadang-kadang I find it macam a bit merepek ah
hmm entah aku tak tahu nak berbual dengan siapa aku macam okay let's just berbual dengan budak-budak pakai tudung mana tahu dia orang baik ah aku macam gitu but then once I heard kau hello I'm anna I'm twenty one from girl be my friend
because everyone is very young eh at that point then I'm like huh ya that's why it's like entah ah but the the reason why I was close with shaz first because I was the only one that talk to her during that general ya class
cause that time aku cakap dengan shafiq err aku just nak cari classmate aku ah macam kawan daripada class aku kan at least ah aku boleh pergi kelas dengan dia aku tak seorang ya so that's my ya because she sit in front of me tak aku just try out jer then aku just hi uh like what class you from oh I from uh one that time kita punya class apa one G eh honestly tak ingat apa dia cakap one G
oh girl same class then kita just all the way together ah plus from there aku tanya dia like
uh why you not rapat with the other girl semua like our class semua okay aku cakap gitu ah macam all about the worried about the class thingy
okay so I she's going away we're going to get her a present ah and ya I think you're right the frames are too heavy we're not going to give those but how I don't want it to be like macam buku yang just print out like that biarkan gitu then it's just gonna sit in a cupboard forever I feel like it will be cool if it was something that she
can see everyday you know especially in that country maybe lots of pictures of us in the sunshine macam while she freezing her butt off there
yes yes yes yes ya ya ya so it's not just err err apa tu what we going to make
err phone phone case it can be anything it can be a mug it can be a t-shirt boleh apa-apa kan
but no you want a gift that can on that day itself be looked at right okay okay fine ya ya then I think ya we can find some small light items nak buat dia punya print ah so we're gotta select a bunch of pictures of what we like right and then
figure out what are the things I'm sure they have online presence mesti ada kalau kau pergi dia punya website dia cakap that these are the things you can bring on or something ah or if not actually there are a lot of websites that do that so macam vista print
cause they are that kind of digital printers so they do everything so okay so let's pick out a bunch of pictures kita pilih mana yang kita suka then that becomes the photo book and then we pick out a few others ya okay can ah I guess that is the plan
aku tak ada tak ada bilik tau bilik aku is my sister you know so cause I was living elsewhere so my things were always a minimum ah and then both times when I go government staycation also
again I lost a lot of things so my whole life has been a series of losing shit lah moving and macam just all over the place so when it meant that when I moved into this house I just didn't have
why can't it not be us apa jer okay so how about we make a poster ah of us
when forever in your heart you know sort of vibes ah ya ya it's ultimate narcissism for a group that is so in love with ourselves gitu
what is the deal dia secretive gila ah sia aku tak tahu dia sekarang at which point you know are their tickets booked is that is what is happening over there you know
sharing about it like that time I I thought her her attitude was interesting like she was dia cakap that um
she don't want to talk about it to people cause she's afraid to like jinx it gitu and then she would also feel very embarrassed if she was supposed to leave on a certain date and then didn't then people will like macam
eh nisa why you never leave eh kau apa sia I'm like can't imagine who the who the hell would actually do that to her
tak aku rasa it is that ya ya ya when it comes to him you're right they got some secretive things aku aku rasa that dia cakap dengan nisa that these things kau tak payah share dengan kau punya friends I think so too I think that is that sort of understanding between them which
ya lah it's their partners lah we should respect that ah but I just thought there was some fear there you know of people mocking her and I'm like um you a bit too old to have this fear tapi dia kadang-kadang got got that kind of little streaks of like
how to be her own person ah like she will stand up to people and she will I liked it when I see her at parties and she very mother hen with all the younger ones I think it allows her to make a lot of friends cause she goes in like a kakak kakak you know she goes in like
ah kau dah okay tak and then aku boleh cakap dengan kau gini gini gitu gitu like like she's just how are you macam mana sekarang sekolah gitu gini you know and ya
ya I I don't understand what it could take macam ah ya unless somebody changes drastically and that could happened sometimes somebody becomes bitter or alcoholic you get what I mean ah then you become a bit wonky ah
ya both both both to tini okay got it okay so she felt like somehow you macam take tini
together apa kau orang semua sama-sama tu ah
so abeh at that point kau tak cakap apa-apa dengan dia
abeh kau tak terasa nak cakap apa-apa dengan dia cause kau dah tahu kan ah
ah dengan tini
siapa jas dengan tini asal eh dia orang macam
so hari tu bila kita dah sampai dekat pizza cause again I'm lost in my own world did they have a chat outside dia orang berbual
ya ya ya ya ya ya unless you're coming to eat with us then okay lah it's clear tapi kau
iya lah like like like you like to
ya okay okay okay ya ya ya nobody really likes that anyway ya ya ya yup ya ya ya I understand tahu
jadi kau bila kau berbual dengan sarah kau adalah explain dengan dia that the reason why that even came up in the first place was pasal kau nak understand make tini understand that she's being played ah
did did we post that picture in the group chat with dengan dia punya cake nama dia tu ah K K
tahu tahu tahu ya ya ya ya kau percayalah ya I know I know I know I know I know I know ya
ah correct correct it's new information for someone you know as opposed to macam mengeluh over somebody usual pattern tu lain
ya tak tahu seh cerita cerita ni semuanya
ya tu lah tu lah
then I also wonder oh is it because we just don't say these things kita mana nak belajar pasal boundary and learn how to do it
ah ah correct aku rasa macam
tu lah tu lah kami datang nak petik bunga di taman awak
ya it's the bahasa berbunga and the gentleness of the language overall lah ya ya ya makes it hard
I bet you would have kau mesti ketawa macam perempuan gila in the corner and make it a lot worse than it is nanti dia fikir aku betul-betul suan dia
confirm tau kau punya sense of humour kadang-kadang like no janganlah
ah so azmi tahu ah hari ini kau datang sini buat ni ah kau cakap dengan dia
kita tengah we are currently in about let me see twenty seven minutes we are about halfway through ah azmi can you entertain yourself
ya I did say no background noise but that was just a really quick one kami minta maaf iya
ah or maybe I do I don't know I have to go in and check that might be some ground ginger from my mum she likes this she gives me ground ginger so I could mix it with some hot water and and something okay I'll go look at it after this actually I'm getting damn hungry so after this I do aku nak pergi makan
aku nak makan mak aku punya briyani tak kisah pergi mampus dengan perut aku and come and taste some a bit sedap makan dia dengan curry all these
mak aku masak two days ago national day feasts
ah tu ah tu pun ada I didn't even know we had this tradition tapi tak pasal-pasal ah hari ni national day kita ada briyani abeh aku is not not having it so that day I was out at brunch then after brunch went over to to aman friends place right so I was
ya do you know there was my national day was so non eventful on my way to brunch which I had with a friend dekat at kat upper thomson aku pass by dekat road aku nampak banyak-banyak orang semua diri dekat luar road
then aku thought they were going somewhere but no cause it's this mobile columns that's moving right so that's why I did not know about this mobile columns at all so I was like why are they just standing there kalau kau nak pergi somewhere jalan ah asal diri sana panas terik tu hari tu aku dengar forty one degrees
apa ni you're supposed to kill people that's what the war machine is for right but ah no but apart from that I had no idea it was national day I didn't even hear fireworks can you see from here
jadi sekarang macam mana kau nak try tackle one of the questions
folklore and petua-petua kesihatan you get what I mean for like different ah different food items whether it's different types of herbs different types of leaves different types of yams whatever from indonesia
the waiter comes out and the presentation is beautiful the way he like opens up the kau tahu macam bunga-bunga apa tu eh bunga ulam eh or is it the bunga-bunga macam
look like banana flower kind of vibe ah or top ginger you know that kind where you sort of peel it open kan ah lepas tu the way yang dia orang serve and like plate the thing and then telling the explanation of what it's for and how do people use it are there any stories associated with it I thought that was a really memorable meal cause everything that you taste suddenly had a lot of significance and I'm sure we all had meals like that and I think whenever somebody plans meal kan
ah tu
bila larut malam punya vibes ah
ya ya ya actually I don't even know about I feel like I've got aku pernah dengar nama dia saffron tapi aku tak tahu kat mana dia kat bugis
where is it tampines ah okay okay okay ya lah maybe that's why aku tak travel out lah
it's very random and it goes straight to tampines I don't even know why normally the road ni kira ada feeder bus jer biasanya tapi sekarang ada one two seven apa benda
and I've been seeing a lot more of this large bright green buses punya bus baru punya ah ah dia orang macam tak tahu ni bus baru ke service baru but
ah new buses lah right that they bought ya ya ya ya so from tadi yang aku faham bus ni kalau kalau kalau kau ambil bus ni dia terus pergi highway
do not pass do not collect two hundred dollars dia terus pergi highway lepas tu kau end up in tampines in berapa minute okay lah not minute lah but iya lah you get the idea ya ya very short ah
but they take awhile they all take awhile they will go and explore kat mana kita pergi tengok-tengok err geylang mari lah kita boleh tengok katong
mm katong ya there's a lot of ah detours ah tak faham seh
ah ask bird park pun bird park aku sakit hati aku ambil bus pergi sana one and half hour sia
pantat kering ah that I basically aku need to sampai boon lay
ah bird park kau kau cakap apa zoo eh
dia orang masih tak email aku sia after aku hantar resume aku about that was I think on the seventh
dia dia cakap they didn't basically dia macam portal gitu kau upload upload resume apa benda then at the end it just had a your resume has been successfully submitted ah ah kau tunggu three weeks
then the meantime there are other things like my I have a friend who call me and it's basically what this is is a startup habis startup ni dia macam kumpul together all the plumbers electricians sort of thing okay then you would it works like a uber where you would find a service and book it and then abeh kau kau boleh tengok dia punya err err route to you ah macam macam macam grab delivery ah boleh nampak dia punya driver on the way to you how long more it will take blah blah blah
and then ah they need somebody to help coordinate this things in the back end and also err check out on the services that is provided tanya lah dengan orang tu okay okay tak dia orang buat ada apa-apa rosak ada apa-apa okay complain ke apa benda um
so that's that the job seems rather interesting tapi I'm I'm a little concerned about it on a couple of levels ah firstly dia startup abeh baru start apa apa cerita dia sebenarnya you know like what is the process and is it kau orang ada macam any or template in place or actually kau orang tengah cari orang untuk start the whole thing up you know from scratch properly cause if that's the case ya okay I I also don't have problem with that but I would need to make sure that I'm paid
there are already a lot of websites where you can even like directories and you can kau boleh filter down tau kau tinggal kat mana orang ni kat mana ah that kind of thing it's not something new ah this
pulling together of different house jobs you know plumbing ah carpentry little bit that sort of thing it really exists a lot jadi aku macam err apa seh
nak try ke tak
abeh in the meantime ada benda macam gini okay aku happy nak buat I don't know why sia I don't know ah I'm feeling macam don't want to work and then also the fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic and there's all this weirdness and more jobs to be lost and the economy is going to shit
it's not a way of avoiding the world it's just aku don't feel like dealing with you all right now it's too much crap I don't feel like it I'm not having it
leave ah I learn this new word vibing I'm just vibing man so kira macam tangkap jer ah vibing so I vibe ah
ah ah ah betul
betul betul betul and just live a simple basic life for awhile right ya
ya ya I would get into something quite obsessively I think you know like just explore or pursue or an interest sampai
ya ya ya the whole thing is a very romance novel vibe yes ya with the hair and the jawline it's very like the guys that you find on the cover of romance novel gitu ah
tu ah abeh macam kau terasa ah kau terasa macam kau nak extra mentel gitu tak tahu dari mana punya ni ah
that's also a romance novel apa macam the rope who you tame taming the rope
pangkeng means apa eh
oh tu tu yang kau orang panggil hotel ah rumah uncle
tak tahu seh
kau kau bayangkan hidup mesti ada concept
kau bayangkan ada cakap dengan kau hidup mesti ada concept computer programme
eh kau
kira macam gang ah ah ah ah ah
alah geramnya it's like asking your parents kita sebenarnya asal dari kampung mana seh
mm mm mm mm mm budak marsiling
okay kau boleh nampak malaysia tapi sana tak ada causeway tak ada apa kan there's no bridge
toa payoh aku rasa mungkin ada port
alah sedih
aku macam >pakai file tak pakai file pun dia orang tak kisah seh
ah ah betul
I I went to this activist event ah some time ago two years ago I think it's called apa itu activist so it was mainly organized by AWARE and a lot of other like MARUAH all this ah different activists and groups here in singapore then one of it had breakup session so then you can pick
which room you want to go to participate in which session ah so I went to this one particular room where dia orang macam mana tau macam lebih kurang tiga puluh orang tiga puluh orang sit in a circle berdiri in a circle
and then berdiri in a circle lepas tu the person yang moderator diri dekat tengah dia cakap okay if you have these things that I'm about to say you step back
if you don't if you never had these things then you step forward so they started asking ah kau ada maid tak kau pernah ada maid rumah kau abeh kalau kau ada kau step back
so abeh ask more questions ah macam kau pernah ada rumah family kau ada kereta tak kau orang pernah pergi holiday kau pernah rasa macam snow basically questions about privilege ah then at the end of the thirty forty questions that he asked
kau boleh nampak ah siapa yang kat tengah siapa yang kat belakang sikit abeh yang kat tengah banyak was a lot of brown people also cause some of the questions that was asked was also macam have have anybody made fun of your name
abeh aku found myself right in the middle with two other people
I was a bit confused about being in the middle cause I thought I ada pretty good life you know ya we got no maid no car all these tapi there's always food on the table I had uniforms I've heard so many other stories of people who had it so much worse right that was interesting but then
dia semua pun ada abeh kenapa orang lain tak boleh ada ni semua kenapa hidup dia orang nak kena sampai macam gini seh
couldn't he just kept crying and crying the group macam went around him abeh sayang sayang dia and
betul betul betul aku ada terfikir tau at that moment macam eh kau yang nangis sepatutnya aku yang patut nangis apa sia kau nangis tapi aku rasa tapi aku rasa kadang-kadang
tu ah ya ya correct correct there was a sense of that there's definitely a sense of that but then there was also a sense of maybe you need to
like be far removed from the from the situation in order to sympathize with it sometimes when you are too close in the situation dia macam apa tak kisah ah buat jer ah
tapi when you are far away you realised actually this person doesn't need to do this you know this person should be able to have other options instead of being forced to towards doing X Y Z so maybe he was in the better position to to understand privilege than we do cause he's
I don't know I don't know what it is ah about us like you said maybe it's that change over from technology that's change and suddenly from a position of being macam a bit suaku about the world suddenly we see a lot more we see a lot more riches we also see a lot more pain and poverty
eh aku tak suka ah dia orang punya cerita tak habis-habis tak habis-habis pasal aku dulu ah very very poor tau aku tak ada duit family aku tak ada duit
main soccer
macam are you listening to yourself not bro
ah kau tak ada script ke ni sikit-sikit ah
ya ya ya ya ya ya and who's writing this maybe the people writing it are tone deaf in the first place you understand like aku can imagine them choosing some like rich fuck
oh this is the whampoa ya but cause kau orang punya the other side siapa lim tian
lim tian sama dengan randolf ah
randolf was volunteering with lim tian apa
it's for people who are scared lah it does need they need to be told that cause even this election banyak kali sia macam naomi had colleagues my mother had friends who all said your vote is not secret in singapore
this fear is still there ah and aku rasa the the the likes this fear to be there cause then senang apa untuk dia orang
ah kau try ah nanti aku tak kasih kau covered walkways kau nak covered walkways
but now I see my apa I was specially recognised as a top fan
it's a facebook group ya ya ya I was so proud of myself aku macam I took a screenshot and send to naomi and say my accomplishment for today everybody we must achieve something
hidup mesti ada concept
okay I'm actually very stress lah pasal the my wedding lah
that was the initial plan err tapi entah the situation can change you kno
err kalau we we I moved to his house kan at least nak pindah to our new house it's lagi dekat lah I mean you have to you know shuffle between west and east to to move the barang</malay
mm then don't know lah to him like if let's say I move to your house as into your parents' house eh and then like rohana because kesian kan the the the budak macam</malay
tak kan nak share satu bilik perempuan lelaki unless they are willing to build err bunk bed lah which actually they are not sharing a bunk bed err we have seen he's not sharing a bunk bed with the brother is two separate bed cuma share bilik saja</malay
so I thinking kalau if we move to my parents house the
at least I am staying as in sleeping on my own you know at least ada bilik and the house is bigger then dia pun dia pun cakap like oh ya ya I agree also but then the a bit the cons is that it's all the way to the wes
ah itu dia macam takut not really takut lah like you know too dah biasa tinggal kat east and then you have to come back all the way to the west afterwork y
ya it was to be a combined wedding tapi due to budget lah kan um
maybe consider to do two separate size lah so cuma no doubt it will be cheaper but then it will be leceh you know because we have to tak kan I went to do both side at one place so like as in maybe one place to be different are
aiya ya just basically just a bit susah lah
yes but then tak semestinya we have to move in straight away after we get the keys right I mean it definitely there will be something to consider macam like like what mother cakap is to do renovation for the kitchen you know have to put in cabinets and everythin
oh that one I didn't check err because the only thing that I check was that if let's say um we get married later if let's say I get married in early twenty twenty three and will they still give us like time to turn in the marriage certificate ke tak</malay
ah because err I know there are the the protocol is I think if I'm not wrong lah six months atau three or six months to submit the certificate either before your house already or after that was like dulu lah s
entah but they did say if he cannot commit to that timeline then you can appeal but no guarante
yes yes but then um one thing about the the is florida kasi ready ready like err provide the flooring err basically the basic stuff is already there just that of course kitchen is bare lah
err tapi I mean because we were so focused on the flat itself we didn't think about before that you know because when we apply ah it was actually just for fu
it was just for fun so err tak sangka that we get an appointment and then w
move forward then after that that's where we started to plan oh uh wedding macam mana err how to plan and everything because is like I told you righ
his family is very big bigger than ours so all the saudara mara dah besar besar how about lik
the budak the kids confirm like you you send one invitation is not two people come is satu famil
ah okay okay but then like going back to the wedding part eh for twenty thousand for one thousand person do you think is double ke tak</malay
I mean with now at this time it was is now twenty twenty to have two years to plan technically we have to already set aside some money because by next year dah kena deposit you know o
ah okay but then I mean ya lah whatever you face last time was it's good to know I mean who knows sekarang pun is about the same tapi we do have like thoughts abou
memang okay memang we did consider to do separate which of course yes it may cost less than just do combine but to think of it right i
kita buat kat bawah block ya let's say for my side ah
I kita buat kat bawah block you have to consider that oh catering and decoration may not be under one err one company we may be separate and then err apa ni like you have to thin
that okay location you have to be one thing one err price and then your deco one price okay catering one price and then like macam you know that the the fundamentals like you say like compoun
mak andam all this separate lik
for me I think like oh because kita buat combine and it is a location that can provide a lot macam for the one at orchard righ
and if you want kompang then that one is different thing lah then the only thing that I have to worry about is um the ride
uh the bridal and photography but if let's say we took that away because kalau boleh I want t
satisfies satisfy my parents so you know lah my dad punya thinking i
you know that budget right make it a small nikah and then just makan makan lah after that which actually my mum say oka
but then you know lah my father got problem so and lagi pun</malay
good wedding ah is really really great lah so macam entah jus
okay ah if let's say we don't do combine we do separately will be it will not be fair to him lah because he will definitely have to fork out more first on top of the duit hantaran and everything like his family is very big right so you have to cater more peopl
and then also we have to consider vehicle costs err to ferry to each other to each side lah so at least kalau macam at one locatio
of the after that you want to change outfit just go up or this area have like a fitting room whereas for like kalau buat two separate locations if let's say you want to change one outfit at thi
site then change another outfit at another sit kan susah and then kesian the mak andam kadang kadang I'm not thinking for myself lah I am thinking for other people so y
that's why lah is really really hard for me to think about this lagi lagi two years is actually very fast confirm very fast I don't know how to move from there lah from now lah
I mean I get it lah you told me to work on it tapi the problem is I have been discussing like
parents lah all about these tapi I don't know whether he did discuss with his side because lik
kita banyak discuss within each other its tapi entah lah when I told him to go and discuss with his parents then macam</malay
okay okay boleh okay but then like no news you know after that so it's always m
either me contacting her mum uh his mum atau she contact me to get update because he don't tell her anything so how to work on tha
at least alah dah biasa makeup sendiri is best to you know biar orang kat orang makeup kan orang kan lagi pun</malay
ya the mak andam dia punya at least they have experience you know in doing wedding make up and then also cannot take it already lah eh the cost also is a lot but then to me should not eve
I'm not say concern but just tutup one eye lah for the because like it's for a big day you see so you shouldn't worry about that and lagi pun</malay
uh tapi kahwin sekarang
itu pun okay no doubt her big plans changed ah but at least they get to save money you know like whatever deposit right it's whatever the um th
planner is helping lah so like for example their they will supposedly do the combined wedding then it will suppose to make bawah block lah
but because now really very hard right so the err dia parents cakap okay never mind I'll help you find one location they actually recommended hotels lah
so her concern is that eh bento box mana cukup like is a malay wedding tau you will tend to eat more tha
usually you do but so you is you limit to one person one bento macam is not fair but they still paying the same price as the normal buffet so she was very worried about that lah but then because of this eh err she had actually got enough as i
ya of course lah you too just want the nikah but the
knowing that we're number one in the family so can I live up to certain expectation you see ah lagi alah I think because the his mother also macam</malay
alah mak pak dia dah tua so he she's been trying to push him to get married lah so I don't know whether that means that oh just cepat cepat kahwin then dah or just want to make it a big even
because lah ya lah like you mention that I'm still considered an uh outside outsider kan so I mean kalau boleh I don't want to masuk campur lah whatever happens because it's not my family ye
tapi kalau orang tu tak nak bual bual dengan mak pak dia nak buat macam mana I mean kalau boleh I tak nak masuk campur bu
if she keeps coming back to me I have to like whatever out of respect what ah sebab ini pun ya at this time pun is good lah to get married cuma</malay
definitely lah now you kan confirm ada yang macam kenapa tak jemput and everything and then they don'
understand that you know it's it's not by choice I mean tak yah by choice lah but then there's a limit to the choice s
if if kata that err you want to invite a certain family member tapi sangat jauh actually like four hours is like already long lah kan
kata orang kalau tak jemput tentu telefon kata kenapa tak jemput kan family jauh tu jauh lah tapi tetap i
jauh in the sense of distance lah not is in terms of family tree so macam like there was one example that my friend she just got married like uh think two months ag
err)she was apologising to ah semua like ah sorry ya tak boleh jemput sebab kita nak limit kat family jer then we all macam trying to reassure lah tak apa lah kita faham</malay
we can just view via zoom lah I mean no issue what tapi ya tapi you all are like my like my friends and also macam I feel bad then I was lik
you don't have to feel bad about this you know because you had you are the one who decided to continue this you migrate islam kalau boleh jangan lama lama kan don't delay right but then alah since they actually tuhan dah dah tau eh
so it's not good to delay any further so she is like never mind lah just get ready lah but err but the downside right you cannot go do outside is still kat rumah so limited to I think fifty person right termasuk her family so she was lik
she was happy to get married but then she is like macam sedih because only family is there ah no friend so macam like entah lah I don't know lah whether she still feels bad or not uh so she's been trying to like you come lah you come over to my house lah we will have lik
makan makan session or something but then of course due to schedule lah we cannot commit to certain times right y
because we are considered err sekarang first time righ
ya like like okay lah you can like still had ya know tu I will have to discuss with my own parents but then he will have to take the effort to discuss with his parents also lah and once th
ya you know you we know what we want as dah bilang the parents then at least bila the both sides nak jumpa to discuss further at least they know what we want you know and then
I mean other than that the another one's stress factor yang for him is the duit hantaran actually until now I don't know the difference oh duit hantaran and mas kahwin</malay
so that means so that means it's kalau macam untuk pasal wedding ada yang kasi gelang ada yang kasi cincin that one is okay is i
and then for hantaran that one is considered lik
no no no not the barang hantaran but duit</malay
cheque kosong dah melampau kot actually kalau let's sa
maybe because of all these uh hantaran right I didn't actually eh one post kat Facebook um this err is like a page lah where people can send in their stories anonymously you know like macam those magazin
got married um in iBloom apa ni belum</malay
as in it's not faded lah drag until like baru baru juga lah and then um bagaimana tahu that the husband have a lot of hutang</malay
on top of the wedding tau because it seems that for what I read like this couple has been together for so long but nearly ten years so because dah kenal lama</malay
sejak dulu so they they feel that okay lah since dah kenal lama kan and feels right to move us into to continue with the you know marriage ah so maybe because it'
err macam it's not like they are prepared to go ahead with the marriage is they feels that is the right thing to d
so because of that kan dorang kena ada hutang and then some more at the same time dorang nak dapat rumah which I don't know how lah so macam</malay
the way that she have raised in the story is that dia macam stress like dia yang perlu kahwin tapi you know a lot of things happening then o
then I just found out also my husband have his own debts you know like err bukan apa ni bukan</malay
err loan daripada along lah its like those err school punya fees then dia minta bank loan for study he eh from what I read leh he the husband did investment so investment hilang duit</malay
so because dia tak boleh bayar I don't know lah all this thing I I don't understand lah so so she's like was asking pendapat lah like then I saw a lot of people that why in the first place you go and marry that kin
you know you when you're not ready to so there are like people defending her there are people who are citing her so macam to me like I agree with the people who are defending and citing sama kan
ah against her or citing her so those yang against her right are like macam you kno
a lot of people macam kenapa awak kejam kat dia is her choice whether she wants to go ahead with the marriage and not but to me I personally I feel that if you don't have the money then don't do it lah
tak kisah lah sayang ke kenal lama ke because I've had err friends eh who actually tunang urgent dating lama tunang about two years tapi ended they didn't managed to go throug
wah that means either like they are not ready financially atau just dah tak ada feeling lagi lah which saya macam pelik eh like you tahan for so long as in not say tahan lah dating for so long and the bila tunang you just give up ah
ya lah a bit basically that the reason why she wanted to contribute a story is because dia nak minta pendapat eh
correct but then entah lah I feel like but then to me kan kalau going back to my friend eh um together for seven year
and then tunang for two years and then you break it off to me is that ya you say got dugaan when they tunang tapi I feel that i
you are together for seven years you should go the partner already quite well so apa beza ya when you sarung cincin then oh suddenly all the problems come up you kno
so macam that's what makes it stagnant it's not the fact that oh okay ah lepas ni uh nak fikirkan tinggal mana uh nak duduk mana but it's the fact that oh it'll also that plan you can do i
okay that's the thing that I can already tapi kan the downside right okay with going back to like just one location or just one combined wedding eh is lik
the lauk is not as much as the one at orchard you know it's lik
err if I can remember right the company is only offering five type of lauk</malay
uh the other one is like the basic lah got the rice chicken everything even got like fish and then the like kuih muih ah it's also very limited like some a lot of places are offering ten types righ
he close bridal tahu then I ask the person if let's say I don't want bridal can I change to something else oh ya we can offer you th
kambing golek for about I think uh fifty people or the we'll issue uh like one thousand satay stick
uh as in uh part of the bridal right that means is uh tak salah it's two outfi
two outfit and then with mak andam everything he compared with the price of kambing and satay
who would wanted seh and he still want to charge over thirty dollars per person tahu and they even dare to say you know err because you know lah perangai kita after every wedding mesti will lik
this one tahu they say that you know if let's say there's another event right after your event lah we will have to clear ou
before before the end of the event so for example if your wedding macam pukul dua belas hingga pukul lima and if there is somebody who actually book that event spac
maybe pukul enam ya you have to start clearing by four which to me is not fair I like the one at orchard right the one they really said to me oh
so you want to stay as long as you want tak kisah do you know padahal both of them ar
kirakan muslim company you know malay muslim malay companies lah basically so macam it's not fair you know the way that they trea
who doubt service for the other company is much better tapi the
eh so dah okay eh
tak lah nama nama samaran ke apa tak tahu
masih oh okay okay boleh boleh okay good

okay what if like what what what if like someone confess to you that that she got a crush on you ada
makan kat mana mcdonald
boleh lah tapi macam you guys are still schooling itu semua macam it's a bit too ex for you guys
mm safian dah graduate then now you are in
so got like at least macam basic pay lah I don't know how much then
err habis tu perempuan ni okay this girl like like interested in you tapi dia pun nak pergi high class how will you react
okay what if like macam perempuan ni macam okay lah she she nice tu semua macam dia dia cantik cute apa tu semua okay you like her tu semua
dia punya attitude just
how would you react ataupun dia macam dia dia dia kaki kikis dia macam mesti macam everytime
everytime dia dia cakap macam nak keluar kan mesti kena pergi high class punya tu serious ah
tak what what what if like tak dia punya personality semua bagus okay dia punya attitude but ah baik bukan sucks attitude dia bagus tu semua and all that then dia macam
is like a dream girl macam you know she got everything itu semua
tapi kan
macam she just want to go out with you macam high class restaurant tu semua lepas tu bila kau orang keluar kan tak boleh kena hujan tak boleh kena panas
tak boleh public transport kena grab
tak tak tak tak I want to check the timing so you will like to like to list down pula oh lagi sepuluh minit so you will like rather go out with someone who is like average looking apa tu semua
kalau control macam macam
oh macam dia cheat lah that kind of thing
okay but then again if if someone ada niat untuk cheat right
anything any possible mean and way they can do it ya so macam it doesn't mean on the look macam sometimes dia macam boleh macam
even sometimes macam okay lah I got I got hear and and see before with my own eyes macam muka dia macam biasa jer tau still can cheat
I don't know I don't know how lah but then like is is just possible anything is possible also ya so I guess at the end of the day it's just niat dengan hati

ah ah macam confess ah
okay for girls right sometimes we like to jual mahal like me legit legit so
tak lah I mean like macam ya it's just a phrase like macam
okay then then in order to know if like she is really not interested in you ataupun like like nak jual mahal right you just continue talking to her if she still like continue talking to you right
macam like a few months later then like tengok ah your your chemistry with this person lepas tu try to macam go out with dia tu semua
tapi jangan jangan cakap lagi yang you interested in her so macam if you guys macam rasa macam there's a chemistry between you guys there's like something going on with you guys right
ya lah I mean like I mean okay because you already told her that you are interested in her then she said she's not interested in you what betul tak so so you already accepted accepted that then that's macam for you for you now you think that she treat you as a friend jer so in order to proceed to the next level tanya dia what do you what she see
macam itu because some girls are like just just not interested lah gitu
tapi kalau dia macam fickle minded macam one moment the she she treat you as a err more than friend macam you know macam
more than friend ah macam gitu
cakap no lah we are just friend apa tu semua
yes tu pun fifty fifty ah
sometimes some sometimes girls also dia orang just take advantage of guys macam dia orang cannot cannot be lonely
apa seh berbual pasal tu tapi tengok map wah you search for her ah

god promise you to give you err reward you something macam something better
ya when the time is right is your turn gitu eh
okay lagi two minute

best ah berbual dengan safian satu jam ni
kita kita kalau buat podcast kan kita selalu senyap
you know zuhairi dengan
siapa tu nama dia hafidz
dia orang berbual for like ya dia punya podcast okay dah habis
okay bye dah
baik baik how are you
ya my husband want me to jaga anak-anak and don't want me to work wah so good right my husband
oh wah like that leceh lah
then masak for my husband and kids then ya I feel safer for that lah
aiya tanggungjawab mah tak apa lah boleh
eh batuk-batuk pula
five days is so long imagine you sakit then after that you kena five days
eh tapi
you pernah kena sakit ke
tak ada special queue ke untuk kita
ah tengok lah bila my husband on leave cause ke sebab sekarang kan december holiday kan
ya that's true so sebab tu lah then government baru kasih seratus dolar untuk kita jalan-jalan
oh go lah I see like ada staycation then um holiday then I saw my friend kat facebook lah dia tulis dia cakap dia
for kids one they they get this hundred dollars ke you see lah I haven't got the chance to redeem it
ya lor tapi complain cakap yang ini mahal lah
because staycation is known to everyone that memang mahal but I think
government dah kasih duit tu is good enough
hais susah lah I'm waiting for the COVID to go off so I can
malaysia sepatutnya kasih singaporean masuk I think january but I think sebab case dia orang tiba-tiba naik I don't think it will come that fast lah
the I think the quality got a bit better tapi the inside you can actually put the filter
then the dia punya outer layer yang kena mulut tu is actually very silky so I tak sure lah benda tu really works because ended up my friend felt that it's uncomfortable especially under the hot sun
ya tapi surgical mask need to buy every single time and need to change everyday
oh yang apa tu makan dekat seoul garden ke apa tu eh
oh my that one to bring like what the whole family macam reunion dinner
ya lah but tapi orang-orang ni pun kena lah jaga apa um the
jaga dia apa tu nama dia tengok lah asyik lupa jer apa nak cakap
um jaga
whatever the government say kena ikut but the problem is I think kita pun kena faham orang-orang ni semua dah dah terlalu lama dekat rumah
and then they think it's a good time to actually meet their friends and family and until now phase number three pun masih belum ada apa-apa so I really don't know when phase number three is coming up
ya talking about parents kan my parent is quite old already so during period I tell you I didn't allow her to go out lah sebab
tapi the weird thing is everywhere is still crowded
mm lagi kat got orchard then now what dia orang punya christmas period I think tak ada lah mesti orang-orang ni mesti still have to go to orchard to to buy all these stuff
you know banyak malaysian kerja kat sini kan
they don't have any place to sleep over at uh singapore sekarang
ya lah that's true tapi at least dia orang come up with some um apa tu nama dia solution for the malaysian lah I heard that they give um
oh eh you think ah the people who come to singapore yang malaysia yang
dia orang nak hantar barang you know like those barang-barang kita mostly datang dari malaysia pe
like the sayur like all those foods lah you think they have to go swab test every single time or valid for a few weeks or days
mm eh you remember or not yang masa the first time yang COVID nineteen ni um keluar at news then they were asking for people to be yang swabbers
eh you have any friends working for that or not sebab dia orang tak train kan
wah but I think most of these people yang
jadi swabbers ni maybe dia orang kehilangan kerja kan
then apa dia wear those um protective gear
wah leceh juga eh but I really pity those yang
kena berhenti kerja then they have like what two three anak to feed you see then some of the wife is also like what um home
hmm I think also um government is trying their best to curb this issue just that you know lah some of us ni degil tak nak dengar cakap dia orang
but I feel we should be listening to them at this point of time sebab
like losing their mask so sepuluh kali bagi sepuluh kali hilang
that's why because I feel safer using the surgical mask actually for the kids tapi of course it's a added cost lah imagine sekarang berapa fifteen to eighteen dollars per box
kalau kita dapat murah tak apa juga ni mahal tau
macam mana tu very expensive to have a surgical mask
eh so you don't have plans ah for the december tak ambil leave ke maybe plan outing with your family ke
sebab iya lah special day kan mesti nak duduk luar apa jalan-jalan makan
but tu lah COVID lah restricted
betul lah for me pula tak tanya tapi masih nak bilang kan so for me my family kita nak pergi staycation
kesian budak-budak kan dia orang
okay selalunya saya buat kuih-muih melayu um then birthday cake then kalau saya time
bulan puasa tu saya sempat lah buat kuih raya untuk orang yang order tapi saya buat untuk small scale jer lah kan sebab government pun cuma kasih kita buat untuk family friends only
kalau masak usually I will just cook uh whatever I have in the fridge so sometimes I make like mi bandung um nasi lemak you know those normal stuff sampai tak tahu nak masak apa
betul juga um before this I realised that after the
tapi saya rasa kalau macam gitu deprive others lah untuk beli makan tambahan then you imagine if let's say gaji belum ada tak teruk orang yang diberhentikan kerja semua tak tak cukup untuk beli keperluan yang sepatutnya
ya tapi mana lah orang ni nak ikut undang-undang so maybe what they can what I heard was they go to one and then they go to another in around the same vicinity so I think people are quite smart but at the end of the day you are depriving the rest lah
ah ni cakap pasal masjid ni saya dah lama tak pergi madrasah di masjid
semua sekarang online
doing the delivery like grab apa lagi eh deliveroo I mean it's a decent job but
so I think people with uh young kids sepatutnya maybe could just do something else lah
eh kita ni asyik cakap pasal government aje dah lah kita cakap pasal makanan pula lah mm I'm hungry already do you want to eat
uh eh I saw like they have uh kentang
with kentang then yourself is
but by having this kind of high tech technology eh you see for older generation yang betul-betul tak tahu pakai app they have to go a longer way to to even buy food which is a necessity
cause you imagine orang-orang tua lagi they wanted fresh air they just want to go out you know but of course at this time especially the period dia orang tak boleh keluar tak boleh you know do the normal stuff like even going down
keluar to be free ya that's true so at least not restricted but now with COVID I think
of course government doesn't encourage lah not say that they cannot go out but their immune system is not strong like us lah orang-orang muda macam kita
at this point you how do I say eh macam
mm betul
mm betul tu
tapi saya rasa kalau um mereka diberi peluang untuk belajar
then expose diri dia orang dengan benda-benda macam gini mungkin inshallah dia orang boleh buat
mm betul tu
mm tak apa lah awak pun mungkin mereka akan cuba beli handphone yang
mungkin boleh guna handphone yang senang untuk pakai macam sekarang ada handphone ace samsung ace saya rasa itu senang untuk warga emas menggunakannya lah
tapi saya rasa pun di rumah orang tua not much of um they don't have internet access so that's why nak kena beli line which is also an added cost
sebab mereka tak use internet ah data as much as us kan kalau kita facebook instagram baca news uh semua lah
tapi masalahnya saya tak rasa macam awak cakap tak ramai lah yang mempelajari barang-barang baru seperti ini
mm mungkin
ya tapi saya rasa mungkin lama lagi kot
dengan malaysia begitu indonesia dan ingat tak hong-kong baru-baru ni dia orang nak buka hong-kong balik tapi tak jadi sebab ada about other infection case

is like whenever I see someone else tengah pakai tiktok kan especially the lambang kan
nanti lagu dia is lagu sama keeps repeating
and then nanti like someone will just say
eh nak pakai tiktok pakai earpiece ah diam ah irritating ah
ya ya ya but youtube you can find what you want to find itu yang bagus dia
basically I want to start a new instagram punya account ah
tak tahu asal lah but like instagram more revealing is is quite a thing ah people like really follow they find inspiration from it and
dia got his client's straight from instagram
like they asked for mister grab even though dia tak
mana lah tahu that that photoshop punya skills semua kan photography skill kan I can use to to take ah couple photos with my girlfriend
and pandai kan
instagram is apa famous
okay and then tiba your news feed is like filled with
fitness punya benda eh
outliers macam jujimufu
yang photographer pakai lah
at the subject punya nak ambil gambar tu and then when you raise your hand to block the light kan dia tak ada macam harsh shadows when you cover your hand nanti the the shadow is like very soft
so is like photography level punya lighting is like one on top satu dekat atas satu dekat belakang
ya so nak yang tu yang dekat belakang tu highlight so like you will highlight your back
and then need to buy memory card lagi susah leceh
macam ah
S twenty ultra ada

macam you tak tahu photoshop
pasal you were saying it macam is like really hard like time consuming is not really
you ingat apa sabun

it's just lepak ah
I don't know why doesn't make sense but they say that it's just housekeeping lah so like the another company that moving another battalion right they have to clean imbang ah
our the place that we stay the area all macam hardcore everything
once in a while they will call a private punya cleaner lah
private cleaner once in a while ah kira kan like

berapa ah
no but it's so weird that since we don't know our cousins on papa punya side
you never know I'll be like a lipas you know like can't kill me

I have then then if they see eh tak lawa sia nak kena pakai more makeup mm I I I really like
that's why I say greatest masterpiece that's why nanti clinic dia naik nama tau
then nanti people start sending barang lagi sebab dah lawa
then they send like endorsement hantar barang apa tu tak ke
places to grab maybe what apa
you want to know from where east spring secondary school previously now mana
cause if your underwear is ketat right so it's
hais makan one meal per day pun tetap tetap ada the
the babat
wah I keep on going up and down the stairs my kaki sakit sia
tu ah
telur with kicap
ee ee uh uh sia briyani makan dengan kicap rasa apa ah
should I try and see how it taste like I ate the briyani with belacan just now not bad
but the but the belacan overpowers the briyani taste
cakap apa sia kucing ini
like fries with sambal belacan with kicap
no like as in the sambal belacan and kicap is the sauce
apa then the the other two was like oh can we have more water then after I serve water then they say oh this
and apa ah dia cakap that mat salleh was saying like oh it wakes up the japanese man
then I was like mm part mana sambal dengan japanese eh
it's good you know like the nanny suara dia macam janice yang from friends
that voice dia buat-buat jer
when I read books they say oh her aura change then I was like macam mana sia aura boleh tukar then
nasal yang hidung punya voice
hais I need to eh ada surgery tak untuk buat lebih tinggi
then six months is it or one year yang tak boleh jalan
tangga I know I know
got a few people will say like you know I feel like I want to squeeze you then put inside my pocket I was like apa sia aku kecil gila apa sia dia orang nak buat gini
pakai heels pun like
we were googling on uh how to grow taller then ada they got sell some pills and stuff but then they say
lajukan your hormones or something like that
okay uh ya dia bukan friday sebab friday shafie dia kena
pergi sekolah so dia kata
uh kalau dia dah penat
dia tak enjoy so he wants
dia tak ada eh ada
tapi shafie nak involve
ya lah memang si june
tak payah mark sebab dia tak ada
oh over there got itu apa Marybrown
affaf punya bukan dua lagi tu
si affaf boleh lah because her
uh the other two they don't need to go pun
knowing si apa knowing si
dia dia yang boleh kita pergi rumah kak ogi
kalau datang rumah kita tak boleh if we go out I keep saying to the kids
it's just nice eight eight person the children saja
I mean if you don't want to leceh then just do it at home lah kat rumah kak ogi
one you contact kak ogi
then what what she say lah then after that baru
cause I think for us kita yang tak jumpa aisyah dengan
si kecil tu at least kak ogi jumpa juga lah once and then ayah tu jumpa kan
bila raya lah
think raya haji tak salah
eh buat juga lah
macam okay so it depends
uh because sekarang ni yang paling ramai is either mahir or amin
kan kat rumah yang paling ramai so we either go to mahir's house or amin's house
kalau si lina dia happy kat rumah amin ah because it's more apa orang tu tak ada kucing
tak so ertinya we cannot come one time pun it's just macam contoh lah eh
so kita bawa mak dengan si matin
pergi rumah amin so kita lapan orang lah kita jumpa amin dengan budak-budak tu kan
ah then second group could be andir dengan si mahir
bawa the children ah
ah eh eh tapi andir dengan si mahir dah tak boleh eh
tak boleh eight groups is eight groups that's why you cannot that's why kalau nak jumpa kena macam
so contoh contoh eh
then uh maybe mahir send his kids but dah berapa
seven plus uh si kecil tu akil akif
anak amin kat rumah dia so already join in lah
ah adoi ya lah but if nak have a cousin gathering then can
get together before ini I think maybe okay lah tapi kalau let say it is um
so uh apa all the cousins meet one time
then okay balik
tapi kesian juga kalau macam gitu okay kalau macam gitu
anak-anak saudara jer
so they can't sit together pun I mean they won't sit together pun
correct kalau dekat rumah amin ada lah dia orang bermain
so to me biar anak-anak saudara ni semua all the children can come down at one time
mm asyik datang rumah dia dia pun penat dia pun nak makan angin juga nak jalan-jalan sikit
kita biar budak-budak semua pergi amin you handle the kids
kita uh adults alright bye bye kita go for our
so and then andir selalu kan tu
so it's not like ini lah it's the together ramai-ramai yang tak ada
so one of my suggestion is that lah uh let the kids all kumpul kat rumah si amin so at least the kids
once you step out the house tak boleh
okay other than that then they all meet at tu their ayah teh house
ayah teh will be very happy all come come come
abang is stress with his schoolwork already so we have to see how it's going to be
how and what else can we do with mama
then we ajak mak
that weekend ah the christmas weekend twenty six ke twenty seven
so if let's say you want to pergi pun boleh pakai wheelchair kat situ
jewel kan dia ada all those uh tours right
ada waterfall lah
the the apa the atas tu ada the the apa
tak ada lah dia ada cakap apa semalam wasn't supposed to be the timing to do homework
dia ada dia punya own timing
not today is tomorrow kakak dia ajak tomorrow
he he say he doesn't want memang he already say he uh a lot of his friends ask he all he told all of them
ya that's why that's why I say so lepas ni she have to go to apa ni
because I cakap dengan dia
that lecturer yang quite good lah she talk to him quite a bit
if you he teach at these two uni dua-dua uni dia ajar
murdoch ah dengan northumbria so dia ajar
so dia kata memang kat northumbria
whereas dekat murdoch
you dah buat all those work you submit on top of that you have to take up another
err coursework lah another apa testing test
no she already memang in this line
dia dah memang buat communication so she can
officers came into the class and dah explain pun everything tapi uh
even that wira guy is telling her that northumbria is the one to go lah
uh adult already cuma I don't know in terms of
and then now they tell us dah tak ada uh two time
all ah all of the ni ya
ya lah so for example the other time dia pergi M
tu actually not bad and I saw the programme pun macam bagus tau dia ada sound recording space
mana kawan dia atau overseas actually going overseas
so unless you want to open up lah and say okay go maybe australia ke mana
practise apa maksudnya
that's why okay another option is tengok dekat malaysia
because malaysia pun banyak twinning programme
and twinning programme dia pun not bad quite good
anak ustaz ah
ah so actually we just limit it to singapore cuma masalahnya sekarang dia ambil kaplan
so with that diploma kalau dia masuk kat tempat lain
one more year tapi it's just one more year ya lah
tapi ya lah dia at the end of the day apa
budak ni nak buat shafie mati-mati nak buat photography right he wants to be a photographer
shafie dia once he is focused on
so that part is good lah he kalau betul-betul interested he will read up he will find out he will follow and all that
bukan yang dia she's actually a football coach
she is literally a football coach so when I saw that I was like huh apa kejadah ni so she apply K
uh anak tiga ke apa tak tahu she is she used to teach in preschool
ya so if this lady she is okay to doing english and maths then that's where we can macam
ya lah I mean that is not the whole idea pun the whole idea is we want to use
up two classes so that we can earn the money right so kalau let's say we just use up one class then it's a waste of
resources pun
you you go and pause ke apa
no lah tak you tekan the other side oh my god oh my god okay
oh he he message he say kak I cannot get a staff so I regret to inform that I cannot do it
but if if if cannot get the numbers itu yang ini kan
session tu yang I told ira ira kalau let's say parents datang they already want to sign up you don't have to send them for the diagnostic session ah I cakap
because you can still do the assessment on the first day dia datang tu you can do
tapi kalau let's say dia
so dia accept dia P three still have to give the
if ya so on the first day dia datang
dia buat the assessment dulu that assessment shouldn't take fifteen fifteen minutes should be finish
so ira angguk-angguk don't whether she faham ke she agree ke will do ke tak tahu
I cakap dengan dia print the progress report do the apa
so that tomorrow we print out semua all one time lah so that's why I want to know what is it
I don't know eh to me macam it's okay lah you just print out pun okay black and white apa
don't have to turun you have to pass to the children
uh final apa the progress report whatever whatever we can still give the soft copy to them
kita tak kasi apa yang sepatutnya kita kasi on in june
uh Kumon pun cakap the same thing
so he the new centre yang dia nak run uh a franchise tu
okay so he has been teaching when he was in um school dulu dia mengajar
uh part time part time lah macam uh he take up one or two uh students that kind of thing
ah banking dia banking so he was already working in
so kena lay-off
okay dia dia
but he has always been doing tuition macam his part time lah and all
orang serani so he he used that word you know he say saya orang serani he say like that I was like ah
understanding at first so he learnt how to overcome it right so that's why he say now he can macam
entah eh no nama dia chen kang eh
tu lah I have to ask the children how to sebut nama dia so is ya
see the it uh the indian lady pun okay
then kita ada two more options lah ya
and then we can also work on apa kata orang tu
nisa kan dia cakap dia cuma nak ambil kalau suami dia punya cuti falls on ni
we're talking about the cake jadi asal dengan cake tadi
ya I saw the picture then after that you terus tukar daripada gambar jadi message from gambar then it become a message that is where saya macam
so that that was the part when I actually eh ah you ask you ask me cake because you didn't mention macaron lagi so it was just cake
but I I didn't know the the macaron was choose a'ah sebab tu saya tanya
but she didn't say what oh it's a mix eh macaron dia mix colour jer ah
is it oh you can choose different like I I I I don't eat macarons always so saya a bit lost
tapi flavour no no no awak macam banyak-banyak flavour does it incur cost ataupun sama jer harga
oh okay I thought macam
oh it's not like semua satu satu satu macam err what you call it alternate macam selang-seli ah tak eh okay okay
mana dapat contact
orh abeh dia punya review is good
so the cake tak sedap ah
abeh the thing is kita tak boleh try dulu ke abeh macam gini a bit
oh by right kita boleh datang and taste correct so kalau kalau kita order sikit dia tak they don't sell macam kek tu a small portion that we can buy and taste
inshaa allah lah takde apa-apa lah can lah
so that is cake that is done dah habis
huh I don't apa yang two hour frame err saya tak faham
two hour time frame I think in advanced for them to get there I think oh okay I think I saya rasa they need to get there dorang nak kena stack up nak kena susun they need two hours for it to get ready so that means dalam macam they need to be there by six or something like that by seven they need to do the susun ah that's why they need two hours just in case tak it's a buffer time
okay ah I I could be right betul saya rasa ada chance betul
but because usually cake tak akan datang terus dah diri gitu they need to susun letak and then they macam ah tu lah a'ah ah mmhmm
cause I saw the message your mum macam nanti letak something decoration or something like that apa tu dia nak apa
dia nak apa your mum nak suruh macam jangan plain gitu ah so ada ada decoration
biar lah by the way tadi nabil call call you first eh dia call you first is it
oh okay K K K K so I think I think dia macam terperanjat ah I think oh I haven't answer their question so dia call saya saya dia cakap actually I talked to hakimmah oh then I macam eh asal dia call saya tak sempat ya tak kari instant tu kira baru letak baru letak dia message saya tak sempat nak message dia dah dah reply awak pun dah keep asking questions terus saya macam eh okay wait
tak awak terus tak awak terus ah terus you mmhmm ah correct ah correct mmhmm so dia terus err awak terus reply balik tak sempat saya nak baru nak type kira uh okay I was about to type sekali awak terus dah uh I didn't I don't know the answer it's like oh okay I was I was about to tell you yang he mention uh okay this is what he said to me lah dia cakap
I don't know I tak sempat
then you told your mum to delete atau dia just dia paiseh tak I think what nabil is trying to accommodate dia dia cakap yang macam orang tak makan macam those who are working for the wedding they will try to put as crew uh huh that's what he said lah that's why kalau apa-apa
so anyway yang tadi dia cakap err dia kata kalau I think I think the ambassador tanya ke apa he say just tell them they are part of the crew jer he will also say lah they part of the crew that's what he told me mm so kira it's like macam we have to be on the same page ah dia cakap gitu jer
oh ah okay I thought she gonna ask question I I I was wondering apasal I didn't save your mum's number tadi saya tengah macam terfikir ni siapa I it's either I it's a the the the boss atau your mum so I was looking at it okay you added it then that number belongs to your mum I should save it
so cepat that was very fast I think she she posted lama eh maybe I was saya yang lambat lah
oh ya homework besok besok besok besok besok I besok saya ada site then sekejap jer pukul tiga ah then after that dah boleh insha allah pasal besok I
ya we can do like this also on friday ke
to dia punya problem friday friday should be okay I think
tu ah
pasal belum confirm pe pasal kalau awak dah pilih that means saya pilih jer I think you go with your mum first
mm once dah confirm
oh jadi nanti next time kalau tidak bila saya datang pun dia nak kena okay tak dia tapi dia ada intention to go any other places tak lepas tu
tak ah kita
tak payah lah kita keep to the minimum kalau saya ikut begum jer settle
ah let your mum choose lah takpe
tadi dia datang ah dia datang petang pe lambat terus a'ah dia daripada site so dia datang dia datang terus dia cakap eh uh hakimmah hakimmah minta aku favour tolong terus saya I just senyum jer ah tanya tolong apa jadi emcee eh a'ah seh aku the last time jadi emcee was poly time seh dia cakap gitu ah that's what he said
I just say like macam takde lah apa yang susah sangat engkau cuma cakap okay sekarang sudah mah that's why saya cakap senang jer kau announce macam sekarang sudah masuk waktu azan dah lepas tu kau cakap okay sekarang kita nak akad nikah ah boleh ramai-ramai duduk gitu jer bukan kau suruh suruh berbual-bual interact takde I told him no you don't have to do that you just need to talk bila benda dia nak jadi kau bilang just inform jadi orang macam uh takpe takpe takpe takpe aku nak berbual pasal hakimmah ngan kau I macam merepek you know lah him you know lah him he always likes to macam kacau-kacau takpe takpe aku ada aku
a'ah dia abeh dia kata aku make sure hafiz S pun kena get involved I don't know biar biar jangan lepas tu then he said jangan jangan dia menggigil sudah
tapi I think yang yang yang pasal sound system I don't know they allow us to touch or not sometimes ada orang tak pasal dia dia ya sometimes they they don't allow you to touch you know
usually they don't allow to touch ah tapi kalau kita tahu
I think provided kalau takde event before that that means we can come early tau macam pasal slot before us is kosong uh
so okay lah maybe macam cake semua boleh set up siang kalau kalau let's say uh grab time
syafiq dengan rahmat um kalau ada kereta boleh lah dorang tengokkan kalau tak siapa lagi seh tengok rahmat is a actually syafiq dengan rahmat boleh lah syafiq boleh ambil awak atau rahmat can just stay there
ya but the plan is sekarang kakak cakap amirul will take care dengan bapa semua jadi itu part so kita kita focus on our side jer
that's why I think I set up saya pakai kat situ juga so that means
tu lah okay
boleh lah as in kita I don't know how is the rule I don't know macam mana kan semua
ya lah correct that means baru saya datang from home kat situ pula ya ya ya a'ah
so that means I tak macam gini tau you can pakai baju kat situ tau eh actually dah boleh pakai baju makeup yang pakai kat sana
makeup oh kira dah kat sana juga eh like that
kalau kalau tidak I I don't know for my side ada pak andam ke tidak ah ataupun pakai macam mana pakaian so kalau tidak
it's that atau I get is isn't it groom
from what I know eh kadang tak ada pak andam uh usually they will show mungkin kalau kalau groom tu nanti they will show the groom atau someone who's gonna be close to me how to wear it kalau dia boleh catch up boleh pick up then tak payah so after that dia pakaikan kalau tidak then that means nak kena get kakak punya kawan tu ah yang siapa I don't know georgie ke sofian I think that that's the name something like that that guy boleh buat dia memang a'ah
eh uh kalau rizal ada
eh uh kalau rizal ada okay ah tak the thing is dia nak kena ada orang yang tahu kalau ada orang tahu senang kalau takde nanti eh macam mana nak pakai ah pasal dia nak kena ikat
tak tahu I think tak lah actually the best tapi the best is belajar dulu
tak the thing is you need to teach who kalau teach sendiri saya boleh buat sendiri it's simple as that tapi dia nak kena pin kan ikat kan
that's why just just need to learn jer everything on YouTube most sekarang correct
oh malay dance ajar ikat kain eh
okay anyway tadi kita tulis
tak actually dia simple jer dia ikatkan sekejap jer dia ikatkan tu jer tak payah pegang apa-apa dia ikat tu dah then I can go off already I don't know nak kena pakai makeup I don't need to wear makeup pe kan
ada orang macam eh touch up touch up okay wait sabar are you going to put inai
lelaki tak payah lah tak perlu kalau tak nak boleh
what do you think saya kalau boleh tak payah lah inai tapi ah ya I I I just don't want to nanti
ya lah kalau cakap tak mahu nanti your mum pakai lah inai bukan okay tu kekok
uh okay kita tengok apa jawapan dulu
actually lelaki tak perlu
mm tak pakai tak payah lah okay the we were talking about prep time for wedding then after that what else what other questions
apa food oh ya
lepas saya akad nikah doa tentu ada kalau amik gambar usually I don't know ah your abang ambil gambar macam mana pasal ada orang ambil gambar okay ambil gambar dengan card
is it uh tak tahu ah kalau ikut macam standard eh orang kahwinnya eh macam dorang yang biasa ambil gambar kahwin dengan tok kadi nanti ambil gambar dengan certificate tu ah yang kahwin lepas tu nanti kat be safe dorang macam ambil doa and then uh doa suami isteri what you want to do ah macam ada doa between the two of us ada ah there is a doa a'ah ada doa ada sunnah tak tak not depan orang ah saya pasal saya sarongkan cincin pe lepas tu ada doa that part pun ada gambar so kita gitu gedebak-gedebuk maybe eight thirty eight forty five itu jer about macam
asal kita tak kita tak takde takde apa-apa pun makan jer lepas tu
family tak okay kita kasi makan eh masa makan tu okay nanti turn by turn turn by turn kita maybe
boleh lah makan I think ya kita pasal sekejap nanti after that kita lima the thing is kita lima puluh orang jer kita tak pergi mana-mana we're not gonna move around should be okay
a'ah I think they will serve on the table already this nanti dorang dah habis terus dia duduk
okay maybe maybe kita kasi dorang makan I think pun tak makan lama pun setengah twenty minutes then after that orang kasi makan macam twenty minutes kita pun makan kita makan orang makan jadi kita semua makan ah jadi jadi ya lah that's why I say kita makan dorang makan dah makan terus ambil gambar ambil gambar baru kita potong kek last last part macam gitu
is it I don't know oh makeup semua eh oh a'ah lah okay probably macam go by table by table ah
got go ah mm we call out table by table ah as in macam mesti lima orang go ah a'ah ah ya correct correct correct
kita makan last bungkus sudah
tak cake cut is the last usually last from what I remember last sekali last event macam gini eh okay macam gini eh kalau dorang ada dua tiga pakaian nanti the last pakaian baru dorang potong kek lepas tu baru buat ucapan so itu dah makan tau ah ya
packaging tu apa tupperware

okay dah
ada ada kat you give the link pasal you just put you make a list on your spotify my my spotify ah then after that in sequence we'll be playing
okay from what I know ah eh macam venue gini kalau awak tak ada emcee dia err takde emcee usually what what usually kalau awak engage emcee there will be a the emcee it's either he can control ah ya lah this is what I know lah ataupun you will use your own relative to control the mic ah that's what they allow mm mm mm mm
okay actually kalau dia set setakat untuk berbual pe set kan untuk berbual just fade up fade down jer pe pelan-pelan jer tak payah kuat-kuat kita lima puluh orang lagu-lagu ah ya lah correct
play the song ah fade up lagu sikit mmhmm
a'ah boleh
tak tahu apa board
oo yang Yamaha kecil punya berapa
should be lah that one tak kan besar oh wait dia dia masukkan dekat sound board oh okay okay I saw already I saw the speaker on a yang okay speaker dia boleh tahan enough lah to cover then the board jer saya tak nampak okay lah takpe lah
lagu jer I think tak payah main kuat-kuat then the the list of song actually I have a few songs ah
standard lah qasidah-qasidah relax relax I think before that saya saya actually tengah tunggu nak maghrib tu saya saya nak tunggu maghrib tu saya nak suruh ustaz hakeem err kalau ustaz hakeem datang ah I just want him to recite a few qasidah tengah tunggu recite qasidah tapi takut dia paiseh dia sorang mm mm
a'ah sebelum nikah so sambil sambil tunggu tu qasidah sikit baca doa tapi boleh ah I think can do doa selamat while waiting pasal nanti bukan doa selamat ah baca zikir ustaz hakeem memang sorang pun dia power tapi kalau ustaz hakeem pegang mic tak kesah dulu dia okay tapi selalunya ustaz hakeem kalau pegang mic ah wahab dah start godeh board that's what I know kalau ustaz hakeem masuk jer dia godeh board
mm tak usually kalau kalau wahab dah godeh board correct correct usually wahab kalau godeh board dia will do as in general jer enough kalau uh ustaz hakeem dia adakan echo lah but it takes a while pe to get it kita tengok macam mana lah tapi
usually I think ustaz boleh baca qasidah sikit ke atau berzikir I think actually okay usually he likes to do that lah it would be nice jadi tak nervous sangat aku terima nikahnya aku terima nikah
firdaus hari-hari seh sekarang jumpa aku jumpa like he keep saying aku terima aku terima dia keep saying dia dia pasal dia nya dah nak dekat
tak dia tak stressful dia kata just sekarang ingat jer ah macam main-main main-main ah just main-main the with the thing jadi bila on the day dah macam kat lidah pe just hujung hujung aku terima nikah nama nama nama dengannya okay pasal that's how you practise you just keep saying it as in as in it's normal lama lama terus okay like that

I don't know if their they they they can switch to YouTube music ah hopefully lah we can we can always ask boleh can switch between switch between the two mmhmm I think they gonna let us use the laptop I think they gonna let use the laptop sebab tu dia kata can use the video montage
I think that one that one from my that one my side your one sirih dara kakak I think kakak ada contact ah I think can ask the guy
oh okay then keep to your mum contact dah
gubahannya tray
actually actually the gift the gift semua kita kasi kat dorang dorang settle kan kan that's what I know
kalau kita sewa dulang a'ah a'ah
a'ah dulang hantaran lah kan I want to to say to you

okay wait pasal kelmarin kakak cakap yang kawan dia tu georgie semua amirul dah contact pasal dia yang pinjamkan dia yang ada dulang tu so kalau kita ada barang tu semua kita kasi pada dia kan dia siapkan then on the day kita tinggal ambil jer semua dah siap
okay okay kalau kalau kalau betul your mum nak beli do your own ada time tak kalau kalau
tak pasal kelmarin kakak already told me yang dia tu pernah buat I saw yang dulang kakak punya ah dorang they
is it I don't know kita tak I don't know
kita belum discuss pe pasal dulang
ya takpe lah tu that one can discuss later lah for this one
jap eh
oh ya know not yang firdaus punya venue he said he told me eh aku venue yes dia buat tiga ratus
pasal ah tapi dia cakap fifty by fifty that's why I said saya cakap kita punya tak boleh dia kata pasal shah ibrahim was daring enough to
ya lah fifty at one time so that means somehow pasal I think most of the venue don't want to take the risk fifty fifty fifty pun still the same people pe keep coming kan so I think most venue don't want they just do fifty jer so I think shah ibrahim somehow
but but because that time tak silap saya dia cakap adik eh mak dia pergi maknya firdaus ni went for the wedding one of the cousin wedding it already happening lah shah ibrahim allow macam said ah uh the mum saw dia punya invite is I think about a few hundred so ada orang ambassador eh no I think orang or ambassador is down there to uh overlook kat depan ah he standing in front ah ya ya ya ya ya correct correct correct I think that's I think that's how he managed to convince them ah as in okay you can see at how we provide lah I think that's the procedure macam gitu
dia datang mmhmm mmhmm tapi memang
itu I told him I saya tanya firdaus dah habis kau pak saudara-mara kau pun yang jaga tak [ah] I think he will
dia pakai mesin tu pe remember that thing
abeh kita nak kena kita nak kena submit name eh
for us to make ah because we know oh no pasal kita tahu pe who are our guests dah itu jer
fifty people okay lah considered as our guest list ah but for us also our part is to just record lah nama kalau apa-apa jadi pun just pump kasi nama jer correct who are coming we just record itu ah itu jer correct
no of course not siapa nak subscribe
that's why then asal tak pakai awak punya
I know I remember but just I was I was doing I was writing down something dah
tripod small tripod stand small tau very small kecil punya kecil betul-betul kecil for the cam ah kan ada dia ada yang
use the same wi-fi to sync I don't know need to try I I I need to google I need to do a bit of research I don't know need to check cause from what I saw yesterday was using but then probably boleh pakai on by wi-fi kalau by wi-fi that means boleh gerak orang just hold dekat jer anyway it's really small kecil gila so it's easy ah to hold it kalau tidak orang pakai chest pack ah
tak pasal you have to face it have to face that's why dia punya screen face us macam very awkward awkward lah you have to see yourself I don't want
that now but like abeh laptop dia the thing is the laptop is big you have to keep shifting around orang leceh seh nak pegang kalau benda tu kecil dia boleh pegang pakai tangan and then just turn left right turn left right jer which is more better rather than you shift the whole screen every time just to adjust angle
work from home and then besok I got one site pukul tiga
tak ah sekejap jer pergi site
saya saya pergi site survey that's it takde pergi office
ya lah about one hour nya tempat pasal ni bukan really pasal dia macam just resurvey kita dah ada barang tu just need to shift it somewhere a proper location like in another location ah mm mmhmm
ya ya should be sempat lah it cannot be that long
sama macam fajr juga I think it's just a stage where
tak pasal tangan mak kakak I think tangan terus pump jadi tahu I think you can never spare the kid
mm tapi bukan
I think bukan pukul sampai sakit pukul just to ah
ah even even even macam just just to macam sepak pakai tangan pun macam just like that just dia tahu dia eh kena jadi dia tahu eh sakit okay so stop a'ah lah mm bukan sampai lah dera banting takde lah not like that
anyway tadi yang the video I send to you was too long
oh that's why you said it was too long but but actually it's quite good lah it it gives macam ustaz tu used to I went I used to went for his classes last time
ustaz madarrus he used to be in singapore now he's I think at mmhmm mm so I went for his classes last time ada cerita juga lah cerita dia so anyway he's quite good honestly kalau tanya saya baik so the the sister ask you saw the question right the sister ask about men
not being good leaders that kind of thing ah and then he he agree to it lah and then he explained why maybe the reason why things happen men nowadays boys nowadays doesn't turn out to be macam have a leadership have leadership ah responsibility like old people dorang kan ada responsibility it's just that nowadays we are okay ah simply put I also understand ah dia cakap macam nowadays err parents okay macam dia cakap parents usually perempuan takpe tak boleh balik lambat perempuan very strict semua tak boleh ya dia macam partly part
exactly pasal dorang apply to girls that's why tu dia cakap and then
mm then yang itu that's the problem pasal I think believe dulu orang kampung macam macam mana pun nanti kalau orang-orang lama pun ah nanti macam mana pun they will still start teaching the boys to tak responsibility kau nak kena jaga adik kau macam gitu
macam wah bagus pe kau bagus macam the the the biasness eh biasness
tak tahu ah I think sekarang happening to us is the modern and then we are too exposed dengan
ya lah western it's come from western that's why dulu orang kampung dia cakap budak-budak lelaki they they they become matured faster pasal the dad I I think the further the behind part they explain a lot of things ah macam it the mother also play a role dia kata macam not to strike not strike fear tau macam to gain respect for macam the mother hold the status of the father macam make the status among the the children they fear the father fear the father macam respect tau yes pasal dia cakap macam
mm abeh yes dia kata macam dulu orang cakap bapa balik jer tak payah bapa cakap balik nampak bapa balik takde tunggu straightaway masuk rumah punya bapa tak payah tenung pun dia step tak nampak jer automatically come home you know pasal automatically the father have this respect already abeh macam the mum dia kata hold this status macam okay ni bapa kau punya cawan kau jangan pegang macam ini pinggan bapa kau punya kau jangan makan dari bapa kau punya pinggan macam the mother so dia macam keep dia gitu tau so dia kata the father is the leader of the family and the mother is the leader of the household and children macam gitu so but overall it's still the father ah so dia kata nowadays even the father lack that macam I don't know what happened lah but then dia kata the fathers just lack lack
abeh dia kata yes ah tu ah he was talking about that also that was that one thing also
then then he said then he also mentioned mentioned this thing ah men have ego and men always wanted to be needed faham kan wants to be needed
yes that's the thing perempuan asyik I want I'm independent dia kata tak boleh the the rule of a man is to be needed kalau kau take away that he's not needed dia a very yes that's one thing ataupun dia punya ego mati nanti dia terus macam abeh dia kata that's why a lot people fall into depression pasal guy not needed women are independent dia cakap gitu that that's the tapi it's a this is the theory ah
dia kata ya
dia kata tak the thing is macam dia dia kata ada there was this one person who came up to me ustaz I'm married I have children and then I I don't have a problem but the main problem is my husband dia cakap gitu so actually I can earn my own money but I don't need him but I don't know why I'm married lepas tu ustaz tak boleh cakap apa-apa I don't know why I'm married macam I think it's just pasal no the thing is she is a woman tak bukan tak sayang I think over time dia ada children dia busy kerja they live too long together you get tired of the guy get tired of the guy something like that
okay wait kalau you have a kids that means you separate from your kids ah just the two of
the bond ah the bond together ah macam have adventures ah
develop again ah oh ya rekindle ah kira ada semangat membara balik
tak okay eh I think it's easy to say the thing is it's easy to say tau but then kalau awak tengok eh the context of singapore in the context of singapore susah you see eh sekarang jer to survive some you you look at the household lelaki bini nak kena
activity lah a'ah ya correct tak payah spend money ya just to macam cycling I can yes yes mmhmm mm
tetapi kan mm tapi still and then macam this kind of thing is one of the thing tapi macam dalam every day tu macam kalau boleh macam dapat solat jemaah macam malam together that would be ya that that how the ya that that's how you ah mmhmm that's like how to
ya lah nowadays ya lah tapi mak cakap
ya boleh boleh tak salah a'ah boleh memang boleh macam saya solat jemaah kat masjid mm
mm can ah ya boleh kan dah cakap macam suami nak gi dia suka sembahyang jemaah kat masjid so just go solat masjid jemaah balik dia imamkan isteri lagi ah boleh no nothing wrong with that pasal isteri have to do her chores abeh dia nak solat jemaah pe kesian kan solat lah bagus think this kind of thing can can can keep ourselves
a'ah lah tapi
tapi macam macam firuz mm macam firuz he likes to solat macam firuz is see so far lah firuz and amira like to solat jemaah so I think they don't want to solat sendiri-sendiri so which is good also lah
kadang-kadang firuz bawa solat tapi firuz punya al-fatihah good seh saya kadang-kadang macam eh you haven't pray ah you pray on your own first lepas tu saya dengarkan lah I correct him then it's okay

cause they don't want ah they want to be the same on par with the Malaysian punya apa orang kata commission

I don't know for me right cause she refunded us she got a lot of evidence nanti dia cakap dia ada evidence lah gedebak gedebuk lah you know but maybe ah kalau ada satu orang cakap anyone has any dealing with Aminah Muslim before muslimah before maybe I think a lot of people will comment
ya husnuzon lah mm
I mean ya I try but I'm not gonna order from her anymore the thing is I'm angry with her I'm quite upset cause she mentioned that I am dia punya regular customer which is which I my first time seh
how can you share a my conversation with another person saying that I'm to to to show that you are konon honest gitu lah kan
oh cause ah aku baca dia cakap nak kena uh only uh berapa percent jer melayu
no no melayu nak kena kurang daripada English actually
yes that's right so that's why you've been talking melayu all the way kan ah so you have to you cannot dia macam nak kena ada sixty percent of uh I think it's lower
so apa ni uh so that's why lah aku rasa macam
ah aku quite upset with her cause she you know she just mentioned my name without apa ni
suka suka cakap aku ni macam dia cover up her her her apa
ya cause she also mentioned to the person yang dia punya husband is not working for a few months already
the the one who sustain the business is the one yang dia scam kita you get what I mean or not
at times at times dia bukan kat situ at times bapa her father-in-law dia mother-in-law dia melayu
and laki dia melayu
uh huh dewa
ah all the Malay punya ni ah
mm so maybe she but but the person who uh the the refunded yang one K tu dia pergi dia dah pergi kedai dia
she was there but the second time that she came down it was the bapa mertua
ah yes so that's why she doesn't want to make a scene dia keluar daripada kedai tu dia tunggu si Aminah Muslim ni dekat dah lah aku tak tahu nama dia betul Aminah Muslim ke tak padahal dia put Aminah Muslim aje agaknya
and then after that dia apa ni uh she buy time again ah buy time
she doesn't even have actually supposedly that time she have to pay seven hundred okay sekali terus dia cakap ah I only have
ya lah she scam another person lah babe she go and advertise she say who want to buy wholesale then people like us macam aku will go and message her and then she will say oh minimum this kind of amount thirteen dollars per piece you know that kind of thing
then uh in fact um this Aminah Muslim right uh the the other the other party who was also scammed by her ah dia also use the same tactics like said the delivery man run away with the items
the the Thai suppliers told her that Aminah Muslim tak order langsung
so which sources and then Aminah Muslim Aminah Muslim ni macam cakap uh please show me the message macam dia ada cakap buat apa aku nak show kau message tu seh
dia kena buku dengan ruas eh yang orang suka kaki viral eh she will get it ah confirm
that's why that's why macam kita have to apa orang kata ambil sikit-sikit ah cuma aku nak tahu juga si Lia tu dapat daripada mana ni
mm that one is a love your style that one is love your style dia punya Facebook
oo okay I saw the the advertisement also she have a few uh few uh apa ni baju which is the same
twenty five lah dia tu
mm I hope this one is true lah at least we have a you know direct supplier yang trustable lah you know
I already told her just give us uh new design you tell us lah cause malaysia punya boleh dapat lebih cepat apa
mm I'm not sure tapi tengok daripada Thai Thai punya supply juga I think
eh have you seen that patchwork that retro patchwork yang the baru punya retro marble ah
uh yang si Sadiah tu pun bawa and I saw a few others yang bawa
this it's it's pleated but it's the same like marble design but the colours are more glaring yang dia ni pun ada tunjuk aku Jenny ni dia ada tunjuk aku juga the colours lah but I I I feel like we already have the marble right right
ni pun tengok tengok ni lah babe tengok rezeki orang ah
ya ada yang big pleats ada yang smaller pleats
ada yang macam the quality yes ada yang termasuk
ya for me aku rasa yang macam ada tunic tu tunic is also considered as pleats kan tapi dia tak macam pleats sangat kau faham tak macam dia ada spread
ya cause I think the ruffle dress is pendek
just put it at Nina Sazali it will be a hot kicks lah for us habis lah
ah like they said dream big to have a shop or whatever I don't have that dream to to make it into a shop macam aku nak pergi sewa kedai ke I don't have until that goals you see
ya and overhead kau nak kena ada manpower
macam gini ambil macam sambil lewa sambil lewa you know just on and as and when
ya so that's why for me when I do this um online thingy it's actually for for aku to stay at home to do side income not for me to go out and go to another shop
yes true cause my kids are still small I I'm I'm also working in the morning you see so I don't see maybe like flea market I'm okay with that cause it's a one once and on on and off punya event
but I think if you buy the garment kau tahu you know the steamer the garment steamer that one left hand
berapa dah lima puluh ke kau eh fifty eh okay oh ya you're forty now ah
eh age doesn't matter okay it's just your dream to achieve it the dream even Saadiah ah she said lah next year kita buka kedai lah I was like seriously
dia nak boutique you know boutique she wants to open a boutique like her dream is very big ah you know like inside my heart oh no way I'm not gonna dream that big you know
but then again I I think that she is like what you know semangat lima minit kind of person
oh kucing ah oh okay cat fighting ya
okay so like like I said lah so I mean I'm not jealous of the sales or whatever but I'm just a bit pissed off at how she can like berkinja-kinja you know at the live she used my words like wanita lindungan kaabah all these you know and then but with me huh pening lah pening lah pening lah over here pening over there pening
the other one is the lady's punya ah um dia punya apa ni ah anak mmhmm
ya tak ada hati ya cause of the way she treated me as a what
ya and then what she's find find me so low class meh cause I don't have any I got a condo maybe you get what I mean like for me lah never mind lah I mean we can find our own supplies I mean surely but slowly ya slowly slowly we can you know memang we never come out with a lot of money lah but then again we just order a bit by bit whatever we can lah mm
one one person one person one who really wanted so I I already told her that one is the Saadiah punya friend ah she wanted to buy she messaged me just now
nanti barang tak datang and then after that people will chase us I don't like all these you know I don't want to drama drama
ya my my mother side a lot eh my mother nya auntie dia punya buat downline banyak seh eh I think eh this thing is very good lah sarah I mean I'm the one who eat it right
I'm not saying to promote my my item lah but then again I feel that this is good Roslan makan pun he can find energy ya
ya he took ah sarah eh dia kerja malam kan dalam pukul dua belas dia makan kan it can help him to survive until five baru rasa ngantuk
whatever lah I mean if you then then like that is personally lah from my own experience yang I'm having right now I can talk personally to people outside lah without putting it in my Facebook right
dia macam tak kasi aku apa macam maintain ah maintain maintain my weight so far lah aku dah cause dia kasi kita process kan kita punya toksin kan
I am I am anti weight machine punya orang I wouldn't even like want want to go up
babe my my auntie kurus nya pun diabetic before that also she like that sia also diabetic it doesn't matter is your the way you eat
but then again ya lah eh just now I cooked asparagus sedap seh that day I get a free asparagus I got asparagus I don't know from um a donation drive from my block
not lah Workers Party punya agaknya
oh wow your husband don't want you to be an influencer I mean I mean you know what when you do this kind of charitable work eh or you know like you make to save the earth save the frog save the animals you know that kind of thing save food you know I mean at the end of the day you're actually giving to um orang yang memerlukan the feeling of that to do this social work is very very apa orang kata ya it's very rewarding in fact it is
ya it takes two hands ah ya I mean but if you have a husband who is quite macam understanding that okay you're doing this for a good cause I mean he will let you go to do this it's good lah you know but I know that some people have different different perspectives of
marriage or you know how they want to control their partner lah or you can become the wanita lindung kaabah lindungan kaabah number three lah never mind lah redha redha
she will be in primary darjah dia baru darjah no darjah empat lah ah darjah it's primary four ya
kan so I don't I don't know ah it's very stress ah fikir kan ni semua
it is it is a must for me to change the school to Tampines cause it's better for her macam dia boleh rest after school cepat balik betul tak the Tampines north is very near to my house
so kalau dia dah balik sekolah dia terus boleh balik you know it's very tiring you primary school primary four abang will be in secondary school so by the time I think he will be home by what four four also now they all have extra extra activities after school right
mm mm mm so I really hope this is really stressing me up also stressing abang up abang doesn't look stressed but I look stressed he was like saying chill lah mak I can do it
tepuk eh tepuk
alright here we are today what's up talking via this audio recording dan juga di zoom recording err macam
kejap ah kau tahu kau punya audio recording apa ni ada there's another additional sounds
so aku tengok lah ada orang orang ni like there're influencers in itself so what happen is when aku tengok dia punya comments like those who especially supporting the the the winners
err apa president the vice president
um I mean people have their own perspective and opinion lah but I think for those who support with the current winner apparently kena kena kata orang kena trashed kena slammed
aku tak sangka that actually trump the previous candidate have a lot of supporters so every comment is like oh my god I can't believe this your statement I'm gonna unfollow you
ah itu kau boleh nampak different lah because
from that day onwards I'm sure si trump punya followers pun macam K I'm gonna unfollow you I'm not gonna support you but somehow they will reappear lah they just love to comments that's why I said there's a lot of them I'm like so surprised
and we just looking to apa ni um barang-barang yang kau boleh beli via Carousell
nak beli eh ya that's crazy man like
plan B lah but sometime good eh kalau kita orang sekarang kena berwawasan sikit
ah macam dia lah dia berwawasan kita kita suka dia punya macam cara dia very determined eh tak malu ah so this kind of people actually it's good for err business lah actually he will likely be more drivel and you can really sell you know
uh so I think the police is so good to sum everything out and and make sense on why this happen and he siasat dia punya prime suspect
ya jangan tidur jangan tidur
sabar sama sama so semalam aku knockout then I just bangun balik perasan it's really really damn good movie
ya so kalau korang ingat back in the days err maybe in nineties
kalau korang tengok the witchcraft or the craft there's four women
who in a college itself and no one can mess with them lah so siapa-siapa try to hurt them or try to be nasty with them you gonna get retribution but also there's consequences of doing whatever they're doing so
so yang dia mati tu eventually it's there's another plot twist lah all together we thought that because of the spell by the craft actually it's not ya
it's damn good plot twist of a witchcraft not so horror not really walaupun ada ada juga yang terperanjat
apa lagi ya
the nun definitely mata kau buka besar-besar ah
aku lagi cerita yang buat kau thrilled terperanjat untuk kau macam watch all the way yes of course
apa lagi satu eh
there's err conjuring annabelle ada kena mengena kan
oh geram
tu wah rembat tu get so emotional rich
so this man is like actually just killed his wife with the hell out dia punya err wife remarried so he's not happy go and killed both of them
I think in is not something new ah because before that dia ada tunjukkan eh err lot of accidents or orang gaduh eh gaduh all this
so this man doesn't let her off easily ah kan surrounded with dekat orang gaduh kan so the man stalking her wherever she go and do a lot more than that so there's a lot of suspense
and they just like couldn't understand it or something kadangkala macam tu tak make sense aku rasa marah sangat ni tapi memang orang macam begini like kata orang dah you are negative by itself so the banyak amarah yang belum unsolved it just like add on of the road rage thing
so he escalated the matter by killing by killing did he ah he killed he killed some of this lady punya
kau pakai earpiece
okay tak nampak ah sekali tak eh
eh kau cerita lah
siapa they met a guy kat reunion
mm mm kan gared gared is the ni mm
I think tu bukan secretary itu attorney also
just pasal dia like junior
to the ni the main err ni lah
so kesian
not bad though that's not bad at all the efforts are um a bit sceptical about it nanti bila tunggu lama sikit
pasal ah kita dah benchmark eh kita dah tengok movie banyak sangat
second mesti ada subtitles because I tend to tak tak I kita tengok macam like where's the subtitle yo and how am I going to understand these they speaking english with slangs and very thick accent ya
five minutes of the says is important so say wrong buat semua terkeliru eh kuat sangat lah kutuk trailer
what else that we do err today oh kita ordered nasi ambeng eh
ah nasi ambeng dia adalah dari sebuah kedai ni
err ya not bad lah err like fifty bucks for two to three pax and then like the entire dulang
uh huh paru sambal goreng
kalau sayur tu kurang least favourite bukan pasal tak suka sayur apa tapi dia tak berapa lembut
ah masak sayur jadi lembut sikit eh
what else did we did today err we'd like to cover ourself with a lot of selimut selimut
selimut bukan semut K in case kau tak dengar so siapa yang tak dengar ni selimut S E L I M U T
ya hujan
hujan pun later started
camera is sleeping and my husband like bedek lah ni bedek dia ni tak kelip mata tak buat apa-apa dia diam jer
but then aku tengok macam makin aku naik makin dia punya tank makin apa dia makin pendek
ya aku ingatlah towards sana lead to somewhere else but no I'm going actually if I didn't end it I'm gonna get myself eaten by the crocodile oh my god crazy you got my adventurous in another way ya
primary four kot that time chill lagi anak-anak kecil ya
anak-anak headache
apa maksud engkau dengan tak berapa takut dengan crocodile
dan kau cakap kalau dia jump macam mana ah jadi aku berwaspada
err aku
I would rather follow the makcik-makcik rombongan you know they just saw take pictures
we saw the makcik eh in the botanical garden
some rabak ah rabak gila ah
monkey mengamuk monyet mengamuk teruk bro
aku belum nampak or tahu satu but aku tahu member guna sepak slap on the face
ya monkey monyet but tu dia same monkey business monyet
ada aku suka yang kecil lah maybe the baby one are cute and friendly and and playful
selamat monyet tu kurang bijak ke tahap that dia tak buka water bottle tu dia tengok takde air dia campak kau balik
ah tapi actually masa dekat bridge tu ni monyet ni dia ada agenda aku dah nampak daripada mata dia
like you better shut dia macam fine lah you better shut up when we're not going to say anything I'm going to jump on her bag I say okay alright go ahead
yes eventually they jump there's err grab a bottle from you lepas aku cakap I tahu kenapa but yang that err he very sneaky and he just noise trying to communicate to me the moment he hop on your bag but he look at me again
aku macam okay bro yo no monkey business
and happily they keep proper padahal air takde air kosong
atau kau just
kurang ajar punya monyet eh
ah nak kasi kasi betul-betul lah
aiyo so crazy oh so now kita nak kena bawa kayu eh to frighten them ah
ah singapore ni monkey kayu jalan weh tak tak aku rasa ambil kayu dia campak kepada kau balik
oh ya man no kangaroo I got a close up of the baby because someone next to me managed to macam kasi makan
but I didn't get to touch just in case something else or the mother or the father don't like and then just hop on me mampus sia ya
so the kangaroo barely run away they don't really eat it whenever we offered there's there's the like uh we bought quite a bit ah tapi tak tak boleh banyak makan seh like we bought like two two or one eh I don't remember
get fed by us ah the the time ah and then ada kasi makanan dia apa so at the end kita kasi dengan
birds and ni kan the ducks
they them datang ah
that's definitely but my um in my thought is like kalau pasal kita balik like
because it was there usually it was there already but it's always nasib kalau kena tak kena but I think this is gonna go higher because they are
we all know COVID is not easy thing for those who kena
it's a bit contradicting because it really depending on the government punya you know command
how how do I put it this way like we know like work still goes on but on the same time macam
kau tahu benda ni dah badly affected and I think when we talk about ke apa kan
ya tapi aku rasa
I don't see that we are macam lagi banyak lagi banyak benda kena push in so macam
atau it's like home comfort and thing since everything is going online then just do online lah kan
ya there the other thing is your kerja jalan lah unless kau kena micromanaged by your own company ah so
ya man yo so kita ada dalam masa berapa ni lagi tiga belas minit eh lima belas minit ah
and those are not definitely feel macam ah you know I mean
that's not easy you know especially for a pengantin ah
where it's gonna be how it's gonna look like and you know having all the family friends is there and err ramai meriahkan wedding there's always the kids but now it's different it's gonna be very low-key kind of kau tahu macam kahwin senyap-senyap I felt that that's how it is lah
unless unless you no need to macam invite people dia macam immediate family kau nak totally buat kecil-kecil just make sure everything sah then done but if you still need numbers of people coming in and then
you expecting little thing you know then I think is not the time yet lah kalau kau betul wedding kau grand you have certain expectation altogether and better don't lah not the time yet
kalau korang just sebab ada mum is there then just go ahead lah
ya I think kalau cakap sah ni and dia pun ada the elderly lah
so pasal kalau keluar kan orang wear mask kan and and not everyone is like comfortable with it
because that's their main entertainment like kalau dulu kan kita keluar I think they always go out go where pasar geylang ah
ah little india or wherever a shopping mall ke or visiting the bazaar ke ah membawang kan
mengopi lah mengumpat lah whatever lah sekarang stuck at home what to do know besides on the phone then
okay cerita lama okay
aku nak tengok ni drama perempuan tiada dosa eh perempuan yang tidak berdosa right ya

and then and then they will macam err terbawa-bawa abeh that's it
ah abeh then the next day they are your enemy ya
yes because okay err before okay before kita continue dengan kau punya music err current music err you err current music are you listening to
we used to grow up with macam err punk rock right punk rock then the ska then there's reggae and what what not right
era tu kira that time ah kan that era so but um
what got err kira-kira while how did you get into err this like current music that you are listening to
ya because I like to ask questions kan ah macam tak ah but because err like that time err like I really enjoyed macam
the fact that you were on drums because you knew what you were doing that's the most important part about being a drummer you just have to know what you're doing yang penting
kau terror
yang penting kau terror eh
dan sekarang kau main guitar
huh iya ke
yang penting kita terror bro
guitars ya macam okay because susah datang ah like it's usually okay when the macam drummers they will stick to macam drums all the way like throughout their lives drum drum drum drum drum then um
but you it's like a different case you before err after you like um kind of macam give up playing drums you actually went into right
oh gitu ya I actually tried you know macam
um or like techno or err what what what genre do you mention earlier on tadi
ah okay okay despite I want to understand macam further err okay disc jockey when you say you mix one song to another song kan so which means you have two turntables correct
so what you are trying to achieve is kira macam kau nak make
err like err a track from scratch betul tak
okay so okay in in in bands punya kind of a point of view band eh it's like you want to have your own band instead of play you're having a band with err kira main cover ah gitu
betul tak ah
which is a bit ya leceh ah kan macam might as well we play err kita punya own originals so that is what you want to achieve in
ni lounge eh
eh kira macam during that time bila bila kau do all that kan macam
best tak
oh that explains kira guitar tu is mostly um bila kau dah like into dirty blues and stuff like that lah
um boleh ah boleh boleh cope
err sometimes susah susah nak err apa
mm susah nak
sekarang selalu lepas itu
mm rasa err pergi
pergi err untuk satu hari sahaja tak tak payah dua tiga hari kalau kalau banyak hari nanti
nanti penat nanti tak boleh dapat tak dapat buat kerja rumah err homework

uh kena ask question like uh
selalu selalu topic yang pasal ada banyak
itu lah
then kalau
kalau question banyak
pakai formula selalu
kena practise ah

okay like maybe first would be I want the bank account that will like refresh itself tau tak dia tak err like I don't need to put duit inside lah biar dia biar pakai jer refresh to the original amount so kalau macam gitu err I don't need like a lot of money I just have enough money but enough is good jadi like tak sombong gitu ah
top up ah top up tapi bukan kita yang top up ah
uh tak tahu siapa yang top up ah tapi terima kasih jer
nak kahwin oh tapi that's your first wish tu mesti mesti ada boyfriend dulu ah
terus suami eh takde boyfriend tapi now you got boyfriend right
tapi korang ada pernah macam uh fight ke apa ke
so far belum ah mm okay tapi sekarang kan
sekarang kan macam COVID kan so cannot really meet each other that much apa
oh but how frequently tu
but like for me I remember bila I was dating kan uh we meet everyday sebab sama sekolah apa so kita orang sekolah sama kerja sama in the weekends so hari-hari dah tengok sama punya muka so bila kahwin I also know that takkan jelak ah
tak serik ah tapi okay ah dah dah come on ah dah nak sepuluh tahun jadi kalau dah tak serik tak jelak tu should be fine lah kan
eh panggil dia apa makcik cik
apa-apa jer jumpa dia kat mana kat rumah dia
oh tapi dah it's like coincidence ke atau memang nak jumpa dia
bapa dia tak kasi untuk dia mak dia tak kasi dia keluar atau like atau tak kasi dia jumpa you
oh ya ya ya oh dia tak tahu
mak dia jer tahu ah
oh asal dia tak bilang
ya macam why he why he like want to like keep it secret seh
okay so do you guys like macam
if your oldest you usually will mix with the youngest then kalau like the youngest hang out with oldest middle child I don't know ah middle chair honestly I don't know
problem with that so far takde lah
bagus lah K wait so what's your what's your horoscope and zodiac like what are you guys
oh eh apa bara api tu scary juga tu nanti kalau like if one of you all like marah habis sia dua-dua volcano seh
so like your chinese one your you you're what ah tiger right ya tiger memang ah
macam a'ah bara api gitu tiger fierce
tapi belum belum belum apa apa apa so baru tiga bulan so you don't know lah like
cause for me and my husband kalau kita kita dah jumpa everyday monday to sunday
so we dated six months kita macam dah tahu each other gitu ah so we hardly like ever fight cause we kinda know before we
fight that okay I did something wrong then kita orang cakap ah kita mesti cakap ah like must communicate and talk ya
then for you guys dia sekarang sekolah right so he berapa tahun lagi eh
oh he's just a normal lah bukan honours lah
okay okay cause I think honours is like five years gitu
mm four years so dia macam
okay dia start dia belajar apa
gitu-gitu ah
oh first year already tak surviving oh rabak hancur seh
exam exam ah okay so dia sekarang end of the first year
if he pergi counselling the course counselling he might have to restart lah
three four more years with something you don't like kan lagi exams means you have to study for it
tu ah and he's still so young he's like what twenty five kan so so I feel like he still got a long way to go like doesn't really matter ah ya cause like in the end if you take this kind of degree then what if you have to pursue that kind of career then lagi rabak then his whole life will be electrical engineering which is like
I think macam dia kena fikir betul-betul lah kalau dia kalau dia nak continue ke atau dia nak
like tukar ke because like one year is still okay tapi bila dah two years gitu kan then I think that's when it's err there's more at stake because you're gonna waste about two years ya but first year still okay lah kalau nak tukar right ya and I think it's quite easy to actually switch switch like courses switch like your degree in the school
no no like in for example like kalau in in so actually kalau some people right they will uh come to the school to a course they don't want and then after that they spend one year there and they will switch to a different course a course that they want even though they weren't they didn't qualify at first sebab lagi senang but you waste one year lah but you get to go to the course you actually want ya
uh uh so like macam gitu pun boleh lah kalau if you want because a lot of people kat poly also they do that so like my friend they sometimes do that like it will just go in to like err some course that they don't like like engineering gitu then past one year in they get good results and then they try to muscle another like a different completely different diploma yang dorang nak and then after dorang masuk then they get to go ah so it for them is like um ya you you sacrifice one year ah to do what you want then so you can think of it like that gitu
okay so dia dah tapi dia electrical engineering before that
diploma okay so that means at least he has a diploma in game design and stuff asal dia tak pergi digipen
like I'll I'll go for the one that I think I cannot reach first then I'll try my hardest but then kalau tak boleh you know that you tried your best then you go to something that you feel that you can manage or you can handle ya because you know that at least you tried your best lah
I don't think there's a lot of choices creatively at least for ada tau art design on media that one at least ah there's some form of creative output but for I really don't know
ya so like macam my teacher in lasalle the one I'm doing degree that one that time [kan] she's actually teaching for that and then she ask us whether we want to pursue in masters in that topic I I didn't want lah so eh I mean I feel like
um I'm okay tapi I feel like I gone I got degree already so I want to at least do something about it I don't want to like
you think I'm like by the time I graduated I was already what twenty five ya so macam I felt like I needed to work or at least do something ah like not school for once gitu
ya pretty much even though like kat uni I I took a two year break to to like venture into like my like entrepreneur stuff tapi then I went back so ya then I think
you know do all that research and but after you work for awhile right um what I heard from my classmates ah yang dah dorang bekerja kan then dorang dah bekerja berapa tahun ah at the most sepuluh tahun gitu then dorang come back to like get just get a degree dorang betul-betul lupa macam mana nak belajar macam mana nak tulis like an essay like how to write essay all that dorang dah lupa
ya so um that was one of the reasons why I wanted to like just continue cause I scared that I will like lose the the hang of it gitu
ya then I'll forget how to write an essay and then uni in uni you need to write a thesis so it's like just words and words and words apa
berapa tahun eh berapa tahun
oh satu eh
so kalau you want to really go into uni like where when are you thinking
lepas kahwin betul-betul nak kahwin dulu eh
oh is there a reason why you want to like kahwin first
um in terms of stress kan lepas kahwin eh you'll get less stress about the things that you feel are very stressful for you cause like you know before I kahwin and then lepas tu like I felt very
um stressed out sebab like nak our our mum she ah she like makes all the decisions I have to respect her I've to respect the decision and ayah decision and it is very difficult because they sometimes they don't understand but now after I married I'm like my
the guardianship sort of is under my husband so he's more understanding and he's more like my way of thinking gitu so I feel definitely less stressed you know like I I
tapi takde apa-apa ah because ah kalau orang tanya pun I will just say oh my husband he's okay with apa so in the end religiously uh culturally it's okay ya that that's what I think ah so
kau siapa seh
so my suami is super like easy going dia faham everything I'm very honest to him
kalau I'm going to this place ke apa I'm going to overnight there I'll tell him lah I'm going to overnight kat tempat ni with my friends we just wanna chill kalau nak ikut ikut ah like like that's what I'm like with him so and that's what I'm like with that's why he's like with me also so kalau dia nak keluar ke apa with his friends I'm also okay like I think must have that kind of understanding lah so I don't have the stress and pressure that I had when I was under my parents
kahwin ya
ya betul lah
tu ah
then macam I feel like you're going to have to go through a wedding that you don't actually want
malangnya I think you want like my kind of wedding
ulam seh kampung kat mana ni kampung apa malaysia
pulau ubin dorang nak tutup apa
semakau pergi tekong tekong sudah pergi
kalau nak pergi kat malaysia kita masih ada saudara-saudara kat sana
ah tak rapat ah tapi ada lah ada tu ada lah
filter kau block yourself you block yourself you know
kau block sendiri but then the rental will be insane
ah betul lah uh then mm pulau ubin is actually quite interesting for a wedding
like like are they chinese ke malay ke oh
takde motor takde kereta ah bagus kau
dia jemput jer semua orang tapi actually tak jemput semua orang indirectly lah
orang agaknya yang keluarga yang dorang tak suka semua kat west kat east east so dorang pilih yang paling jauh sekali dorang pilih yang uh yang uh um uh kat tuas situ kat johor masuk masuk ah johor masuk tapi kalau kau orang uh tampines pasir ris tak payah datang sudah waste your time
so dorang kat sana kat mana dorang the majlis kat mana
is like you only go there kalau nak show off
kan like if you just want to show off cakap like you like you got a lot of money then okay lah sentosa lah but if not then why why there right there's so many other places in singapore yang you can actually get
pay for everyone's ferries still will save money gitu
uh tapi ada timer ah dah reach dah reach harbourfront okay habis wedding habis
uh uh uh unless if unless if like you ah ambil the cruise ship yang pergi batam and back ah then okay got time tapi ada cruise yang sekarang they just like just float float float around then come back you know they hardly go and anyway and then by the end of the day you you reach the place ya and which is harbourfront and back lah so kalau macam gitu susah sikit ah
and orang tak boleh datang like wherever they want they have to come bila bila cruise dia dah nak ship off gitu ah
a'ah ambil kapal sendiri kalau tak kau kau ambil lah sampan kau bawa sampan kau kelakar seh nanti dorang dayung sampan
alamak susahnya nak datang aku tempat ni ya allah
I think at night lah we should do that like in the day we can keep it like very civil very like you know then bila dah malam kan then we say oh uh all the makcik pergi tidur and stuff and then terus we got to the club and then terus
so you went with adik
buffet jer buffet lah buffet dia halal lah
oh chilli crab pun ada
if you have a staycation then we got like swimming pool and then we can like enjoy like we get the ones yang macam the one I went that time the intercontinental like intercontinental had like is the swimming pool and gym had like yoga room so like they we had a lot of places to go ah even if it's just the hotel alone ya so even when it was like um
ya so I tried one and it was so bad it was for the like hardcore people is super like is like eh is not even like espresso it's worse than espresso ya so rabak so I didn't even K I didn't even like
uh uh but okay lah it was fun lah it was for once you get to feel like macam orang kaya gitu uh tapi like ya that's it lah but I don't know lah like
kalau korang nak um pergi staycation ke tak
I know the kalau if the d'kranji here is
clean certified clean certified then maybe kita boleh pergi sana
cause there is like very secluded kan so it's a different experience gitu like out of city life
uh tapi I you still don't know what you want to spend right with your hundred
uh you and me will have this share the room and then he and abang hafiz will share lah
uh so kita halalkan lah
oh so susah tu but no if they like
uh uh a bit of conversation to starter someone who can start a conversation at least cause kalau if it's two hafizes I mean both tak boleh seh
uh uh so I think macam okay lah like we we can do that but it depends ah like cause I really want to like staycation but the thing is I don't know who wants to go and where we go things like that I'm like
I'm begging and like desperately wanting one like get away tu ah
mm january gitu okay
ya lah but I mean okay lah we can we can always go tapi the thing is like you said ah must plan lah ya
oh ya the one you told me yang dia
I mean dorang pun macam orang melayu lah you have to understand lah kita orang pun macam everything also macam relax apa
tak ikut sangat ah but
ya so I feel like macam
macam gitu it will be really susah for them to
and indonesia pun teruk teruk seh
like indonesia is teruk
kalau tengok dia punya cases
ah betul
indonesia is also like quite high death rate kan death percentage considering like when you compare it with everyone else gitu
so this is very scary ah like lagi dorang pun I don't think they care then they are so dense gitu the the country
ya ya ya like even for ours like we have all the preventive measures kan err then err but for them dorang tak ada pun I mean kita bila we needed the extra space terus kita pergi tukar expo lah tukar all the places that we already have tapi tak pakai apa because COVID kan so we use that place to um immediately make it a space for the COVID nineteen patients
tapi kalau indonesia I think susah because kan singapore kan kita kan asyik kiasu kan kita semua mesti buat cepat cepat cepat tapi kalau indonesia semua relax
dorang relax jer kita kan kiasu everything must be like a bit too much and then because of that it helps us also to be overly prepared but for indonesia I doubt that they are actually prepared because
mm uh dorang pun macam kalau mati mati lah dah sakit that's their thinking ah dah sakit apa sakit so kalau mati sakit apa nak jadi
so dorang tak macam fikir macam betul-betul gitu ah dorang tak fikir masak-masak macam kenapa macam mana boleh uh manage kan all these things ah so it's very hard for them ah like india also is very very very bad
ya ya ya yang teruknya kan a lot of the old people are dying and there's this like thinking saying like a rumour ah saying that it's
a'ah but like I feel like it's somewhat true because dorang really tak kesah for the for the old people
ah then like dorang macam they will only like take in like patients yang have a chance of survival
that's that's how bad their their condition is it's like dulu punya america
ya during um last time when america was quite bad kan I mean now it's still bad but last time when it was really really bad they also had to had made the kind of decision like who has a better rate of survival then they will help that person so macam kesian ah but in india it's like that every day now
ya I I feel like ya but I mean the government can do much more tapi they don't so there must be a reason why why they're doing it like you know
ya I mean even singapore we are an ageing population but we don't do that kita cakap lepas tu kita bilang uh yang orang-orang tua jangan keluar jangan like
don't mess lah don't mess with other don't go meet with other people all that tu kan
ya tapi orang-orang tua dorang kan uh tak nak memang tak nak dorang sendiri tak nak tu dorang punya pasal lah kan kita orang dah cakap pakai mask and jangan uh jangan keluar-keluar banyak sangat tapi dorang kan kalau nak keluar keluar lah apa nak jadi
because they are older right so we have to respect them so even if we don't want to ya so macam um there was this atuk not atuk ah pek in the bus and he wasn't wearing mask you know and he was coughing and everyone was just like oh no but we can't say anything to him so we were just like
like we will just like huh like what what are we supposed to do you know ah but like kita tak boleh buat apa-apa cause he's just like he is obviously looks like he doesn't wanna talk to anyone he doesn't want anyone to approach him about it also so I'm like okay
orang tak suka pakai mask and they will like meet up you know like they will meet up in the void deck so a couple of
ah pek together kadang-kadang more than five people and then they will like they will just talk talk talk macam biasa lah macam tak ada COVID gitu tapi kita orang tak boleh buat apa-apa kita orang just biarkan jer ah
correct the security guard I think trying to find something to do lah dia dah dia dah like bored lah I think
ya that's why some some guards are like like they really got nothing better to do some guards cannot be bothered like you know the are some like those like people like sitting there dorang tak tengok pun tau kalau kalau kau scan ke kau tak scan ke dorang just masuk dia kasi masuk jer dorang tak kesah kan ya so it's like it's so like uh jarring you know sometimes ya but I feel like at least okay lah singapore got like precautions to keep everything like safe you know like safe and stuff like that because if not ah I think it will be bad because we are so dense we are such a dense so densely populated like island ya like
um but because everyone has to wear mask so tak tak boleh buat apa-apa so it's that's why tak ada macam transmission not so much of transmission ah ya
to go out or go to see the doctor when you go see the doctor don't take bus take the take the private take Grab or something like that kan so err it's it's like already in our we already know you know like um the social way to like macam social responsibility lah ya ya like so like we are now it's like like second nature already cause dah berapa lama seh dah berapa bulan going to one year I feel
quite surprised that we had to spend a whole year or twenty twenty in a pandemic but it's not as bad as what I thought it was going to be luckily because we're here sebab kan kalau kalau negara lain negeri lain is like wow betul-betul rabak like but kat singapore they handled it quite well especially for the foreign worker punya time that time bila dorang hari-hari berapa ratus seh ya
with soap like dulu kan siapa nak cuci tangan dengan soap I ask you like tak ada seh all the aunty ah wash hand only wash water can already lah dorang memang mesti tak pakai soap punya mana ada pakai soap seh
now now they don't now they're like ah ya kalau tak wash nanti eh you never wash you never like use the soap ah then lepas tu baru dorang
you you really pakai the soap ya
good things comes of it uh come out from it lah ya ya ya betul lah like I think it's um inevitable lah like we have to learn it the hard way also ya but because of that we are much cleaner society like you know our toilets are cleaner
so the toilets are generally cleaner ah so like okay ah it's not bad ah um mean at least now we are not like confine you know lockdown kan and know france kan dah second lockdown
ya rather than macam kat sweden where it's like free and easy and then wow the death rates are like crazy seh
the there's a lot more cases actually then now it's quite bad kat japan lah so dorang kena mula balik ah everything lah have to go back the mask and all that err I mean for mask I think they're okay ya but social distancing all that stuff lah ya I think everywhere is still quite bad eh but not only some of the other countries some very very few countries that are having it controlled even for us we had that one of the guy at seoul garden kan kesian seh
tapi for me I kesian dia dia macam aku nak makan kat seoul garden sekali dengan kawan-kawan keluarga-keluarga aku terus terkena tu ah tu ah macam kesian seh ah nasib baik dia pergi doctor
ah naisb baik dia pergi doctor then lepas tu you know it can be people can get detected and stuff so it's it's still not so bad ya and is only one guy right for that day only one guy but he had a big group ya ah tu ah so
I mean I think kesian ah macam he got more hate than
what he should have gotten gitu ya
no dorang three tables uh
so there were still like macam bergroup tapi err it was distance distance three distance tables but I think they got mix around lah macam kadang-kadang dorang mix like you sit here I sit there ke apa mix food err so maybe have that kind of thing ya so there's the um the fear that they have lah
ya so kesian ah
and dia dia sakit kan dia pergi doctor then bila dah kena COVID and the check up oh at least I was with twelve other people
even though we actually followed lah the rules and stuff kat sini seoul garden ah if me I think I wouldn't say so much seh I diam diam jer tak lah but like I feel like macam why get myself into more trouble than than what I have already kan ya so I feel like um he's actually good part ah for him to be really responsible also
ya exactly cause it's like we're trying to get back to norm and then you know the japanese he's he actually recommended err people to wear mask even when we're eating I don't know when we're eating or drinking then I'm like I saw the headline then I was like apa seh
like what the hell does that even mean gitu uh uh so I I was like wow this prime minister really wants to like err reduce the number of COVID but I have no idea how he plans to do that
uh uh I think it was like you know you like open a bit from the bottom then you makan then I'm like but it's so like
how then I'm like I don't know like that's it's ridiculous but he said it in national so err ya macam gitu like I don't even I I I don't know how he's going to do it don't know how the japanese people are gonna do it ah bagus ah dorang habis ah a'ah tu ah like macam it's
ya ya ya he's just like ah give up lah dah mengaku kalah
ya they are do trying to do that they have a lot of small initiative to macam err cheer up the community gitu um it doesn't evade the fact that they're going through a difficult time lah
so one person talk then one person answer K okay so topic permulaan
okay I don't know what happen I was at home tengah keluar masuk bilik cari makanan as usual cari air then suddenly mama on the sofa scrolling her Facebook and then she say the kranji resort ni macam cantik let's all go stay for holiday gitu ah satu three day two night something like that
no she just ask like korang nak pergi farm stay tak I initially said no because it's at kranji and I always told her like nanti sana ada momok
I think so ya dia dekat dengan sungei buloh all the way sia I check on Google
actually I solve that problem already like yesterday um I went to research more lah like the the reviews of this place so I saw on tripadvisor that they spend like three hundred and eighty five dollars for one villa for one night it was very expensive and they said the place is so rundown abeh macam tak ada makanan and stuff like that ah
then there was another review I showed mama that this family had to spend like close to six hundred dollars because there was no food there so they have to go out and buy the barbecue nya barang barbecue over there so ya the review was like all one star one star one star those were pretty recent like ya yesterday it was seventeen eighteen november kan the review was on sixteen november just two days before
huh sekarang hotel tengah macam staycation package gitu kan
baru keluar eh ah later I go check
I ask mama what about snow city because it's the nearest to our house and we have never been there before so might as well pergi sana mama kata tak pernah nampak snow that time she went to bugger she just saw like one to three ah sikit gitu jer
yes it was a son of a peach then lepas tu I share with mama then mama was like eh tu dekat dengan apa rumahnya mak punya rumah kan tu is it the new house is it
tu mama dah start dia punya
oh yang block one two eight eh
boleh lah dah terlanjur
wow was this like during the time of the makcik keropok yang datang rumah abeh orang semua macam
oh no makcik keropok was much later I think was in that time
makcik keropok has been going around for quite long ah I don't know when we moved to our house dekat clementi kan think I was in uni that time then there was this bibik indonesian who tengah jual keropok and then it was I think malam lah macam lapan lepas maghrib bibik tu ketuk pintu abeh tanya nak jual keropok
then mama tengah kat living room I open the door mama straight away jump up and then she started screaming like adik adik then the bibik kasihan tau the bibik was like saya bukan hantu saya bukan hantu saya betul-betul benar-benar mahu jual keropok gitu
then I was like I alamak mak aku tak baik seh dia terus panic gabrah depan depan bibik tu but I ended up buying a few keropok lah cause kasihan
ee bacin
lepas renovation hopefully dah okay lah tapi nak kena hack balik ah takut pijat-pijat bau takpe bau will go away but it's the pijat that maybe can come back
kat dalam-dalam ah
like really people who really don't know how to take care of their things actually like time beli rumah time tengok-tengok rumah your parents didn't know they have twenty cats inside the room
mm agaknya eh
tengah renovation ke
alamak okay lah tak lah nanti kalau kita bebual nanti tak dengar sangat
I tried linkedin I tried um my careers future which is tak bagus tak guna punya
or like macam singtel you know government related jobs ya and then um the the the macam amount of jobs kat situ tak banyak sangat lah kat my career future so I tried also the other one which is job street lah job street has the most but job street is mostly recruit recruiters ah or even if they have job like macam they call me back dia punya job dekat east side dekat loyang because I do supply chain mah so a bit too far for me lah
tak ada the good thing is like macam I attended all these itu job fairs and all these job fairs err there will be someone who will call me back and ask me if um anything positive come out of the the the job fair macam ada interview ke tak then I will just let them know that ada ke tak which I will always say none I attended follow back with me follow up with me on any interviews or what then they said okay never mind will still continue to search for you
eh tak tahu I will try
okay lah sekarang job market macam gitu so I'm just waiting for twenty twenty one ah for things to be better
itu jer so sad
oh so now he's only the only one stuck there but his family dah balik sini lah
sana tak ada macam like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
okay question what are your thoughts about the changi punya restaurant a three eighty thing where you pay money to eat the first class food in the airplane
when the news came out she ask me adik do you want to go and eat at the airport the aeroplane there the first class mama nak try makan first class tak pernah duduk alah tak boleh fly kan duduk kat dalam aeroplane dapat makan pun jadi lah gitu so I told mama for the price that you pay ah I would rather save up the money and actually fly first class to somewhere than just sit there and eat
I remember like I I did say that out um mama did say that she want me to macam take them go jalan-jalan lain kali daya bawa pula lah because like the last time she went japan macam korang bawa dia kan so she said to me lain kali daya bawa lah kita jalan-jalan so I told mama
cara I jalan-jalan later you all don't like one good thing is I very relax so some days you can don't go out if you are tired but another good thing is I like to backpack and all these things stay in dorm you all must hotel then how ya
but penat seh masa tu kita pergi japan banyak jalan so I don't think they would want to cook also I also don't want to cook the japan food very nice
sedap but the sedap is what the cook is malaysian cook ah or japanese cook
I never try nasi lemak on airplane before
things to note nak kena try nasi lemak kat silk air important question nak fly tu bila tu aiya I hope they can find a cure for this COVID seh
betul punya travel bubble eh from one island to another island
oh ya a'ah orang semua nak balik negeri
dah relax dah kan
oh dah thirty minutes already
a'ah still a lot of things juga
eh then they hack it out then outside is what kosong jer oh
ya then I have to think about K sale of balance cause sale of balance usually macam reject reject punya kalau orang tak suka the areas ah the units ah
ah atas tong sampah gitu ah ada orang tak suka tempat tong sampah atau rumah punya fengshui tak bagus ke yang at least the good thing is tak ada momok ah kalau resale kan
yang tengah yang tengah have lah tengah have
ya actually ya I would so I was thinking of that also macam cause I saw like
on property property ninety nine I think ninety nine dot com the app tu kan so people who live in like edgefield plains kat kawasan sengkang they are pretty new and they were selling the house although house is quite cheap the house is actually still in good condition ya ah macam kau masuk terus dah siap
I want like macam cement floor macam gini kan macam cement floor
it look like macam cement gitu like concrete gitu
so I was thinking of something like this lah macam yang penting colour grey bawah tu look a bit like cement
korang ada skirting tak kita letak skirting juga lah
because I was thinking that kalau if I move out to my own place I think I need to bring pluto along with me I told about mama papa I don't want to live alone so I confirm nanti bawa pluto sekali lah so I also think about oh if you want to have a house nanti pluto need her own cat tree lah you need to catify the house semua kan
so that's why I'm like thinking about what I want to do to the house and how much I must save there are people who spend like eighty thousand dollars on renovation abeh rumah dia macam minimalist gitu and it's eighty thousand dollars
cause I I don't want to like macam have a lot of build in I was thinking of just by IKEA furniture
ye lah si kecil tu dekat rumah cekau-cekau jer now the kayu-kayu semua nak terkopek so that's why I'm thinking like that ah tak payah lah beli mahal-mahal beli macam murah kayu simple simple then IKEA kan macam batau furniture then after five years can throw already
they katuk very fast eh
a lot of macam renovation company mcam dorang katuk very fast
oi kejapnya dah rosak
hood jatuh
oh ah reno talk bagus ya ya
I was actually looking at counter tops semalam cause I had berangan nak okay nak macam kayu punya butcher countertop pastu kan cement floor gini kan and then dia punya ah tempat cabinet dia colour putih gitu so I was thinking oh very nice colour putih macam a bit rustic sikit butcher block then sekali when I read about the butcher block is literally just a chopping board so nak kena letak mineral oil semua nak kena maintain tu yang leceh
oh macam boleh buat back splash terus gitu eh
wow tak pernah dengar ni vulcan
nak kena wax tak atau sealing ke apa
entah she tak mention apa she just said that ah nanti kalau singgah sheng siong bilang eh
betul but I'm not going to go sheng siong I'm going to go daiso but I don't know I think jcube got one daiso
padahal dekat but still uh need to walk further
choa chu kang nya dah siap
COVID happened kau nak kena bagi chance dekat dorang
but it's near to mama and papa so when I'm malas to cook I can just walk over
ah mama actually said that she say kau jangan pergi dekat tu sengkang jauh-jauh ni kau dekat-dekat jer dari lah dekat clementi resale pun tak apa
buruk-buruk one
ah then dah buat ni semua aiya tak payah pindah
ya lah tak payah pindah stay there for what at most also you just need to renovate the room that taufik has been using to keep his things did you see the canvas I saw a lot of like shoes they use the small rooms they change it to like a home office with like a see through glass it's very nice
true lah singapore susah nak cari yang perfect perfect
a'ah seh kasihan your neighbour only got one plant and then korang letak banyak-banyak
pokok hang dia satu jer tanam lah pokok-pokok hang banyak sikit
actually good lah the jiran that's okay tu pun susah nak dapat
oh dorang alternate kan
try teaching ah macam mana nak teaching I like teaching I don't like you heard that I like teaching I don't like
oh okay okay okay faham faham
that's why I really macam tabik ah those people who go teaching cause you you don't even have time to teach you spend more time on benda-benda remeh-remeh semua layankan parent layankan principal
kindergarten no I got no patience with yang kecil-kecil yang masih berak dalam seluar
yang kat luar tu semua habis ah pecah-pecah
eh bijak eh dia bijak
tu lah kalau anak saudara sendiri okay tapi kalau jaga anak orang lain like in a school setting is different the kids have different values they come from different backgrounds kalau anak saudara at least the values are still similar you know kalau budak tu ada problem can always easy for you to speak to the parents
dah hafal script ah gitu
for me tuition was different okay like macam I know that the syllabus are ajar macam gini kan but with each kid they are at different at how should I say different macam not say education level like macam tahap kefahaman dorang is different so macam maybe in class the teacher already dah start on algebra but the kids punya foundation is still very weak so although dorang dah sec one and they are already doing algebra their understanding of maths is still macam at primary four primary five ya so
is a bit interesting lah for me like every single student is like a project different materials different way of teaching ah ada budak macam they really need ah physical experiment to really understand mathematical concept I mean as adults right when we look at maths we think macam is very straightforward one plus one equals to two but to a kid who has no understanding of what is maths at all kan
they will be like apa tu one kenapa one kenapa one plus one kenapa tak boleh one and that kind of thing
actually it's not that hard I realise okay lah because for me um I teach budget tuition and I teach orang kita orang kita mak-mak dorang macam more or less macam ah relax jer kau datang class kan dia kasi epok-epok lah dia sibuk kasi kau makan dulu for them is I just want you to sit next to my kid and make sure my kid does his work
tu dorang punya um general generally lah most of them dorang punya mindset is like that there are a few macam one or two who come and they say like oh I want my kids to get A padahal the kid is already a B student so for me macam when I come in actually there's not so much work on my part it's just that I want the kid to be interested in learning once the kid dah interested in learning automatic terus dorang A sendiri so jadi tak stress macam gitu
yang stress is when you haven't start the parent macam ah kepoh kepoh lah like you can you go through this for my kid can you look can you go through that for my kid ah macam gitu tu leceh sikit
ajar budak-budak madrasah ah madrasah kids were very very nice
but I feel so sad for them because when they share with me the school punya how the school life is right then I realise the quality of education is very different ya I had one like this student everytime I read it so one year is one older than the other take three the other one take two
so he was sharing that their maths teacher is the same teacher I think science teacher was the same teacher the teacher is like some makcik like very old lady who in the class will just sit down and talk talk talk talk talk talk so they don't understand what's going on in the lesson
I because madrasah under private school kan
okay what al al-irsyad ah eh but al-irsyad susah nak masuk eh
sekolah tahfiz ah
eh but it's good you know because like I see like a lot of people who graduate from madrasah like oh my god they have like masters and double masters because nineteen subject for O levels is nothing you know they are doing two masters at university level is nothing is a longer route for them but even at thirty years old they're still doing like all these ya this is like nothing for them
okay mah tak salah pe but I notice this trend tau macam my friends who are in education or their wife who are in education wah they really start planning the education route early on baby masih dalam perut dah planning tau nak hantar childcare ni lepas umur ni pergi this school nanti pastu hantar ni
macam we all orang biasa relax ah pergi sekolah good enough already ah
as an adult I wanted to be a farmer I apply kat kok fah kena reject seh sedih
okay hari ini I went to bath and body works
I went to apa itu to err the dia punya outlet dekat takashimaya sebab I nak beli dia punya err scented candle
ya black friday hari ini
but it's very it's a very it's I'm very disappointed lah because dia punya sale kan
patutnya hari ini banyak um barang-barang kan tapi like semua macam sudah run out macam like the day before dia orang dia orang had a sale
tak best ah tahun ini tak best
you know I went to three one three then after that err tengok-tengok baju tapi so macam they say the price is lowered tapi macam it's still expensive you know
ya semua tempat pergi semua crowded
ya really and then tak payah keluar tak payah queue semua
just now um I was lucky lah because I thought they had this early bird sale and everything then I tunggu pukul sembilan pagi all the way till eleven plus masih belum buka
tak macam dia punya sale on black friday kan macam kaw kaw usually it's kaw kaw but this year macam it's so mellowed down
ya then like um malaysia punya lagi kaw dia orang punya black friday tapi I heard from my cousin dia orang punya black friday like no black friday
ya economy so bad already malaysia kasihan
same sudah lah murah
no not thai odyssey apa nama dia err no another one healthland
worth it sangat and then like kalau you pergi yang punya there are few outlets lah tapi the best one right you find the biggest outlet itu yang paling best
dia bukan spa it's totally all full thai massage
I pun tak ingat hundred and twenty minutes I sudah lama tak pergi nak dekat how many close to a year tak pergi
ya sedih ah
the pasar tani
ya no not normal pasar tau pasar tani
bukan pasar malam dia macam pasar pagi tapi tani lah like macam-macam lah you get like err avocado smoothie lah
then after that pineapple juice lah macam-macam ah I like
oh ah ah ya ya ya queue dia selalu panjang kan
then like kalau I masuk malaysia kan I selalu datang pagi like very very early then dia punya crowd tak sangat macam teruk sangat lah still manageable
kalau ya
ah ada lah
tak shops belum buka sebab I straightaway pergi pasar tani so I sudah sampai situ kan by the time I reach situ sudah six plus
then six plus tunggu kat pasar tani itu err I think about fifteen twenty minutes until dia punya set up semua sudah start then we go in ah
oh my favourite is avocado juice memang sedap
no um I also tak suka sayur tapi macam dia punya avocado juice is like the indonesian style dia macam campur gula melaka semua
ya it's nice dia manis yes
ya can memang sedap
yang dekat singapore punya you can try indonesian restaurants yang dekat I'm sure indonesian restaurant anywhere in singapore ada dia nama jus alpukat
ya tapi memang sedap if I have to choose a favourite drink that would be my favourite drink I really love avocado juice
tak ah I don't really like fruit fruit juice tapi like I don't know ah avocado is just an exception
malaysia yes I selalu pergi situ like staycation with my family over there tapi kalau staycation dekat singapore memang tak lah
ya and then might as well you duduk dekat rumah kan your own home
ya itu lah
yes is enough memang cukup uh sedih merana
I was like okay basically right I kalau tak pergi massage sudah berapa bulan kan my back will hurt so much
so I jenis macam how to say I'm very picky with my massage massage punya tempat tau I don't like indonesian style massage it's very painful
always yes tapi thai massage dekat singapore semua macam so expensive
ada eh
wah nak try ah
sebab indonesian punya uh style kan javanese style punya ya allah I bentan urat the urat the next day my whole body ache like mad kadang-kadang tak boleh bangun pun
yes it's very bad but ya but for thai massage kan I macam the next day more more active and boleh buat macam-macam
um I try both dua-dua I suka
I prefer the traditional one sebab dia dia push your body macam macam way then bunyi ketap-ketup wah
ya sedap
tapi you kena pergi yang macam err healthland lah that one professional and thai odyssey lah tapi jangan pergi yang um tepi-tepi jalan punya that one a bit scary ah
ah ah kaki
kan sedap
sudah habis ya me also
itu lah
err boleh cakap pasal err apa eh nama dia makanan favourite ke
oh pedas type sudah try mala
msla sedap
oh plain then you should try apa itu green curry
should try sedap sangat sedap
it's creamy and then after that dia ada macam a bit pedas-pedas then got manis like all the flavours ada lah in one
I tak tahu
oh oh yang tingkat bawah itu eh
lah I always thought itu tak halal so I always buy the drink sahaja aduh yes now I know oh my favourite thai green err thai my favourite thai drink is thai green milk tea
oh carnation tahu dia orang pakai
no haven't sedap ke
I always eat at this macam err outlet dekat mana eh dekat far east plaza I don't know if you know
huh uh dia tingkat bawah I don't know if you know cahaya cahaya tingkat atas tapi yang thai food ini all the way tingkat bawah dekat belakang
huh uh dia tingkat yang sama macam yang korean supermarket itu
ya authentic thai tapi halal
yes I'm more of a cahaya fan tak tahu kenapa
preference ya err what I like from cahaya is the apa eh mushroom dried noodles itu mm sedap
oh sedapnya
ya I also aduh then dia punya wanton pun sedap but I haven't tried I haven't tried puncak one
why sedap eh
ya sebelah sebelah jer kan ya but then you also should try the downstairs one the thai food memang sedap
chey macam promoting dia punya tom yum I tak pernah rasa tapi I pernah rasa dia punya green curry dengan dia punya err pineapple fried rice these those are my favourite
okay I remember the sebab dia ada dua kedai thai err one is called nana
and then nana you just walk straight turn left sebelah dia sudah it's literally beside it it is called something something thai food
this kita hari kecil saja
oh kalau you datang pukul sebelas atau pukul dua belas memang ramai orang tak ada tempat duduk
so I suggest ya weekdays I suggest you datang pukul sepuluh and below lah
I think not so crowded tapi pukul sebelas I can guarantee you banyak orang
ya ya and it's like cheap affordable and memang sedap
cartoon network I suka tengok err apa itu masa zaman I kecil-kecil lah I like to watch scooby doo
then err captain caveman and apa eh road runner
err ya I love these three last time right masa I kecil-kecil pukul err lima pagi I macam ada schedule tau at five right I will watch captain caveman then after that scooby doo and then after that in the day I will watch road runner
stop watching it right ya me also ya same tapi right my love for scooby doo right is still there somehow
dia macam how to say ah dia sudah macam cari hantu
you know like dia macam cerita budak-budak kan jadi dia punya hantu semua merepek-meraban tak tak macam hantu betul
so like and then like you will try to figure out who is the culprit and everything dia macam put thinking skills in you tau
so like you fikir siapa agaknya culprit ini oh bukan ini then after that turns out it's orang ini so like that kind of thinking skills so that so that's the type I like lah
ya it's all ya dia orang acah-acah macam hantu
it's very funny then like I suka sangat scoody doo sampai beli dia punya err apa itu plush toy
no lah dia anjing apa scooby doo anjing so okay lah I just have it like for fun because it's like memory my favourite cartoon I'll have one lah
yang piglet itu ke
yay you know like masa I dekat indonesia indonesia kan macam tak banyak cartoon kan
so like at like in the middle of the night I suka buka so like in the middle of the night dia orang boleh main shaun the sheep ya and then I watch till the next morning then my mum macam bangun like eh you haven't sleep no I watch shaun the sheep the whole night night ya then that is how I like shaun the sheep is very funny
dia kejap eh hmm I think it was in indonesian
ya dia macam voice over gitu
ya I also pelik
ya ah ya ya dia punya mouth memang tak in sync and it's not satisfying
ya ya ya betul betul
then right you always go malaysia right you pernah nampak cartoon ini nama larva tak
dia larva bukan volcano tahu dia larva is err macam ulat
dekat mana I tak tahu location dia tapi I tahu dia punya mall nama capital
ya tapi dia punya tingkat atas is just an indoor theme park for the kids then dekat bawah semua normal shopping mall
boring tapi larva itu memang funny
okay I don't like but my mum seems to like it which is so pelik ya very pelik my favourite is oggy and the cockroaches
oh ya I mean I also geli dengan cockroaches but after watching that show kan macam I pandang cockroach macam it's the oggy the cockroaches ya ya then I outgrew that fear of cockroach already so ya cause I find them funny
yes ya tapi tapi kan I have a phobia for spiders
I tak boleh spiders I will see if the spider is like one meter away I will scream I just cannot see spider
ya I just cannot phobia sangat because what happened was last time when I was kecil kan err I don't know whether is it dream or it actually happened but I was inside a car then after that the whole car dalam interior of the car is filled with spiders
ya ya I don't know whether is it a nightmare or real because that happened when I was a kid so after that terus I phobia
I tak boleh tengok spider
aiyo I can feel you alamak kalau I pun phobia
aduh aduh kalau I pun phobia seh
ya and then like what triggers it more is that my parents left me sebab dia orang nak pergi beli barang sekejap
ya then my parents found me crying macam orang gila
err but I really don't know whether it actually happen or is it a bad dream itu saja
my parents cakap they never leave me in the car before itu yang pelik
sampai I boleh phobia macam ini
ya until now that time err masa I kecil I pergi school camp pun sama
bukan ada spider we literally set our err khemah on a grass a grassland filled with macam spider tanah
ya spiders tapi dia orang on the tanah so like malam-malam I felt something on me I nampak spider I menjerit I literally went hysterical
ya then I ran I ran to the err guard posts semua then after that it took me berapa jam ah to calm down can you imagine you phobia then you nampak that thing on you
phobia ya ya on top of it you know then bila ya exactly then bila um I pekik itu kan can you imagine I pekik pukul dua pagi everyone bangun then everyone nampak yang dia punya tent is infested with spiders
so can you imagine the kecoh
I I tak kisah I campak semua barang I ada kipas dekat situ I campak kipas I campak lamp post anything over there I campak I just ran masuk toilet and I literally drenched myself with water
then after that I keluar I lari pergi dia punya teacher's post
they calm me down dia orang kasih apa dia orang kasih makan milo semua then after that err sudah reda dia orang cakap eh what happen to you boleh tanya lagi what happen to me aduh then after that I explain lah then dia orang cakap oh patut lah kau hysterical yang lain semua okay sudah dia orang sudah move tempat lain sudah I saja yang hysterical sebab mmhmm spiders ya
cause I find like big bang punya new music is like different tau now dia orang sudah disbanded kan jadi macam sedih ah
ya I listen to those two band sekarang kan banyak orang suka right
but sorry to say lah I tak suka dia orang
I I kalau cakap I tak suka kan kawan I semua kutuk I jadi I say ah ya I like their music
ya sudah tua bangka pun suka K pop
aduh dia orang have a pop up store dekat singapore tahu dekat plaza sing
I pun tak ambil
ya now I never listen to shinee shinee I used to call it shinee you know shinee shiny see sampai sekarang dia bawa bawa
shinee aduh so like last time masa I kecil kan I obsessed sangat dengan big bang um so my file every page of my file kind of the film kind
thin film I akan tulis quotes from big bang
ya bedsheet pun big bang bantal pun big bang
ya I memang crazy about big bang dulu
ya I think so dia punya story very pelik lah dia punya story it involves almost everyone that you didn't expect
ya macam gitu kan like uh I tak sangka I was really shocked
ya sedih duh I was like genuinely sad when I heard that he's out of big bang like wah I grew up with them tau
tapi if you follow him on instagram sekarang kan dia macam a bit siao ting tong ah
uh huh tak percaya you tengok instagram dia
macam siao ting tong serious
itu satu and um dia macam artsy fartsy actually I don't know whether he's like the sudah gila ke err dia memang buat-buat macam gila because dia punya post pun macam pelik-pelik
I don't know how to explain to you tapi post dia memang pelik semua
right pelik kan
macam sudah a bit off
err bedsheet pun ada
then tahun lepas I pergi err dia punya making of the studio
dia punya official set punya tempat
okay um depends lah kalau you fan memang lah it's your heaven there tapi kalau you tak suka harry potter then don't waste your money there
tapi dia punya set ya allah besarnya
dia it's so big then I think it took us like four hours to finish the whole thing
ya ya ya then sudah lah jauh daripada london so basically we empat jam over there and then after that one hour pergi one hour balik
tapi it's best kalau you nak pergi kan you ambil set lah so there is a bus hantar you bus ambil you
macam mana nak kira duh
I pernah pergi
okay okay I tak nak boast lah
most I haven't gone to err eastern europe yet macam prague itu semua belum pergi
no I I have never been to myanmar tapi I um my grandma is burmese
my grandpa sudah sudah pass away sudah
it's like um I decided not to learn burmese but memang susah
uh huh very mixed lah this family ya best lah I mean dia macam ya lah tapi like my my mum malay lah of course but my grandmother dia kahwin dengan melayu
ya my atuk is good looking not boasting tapi when I look at him memang wah any woman akan suka dengan dia at that time
then after that dapat my mum so malay lah I
ya melayu melayu lah melayu boleh
eh tak ada lah
okay ah oh but walaupun um ada sedikit campur err dia punya err darah kan tapi I hold very strongly to uh hang tuah
dengan P ramlee
dia rumah betul dia tapi they convert to museum
ya then um for hang tuah I memang suka history and everything macam gitu lah
so ya I pergi perigi hang tuah
ya perigi hang tuah
oh because dia macam dia bukan attraction to public tahu jadi macam orang-orang yang macam singaporean yang biasa yang tak suka history dia orang tak akan tahu tempat itu kalau dia orang tak buat research
so like macam I memang suka like zaman-zaman dulu punya history kan so I like dig out lah then after that I felt oh hang tuah ah I should go
um the I don't know if you know the puteri gunung ledang
puteri gunung ledang is also another story
oh baru add eh
ya who doesn't watch bujang lapuk
but ya lah fun lah but I ini suka discover about all this malay malay punya history kan so I literally baca pasal puteri gunung ledang and I'm already intrigued
err I pergi library satu thing satu pasal then the other one is internet lor
okay reading itu depends on um what book it is
ah ah kalau you give me roald roald dahl is it called roald dahl
I tak akan baca
best ke
oh that one notebook punya orang kan
ya ya they were just jealous jealous sikit aduh ya that's why ya yay I found find a friends fan okay so basically kan um I boleh bangun nowadays ah I boleh bangun pukul lima and then I'll be like okay I'm bored I'm going to watch friends really
ya oh my god same you feel me yay err then masa I pergi itu kan I happened to go to primark primark suka ada macam themed err themed christmas style so they will sell all the themed punya barang-barang lah so I pergi to this err one of the primarks lah then I saw a friends collection
pullover ya macam jacket tak ada zip
ya ya ya memang cosy gila
kalau I kan I tak nak branded you just give me primark and I will be happy for life
sebab they have themed
they have themed accessories itu one thing the other thing is that it's murah
um of course lah there is a different sikit lah tapi dia macam tak melampau macam other other kind of brands lah
and it's still worth it because you tak akan jumpa primark dekat singapore
sudah lama pakai pun masih okay
you pernah tengok yang um monkey tak
I suka tengok
ya ya ya that one mantis sembahyang solat mantis
uh apa eh aku pun sudah lupa
aku sudah cakap solat mantis tengok lah ketawakan orang
mm kejap eh
I'm just gonna leave it as solat mantis
tapi yang paling kelakar is like when they interview the body parts punya ini apa ini apa aduh
ya dekat tampines
ya dekat tampines sister aduh
dekat tampines
ya I think kalau they interview me ah I hopefully will get like fifty
orang tak tahu apa gusi gusi is gum
I mean nervous pun macam gusi you don't know what is gusi
aduh and then there's one person cakap apa I don't have gusi
kelakar lah
I also don't like watch local youtube tapi because I like to um macam bab melayu-melayu ini I suka dengar orang macam tersasul ke apa kan so I suka tengok itu then laugh my lah lah you know
best ke
ya sudah tak ada sudah
I think the ya the last romance movie ah I tengok dekat cinema is apa eh crazy rich asians
go watch lah it's very nice tapi yang I tak suka is macam dia tak macam mix tau
macam dia punya portrayal of singapore macam very atas gitu
huh uh it's like nanti orang ingat semua kita kaya I have overseas friends dia orang ingat oh you crazy rich ah I macam I macam huh no aduh
sis literally if I have the money I will borong the store
you tahu tak dia punya macam dia macam jacket dia macam fur fur gitu
dia macam banyak-banyak colour tapi dia macam jacket and it's furry furry on the outside
tak pernah nampak eh
oh bukan yang hood punya dia tak ada hood
I bought it err okay last year masa I kerja I pergi rush pergi uniqlo I don't know why during my lunch break lepas itu I pergi capai itu oh my god it is like the best spend out of my pocket money
no lah I think it's about twenty dollars or ya twenty dollars lebih
uh ke I bought it in malaysia no lah I bought it in singapore
twenty to thirty dollars macam gitu ah
but what am I saying uniqlo punya baju semua comfortable
ya uniqlo punya memang really the best ah
tapi if you want to find like macam vintage vintage and oversized shirt kan cotton on is still the best though
okay I tak suka oversized shirt tapi depends kalau dia punya
dia punya how to say graphic dekat depan itu cantik then I will probably buy it
if macam tak cantik I tak akan beli lah
tapi honestly
banyak orang suka pergi thrift shopping
err lucky plaza banyak
I think you pergi yang tingkat atas atas punya
I can't believe you know baju champion yang our parents wear last time
can fetch up to fifty and above sekarang
mm pada pendapat saya
kalau boleh I want a fit body because err I suka main bola err football kan
so err kalau I'm more fit I can you know run faster err I can play better I can improve my performance ah in game
kan you tahu I main untuk err kelab bola
err dan
apa tu err
err I juga suka pergi gym I like
bila I go to gym I
of course kadangkala like of course everyone wants to have good looks lah you know you go out then if take photo with friends or what or like you know you want to get girlfriend all you need good looks what so err ya lah ya got pros and cons lah for both but
err mungkin I pick the fit body lah
mm yang tu betul juga err
going by that thought process kalau gitu mungkin I pun nak ah good looks ah sebab
err macam you kata pe good looks tu err semua genetics tapi fit body I can I can train you know I can work for it especially now we are young right so fit body is a bit easier to get lah you know then
err tapi bila dah tua err semua tu good looks semua
habis lah jadi
kalau long term
aku rasa fit body lebih penting lah sebab untuk err general health and well-being kan
illnesses you know heart problems diabetes ke apa
err kalau gitu
mungkin kan sekarang everyone err selalu cakap pasal err global warming ni global warming tu our climate change ke apa I mean you just look at our weather lah everyday also in the forecast also always wrong one they say rain won't rain will be so hot then kalau err hujan pun
can have sun sometimes then it's like macam air panas aje
so I feel like err humans will go extinct from like all these like global global warming factors lah err mungkin like slowly over time when the sea levels rise ke then all the you know kampung by the the seaside all will become flooded and stuff like that or like mungkin will have err
lebih banyak err natural disaster semua
tsunami ke gempa bumi ke
extinct mungkin kalau macam sekarang ada COVID kan tu virus
tu virus semua like
especially kalau tengok err kalau singapore okay lah sekarang itu case semua sudah fall a lot right
mungkin dia orang punya culture semua berbeza kan jadi
err mereka suka peluk semua kan jadi like this kind of like easily transmitted disease through contact
ini dua faktor lah yang mungkin akan ah menyebabkan err we as humans to go extinct lah
you cakap pasal africa kan tadi aku ingat lah err kat sekolah we learn about econs right err they always talk about the income inequality increasing and all that like and then they talk about the millennium development goals then aku teringat lah pasal err err extreme hunger err yang disrupt disebabkan oleh poverty kan jadi
I feel mungkin that's another reason lah there could be the could be the factor or the the cause of like err humans slowly like the population reducing lah I'm not sure if you boleh sampai extinct semua tapi
err I feel like it could reduce their population a lot overtime if the let's say you know econs they teach us they measure by gini coefficient right if it keep increasing increasing the rich get richer yang miskin jadi lebih miskin then um
err all these err kind of err things like malnutrition all also can increase the diseases and all that because your immune system tak kuat kan jadi
the income inequality makin naik and the
ya lah so maybe the if the government don't do um anything to tolong kan the orang yang miskin orang yang
tak mampu then um
maybe lah this could be a factor that might contribute but mungkin err bukan main cause lah untuk err menyebabkan err apa tu err extinction of humans
skill tu you like do you mean like err
if that's the case right I mean maybe untuk saya lah err
I hope to be able to how to say macam like
boleh read people better lah
cause kalau gitu I can I boleh faham apa yang orang tengah fikir tu and I can like um
I err mungkin err bukan saja cara you cakap tapi err
mungkin err body language intonasi semua err
err ya lah itu like that's one of the first skill like I feel like err would be very beneficial lah and it's bukan satu skill yang senang untuk belajar pun it's like
lebih banyak confidence ah like especially um
dalam scenario macam public speaking depan err banyak orang
um like stage confidence lah not not just speaking you know maybe like anything in front of a large group of people lah but like err buat err presentation ke err nak buat acting ke err
anything that has to do with like err maybe a high pressure situation or err like situations with like other consequence kan macam like pertandingan bola ke where there's a there's a price at hand you you can you can dapat something lah you can win something at the end of the pertandingan ah so
like this kind of err situation where you tend to put pressure on yourself or a lot of people watching you like let's say ada coach yang tengah scouting err player yang err baru yang young talent semua
err I feel like it's it's a very useful skill lah next time bila nak kerja semua kalau boss aku err suruh err buat presentation depan err colleagues aku semua then you know if I have the confidence I after preparing all my things I can present well do a good presentation dia orang semua faham apa yang I nak cakap
then um kalau the third skill maybe err
like being more optimistic err positive fikiran semua err mindset
nak err aku nak yang
lebih ceria lah like I punya mood semua like
I feel like kalau any problem aku hadap
if I face it with like a a a positive mindset err kalau err as hard as it can be susah ke tak susah I can I can convince myself motivate myself to go through whatever struggles and skill ni penting cause it can help me to push through like let's say um
err gym kalau aku penat ke apa my next my next set I can just err keep staying positive motivate myself in my mind I focus on my goals and I just pursue them
besides gym lah like err bola ke like next time nak kerja ke anything in life like I I feel like ni ni benda ni confidence dengan yang positive tu err sangat penting lah but ia bukan skill yang
senang untuk err cultivate ini skill err mesti
ambil time yang lama lah mesti build up over time tapi kalau sekarang I boleh dapat ah tiga-tiga skill ni wah paling best ah
oh third one macam like err it's like a positive mindset you have like a optimistic outlook on life you know yourself worth you know you know why you belong and you you are self driven self motivated
apa-apa pun boleh lah
wah kalau free tu
tapi kalau gitu overlap macam skill kan bukan saja benda physical
sekarang sekarang benda yang high value kan yang kita kena bayar banyak
err let's say err gold ke or stocks yang property ke apa
bila you cakap free kan
free untuk kita sendiri ke free untuk semua orang
kalau gitu stocks lah kerana kalau I boleh dapat stocks yang banyak
I boleh jual I boleh dapat wang lagi yang banyak lepas tu I can just use it to spend on whatever I want lah whatever else I want because by then I'll be rich what
dia percuma untuk saya tapi untuk orang lain orang lain kena bayar jadi the value is still there but only for me is free so I can use this method to I can keep purchasing all these stocks especially now you look at tesla ni semua
err apa-apa lah yang err involve dengan benda teknologi
semua ni benda err dia punya stocks semua naik naik exponentially lah
if I boleh dapat ni benda semua I I can just you know err
then from there I can build up my wealth I can become rich boleh tolong keluarga saya kawan-kawan saya semua you know I can I can whatever that is material I can dapat dengan wang err I can I can have lah
like time is limited lah setiap hari tak ada dua puluh empat jam sahaja
I tahu lah kita tinggal di singapura ni singapore so small right they always say like you want to get to one side of the island to the other side is a short time only compared to other big countries but
kalau you boleh teleport you nak pergi kerja pergi sekolah you know you want to visit your friends family wherever in the world also
just having that additional satu dua jam setiap hari I mean it could be even more for some people because
you can get more sleep your tidur is good you err
your health pun lebih baik um
you know you nak err like
ada orang kan yang
dia orang err very stress at work or that they are they live very busy life all consumed by their work
but until dia orang takde masa untuk keluarga
tapi bila ada lebih masa ni you boleh spend time dengan keluarga ke girlfriend ke apa you know your family time is a is a very err important thing but I feel like in today's world is err is lacking lah because err people who are always in a rush no not enough time because of
travelling and all that you know like selalu kalau err jalan sesak traffic jam or accident hujan ke then you waste even more time lah so if you can teleport around you know I mean unrealistic lah but superpower right so if you can teleport around of course ideally not just yourself lah if other people also then you nak pergi holiday over the weekend pun boleh apa err so
you as a as a person your like whoever is around you lah cause you can teleport you yourself and then semua sama-sama pergi mana-mana pun boleh
are you more of a marvel fan atau you lebih suka
mungkin hulk lah kerana
dia tu like
he's still a normal human being lah but bila dia marah then then only dia transform kan jadi like
if I'm always having to be seen as the superhuman superhero with superpower then like I feel like the expectation terhadap diri saya akan it will be very high lah from everyone from myself all but if I can still be like a normal human being at the same time as being a superhero
tapi like as needed lah I can I can still possess
kalau you
untuk saya I feel like a lot of people like sebab I banyak training like
like err semua orang selalu label me as like err buff strong whatever
especially dulu bila bila eh err start of this year right when I had the shoulder err shoulder surgery and all that
whenever I am injured lah like not just the shoulder surgery actually like dulu I pun ada ankle sprain ni semua
I selalu err rasa macam
hati tersinggung sikit lah kerana like
um be at the level that high level of fitness um because everyone err selalu tengok saya macam
like bukan sahaja uh dari segi performance tapi like
bila I ganti baju pun kawan saya pun selalu kacau saya pasal err
badan saya lah jadi like if I feel like if I'm not on point at one point also like
as much as pressure tu tekanan tu
boleh tolong untuk err drive you motivate you tapi like if you don't know how to manage it you don't know how to handle it or you let's say you memang your mood
it can affect you sometimes and like it can pull you down even further lah you boleh cause itu macam apa tu dia orang panggil macam spiral
jadi susah sikit lah untuk you nak um
terukan aktiviti harian lah or your
because everything needs your willpower right like even you nak ganti baju nak pilih baju apa untuk pakai pun it takes you like some willpower to think about what you are going to do so like when you are lacking that willpower you memang bukan malas lah tapi like you really not feeling it like you just don't want to do any anything you nak just like
is it can become a real mood killer lah as much as like oh you think like err having this fit body like we said earlier lah tadi um
biasanya dilihat sebagai suatu label yang baik lah tapi
mungkin at times can be a bad label also lah I feel but
I feel like this is the paling paling common lah yang label yang semua kawan-kawan saya
dream occupation saya is err to be a physiotherapist kan so
also in five years six years time lepas uni depends on my situation lah if especially
kalau I masih single ke I dah attached because like if I have someone else then I have to
like err bukan sahaja keluarga tapi ni
I need to of course like devote some portion of my time to that person lah but okay err kalau kita assume tak ada orang tu I masih single I
masih tengah focus on my own goals
err lepas habis uni I'm probably be bonded to err one of the err government hospital kan
my work hours mungkin tak akan flexible sangat jadi
whatever free time yang I ada mungkin like
sekali seminggu lah I I will just contact my family and all then just check on them and then like um like how to say like
I I still go to the gym you know err kalau tak cukup masa maybe just a short workout lah empat puluh lima minit ke apa
you know and ideally would be of course with a with a friend lah cause kalau you train seorang-seorang pun err after a while it it kind of
could be a bit boring sometimes could be unmotivating and stuff tapi ideally if you have always have err
a training partner especially a training partner who selalu banyak tenaga banyak tenaga very like
energetic you know err selalu err give you a lot of vocal cues you know pushing you
bila dia spotting you kan then err I feel like that that would be ideal lah like this is the this is the minimum that I hope lah I just
um berharap like next time I I dapat macam work life balance lah orang cakap like
kerja pun I dapat dream job I I enjoy my work I boleh tolong orang like especially like if I can
become like a private sports err physiotherapist after I dah habis I punya bond dengan err hospital government hospital right and um
at that time I will look back and like I as an athlete like I did I sometimes and I need but like I tak tak cukup duit lah because this kind of service all can be quite expensive lah but I hope to be able to
tahap yang paling tinggi lah because like
bila dengan pertolongan daripada physiotherapy ni err you punya muscles semua like
boleh recover lah you punya recovery semua err lebih baik you you
jadi like
I tak dapat jadi I nak kasih orang lain untuk experience especially athlete athlete yang masih muda masih ada potential untuk
tak tahu lah mungkin boleh represent negara ke apa err ya like
that's that's the idealist scenario untuk saya lah like
bila I kerja pagi ke apa or mungkin I gym pagi err kerja sampai malam tengok lah then
but of course kalau I dah ada err orang lain dalam in my life lah like I have a girl then of course I need to you know like she'll probably be working also so
depending on our schedule lah but I will try of course try my best to make time for her you know maybe sekali seminggu just like we go out for like a date night or something like that just to maintain the relationship lah cause I feel like it's
kasih you punya masa kena sacrifice sikit lah untuk dia cause um
oh ya cakap pasal itu I forgot one of my passions is also to
err kayuh basikal lah jadi like
ideally if if my my working hours pendek sikit um
I boleh slot in masa untuk err girlfriend masa untuk err gym tapi juga untuk err cycling lah and
paling best kalau I ada satu kumpulan cycling macam like a cycling bukan maybe not like a very professional team like just like a cycling group lah then
like every maybe bila tak panas lah maybe
early morning ke err lewat malam ke then
we just you know ride around singapore together road cycling ah road cycling bukan err trail riding
dia memastikan yang I masih aktif lah bila I dah tua nanti
kerana gym mungkin after some time like bila dah tua err apa tu
you punya joints semua mungkin ada another problem lah tapi cycling
err dia punya risks tu rasa kurang sikit lah
you you ride a bike on the main road or jalan raya kan
I feel like err asalkan you it could err ikut peraturan jalan raya semua you follow the rules you just play safe lah you are you pakai lights all you are well seen and especially if you ride in group lah is safer cause you can or like look out for one another and you
I bukan nak masuk pertandingan ke apa I just like for casual for enjoyment like
untuk err general health and well-being sahaja lah but
it's a fun way lah for me untuk untuk dapat kan err
kerana gym
you punya cardiovascular health you punya jantung semua tu tak akan um
won't be trained as much lah tapi kalau nak buat cycling ke untuk you lari ke apa your
your this apa cardiovascular health will err naik ah you will improve boleh maintain semua
jadi um
err in the long run lah is aku rasa suatu yang penting tapi mungkin
err tak boleh dilakukan tapi kalau ideal scenario I nak lah kerana
each ride will take about what dua jam
so it's it's quite time consuming the sense cause kalau gym empat puluh minit you know you go in go out get it done
it's it's it's okay lah but err kalau cycling you kena gear up semua you
jumpa kawan and then you go for your ride it it takes a while lah and mungkin along the way sometimes we have like a pit stop just for coffee or whatever break you know just some minum slight makan just snacks then
a lot of things ya a lot of things changed lah I mean um I mean my habits and err routines banyak dah tukar ya so especially sekarang kena work from home so that sort of things that you have to adapt to yourself ya
so so nak tanya sikit so you rasa this COVID right have err actually changed you to be a better person ke you rasa macam COVID is such a you know is making your life difficult
ya the good thing now you boleh spend time dengan parents you kan like you know more more time to get home you know daripada keluar because there's not much to do outside and and you cannot kita tak boleh travel so there's a lot of restrictions going on ya
so sekarang you have a new skill lah you the pro lah kan when it comes to like designing
boleh buat poster lah ni you know like marketing advertising okay not bad uh that's interesting okay
yes ya last time I feel like err it's such a waste I'm repaying every month untuk for netflix then sekarang macam it's a good thing I'm subscribing it and I'm utilizing the
ya or probably do some activities like err cycling you know ya probably I mean err tentative now the weather has you know ah you tahu lah kan weather dia sekarang nak hujan
hujan sekejap you know panas so I'm not sure if cycling is a good activity to do this weekend but it's just err tentative plan
oh really dekat dekat town is it bali lane okay
I should I should try ah I should pergi and you know mesti mesti weekends long queue kan and there's a lot of um
jadi dia tak macam ya they block the seats lah okay
okay true tak tahu eh sekarang ada movie apa yang best I mean dah lama juga tak check online usually now because we prefer to watch it online jadi um for us to go physically to the cinema macam
cause you punya orang suka advance planning is it ya and also you kerja shift kan and also pasal your um off days
I I I also prefer um cause I have a schedule so I actually like it when um someone make plans in advance so macam teratur sikit your you know your week for the week so ya
kalau orang buat advance planning err
kalau orang buat advance planning and then err you know suddenly they screw up or they couldn't make it and especially kalau kita plan big um occasions or err you know like err birthday parties or anything then lepas tu cancel it will be very hard you know
I mean if if you don't like something you upfront about it err you know I mean if you keep it to yourself then I I somewhat later I I found out about it I'll be very marah you know I'll be like very angry or like why are you not honest kenapa you tak just you know admit things that you you don't like
so that's one thing that I'm very particular about like err because like maybe it's not a good thing kalau you terlalu upfront atau terlalu honest but I believe that if you don't like something ya
ya because I I don't want to like keep things and then you simpan or kalau let's say you marah and then you you keep things to yourself then
uh but you you still not happy about it so you you know macam it doesn't goes well you know I really prefer ya to be honest and let it out about your feelings
so that um you know there's no macam terasa hati that kind of thing
ya lama kenal and then still keep in touch with err it use to be my primary school friend but then as we
instagram or social media ya because err most most of them are married with kids so macam they're busy dengan activity dia orang while
for me like you know I'm still I'm single so it's like I have more time so nak ajak dia orang keluar semua susah so now the best way is to communicate through social media
that's good that's good okay ya that I mean even though um you know tak boleh jumpa and all but the best thing is like at least keep in touch keep in contact tanya khabar you know that's a very good thing
uh ya macam mana you tahu
um playing on my err playlist these few months ever since err COVID has been you know going on so I discover new music um suka um I if I I like one music maybe I'll play a couple of times kalau suka the same music then I'll just have the same
tengah hujan but I know that you are the opposite right you suka loud music kan you don't like macam cooling cooling
for someone who's introvert then suka loud music ya
instrumental as in ada orang nyanyi ke is there anyone singing the music or just the playing instrument
ah tu itu kalau untuk tidur best eh
so I dengar by the way err you recently just start up a small business
kan uh macam yang
oh okay uh apa tu what's that
so macam mana you dapat the idea of um starting up that um small business of yours
so err berapa lama you dah you know venture into this small business
ya betul true
so um now that um you dah venture this err for the trial semua for three months so err what are some of the obstacles that err you actually face throughout macam err susah that you had to struggle along the way just for this business is there anything
actually this is a really a from what I heard from you punya explanation tadi kan I think this is such a good um way you know to to start up like you know anyway you pun masih muda and then err I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you
to start up like you know anyway you pun masih muda and then err I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you doing this alone or you ada team lain macam
that's good so but but then you are they're also working full time right dia orang pun kerja
mm if you're if you are talking about business um ya there's a few things err on my mind yang I lama lah actually plan out you know like one of them was like doing a set up leather sandals you know that I was planning to create a project err to help you know to actually um
kind of like support um like err you know small err other businesses that can help me to err create a a leather sandal so at the same time I'm supporting them and at the same time they are also helping me err to create err the leather sandals as per what I request yang I suka
err tapi at the same time err that this project is like the money will be going to err those in need is not for my own profit that's one of the project yang I tengah tengok
but then sebab sekarang tengah pandemic so I um um venture out and actually look at the quality and all to um the stuff
err I need to be kat sana physically to be there you know so it's kind of hard to communicate through ya on the phone so that kind of project I need to put on hold dulu lah so I tak boleh I cannot err
through err communication through err whatsapp pun it's very hard cause everything will be sent through pictures and you pun touch the material the quality ya so all these macam err I don't know like pandemic has um kind of like err stop err a lot of um my plans you know ya
so I'm trying to be as positive as possible hoping that maybe next year things will get better for us you know kita boleh travel and
and you know err the economy pun kat other countries err affected kan like err because we have been travelling to support like
other countries you know to to support um you know when as we travel um like like for example malaysia kita semua pergi err to buy things ya all this now sekarang kita tak boleh we cannot go over
mahal ya and everything kind of like limited if you notice macam sometimes you nak look at look out for your stuff tapi dah habis ya people tend to stock up a lot
all this like macam kind of like err a bit difficult for us to travel around and um to look out for things that macam susah nak dapat you know nowadays cause everything um macam senang aje is very easy err to to sold out so you have to
err you know order online you know get it from other country purchase kat you know from other countries and err get it delivered here in singapore so this is like kind of a big challenge but at the same time it makes us you know um be stronger as err you know as a country as a as together
so anyway err okay let me ask you something okay kalau sekiranya
kalau sekiranya err um flight dah buka lah the the the the plane is you can start to buy tickets to go anywhere so the first thing you nak pergi where would you want to go in your mind what's in the first thing on your mind
really you nak pergi morocco
macam dah lama lah it it's on your mind that you want to
oh you dah pergi you have been to norway so you went
kalau macam new zealand ke you know that kind of place orang selalu buat road trip kan you know like new zealand australia that kind of place orang selalu might sewa like err rent a caravan kan or
or do some road trip and um do some macam camping camping punya style lah kan compared to it's not a city vibes punya kind of
so it kalau macam gini you cannot err bring your parents lah kan do you think it's a good place to bring like elderly
ya and also like macam accessibility into halal you know the the food all and
um places to macam err to go to toilet all these kind of things you have to consider because maybe err the elderly might not err err feel that err comfort they they won't feel comfortable to to you know
stay imagine like you know when when you bring your parents to stay in a caravan kind of vibe I tak rasa they might you know they will like it because it's um something new tapi untuk dia orang nak masak ke nak makan they have their own preference kan kalau you notice
because I've experienced before macam err even though my mum is um she likes to travel juga lah kan she's okay with thing we can see that at the end of the day
she will still bring her like macam food lah she's not open to try the food from other countries she will still bring like macam maggi or whatever that is from singapore itself
or macam sambal you know err her own comfort food lah dia still akan prefer that compared to macam to venture out and try all the different kinds of err
food from the country that we are heading to so dia tak akan really macam kalau makan pun sikit aje
just a bit so dia tak akan macam into it
so kalau for me myself when I travel I would love to
ya correct that's why like they always pair err apa on standby they will bring err like sambal on the go you know to correct ya
ya interesting cause we err we get to you know like when you travel with your friends and when you travel with your err family or parents the the experience is different because maybe uh there's a lot of things that macam
might occur you know like um how the pace of how you want to travel the places you nak pergi you kena consider maybe parents not you know not okay with the places that you nak pergi tapi kalau dengan friends you are more flexible there's lot of things that you can do together
ya so macam it it it's something um you know sometimes when I nak travel pun I will consider like should I bring my mum along or um okay lah tempat ni maybe I err just bring my friends you know because of the places that I want to go back but maybe my mum would not um
see the volcano err dekat indo something kan nak naik err the gunung but my mum say that oh tak boleh it's very dangerous you know but my friends will be like hey that's interesting you know ya but we check all the safety precautions err precautions and such tapi my mum will still think that tak boleh you know
ya true ya ya semua tanggung dengan parents
okay um I just love snow okay I suka winter even though
good experience for me to err to finally dapat rasa you know how how it feels like because before this I've never been to any western countries and yang ke mana-mana yang ada snow
so bila I dapat experience snow tu I was like a bit jakun lah then I was like a bit like wow snow and then err at one point I was like okay it's getting too cold ya the the weather was so bad sampai negative the temperature was really bad ya but um
suddenly I was like okay I I cannot stand it I was like okay I'm so glad that um you know I'm staying in singapore cause singapore panas pun panas but I don't have to suffer compared when I was in sejuk dia macam one kind ya
but um still I I suka snow because of I can main I can play with the snow and then err and then the the the season like the vibes um
winter is like towards end of the month I mean end of the year sorry err so dia macam the feeling dia to christmas lagi-lagi macam so you build a snowman you know all these kind of things so I I to be honest even until now
cause like winter kan that's when the only time you boleh pakai thick jackets and then you can
you know you can wear like all the pullovers yang all the seluar kat singapore you tak boleh you know you cannot wear them so this is like a good I always think that way like this is like a good time for me to wear all the boots you know during winter
look different ya but then um ya kind of like waste after that I don't know what to do with the my my all all my jackets semua I tak tahu
it's not appropriate to be to be worn here ya so but now the worst thing is err pandemic so plus points still cannot travel so all these um jackets I'm not sure what should I do with it like should I jual ke you know
or should I buang you know ya
I would really err want to I really nak one thing that I really nak pergi after this err one place sorry err would be japan ya
I've been trying to err but then I heard a lot of things like macam mahal juga lah their their you know like to travel I don't I'm not sure maybe bila pergi japan you pernah pergi kan
korea dengan japan ada ada beza tak what do you think
I think we singaporeans kena belajar eh from them basic manners
I just want to try the train kalau to get to experience dekat japan you know like where the they have bullet train ya bullet train ya
ya I I heard a lot about err pasal japan and the culture and the food and I mean I I heard good food err I mean um that japan has a lot of good food tapi macam when it comes to the
price wise and to travel I heard like it's quite costly but I really want to visit tokyo though like um ya macam tokyo is like one of my destinations that I've been wanting to to to go
maybe next time maybe you can bring me since you dah pernah pergi err japan kan
last time kita tak appreciate err buat travelling kan kita selalu err feel that okay anytime boleh pergi you know next time lah next year but then sekarang when it's really like macam stop us from travel
the feeling is like macam oh all these while especially kalau pasal gambar macam like let's say kita dah frequent pergi that country
ah tak payah lah ambil gambar ah tak payah pergi you know then all these memories macam oh no it's wasted macam sayangnya kalau tahu aku ambil gambar that kind of thing
anything that you nak tanya I
afraid of insect does it count you know even like the small thing small insect like err small spider or semut sometimes I can be like you know
I I tak nak pegang I don't want to I don't want to kill it tak tak nak you know even though kita pakai tissue to throw it to angkat kan ya I'll be like tak nak you know just scared
cicak you know like lizards all these ya
I think it's it's stupid lah because orang cakap like dah mati apa for example especially when it's dead kan then dah mati apa so like just just angkat lah but I still like no I got that fear and
because maybe because um kalau you naik plane then kan ada clouds like covering so you tak nampak tau bawah sangat
and you are in a macam covered closed like you're inside the plane what so tak you tak exposed sangat you know to look down tapi kalau let's say it's a
macam you nak kena jump from a high a high building or something err you have to look down kan so probably for me I'll be very scared to do that but I guess you are you're not right from the way I look at you I think you are adventurous
actually err when I was in hong-kong kan I was scared of cable car ya sorry that was side track err I was in hong-kong so err I naik this err cable car tau you know the three hundred sixty so it's like full glass
so it's err so you boleh nampak bawah your kaki can look through kat bawah so I thought that it's just a normal cable car impossible that I'll be scared naik cable car biasa boleh apa but then when I took the three hundred sixty cable car it was like
you kind of distract because you can see everything so it's all clear and you feel that you going to macam jatuh the feeling
so I guess ya even you naik luge kan you kan dia macam open luge as in the apa yang the skyride tu yang dekat sentosa
ah ya correct that one itu pun macam open apa ya your legs dangling so macam
that one also I won't dare to macam ambil ambil video ambil gambar cause I scared that you know it might drop
so ya so my afraid of heights thing macam is kind of critical ah I feel tapi orang cakap it's quite silly lah but to me it's like it's something that I'm scared tapi orang lain probably they they find it like it's just heights you know
oh so where where did the spider tu apa lari then pergi somewhere like left or you had to kill it you kena bunuh
actually is is that the spider yang you tahu kaki dia like tipis ke ke dia
tapi kan ada kaki yang spider yang tipis ada yang very
I'm so glad like macam kalau singapore tak you you know tak macam sangat lah you know masuk spider but then if you are in kalau macam summer um season that's when the spiders um start to appear in in your house
so they start to masuk because maybe I think it's a it's a great weather to be in but
kalau let's say for example I suruh you err go and pick up a cockroach yang dah mati you boleh lah just use your bare hands angkat macam gitu
just like that angkat kaki dia ke orang boleh you know just
ee antenna okay I mean you boleh angkat macam gitu with your bare hands oh no
speaking of insects kan so err what do you think about orang-orang yang err actually eat eat insects like what what do you think like err is it okay to if let's say someone were to ask you to eat you boleh ke makan cambodian for example they ya they are like kind of into insects
so they it's it's not the same as where you found the insect outside you know macam it's not the the same kind of insect so they kind of clean and I don't know lah what where they found those kind of insect
only if they actually boil it first so it like it it it can macam at least the texture of the the dia punya shell macam edible I don't I don't know how they do it because
pork is part of their you know macam culture they like to eat ya
but I know I can see that you are an android user you pakai samsung so that's so how do how do you what do you think about um samsung
front camera ke atau yang back the back camera
dia punya music dia kan
ya ada yang baru punya you know the the flip phone is it err samsung ya I I saw that it looks kind of cool you know you can just
flip your phone and then like very compact you boleh letak dalam bag you what do you think of that
the middle part tu lah the screen punya macam
quite a lot for iphone you know and then bila they they start to have like ah tak ada charger err you have to buy different kind of you know the the cable now is like a bit different right if you notice kalau you tengok dia punya
bahagian at the top part I think it's different I mean I mean not the top part but as in maybe the the the charge itself I can see the difference with the old err ya the cable wire ya so it's like um
ya ya correct correct so you nak beli the head tu you kena beli a specific a different one ya anyway it's been a great time I got to go you know err I need to you know I'll get back to work so it's it's been a nice time to catch up with you err so kalau nanti free you just
tu lah eh bila eh kita last jumpa each other
oh that time kita
oh apa ni yang
oh ya ya ya ya okay okay okay but that's not counted as jumpa lah because it was on google meet
and I think just because of this recording baru lah kita nak jumpa
kalau tak aku rasa next year baru aku jumpa kau
macam for me leceh seh you know like
for me lah for me like kau nak
like kau nak kena work from home then kau kena go back office might as well just work from home kan because your job pun doesn't really require you to like
you know it's like very easy what you just err turn on your laptop and then duduk depan screen jer
but to be honest it's really very taxing because it's like you have to be there from like morning eight thirty usually lah my daily my daily apa err daily timetable will be like lapan setengah eight thirty then
kalau at most pun I will end about what five six kau imagine kau duduk in front of the screen for that one whole day
ya because for me kan aku macam
aku pun I I love to be honest I love to be at home but like to be at home
eh kau tahu tak actually kan sekarang the thing that we are doing now right aku feel macam deja vu tau aku feel like
aku pernah mimpi pasal this whole scenario serious I mean I mean now like what we are doing now
aku feel like deja vu sia ni
I will make it through lah as always dah nak dekat final year kan
but you know like I feel like I've been err apa ni stress eating tau
I mean when you are stressed you I I keep I keep like macam apa um
brody um brody pula err body project
then macam
macam he the guy is very
macam very inspirational ah very motivational nanti dia macam dia kelakar like every time like dia dah habis dia punya whole exercise kan nanti last last kan bila apa ni cool down kan nanti dia kasih macam those motivational speech nanti isteri dia will be like apa jer apa jer budak ni buat cause like dia punya speech is good lah because dia akan cakap things like
err okay the fact that you have err chosen this err this this workout the fact that you have chosen this video means that err you know that macam you know he's trying to say that err macam well done lah because like kau err kau decides to do this workout
in a way macam well done so like he's trying to make us feel very motivated because after like cause dia orang ada macam the the workout varies tau dia macam ada forty minutes I think the the least is like ten minutes
after forty minutes kau feel like you want to die right
so actually his speech is really very inspiring macam kau feel like okay ya that's why aku take this this this whole
it was like six years ago but only recently macam dia orang famous I think
kau try ah one day ya
because recently okay aku tried macam the videos from six years ago and the videos lah recently
yang six years six years ago is like purely macam because I think dia orang just started out right so macam dia orang very err
very macam mana nak cakap eh macam very rigid very cardio cardio you know macam dia orang punya videos macam really okay thirty second nanti ada countdown gitu sekarang dah macam more chillax macam dia orang ada letak lagu
it's good lah macam kau joget and then lagu dia macam
so kau don't feel like you are actually exercising
ya especially now that you are working from home kau nak kena really seh have to make time
because aku just recently started doing the cardio kan then there's this whole whole week yang aku tak err felt well so I didn't do workout aku dia punya apa
dia punya exhaustion tu dia punya level of exhaustion boleh rasa seh because it's like
you know kau feel so tired then kau feel like macam lemah
you know so that's why aku rasa like you you have to like um
actually aku have this intention tau like every morning bangun
pergi jogging
ya but actually you macam we must tau because I mean you're not getting any younger and then like um
our health ni is really very important because recently I just bought a kau tahu yang the blood pressure punya monitor cause my mum few days ago dia sakit kan yang dia pergi doctor tu so she had like macam high blood pressure lah
it was really very high so macam mm the doctor suruh pergi suruh beli that machine to monitor so I bought bought from watsons
beli ah then the past few days we've been checking our
then err my adik punya was like
hundred and fifty like below hundred and thirty gitu macam normal lah then my adik cakap eh tak kak tak tak err it is normal for me hundred and fifty lepas tu aku macam are you sure your are you sure it's normal abeh dia cakap kak I'm fat then aku
ya so aku macam oh is it cause
for me kan aku aku don't really bother about this kind of thing tau to be honest
ya so aku macam recently aku macam fikir eh actually really seh I've been eating a lot of unhealthy food
and then kau tengok lah muka aku ni macam this pimple it's really a sign that says that I'm not I I feel like I haven't been glowing
you know and I feel so macam
very sucky like you know like macam kau
because you can you can really see from your your face tau kalau kau really glow you know that kind of thing so that's why aku these few days aku feel like err really seh I could really feel like I need to wake up in the morning and go for a jog
ya true that's why lah aku cakap aku aku aku feel like I haven't been taking care of myself lately ever since err start online learning ni
cause aku feel like
to be honest macam dulu aku malam-malam aku letak letak apa those facial punya benda ah serious aku moisturizer aku really very very very consistent sekarang aku dah macam
ah lantak kau ah aku really malas tau then aku sekarang
aku could feel so
menyesal ah aku really menyesal
hey you sure kau step jer you are saying this because you are my friend
eh no but I actually kan aku feel you should like makeover ah your room
no kau kena macam letak dari sana
but what colour was your light macam is it like the macam
but you also bought yang the the stars thingy right the constellation punya lampu
but tak macam
macam mana nak cakap eh macam kau tidur tak tak affected your sleep ke
bila kau nyanyi kan
tahu selalu nampak kau punya story
bila kau tengah aurora tu maknanya kau tengah nyanyi ah
kan kita kindergarten tak sama kan eh no sama
your kindergarten yang dekat sana tu kan
bukan oh your kindergarten kat gek poh
your kindergarten is under the punya kan
sama lah
but mine was like err near the pioneer area sana
or maybe tak lah maybe we met in err primary school
bila eh kita start
it's always like that macam kau bila kau in the same environment with the person kan kau tak kau tak macam close tau nanti kalau kau dah habis sekolah ke apa habis macam habis kerja ke apa kan nanti kau just randomly
pergi trip dengan dia lah pergi holiday dengan dia lah
ya I have that friend also like my this one ex colleague dulu macam like when I was working with her
kita tak berbual langsung tau because
aku like macam kirakan assistant dia executive lah different roles kan because that time I was still taking my diploma she was already like degree holder gitu so different roles so I was like in one office and she was in another room
kita tak kita tak rapat then after I left then like tiba randomly kita because like for me like after after I left right usually I will like add them on facebook or instagram
then dia
dia macam random tiba-tiba dia ajak aku like pergi the one the one that I went perth with
and then the funny thing is like aku pergi trip dengan not only her but also with her sister and then like so funny like kita tiga like considered like strangers but then like when we were at perth kita just clicked instantly tau
and then aku macam amazed because
it's just so macam orang cakap macam senang ah masuk
aku just be real dengan kau ah
kau tahu kan recently dia sakit
oh okay so it's really very way back ah okay okay so macam macam gini
dia sakit kan
it was err before he balik
okay so he sakit tekak and stuff like that initially we thought it was like because of him smoking
so I was like macam
err because he's okay not only his throat tau then he always has like macam ulcer
so we tried like natural remedies lah macam kasih dia minum like those um honey lemon kasih dia pakai yang kau tahu bonjela gel stuff like that
so he went back he went back home then err macam biasa kena quarantine and stuff like that then macam aku cakap dengan dia err you go jumpa doctor kat sana jumpa clinic kat sana cause first of all it's cheaper and and and kau at least like macam
err at least get to the bottom of it lah because if not you don't know what's happening kan because we've been trying natural remedies and then it's not working lepas tu dia pergi clinic kat sini pun
it's not working as well and then one thing aku geram pasal dia kan is that dia nak benda kan nak nak dia sakit dia nak cepat like instantaneously tau
abeh aku macam eh come on lah like kau nak baik needs time to recover kan but dia tak dia macam nak kau tahu macam makan ubat hari ni esok nak baik
where got such thing right so okay tu tak apa then he like err
but he balik
okay he balik then um he
he balik
and apa eh
he balik he went for doctor and stuff like that
the doctor cakap
err he has to go for like further check up dekat err specialists but it will take time
so right now he's actually on err renal diet ah renal diet ni macam um less salt less sodium less potassium kalau kau ingat aku aku kadang-kadang aku post dekat instagram yang gambar-gambar masak it was actually for him
I don't know eh macam sometimes recently aku feel like um
macam mana nak cakap eh okay you know I'm a very
err okay even though aku introvert kan you know I'm a very outgoing person adventurous person and stuff like that
and then when aku with him aku feel like aku
but emotionally because aku feel like
few months kan it's it's always been about him okay maybe I'm selfish but it's always been about him and then like aku trying
macam okay kau tahu aku sakit tangan
aku don't feel the support from him also
aku tak tahu ah macam recently aku feel like
apa eh nak cakap eh
dia cakap dengan aku ah he said um okay you know of my condition and stuff like that kan like do you still want to be with me
but at that point of time aku was in err in a dilemma because
you know how um because okay I don't want to be that kind of girl yang macam
bila kau susah kau takde tapi bila kau senang kau ada you get what I mean
mesti ada ups and downs kan I want to be that kind of person who who has always been supportive
okay and when he asked me macam do you still want to be with me despite my condition aku felt
guilty aku felt bersalah because macam oh because of his condition now abeh aku nak tinggalkan dia
okay aku aku aku aku rasa kadang-kadang aku rasa macam aku pun depressed ah maybe because of the previous relationship I think my ex really really broke me
yang tadi aku jumpa tu I was telling her I said that you know sometimes
if if I macam if I could turn back time sometimes I wish macam there are some exes yang aku shouldn't have let go
macam I should you know my yang the ex from err poly tu yang dia nyanyi tu
you know like macam I I want those kind of relationship yang macam
kind of destroyed everything and then like you know recently aku added him on err instagram and then like a few days ago ah no actually was yesterday I saw his instagram story and I was tempted to message dia tau
but aku macam jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan message jangan cari pasal
like aku nak text but aku macam telling myself not to
but to be honest there are some there are times where aku felt like
he wanted different things and then there was a third party which aku ni gatal sangat pergi melayan the third party was my recent ex
so that's why aku like when I think about this whole thing kan aku feel like macam
I shouldn't have layan the ex man I mean I shouldn't have layan that third party
because you know you know that that time err during one of my um poly friend punya wedding kan we met
aku lupa tau aku honestly forgot that he was the cause of the break up
then aku introduce macam tak bersalah gitu lepas tu because I only I didn't notice at that point of time I only remembered when I was looking back at my memory box because I have this memory box where I apa tu
cause dulu aku dengan dia okay lah a bit cheesy lah we we write letters to each other
ya he's that kind of guy and aku I'm a sucker for letters like to me it's very sentimental and we have those you know macam coupons that was my birthday like gift lah to him macam coupons macam
okay um redeem this to get a free dinner ah macam redeem this to get a free massage ah macam gitu you know
there's this book that I wrote tau aku dengan dia tulis err tak kita macam okay kau tahu macam paper kan lepas tu kita macam gunting then kita macam staple lah tepi tu macam make it into a book so we wrote down like
things that I dislike about you serious things I like about you err what do you want to change in this relationship then macam appraisal
ya so so we did that so we did that then um apa ni err
I oh he wrote down that person name so like recently kan aku look through kan then aku realise oh my god he hated this person so I was like
and then I introduce them then aku was like oh my god what ya then I was like what did I do you know no no wonder okay lah because you know you know you know when a person is looking at you kan
I mean my ex yang best friend tu
err he was looking at me and then from dia macam dia tengok kan abeh kalau kau tengok dia tiba-tiba mata dia macam
I don't know because okay lah recently okay aku be honest with dengan kau eh
ya online through err because kita friends again what on instagram
I tried to like macam talk to him and stuff like that but
err a conversation into me lah macam with me so macam dia
macam kita berbual then after that nanti kadang-kadang dia just seen tak reply gitu so macam so aku macam okay lah but
because I was thinking about it lah cause you know two of my exes aku came back to them right two of my exes and then it didn't work out what kan
then I was thinking kalau if I were to get back with this ex kan
like I remember merepek gila ya allah I don't know it was like macam I think it was after his performance or something
okay I can't remember but I remember this one part where kita naik tau he was sitting at the two seater seat and I was sitting at the long seat tu
abeh dah sampai buona vista eh was it buona vista
so I just left keluar gitu I just left like that
and I just leave him dekat seorang seorang and
I recently yang we got back I mean not we got back like I added I mean added him on err instagram kan ya ya he followed me back so
err aku dia
aku told him lah okay actually it was very funny because aku
can I be honest I say ya sure sure lepas tu dia cakap
err you are a very sensitive person gini gini semua abeh dia cakap um it's better kau boleh tone down sikit kau punya err sensitivity but I was reading it and I was triggered
you know macam you don't tell me not to be sensitive but okay lah aku appreciate his err feedback
tak actually seriously dia dia baik tau because kan um but dia pun sayang aku
baik lah cuma aku jer shitty
that's why aku
that's why I said tadi ah I was telling myself I said you know if I could turn back time
actually kan aku rasa kalau aku tak break up dengan dia kan aku rasa kita dah ada anak seh dah kahwin because kita okay lah ya in that book right we actually wrote err when to get married and stuff like that we actually plan to get married when kita twenty seven tau twenty seven years old so kau imagine
or at least two kids seh ya so sekarang macam aku dengan dia both
plans pun tak work out
I mean I've been wanting to do that actually but I just telling I was just telling myself like jangan main gila jangan main gila
but I think aku dream about him because I've been looking at his instagram story
err that time I found out he just putus tunang actually he's a very private person tau because that time he tunang then he didn't post his tunang face
so it was like dia tunjuk okay ah okay err yang gambar ni aku tak tak nampak because back then aku tak follow him yet but it was my friend lah who showed me that picture so it was like just a picture of a bouquet of flowers and a ring so ya lah to show that you know dia dah tunang
but recently yang kita met back tu at a wedding
aku aku random ah aku tanya dia eh mana tunang kau
oh dia macam oh err takde ah
then that's when I know he dah putus tunang
but I don't know whether he's seeing anyone or not because takkan aku nak cakap dengan dia eh kau seeing anyone ke tak you know like
actually macam aku fikir balik kan it's amazing how I remember all my exes punya birthday
kan aku I don't know what's wrong but I remember his birthday so I was thinking like mm maybe ada ada ada ada tu eh
mm ada lah end of january
ya so we'll see lah we'll see maybe maybe I will just like ask him ke like hey wanna grab a coffee
okay nanti nearer to his birthday kau remind aku this ah
because aku takut I will ask him the question instead
ya hopefully hopefully because like macam next year kan dia dah turn thirty kan
ya so like bila dia turn thirty tu orang cakap wiser a bit lah it's like throw away your twenties and then start thirty with something new
eh nanti kan dah habis just tekan yang tick tu tau
lepas ni I can't wait to eat our sushi
how can you forget dia kat depan jer seh

because like uh the wood banyak tapi macam macam uh the besi is steel kan dia orang kena mine
ah so that's why like uh kalau kayu kan senang dia chop jer lepas tu dia dia process
kan cepat habis dia punya plank tu banyak
sekarang macam dekat dalam news kan dia kan ada banyak cerita macam climate change ayah dengar tak cerita ni
macam dia cakap oh dia ada ah perubahan alam
ah dia ada tukar macam oh ada tempat ni kadang kadang mula mula ah you know there's a lot of snow then suddenly eh tempat tu tak banyak snow
oh yang itu ada ah
so kalau macam ayah
ayah rasa yang ada perubahan tak over the years eh yang in singapore do you feel any changes or not
in the udara ke or anything like that
so ayah rasa macam tak apa ah kalau dia lagi banyak shopping centre then
this climate change tu kira kan boleh boleh adapt ah
tapi ah so far ah ayah tak tahu anybody yang got this COVID right
so ah pada ayah macam yang this ah COVID ni ah ayah think will last how long
tapi dia orang cakap mm dia orang cakap mula mula it comes from china kan because like dia punya china tu dekat situ kan
dia orang ada dia orang they like to eat a lot of like macam weird weird punya animal tahu
oh so macam ayah fikir actually what the government want is to make to ensure that people will continue working
ayah baca tak yang there's this uh group of people kan yang dia orang army plane habis lepas tu dia orang
ah dia orang fikir oh never mind lah because it's a private plane habis dia orang turun kan lepas tu yang eropah punya
the europe punya people say eh ah don't come because you're from ah please go home
ah ayah baca tak
oh ya dekat dekat eh the inside of the dormitory kan it's really uh it
according to my workers ah dia orang cakap kalau kau daripada ah but unfortunately lah kirakan kalau you're from china eh yang the
bangladeshi and the indian worker right don't want to mix dengan yang chinese because dia orang cakap tapi memang betul dia punya hygiene level is very low so
they try to okay I want to stick to only my people ya tapi sekarang is like tapi of course in the news I think singapore they don't want to say which
place or which type of which race is the one that is get a lot of the uh sickness because if not then people will be very macam macam racist kan dengan dia orang ah pasal tu dia orang pun tak nak ah actually
do you remember the SARS actually not so bad kan macam aku I I I don't remember cause I I was actually in like early like secondary school and then ya
oh is it abang abang punya party
oh the the khatam quran party is it
oh I don't remember kena check temperature actually
oh dah boleh clear ah
tapi ayah rasa like is this COVID right is it the worst thing that happened to singapore or actually ada benda lain in yang ayah ingat ah that is the worst thing than this COVID
so uh apa tu jadi if now eh bila ayah tengok macam movie movie macam zombie zombie kan
ah ayah continue tak tengok cerita macam itu sekarang kan now you feel like you're already in the movie
ada cerita yang paling takut tak what story is like super takut yang ayah ingat sampai sekarang ah
tapi that cannibalism is not even fake seh it's not it's not like zombie
but in the story kan dia orang macam cepat gila kan like the they the they run you know
orang hantu apa seh itu
oh so you're actually like actually the actual human yang human yang betul lagi lagi takut daripada
so macam hantu biasa macam ah you can just
walk away ah katakan
tapi kirakan sekarang ayah dah retire kan so ayah rasa freedom tak macam
I I don't need to care about like all this you know hantu or all these you people
so ah apa tu jadi bila ayah dah retire so after dah you retire you feel like
do I really need to go back to work ah macam gitu
so ah apa itu bila dulu kan ayah
um mula mula start kerja then you said that the kan ayah ada kerja kat tempat glass kan
ah so dulu dekat singapore dia ada banyak factory eh pasal I don't think sekarang ada company glass dekat singapore
dia punya cerita semua sama eh kena retrenched ah
macam kirakan fated ah
so sekarang kirakan macam free and easy
ah then everyday bangun and then just macam
uh buat itu ah uh if there's planning today then just buat jer lah gitu
so ayah rasa macam hidup gini all the way till the end okay ke tidak
so kalau actually eh macam sekarang kan dia banyak gila technology kan
ah ayah rasa technology ni kirakan macam bagus ke tak bagus kadang kadang macam technology ni macam
susah kan nak cakap
dulu ayah favourite subject apa eh like when in school lah
so bila ayah when you read kan those kind of stories kan do you feel macam actually bila dia jajah satu country tu dia bagus ke um good or bad
so bila dulu uh kan yayi is actually malaysian right
oh yayi
oh actually so pasal tu nyai will come to singapore
so tapi yang that time yang yang yang apa tu the the separation kan
dia dia announcement ke apa
so it was actually senang gila seh
oh so actually you got lucky ah kirakan
so actually macam ayah pun tak march sangat ah kirakan
actually dulu pun like when I first err fikir kan like what to do kan actually I also wanted to join uh the army
because like the army macam to me macam dia semua macam easy ah kan
ah then lepas tu you you you can rise up the rank and then kerja dia macam not so bad lah
tapi aku tengok macam orang kat dalam army pun macam apa tu stoning kan dia orang ikut the rules and then
ah macam pelik kan it's like what what what's it for ah but I mean I can maybe understand lah dia orang semua nak untuk buat
like you're disciplined tapi there must be other ways to be disciplined also right
macam somehow dah kau dah kau dah tak dekat dengan situasi itu suddenly everything macam not so bad
quite positive kan ah macam oh you can remember the good times ah
ah it it like life is like that kan macam dulu like apa tu err that time when the adik dalam police eh oh my god sia
like so hot and then lepas tu dia punya push up don't say ah
ah dia punya push up dah apa tu wah sekarang sekarang nak buat push up macam gitu pun tak boleh seh tapi dulu wah you know so good you know
ah and then lepas tu dia orang and then dia punya army officer semua cara dia sama kan
ah dia
muka kirakan semua macam yang itu ah yang kak inah tak minat
so macam dia orang semua nak kena they have this macam angkuh punya muka ah eh
ah tapi tak tahu ah maybe it's just not fated ah that I you know that I didn't join the army ah forget it sia tengok
a'ah tapi bagus juga seh kalau hari hari pakai uniform senang seh like you don't need to think you wake up
ah so macam kawan adik sekarang dia dalam MINDEF kan so like although he's in construction eh
dia nothing to do with him you know eh whatever that happen outside eh dia macam oh okay
macam MINDEF kan is very big so kalau dia orang if there's anything eh dia orang nak kena buat
ah in within the MINDEF itself ya dia orang mesti nak ada manager yang kat dalam yang boleh buat construction
macam ya like no feeling to scared ke takut ke kena buang kerja nothing ya
tapi ayah dah err I mean like I you speak to them sekali sekala ah at least
apa sal ada banyak secret ke
so mesti kerja yang rabak rabak punya then uh too bad lah because like you're in warehouse pe
actually ayah dulu ada license apa eh
ayah ada license forklift kan
ya lah macam wasted money ah pasal call crane
ah lah pasal macam sama ah macam construction kalau ada crane masuk kan it's like oh my god seh
like dia orang semua like you cannot even walk there and then ya
ah actually servicing kebanyakannya is really buang habuk
dia dia buang habuk jer lepas tu nanti is if if really something wrong kan
ah dia cakap ah change part jer ah semua
maybe pun tak gerak seh pasal there's not much things kan sekarang
ya so sekarang macam the situation dengan si COVID ni is a bit weird kan pasal banyak benda macam just stop
pun pun tak ada banyak orang pakai apa sekarang kan macam like ke apa tu yang the funny thing is that yang adik berbual dengan kawan adik ah habis kawan adik cakap buat apa nak beli baju baru seh
ah is aku I don't even use the baju half of the time in pyjamas macam I pergi kerja pun pyjamas ha
dulu kirakan macam so bila ayah dah masuk warehousing tu then lepas tu like you didn't bother to go back to the shipyard lah kirakan
ayah tak pakai itu ke umbrella
so it's like macam after you get out kan macam lain gila kan macam
itu ah kerja actually macam technical officer is actually pretty ah dia dia actually quite senang
a'ah so itu ah so tengok ah maybe adik pun will just become a technical officer ah
pasal kau if like you kerja all the way construction
is like lagi senang nak check orang punya kerja kan daripada nak buat you punya kerja sendiri
ah itu lah dia tapi actually sekarang kan dia orang banyak yang ah banyak
dia orang suka just berdiri and then suruh orang lain buat they don't want to go down themselves
itu yang masalah dia ah itu yang banyak yang macam singapore punya manager ah yang susah
I mm so you're saying like dia tak tahu ah actually
actually that's true ah itu yang dia punya the difference kan I think we talk about this before yang macam if you work for a
ah if the kalau dia punya engineer turun kan daripada australia ke apa then kalau kau tak turun dengan dia kan
ah then dia macam tengok engkau hello I'm going down sia you not going down meh gitu a'ah
ah tapi kalau macam singapore punya wah clean ah berdiri jer kasi yang the poor bangla eh ah
a'ah tapi tu tapi sekarang bangla semua pun tak ada
pasal sekarang pun dah ah semalam I met my friend
dia cakap on construction site kan cuma ada enam belas orang
adik cakap construction kau kau buat apa seh pondok
sixteen people to finish one construction wah bila masa nak habis sepuluh tahun pun tak habis
aku rasa a'ah satu swimming pool habis dia cakap no no no no I need to to build a school
habis adik cakap habis adik cakap dia punya school ni
dah setengah jalan ke or baru start baru start seh
tak cukup ah ah habis dia orang cakap ah they keep saying eh macam oh ah they giving green light green light
tapi yang green light ini actually belum
uh still go to the construction site mostly all cannot ah itu dia punya problem ah
ah so ah itu yang I don't know when to finish ah dia punya project habis dia orang kita so macam sixteen eh
habis kau imagine eh macam nak carry benda tapi nak kena distance uh tak boleh kan very weird lah dia punya rules
ah tapi tak tahu ah ini bila nak habis kan mm so tengok ah macam mana
tapi apa tu ayah ayah tengok tak yang macam yang dekat america banyak orang tak nak pakai mask
tapi pelik kan I don't know why macam dia orang err apa tu really really go against err apa tu dia ah nak pakai mask ni padahal pakai mask tu macam tak ada apa apa per
ah I don't know ah when when is this going to end pun really not sure
ya so tengok ah apa tu harap harap everything is okay lah kan
so tak tahu ah tengok ah macam mana habis mummy tak cakap apa apa ke
yang pasal yang macam COVID ini ke apa
ayah ada berapa banyak seh
wah dah dah dah planning ah
chey pasal dulu kan apa tu kan susah kan nak dapat singaporean
ten years tak boleh masuk malaysia apasal eh
so is apa untuk tunjukkan like you're patriotic ah kirakan
oh so dia dia really macam nak uh apa tu
tapi kalau macam if you go back kalau then you must take some some
letter ke atau pun macam tak atau they just tak tak tak consider you as patriotic ah
oh so kirakan macam apa tu dia dia really control lah ya
mm habis nyai is nyai singaporean
so dia bila dia convert seh
oh on the independence day itself dia boleh convert tapi apasal ayah tak convert
macam there is something ah to show like you really want to be a singaporean lah
bila ayah first uh cakap that pledge eh tapi ayah ayah sekolah pun kat singapore so it's not that hard lah
ah yang itu actually adik pun kena buat lah benda tu oh zaman zaman silam kan a'ah
ah up to you but preferably uh mungkin tiga ah three
okay okay understand okay and the next question will be what was the most memorable meal yang you ever had where did you actually have it
makan apa-apa ah macam kau pernah pergi overseas apa semua kan
but but was it like you say makan dengan ramen was it like sashimi punya type or is it cook or
oo but then then um the you say mm makan whale kan
macam dia punya texture
so you wasn't you you're like tak pasti juga lah whether it's the it's the isi of the whale of the fats of the whale
uh next question if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life apa yang you will eat like what would it be
the four seasons or you prefer macam singapore punya weather
understand okay so uh when you are in tokyo or japan kan so err for the halal restaurants that you went cause I read somewhere lah in some blogs or articles right that even though for halal restaurants they do actually serve alcoholic beverages betul ke
tu lah that's why I I read at the apa halal travel blogs mm
mm okay tell me recently ada benda like
yes skills ah kira like macam
wah you know so much about this karate martial arts semua thingy
yes so like whatever you have paid for before kan kira macam pada kau when you think back apa yang
uh engkau rasa macam like apakah sesuatu yang kau harap benda tu sebenarnya boleh jadi percuma ah
okay then after that next question ee kita dah nak our time
kalau kita dah dah tak payah kerja ah
kira activities seharian macam apakah yang akan menjadi suatu penyeksaan jika dilakukan selama lapan jam berturut-turut I would say work but
activity ah macam like working out ke
ni interesting gila ni
ah self right like uh nasihat some nasihat what would it be
maybe time time kau poly ah
kira kau poly
okay baik okay let's start the things macam how's things on your weekend
ya I mean tadi ya I had to wait for my wife come back cause she just now in the afternoon you know my my kid dia tidur all the way so my wife ingatkan dia can go to the hairdresser and then just relax kejap lah
you know just have a relaxing hair trim err hair wash and then go for a relaxing massage and all that err because today is the last day of her annual leave of two weeks so she wanted before balik kerja eh jadi dia nak
dia nak one whole day just pamper sendiri saja lah so let her be and then by the time she came back then like this ah just nice also you err you also jadi to do all these things ya so K lor so everything's all right so far I think it's a peaceful day
err while I was also thinking whether we want to discuss regarding our tournament punya benda
exactly ya ya that's my idea pun I was also thinking about that actually
ya so ya I also err not been discussing my guys err all those you know my my my guys who I've been consulting with lah err those that were in the semua tu
so dia orang kata you know like is it they worry about that what exactly what you said how what is you know how will we get the sponsors to come when kita takde benda you know like you you there's no real cove lah
like everybody knows kita punya reputation tapi takde takde portfolio in this this sort of thing so they will also thinking why not maybe you hold a weekly event dulu
the weekly event and then just nice err earlier this week ada there's a league that is there's a new league a one V one that kicked off so dia punya format eh sixty four teams or sixty four players thirty percent of registration fee jadi first prize
fifteen percent the registration fee second prize five percent registration fee third prize so kalau kalau all sixty four players masuk dalam
prizenya tak banyak it is seriously tak banyak actually so the total registration fee will be it's ten dollars per person jadi the whole prize pool eh baru apa enam ratus six hundred and forty
six hundred forty dollars so thirty percent of that the champion is only gonna get tak sampai dua ratus dua ratus dollar pun tak sampai it's like one ninety one ninety two something like that and only the top three players get and this is supposed to be a league jadi kena main each other for like
so that's at least thirty two or sixty four matches jadi a a lot of the the response of the company semua tak nak main it's like eh it doesn't make sense ya it's only ten dollars tapi you know like it's nak you you enter that
only top three dapat menang apa-apa and then even the prize will not that great it's that it's not like one K or few hundred dollar it's just like not even dua ratus so banyak orang you know the dia orang tak suka lah all this thing ah so I was wondering but
maybe let's say like of the registration fees kan ninety percent these guys only did like not even half ah what is thirty plus fifteen plus five that's our forty five percent tak sampai setengah of the total registration fee so why not have we do something like that but for a one weekend thing only
or even one day just have one day saja and then err we have like a a what a tournament which we will cast fully we will make everything on our own because we can cast ourselves err ya and we can have it as as relax as possible no need to be so err what's that called
um so serious because we are our own clients apa
so you know there's kita we can just like borak have fun you know and then let the committee come in and then tell them ah look this is you guys gonna pay ten dollars okay but the more the more people there are the bigger the the the the prizes
and the winner is not just gonna go back with less than two hundred dollars ah because the prize pool we're going to have it like ninety percent we'll just take ten percent of the carts just for our time saja lah so even was at six hundred dollars let's say okay let's say we enter it at ten dollar
I I I entah eh I also don't know how many people have resgistered tapi the the response I get banyak orang semua semua kutuk ah critics semua kutuk top top white center
now semua kata you know ni apa apa benda what kind of nonsense is this you know buat apa kita main buat apa I mean we play so much habis duit sikit saja then kena main lama lama how many weeks ya lah ada better things to do ah than to just stay around and play FIFA like that for for nothing at all ya
no tak tak tak nampak lain ah ada apa eh let me see kalau ada league there's a link here ya it's a facebook page
namanya D to sports league entah siapa I langsung tak pernah dengar aku tak pernah dengar dia orang punya ni tapi ada nine hundred plus members kat dalam
let's see ada tak berapa berapa orang dah sign up tak ni tak nampak pula eh
tapi nampak macam masih buka jer masih boleh sign up jer
a'ah berapa orang
ah belum tahu ah berapa orang ah kat dalam
tapi ya so this is one thing I saw where I noticed somebody's shared this on this err whatsapp community group page for FIFA in singapore so semua orang kata like
so there wasn't even any one they say alah just go for the fun of biar jer langsung takde orang say that semua semua kutuk okay I'll I when I say semua eh it's literally there only like three people that response ah that responded
yang lain semua you know buat buat tak kisah saja
ya this this this D to D thing it's just like a cash grab ah dia orang just buat ni benda just err make a few posters bilang semua okay eh aku ada league ah you know you get thirty percent kalau kamu menang you get thirty percent
tapi fifty percent of all the registration fee goes to the creator and they barely have to do anything benda senang I think there's just one guy doing everything it's a good business idea but it's a little bit
macam gray macam makan makan makan sendiri ah makan all the community
in terms of like I say getting the players I have no doubt we can get more than fifty players at one go that's that's definitely for sure even if it's just a one off event semua kan minimum or I think we can do a uh forty a thirty forty players so takde issue langsung ah
itu pun susah juga kan so I'm so I'm thinking at least kalau kita have a league a weekly league system thing then it will just err macam mana kata eh
every week ada content baru that we can we can put in and there's a there's a linking story between each of these different weeks
actually nak kata possible eh
it actually is possible actually because you need okay let's let's take everybody at once ah actually nak kata registration fee selalunya berapa
because they're by community centre budget no problem untuk dia punya wang actually it's free registration dia orang tak payah bayar apa-apa
so it's just my masuk lah kan but that's for the punya lah um ya but even then I still believe you know people should pay a nominal amount and also that they will be they will come down and play juga then noticed we won't have so many buys and stuff like that lah
tapi for all the events um what ah who ah they don't really need to recoup anything whatsoever they just dia orang just bayar bayar bayar jer so takde registration fee takpe juga untuk dia orang ya but for us we add in lah as much as we want to we are we are okay with
uh how do I say ah ya we need a way to pay or displays but but I at the same time I don't want to have a registration fee that's too high and then people will think alamak one day registration fee sepuluh ketul and then who knows you know like I play one game and then I'm out
I'm thinking what we can definitely though okay put it this way err let's say registration fee let's say lima ketul lah I I can definitely okay
the more people that join your prize pun naik gila babi
uh one hundred sixty dollars time zero point zero five that's eight dollars back you win one match kau dah menang tiga dollar
ah duit datang balik tau all you need to do is win that first match you going back eight dollar you pay me five dollar win one match I pay you eight dollars back
dah eighty percent eh a'ah sia tu dah banyak juga tu
soon lepas tu kalau dapat masuk to the semi final top four ah
err so five percent each lima peratus satu orang lima peratus okay naik top four
ah kau dapat sepuluh percent lah sepuluh peratus ah
correct so you masuk kalau you masuk quarter final sudah dapat five percent you masuk semi final you get ten percent
you masuk final up to fifteen percent
err mana percent yang
kejap eh so that's twenty percent plus okay and then the next four eh the next two okay four winners get twenty percent total alright naik four two will drop out now they get ten percent each so that's another twenty percent of the prize pool dah removed
two were good carry on the second place get fifteen percent the last place get twenty percent all by itself so that two four six seventy five we are still within we are still within err apa tu
correct correct we can even up the champion to thirty percent pun boleh thirty percent of the total prize pool
matchmaking pun susah ah ah ya so so that's the thing ah then the list uh ya uneven
ya eh kalau tak some people get a buy then they get their money back eh that's not fair juga eh
thirty two fairly I think eh no problem senang
senang ah senang
ah tu ah
I have okay like even without all this this new tournament thing kan I have another place to pitch our original league idea too but I've been holding it off um so that hopefully we can get our own uh third party sponsors ah takde orang akan kacau kita lah
falls the one that is working with SCOGA ah cause dia pun dah dia sendiri nak buat community events sendiri juga
my understanding is that he has his own production punya house or something like that
and I think at this his if we go to him for sponsor or whatever like that kan we telling him that eh looked operations side kita semua dah settled everything kita dah dah fikir masak-masak and kita boleh you know bawa orang-orang confirm register punya
you know tapi the one problem kan that I can see is that if we'll go to him to look for sponsors that is definitely basically is a SCOGA event or is a SCOGA sponsored event SCOGA duit no problem this is definitely their alley they were one more err jet ideas
that is what N nadesan has been saying ah kalau duit anything with money ke apa kan with gaming related SCOGA budget no problem that sounds SCOGA can afford kita
tapi so that's that's the thing ah we will be working you know like uh together with SCOGA it won't be our event eh technically it will be our event but will have their name on it as well
semua ya cause ya they have SCOGA but I remember they also it's it's almost like zenway lah actually ya supported by SCOGA supported by zenway but organised by you know like ah people association entah apa community club lah sports club
south west ni semua so it's it's it feels very zenway like
ya even this err apa dia E delta league
I don't know macam mana dia orang nak buat aku pun tak tahu lah eh tapi organised by singapore police force national crime prevention council
supported by tote board pizza hut blah blah blah venue partner sports up oh okay so it's gonna be an offline event ah kirakan ah kalau venue partner dah sports up tapi it's um ah you know like um it's again ah
so basically SCOGA eh in my opinion how they've been running all their events kan sama macam zenway sama
dia orang just buat the operations but they already have like sponsors will do all that so let's say we can put our branding there you know besides SCOGA
our venture punya logo whatever it is lah eh we're we're going to call it however going to design it there ya we'll definitely have that uh ya but SCOGA will definitely take a cut is one thing
ya and and that's a thing even I've been talking you know I've been talking to my wife ah technically she's the genesis of the initial idea of all these kind of having our own event dia tak suka the idea of kita um how to say ah handing over the rains to another person
dia nak kita hundred percent seratus peratus ni event kita bukan orang lain punya this is ours have our name over there for and then of this uh
you know orang lain tak boleh kacau ah senang kata orang lain tak boleh kacau
loudmouth partners loudmouth partner kita sure but it's not kita joined loudmouth and we we work under lock mouth
then they'll be like mana nama kau aku nampak nama SCOGA jer nama kau mana
I said oh now we work under SCOGA mana bukti
kita tak tahu SCOGA kita tak boleh you know we cannot we have to take you at your word I don't know about that but if kalau kita boleh tunjuk on a poster that has our logo on it
dia orang tak boleh cakap apa-apa ah they there's proof that says we are the ones that take all this we're not we're not the what ah err we are not not just mere partners or whatever kita tak buat apa-apa but
kita yang run the show
so that's why it's important to have our entity separate we can work together with SCOGA with ah whoever but they have to be partners it's not kita join dia orang we work under their name
satu orang kena start dulu ah senang kata
tu tu yang juga eh that
and then why I also tak nak like you I know you you said quite a number of times we're not you know I can put you can put your own money inside semua
tapi there there would seem a little bit of a chip ah then when like let's take your scenario you said you know we go to sponsors and then sponsor kata okay so siapa yang sponsor your previous event uh and then you say football academy and all that junior football academy
I tengok eh ini kau punya company apa
ah ha ha ha tu yang problem juga
but I think I would okay nak kata our community eh okay now to think about it objectively the positives that can come if you were the sponsor is that you know like throughout the entire days cast you know like we will have you know like um
I macam mana nak kata uh ada orang kata a lot of times at people sponsor benda kan they don't actually get anything much out of it
junior apa junior what
I think ya I think in the end tu nak buat sponsor tag ah in the end
you know macam mana eh I don't even know how to sponsor that looks like I've never seen one before though so I don't know what to base it on
we can actually do that actually if we were to look at because right now dekat facebook eh all the videos kan it will show how many views ada ada ada rather it will show how many views actually
ah what we we won't see total views we won't see how many concurrent views lah apa lah itu semua tak ada um ya even okay right now zenway is live right now sekarang ada berapa orang ni sekarang ada lapan belas orang lagi tengok some mobile legends punya benda
ya but I don't see any total views belum lagi belum lagi total views but let's see if I can load a previous show
previous show berapa eh let me see another video
ah tapi the problem my my midnight punya shows ah
one play sports videos the problem with semua malam-malam betul ah paling awal pun pukul sebelas tu yang problemnya
ada ada orang but it's not that much ah okay ya I'm looking here
mm asia champions league semalam nine hundred views err asia pro league which was on midnight five hundred views
one hour juga ni semua one our cast
but that was the the very first punya lah I mean like it was the first
err but they split it into different parts ah macam part one first two hours ten ten K views
quite quite a bit this four lah but then again eh E sports ada berapa berapa followers ni E sports how many followers
aiman will help out also and in fact if at all possible I would like to ask iman pun can we stream it on your stream
or even better if we can get we can rope aiman in as a commentator juga lah
you know I I can we make but then fees and all that lah like how sia macam mana aku nak you know send prize money it's not that's the only reason why I'm not opening it to outside singaporeans I don't how to send prize money to you
jadi kalau kalau if there's a way eh for us to go meet aiman I'm very sure he will love to work with us and I think kalau kita bilang dia look kita ini kita semua eh kita will ini kita punya event we're not getting paid
maybe we need to pay more stuff you know to add on to the prize money ah so maybe kalau dia dengar tu eh the hope is that he might be able to if he's free on that day firstly because now dia ada banyak banyak event kan
jadi kalau kalau a'ah sia dia banyak events ah so I don't know what he was bitching to us about lah jadi honestly I was like dude ini it like it ah I look I know you're disappointed E piala malaysia of fucking meeting ah err bullshit I just said ah sorry
but you are getting lots and lots of quantity ah you're winning quantity wise those two guys eh other than E piala malaysia apa lain dengan other dia orang takde benda satu benda pun takde benda
ah lepas
tak tak takde benda sia I can't I ah
okay I know that err see siapa ni matthew eh has uh has uh some malaysian cold wrestling thing or whatever there's a totally separate community it's a totally separate thing dari bola tau so you know ah oh kalau nak kata streaming bola jer
dia orang takde benda sia decipher lagi takde benda at least matthew involved in that wrestling thing whatever decipher langsung aku tak dengar apa-apa tau
so ya so he said oh I lost out to them honestly ah it's just connections ah you lost tau on connections ah that you just didn't have anybody that's inside whoever's doing this E piala malaysia thing that's the only thing but you're winning in everything else you lost one event so what that's it is just one event
because I know he's been doing singapore events juga
it's just to tell future potential customers look our our chapalang event tak ada sponsor takde apa takde benda
us sepuluh ribu views tau
you know err ya I also can tell it you know ah definitely when I when I let know of my community err this this affinity whatsapp group semua that's guaranteed a you know a number of views as well
ya let's say they're nah ya this is the one major stumbling block kita ada ah aku aku pun tak tak takde ideas ah apa nak buat like to find my own third party sponsor semua takde idea langsung ah
and he's not like any of my friends like have like companies or err what ah macam macam kau dan aku yang yang my friend hafiz the one that's you know that always leaves comments regarding commentary and stuff like that kan
I broached either to him by eh nak sponsor kita tak you know this sort of event then kalau kau betul-betul managed to get them in eh aku bagi kau you know some some credit or whatever lah some kickback lah so dia kata
won't see anything unless there's a global outrage dia orang tak langsung tak support local which is a lot of ya a lot of companies do that also ya timing also another issue right now a lot of companies are trying to tighten up their purses not spend more
officially eh looking at their website eh dia kata ah they are a youth non profit organisation
kalau nak under official words ah
um ya they have err few initiatives lah all this err E sports academy campus game fest campus legend so ya err and they let see apa lagi dia orang ada eh about us
uh ya so apa ni executive committee

terlupa err yang saya sudah apa membakar cupcake itu di dalam oven saya tidak mendengar saya saya tidak mendengar timer dan ia hangus
err then saya saya amat terperanjat dan juga berasa serba salah kerana sudah membazir cupcake itu
uh uh kawan kerja saya ah
err terkejut juga then menegur saya uh supaya uh saya tidak melakukan kesilapan itu lagi
ah betul kakak telah uh mempelajari untuk mengikut arahan dan jangan bertindak uh sendirian jika tidak pasti kerana kadang-kadang kita apabila kita rasa kami kita
um mungkin kakak ingin err belajar dalam bidang mengajar uh early childhood kerana saya suka berbual dengan uh anak-anak kecil dan juga ingin mengongsi err ilmu yang saya telah pelajari
err pernah satu incident apabila saya di kedai sedang ingin sedang menunggu
sedang apa um mengambil air sambil menunggu saya ternampak seorang budak sedang memain dengan bottle like yang
ia ingin flip bottle itu then
mahu uh ingin bottle itu uh berdiri dan budak itu um err melihat saya dan ingin mengimpress saya dengan dia punya skills then saya saya hanya senyum dan melihat uh adik itu dan um
uh mengatakan syabas kepada dia like good job because dia dapat flip bottle itu dan dia dia berusaha berusaha sehingga dia dapat stand bottle itu
um ya um apa apabila uh
anak anak kecil err um senyum ketawa saya gembira
um memang betul uh susah nak jaga budak-budak kecil sebab kita pun dulu budak-budak kecil tapi kalau kita orang
dah minat dengan err example bidang early childhood um
uh kita haruslah apa um kalau kita ingin tahu macam mana nak jaga anak-anak kecil ini kita boleh belajar dalam bidang early childhood kita belajar untuk uh cara untuk handle um budak-budak kecil ini
dengan but apabila sudah banyak kali uh practice err training
err cara tahu cara technique untuk berbual dengan anak-anak kecil uh yang agak mudah mudah juga
ya um sama seperti ibu bapa juga sebab uh jika we jika kita mengatakan uh mereka
err ada anak then dia orang apa kena um mengatasi masalah itu juga err untuk menghandle anak mereka
um teknologi boleh menjadi err boleh ada faedah dan juga tidak berfaedah err yang faedah dia
macam dalam pelajaran uh um cikgu boleh memberi assignment kepada murid-murid um err contohnya kalau ada E learning
um anak-anak muda um
murid um dari dari um muda mereka senang untuk catch up um their skills especially in technology
mereka senang untuk uh belajar macam cara nak menggunakan teknologi dengan mudah
dan mereka juga boleh err learn new skills from the internet because um but
yang keburukan teknologi pada anak-anak muda ini err ialah social media um mereka boleh terpengaruh dengan
err perkara yang di luar yang trend yang yang mungkin boleh membahayakan diri
err contohnya seperti uh ada seorang celebrity
mereka melakukan trend uh yang mungkin boleh membahayakan dan apabila anak-anak muda melihat itu mereka rasa mereka juga ingin melakukan
ingin menunjuk-nunjuk kepada rakan rakannya lalu melakukannya um tetapi ia boleh wujud juga membahayakan dirinya
err dengan itu saya rasa social media err technology haruslah digunakan dengan sebaik mungkin
ah untuk anak-anak muda jika mereka tahu cara untuk mengguna technology dengan baik mereka uh uh techonology ialah perkara um it's a safe platform for them
um ya kakak ingat dulu bila kita kecil um kita dulu kita orang uh
usually entertain diri sendiri dengan menggunakan komputer dan ada ada game permainan di komputer dan kami err main sebanyak mungkin ia juga agak menarik
err tetapi uh kami sebab kami
err ada adik-beradik kan uh kami kena ambil giliran
dan kadangkala kami gaduh pasal err giliran siapa untuk memain game di komputer
kami juga um uh di kami melihat err cerita dalam err pada zaman dahulu lah tapi zaman sekarang uh kami tidak pakai lagi kami boleh tengok online saja
ia memudah untuk generasi muda sekarang um ya

okay that's the thing cause if you asking about my dreams cita-cita saya nak pergi ke australia untuk continue my studies which actually I was supposed to do but then I did not cause family time I was thinking about keluarga masa dengan keluarga sangat important
pasal kalau ibu um susah sangat kalau dia nak lepaskan saya cause saya anak yang paling last
so for ayah
ayah is quite easy you know
you know but like when I was supposed to go saya not supposed to come back for like two or three years that's why you know the risk of family time is important to me so that's the thing that's the answer for that
so tak boleh yang typical macam invisible
oo tu susah
okay awak awak jawab dulu
okay awak nak jadi macam spy kids lah
mmhmm masukkan makanan dalam oven terus boom dah siap is it
awak tak sangka kan tu jawapan saya saya tahu saya tahu
iya lah
as you got wow now after we think ya masa tengah fikir ni
allah ada timing eh okay
ten years ago saya dapat jumpa sekarang
kan yang benda tu dapat jumpa sekarang okay
ya pasal saya suka collect gambar-gambar lama
ya sama macam ibu collect collect collect
mm tiga belas ya
saya tengah secondary one
a'ah macam jer cause
ah cause after second year third year habis
sama-sama lah kita macam
nak buat kawan susah lah
tak buat apa-apa pun ya pasal kita pun tak boleh pakai telephone
ya tapi saya tak boleh tidur often it's cause
uh student leader saya student leader
ya saya student leader
tapi in your secondary school
sekolah yang paling tinggi cause my school is more of a like a music school
siapa yang suka first of all
ya saya kena um bully about my looks
macam compared to primary and secondary secondary school
I prefer primary school just cause dia macam carefree at that point
right you macam tak kisah
pergi sekolah tak pergi sekolah macam it's okay
dalam sekolah apa eh
saya paling suka during saja
makanan is
simple makanan simple
like it's cause tak mahal
nak cakap murah pun tak murah sangat but
kau pergi east kan
jawapan saya is the dua dollar
dekat dah tak ada dah nak cakap innalillah pun tak boleh innalillah dah takde
dah tutup it's cause before I graduate I heard that uh they were running out of money to survive in that stall so they had to close the stall cause stall tu dengan bubble tea I ingat
saya tak fan
itu yang belakang drink stall eh
ya I remember I asked them before maggi apa dia orang pakai just cause
nak try buat kat dalam kat rumah
macam tak boleh make it tak tahu
saya rasa saya chef bob awak rasa
awak chef wan saya rasa saya tak mampu
and you know me apa-apa you kasih I I makan jer
I tak tanya apa benda saya makan jer
inshallah benda tu halal inshallah tu halal
oo soalan yang susah
wow sensitive question dia
uh waktu secondary school kan
wow I know I am I macam macam-macam lah since ah macam macam macam dari primary school it's if primary school I
it's like netball sama dia punya rules is sama macam netball
exactly the same cuma dia punya um the hoop is not the regular basketball hoop or netball hoop it's a trampoline like a vertical trampoline you have to throw it
ya very complicated tapi saya buat and then I also did
um benda ni saya tak akan lupa selama-lamanya
I nak beli air
cause it's recess time of course saya nak beli air so I pergi canteen seorang-seorang
beli air terus ada this random girl came
and then I look at her cause I macam lost kan apa seh dia ni berbual
saya tengok dia I macam huh and then she was like cause you sound like a man are you sure you never went to surgery before
okay after that selepas itu dia buat lagi and lepas tu dia buat publicly
dia depan-depan orang you know but after she did that she walked away eh no and then she said uh pretty sure you did surgery before and she walked away
saya macam tercungap tu kan so I tak tahu nak buat apa
so I just masuk dalam kelas balik then I macam just doze off cause
ya and then as the day goes by it gets worse cause like I got bullied online last time kalau you ingat like myspace blogspot was a thing
abeh macam tadi you cakap oh student
tak necessarily it's a good thing cause everybody knows you and they like to put things in each other's mouth just cause like I don't say it but they would say
I wouldn't say adulthood is like cause kalau adulthood we don't usually care about people right
if dia orang nak berbual dia orang nak berbual you know what I mean
but bila secondary school it's hard cause you have to
soalan apa susah lagi saya tak tahu macam mana nak fikir
just give myself confidence pasal kalau pasal saya insecure
and only if I had a bit of confidence to just kick out my insecurity saya rasa macam everything is gonna be okay
no saya pun tak tahu nak cakap apa
uh suka hati apa orang nak cakap saya percaya apa awak cakap
everything is susahnya soalan awak
bosan kan
agak bosan cause you're not content
so dia
saya rasa saya overthinker
you know I tukar jawapan I I actually nak cakap bali
bali balling tempat bali is everything that you
kita scared of height
conquer dalam bahasa melayu is
benda tu lah saya nak conquer saya nak conquer fear saya
saya really I'm really scared of heights
lagi rumah awak punya um yang wall tu kan yang kat luar rumah it's not like a sturdy one you know actually you know
paling worst is rumah kat toa payoh I tak tahu kalau you pernah pergi
rumah dia dekat toa payoh so like the
walkway tau it's senget so you're going down and the wall
uh the side wall it's actually very rendah like your
lepas tu I nak pekik apa tau
oo soalan paling susah lagi macam
muka macam sedih kalau tak pergi dengan awak kan takkan nak text awak babe tomorrow saya nak pergi dubai got ticket free
saya pergi um burj khalifa belikan awak
ya belikan awak
um kunci key chain right
dah tu jer lah saya mampu belikan untuk awak
makan banyak-banyak abeh sehari jer tapi dia hantar balik tak
tapi you tak tahu nak pergi mana
I tahu you
you makan jer dah memilih dah cerewet abeh you nak step
nanti dia kasih you makanan lain jer you macam
itu awak everything that you have been saying the genre it's you
mm you tahu I I tak suka movies sangat
tak tahu saya cuma saya suka falling in love the whole part of
like you get to know the person you fall in love you get a heartbreak fall in love just repeating the cycle that's me I really like it anything you tahu um nicholas sparks movies macam macam gitu favourite saya
movie dia banyak kali
tak bosan just
is cerita white chicks
itu favourite
I remember script dia semua
but tak tak macam seram ke
what's the craziest um cerita paling
yang seram I wouldn't say seram
konon macam alien ke apa ke mana tahu masih ada tapi kita tak pernah nampak
wow kita tengok banyak cerita zombie tau
so I think I don't like to think this kind of things saya tak suka saya benci fikir pasal gini
boleh anxiety tau ya cause
I think virus macam sekarang
sekarang kita COVID jer kan
although in singapore they only say like macam
I'm so sorry saya tak pernah saya tak boleh fikir lah sekarang tapi ya taiwan went to zero like really quick
actually we did though remember dulu kalau uh ada SARS
tapi SARS tak teruk macam gitu although enam tahun kan if I'm not wrong is it six years we had to go through but it wasn't like the whole world
cause I rasa
or yang bagus
ya awak ni pandai lah buat soalan macam gini
uh saya rasa
cause untuk kita macam tak ganggu kita asal kita nak kena fikir pasal benda gini
awak lucu lah um akhir hayat
awak jawab dulu saya kena fikir I'm a foodie
apa daging just daging
daging steak
taste awak mahal
awak pandai lah
sebenarnya saya nak cakap pasta tapi saya macam fikir pasal diri sendiri pula
ah saya buat pasta
sedih nah tapi sedih juga kalau hari-hari
okay awak pilih daging saya pilih ikan
both boleh steam
boleh grill boleh macam-macam
macam cara kita kan chef wan dengan chef bob
apa punya restaurant ni
kifarah lah pasal kita get
oo kifarah apa
kifarah kan dalam bahasa kita kifarah
uh saya rasa rasa
oo apa eh cause
you tak akan fikir buruk pasal tentang tentang diri you sendiri
you confirm cakap macam you baik dengan orang macam gini tapi saya rasa
sebaik kita ada buruk kan betul tak
saya buka main door
I think I buka I think a few times chey nak cakap saya baik eh tapi tak lah
I want to say good looks macam
uh awak nampak
like macam very presentable
kalau presentable dengan
I'd prefer oo susah kalau diri sendiri I prefer badan sihat
saya sekarang jer jalan tercungap-cungap
kesihatan kesihatan is everything
you nampak macam you muda tapi kalau you jalan sikit jer dah penat
asyik nak main jer
ya mak you muda eh
I know what you gonna say saya dah tahu dah apa awak cakap
dalam partner awak cari apa
oh no apa
that I'm not doing is eating I've been eating macam-macam saya makan lah saya tak
saya tak tengok portion apa saya just makan
ya siapa kisah
a'ah ada macam-macam baru makan
nanti seminit lagi saya um
to exercise tapi nawaitu saya is to exercise
saya gain weight
saya tahu awak saya kenal awak saya gain weight like crazy
badan saya kecil dengan saya nak cakap saya tak tinggi tak tinggi sangat lah but
sedang-sedang sahaja badan tapi kalau saya step on the weighing scale
I'm like fifty five apa ni saya macam
ini weighing scale yang salah ke saya yang bersalah
tapi ya
kawan-kawan dia macam oh my god huda
semua nak seh
macam gitu eh
so you nak maid lah
or is it you nak pembantu rumah
cause muka saya dah kering jadi saya macam insecure sikit
saya tak nak jadi materialistic
awak rasa macam oh dia orang ada ni
or dia orang ada ni saya tak ada
although awak ada apa yang dia orang tak ada awak tak akan
dah start lah then you just continue talking
apa like gold shop
oh okay that means if this COVID nineteen dah
is the laksa place still there there was a
mini laksa stall dulu-dulu ah when I worked at Equip
ya lah mak
oh the one yang mask tu is shah
mm mm ya because the the nama I always
your friends all nama sama-sama seh
err going P one dekat mana

I considered going there monday tapi must book in advance like don't have cannot just walk in gitu
tapi tu like you really paint stuff macam you see gambar and you just paint
I think they usually sorry lah to say but usually kalau put in extra hours they would usually pick the younger ones
but you know it's like it's so obvious kan kalau like the whole team come early tak apa juga
like there are other people who she feels better than her lah gitu
but I also think the the colleague yang nak leave tu like just try sebelum leave just try one shot like you think any possibility to increase my pay since I'm doing more you know that kind of thing then if really you cannot then just quit quit lor
maybe because you feel like aisle way corridor pun tak not safe
can check out art ground yang dulu whether they are open or not
kita tak boleh like impromptu tak boleh
kalau nak impromptu just go to any park
yesterday I was like telling oh dengar lah I don't know what's wrong with them I was like so intent one cause I got like

so saya jumpa kamu minggu ni okay
actually sekarang so far
I mean being in army like a lot of things already sudah restricted so
naturally we all sudah tak boleh keluar tak boleh go see our friends and all that so weekdays all aku pun tak free then
you know follow so that you know sekarang tak tak dapat saman kan ya
oh ya now is like the limit is wait is it still five or sekarang sudah buat sepuluh orang is it
actually if I'm not wrong now kalau wedding kan then we can have up to fifty people right
oh so sekarang means ikut shift ah dia punya macam wedding or like
oh cause from what I know is like next week I have a jemputan
cause from what they told me is that now only I think about lima puluh
the table sudah nak kena be err separated
kat your instagram story right pasal err the new system
you get certain score and all that then doesn't make you eligible to masuk like
if you understand then you can explain a bit lah macam
err cause both of us are going off field and all that then kat dalam hutan
sudah lah tak ada signal tak ada handphone pula
tak akan nak check news kan I mean news is legitly the last thing on my mind
just give me the opportunity to jumpa new people to interact more with err
tak wasted lah ya I really get to use it to
kalau if you ask me personally whether I would
give back more to the masyarakat
right I mean aku masih muda lagi
then what are the things like uh kau guys kau buat
what's the activities yang kau suka buat like say on a weekend lah ya
maybe go to the beach pergi jogging ke
okay pergi makan
cause I I I think I agree with you with that cause the moment you masuk camp
I think that's the one oh when my mum masak you know
like what my family suka buat kalau on weekends right is that
we usually try to make sure cause weekends is err bila everyone is
my adik and my mum they're free
err walking or cycling lah just around the area cause I stay err dekat dengan apa tu east coast
so kalau nak pergi beach pun err tak jauh sangat
kalau hujan lebat then okay lah that's when
make it like seimbang you know err just have a balance
kalau weekends you think about it you only have dua puluh empat jam
timing yang kita ada is definitely limited
kalau anything about pun I'm not so afraid to just bilang dia orang ah
eh last time dulu aku papa pun buat ini buat ini like last
ah dulu kalau nak pergi keluar nak kena march and don't know what
wait I I was also enlisted in tekong so jadi
my family also ikut pergi sampai tekong and then they all
mum and dad adik and my eh my adik
and my nenek my err makcik
then we went to the cook house then check the food then of course lah kalau first day kan
they all need to set a good impression for all the parents so dia orang give the best food lah that they have
then ah I remember that day wah boleh nangis seh
ah rindu lah haven't been so
all nyanyi-nyanyi right all bising-bising
no ours was ours dua belas I think
macam total check my financial spending ah and really pen down pen and paper what
think about it err the duit that I
err set aside for macam macam transport kan
then after that kalau transport there and back cause I don't know selalu aku take grab lah
err careful with the where you spend the duit lah
start menjimatkan wang lah uh especially now that
beli mcdonald's beli what all that it's just like
no no no tomorrow lah at the start then can go out beli baju kan
now err sebab all got the macam mana nak cakap the elections kan
cause err kalau you look at it right now
some of them like kasihan juga lah you look at them then they're like if they end up
err just buang all their duit during cause they ya our seniors ah
all buang their duit during then because of that when they they don't have as much then
and really err how to say err jaga your own money
I think for me like what you asked just now right uh tadi you said
cause definitely I really don't want to bebankan my parents financially lah and most of the
kalau extend contract kan jadi sampai cause
the idea is that err kalau we stay longer kat dalam camp
tapi mm tak tak sedap sangat
I mean tak it's not that bad
like uh tak jadi beban to your parents ah
tapi now
okay tapi now I feel like ya let's just talk about makanan ah really that's like my favourite thing to talk about
no I mean it's like sometimes it's like eh you want to go eat it's a it's a it's a it's not I'm not necessarily lapar or anything
tapi it's just a excuse for me to like
err jumpa kawan jumpa family
err eratkan silaturahim lah with people people that
like you say asalkan halal I'm steady lah
a'ah eh kampung food aiya nevermind lah bro
apa kalau kau beli rendang right it's like what one piece it's already like I I also don't know ah I think it's like three dollars at least
then worst is sotong
so you you buy sotong that time
bulan puasa then my family pergi geylang kan nak makan
nak okay not makan sorry nak beli untuk buka lauk ah
standard ah you'll pack away take away lauk right
call that err sotong right the
sotong hitam sotong hitam that was the big squid then it was like what
in my opinion ya sebab kalau lapar kan a quick fix
ya then sebab it's convenient
err stand in one row right then semua beli maggi then tambah telur
then the telur selalu macam tak masak apa the aunty will say eh setengah masak but it's like
obviously not cooked then we just kacau everything then makan terus
encik tan encik tan bro that's like the go to nasi
then after that it naik sampai berapa eh
sampai tujuh puluh lapan bro
there is no way right kau boleh belajar and study at the same time
ya is ya oh sorry makan dan belajar at the same time sorry
so jadi we had to make do with what we had then
usually kita beli what err just nasi campur
or the india punya makanan ah
what we had was what err nasi padang right
nasi padang and the asagani stall
oh do you remember when err dulu
when we used to beli the nasi goreng first right then we just ask eh ada nasi kway
cik ada nasi goreng ada kway teow goreng then she'll be like
eh ada ada okay okay err jangan bilang orang then we
suddenly it's like everyone knew what nasi goreng was
honestly it was I think it was a different type of nasi goreng I I don't haven't tried it outside yet
there's no nasi goreng that I've tried that does like that it's super spicy
hey it was a super spicy nasi goreng
bulan puasa bro
okay bukannya susah sangat
betul betul okay understand
I try to masak lah sometimes cause when I'm at home
especially when I got oh actually I won't say it's masak but I try to bake when I have the time to
ya some things I did was eh that time remember bulan puasa
I made err err suji for everyone
because tak boleh agak how much err ramuan you need right
and all the sukatan-sukatan all that was very obscure to me
and some are online recipe ya first time buat then they say eh
ya ya that's true that's that's very tiny tiny suji right
then sudah sudah sudah habis buat then dia punya what you call that
when I made the err the whole aduan right it was a bit
so when I tried to make kuih for the first time that's what happened ah then the suji came out
I stay in the east area then this amshar pula tinggal kat
apa woodlands kan jauh gila so obviously
nak naik train pun I took like one and the half hours so
wah memang but that day sempat lah
sempat sempat balik bedok by buka seh
cause I left quite late I remember oh then I stopped by ang mo kio I wanted to meet tok mat to pass him the suji then he gave me another whole
um what you call that a whole container of kuih tart in return so
what was it ah it was oh hari raya oh I was I had leave
ya is no bro is the eve of raya bro
eh tak boleh ah I got interview then I was like oh okay lah then I go to your house ah
nasib baik I remember where you stay sia
actually this kind of thing also honestly I a bit kekok but but why did the the baking thing was that
suji for myself it's just dah
tak masuk akal lah for me to eat everything oh what
ya for everything on my own obviously I eat one or two sudah a bit muak sikit kan
let's say kalau I'm outside kan then I see people macam
need help especially older people naik naik bus that kind of thing then angkat the bag all like go inside right
paiseh kan because if you think about it eh ah memandai jer nak tolong
then err obviously she understands that aku pun nak she understands that aku pun nak tolong dia kan
kalau the makanan kan is halal right it will be less
but then err aku pun tak nak susahkan dia orang right
ya ambil hati also then they also tak nak
eh actually I feel bad macam I I don't I
ah kari asam pedas bro that that nestle ice cream container got asam pedas
but tapi kalau you
ya but then err the my other halal option is uh mamak lah
mamak stall lah bro supper club
ah infomercials that's why there's kalau kau tengok jamaah kan one suria and all that
so obvious eh like eh ah abang
err susu biasa lah tak payah pakai
ha ha I think I see this most often about my nenek lah
ya they they I mean in general my nenek cooks everyday
for for starters my nenek is quite open to all this also
kan ada tetamu datang obviously you have to prepare something right for them
but because we sudah bawa makan
ya tak payah susah sangat
you know we used to beli ah sweet talk semua kat bawah block kan
ya only if you use like special discount ke
okay kalau sudah ada kahwin okay sudah kahwin pun boleh lah
ya masak tak akan hari-hari nak masak maggi
kau ambil train ke kau ambil
bro jangan kuat sangat
ya tak aku ingat kau jalan dengan kat sini
aku mimpi aku pregnant babe then the mimpi was so real is like macam kau tahu bila kau tengah give birth
ya I can feel the pain it's sakit gila babe
ya habis baby tu keluar babe I I don't know who is the father also but ya itu jer lah mimpi aku
err nobody ah it's just me and the baby and some other people that aku tak kenal
dia macam baby biasa I guess like anak perempuan habis cute tapi nakal ah habis dia minta susu dengan aku selalu
no leh it's more of like I have to jaga this baby
ya aku memang mimpi pasal baby banyak ah aku tak tahu apa pasal but in real life aku memang macam tak nak anak ah
mm ya lor but then aku suka budak-budak apa and I like to spend time with them but I don't know right ya yes
cause aku dulu suka buat macam that kind of like diary entry like from that year or whatever
very like ya reflective and macam gini
all right lah yang benda-benda bodoh ah macam
aku rasa aku masih dengan azee seh
so aku aku just dengan kawan aku aku remember ya about her and then like
ya lor but then um ya aku rasa
like are you still friends with that girl the kawan aku kan uh but like
but dulu sec four kau ada macam mimpi-mimpi eh impian-impian ke
see lah my english all berterabur already
mm I think very small things like kalau
orang tu macam tak text aku balik or what I think aku fikir yang bukan-bukan but then I aku macam don't act on it lah but sometimes I'll I'll be
even though you think maybe it's something personal but kau try to
a'ah satu hari tu kat bus aku tak tahu kalau kau ingat ke tak aku tweet pasal perempuan ni kat bus habis dia macam
tak nak jalan babe dia macam tak nak give aku way habis
in the end like dia tak nak duduk dia tak nak duduk tak apa tapi banyak seats kat belakang then bila banyak seats kat belakang aku geram lah macam apasal kau tak nak kasi aku jalan eh
and then me being passive aggressive aku macam
okay lah tak apa ah aku just diri habis aku jeling-jeling kat dia
then terus bila orang turun dia duduk dekat depan babe
at last dia duduk so pun tak apa
aku tak tahu maybe around like younger than me
she saw me she saw me and then dia macam nak buat macam you know muka yang macam
mm step tak nampak aku gitu
aku stare dia seh aku dah macam minah red aku dah keluar habis
habis what about you
aku rasa macam you're the least petty person ever
or like me zaman dulu lah because
ya ya bila aku dengan zee I mean like this girl nama apa eh nama dia apa eh aku lupa tapi dia kawan zee
then this girl dia macam tak nak tegur aku tak nak say hi even though I said hi to her so I don't know her personally what right
exactly it's because dia cakap ah apa ni aku date zee that's the reason why she don't like me even though I'm julie's friend
nasib baik buat apa call aku eh
dah lah it's okay lah don't have the red one lah
but then ex kau yang lagi satu
okay but if if I were to choose I think aku nak macam to be able to speak
and also kau boleh baca quran babe
I can play ah but sikit-sikit jer it's not like mastered level tahu ah
oh ya I got the semangat one
but kau tahu berenang
aku tahu float jer
err about james charles dia kan suka nyanyi tapi nyanyi dia macam tak sedap kan so he went to a vocal coach
allowance berapa lama ni
sixteen seconds bodoh bagus
siapa seh aku nak jadi I'm already an actor myself in real life I think normal
apasal seh
aku tahu tapi I didn't like
so it's like okay lah kan nothing wrong with that but I think because we older already so we don't really macam judge too harshly
like you wake up as them but you're still yourself rabak though then suddenly I can speak malay
that will make the news you know wah stray kids can speak malay one tiba-tiba
like tak payah pergi kerja ah
ya I think aku so
aku rasa aku kasi therapy ah
tapi are we allowed to talk about singapore like that
out of the boss gitu lah
itu lah
tapi kita tak tahu what type of zombie
gigi siol putih
tapi kau boleh tak dah hafal channel dah hafal cerita dah hafal script
dry and terkopek and already putih
ya you will lose melanin and then like kau jadi putih ah
hello what's up who can help me kau berbual kuat
imagine the engineer yang kita tak suka dia knock knock kat aku bila tengah tidur
sir uh I need to take ah bagus bagus kau balik kau berak full of shit
yes I have thought about it if like if it's others others eh if it's other powers I think it's like macam okay lah if it's like creative if it's like gini gini like I I don't need all that ah
so imagine you in a crowd you already rimas
then ghosts lagi-lagi hari-hari tengok kau macam eh and kau boleh nampak sia ke apa ee
I only know one guy dia boleh macam dia memang boleh nampak but dia and you can kind of see dia macam claus dia macam depressed dia macam mm ya
so macam kesian ah
but he's very like I think he has that since young lah so dia macam dah biasa in a way but
ya I know lah some of them macam they everytime will find an opportunity to just say eh kat belakang kau ada benda or whatever but I can tell lah that is fake lah
I think I tak tahu lah maybe dia orang gila ah nak attention but then why would you want attention that way
like I remember that time I met my boyfriend there and then he was like eh kau tahu tak boyfriend kau ada macam lembaga hitam dekat belakang dia then I was like
apasal eh lembaga hitam dia cakap dia ada something lah kat like his aura or something
ya it was like twirling like mario macam bagai
I was twenty twenty three he would be twenty dia nineteen eighty nine so berapa tu
uh he's the same lah tak ada apa-apa lah dia ex yang paling boring untuk aku

ya tak diplomatic you know
but I think her power is like memfitnah
kau dah sia

not working um working lah working from home ah err kira work from home
um ya lah basically macam bake cake ah kebanyakan bake cakes
then err lagi macam jual baju ada jual baju juga um
jual baju is on facebook live you've seen that facebook live before right ya so
I do like baking habis baking is like when people want to order from me they can just
contact me ah dekat instagram or carousell they can find me there and then
wait for them I will make lah pasal sometimes because I'm also like working part time as well like juggling three jobs at the same time oh my god
as of now sekarang ah I prefer baju jual baju
sebab um
baking and then macam very penat it's very tiring ah very tiring then I need err actual like
okay lah so I need actual kitchen dia macam tempat pun tak ada then
I love baking I still love baking but inshallah like in the future kalau if I have err a kitchen space then I maybe will continue back my baking is not I stop baking lah I'm still baking lah it just that now only once a month twice a months
will will apa maju english
um for now kan I sell facebook live sahaja kan so in the future I will do mostly like um okay how to I like attract more customer is it
live won't die off but if it does die off kalau dia die off kan um I already dah macam ada my customer base I already have I dah ada so even if the facebook live die off they can come over to my shop they already know my name my name is well known ready
I know which right now currently sekarang tiktok is doing it
tiktok has a live um ya tapi for one thousand followers and above
not in the future during the future I think it will apa banyak orang akan jual barang dekat tiktok
but ya the part ah the part where you said um body body builders pakai instagram is tadi cakap
actually it's true you know because I I don't know why I think it was back I was like really into those yang bikin body bikin body
ya kalau beli phone baru pun is better I feel like beli phone can buy camera apa camera yang good quality
that's why I also like planning to buy new phone juga with a good quality camera on the phone which I do not know tapi I kena find out lah
oh oh it got contract or just the phone itself oh oh I dengan contract I ada contract
no what I want to err what err err a a phone with camera sebab kan I cakap I ada facebook live kan
so I can take pictures of my clothes take good quality I mean sekarang I can use my phone to take good quality ah but it's not good quality it is just a picture which is nice but it's not a good quality picture
okay but my one I have no problem sekarang sebab I have microphone I have microphone
what sekarang my camera quality for me macam tak apa uh not bad okay cuma kena ada good wi-fi
connection if wi-fi connection is not good dia akan
so that's why sometime you see my video will be like macam err a bit not good quality sebab wi-fi connection wi-fi connection is important
like that is apa kena pakai wi-fi connection more daripada mobile data kalau mobile data bila pakai dia lagi rabak dia punya lagging
benda-benda yang I tak tahu I pun tengok youtube juga ya so macam ya because so come back to youtube juga of course tapi macam mana eh you nak jual baju dekat youtube
tapi I nak phone baru mainly sebab I nak ambil gambar of this baju yang I ada okay I'm not concerned about
the live punya video
apa live video quality I'm not concerned about that that much sebab so far all the phone kalau yang rabak pun dia punya quality is very good I'm concerned about pictures that coming out and gonna post it on my facebook
no lighting is a need as well tapi I really have lighting okay I already have lighting I just need to learn more
eye to see which one is nice which one is not ah you sendiri have to tengok sendiri lah mana satu yang cantik mana satu tak for free
you ingat photoshop senang you ingat photoshop senang
tak kenapa you cakap dengan I macam I tak tahu photoshop
kenapa you berbual dengan I macam I tak tahu photoshop
you talking to someone yang belajar photoshop so why you saying that guy that way
yang mop canteen mop canteen
you know what reminds me of my sekolah time sunrise sunrise sunrise kan a'ah sunrise
is a kitchen so you have to clean up our clean up is like thorough clean up as well um sapu
lepas tu mop lepas tu cuci all the pan pots all wash
no flour on it make sure there's no dust or flour it just like okay and then jap when you cakap macam gitu teringat macam oh okay macam sama kat sekolah aku pun sama bikin gitu
know the rubbish bin all that right err so kita again ah upper aside those ya not so basically we will most of the time we will ask like
um everyday we have our own leader you know everyday we have you know like if if if apa ni primary school ke secondary school prefect prefect secondary school
eh secondary pun ada eh
so like prefect kan macam everyday kita ada prefect dekat sekolah tu walaupun it's already a a
ikut dia punya register number something like that so it's not loser basically this person do right is like everyday dia akan assign like
okay the four of you will do the pots and pans the four of you will mop the four of you will do this ataupun okay the four of you will collect the ingredients the flour and put on top okay the four of you
there's a term for that we don't call monitor or president other term other term I lupa apa chef entah apa chef I lupa but I hate it when it comes to my turn
no I'm not I'm the most macam no um the most shy because like in the morning I have to be talking to all of them like as if like I'm the leader sia I have to talk like okay I'm the leader you guys have to listen to me I'm not that kind of person what I'm not
so macam bila part I jer macam macam mana ah macam mana ah everytime is my turn I will be like ah shit I'm so scared I'm so scared I will get like anxiety macam
panic uh macam mana macam mana but the hal is everytime dah dapat tau everytime dah dapat because it rotates what
even if I don't want to lead then I'll be like macam on lah very on very kiasu you know
tapi kan macam ini macam tak ada pilihan langsung everyday orang rotate orang yang ada yang lagi pemalu daripada I
yang very shy super timid ada that one also like
but that we as a as the dia punya classmate tak ada macam
wah this one wah rabak sia cannot sia cannot sia we don't kita akan macam
for for example lah nama dia michelle eh michelle we would encourage her would be macam michelle it's okay you tell me what you want me to do you tell me I sitting beside you you tell me
ya time sekolah that's why I really love at sunrise you know at sunrise it's like the most amazing school I mean okay maybe the school is not really amazing tapi I punya classmate is the most amazing classmate ever so I macam happy gila
time secondary school primary school jangan cakap lah paling merepek
huh okay part buli in singapore is not that rabak hmm kalau buli in malaysia is the most rabak eh
okay lah let him be lah okay I don't know what happen to him now it's been years already hopefully okay dah berubah
I still feel so stupid you know I'm like I'm I'm staying at choa chu kang tapi asal I jauh
I apply something at balestier I do not know why got the other one at balestier and then suddenly balestier ni pindah for the second year pergi dekat yang college central
hujung sekali kalau kelas you hujung sekali your canteen is hujung sini
to my defense I didn't know sebab bila I uh apa apply for this sekolah dia orang cakap oh this diploma is recognisable everywhere in singapore outside of singapore is recognisable wah but when apply kerja horrible
no they do not recognise ah apa private diploma singapore don't recognise private diploma even kawan-kawan I yang kerja
eh yang
yang apa yang M yang macam you know is private juga kan ataupun apa
entah lah that one private also kan that one also not recognise tau sebab private
tapi is like quite the amount is so much for a private but then end up you don't use my for you you korang bagi kerja korang tak nak accept
takde lah
takde lah culinary job is I understand
so I understand that part is like macam okay lah but then
so now you are saying like okay you do not know what is happening okay so I bilang
basically alah macam banyak job banyak jer orang yang tak ada kerja but I tak tahu lah maybe I'm looking at the wrong places mungkin my agents are not really good
no ya that's why like most of them macam I wanna leave singapore I don't want to stay at singapore or something but to live at singapore you need job honey
a'ah like dia cepat-cepat sangat dia progress
ah I'm grateful that we jadi ita tak ke belakang tau jadi kita tak ada slow
future kids you know future grandchildren you know dia orang akan dapat macam a lot of privileges lah and then same time makan maju lagi cepat dari kita lagi
pintar pintar eh wow bahasa melayu pintar is pintar is pandai lah ya I don't know tiba-tiba
ya lah nak pakai lah ni pandai okay pandai tapi
ya but I'm seriously like grateful lah sebab singapore macam very multiracial multiracial and then macam we don't we don't really have like racial discrimination amongst the
for me singapore job is ah ya ya a bit difficult for me to get singapore job sebab kena banyak mandarin mandarin kena banyak berbual mandarin then macam
hello mas apa khabar
it's okay macam melayu cakap kalau jodoh tak ke mana mm so what are your plans for this weekend

biasa lah singaporean bila yang dia orang tak complain
mm understand ya I think uh COVID nineteen ni menjejas banyak singaporean
then ya lah kita tak boleh keluar rumah tak boleh keluar negeri susah ah nak pergi holiday pun tak boleh kesian tapi itu lah
it's like they say prevention is better than cure ya so pasal I think malaysia pun sekarang masih ada banyak case ah so it's still unstable lah
I think uh ya ya I saw that I think my friend a colleague of mine also ada bilang juga
ah no lah I think it's just protection the mask think surgical mask pun can do its job lah
ya lah sekarang pun yang baru-baru case dekat tampines mall tu wah
because I was there then I think a few days I think one day later think they announced that there's a case of COVID nineteen at tampines mall terperanjat seh
uh so far tak ada pula case yang lain-lain
I mean yang in the community lah
ah because you will never know seh who yang ada penyakit ni then kita pun senang jangkit especially dengan macam
warga emas dengan kita punya parents nak kena jaga-jaga
ya I think baru semalam news uh that people are queuing over at mana eh
in place ah tapi kan from the look of the photos tak ada jer think these people sometimes are just trying I don't know
ya lah that's where the christmas light up is lagi so this year has been a challenging year lah ah
ada bagus juga lah that you
tak ni lah but ya I think it affects everyone like even most singaporeans who used to frequent to ke malaysia ke I think it's affecting business everywhere uh kedai-kedai tutup ada orang kena buang kerja kesian kan
I think mm mana-mana affected
mm ya lah but I think the singapore government is like allowing people to come in for work for business ah cuma are required to have the mandatory swab test then uh like
tak payah lah so I I dengar daripada kawan-kawan yang kena swab test yang
uh kalau
kalau dibuat dengan betul tak lah rasa sakitnya kalau orang baru or trainee yang buat wah rasa lah pasal dia orang cucuk dalam sekali
ya I think I even my friend yang
ya actually quite kesian ah in this situation macam banyak orang ada family but
kena berhenti kerja business tutup
twenty twenty has been uh ya lah like I said a challenge lah untuk kita semua mudah-mudahan dipermudahkan lah
measure steps ah I think which is quite good lah for all lah even though maybe some of us feel that we are restricted tak boleh keluar ke apa but still it's for our own good lah
oh I do actually err I think he pre-ordered the mask even before COVID ya I think I think he's the type like ah so he and his wife dah beli
ya but I don't know how berapa bagus yang reusable punya mask
tak lah because uh
bulan december err think my mother's birthday is coming so maybe nak ajak makan lah but
wah only can keluar um five lima orang sahaja
think kalau the atmosphere is different lah when you dining outside err dengan makan kat rumah kan
take care of ourselves lah think the celebration is is actually pasal kita nak kena
mm mana kita berhenti tadi
um ah awak
seorang baker awak suka masak apa
untuk family
pandai juga awak baking eh abeh kalau masak masak apa
oh untuk lah eh suami awak family awak makan yang sedap-sedap pasal sekarang kat luar pun banyak kedai makan yang tutup pasal COVID ni
mm mungkin pasal orang dah stock up ke uh iya lah singaporean kan macam saya cakap kiasu dia orang suka benar simpan
oh beli barang banyak-banyak rakan kerja saya pun ada nasi uh three or four packets for a family of
ya lah kesian yang orang-orang yang ya lah tak ada pendapatan mm tapi saya rasa ada juga restriction on every household that can buy certain like rice like maybe two packets of rice per household
mm ya lah saya pun kesian juga orang yang tak ada rumah tak ada tempat tinggal mana agaknya dulu kalau masjid buka boleh juga orang tidur dekat masjid sekarang saya rasa lagi susah lah mana dia orang pergi
mm betul tu uh there's a lot of platform yang go digital so I think uh everyone every household actually needs like a smartphone like a laptop ah these are now necessities
ya I think uh a lot of companies are like working from home and stay at home when they can lah so it's best they do so lah during this period but then your brother is from the airline industry airline industry I think is badly affected seh ya I think my friends either yang kena retrenched at an early age eh
ya kesian kan
I think dia tak akan take the swabber paying job lah pasal I think he has more kids at home kesian takut he'll be affected lah even though he'll be uh think
he has his reasons lah for not doing that kind even though it's uh gaji tinggi but still dia tak kalau boleh tak mahu dedahkan uh
ya where should we go to makan what is your favourite food
yes the curry is uh sedap
ah ada yang baik tu boleh juga pakai app sekarang kan semua
wah see sekarang semua dah high tech
order makan pun boleh
ya at this point memang ah it's not
not right to be walking on their own tapi ia untuk kebaikan dia orang pasal kalau dia orang dah terexpose dengan COVID ni I think it will take masa yang panjang untuk dia orang to recover to get well ah kesian I'm looking at my mother who's asthmatic kan macam I try not to let her out of the house as much but sometimes you know they want to go out have fresh air ya kesian kan
mm betul tu abeh lagi cause my parents are staying on their own kesian kan we don't get to meet them as much abeh ada some old folks tak tahu pakai smartphone so lagi tak jumpa anak-anak cucu-cucu so kesian dia orang so masa-masa gini lah kita patut berwaspada even though it's sad but we have to follow lah
ya lah yang generasi yang
lama mereka tak terexpose dengan internet macam kita sekarang so with this technology I think dia orang will
ah ambil masa untuk
so kesian so
macam makin kurang and there's less interaction human interaction
ya lah tapi segolongan mungkin tak ramai orang tua yang mahu belajar pasal pada mereka mereka dah lanjut usia and dah tak banyak masa lagi dalam dunia cuma kita doakan yang terbaik kita pun kalau boleh
mm actually in the market now there's quite a number of phones lah yang mereka boleh gunakan cuma iya lah nak kena ajar mereka tu mungkin mengambil masa lah
that's why it's uh important lah to untuk mereka um update dengan keep with the trend apa yang berlaku bukan jadi trendy lah cuma keep up with the times
mungkin juga lah tapi sekarang mungkin dalam masa yang terdekat akan masuk ketiga so mudah-mudahan kita semua dapat
um balik semula kehidupan yang normal
some dan hari raya
mm uh macam
kirakan contact is now minimal lah mm
sedih lah tapi macam mana
mungkin kelonggaran ini akan dinaikkan lah setiap fasa mungkin melebih lebih orang boleh keluar boleh jumpa boleh bergaul tapi ambil masa ya
iya lah pasal singaporean usually kalau holiday akan go overseas uh mm holiday uh tapi sekarang tengah
tak boleh kemana-mana cuma di singapore
oh bagus tu idea staycation
boleh juga awak dan family destress
mm okay lah ya lah macam saya cakap ini adalah
the new normal yang kita akan lalui tak tahu berapa lama lagi
harap bersabar sahaja lah kita doa-doa yang terbaik semoga keadaan akan bertambah baik untuk kita semua
oh itu safe distance ambassador
ah dia orang akan memerhatikan
okay lah ada yang volunteer ada yang dibayar gaji ni part of the
government agency yang united mm
mm tu lah saya pun perasan juga
tak lah mungkin mereka
berjalan-jalan untuk mencari orang yang melanggari peraturan lah tapi saya tak rasa dia orang boleh mengangkap dia orang boleh menasihat
uh dengar kata dan tak lawan peraturan-peraturan mm
oh tu mungkin dia orang volunteer daripada lain lain agency mungkin yang tak ada uniform tu mungkin
dalam bekerja lah untuk united
mm agaknya pakcik tu
uh tu dia orang tu dah nak hantar boleh lah
time semua orang tak ada kerja lain
ya so he was on my list like eh local uh local account lah like eh this one look like singapore like that ya so then I went to see then actually the at first the dia punya videos was all quite macam angsty ah like
oh you see this vulgar tat tut tat semua basically like macam all the people like being annoying lah time dia tengah nak deliver
and then it was very weird because I also saw one video of dia pergi tampines mall and he was like guys look it's all dead dead and I was and pasal tu time kan so we cannot go out kan and I was like oh my god I've never seen tampines mall look like that
ya serious macam like like some horror story is here
ya then only okay I'm not sure if it's recent but like I only recently noticed that he started doing live kind of just scrolling one day like malam-malam buta like nine plus I was like eh this guy doing live live what sia
because at that point in time I just thought macam he records and then edits and then posts right so I was thinking he left and then my my impression of live is like you sit in front of the camera and talk right so then I was just like oh wow wow he cause it
yes abang grabfood
and I think the funniest part was that um based on his cause his accent is quite vague and like you know he's the kind yang like cause of like his friends dulu kat secondary school semua kan and primary school so he like knows how like malay slang also he's like apa ni bro
he actually he has the beng vibes but the most kekek thing is like the way he talks is very macam narrator that's what people described it as you got the narrator voice very mesmerizing
kelakar lah like
ya it's quite bahan actually
exactly so I think actually by right dia punya target audience is
all following you it's so scary you know oh my god like there was this kid dia macam
I was like I say asal this budak like freaking thirsty you know
macam dia kata come live with me apa apa apa then aku was like
eww then aku press dia punya profile then I was like oh my god this is like some eleven year old girl dancing I'll just like get off tiktok
ya oh it was so scary so and then um so he me to say thanks for sending like coins and likes and stuff then the way he talk kan is macam corporate gila
tu lah pasal dekat dia tanya um in which area do you reside I was like reside eh
first off aku dah block dia I was like saying uh don't worry I'm not under age I'm like I'm twenty four and he was like okay that's great
ya because uh and then semalam pun like there was this girl that was like remember me I'm the sixteen year old girl then I'm just like ah eh awkward
technically ah I mean it makes sense because it's like their generation yang pakai kan but it's still very disturbing lah but I'm just glad that he doesn't like ya he like tak layan and then he doesn't assume anything oh ya then he was like how do I address you ah aku was like how do I address you macam then
the next for me macam the automatic response is miss farizan takkan lah kan apa seh macam merepek sia
zan ah actually aku was like alamak aku terlupa nak tukar my um name pasal it's still zan A yang ikut my um and aku was like
alamak too late to change to air lah takpe takpe lah zan lah zan jadi lah
yes oh my gosh he was like I'm very tired right now but if I'm not wrong you asked me to call you zan right and I was just like yes senpai noticed me ah terima kasih terima kasih
a'ah I was like opocot aku jadi marauder I there's actually like no real function to it ah cuma macam bragging rights jer
a'ah so I macam ah my dreams
ya I was I was like planning kalau macam ini hari kan kalau aku jumpa dia I will be like grab ge</mandarin
probably dia macam siapa then aku was like confirm tu kena instant block
oh ni dia eh yikes
tampines that's why so dekat
ya actually dekat and I kind of roughly know macam tempat dia lepak
no lah not his but his route yes because like like kat kat tak banyak tempat yang that you can
like order food from it's always like those fast food places it's always the macs yang dekat the interchange always
every night there will be at least one from there burger king dekat the
so I don't know like actually his account macam supposed to be like educational ke apa at an entertainment but it's so true I think like now I can identify like know the back models and shit in case like aku yikes
ya and then there's the mat minah tiktok
is that is that the meaning of pull like can I pull you I don't know because I keep seeing it on my feed then aku macam what's this eh like
I macam pull apa eh macam pull follow ke apa ke macam but it's like those thirst trap punya videos
ah a'ah kan I tak faham
okay but macam maksud dia tu apa
I I was just thinking of the mat minah call
just macam
macam how did you discover that app do you remember
ya ya because macam at the start that was what it looked like kan it was macam in between musically and vine
macam there's the reputation kan
technically those people must be underage juga
no it doesn't come too often I think that one is just macam by proximity like you know the few local
you're talking about macam algorithm dia
that's the thing which I'm god I'm very surprised because like once I post terus like it's very fast but then it like just dies off I macam okay all right
like then the subsequent macam views and stuff will be like people who are what searching for it
ya ya so this one macam the benda-benda bodoh I don't tag it I just macam
ya so that's the thing right I was like wow I didn't know that tiktok ada live firstly so then like his live was the first one that I watched
ya so it's um it's really interesting it's like you know how um live eh no not live eh live and live ada like the likes kan but it's just macam free kan you press
jadi boleh spam ke apa entah so apa ni like tiktok ada like some kind of coins system okay like for few coins you can sell like emojis
I don't think it's that much lah because like I said macam dia punya follower base is more like budak-budak kecil so macam he will he will say say like oh thanks for the like double like I send the rainbow puke
he was like oh thanks for the rainbow puke and I pun macam he's like rainbow puke is not is not cheap I mean it's not even one cup of bubble tea sweet talk sekarang pun like dah lagi mahal bro
so like everyone is always saying stuff like oh come to my area come to my area he was like you send me a carousel lah kan and aku was like what is this thing he's talking about
you see that's why you should donate to me dia cakap kelakar gila dia macam his humour ya
and then like I think I finished my virtual punya class and macam they just started opening that time face to babad like
like middle of last year or something so I always like holy shit like how I know I I I uh I recognize the dance moves kan then I was like hey insyirah like is this afrobeat standard like ya macam how you know and all that then aku aku was telling her lah that I listen to the songs and all this
then she was saying oh it's that this studio da da da da so uh it took me like damn long like aku just took the information and just like buat bodoh ah until happened
and then phase two then aku was like okay if I were to do a dance class that is not a lindy I'm gonna do this
a super fast one and aku was like aku nak mati eh
after a long break it's just like rombak rombak and I was like ha
like and then like each five ada like segment ah then you cannot mix
then that one uh because you maintain two meters tak payah pakai mask
ya my lindy punya yang solo pun begitu uh our capacity is about twelve
so sama lah two meters and all that tak payah pakai mask tapi tu recently um because of uh partner work and then like we are constantly sanitizing then tu kena pakai mask ah pasal like contact
but itu pun they try to minimize like they try to do more solo dance sikit jer partner ada ya
dah lama I tak joget penat gila sia I was like ugh
stamina dah turun muscle semua dah macam dah layu
that's the one yang I I started with ya so a lot of my songs are yemi alade songs ya
it's like wah I love him macam the dia punya beat dia punya percussion dia is like is like
it's not as tacky as like macam ada like dia punya ah rentak ah dia like kebak kebak means like cool
and macam I feel like dia orang punya bahasa is actually quite nice also
ya then recently like um the class introduced me to all new like new songs lah as in new and macam different artists ah artists that I don't listen to it's usually like this guy artist
I don't know if it's cause like he only listens to guy artists ke apa besides beyonce
ya oh my gosh okay so that's the other thing like I feel so macam at home like finally an instructor who's not doing zumba
like that's the only thing kita boleh buat like hello excuse me hello police
ya so and macam the group feels very nice and chill and he's the kind yang like having fun is more important
macam you you just try and do like it's okay if you don't catch it exactly but macam he wants you to like feel the music and like enjoy
ya but he very cool lah macam even the not the okay sorry he's the receptionist but he's the studio owner he's also malay
no no no actually K K jap there's two people the receptionist is called ash so he's she's owner and then zul is one of the teachers
then hakim also teaches like um dance fall but I don't like dance fall dance fall macam a bit macam sexy ah I macam oof
ya then okay it's quite kekek like last two days kan I went for the same studio I tried uh homerun choreo
that one like aku nak mati sia
the person kan like mellow she's a good dancer but dia punya ajar dia macam like from the get go is like super detailed
macam my brain cannot
macam badan angle tangan angle
ah kepala angle I macam ugh
ya so I said I don't like I don't get the I don't get the flow for K pop I macam
yes and loncat-loncat
then macam I felt so demoralized ah like it's so susah and like
so for me the thing is that like kalau stuff that is not a lindy end I don't want to use my brain so I have to use my brain after and then I get very fed up
I think cause I'm not like a fan kan I just do it cause macam it looked interesting
and then the ones next to her friends semua they were like eh today I become chicken ah I was like that's not wrong macam a lot of them their position I'm just like kenapa ayam kenapa ayam
ya macam cool but okay like if that's what you vibe with
sorry ah pekak
mmhmm apa-apa pun pekak
eh lupa ah K jap
no lah okay so ceritanya is apa tau this phone the near RAM only three gig
dia punya internal kalau bukan sixteen thirty two eh
and then eh I try to log in from outram sampai past series belum log in you
disconnect lag crash semua the whole cycle
whoa macam no ya so then I could I could I really cannot you like besides gaming macam
apa eh like it's just super laggy ah macam everything keep crashing and I was getting very frustrated
and macam segala benda pun tak boleh buat pasal err internal memory dia dah habis kan
so like literally I was running on entah something macam hundred of free space ke apa entah
exactly so that's why macam dia punya performance pun dah macam tahi ah
huh but anyway dah dua dah dua tahun ah
so I'm not sure what I should be using this for I I might use it for macam work taruh like um prepaid ke apa kat dalam tu
because actually phone ni tak rosak ya it's just and after I bought it over I I can uninstall all the things I'm not using ya so
mm it's okay then now I found a new use for it lah because I was thinking eh macam mana kalau I want to game but I also want to watch his live
I akan dengar I just dengar suara dia jer
ya dah suara dia sedap
suara dia macam macam dia punya voice quality is very good
like macam okay K K uh I once irritated my friend then by sending him like a maplestory M punya guide
macam kau dengar aku macam nak sepak ah hmm
but this guy ah macam kau just dengar just like ya macam cool like night setting you know
ya but ini hari I think ini hari dia main muzik so
sekarang you you'll hear him like sing and stuff
macam daripada mana eh tiba-tiba kan
but like why dia need to pakai okay sorry no no no apa dia punya power actually
dia macam apa gravity ke
I was like huh macam-macamnya power dia
kalau kau kalau kau watch three a day
kalau twenty three sikit jer
eh kalau you tengok six a day tau six a day by right empat hari dah habis twenty four
kau rewatch eh
rasa macam escapism which I'm like oh macam I don't like to be too close to reality
it was the most merepek ah okay okay no that's not okay I take that back after seeing things that bandai has released recently that's not the most merepek
but it's the most macam fantasy lah like super idealistic you know macam the guy must must always get the girl and then ada rival ada love triangle
that's rude ya macam
habis orang mati one episode the next episode everybody's over it like bitch
ya macam oh and then um they are like super gifted and talented pilots like out of nowhere macam
because at that time kan that uh macam the way you pilot is still macam pakai macam like you driving gitu ah you akan pakai um got the apa macam clutch semua and all that pedals and stuff
it's not like so I thought that was quite smart macam the later on the animes kan they they used macam uh like it it goes into your brain
and stuff so much lah you can you can see like it's instinctual you know you don't need to control it uh I was gonna say extra silly physically like it just reads your nerves ke apa entah like okay sure like that's fine
like macam if you're naturally or maybe you fight a lot like in person so maybe that translates when you fight for granted like okay fine that's kind of understandable
but like macam gitu lah they are kids man like there's no way that you can just be gifted like oh macam drop drop from the sky gitu like merepek
ya because it's mm it's a bit dia punya plot
there's then gundam got a few timelines so there's one timeline that he's like like the gundam sampai like
and then they continue macam star wars gitu ah so it's like wah the timelines is like freaking messed up
ya but that one was okay but it was macam eh a bit too that one a bit too fantasy ah
ya betul
ya it's always senang kalau nak cakap
because you're not in that situation apa
ya I see that a lot on twitter also macam they will like err retweet those those um am I am I am I an asshole punya post
and then dia orang just like throw the whole man away lah apa you know macam like ya like macam
I guess you can write that way but macam think about how that person is like going through right
ya macam kau they only they only have one season so it's like twelve or something aku rasa
then macam huh okay itu jer like ya that's what I was thinking oh actually kalau I wanted to catch up session quite easy
and like the singapore people don't even the singapore punya what or something they don't even bother to like remove it like
ya but that's the thing lah macam
but macam it's very like we we call it like what anime typical lah canon typical violence
so macam entah leh
but our censorship selalu macam tu
kau rembat jer
kekek jer sia
ya like ho kita cool
kan kita dah besar
but usually they will put actually okay no actually that one was for like and stuff right they will put like macam sixteen then I said they will put the the like triggers kat bawah macam
it sound so weird but macam
like in the science textbook they always show you macam
alah benda tu macam benda biasa jer bagi dia
you know it brings me back to that convo that we had about macam like
and is it okay but I think it's really like macam commendable lah that you are like now taking on the responsibility even though it's like shit but macam
wait kejap dia interested ke dia macam intrigued
it's just like macam thinking about it
it's so weird that when we say younger is now like sixteen seventeen but time tu kita rasa kita macam dah besar
masa tu like my god is sixteen
so it's like so meluat
when I jumpa that my malaysian friend I was like duh
as in I didn't say it macam explicitly but I was like dia baru keluar dari sandiwara ke apa
macam the perangai and cara dia cakap and cara dia like um carry himself is so reminiscent of that I just I was just nice I was like you sound like um I was just trying to be nice
give the full burn satu
mm a'ah yang mana
oh pasal apa eh
oh wow mesti of course and his father is like
oh wow mesti of course
totally wrong ke it's okay it's okay
kat masjid dia orang ah
dia orang ada Q&A session ke apa
wow habis no one was able macam curious cat version
macam he's trying lah
did they show the questions yang she wrote
it's not like macam lame questions kan like those questioning the fundamentals eh
ya lah pasal hari-hari orang just setakat tanya um
ah is smoking haram
macam dah stop it sia like
okay for her everywhere and jalan
okay so orang ni tanya soalan and then they
so dia dia received the question so ustaz tu received the question lepas tu dia dia just simpan dia tak address on the spot
it's true lah I guess it's macam it's getting better these days like definitely but macam
ya ya like kat rumah ya
sekejap eh dia actress dia pakai tudung
macam macam like if it does not add to the plot right kenapa nak bagi sangat orang tu
so kacau macam kau nak tidur lepas tu dengan pin pin dia semua
oh macam uh yang instant ah
I see like unless dia orang nak cakap orang-orang malaysia semua like sleep with tudung like that lah
step like I was going to say step alim but is that rude
bodoh kan
orh macam
macam tak ada ke tak ada ke model lain eh kata shampoo eh
atau macam at least just maybe like say macam the fragrance is nice or something and then like
what mask itu kerja ah
then bila kau nak buat kau nya business sia
then bila kau nak buat you buy the materials and then you never cut
a little similar tak apa lah asalkan it's
okay kita pakai dia orang punya prompt

exercise chey step badan badan step abang body ah step ah it's don't know like really exercise ah bo pian leh like
I tell you stay at home you confirm fall sick one ah rabak gila sia
every night I think we we we did like macam apa
covered thirty days thirty days sial wah gila babi sia thirty days
gila thirty days
so you see them from a virtual screen macam everyone dalam kotak-kotak sendiri so pelik ah but
ya ya pity them ah that one rabak ah or people who are you know alone lonely ah nobody to talk to ah wah
stop lah not say stop lah like there's still a lot of restriction ah I know there's a at least we still can now can at least go out meet people or you just be out alone you know just lepak lepak or what but of course keep a safe distance lah
ah then at least people you know it's good to be outside ah like you stuck at home wah mati sia mati mati mati confirm mati one but but but good lah we can go out
ya I heard ah rabak eh rabak sia like that one hour or maybe they have a few few hours only to go out then very strict wah rabak rabak but rabak one is in india ah wah the police rembat sia the police wah that one that one really rabak ah the police rembat the people who go out but then you know it's not supposed to be that way lah but then what to do they have to be very strict right but hopefully it's not going on now lah
entah semua busy semua macam
busy ah biasa lah family people
wan G also work busy he also dia baru cakap sikit hari rabak sia kerja macam recently start rabak ah after public holiday macam err apa kerja daripada pagi dia start pukul sepuluh habis pukul satu pagi that kind
ah kat rumah orh
work from home orh ah rabak gila like rabak gila
but tak tahu ah but dia dapat keluar weekends ah but I think weekends also he go out also spend time with wife orh like what else he can do right
tak tak isyad pun ada cakap juga the part wan G wan G turun sekejap ah but entah I think they got family event ah ke apa entah tak tahu ah but tak kesah ah at least they go out ah
lama gila dok
aku rasa the last kita jam before circuit breaker atau
kita tak jam terus lepas balik yang vietnam punya show lama lama gila lama gila babi
like semua semua put on hold lah okay lah but at least other bands macam ada jam ah like space ya quite active lah like no cause we also we we also
like take some time off just to do the mixing lah but I think cause that time we prioritise on that first lah cause dah lama gila seh like hold back kita punya recording
entah tengok ah tapi dah habis ah dah habis mix dah habis finally habis ah like dah swee ah tinggal hantar mastering then lepas tu
tak tahu we still finding for for people lor um
tak ah err overseas ah
tak tahu dorang boleh dapat sound dia ke tak
kalau haji hussin boleh
err oh tu dia punya mixing mastering suite eh
tak nanti nanti aku berbual dengan dorang ah try to talk to them we also finding ah we will be sitting down
I don't know ah that's the plan ah I follow only cause I think the the whole idea of song by song is like at least you know scared like kita release macam all one shot kan nanti macam people get bored easily ah like ah so kita punya style gitu ah I mean is four songs only apa it's not it's not like a whole album lah if whole album then
what what's the whole concept ah you know what I mean the whole concept of the is macam is all err is is interconnected ah is like err is like err macam a story ah from song number one to song number four
ah yes concept album so semua macam interconnected ah there's a story to it ah
so kita plan macam release song by song right then every song ada different artwork
budget ah see what kind of concept lah then also must pay for mastering err then we use up some money also for for our recording and all so but then we'll see ah we'll see how it goes ah pelan-pelan ah pelan-pelan kayuh ah
tapi dia still macam part of it pe part of us dia tak keluar like know tak keluar in a bad terms dia keluar in a good term
and then you know he he was also part of the whole recording journey in the beginning pe ya so then tak kesah ah then we will we'll see how ah kita nanti duduk berbual we discuss with everyone see if they okay with it
entah tengah rabak juga ah
pasal dia was working dekat mana eh
dia was working dekat
then lepas tu err circuit breaker dia kena laid off just like that
baru masuk orh baru masuk like I think one month plus two months ah
then kena laid off so dia struggle ah but I think he's doing graphic design and also food delivery ah but okay eh the food delivery actually actually cannot help cannot help ah
so not bad ah I mean simple don't want to make it over very overly mix if not like rabak sia like like overly produced
duh rabak rabak rabak rabak rabak that one rabak but okay lah we see lah
tu lah
tapi aku rasa kalau touring kan confirm tak so soon punya confirm lama lagi seh
aku tahu aku tahu aku tahu pasal siti nak kahwin
tu ah abeh macam mana kacau mesti kacau punya abeh macam mana orang nak kahwin
tapi kau dah set seh
aku rasa dia masih cakap the the only girl in the family
tapi depends ah individual pe tapi tak tahu ah tak tahu tak tahu apa pasal lah eh but maybe sekarang memang period dia nak tak tahu aku tak tahu maybe dorang buat grand ke tapi
ya but entah lah eh
I think he doesn't show ah he doesn't show that he needs to struggle lah but but before that dia he was okay what when he he haven't got he was going to get married I I
oh ya lah beli rumah cause rumah expensive but then got pe
ya aku tak tahu tapi
but then again both kerja full-time pe full-time should be able to sustain apa macam kalau you say you like freelancer okay ah of course ah that one jialat but but full-time confirm every month you will get
tapi pun depends ah if how big of a house you want to buy ah I mean if you technically if you one time you want to buy one big house of course it's quite expensive lah but if you start small anyway houses you can sell what you know some people will start small buy three room first ah
if not ah if us ah walao confirm confirm huru-hara one macam apa ni apa ni apa ni apa ni apa ni apa ni
nanti aku depressed dengan duit orang dengan aku sendiri stress seh eh macam mana ni
tapi tu rabak juga sia kalau dia cabut
tapi estee power ah estee pandai manage ah
but entah lah
tapi okay lah band band aku missy shoot pun
missy shoot pun nak record lah so tapi kita take it easy pasal sekarang I mean hakim is busy with work rabak gila aku macam dah beberapa minggu sia tak jumpa dia ajak lepak tak jumpa ajak lepak tak jumpa
dia jam dekat sini tapi dia actually tak reply message
bila dorang book
dia tengah busy
dia so dorang tak ada dia dorang message dia tengah busy dia tak dia tak dia tak dia tak reply pasal tengah busy kan so dia belum cakap dia okay ke tak then suddenly they book
they book already ah dorang dah book huh serious ah dorang dah book semalam aku tak reply sia
then dia turun ah tu pasal aku rasa dia lambat cause dia kena settle family benda punya pe I mean he work also busy already then he needs to spend time with family so bo pian ah
ya tapi okay lah but missy shoot pasal kita selalu jam also on weekdays jadi dia pun tengah busy tapi kita tengok lah but definitely the plan is to record at least by
hujung tahun ni ah
tak tahu ah
I think sial is very influential macam banyak influence err orang-orang probably also cause of
dia female fronted
abeh and then nyanyi malay lagu melayu
then very very strong musical apa
bagus juga rare juga nampak band macam gitu like playing macam
betul aku realise that juga
I mean aku ikut korang yang time europe tour aku realise actually aku get to see many things
but then again I think the twenty four hours pun macam can feel the vibe lah pasal you are still macam dekat another country orh then you see like even though macam say for example eh for example kau main germany ah but different parts of germany have different style like that culture is like super different ah
so at least you get to see that culture know macam berlin really very
power and hipster hipster-ish very ni and then you go to another part of germany is like very more rundown ghetto sucky very kampung like in kampung ah but then
macam save cost ah kau tak payah spend duit on macam err apa lodging dorang will kasi kau crash tempat dorang I mean that's the give and take ah you know
I mean I think dia maybe that his style ah if he don't like that culture or not say culture ah he don't like the vibe of the place I think he don't want to go lah
ah same same as long as I get out of here like singapore for at least that whole stretch two weeks ah two weeks pun dah cukup
cause kalau tak rabak sia kau
cause aku realise siti is is quite an adventurous person looking at her travel photos like when she posts on her social apa instagram
she can travel alone dia boleh travel alone pergi macam
ah tu pasal ah
gila cause aku realise cause bila that time kita dekat london tu then dia willing to go jalan-jalan sorang dia pandai explore seh like like she knows her way ah like to to just explore ah dia tak takut she got she's fearless ah but I think
that something yang holding her back ah
ya but tak tahu ah
aku pun nak tour lah dengan macam urgent matter I mean missy shoot lain sikit lah pasal kalau nak tour
probably lagi susah lah pasal lal pun macam iman's league right and then it's very
it'll be hard lah I mean cause missy shoot broke up for quite a while then I think the focus for him was iman's league ah then he came back so but I think he he still very on lah he wrote songs for missy shoot like even like you know when he do chords then he will ask eh does this ni kena tak
then macam tak ah ni tak kena ah ni very very iman's league ah okay tak apa then dia akan tukar to change to kita punya vibe
selalunya is dol or most of the time is dol lah
he he he did give some ideas err when we take in some ideas some ideas macam tak kena lah pasal it's not our vibes but he tries to control not to go into macam very rubik's vibes
you know ah dia macam
err but he will try to control he he don't want to macam dia tak nak tukar the sounds
ah bad religion I mean influence ah cause we influence with bad religion abeh macam influence with rise against dol punya influence is heavily rise against
heavy lal is very melodic guy lal suka melody so he
japanese punk like cause he grow up with macam he grow up with a lot of ska music and then japanese ska japanese punk rock he he he dia banyak macam on that vibe but aku is more very bad religion penny wise ah
ah propagandhi err that fast and know a lot of yes so that that vibe so at least it's but bagusnya everything is jumble up you see so semua dah jumble up semua dah macam
biasa ah
but entah eh
dia macam very err straight kan
tapi dorang tak tahu ah zul dah tak cakap dengan ni ah dengan bob ah eh practise ah single pedal aku feel playing single pedal
yang buat dia very unique ah dia macam unique gila ah but then ah to each its own ah style ah ya but see ah see ah I don't know ah we still got a
betul dorang dah boring ah
bad religion still stick to that sound but then ada modern element I feel ah that's how I feel
he got a vibe ah a different vibe I still like bad religion ah cause dorang
cause they very abang abang
I don't know ah he some pop punkers like feeling feeling tapi macam
entah very kental ah I cannot this pop punk pop punk thing ah
tapi tengah set ah
then will send us then cakap okay err ni ni ni nak kena tukar sikit ni kena adjust sikit
err then he will adjust okay okay let's meet then bila time jumpa baru like minor tweaking and tweak as much as possible
then dah lah see how pasal kita record with no clicks then very simple err
miking macam drums only four mikes err so that's why some sound macam really tak boleh dapat and stuff lah but we this is like a trial ah for me lah it's a trial ah but then nanti tengok ah like in future future recording kita do it like better ah
cause hakim macam dah offer eh next recording aku aku will make sure like all the all the miking will be better lah
ya lah that's why dia dia discovered tu pasal that time actually dia offered to macam eh macam kau nak rerecord balik kau punya drum but then
ah but then aku cakap eh tak ada click orh we don't play with click so it's gonna be susah sia like okay lah we try ah I did record like what um we tried half a song ah but it's difficult cause there's no click
tak feel ah like tak feel ah so then I think then I told him next time ah like the next time we we we try to record
cause he discover but good thing that but good ah he's very hardworking dia discover sounds so he he knows more stuff so next time round he can give more input lah but then again it's not a bad recording ah this time
correct but then have to be patient ah but then but then again for example this spacedays punya
spacedays punya vibe is because we we needed to
big one the big one tall one ah bass man fender bass man I think he bought for like what seven hundred plus then he he refurbish balik err for like four hundred plus so he actually spent like thousand plus on that cheap
dia rajin gila ah ya but good lah know he he he he invests on that lah he invests on that then to have like
then apa tu force vomit pun tengah record
ah then recently dia cakap last week eh last week dia cakap dia record dikir barat
don't know I think cause he knows some guys you know he he also got this ranggi ranggi guys ah ranggi is the motorcycle macam
ah so ranggi is actually macam um
ranggi is err some of them ada budak-budak dikir barat ah
so I think dorang
abeh hakim is a buat sounds pe
so dia macam pergi dekat dia lah but then banyak lah then it's like side bazaar bush man dia punya side project
adib I think adib playing bass err then got err um restam bushman main guitar then err rizal rizal dulu main sound of province rizal main sound of province dulu
rizal kecil
he covered ah session I think for sound province but he's a good drummer lah then dia main for this band aku tak tahu siapa lagi a few more guys ah like play for his band
so dorang macam rerecord balik ah ya
um but then financially maybe tak sangat lah
tu lah
tu pasal lah tak aku cakap dengan zad juga zad dia tahu macam dia tak ada benda abeh then tiba-tiba macam korang main semua cakap zad kau nak pakai pakai ah kau nak pakai pakai ah eh tak boleh ah kau mahal sangat macam tak kesah ah pakai jer it's a wear and tear thing
aku tahu dia mahal but then I'm giving you that that green light apa that green light to just go and use instead of
but okay ah understand sometimes people don't want to terhutang budi kau tahu
tak maybe maybe also from experience
like we don't know like maybe dulu dia pernah macam have this friend who like okay just use ah then after that after using already then like eh wah now I want to you never give me back macam you know
jialat ah jialat got friend ah but then tak tahu ah but I'm okay ah kalau zad nak pinjam
dah ah
tapi end of the day also all the stuff macam like it's a wear and tear punya benda pe so
tak boleh cakap kalau kau pakai tak pecah esok aku pakai pecah eh you also broken what it'll also break what like know like so it's okay lah I mean the thing is
ya that's why kesian sia I know he's been macam dia berbual dengan aku ah like cannot wait sia I cannot wait to play drums sia
ah I cannot wait to lepak I cannot wait to record you know I told him lah if you need to record a band say for example band want to record you just record then call some of us lah we can help you set up the mic setting ah
like I know he don't want to terhutang budi that's confirm and maybe his style is different dia takut macam dia
maybe he accidentally say for example we set the mic he scared he accidentally scold eh macam don't like that then he scared people like heart hurt what hurt the feeling hurt what so I don't think he's like that
but kita dah cakap ah I mean I already told him also eh kalau kau need to record you need help you just call us lah ah we will we will not ask for anything we will just help you ah cause you is is is you are the one doing the work
we here just to help lepak
sekarang mesti dia rabak gila seh dekat rumah tapi tengok ah
no but the thing is this type of thing right the walk right you cannot pikiran you know just go regret lepas tu ah regret after that ah but there's no regret ah I mean for me personally when I went err the walk was was rabak ah the starting was fun cause everything but
no but she also was struggling ah cause the last I think there was like four hundred metres we already saw the the entrance for coney island right that last four hundred metres suddenly like eh guys guys sekejap sekejap sekejap stop stop stop aku tak boleh aku tak boleh ah so we actually sat down and azil macam okay no problem no problem duduk
then it was like matahari dekat mata the sun was already like in the eyes ya
ya eight o'clock then kita macam eh kita rest like it was only like still it was also four hundred metres five hundred metres more can see already it's like the bridge was just in front of us then we took out our shoes then we lek sekejap lek sekejap
rabak ah for me ah personally but I told them sorry ah I say paiseh paiseh ah like we have to have a lot of stops
so you you still go but we take it slow never mind don't care about the time but as long as we reach there we settle ah ah so we did manage to finish ah so the moment we touch that thing right kita cakap kita sampai right
macam macam azil we made it ah we just high five sia
eh take photo take photo take photo lepas tu kita pergi tepi pengsan I lie down already sia I lie down already I don't care already take out shoes take out socks azil take out socks take out shoes aisyah also sit down then all termenung already like good twenty minutes
eh hafiz fetching ah jalan to the punggol settlement there is like another one click ah
one point five click ah betul
rabak ah
I I almost got into like hallucination already cause it's tiring already ah like oh dah penat ah dah penat ah dah penat ah mata dah rabak I cannot think properly then like want to smoke also malas you know like want to minum air just drink water ah drink water drink water drink water drink water
they even reach they want to eat also lazy you know so the moment we reach right actually hamimah zafran all they wake already they wanted to go makan
ya lah breakfast but cause aisyah ah hafiz fetching aisyah mah so they wanted to go makan then they ask you and nazril kau dengan nazril plan ah nak pergi makan mana then kita jumpa somewhere tu aku cakap eh tak boleh ah
kita nak balik tidur balik tidur ah nak balik tidur
so hafiz fetch us fetch actually wanted to fetch fetch aisyah then we wanted to grab home then hafiz cakap eh tak apa ah aku hantar korang ah
dia cakap semua orang dia dah rabak aku pergi cari toilet aku jalan balik dorang dah ketawa ketawa pasal aku dah slow gila then aku duduk aku duduk macam eh sia ah to go into the car also macam eh sia ah rabak sia ni
ah apa oh ya ya cause coastal
twenty one eh like like almost twenty clicks ah actually almost twenty clicks ya include east coast one way err hud told me is about twenty five clicks ye
tak but I think this time if we go right we we go that route but we
that sengkang we thought you is after that bridge thought the sengkang is already punggol sekali eh bukan it's another sengkang
but then the coney island right is if you go straight the park connector dia macam sampai dekat red bridge tau but this one is before red bridge kau dah belok kiri
so aku nak tanya dengan kau kalau kau ada tiga hajat so what are you going to wish for
you nak jadi billionaire lah okay
so can use your jet lah untuk pergi travel dengan family ni semua lah
duit belanja kau orang cari sendiri ah macam gitu ah
okay for myself lah eh apa yang I wish for is
if like kita nak pergi vacation ke apa ke vacation at least kita boleh
vacation macam near maybe malaysia ke apa ke kan ah boleh pakai kereta kan ah
then uh kalau macam tak pun kita buat plan macam pergi picnic ke apa
so whenever kita ada kita punya own car
ke kita nak beli grocery nak pergi shopping at least we got our own car
since we got a big family right ah okay lah kita ada car so
uh I want to have a baby lah at least kalau ada
stable punya ni
uh at least dah boleh ada anak
pasal ada anak banyak pakai duit nak beli pampers nak beli susu everything kan
ah so aku rasa
lebih baik uh
dah ada stable semua financial baru ada baby ah kalau tak stable nanti anak nak makan apa kan
takkan nak kebulur makan pasir eh ah jadi at least kalau kita dah ada duit ah at least we also
sebelum jadi richest pun kita nak kena pandai save duit
ah save duit you need to have plan about money ha
kalau kau dah plan ah semua jadi at least bila kau ada anak
nak hantar anak kau pergi sekolah sekarang sekolah bukan cheap eh
memang mahal lah mahal gila lah eh
lagi-lagi buku dia orang lagi baju sekolah apa semua ah abeh dia orang punya tambang pergi sekolah apa semua
abeh kau nak kena hantar apa semua unless kau nak belikan basikal ah untuk anak kau kan
basikal so suruh dia orang ajar dia orang macam mana nak kayuh basikal so at least they can
ah semua pasal duit okay lepas tu
lepas tu semua aku dah fikir fikir pasal ada anak semua aku dah fikir pasal future lah
ah then nombor tiga
aku fikir nak bawa family aku pergi holiday
mm pergi luar negeri lah pergi holiday ataupun aku pergi honeymoon sebab aku belum pergi honeymoon lagi kan
since daripada hari aku kahwin tu aku belum pergi honeymoon so that is why I'm thinking lah so at least
um dengan duit yang aku ada tu aku boleh bawa ah family aku pergi travel everything lah
tu yang aku fikir lah mm
so aku rasa yang paling penting sekali is
untuk ugh
rapatkan lagi silaturahim is dengan buat family gathering lah macam tu mm
oh that one I got heard from my mother-in-law yang pasal tu lah
my mother-in-law cakap lah yang dia dengar dekat warta berita kan since I kerja I pun tak ada time nak tengok warta berita kan
ah so bila my mother-in-law kasih tahu I macam
eh serious ah mak serious ah dapat
seratus dollar I thought is
seratus dollar in cash lah I was so happy ah sekali dia kata voucher
sekali you cakap dia orang pakai singpass lagi I cakap a'ah lah pakai singpass pula
ah that's why macam
boleh ke eh ah boleh ke tidak eh
apa yang kita tengok dekat warta berita dia orang kata tunggu lah dia orang announce kan
so kita tengok jer lah dia orang announce boleh pakai kat mana kat mana semua lah ah we just wait lah
so at least after dia orang dah announce kita boleh ni lah boleh discuss
maybe kita boleh buat vacation ke untuk kita punya ni lah
family buat family gathering like what I said lah
family gathering ke apa
kat singapore pun tak [pe] lah kan
since dia kata december baru dia keluarkan so about
then maybe from there we also can uh plan maybe buat january ke february ke
ah so kita boleh bring along our cousin
our cousin punya birthday kan uh january end of january
kita buat ah ni ah birthday party sekali ke apa ah
ah tengok lah kita nak book hotel ke kita nak book chalet ke apa ke
tak kisah lah resort ke whatsoever that we can book lah kan ah
tengok bajet yang kita ada ah with the bajet is it enough ah macam gitu lah kan
ah tengok lah depends
kita tengok lah kalau cukup then maybe kita boleh ni
ah dengan hundred dollar voucher tu maybe kita boleh
book hotel yang yang boleh buat vacation
um macam birthday party tu birthday event lah kita boleh buat event birthday party because
macam cousin kita kan uh birthday dia january then my husband punya is february kan
so uh why not kita buat end of uh january
dengan uh february pasal february first feb kan my husband punya birthday kan
ah so jadi kita dah buat ending january tu dengan first feb
at least dua hari satu ah satu malam
betul tak dua hari satu malam ah so kita boleh book so kita boleh celebrate both uh birthday
dia orang together kan ah so at least ah kita boleh ni ah bincang-bincang nanti plan dengan cousin kita macam mana
whether we want to book a resort ke
kita nak book chalet ke kita nak buat staycation ke ataupun kita nak sewa hotel ke
ataupun we also can plan want to picnic kat marina ke ah so at least
one day ke ataupun kita picnic jer kat situ sampai esok pagi so at least boleh
celebrate dua kat east coast ke west coast ke ah macam gitu lah kita celebrate ah
betul tak mm
overnight pun boleh picnic pun boleh lah kan lagipun kita semua
satu rumah what ah then yang lain dah kahwin yang yang kita nak ajak ni cousin dah kahwin ah so
it's okay since dia boleh bawa husband dia sekali ah
so maybe barang-barang yang kita beli kat daiso tu kita boleh buat sendiri lah tampal sendiri
tapi apa yang aku rasa lagi save is macam hari ni birthday our cousin kan then the next day birthday abang kan
my husband eh jadi you nak err buat macam mana jadi pukul dua belas
uh macam kita buat macam
uh eleven plus gitu nak dekat pukul dua belas so at least kita celebrate
satu kali jalan ah macam gitu kan so it's better right
so at least time kita celebrate okay uh kita dah
tiup tiup tiup oh okay okay lepas tu ah kira macam satu cake
ah then kita celebrate untuk hari ni dengan esok gitu
uh kita picnic kat west coast ke east coast ke
marina ke
err whatsoever lah payung besar sudah
actually right I got saw that time inside a website ah I not sure is it at west coast ke east coast
yang dia orang ada buka macam khemah besar tau
macam khemah kat dalam ada sofa ada macam I think it's sofa ya
dia orang buat uh ni
uh kira macam tempat murah-murah lah kat macam
yang kau boleh ni ah kira boleh chill chill dia orang cakap
sekali aku tengok eh
aku cakap eh not bad siak dalam ada ni eh
ah ni ah dia orang tengok ada table kecil aku tengok abeh lepas tu sofa
ah itu betul-betul khemah khemah macam khemah besar so if raining dia orang cakap kau tak payah risau
but uh morning I want to do some activity you know like rock climbing ke zipline ke if
abang to mm
but tak tahu lah eh tengok macam mana ah
nak buat apa seh
mm confirm like macam dah lah panas terik
ah lepas tu tengok-tengok binatang berpeluh-peluh lagi lepas tu ketiak semua nanti basah aduh
mak kan tengah sakit also right so
maybe dia orang akan bawa lah
takkan tak bawa kan gila tak bawa kan
dia orang pun kan tak boleh tak boleh hidup tanpa anak dia orang kan
confirm kalau shopping kita punya cousin
adik intan mesti memang suka suka gila shopping
especially kalau dia tengah ada duit dia memang suka shopping shopping tak habis-habis shopping baju baju baju
baju ah
so aku rasa
maybe lah kita just go with the yang pergi berkelah tu lah
lagipun kita dah lama seh tak pergi berkelah
a'ah seh picnic picnic picnic tak picnic picnic
but I think your abang
ah confirm dia cakap eh huh kenapa tak cakap siang-siang
ah akan save pe duit
then you can see pantai also ah
ya but I mean I don't really like the pantai but okay lah can
you feel like not bad right eh macam eh cantik pe view dia
eh why not I memang nak pergi
but I thought of going with your abang lah that time
kau tengok ah selalu jer kita busy busy busy macam
since dia kerja aku kerja
kan so tak ada time
then balik rumah pun buat kerja rumah
gedebak gedebuk semua ah so tak ada time lah
plan actually aku dengan abang kau macam macam tau plan
even aku
kita plan
nak buat rock climbing sama-sama ah
zipline ah ni semua
that's why I would like to ni lah cari
mana mana ah tempat yang ada kan activity macam gini
so at least kita boleh buat activity ni tak tahu kat mana yang ada activity ni
ah kallang memang ada
I got saw I got saw that time yang masih
aku pergi tengok wayang dengan kak faz kau kat kallang
after kak faz kau balik kerja tu
abeh aku cakap eh tak sangka seh rock climbing dekat dalam building ni then dia cakap
next time kalau bie nak join join ah dia cakap gitu so aku macam
oh serious ah aku pun macam
betul ke boleh join ni huh
dah macam tak ada confidence eh sekarang dah gemuk dulu badan macam mana kan ah
kalau dulu tak gemuk macam gini ah okay lah
aku pun tak tahu lah
hais makan makan makan malam aje makan lapar lapar lapar makan
so that when we lepak
kita boleh ni ah
makan makan makan ah sambil lepak tengok if I not wrong have
but if tak ada
kita still boleh lepak-lepak berbual-berbual sambil makan chips chips dia tak apa ah
kita beli chipsmore ke then kita beli chips ya lah chips biskut kan
ah yang cemil-cemilan ah
but serious ah kalau kita lepak macam gitu still nak buat pit ke
barbecue pit still nak buat barbecue pit
kita masak lah kan masak lepas tu bawa
since kita like what you say nak pergi petang kan ah okay lah
ah tempat sometimes especially weekend
so I think like kita nak kena book
uh ni cepat sikit
if not kita terlambat kita tak dapat lah tempat
maybe some of us ke siapa-siapa kita boleh pergi dulu so at least
tak kisah lah siapa sampai siang kan
kalau sampai siang at least kita ada tempat tau ada tempat
ah kita dah book untuk berapa orang
ah so at least dah ada orang tau
ah dekat tu tempat
jadi tak ada orang boleh ambil ah
ah then you say eh salah salah salah tempat ah macam gitu also cannot what
energetic ah gitu
ya drama melayu sangat aduh
and like what we say kan kita nak standby duit lebih sikit is because balik
kan kita nak grab kan jadi balik confirm penat pe kita dah ada activity kan lepas tu balik penat confirm nak grab kan
so that's why that's why I cakap yang ini I rasa lagi kita boleh save
kita dah kita bawa daripada rumah benda yang boleh pack
semua pack what I think is
better rather than kita bawa satu-satu gitu
then bawa banyak pinggan
it's better that kita bungkus bungkus satu-satu pack
so bila tu kita tinggal pass jer kat semua orang
so dalam everything kita boleh letak but like macam dia punya side
macam hotdog ke macam crabstick ke apa kan
ayam ke apa itu kita boleh letak dalam tupperware lah so
anybody can ni ah cuma mi mi ke nasi
ah tu kita boleh pack dekat bungkus so at least they can
tak lah sometimes people still need nasi what you never know you the kind yang nak nasi
ha you die die nak nasi ah betul tak
tak apa it's okay ya
mi untuk semua then letak nasi dekat dua bungkus sudah
nasi letak dua bungkus tu ah letak penuh-penuh
jadi kita tak payah ni ataupun letak satu tupperware
besar untuk nasi jer because the lauk-pauk is already we put different pe
I masak nasi goreng ah
macam esok kita nak pergi activity tu
ye kita beli everything
so kita potong semua
after kita potong semua simpan dalam ice box kita simpan dalam ice box the next day baru kita goreng and everything so bila kita nak pergi
so kita potong sayur sekali kita potong hotdog kita potong crabstick kita potong
ayam ke apa apa lah
yang kita nak kena potong kan apa yang
apa-apa lah fishball ke apa ah semua lah potong sekali
if rajin ah if rajin really rajin
kita boleh cucuk cucuk ah
cucuk hotdog fishball crabstick macam gitu sedap sikit
ha gitu
kita boleh minta tolong abang ke kak nani obvious ah dia tak akan tolong dia mesti kata nak tidur
oh but abang also nanti dia tired the next day abang kerja
but like what abang see if we really want to have some activity in the morning
ya that's why I cakap letak maybe mi ke
nasi kita letak dekat benda tu that's why I cakap terus nanti boleh buang tak payah ni
kita letak dekat tupperware jadi kalau kita letak dekat tupperware
tak payah ni so kita boleh buang
oh ya ya ya lepas tu kita cover pakai aluminium foil jer aluminium foil is it a'ah
tapi kita nak naik grab tu nak kena pegang juga lah
letak kat belakang ah semua
the whole kau punya ni
ah rides kau pegang jer barang-barang tu
confirm kalau semua goreng confirm kau akan rasa bosan kan
uh something like maybe lemak cili padi ke apa
letak so kita ada kuah dengan ni
tak payah eh
roti sandwich yes
apa yang kita perlu ada since ada event kan sandwich of course kena ada
so um that's why I cakap at least I nak letak satu dish
so bila ada satu dish tu
at least ada lah lauk macam
lauk kau cuma goreng-goreng jer kau akan rasa macam bosan sebab semua goreng
so at least kalau ada lauk sikit because
kau makan apa-apa pun kau mesti nak ada kuah kan
that's why I cakap
so at least I nak buat yang lemak cili padi ke apa ah something like that lah
ya like what I say maybe I nak buat yang tu
lemak cili padi ataupun I nak buat
uh sambal goreng satu sambal goreng satu lemak cili padi
sambal goreng is for mama because mama vegetarian
kita kena fikir nanti mama cakap eh sana ayam
eh sini ayam
ya we also need to remember eh kita kena beli uh vegetable ball
dengan apa tofu mushroom ah
some kind of this kind lah uh yang kita kena beli lah pasal kita bring along mama kan
confirm dia orang akan beli yang dekat belakang ah
dekat belakang rumah dekat pe
from there dia orang akan naik grab pe like what
uh abang seth cakap kan
macam abang kau ah dia pringles pringles tu tetap dia nak
you want to buy mi eh buy pula you want to masak mi hoon ke mi goreng
I think mi hoon goreng is better right because we got a lot right
so you want to cook nasi goreng is it
so you want me to cook the nasi goreng cina
I masak nasi goreng ikan bilis lah ada ikan bilis sedap sikit
ya lah ikan bilis itu lah that is what I mean
nasi goreng ikan bilis pakai ini pe is warna putih what
okay so you help me nanti potong-potong ayam
we potong
ya you potong ayam
so pasal I nak masak lauk pe
abang suruh potong hotdog ah nanti
dua packet cukup tak dua packet tak cukup empat packet
empat packet lah eh empat packet
but one thing I don't like is because I punya cut eh of hotdog eh is different
memang aku punya is like memang
slide slide uh ni apa
slice dia macam diagonal is it
aku tak nak lah macam
kalau yang ni kecil besar kecil besar because
aku punya orang is very particular about dia punya size kalau boleh aku nak buat tapi
sandwich lagi aku tak suka nanti senget macam bersepah
aku especially sandwich ni aku tak suka very particular lah
oh takpe
kita buat macam ni jer apa kata kita buat
so sebelah sapu tuna lah
lagi sebelah kita letak egg lah egg mayo lah
ah jadi bila tu kan dia jadi sedap tau ah I think this already good lah
so jadi dia orang tak ni
jadi dia orang kalau at least dia orang spread
ah tak ada lah ni sangat kan
tak lah pasal apa kalau sayur
ya because they don't really know macam mana nak letak ah
kau pun tahu pe aku kalau buat sandwich aku very particular aku nak make sure sandwich dia nampak cantik
so beli yang ada cili punya
you know itu baru sedap
so the crust apa awak nak buat ke
I think maybe kalau macam gini
since ada sandwich and ada ni then kita nak beli
fishball nak letak ke
since uh mama tak makan
so at least kita boleh buat cheese fries
if not nanti sampai sana semua dah taste not nice ya
kita nak beli mat yang dua dollar tu
tu lah aku pun fikir-fikir juga
because when we plan like what abang say when we plan every time
mesti tak jadi seh everything tak jadi tak jadi huh
I think why not we just buy a dress for kak nadiah
then for abang uh kita beli kasut jer
at least baju kan
she really need baju
since dia tak habis-habis cakap kakak tak ada baju kakak tak ada baju kakak tak ada baju kan ah
denim means kita lump sum pe sebab
kita sharing what duit share right so beli satu it's considered cheap what
kita beli kat uniqlo
but since kita nak pergi tu kita kena
bawa baju extra lah
so balik time baju colour ni eh
pergi baju colour ni ah betul tak
maybe first day navy blue ke because everybody can have blue colour since kak nadiah kau pun suka blue colour
aini kau suka blue colour
abang kau pun ada blue colour aku rasa ah so
kita boleh go with the blue colour lah navy blue then the second day
mm balik time maybe
oh dah macam time aku nikah green and blue
I got my jubah
pink also can I got no issue about pink colour I think abang also got no issue
but nanti dia kena pakai smart smart nanti dia cakap
apa ni nak pergi picnic kena pakai smart smart because the pink colour is dia punya smart casual
one ya kena gosok
but that one become smart casual ah ya abeh nanti macam tak gosok gitu eh
tak boleh lah
forbidden a'ah forbidden jadi obedient
kelakar seh
is it fun intern kat rumah
bukan ke a lot of distraction like that
ya so I work from home for macam
then I feel so like terkurung dalam bilik and the wifi is not strong
so that's why I rather work kat
only like macam about two weeks
ya only two weeks dua minggu
duduk kat rumah and you know what I don't even do in my room you know I do at the living room
that's why I tadi I ask you to take a picture of your your working setting
that is me in the office kalau kat rumah I will just like duduk depan depan then my laptop
oh make the home macam office like that ah
oh then what your wifi around your houses eh around your houses around the house macam good ah
ya lah then how you do your work seh macam gitu
like because your work from home pakai pakai pakai apa Microsoft or
ya the Google hangouts you they you never break out meh macam never lag or what
ya so now buat apa
oh you've been working part time kerja apa eh cause I saw on your Instagram you work night shift all
but you are still working what okay lah tu means you dah survive sikit
kerja apa why you never explain
oh pack apa
then you work alone or what not alone right ada orang lain juga kan
kerja kat mana kat warehouse eh
uh at ibu cik house lah the difference right
one week and then you cannot tahan
it's just too fast paced ah macam mm
ya one day berapa
if you are at the first first person ah then paling senang
quality check and need to buat cepat cepat then that's crazy ah
macam from
pack for eh no we start at about oh macam lapan setengah then lapan setengah all the way until pukul dua belas
uh scoop the kuah then after that you kiap the container then you
ah pack kat kitchen ah so ya the food is already ready and
sometimes you'll injure yourself because panas lah then when you kiap the container then you also will kiap your finger lah
bla bla lah then lepas balik
I mean the the packing place yang I kerja is um
express gila lah especially when you do quality check how to quality check cepat cepat seh
so that's how tired you are then now kerja apa seh kerja malam
like few months ago sekarang baru dia dapat
ya so kerja apa
then kenapa you leave
then besok buat apa the pharmaceutical one the pharmacy one
okay then kerja ini kat mana
oh dekat lah
pukul sembilan eight thirty
you've been closer right every time sekarang I always saw you and
that's why selalu macam spend time sama sama
dia pun holiday ke
ya that's why that's why macam selalu when I see your InstaStory macam eh
apasal seh
oh gitu eh macam mata merah ah kirakan
like jealous ke like oh I have a boyfriend but you don't like err
ya ya ya it's how but good thing Andy faham lah that's the thing
meet tapi masih berbual kan
like on Whatsapp or at least berbual on the phone
kau orang dua faham each other the needs and the the wants
bagus ah
show it dia punya orang dia tak tunjuk tunjukkan so
wait besides that point anyways that's not the issue the issue now is macam
together and individually so macam okay ah let's say ah so ah cause sekarang dia dah right
oh that recent stories dia tak appear lah that kind of thing okay okay
cause ah dia sekarang work as financial adviser
uh you ask me kenapa dia kerja ni pasal one day he was just scrolling through Facebook
and he saw a job ad then he just tried to apply and dia dapat ah itu jer
so sekarang dia boleh go around he can come he can go to you he can go to anybody and start selling insurance or any plans
mm so that is his career so his career now kan dia ah dia
uh gender and everything else so macam
kita is fourth we're this October we're coming the fourth year already
ya ya so ah so macam macam mana eh
okay so suddenly actually this thing doesn't only happen once during his pun pernah happen I don't know eh
so macam this thing happen for the third time already
so uh basically dia dia bilang me Hans punya type punya orang is dia he's very honest
so dia jujur dia akan bilang apa apa his perasaan everything to me
so at first bila dia cakap macam gitu I thought
tapi it's not explore means dia nak explore dia nak jumpa orang baru without feeling err bad
his dia ada group of volunteer corps do you know what is volunteer corps means you volunteer for
so when he met new group of girls then tiba tiba dia macam
wow macam okay sure
then that's the first time it happened when it first time it happened okay lah sakit hati tu sakit hati lah tapi at least
it it did hurt me but it was the first time so macam okay first time let it go that kind of thing
ya but that someone that lady dia macam
dia macam sampai berbual on dia macam my no ah like
memang dia they know each other on phone I mean they know their phone numbers so
like made a move lah macam message lah message the perempuan nak nak know better
kelakar kan
it's just dia punya tiba tiba the way dia layan me the way he he behave around me change
macam in terms of not good lah macam macam he he he he tell me things like err I want to explore he don't want to feel
get it because in this in dia punya line of job dia akan jumpa
betul lah ya lah professional that part it is lah but at the same time dia nak
at any point of time in his life dia akan jumpa sesiapa yang better than me that kind of thing
I said that thing tu juga I said macam I I say to him ah I also can say the same thing to you what but I choose to focus what is in front of me
from the start of the relationship I got even I pernah bilang you what bila kita nak
boleh lah I mean you nak comment pun comment lah because honestly
ya and there's no there's no end to it macam there's no conclusion there's a closure there's a closure in terms of how we feel
but conclusion macam do we still want each other do we still want what we have or do do do do do you still want to go on with like endless
ya so so macam
macam okay
macam dependent lah
bukan macam okay so
ya ah so macam my end goal in this relationship okay let's say to get married and stuff
it's stupid lah tapi macam
ya lah faham lah
dia belum kan
ya lah faham lah but at least now kau orang at least ada ada so called same goal in the relationship right
get it macam
for me now with Han is really macam
a total switch a total change of goals which is now tak match
I don't know lah I really don't know I don't know whether kita are compatible or what already lah because dia memang dah ada other mindset juga
spend time yes tapi macam other stuff to talk about the future no lah because dia punya parents obviously is supportive of Hans
like a like a person like like a gundu like that tunggu macam macam
macam badut gitu but the uh
it has been weeks already ah so if I cry now also macam
it's just tears eh macam really legit sia so macam ya lah
so well I'm just updating you my relationship status so kalau we ever have another family gathering then suddenly very awkward why no Hans already now you understand lah
tak apa uh it's okay not to make assumption ah but
kalau kita so called if we reach to a to a level where we break up right
ya so but this thing is special case I told Hans the same thing if I ever break up with you I will totally cut my ties with you then dia macam disagree ah dia cakap
uh hmm no he I don't know dia cakap um why it doesn't makes sense why can't we just um be friends
we have the same clique we have this the same a lot of things so macam
if I cut ties it means I have to sacrifice in terms of kalau dia orang hang out and there's Hans I might
I might think twice of hanging to hang out macam gitu mm
I mm only just now I met him lah after like a week tak jumpa
but few days ago when my friend ajak me hang out then I asked ada siapa kalau ada Hans I say to them I tak nak join
mm tapi ya ini susah ah susah
she she sense it lah so macam mm
the group of friends yang I bilang pun macam
so this issue macam I really tak nak bilang orang but
ya tak lah I think pasal I'm just too macam
even though people can say girl you are still twenty two masih boleh jumpa orang lain and stuff tapi
ya ah so ya dah itu jer lah
kadang kadang seh dalam kerja so macam if I don't have any ideas right like for example if I zone out ah
then suddenly benda tu come in
then when benda tu come in I need to talk to that guy then when I need to talk to him then negativity kicks in then from there
it affect the whole thing then that is why when tadi you bilang me kan ah what time you sleep and stuff right
twelve tahu
sometimes I habis kerja dalam pukul sembilan
lepas tu I'll just hang out talk I just like err but sometimes I have Zoom meetings so macam
okay I do Zoom meetings at at the office then I just chill then wait a bit more then I baru balik that kind of thing then once I go home
then it affected my work in terms of productivity lah I lupa benda I forget things I forgot what to do and shit
ah your rumah macam tukar hari hari seh
then before raya I think I went to your house once also different theme then raya also different theme
then sekarang
it's only your room tak involved lah
but the thing is I don't like to work in my bilik pasal wifi tak strong legit tak strong
ya mm me me and my adik already had this conversation but we're not doing it so ya that's all
because this wifi sucks you okay for example ah kalau sekarang you go to my house you sleep on my bed you are using your data already
I always do outside kalau tak I'll just do at other places
so macam jauh gila kalau nak pergi to my room
mm patutlah boleh lah gitu ya then I need to pasang one more loh
tak ada lah but
just now punya meeting is just a normal work meeting
crazy kan no it's macam gini so you kerja macam biasa
like on the same track check in apa task you buat ah
macam gitu lah penat seh so it's like technically you're working twenty four hours
they also have still to do they still need to do their kerja kerja biasa
that is why at night we need to do meeting pasal everyone will be in the meeting because at the office we will never meet each other
macam gitu lah ya ya ya correct correct ya
err at pukul sepuluh no worry lah can can
err macam jadi inspection macam inspect the homeless ah I don't know lah apa lah
merepek gila ah because I mean we have to do this cause to maintain our
oh so you your pay macam mana bila internship
wow ya it's just it's just poly things poly memang
is it tak tahu lah sekali five hundred juga eh
ah then go ahead bro ambil jer
ya then after that you can decide bila you nak continue degree or
you're you're the type yang boleh belajar what I'm not so
no need lah ah now I'm like thinking nak ambil ke tak ah tapi tak apa lah no need ah
ya I'm thinking of that lah but tengok ah
mm tengok yang last sekali
mm nasi ayam
sustenance wise memang boleh lah tapi kalau fikir sangat pasal
the taste I think can be very boring cepat muak as well
hmm I don't really like mee kuning
boleh lah
peliknya ah do
and I tak faham dia cakap pasal apa
steamboat macam dekat
ada wire
itu lah kalau lama-lama nanti sesak hidung mm
mm ya good first time lah tak pernah try mala
tetapi kan
pun boleh kata macam muak juga lah
tak boleh lama-lama sangat lah makan
tetapi ini sedap lah
rasa sikit-sikit kan
ya so kalau private they
dah bagi timing lah nak datang hari apa and at what time
oh macam acid reflux ah
I kena malam itu just berapa like a few nights ago ugh
lepas itu nak kena bangun pagi untuk kelas like pukul lapan or
mm nak
tetapi kan takkan setakat nak beli satu sahaja tempat
so macam child best situation ah
err I think season four baru nak masuk
dia buat makeup dia macam itu ke
but I feel macam
I mean memang ah it's a show but it's too overplayed
macam terlalu drama lah
I know dan is jadi gossip girl tetapi macam tak make sense eh story kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku
story kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku
mm sebab boleh nampak mm
dia macam he in one scene dia pun terjekut he was
texting quote unquote texting gossip girl so dia texting diri dia sendiri lah kan
tetapi kan kalau
kalau theory is
other people were also manning the website of gossip girl boleh masuk akal
ya or macam
ya and the fact that dia dapat marry serena pun macam err
serena and then he talk trash about her dekat gossip girl
mm raccoon lah bapa dia pun sama jer
tetapi wait dia punya part
part rambut itu
no lah dia punya hairstyle dia kadang-kadang macam tak match
eh dia dalam cerita star trek
oh bukan eh
uh siapa baru give birth tak eh
oh bukan bukan dah lama dah
apa seh
I mean I'm saving up all the cerita for after exams
mm tengah belajar
so nak kena make sure lah
kena make sure betul-betul nak yes
macam interesting jer
psychology is something you can take on tapi kalau tak nak pun tak apa
time duit and betul-betul nak atau setakat fikir saja
uh well selalunya orang cakap two out of three is okay already but I think for diploma and degrees
but tak ada duit pun tak boleh ambil
ada duit ada time tapi kalau tak ada dedication macam buang masa
I think if you want to go for it just make sure you ada lah these three
perangai melayu yes
ya lah fikir pasal duit lah sekarang memang okay
but kalau nak ambil one more
and kalau
personal betul
why kenapa
tetapi kan ambil lesen
nak fikir pasal sekolah so kalau ambil lesen nanti nak kena divide
exciting itu memang lah but sekarang I pun tak ada kereta
ya tetapi kalau tak ada macam
kalau tak ada use for kereta
macam waste of time itu sahaja
ya lah I sudah biasa sangat naik public transport
yes yang pasal the drawing mm yes
it's like an accomplishment dalam hidup
not seven wonders ke
I think so wah kaabah sendiri pun tak tahu
okay so america then europe tak ada tempat lain dah ke
apa try studying
tapi itu lah
change starts with you so kalau nak start saving
mm you know boleh is very forgiving
tapi nak kena tengok juga jangan potong too close
apa semua nak kena ada allowance
so I think it got a bit derailed sebab exam kan banyak focus dekat exam so dah tak fikir sangat lah like I think
ya so I think maybe selepas
yes selepas exam maybe dapat masuk balik lah then
ya tapi bila buat sendiri is tak as senang as dia tunjuk
ya memang banyak video tetapi I underestimate how
mm I thought is macam yang
speaking of I think my kawan-kawan are planning like a dinner or something
uh tak dah bangun selepas itu tertidur tapi bangun balik dah macam terlajak
mm tengok cerita incredible tales
tapi cikgu itu forgiving lah dia cakap okay tak apa lah it's late but I will mark as present
mmhmm apa dia
err ya I agree as well belum buat banyak pun macam uh
nanti dah tak ada moral lah
ya tapi bunuh satu pun dah macam mana
otter satu biasa pun dah besar macam mana
okay lah at least dah tahu lah apa nak cakap
for me kerja dekat bakery pun masih ya allah pun masih boleh can
mm weekend shift kan of course lah weekend orang semua datang enjoy bawa family
bawa family exactly
mm tetapi
itu lah takde tempat lain ke
dah lah dah dapat hundred dollar voucher pun masih nak datang dekat bakery lagi
ah tak tahu lah nak pergi nanti macam waste pula
entah lah
eh no lah I rasa macam tak biasa saja tak biasa orang pegang
yes dia selalu
ya dia buat dekat I pakai janggut
ya lah it means memang tak biasa
tetapi ya lah I can try to biasakan
I mean apart spa you got any nowhere else to go ke
kalau ada bathtub boleh buat air panas apa
soak sahaja lah dengan sabun semua
ya hari itu I baru nampak gambar fireworks I pergi dengan kawan I for twenty twenty
then sekarang macam ini condition ya allah
I pun nak tahu this this
uh december new year macam mana
itu lah
macam concept of time macam lost you tahu
mesti benda kemaruk seh
well I think for me this year is a lot of change I mean I thought tak masuk sekolah seh
and then sekali dapat masuk poly
banyak nama lah dia
itu lah
then dia balik
tetapi the next morning dia dah tak ada dah
tetapi mama tak ada kan so dapat I
eh still I I basuhkan dia apa
daripada kindergarten K two
yes sana kan menengah lima
ya dia dia dia mati tua lah
tua tapi tak tak pandai jaga lah
no kita orang ini
tetapi kan sebab kan pasal kucing kucing macam ini it makes me realize that I will not take a pet
bila dah hidup sendiri kan tak akan ambil
mm tetapi kalau fikir balik kan if you're not there at home is
what's the point and ya menyeksa lagi ada
walaupun kucing boleh hidup sendiri daripada anjing kan
mm tetapi if you're not home
tetapi nak kena ingat juga it's a living thing
ada corner lah
ya lah there's no saturation of market lah dah tak ada orang nak beli and daripada
and kalau tak jadi pun lagi satu hal
ya then better tak payah lah this is already perfect this is nice already
mm sejuk
tetapi selalu ada orang masak curry
ya pernah ada orang itu masak curry satu malam semalam bau lepas itu I tidur bilik you
ya satu malam dia buat mm macam apa lah dia nak buat ini
lepas itu I tidur bilik you apa sebab itu lah
you tidur kat luar sebab panas
atau you nak buat kerja I pun tak tahu
mm tingkap buatkan bilik nampak besar apa
okay so is actually um in which year eh you nak get married eh
err you also have to think this if you are staying like in one year's time then you need to find a a bilik or a room yang like you actually both are more comfortable to stay with lah correct or no
ya lah correct lah tapi sekarang I think you you both have to think what's the budget lah so budget actually berapa is it a combined wedding ke</malay
mm okay okay lah then I think kita we have to take a look part by part lah kan like for example K now a wedding will come first before the house right so and um so basically is between like err in six months time can you get the new flat is that correc
if the business already there then okay there's a plus point so I think at least the renovation will be on the kitchen so if you ask me the kitchen you need kan macam lik
which one you want to cut down ah on the on on itself like it's like flat versus wedding so if let's say uh if you ask me then of course I will choose the flat lah because apparently like macam flat kita nak tinggal sepanjang hayat chey sepanjang hayat ah
like I say uh the the most important thing is the the the nikah itself only so other the miscellaneous take photos okay that's another to me i
um family support have to come in so that's why that day you all kena macam plan budget like how much like per per side can contribute with their family already inside the picture lah that one have to be very like um
um very like uh transparent but in the event if let's say both side macam let's say for example your parents either deal with their own ideology or plan of their wedding the
you ada your own plan of your uh I mean his side ada dia punya own plan of ideology then I think the only thing you have to fikir or think about i
parents like okay maybe I can only afford to pay for how many guest then the rest you can absorb tak so that is another another way lah kan macam kita nak um try to put everything in hand lah
so wedding time at least your side macam okay then for your side uh you and your family then like for use okay I can only pay for hundred guests then if your father say okay another hundred guests I can top up your father say like that then is if sometime
you may say that having a separate cost more but you will depend on the individual side of budget eh sometimes kita kena fikir that in terms o
this is something sensitive in even in our culture in kita punya err orang melayu kita macam sensitive ah about duit ni so I think you all have t
considered in the air because like right now both families belum sit down and really get to know each other you know even like for me and my brothe
about duit pun kita adik-beradik masih sensitive tak boleh macam eh just bang aku mau pinjam duit kau lah satu ribu macam suka suka jer nak minta kan abang you know I have to be like more tactful to u
kak are you okay if I pay down then I will I will lay down what I can afford then in at least is like more clear cut tapi kalau macam</malay
like in this case lagi the other party yang your parents belum kenal kan and then the breedlove assumption the so I thin
then how much your both parents can fork out together so if let's say you dah sample among all again okay lah kita work combine then okay celebrate buat combine tapi if let's say oh
ah you know lah I still want my one thousand guest let's say hairin punya side the
your mother say okay tak apa lah based on your budget kita invite saudara mara dekat jer one hundred okay then you do separately because let's say his mother say okay then I will pay for tha
because there are two factors you need to think first um kita tak nak mengecewakan hati siapa siapa pihak because you all just become a new family member secon
like want to have a fresh new beginning with a very good fit startup lah tak nak macam semua gaduh gaduh then after this the next time dia pergi rumah</malay
like macam err
tak tahu lah macam waterfall at that I find it or even tsunami so offence already like I will just like get err
and then july got a flat ah my kita punya timeline two years tu nak engage</malay
you know then tak tahu macam mana tahu bought flat then because ah because atuk said better
cepat cepat nikah dapat rumah sendiri then after that we are like ha
then like that everything all my plan with your uncle semua macam dah haywire all I received only fla
kita punya like dream wedding kita punya dream vacation semua macam dah flash toilet jer tu begitu ah so it's lik
I I'm quite fortunate like I have support or family so like macam ah my father know that he will pay off my wedding expenses whereas for I will just focu
um makanan tapi kan shamefully I have to admit even I dah work that time kan I tak boleh afford tau because I just start my work the
and I'm about to save so like macam even like you know the bridal like you all have all these ah then I think I can only afford the photos begitu that's all with with my husband then I think my husband that time even hantaran nak exchange ah
um I think quite I I would say I like macam drag it lah but I think about it because in the end like we don't really can afford even for exchange of hantaran I think in the en
then because the the story was that that we will promise that some sustain law said okay lah why not kita combine kita beli dorang dorang hadiah untuk exchange hantaran</malay
uh the equipment that include all the err the kompang and everything I think some weddings some packages inclusive some are not so kita kena tengok macam mana lah kan so is lik
orang melayu kita ni actually err come with a lot of err gotong royong even though kita tak sekampung lah not inside you won't believe right so the thing i
relative will still to will be okay to like macam pinjamkan kereta you know so when if you no
err how to say farah see you just like okay lah whatever people uh rent you okay lah something like that so if let's say like your your your parents like know like macam</malay
uh certain relative got this car whatever they say eh I chope your car dulu for the coming wedding can or not just ask lah
you know or maybe like dekat dekat wedding tu you ask becaus
uh dulu I in this case usually lah people will still be alright to loan for wedding car then you just lik
uh we're not that chinese must be like Mercedes-Benz or Jaguar lah pe seh joke ah I'm not racist tau but I'm talking about culturally we no need to be like so branded indicative kind of of stereotyping that kind of thing lah so it was just like kita like just focu
ataupun early january next year you and your partner must how much you all can fork out agak agak because by that time you dah start your full time job okay then he already has its sort of monthly berapa one month berapa dapat sav
so basically you can agak agak already estimated amount that you can reach between end of twenty next year is what twenty twenty one ah
this one take time lah but again uh I think hairin uh or or hairin lah siapa lah uh maybe is t
because this part I think you really cannot butt in yet because uh you ini kan actually masih macam saudara baru dalam keluarga tu</malay
so memang lah nak kena macam jaga-jaga jugaa lah kan yang mereka seems like okay okay tapi tak okay kot</malay
ya memang lah um to plan the wedding is not very easy so I think is one phase at a time but despite all these challenges must really look at it like macam secara positive ya so at least that macam you know what you can um do best within this err
uh constrain the constraints of it then from there you workout on it lah so let's talk about happy things lah macam stress jer cerita cerita macam begini kita buat cerita cerita happy pulak dalam pasal pasal wedding ni</malay
so kirakan okay actually that time you got share with me kan tentang mak andam like quality of mak andam</malay
ya okay macam itu kira not too bad lah kan because anyway the number of guest is being cut down ya actually if you ask me if you want to make use of the pandemic als
very good if you you all like macam prepare and then both both parents are okay ah it's just anyway you also have time also nak save money you kno
the money surplus keep first can go for honeymoon because I'm pretty sure by that time maybe can go new zealand because um certain country dah already open kan so macam you can just like chill relax lah macam</malay
tak payah lah macam nak fikir fikir sangat kan then after that at the same time there's another part of money can still keep saving for one year for the house ah that's another advantage lah
ah ini pun if let's say both side okay lah I know it like I think both of you you both of you I think you will like kita macam like okay jer like nikah is that correc
oh I think that part can't be helped right we all memang lah keluarga melayu ni mesti nak macam happy happ
know you are like can can just like uh kita sama sama you know ramai ramai meraikan chey macam meraikan ilmu pulak tak ada lah saja mengeratkan silaturahim so I think can lah I think we jus
ah but now I think for now don't take it as uh macam sedih nak kahwin kan you just more like if all the all the err apa ni restriction constraint you just take it like what can be done during that point that point of time lah
ya so I think for you for now don't stress too much but it's just that you all just save as much but you both kena bincang</malay
sebaiknya like what can you like save like within a month you know and then what to work on the next next month macam kena ada like your own goals lah but if let's say if both of you like very nekad</malay
or very determine like what you want nak buat kan like macam tak kisahlah apa orang nak cakap kan biarlah you know so basically you just can just ignore and then you all like determine what you all want to hav
um to prioritise lah then kalau let's say family kata oh no no no no I just want to have the big wedding you know you have to then you just sit lah ah okay option one I let go the fla
ah that's another option lah that means to get a resale flat maybe dalam three five years that macam ah you know our relativ
some of them ada so you can have like that or another one that you also can have like uh just a another second option you tell them okay I can have only this budget both of u
you know ah sendiri sendiri yang macam nak spend lah so if let's say if this side kata okay boleh ah can we can come out each another to ten thousand ten thousan
ah then okay then so semua boleh centralised atau pun nak separate itu another one lah ah because I thin
about tunang he can never be meet everywhere lah kan like macam semua happ
then that that is the fact in life I think it's very very difficult you cannot make everyone happy so I think we can only do what is the best of the situation kalau let's say macam boleh</malay
then okay loh kalau tak boleh oh too bad lah because um either or I think there's only some loss factor for example if they use option on
for you to uh come back and then apply again for another flat there is another factor lah okay then if there's an option two that both parties cakap okay lah why not we bought uh you know yang</malay
norms lah sederhana jer like very minimal number of um err what you call number of peopl
then after that then that's it lah finish okay dah tak ada lagi lah that is the the the point of it ya so that is one of i
then that means but you prefer you talk to your parents both of you like macam tahu okay kita ada this amount kita ada ni kita boleh prepare macam ini ah then ah
orang ah orang mampu macam ini jer lah kan like it's like you know we can't be bo chap in everything sebab we just have to be like telling what we hav
on the table then after that err you apa ni</malay
err for you both all you want is just nikah maybe take beautiful pictures go err nice honeymoon then dah habis then after that focus kat rumah</malay
oh okay okay mas kahwin is err more important than hantaran hantaran is culture mas kahwin is agama</malay
ah so mas kahwin is part of the err macam dalam dalam term dia dalam arab is called maha</malay
so maha is the compulsory amount that you supposed to provide so the amount yang kita dapat tu minimum is actually is if I am not mistaken yang kasi the minimum amount then other than that above is up to yo
ah you know so that is the the initial so in ya I think in don't know which negeri ya dia orang lagi emphasise mas kahwin then a gift gift tu hantaran lah bagi dia orang ah that is culture melayu kita ni terbalik ah
macam ah gift tu lebih high daripada mas kahwin but right it should be another way but I think err mas kahwin ke</malay
err hantaran err for me lah I think it all depends on the affordability yes correct to have that amount is for you your parents cakap tak nak ambil kan tapi the thing i
even for you the amount to them is a a stipulated savings that you can have one shot for your house but I think along the way err sometimes rilek jer lah
err you can have the best of both worlds kan jadi kita kena tengok mana yang lagi important lah kan ah
that's why I said despite the whole thing now seems already dah pening kepala lah kan like very um you know so you you just got to doa for awhile rilek you know don't need to thin
err so in detail yet but at least to think okay now macam okay ah you know what is among all these things yang macam</malay
like you can because you think things that you can control macam budget photographer your brother ah these are the things that no need to involve family wha
like bridal studio photo or this not belong to family right even the exchange of hantaran also not belong to family so anyone want to give extra is a plus poin
but other than that ah if let's say for example ah we exchange err three saja lah item let's say for exampl
okay ah for example a'ah cuma satu I this one I don't know eh dulu I should have known luckily I never ah exchanged quran do you know that what is i
like uh okay so jada is common tapi seh jada kita tahu you will be used for um after marriage in when we play together but when talking about quran and something like actually you must actually reflect the whole when you hantar al quran</malay
you mean the hantaran</malay
oh duit that one that one is the mas eh ini not mas kan that one is err alah hantaran lah ya lah but some give cheque ah nowaday
or can be just a cheque amount ya that is one thing of it lah ya if you ask me can be cheque kosong ha ha ha ha
cheque kosong what but inside is PayNow leh is direct transfe
ah so is all depends lah but again if follow tradition ya lah they want to see for real to sure masih cash you know you know bank not
like a normal cheque just to display in fact if you ask me a paper also okay but mesti there's a transaction and PayNow
mm it happens ah actually happens during my time also is like oh because they only said lah when you actually in engagement phase that there's a lot of challenges gaming up coming up so ah ya lah macam</malay
like you say like you know some can we stand some cannot tapi to know each other's partner is very very important so i
so I think like this uh family support is one factor very very important to me lah that's why err I mean culturally kita melayu is very united satu hati lah kan macam like kita you know lah we are lik
we always like um always don't forget like what to do I mean what to to help out even like with friends you know like we hear when peoples susah even like just now you say comments comments just now righ
not none of our business also lah but the thing is like people also like sibuk and go and go and comment y
oh it depends some some partners maybe like they do in front of you like they buy you lavishly and all that tapi out there maybe dia pakai card card card tapi tak shar
per per per person or individual like that like macam tak tunjuk lah kan macam</malay
err like no communication with their families feel like tak tunjuk or what lah ya so that can happen tau macam</malay
tak tak tak ada then why you ask me after seven years dating pun tak tahu dia ni buat apa ke kaya ke kan maybe all the while the guy only show up front oh aku ada hadiahkan best best you kno
ah dia bukan pun tak tunjuk kind of thing some some can leave that up staging on staging eh macam berlakon staging up everyday which like to me it's excruciating ah but some people ya carry on maybe like for example dia partner no ah
the other party tu tak ada duit maybe tak you know not affordable or whatever but she she will ask and then she always try to give her so he thought or maybe lah should be okay lah nanti kahwin pun okay lah macam sekarang</malay
um he has so many money aku minta pun okay jer ah you know sounds like but I the end when the person say oh uh he's in debt for the wedding ini ya actually that is not the only on
I think dari zaman our grandfather they are always this occasion people last time if you watch P ramlee sho
ah lie lah borrow the chetty lah you know that that particular chetty will always just borrow lend the money to them what um high interest and then end up hutang because because our tradition that our culture that sometim
then like for example ya you you want to prioritise on this you have to have budget and so is it again like assist supporting the family lah kalau family understand family tahu what you can what you cannot and the
it's okay we'll like for example like a friend of mine both of them wah very have good job then they get flat dengan with their pa
so there's uh about three months is like or four months ya tak start he take a break but he got ready a job to start later on so he used tha
that's why he told me lah kan so like macam very kelakar then I was like abby you all gaji seventy eight thousand dah
then like let me oh mampus ah like that like that then he said no lah it's just tha
the you earn actually the more expenses we have you know like uh like macam peribahasa melayu apa the apa kerak nasi makin tebal makin</malay
ah tak tahu lah don't know lah there's this particular you know so basically this is the this is the part that he always remind me that lah which I always think oh
to know you usually parents ah whether to let go kids to kahwin I think me as a parent I will only see whether are you ready financially emotionall
if financially you okay then no need to be so damn rich lah right no need to be like so kaya or whatever you just need to have like um
ah more than enough like can start lah macam you can pay your bills you know you can you can uh you can have a proper food you know don't end up like until like when you have kid
err want to want to buy a normal sayur or kangkung</malay
um when you work you have to think is I always remind that's why like when when when my anak when all of you come to me my anak anak saudara ask me about weddin
my concept is what is your vision apakah your punya vision to achieve in building live together if your vision is to hav
okay a stable marriage a stable home then to me is wedding to have a lavish or not is secondary because bottom line you want to stable yourself you nak make sure tha
you start something that with no hutang you know because basically you you start something with hutang you got headach
I am not saying when you are together you know hutang lah kan you will have you got kids already hutang will be there bu
is not as if you are not able to pay that's the only thing lah ah because memang ah kalau memang kita ada segalanya memang ah kalau kita anak anak sultan johor ke daughters sultan daughters of sultan johor can lah
but the thing don't let it kill you lah that's why I said err in this case kan suka ke tidak instrinsic back breakdown tu kena ada</malay
ah introduce you must have really must have because if not lah if you ask me lah wah very jialat lah like every everything also must risau bu
what can be cut down what can don't need to cut down I mean kita tak boleh convince like that macam like for example ah you kno
fathers oh mesti nak ada lima ratus okay bu
because you already give a picture you know what can be done what cannot be done then your parents ah okay lah boleh lah boleh lah sembarang ah he will come to a point like that I know my brothe
like he will come to a point apa-apa suka hati okay lah korang dah plan kan okay okay tak apa</malay
ah engkau continue okay I will I will support you it will come to that bottom lin
then after a while kan dia err
it got to a point that dia macam super nonsense
no but I um the the the first wife I don't know ah like apa motive dia buat macam gitu semua kan
dia nak apa revenge
so dia don't love the husband anymore
so dia just nak revenge only
I don't know that's where I'm confused about like whether dia fall in love with the colleague or
habis um so the guy love her or don't love her the guy like her or don't like her
then why the guy still jumpa with the shermaine and all
dia kan jumpa with the
the han so hee punya bapa
they meet and then after that err macam they the the guy the new guy share information with
ni wife punya bapa
the show is good you know the first few episodes was so good you know that I really want to watch I really want to keep watching and watching kan tapi after awhile
no it's not about the episodes it's about the way they run the show like the was so good ya the story line was so good tapi after awhile it's just so merepek
we watched that so many times and I still cry tu so sekarang I'm watching cerita reply nineteen ninety eight have you watched that
um ah there's dia ada reply nineteen ninety four reply nineteen ninety seven and reply nineteen ninety eh nineteen eighty eight
but no doubt ah princess hours macam is the best ever
ya I watched that bila I'm sec two when I was sec two sec one sec two
you no you why you don't let him ah apa
uh it's not a severe case sorry cause yours only is on here only kat sini macam still have nothing
mm you can go there lah because my sister-in-law kamifie kan dia dulu ada ah macam like yours ah acne like that kan
but at the cheek you know like cheek only I I don't know I forgot but you know the macam termasuk termasuk punya
I think so but it's termasuk you know after after it cured right it
ya like termasuk sikit jer then dekat atas nothing you know nose nothing just the cheek you know
so she went to some aesthetic clinic and then err she paid like few thousand she keep macam dia orang keep inject here inject there but
so after that she said macam okay ah let's do it lah just go national skin centre and then within three months kan the skin really clear up you know
but the first two weeks kan dia punya skin really flared up macam teruk gila macam I think the medicine they use
release all for the first two weeks kan macam teruk gila you know she looks so swollen but
no I don't know but you know kalau if I have that problem right I can actually help you because I can
tapi I have there tengok ni macam
I think I want to buy Cetaphil and I want to buy apa um yang scrub scrub juga tu
I think my skin cannot kena Cosrx eh
tapi Cosrx I need to use for a few days baru that pimple will just go away
oh ya cystic habis that one see
before my marriage kan my face quite kotor also
no no no no the people say people say after beranak then like after you give birth

if not I use plaster on my face if no plaster pun I just go I don't care
oh they say kan they say it's not because of apa
it's not pasal
yang pakai makeup it's about
you you use it sampai habis eh
no because kan sebab I don't like to I didn't like using that because it's thick I mean macam
I used the balm I feel like macam err I think I felt that
because kan bila tengah kerja that time when before this COVID when I was at work kan when I go to work
I used makeup then balik I have to use makeup remover remover kan so my
skin eh so I find that it's super flawless cuma
your skin is lagi teruk
so kau tak pakai makeup it's tak rabak
I think dekat atas pun dah mati tau
cuma left this one and that one only
no you know I ah I use plaster yang dia punya the transparent one the transparent area
no because the bandage area kan is for yang besar punya pimple that if I can cover that tapi kalau yang kecil punya kan if I cut small then they cannot stick what
I use I do a lot of things back then macam one of those
plaster kan macam gini kan then in the middle is the white colour kan I will cut like macam
four become kecil and then the part then the putih there on the side itu then I will cut like four
strips also then I will just tutup

ah fifteen minutes twenty fifteen minutes boleh ah fifteen minutes
if aku
aku not sure sia
do kau have something in mind I'm really not sure sia
especially kau dengar Converse seven to ten august that time
tak tahu tadi terhang sikit ah eh
I'd say looks ah cause honestly body you can do anytime but if your looks rabak kan and your face ah that's it got nothing to do already just give up unless
body can do anytime makan makan makan
how about kau
wah bagus bagus abeh honest eh
it's just aku rasa mainly cause of apa body type is it that kind of thing
ah yes I mean at that point of time pun kan so like kau just need more experience a little bit more experience that's all
kau tengah cakap pasal which food court ada
yes is it that one yang kau tengah cakap that food court
dorang taruk those uh what do they call that
like feed properly the chicken that kind of thing kan bukan macam give them some
air and
kau punya melayu hancur sia apa yang oksigen apa sia
I aku tak pernah sia cakap like oksigen like
ever in malay maybe that's why aku tak tahu ah this is my honestly my first time hearing it
exactly and the fact that macam mana eh all those dormitory workers
but it's just sad that they have to live inside there until aku tak tahu bila
actually that's what they should do sia after like phase two pasal kita semua quarantine kat rumah kan and shit
then you slowly move to phase two which is yang kau cakap implement tu and then slowly gradually macam sekarang ah
tapi sekarang tak lepas phase two jer semua orang keluar
but you know the problem now is also pasal
older generations them and their phone tak payah cakap ah
aku pernah experience like customers old auntie lah
kau pun heard ah the reason they
pun is just cause the economy is dropping that's all
oh ya ya aku nampak
at least also like go out with a purpose are ada orang just keluar setakat untuk lepak
ah yes okay ya betul betul betul
kau nampak national day
as in like tak yah cakap ah
like a lot of people then aku nampak like a tweet on Twitter that says like
because nobody is following the safety measure rules whatsoever one metre apart takde jer semua lama just one big ass
ah takpe lah president
eh but area kau ada fireworks
but like you know romantics sikit who knows bring you to bali
I would like settle down if one country if one country aku boleh settle down kan aku would settle down at
have you seen the mountains there just online aku macam
but if kau nak peace you know do your work alone enjoy retirement shit
that place untuk aku is perfect ah
K the other side aku dengar it's like something about
aku nak quit sia aduh
but ni macam last minute ah aku didn't know that err our school provided a bursary
cause aku didn't know until miss tan text aku like
ya I think so but then aku fikir balik eh bukan aku dah nak graduate april oh sekarang jer baru dia nak bagi
oh nenek eh kau tinggal sorang kan dalam
asal room kau gelap sia kau tak
oh takde apa
subuh so technically kau should
aku nya time eh
eh hamzah um that time bapak have the iphone eleven the plan um starhub
um iphone eleven know got sale ah macam tak sure kalau um the plan worth it or not because now my plan I think is um twenty five dollars
think like macam I think about ten ah
macam wasted kan gitu so calculate um macam
um so that means I one month macam about extra thirty dollars then kalau dua tahun
nanti ah nanti tanya bapak uh I think he he save a voucher or what
but for me I I use only macam about ten gitu lah
ah tak banyak ah ah
phone ni six S plus ah I think since um which year ah since twenty sixteen uh remember that time we go which wedding ah medan ah medan ingat
ah siapa namanya kahwin tu kak lia eh kak lia kan
ah medan ah that time so that time I think eh that no that time medan twenty seventeen twenty fifteen eh tak tak sure ah twenty sixteen kan
oh no I don't want upgrade it's maybe four years ah macam gitu ah
the lowest the lowest macam fifty five dollars jer yang the next expensive one is I think eighty kan something like eighty ah ya but I don't want I don't need the what data what thirty all this thirty
tak pakai pun kan
bila dia dia ah bila keluar ah when bila release
but the specs um similar to uh yang which iphone
actually ada ada iphone eight plus tak ada kan
oh masih ada lagi eh
um mana yang lagi mahal um iphone eight or
iphone eight iphone eight ada tu kan face face kan
I think iphone ten pon ada kan uh face
ambil iphone ten ah pelik ah
oh uh today pergi sekolah apa
kerja ah
oh so how many ah dua kali ah one week one week dua kali ah
ah interview maybe yang second time ah second time dia orang suruh ambil this kind
no I mean uh bukan yang bukan tau the the one at uh what you call that
that one you that one tak boleh search apa online
um tak
yesterday there's ada satu interview eh recruiter kan
what's the word ah macam
like you know like you ask them to call back kan abeh dia cakap ah no only two minutes macam a bit annoying ah you know
orang melayu cakap um jangan apa
most of the job dia orang cakap aiya it's like contract it's not really ah
that is that makes sense what kalau tak nobody will also macam
full time but because sekarang kan I teach tuition kan
no but tuition only left lagi dua bulan ah until um october kan O level atau N level kan
last week I just start um this new student ah budak melayu ah budak apa N level ah N level dekat bukit batok
no I think now they they make more centres ah I think they I think dia orang there's no way they can do in a big hall what kan
then yang students yang lain all pergi normal classroom ah
I think same time ah the the whole singapore mesti same time what kalau tak later how to know that you know
I think part time got got a a lot job ah macam yang this um
kat mana eh um
for part time mesti commit
for me best is um data analsyt atau business analyst
atau system analyst ah
kena twenty four seven support
it's like like to me not much difference right kalau work from home then
I think python macam python for me is okay lah because it's a
actually high level is the the code that macam can be readable kan so kalau macam if a human being baca the code
ah there's this code thing called fortran right betul tak
then what ni apa this there's this language namanya C hash eh apa C hash eh is it
but it's um the pace is what like dia ikut which um which language
I don't really like to like build you know macam build all the app
ingat tak um during the year twenty
my job mostly like ah then investigate ah gitu
ah error error dia akan email kan so times ten kan times ten
like macam need to find the what they call it the the root cause analysis
like enriching to do this kind of work but yang tak suka is the I really benci is support twenty four seven on the phone ah
the like not say down time ah macam
nenek boleh pergi balik ah nenek
um I think tak boleh ah but eh but dia right yang syakilah iman is maybe ah I think
eh I I think already six months they never collect the mailbox I think berlambak ah mail dia
no ah oh auntie I always just say cik cik rozi ah cakap something ah
then dah you all dah makan belum
semua tengah tidur kan
tak dia punya ingredients kan beli kat pasar atau uh
you mean the ikan is the the one that is boneless eh
um mesti
ya the sauce right then pour on top kan just just tuang
I think just but the sweet and sour you can make ah macam mix and match
apa apa ya like
tomato semua ah tomato um pineapple
ah capsicum sedap I like I like the capsicum
the yang makan masa ah kan
for for us actually if let's say our our family kan macam nak ada maid kan
kalau siapa dah kahwin kan atau like we have our own house kan maybe separate ah let's say I
no I mean like one maid ah because like the maid tak payah just stay at one house do all the work what because sometimes mak ada nenek ada kan so maybe can
the maid is okay then we we must bayar for the transport
and maybe give them time off ah kan kalau
tak complain atau tak
feel macam pressure kan we we like they call it give and take ah
don't over over work the maid lah kalau maid is okay then okay what you know
this one maybe we can plan ten ah next time because bapak kan dah tua<malay kan nanti mak
like at least like the maid boleh masakkan actually the best kan the maid masak
right because if the maid masak right then we just need to buy the stuff ah then sekarang
tak payah leceh pergi kedai apa kita boleh just order online kan
but any online pasar or not macam pasar food eh buy meat or chicken ada eh
but I mean like the betul punya pasar online maybe maybe
no because fairprice jual beef tak eh because beef is very hard to find right
um macam mana the person tahu
oh no oh but means the device kan then the the user mesti jalan to
our our house all small what america everything is so big kan I mean america everything you see dia punya rumah besar-besar or I think european some also the house big kan
but the device is uh quite mahal kan I think thousands right
so seven days tak payah pergi kerja ah just somewhere else ah
itu hari cakap open the ikea but oh but now open lah
so nobody can meet their friends to eat what so they just have to eat cepat-cepat makan then then just balik class ah
but that that time weird you know ah dekat mana eh
apa nama kedai dia yang mister you you know orchid house dekat serangoon gardens tu
orchid house the the indian food macam mamak ah
mamak food
al-azhar gitu those kind macam woodgrove gitu ah
phase the first week of phase two kan atau I think I jumpa my friend during the phase two second week ah kan
phase two is about nineteen june kan so about late about twenty seven or twenty eight june I go out my my friend makan dekat tu ah orchid house
pelik ke so that means there's you cannot communicate like weird ah kan
mesti customer complain or next time they choose somewhere else kan because
because of the apa seating arrangement
and some people they apa like they in a group kan say eight people ah four four kan
they are together but then they sit separately but then they like can change table and then bersembang lah dengan kawan-kawan kan
um I heard the store owner kan atau business owner dia orang call the
but sometimes we think oh it's no big deal but then if everyone can do it then later next thing happen next thing that you tengok news
eh but do do you think it's possible kan kalau dia orang make a system kan means by far away then they auto checkout
ah if the person off then tak boleh ah kan
ya the the app apa what's the name of the that time they make the app singapore made the app
it's good kan macam but if that one you off or you off data cannot right
actually that one bagus tau pasal you like eh hey google then the you can play spotify
K because my my friend he dia pakai google home eh google phone tau so I use apple ah but the that time I stay punggol also share with him kan
so he use the the what google assistance eh yang cakap the voice ah
dia cakap even your google is like off or something right they still listen to you is it correct
ah macam macam mana nak tahu ah
no I mean macam mana nak nak tahu that whether they are listening to you or not
no I think if let's say oh but I think google kan macam mana eh if you like ask question kan like no need the internet you like ask for the weather right and there's no wifi then they will say um oh sorry we cannot
something basic ah like uh what time is it maybe dia tahu ah kalau tanya something like um
my friend eh my friend singaporean kan but then he dia study full time dekat pergi luar ah
then dia punya apartment kan
then dia pun ada alexa I think now alexa better ah because
I think that one bukan maybe that one is it thailand something ah I cannot remember
ah the ah the dekat mana eh ah this place ah that time I went interview tanjong pagar go it's called what guoco tower ah
so when you tap kan dia dia tahu which which place to go to ah like which lift to go to then but when you going down because when you tap means you know that is going down what
the other day was just the other day was first time first time aku turun rumah dia then after that aku try kan ah baju dia I mean dia tak pernah nampak cause COVID pe
she was satisfied with it lah which I'm I'm relief lah cause I scared macam
for baju nikah right

kat mana seh
dia macam boot
three three yes can three three laki
but dia nya location for the gym is only one place ah area
mid september I so I go home naik taxi right
and then some more my our pay is seventh of the month right so aku submit
aku submit like
and then she say it will be in ah for november pay eh ah october pay lah but I will receive in november apa
so dia pun
peng ah because dia tanya macam how much you got paid ah then after that ah he said oh
dia she just with what just graduated from poly
cause she did events management so in term of macam layan customer and all she's quite good lah like when she draft email actually not bad like no problem in terms of grammar
kesian kan entah macam bila dia datang kerja right sekarang dia datang kerja dia tak dia tak ada semangat ya demoralised I mean
wasted the cert macam tak ada guna
ah suruh dia berbual ah dengan manager cause confirm ada macam review apa dia dah habis dia nya tiga bulan
so macam sometime manager aku tanya macam okay everything okay everything okay
so kalau aku cakap dengan dia ah kalau it bothers her so much
that one point nine is just kau punya
kan aku actually kasi dia scenarios sia like some ya you try lah you try talk like that
kita kalau nak berbual kita tak boleh macam ah cakap pasal macam asal kita tak happy
yes cannot macam involve other people and knowing that they what what's their pay like because surely there is already breach of contract pe and the agreement
dia setakat hire jer
and then she said macam
dia takut ah kalau dia berbual gini
dengan manager aku ke dengan atau dia berbual dengan ke apa or maybe the boss confirm after this dia kena macam pulau
confirm kena pulau kan yes macam eh dia ni budak yang minta minta higher pay
so it's kesian ah
is not conducive at all lah I I I when I see them doing email macam annoying
yes so can you imagine you are doing email abeh you you see customer coming right
but this is not the case that's why when I see her macam one point nine is not enough sia
macam it's like a chain effect
the big bosses anuh
the another boss boss boss then after that go to manager then manager kena manager will go to us kena
second last day of january then why not then I kira kan unemployed after that ya
macam work with him lah is not work with him
then I said I I said to him lah aku aku cakap dia terus macam eh tapi kau yang ada design dia sia kau dah ada the inspiration in mind tau you already have the vision
then kau nak aku buat
tapi kalau kau nak suruh aku ambil kau nya brand I cannot
is ya is not my aku aku dah cakap dengan dia is not style then then it took him a while to understand why I
and very adamant about it lah macam
tu aku macam okay lah I just accept his offer and is going to be next year so
so I'm gonna sew for my friend her wedding dress tapi it's just dinner
because her mother is gonna knit the entire baju
so it it actually look like baju pahang the malay one yes the cutting is like the baju kurung but is all crochet and then it because she wear ah hijab right so I just gonna do macam dinner dress is like then it's just A line dress lah because
the baju kurung pahang won't look good with train what you cannot do that ya
so aku boleh I can start on
biasa lah my roller skate okay not err need
oh yes yes yes kat luar semua
I fell kat
oh best nya
let's do that that's fun cause ya I tried to roller skate I baru nak I think is fine
does it aku tak tahu sia qantas qantas lah
cause that ya I like that it's from australia aku punya pun she from australia sia
ya actually I thought seventy is standard shipping then the guy actually upgraded to express and he didn't charge me so I think I probably paid for the express shipping because the the website it didn't said macam okay standard shipping is this cost express shipping is this cost I didn't ya I didn't have an option
that's why I aku macam shock huh I get express shipping thank you lah
yes and is like cost you a bomb but I did my research what so I actually read up review whoever who bought the same brand uh of roller skates then I see macam okay most of them actually it said that is fit to your true size so you don't have to worry about sizing up or sizing down
adidas takde
okay bro aku selalu pakai size thirty nine
macam okay lah takpe lah
is nice hundred plus ah aku macam huh hundred plus previously I bought my converse is only seventy nine
yes and belakang dia macam just all star like abeh dia punya sini pendek sikit I think pendek is the sole yang pendek dah rabak kan baru beli
and the ini hitam
kalau yang dulunya merah kan yang merah biru
the the logo is tak ah is merah merah biru ah
then punya tapak dia pun tebal
bila kau dah dapat kau nya first day nanti kau beli
huh dia dia punya ni
kat right the baggage area
like macam like aku go downhill then after that aku duduk
that why I was like trying to figure out baru third day seh terus aku dah buat gitu macam ya achievement I cannot do tricks I cannot I still cannot do backward like back back skate
macam okay look at their wardrobe okay let's just wear this out
macam okay
when the time is right then they probably like imagine kalau dia dah pregnant
then oh kau apa
um wow that sounds great aku past few days aku tak buat apa-apa yang menarik sangat aku cuma duduk dekat rumah jer tengok
janganlah kita buang duit nak beli handphone yang mahal-mahal tapi tak ada lah beza sangat dengan handphone yang lama kan
mostly kalau aku boleh mimpi lah satu hari healthcare percuma lah untuk semua orang
susah kan dia orang nak afford untuk bayar dia orang punya hospital bills kan
nenek saya pun masuk hospital pun dah beberapa dah beberapa kali pasal sakit pasal jatuh
pun tak murah lah kan nak bayar dia punya itu
um obviously as of right now I don't think it's possible for anybody to be invisible so you know who knows maybe one day in the future kita boleh hilangkan diri eh in a way that
kalau aku pun aku memang nak lah sebab macam dia kata kalau during exams kalau lah masa O level aku boleh baca minda orang eh yang duduk depan aku itu budak pandai itu kalau aku boleh baca minda dia mana tahu aku punya results lagi bagus daripada sekarang ke
ya betul-betul boleh baca minda kawan lah kalau dia tengah tipu ke kalau dia tengah jujur ke tak tahu lah kalau orang ini berbual merepek ke you know I mean I guess mind reading is I'd say is pretty powerful to be honest but who knows maybe someday
yang pertama if kalau boleh aku nak
dapat cepat-cepat belajar apa-apa bahasa dalam dunia lah sebab pertama sekali um daripada kecil dulu pergi kelas madrasah selalu dapat dan sudah dapat belajar bahasa arab tapi sampai sekarang pun masih tak boleh err nak cakap satu ayat pun dalam bahasa arab sebab berapa susah nak belajar
so kalau ada peluang bahasa arab
bahasa german dengan italian
aku kalau boleh lah kalau dapat lah nak cuba
um master lah dengan beberapa cepat lah yang kedua kalau boleh saya nak
um belajar masak dengan betul-betul baik
macam faidil kata tadi dia boleh look up to orang macam gordon ramsay yang memang hebat sekali bila masak tapi kalau saya saya tak
ikut lah gordon ramsay kalau boleh pun saya nak ikut emak saya sahaja sebab dia memang satu inspirasi bagi saya dan
kalau saya dah ada berumahtangga kalau ada bini ke saya tak nak bini saya tanggung semua tanggungjawab untuk masak untuk kita dan anak-anak kita so
mana tahu dua tiga minggu sekali saya boleh nak memasak untuk anak kita dan iya lah dapat senangkan untuk semua orang
movie romantic ini memang aku suka lah sebab aku ini suka nangis abeh tengok cerita-cerita macam gini I mean iya lah kalau kalau aku nangis kan memang dapat rasa emosi dia lah bila tengok orang berlakon
tapi macam drama-drama melayu pun banyak dekat tiga ke malaysia astro ke dapat tengok
kebanyakkan cerita romantis kelakar lah tapi
memang aku suka lah
dengan um iya lah I mean other than romance I'd say I mean comedy would be my go to ah
kalau aku ada time capsule being the very nostalgic person I am
jadi aku boleh iya lah kalau sekarang buka aku boleh tengok lah gambar-gambar tersebut kan
and iya lah fikir lah masa sebab dulu masa kita sepuluh sembilan sepuluh tahun tak banyak stress kan dalam hidup
kalau nak bandingkan dengan sekarang tak banyak risau tak tahu apa-apa about the world we don't know how bad the world is nowadays you know just think of yourself a more carefree time
whoa memang menarik itu jawapan dia
I mean duit itu memang penting lah kalau aku aku pun nak duit lah seratus billion dollars itu memang
tak tahu lah nak buat apa eh dah terlalu banyak sangat dah duit dia
um dalam keadaan dunia ini sekarang
aku akan wish untuk semua orang
dengan stable ah sebab sekarang ini banyak orang hidup susah
dunia ini pun semakin um semakin mahal untuk tinggal dalam susah untuk keluarga untuk survive kan
so yang pertama I would wish for poverty to end cause
I mean ya um liverpool is a good club I I would like to argue with that but aku rasa chelsea itu memang aku dah lama lah sokong so aku aku tak akan tukar minda aku
aku memang aku memang jealous lah yang liverpool menang title tahun lepas
tapi aku aku rasa kalau aku control chelsea sendiri aku janji tiap-tiap tahun kita akan menang itu aku pastikan so iya lah kalau aku dah sokong itu memang aku tak akan tukar lah eh
kegemaran lah yang
eh nasi pula lauk lemak
and aku and I really like it and I do not know how to make it so
kalau kalau boleh I want to become a journalist cause
iya lah betul lah memang
betul betul betul betul judgemental kan sekarang
so kalau aku boleh pilih
kalau jujur cakap aku nak pilih badan yang sihat lah
daripada muka yang handsome lah
aku akan pilih badan yang lebih sihat lah sebab lebih susah untuk nak turunkan berat badan daripada
lebih baik lah untuk orang lain kan
kalau orang itu badan dia memang bagus ke muka dia betul-betul handsome ke
apa that personality is in someone is more important right like for us as a guy
um I just why aku rasa hidup dekat singapura ini sebagai seorang remaja memang
memang laju lah untuk senang kata lah memang laju memang banyak stress banyak yang nak buat
dan ini baru sebelum orang masuk kerja ini belum lagi masuk kerja akan dapat lebih stress
culture di pada negara-negara di asia lah sebab iya lah benda macam um kesihatan mental ini memang
bagi keluarga melayu ke dekat asia ini memang tak diambil berat lah
untuk ibu bapa kan sebab cara mereka dengan cara kita kan tak sama mereka datang daripada zaman yang mungkin lebih susah lah jadi mungkin mereka tak anggapkan kesihatan mental sebagai sesuatu yang penting lah
you wish you could have helped to avoid it but tak boleh so
yang one way or another has been at fault
um when I think about the past twenty years living in singapore I'm very I'm very thankful and memang bersyukurlah dapat pergi sekolah belajar daripada kindergarten sampai sekarang dekat sekolah poly ambil diploma
um dapat buat dengan senang tak ada tak ada bill yang mahal-mahal yang kita kena bayar macam orang yang datang dari luar negara um dekat sini pun um healthcare macam dekat polyclinic ke dekat hospital pun
kita punya apa dia kita punya government kita dapat tolong dapat cover kan dapat bantu and ada um as someone who has two siblings with special needs
and um with that both of us would like to say thank you and have a nice day thank you terima kasih bye bye

oh so you just came back from batam ah err amacam batam okay tak sekarang how is the the situation there
aku pun dah lama pun tak pergi batam
terpingin ah
dah lama sia tak pergi batam betul
COVID dah datang apa dah datang semua tak boleh pergi travel pun tak boleh itu pun tak boleh but a lot of people affected right
our friend there all err yang dekat batam semua some of the guides tour guide and then those
pakcik-pakcik yang bawa van ni semua amacam dia orang ah you still keep in touch with err all of them
you mean parking parking as in what macam jaga parking ke apa
kat barelang kan jauh but farming barelang I don't know but can do farming in indonesia what what what
dia tanam apa ah
ah err tanam papaya
and then those err macam seasonal like jagung now I think most of them is planting jagung lah or corn
uh jual pasar
massage mall shop is quiet very quiet takde orang
err because I think dulu dia orang harapkan apa
parlour over there err dah tutup
takde business
then dekat mana shopping mall err I would say
mall the mall is empty tak ramai orang
err like even on the street dekat dekat tengah jalan kat jalan tu kat nagoya tu is very quiet
I left on twenty nine october turun turun jakarta
jumpa kat jakarta then sama-sama balik err
balik balik batam
ah because nak jumpa
so they came from from from dia orang datang dari kampung
ah so jumpa dulu one or two ah one night then proceed lah
then before that you fill up so when you beli when you beli when you buy the ticket at the counter they would want to see this email
sampai kat singapore
I see is bila you dah after in front of the immigration tu there will be cisco officers lah so ah the the immigration will just go signal to them that say okay this one is like that lah
then from there I don't know macam you just wait dekat waiting area then all the all of you all of us will leave in one bus lah
but probably communicate they mention about communication wise is through err macam for me also I don't tak tahu pun where I'm going to
err they did inform ikut jer
I think but I think I think kalau kita tanya they will answer lah but then they didn't I think they are busy sorting out all the all the going here going there kan so that time communication wise I think ya
err nazi semua when you think of nazi is
not not until like that apa is all systematic what singapore
uh uh melebih melebih ah cara-cara the way they discuss sampai ah tu melebih lah kan jadi sama jer macam kita bantu tak tahu kita ikut jer pe
for me is fine but I got I got I don't know the the hotel that I'm in is a whole window so macam
I think they it helps lah dengan apa tu dengan kalau cermin is a small window cermin apa window kecil gitu I will akan rasa stress lah but but because it's a big window
so you know dapat tengok luar
tak stressful lah tu you got a lot of pass time kira kereta berapa ah that is what I do lah in the morning during err peak hours
err randomly kira-kira kereta jalan berapa banyak
macam you know alah you you you you you you are you are when you leave the country you should be prepared that you will be getting through this which is good enough that you get a good hotel a decent hotel apa
ah berpada ah you know some country another negeri dapat tempat is really really bad
for me is just alhamdulillah lah you know dapat makan you get a good hotel then after that a good bed for two weeks
I mean it's your it's choice lah how macam mana kita nak nak tu kan how how you nak nak how you want to make use of
what you have apa yang kita ada tu ah ya lah like I have for me iya lah tu lah kita duduk duduk tu kira appreciate but for me is that I got that room I I got that whole window I appreciate that very much lah
ah tak tak tak terasa terkongkong tu jer
ah sekarang jadi malas ah dah dua minggu makan tidur makan tidur sleep err
do my deliveroo lah but to do work lah so during weekend weekend nak kena kerja weekend we have to work
I work I work eh dua shift dua shift err either start at eight
err eleven so macam eight they cover breakfast kalau err
cover lunch lunch err eleven have to start all the way already lah all the way until petang ah until evening
alhamdulillah lah really really for me is that alhamdulillah macam you know you control for me is that you control how much you want to earn
you you you you know how much are you you know how much you can earn macam berapa banyak kita boleh apa kita boleh earn ah so if you you need that money if you need more you work have to work a bit hard lah
nanti nak kena fikir thinking macam mana
how is it gonna be a new year tahun ni eh
pukul satu pagi semua kat block agaknya
I believe uh macam neighbourhood ada dia punya apa tu bunga api sikit eh sikit-sikit sikit-sikit okay lah like that
singapore yang the officially close the border
macam the hundred dollars you can only take a bit a bit a bit sikit-sikit kan
tu lah that's why I'm thinking mana nak pergi
macam aduh
next year boleh after new year
apa sea aquarium uh belum pergi uh
adventure cove tak buka kan ah ah belum buka lagi ah aku tunggu juga
jap pergi supper dok just but
I think macam eh kita ni macam singaporean kan lucky lah macam beruntung
appreciate macam you should appreciate apa kita apa ni
apa yang kita dapat apa-apa what our government give us ah yes yes yes
macam how to say ah macam
dulu macam kita for last time when we are here abeh kita tengok macam tengok this year how come you know  mak dia orang ni everyday dia punya cases naik macam tak jaga kan ah but when when you are there then you realise lah err that sometimes you know it's not that they don't macam dia orang tak nak
tapi looking at their economy
and with azan lain macam dia orang kan kebanyakkannya
gaji hari then kalau kena quarantine empat belas hari
ah betul itu lah itu dia orang tu nak quarantine susah macam kalau dia orang empat belas hari siapa nak kasih makan keluarga
ah tu macam tu lah kadang-kadang bukan dua orang tak nak kan but then
negara tu kan
nak nak quarantine lah that kind of stuff
oh macam sometimes the government ada kasih until when the amount to reach them it's it's not the original amount lah
ah along along along along the way itu
ada potong potong potong itu lah situasi sebetulnya
kurang uh uh
then also masa err some of them
no they don't dia orang tak nak pergi hospital sebab
kita too negative
apparently for every untuk setiap orang yang mereka hantar to pergi refer the hospital get money
not under table is government government bayar so hospital tu hospital tu will just say you're positive
ah ah satu
I just don't know that's why for untuk orang local ini nak pergi hospital
ah and if you speak to most of them semua semua gitu ah because initially I thought this is full macam tak this is bullshit right sekali but then berbual dengan orang sana berbual lepas tu orang-orang A orang B orang C kan
they give semua jawapan semua sama dia orang takut nak pergi hospital hospital dapat duit
no they no no they they check they check lah no they check they they pergi swab test tapi came back is positive lah
but bila bila kat sana ambil dah negative
for them janji aku dapat duit sudah
uh uh takut semua orang takut
tu lah kan
kesian but kesian orang-orang yang malaysia kan
ah tu macam you saw pasal saiful punya video tu
yang sebelah causeway ah just the causeway tu
setulang dekat ah tu ah R&F dia dekat woodland woodland checkpoint tepi tu
I I think I think dia nikah kat johor
huh I think singapore I mean kat johor yang dia married
officially tu dekat johor tak johor johor mm mm
sorry dia balik
under spouse kat johor malaysia
leave dengan no pay leave lah everything for two months in malaysia ah
eh duit balik tu lagi mahal tau
uh empat ribu enam ratus I was talking to him I was I was talking to him I say
even for malaysian malaysian pun dia orang nak kena bayar I think two thousand plus eh
ya malaysia ni dia orang dia orang how to say eh kalau step step step apa macam like they are strict lah ah tempatnya I don't know ah but I think if talking about strictness lah I think malaysia lebih strict than singapore for in terms of their immigration tinggi
tapi tu lah dia orang
kat yang dalam locally tu lah
that's why told him lah you know it depends have to bayar but then
is good investment then it's worth lah you know macam your
ah duit boleh apa ah duit boleh cari but then the moment you have to treasure because
was thinking of the best if I tak if I didn't go back
maybe nak tunggu dia buka maybe two zero two two right two years
okay lah for me is for myself personally is well macam
break lah one and a half month tak kerja ni sampai sekarang dah one week pun nak kerja malas body aching betul sia body aching
tengah hari balik kan tidur aku punya kaki sampai from top to bottom
ache semua sakit kaki
no lah I walk I walk in the room lah five five ten five to ten minutes one end to one end walk that's my exercise first week play game makan sikit ah second week habis

pagi bangun lagi the last two weeks last one week the cycle is like that
my toklang tu I got one page lah it's uh batam concierge
when the border reopens err ada plan ah this transportation

dia hari-hari before this COVID kat rumah jer main dengan anak pakai seluar pendek lepak you know
then I was talking to him but the last one month tu
ah every night kita berbual then he did he he inspire he is very inspiring lah
so he made so he told me you know abang abang pernah nampak saya kerja tak memang tak pernah saya hari-hari kat rumah lepak

uh and and and he you know he looking at him starting from nothing tiba-tiba ada kereta ada ada bus uh uh is all made is all from from from from travel lah

oh masuk
when you tengok eh it's a it's a niche lah a'ah exactly exactly
someone dah tahu kan
exactly people get the idea right orang akan ikut because I believe also there's a lot of macam err local singaporean guy who got married to

nampak kat ayer rajah boon keng oh dia punya tu kan
all the stick tu kan lebat you know like tebal you know
petang alamak ni kalau malam ni at night jalan ni oh
eh betul lah kat situ yang kat boon keng ah
sini ah sini ah kat colonial mm mm
macam main bawah blok sia tu bro
eh anyway sekarang david moyes kat mana siol
oh dia sekarang manage west ham oh west ham eh ah how did west ham do in their oh they lost against new castle
and you know we we've got these we've got these dia macam kau macam you just look at this guy
and you're like okay dah settle settle settle you know you know you know he's got the swagger you know he's a bawler you know like damn this guy goes in and that's it man the game is over
so that's why mourinho selalunya dia nya team err their possession their possession stats are usually quite low right okay
klopp and mourinho ni macam dorang macam opposite sides of the spectrum ah in a way ah
apa swan eh swan swan and harry kane
sun sun ke swan
okay ya lah I mean it's like it's like championship manager ah right oh no no best is the best is like FIFA what am I saying okay okay sorry sorry aku dah lupa defence ni apa
how do you how do you play it on Android on your phone aku
okay lah takpe lah anyway ah I don't want to get myself involved in another addictive thing ah cause you know I've just uh
I've I've recently gotten addicted to a few things on Netflix already and on Apple so pada aku macam
I I like what Netflix does these days eh dorang ada macam ranking for the programme stuff so like if you are watching from singapore they will tell you like what are the good shows it's not what are the good shows that are singaporean me in like a moulmein high for instance
sial lah bro that one macam for life for life for life I will be like when I watch moulmein high right I will be like
kau zuleika zulkifli actually likes this bloody show this poor excuse on my television program
tell all documentary ah an anelka and his life you know like you know how he converted to islam you know and then what he's currently doing you know the the clubs that he has played at everything macam basically
aku rasa nama dia macam gitu ah I mean he's muslim name is supposedly bilal but okay anyway I mean it doesn't focus too much on the religion on his religion but more on like the funny
like one was the the france punya
and macam pada anelka it was not fair ah like for him to be made ya for him to be singled out so okay so anyway
okay so so so basically macam I've watched cobra kai I've watched err I mean I don't tend to watch the series ah I would watch like documentaries or macam movies ah so like social dilemma was another thing I watched recently which was pretty interesting ah
err social dilemma is basically this documentary that I mean everybody's talking about this documentary now uh it's about how macam Facebook Instagram all these all these you know the social media giants kan dorang basically
dorang tahu like what attracts you what what you're interested in uh
so dorang buat macam uh and if not an avatar they like what do you call it lah
to all these third party you know it's it's not that it's more like macam they they use your data to know what hooks you and that's why macam Facebook becomes like you know it becomes personalise it becomes something that you are addicted to
sia ah why do they think this way sia asal dorang fikir macam gitu like dia
kau how can people just support sia macam tak masuk akal but actually the problem is the people who are supporting they are being fed information that fits their worldview you see okay so so it's a very like ya lah usually it's either very insidious thingy ah
so he seen all like atrocities of war so he's kind of like macam lost his faith a bit lah cause one of the themes of the movie
after he has a son of his own he starts to macam go back to
like worshipping god ah no macam macam it's like it's like suddenly he
feels drawn you know it's like macam ya lah orang beragama pun macam
kau ada kau punya turun naik gitu that sort of thing so macam mungkin dia tak sembahyang for like five years lepas tu dia macam eh astgahfirullah aku kena qadak balik solat aku
ya so so so that's a tragedy macam something happens and then after that he he has this macam love hate relationship with god and then his son who's growing up is looking at this you know and observing it and then the son also grows up
to have that kind of like macam ah
you know that twilight fella lah huh ya the glittery vampire so dia yang sekarang
okay shouldn't stereotype err pastor dorang
okay lah so it's an lah it's not the Android box yang Android box yang sikit hari aku pergi rumah kau kau ada kan tu benda kan
no he was in house of cards and and err house of cards the final season just macam tergantung macam gitu apa
ya so so so basically I think this is what's happening mungkin sekarang dunia sekarang cause of all the
religious upbringing to say like eh ni benda salah sia what am I doing you know that sort of thing so macam I mean that's probably why you see all these peeping toms in
no lah no no no no no I mean there that if there was it would have been a big thing and it would have been like macam it won't have been like once every few months ah which is the situation you find it you find now ah
dia panggil kau sir but asal dia masuk lagi siang dari kau seh
check it out I I was wrong okay lah I mean I think I can tell this to the camera eh to the camera pula to the recorder okay I was from serangoon right
ya I mean when he when it came out in the news the first thing we did was to share in the WhatsApp group and then we were like asking like ini aizat adam ni semua like eh ya eh eh you guys remember this guy ya ya ya he's from our school dulu
I don't think you will he's a he's just a random chinese dude lah but but macam
and he was in a class where he was in a class where cause there were there were not that many uh malays in so like there were some classes which were purely chinese lah macam you won't find a malay chap in the in that class ah
I'm I'm sure I'm sure the article is still somewhere on the straits times nanti aku google aku check kan lepas tu aku aku aku forward dekat kau lah
so you know you can you can you can know about the monsters that uh inhibits our society ah but basically ya lah back to what we were saying macam aku rasa that's where you know we are I mean just looking at our generation and comparing it to our parents generation you cannot really see
there's a lot of difference apa betul tak like
ya macam one thing about us mungkin err compared to kita punya parents eh macam kita kahwin lagi lambat abeh kita tend to macam mungkin ada lebih mata air dari mak bapa kita you know like our parents aku rasa dorangnya generations is like kau kenal ni satu perempuan
within a few months tunang another few months kahwin you know that sort of thing
what was that so so so you see eh macam what ondre said is like that was our parents I mean our grandparents is completely different ah you know like my mum my grandmother like thirteen fourteen years old she was like married off to the husband without even knowing who her husband was
but ya I mean that was that was the case ah macam like oh it was a norm ah like oh your father will just marry you off you know when the time is right ya exactly so so like
like if you are a man of twenty one twenty two back there then you are okay kau dah kerja kau dah ada hasil sikit or maybe you're an immigrant like my grandmother they got married to both my grandmothers got married to pakistani migrants ah you know so macam like
orang pakistan kat sini will be like
okay you you you you you know you you you form part of our group now ah so maybe kat masjid ke jumpa dekat kedai kopi ke apa then talk talk talk eh I got a daughter you know
that sort of thing ah macam it was it was that sort of environment where the girl doesn't even have a say as to who she's married to ah but of course I mean
I think I think for you also that time you mentioned that macam err syed ahmad was interested in your mother
um okay so what was that okay so basically macam ya that's if you see that from one generation to the next definitely that relationship between men and women is changing ah so macam kadang-kadang aku pun ada fikir sia eh anak aku
I think girls these days they are like lagi beza dari kita macam in the sense that they are really pressured to
susceptible to this ah macam kita semua pun ada macam ikut-ikut orang apa in a way lah but aku rasa untuk wanita ni
dorang lebih senang dipengaruh ah pada aku ah ah like compared to guys ah macam I mean like you mean like when I got married also I realised my wife macam
ah kau nak kahwin dekat masjid kau tak ada nak ada walimah you know that sort of thinking you know
where they provide a place for you to do the walimah kan
a still somewhat rare for the whole majlis from front to end to be held in the mosque but of course nowadays you have places like masjid mawaddah
no but bartley is like macam bartley is is is so called not really
I'm trying to say is that macam nowadays you have instances where people do say like eh should we have our majlis in a mosque cause then like orang nak sembahyang and all that it's easy for them that sort of thing and then ya it's like macam it's a it's a nice place to you for you to have your wedding what you know in a way lah but of course
pada aku pun aku rasa macam if I could have done it again maybe I would have done a walimah a small walimah outside the mosque ah
okay ah not not exactly where I wanted the conversation to go but then you okay so so macam macam pada aku macam bini aku macam that was
something that that was on her mind like macam eh why are we doing it in the mosque abeh macam like oh I want to invite only these few people and of course now because of COVID you are forced
to have a small wedding like you can't have a big wedding but but I mean but pada aku macam like and same like when I wanted to buy my house which was a three room flat people were like
eh why you buying a three room flat sia it's so macam aku rasa macam I think I've I've put my wife under a lot of pressure ah I've I've I've subjected to a lot of like questioning ah
you know landed correct correct but I think in a way macam at the end of the day you just have to be
ya huh ya ya aku dah end of this month eh end of this month eh end of this year dah enam tahun
aku fikir aku nak upgrade to macam five room ke ah
sengkang juga
bro bro tampines mahal bro tampines mahal gila no no no I'm I'm going to stay near my parents
so tak ah tu abbas nya parents aku sengkang apa
basically basically okay basically basically sengkang right it's divided into a rivervale compassvale anchorvale and fernvale lah so for those people who don't know sengkang you know is divided into this so called macam four districts gitu lah so err anchorvale and fernvale is separated by this sungai lah
it's called the sungai punggol I think ah so like if you look out my window here you can see the sungai ah
so that sungai punggol err is the boundary between sengkang which is held by the workers' party and ang mo kio which is held by pinky work
you should talk to my cousin abbas ah who lives down the street cause he was the one who told me eh kalau kau suka breaking bad kau kena watch this better call saul lah
so aku macam aku ada tengok ah like like a
I think I watch like season one season two I mean there were parts where it was already addictive but after a while aku macam how many seasons are there oh my god breaking bad only has five seasons
no I I I think I think I watched up to that point where abang dia yang very afraid of electricity or some shit like that right
okay I I think roughly around at that point aku dah macam
kan there was one point where the brother suddenly like he he he I for some reason it was like a miracle dia macam terus didn't have that
a psychological thingy so he just ended up like going into the office and I think he didn't want the ya lah but he kept on macam like downplaying si jimmy nya achievement ah dia macam cakap you'll never amount to anything that sort of thing kan
and the witcher ke apa witcher witcher pun aku tak tengok sangat
eh prison break si dia tu dah mati kan the actual dah mati kan the guy who plays michael scofield lah
okay let me google this michael scofield mati
so is season five good or not dorang ada tulis prison break season six lagi tak ah
the movie was not on the ni ni kan the movie was on siapa eh only the final break
shucks ah ikram stop getting me hooked back on all this crap lah malas sial nak pergi tengok ni semua
oh my god stop sia kau
aku bilang kau aku aku tak boleh aku tak boleh once I see macam satu benda ni ada four five seasons kan
aku terus lemah ah aku macam no lah I cannot watch this sia
the the code will come out I just scan and cause I'm using the singpass punya app
mine is after iPhone eight lah basically boleh ah so so so it's one of those things that I don't know ah Apple fan boys are talking about these days ah
double double tap then the code keluar
the scanner the scanner the scanner keluar not the code the camera thingy ya
double tap then the no you don't need to press anything double tap and then your that that square will come out and you just aim it at the code ah macam ni kau tengok ayatul kursi
no no no that's that's if you can lah kat bawah tu kan
then it goes ayatul kursi
there kat bawah kat bawah sini
can you see or not it's like when you follow you follow this dia macam go
so uh inshallah with ah I also reciting ayatul kursi we will get our twenty dollars and err we can spend it on a steak later at jalan kayu
shall we talk about our favourite makan places since it's almost lunch
tempat makan aku tahu ada tempat makan sana ah
tapi I've never heard of it being described as a good place lah
babe aku pun aku pun I know I know err anchorvale
dorang ada the vending machine cafe ah if that's what you are referring to
the yassin kampung kau pernah dengar yassin kampung
yes so yassin kampung they have this off shoot called lepak one corner
the worst name you can have for this particular place cause it's the place where you cannot lepak one corner it it doesn't feel like the lepak place ah it feels like you just go in kau beli makan dekat no the thing is what know you can't even sit down to get the waiter to come and serve you you have to
okay ya good joke but ah so then macam apa tau dia macam tempat makan dia eh dia macam okay kau kena masuk abeh kau kena macam queue up dekat the stall ah so it's like a hawker stall ah it's like a hawker centre
hawker centre you don't sit down and the fella comes to you right you got to go to the stall and order like abeh kau kena pergi sana order then after that you got to get ready your cash cause you got to put it into that stupid machine obviously these days nobody wants to touch cash so you put it into the machine they will dispense your change
then after that makanan dia okay lah not bad lah but pada aku macam so so juga but it doesn't have the lepak feeling lah
because like pada aku lepak feeling macam kau kau duduk then like eh bhai teh tarik lagi satu ah eh if you want to go place you should go to mahamoodiya
yes the one next to the Shell eh dorang dah up market sia
then aku realise
mahal sia it's like seven hundred dollars for the one that we are going ya is because it's the apa last week of the year what
kan then aku tak tahu macam mana like we need to have more options I guess
but unless we go for the apa ah smaller rooms ah
that one untuk yang the suite room so aku rasa macam besar sangat I mean we don't really need a that big of a room right no but I think can go for the smaller rooms
aku rasa boleh ah but I think it's about dalam empat ratus gitu
aku rasa ah
ya I think aku rasa for now empat orang but
the price confirm makin mahal
botanic gardens theme ah the boy bunga theme
oh ya dia belum decide right
prime is hard to find you know there's only like berapa jer dalam singapore ni tau nak cari
kipas oh it's at terrence's house now his house got two fans you know sebelah-sebelah leh like one black one white I don't know why if you want both right the whole dining table that can fly away like that it's so strong
ya bodoh so big sia
ya so what is just the four of us ah xing jing oh no with the others right because we doing dinner dengan yang lain-lain kan malam so
kau plan lah then kau bilang kita then we will just decide I mean we will just a vote
ya they bodoh
this is christmas so tak payah lohei
I think dinenr can go all out lah I guess not all out as in macam terus
apa sakan ah but more like a
no there is there is buffet but you cannot like it's not serve lah I mean like it's not open and you have to order from them so it's like a la carte kind so you keep on ordering from them then the makanan will dia ada server will send to you yes I know right ya so I think it's not a good time for buffet
he kena bullied
what what do you mean location kena change you mean the buffet town run away or what
for the dinner dia orang boleh eh
um terrence I haven't check with him yet tapi aku rasa maybe dia tak boleh because that week he's going back to school already
there's only fifty percent right now like people using it and the token collected and they need to be at least macam tujuh puluh percent untuk
dia orang go to phase three lah so
more than five even though your request for separate tables only unless you are a family members lah yang tinggal dalam serumah right
okay also like like terrence friend have a christmas punya dinner kan
so aku tak tahu ah macam mana like
bo pian lah kan macam tak boleh apa
I mean technically it's not even a macam public holiday on that day right
I think he never go there before so you should be safe dia tak ada benchmark untuk tempat tu
then the next morning he will aku rasa go to the work straight
so the tuesday morning aku rasa he has to go back to work lor
cause I remember I ask my friend for monday tuesday punya time slot I mean err rates ya
masih ah kau taiwan
ya it was that one I go on march it was macam sejuk ah tapi macam just like aircon kind yes
the he say macam apa like
he's not going they are not going to macam vaccinate everybody kat singapore
tak tahu save duit agaknya
apa purpose kan I mean at home technically don't wear mask also
so kalau anak dia dapat mak dia dapat they can just spread to each other lah
oh cactus cactus yang kecil-kecil gitu eh then
dua cactus
no the normal cactus yang besar dia ada thorns then macam bulat-bulat gitu and dia punya shape
straight then bulat-bulat eh right ya isn't it a normal desert cactus
kau siak ah hey mahal pokok tu
kau tanam pokok durian jer lah
the experts say lah the lockdown causes more macam apa problems than benefits ya
macam dulu dia tak pakai grab but sekali now oh I need to have a grab account like you know so it
it pushes them to do it lah rather than kau tahu macam kalau tak ada COVID like everybody is still
macam oodle the oodle eats like that ya it came out about during also got famous because of this so
okay lah aku rasa
ya but but they are given trainings you know and they were even even like given grants and money untuk
aku rasa okay lah
bagus lah kan macam macam semua orang jual apa jual apa what's that famous thing they make during lockdown
everybody become a chef kat rumah kan semua buat dalgona coffee macam kau
you will just stuck at home with your family lah you got no choice but just to interact dengan dia orang like
but although yes I agree that it can be quite a challenge because like kalau kau baca that time the news they say like domestic abuse cases on is on the rise was on the rise because
then aku rasa like I think they dia orang tak concentrate more much on the emotional part of a lockdown like they just implement without thinking of
I mean during the even like dia punya apa
so they don't really care about that part aku tak tahu but
it just go without the track what sia bodoh
iya lah confirm ada lah
they're gonna released back into the wild it's gonna cause like a major disrupt to the ecosystem then macam suddenly kau dalam hutan tu kau introduce monyet kau introduce pangolin kau introduce lemur pelanduk I don't know what or it released dolphin into the forest you know
ya ni bukan library tau kau taruh lepas tu kau taruh balik kat tempat asal kau ambil tau
so they have to kill or macam that one lah like what chicken flu like that eh bird flu chicken flu
sekali coronavirus from plants leh
kau masih tau
I only need to buy one plant untuk taruh dalam office aku
but actually mati a very terrible death to do
ya sia kau teruk sia
then we got scraping benda tu
aiya the typical kau tahu jemputan selalu dapat pokok tu dia orang taruh kat pasu
dia macam coconut tree but it's not
what is it called eh yang
it's not coconut tree yang pokok-pokok yang
fern gitu is it look like a fern
tak lah serious
ya usually events that kind of pokok lah you know like those
standard pokok I don't know
it's the typical pokok at events you know
yes that's one thing pokok pisang
the youngest means macam early twenties twenty two ah wow I feel old now
bila ah staycation
this one you planning to do for kak ain's birthday right
makan kat mana for dinner
central area lagi kalau nak makan
boleh masak Maggi
I think you all can go jalan-jalan dekat gardens by the bay before that
usually like who want to bangun pagi I cannot bangun pagi man
eh kalau staycation
have you been to the yang itu the art museum
because they have that interacting punya
I forgot the time she I think the one that mama went with kak ain dekat
japan kat tokyo they went to the japan one
then mama cakap ada
like this one this macam interacting nya board gitu so you can draw your own animals
oh then she excited macam budak kecil
since dah macam central central
and then your parents boleh
feeling sikit
because I think dekat Carousell you can find like cheaper tickets
actually tengok-tengok date lah but then if you book december right you can use your voucher mah
is do you think aryan is old enough to masuk
mm then can boleh pakai seh
but you went to Malayan Council before right to makan
makan dekat sana ada that Noosh Noodle Bar
ah if you go the if you go the the art museum kan dah dekat like you walk through the helix bridge lepas tu dah belok
then dah sampai esplanade what esplanade kan][dah dekat
and nak kalau nak mengopi ada coffee bean
and then boleh jalan-jalan can take photos
yang dekat omotesando
like you know the japanese they very macam
generous with their portions so the bun they toast it dia dah toast panas-panas
then lepas tu the amount of lobster that they stuffed inside that
ya I feel like semua orang cakap it's um expensive lagi mahal but then I feel like if you record eh uh record pula if you um
convert it back right the price is actually the same as the one dekat japan because dekat japan they have the regular size and size
dekat sini they only have size
having it in your own currency that's why I think like people nya mindset macam
ni lagi mahal seh
ah berbual for what
kat japan boleh makan pe but now you're not going japan right so
because I see dekat macam online blog gitu I feel like it's
okay lah dia macam tak lokek
ya ya ya ya ya I thought you were the one yang tanya what is yakiniku
dekat the place itself
so they give you raw beef dia macam Seoul Garden Seoul Garden tapi it's just beef
I had the one dekat japan also it was so good the halal one
so we went and then we went for um during lunch time dia macam tak crowded even though there's so many people at the
and then they had dish macam dish eh
they had this macam
um raw beef set like the bento tapi with raw beef
then the griller dekat depan
so you get to grill your own tapi it's like a bento
dish is like lauk right
like I don't mind eating the Luke's Lobster everyday for my rest of my life the roti
but it's a dish mah so I thought it's um macam should be included
okay I think I will choose um clam vongole mama punya clam vongole
with lots of cili padi and um
confirm rumah dia besar eh
like have you seen um will smith punya rumah
it's like tingkat bertingkat and then kat belakang ada swimming pool
uh apa tu
will smith punya rumah punya gambar
dorang jalan jauh-jauh pun they will stay around their house
ada macam living room a'ah
dia just kekal
you can be tak handsome but then have a good uh fit body tapi I'm like
once you have a fit body kalau muka tak handsome then I'm like
like you see some model pun macam
eh badan dia buff seh sekali dia pusing ah kau
genre drama atau rancangan yang paling anda gemari
my favourite channel is the crime investigation channel dekat rumah
tapi sekarang dah tak ada seh
uh like for example conjuring dengan annabelle
because dia macam okay they want to act
make it macam as if oh betul betul happening betul betul like
abeh macam if you macam fikir balik like
who has the camera on their hand like twenty four seven gitu
I mean it's a good macam
maybe dulu is a good macam good thing for a change lah
don't know I like the way she tells the story macam very interesting like she doesn't macam she talks a lot but it is like she doesn't macam
macam tak boring gitu
you know some people nanti dorang macam berbual berbual
and then halfway it gets boring because macam too draggy
tapi and then this
ya I I finished all the ones dekat Facebook
dekat YouTube is still ongoing
there's this one movie dekat Netflix
I didn't know the story was out on Netflix macam a few years ago I thought dia baru keluar
because dulu when
dia keluar bila two thousand eight kan eh two thousand eighteen
the movie keluar
why recently Netflix macam dorang released so many macam documentaries
tomorrow kerja petang seh I think malam that malam after since tutup I think I can watch
macam dah lama nak lah like you wish
so dari kecil sampai sekarang you like
rumah besar as in like
so like balas jasa gitu
tapi dulu when SARS happened
I'm in I think primary school kot lupa
ya then dia tak serabak now lah like
tapi COVID is like
from one country then lepas tu another country then lepas tu tiba-tiba like the whole world sampai
airports semua tutup sia like
like tiba tiba orang tengah kerja macam
these people like some people in the world like let's say the they not taking this macam seriously
tu ah
I mean tapi sekarang re-election so I feel like
tapi macam tu lah I mean korang nak the COVID to finish
to end to finally like macam
no more new cases tu semua everybody to heal
until tak nak dengar like to wear mask wash your hands
tapi orang tak nak dengar then like
esok kerja eh
esok kerja petang seh
you know my tempat kerja ada budak baru
it's a malay guy then he budak T
he's on internship and because I thought when he masuk
usually kalau
oh I didn't really actually get to ask him but it was so macam terkejut like oh you from polytechnic I'm like oh ya
I mean like okay then you would be more familiarised with the macam
like you know the courses tu semua how the works tapi macam
macam sensitive issue lah because they usually macam
deal with macam money money um orang bayarkan
dorang bayar duit tu join courses tu semua so maybe they like
they don't let us have an account to do that kind of things just in case we make any mistakes ke apa ke
so they will only let the senior yang kerja lama kat sana tu
so kita orang usually ada
kita duduk counter jer kat
ya lah dekat office ah
so dah passion card layan tu ni but then
to um apa tu apply for you know the
under macam not everything can buat right
a'ah especially kalau macam the
issue is about government punya duit like government bagi duit because of this COVID right so they'll think like
they already like refer them to us then after that kita orang macam then they come to the then after that we tell them that
then you know macam tak happy lah
ya then after that the other day got this one makcik lah she was disappointed because we couldn't help her with the application
we cannot even like use other people punya computer
your issue lah tapi macam for us is sensitive because
sekali kalau apa-apa ya
sekali your information is all leaked or what then I'm like okay that's why
jap tengok dia punya battery
ya so I said go to but then dorang cakap ah very far I cannot walk and all
oh but I'm doing this for my mother and then she cannot walk or what then a bit leceh so far
adik stop
dia cakap she applied
uh apa tu she passed away
that means the person punya mum
but then they keep like arguing macam
especially if it's like racial issue macam
because I'm malay right and then after that if there's a makcik who came
if there's a makcik who come by
tolong sikit pun tak boleh kita kan melayu
so it's like that my kerja is like that
uh as a housing officer dekat dormitory punya office
mm I'll be in the office lor so basically kalau that office is for the foreign workers kalau let's say they have
pay them on time ke apa like this kind of problem they will come to the office and tu
I told them I was like ya but then maybe you'll be doing macam roundings ke apa ke so you like
dia kata macam you know macam Expo event but every day
eh medical interview pula the medical check-up
dorang berbual english
orh okay tu tempat landed landed nya tempat oh okay okay
then kalau macam
so that means the classes macam
like let's say if the that means one teacher ada fifteen right then means half of that
macam like around tujuh ke lapan orang then halfway dorang uh balik tidur
they also belajar
usually macam after dorang punya macam so called
before that makan ke lepas tu makan
oh dorang makan dulu eh orh so macam
then makan
jaga budak ya I think it's
dia macam malu eh
you got listen to misteri jam dua belas or not
huh tak ah aku tak berani I mean aku takut kena kacau sekali tu aku dah takut ya eh I think I told you right that time then ya I was studying at home I think I was twelve ah I was studying at home right then the the
eh you let's listen together no no I add sound effects what the hell I mean you know my place my areas sana banyak keras kan shit lah
dulu eh kau tinggal situ

I I only went to the old fuchun for apa tu for uh orientation I was like my first year in my primary school because but my first my first uh my first year in primary school was at the new one it's just that when I orientation it was at the old one
I don't know but I remember I think I think your parents apply for primary school then they give you like macam mana I think you bid when I think it's bidding right is it by bidding or something no I think for uh apa tu pun sama kan uh the kindergarten I think because my sister she did the same thing I think she bid for placement
so it's not enough place they'll put you another place ya they said fuchun was uh one of the best primary schools there a lot produces a lot of uh apa they say a lot of high scorpions and which is true ah
old uh old fuchun was haunted new fuchun was okay lah I mean it was not as keras
like apa evergreen they didn't have like brownies it was red cross or then there was then I was like mm okay lah red cross sounds like similar sekali I join aku join
I mean it wasn't hard I mean I join I enjoyed it it was just different because brownies was like uh buy my cookies you know like uh uh was an elf or like a pixie you know then you will learn how to cook learn how to sew but brownie was like was really like you know footdrills ya they really make sure you do so like you're you know you like ya because you had to do evacuation and things like that first aid my specialty was red cross knowledge history basically like the history we learn we had to learn about apa tu the founder lah things like that apa tu
I only had apa eh
kesian got try got try
masak we we learnt how to not really it's like nutrition is a bit like like like nutrition ah like our current nutrition class it's just that was more they they need more hands on cooking
had to cook ya I had to put during fasting month batal sia legit terbatal puasa aku I was like unconsciously I was like hmm rasa masin tak shit ya I was like ya oh my god oh no then I was like am I supposed to spit it out my friends was like ah batal jer lah then I was like alahai shit lah tak sengaja then ya you can okay lah I mean I felt guilty for like I was like okay lah batal batal lah it's fine I ganti anyways
err like basically musical theory then they taught us to play recorder pianica entah
I was in charge of the gong but it's like apa tu
but I was late once and they had to switch me over or something then I change it's like ya the drum is like I forgot what's the name of the instrument but it's like one side is smaller one side is bigger then ya I wanted to use the kompang kompang you know or the or the small one no not rebana it's the it's the long one then it's like it's the you know you know apa tu
err pontianak harum sundal malam you know the long one the metal with the round thing at the top ya then ya I wanted to play that that's a part of gamelan gamelan is the name of the whole thing what orchestra bukan xylophone panjang-panjang wait ya it's something like xylophone lah ah bulat-bulat
ya lah I had to uh I had to masuk gamelan play guitar piano had to learn piano apa tu ha they made us dance they made us fusion dance then uh contempt I was like oh my god do I look like I can dance hmm
I'm more of a musician ha me is not uh apa tu dancer you know saya bukan penari ya I was like okay ah apa tu then for sports we had to learn floorball in primary school floorball
then apa tu
played a lot lah we played a lot I was good at sports but when you know you had to run around like run around the field you know to warm up I'm like orh tak nak tak nak tak nak then it's like
qiam jer
ya it was rumah orang kan
buat bodoh jer
primary five then secondary school sec two you know always they had the night walks right it was at the you know those really old camps did you watch okay you watched incredible tales right you saw yang you know about the the the the
kena like kena jalan lah macam dia orang tarukkan glow stick kan lepas tu
dia orang apa tu dia orang bagi kau jalan dengan the first person kena pegang dia punya torchlight then yang belakang tu you know then macam kena taruk tangan atas bahu
caterpillar gitu ha I was usually either the first or the last one because I wasn't scared you know I'm not scared lah so but the weirdest thing you at what for some reason once kan what happened was aku tengah like everything was okay like it it started out fine
when we went to the camps when we tried to come back to the campsite lah so basically after the uh night the first mission night walk right then they had a briefing then tepuk ah something like that we walked back to the campsite that I somehow tripped tripped but I didn't really trip because it was
but the what weird like apa tu
benda yang pelik yang terjadi kan actually selepas tu
like so basically kan like okay so I was injured so I I fell so I I sprained my ankle kan so yang dia punya faci dia kan the eh no a teacher wanted to take a shorter cut lah because I was injured right so they uh they brought three of us took the shorter cut by the time we sampai dia punya campsite kan
I don't know they they they were getting ready to eat apa tu supper eh ya then they showered already then one of my friends like err apa tu where where did you go lah right why you said I thought you take shortcut oh why you take so long ah I'm uh then aku macam
aku tak tahu sia
I don't know I don't know it didn't feel very long it felt like it was short but the problem is when we reach everyone was either showered or the last few are showering you know that kan so you can you think do you like people shower you you get the girls and all lama juga lah kan ha lama juga so I was oh my god until now I can't figure out what happened but ya
it's near a madrasah also right
why would you put your kubur there tanah ah
kampung sia what I'm weird is one thing that is that in the hustle and bustle of the city
macam kampung pula kan
no I think they know because I went to search up on you know where to visit you know we we always do those visits right and I was searching where to visit ah then I saw this one place they said kubur melayu tengah-tengahnya apa tu kat bugis juga I think
like beside that's why when the moment you said oh kat bugis right then I was like is it near the near the madrasah and when you said yes I know about this story it's quite famous lah I mean who would think
kan I mean the only time I experienced that was that time kampung lah
aku nak pergi surau because I used to I used to stay over at my pakcik's house right and
my pakcik and makcik orang malaysia right orang malaysia kau tau lah rumah dia orang kat kampung-kampung kan so one one of the kampung is kalau nak daripada surau dah habis solat nak kena jalan balik tu kena lalu kubur
okay lah okay it was fine it was fine it was because you know you pergi surau you won't go alone what especially because I budak singapore kan mana orang nak bagi anak pergi sana especially because malaysia you know ah there's a lot of those cases right so
banyak ah bukan culik jer habis
so it's like I mean seram is seram but yang paling seram is one of my uncle's house dekat ni jalan tan kee it's kat eh but I think they move ah already it was damn dilapidated
it's like the area was macam it was how to say ah they want to
pecahkan they want to pecahkan and nak buat rumah baru but it's like dia orang tak nak move because they were miskin kan so it's like apa tu
like as a kid I was like entah I don't know but it smelt really bad so as a kid you know biasa lah you know very particular right so tak nak tak nak masuk tunggu dalam van but we me and my cousin got stuck in the van the lock rosak ya they had to send it to a kedai to get it fixed but anyways lah so basically it's like you know it's the really old kampung type like you want shower right must go out ya it's under the pokok then my mum was like when I was showering with my mum my mum was like jangan tengok atas
pokok kekabu weh
no it's open air it's zinc oak lah it's just a zinc panels sebelah kiri kanan habis you know it's the dia punya tempat air dia orang simpan air kat tempayan you know those
ya it's like you know those kimchi kimchi jars yes they put water in it dah rupa baldi tau habis dah lah air sejuk
aku nangis sumpah aku tak berani aku tak berani pergi toilet sorang-sorang tau aku kalau pergi toilet masa kat kampung ibu ibu pergi ibu pergi lah sorang ibu no I'm not going to go alone toilet dah lah kat luar tengah-tengah malam masa tu nak shower sorang-sorang you know you imagine my family from singapore all the way to all the way to malaysia kan then you take bath all the way then melekit kalau tak tak nak solat lagi
ya but I mean I shower because it was with my mum but imagine if I was I was alone I will not shower I don't know how my sister went to shower alone oh my god dah lah masa tu tengah ada case apa tu you know they masa that one is early two thousand still got case of apa tu orang minyak ke apa kan something like that
pengamal pengamal they they they practise like magic no they amal it like
you you know how some you know how some people buang dia orang punya pad darah dia orang kan dia orang nak lawa kan dia orang nanti ambil dia orang baca-baca dia orang ambil dia orang punya darah uzur tu dia orang taruk kat muka dia orang baca-baca that's how lah dia orang amal lah macam orang ya because like you know how they simpan jin simpannya hantu raya simpannya simpannya cik kak kan apa
balik kampung no
no I don't know I don't know eh I think I don't know eh is it I also don't know but I I still don't know the difference I only recently found out all the difference between langsuir and pontianak
oh yang nenek tu eh
bomoh eh
is it the makcik bomoh that one that episode
ya the one that the guy potong kuku malam-malam then the guy the other guy bukanya payung dalam rumah kan ya ya why what's your question
apa apa no penanggal penanggal lain do you realise it's the same thing because nananggal is the philippines term for penanggal penanggal is melayu
you will realise that okay you realise that a lot of the folklore right it's similar because we live in the same region you know if you check our genealogy kan philippines indonesia melayu orang orang singapore yes correct we are all basically the same ethnicities just that because of the you know the like they they split up and things like that aiya anyways but ya it's actually the same folklore lah
that's why you said lady in white right for us it's pontianak you were saying
oh one of the one of the oh it wasn't in the it wasn't in the oh ya ya ya ya ya the penanggal yang takde so basically the apa tu the organs that one right ya it's not a joke my dad used to oh ya you know I I did the interview right so basically uh for our interview for the coding in school right for class so my dad actually used to work for telcom
you know zaman dulu is yang apa tu tali dia hanging kan kat atas it wasn't underground like now kan ya so basically singapore ha kat kat malaysia tak lah kat singapore lah so basically like apa tu they had to change dia punya lines kadang-kadang kalau kadang-kadang dia uh telephone lama dia orang kan rosak then he was one of the people who go and repair
ya it was ah it's technician ah electric punya technician so basically what happened was that you know if you tukar senja-senja you'll see sometimes the penanggal head will get stuck at the at the hanging lines
no how to say eh penanggal is not really macam it's not like hantu raya it's not like pontianak it's not dead oh it's practice they say eh they pengamal they like orang minyak kan amal black magic so it's like apa tu
ha they practise ah but I don't remember what was the reason I know I know err orang minyak is to be good looking or something
I don't remember I think he was ugly or something then he say that he wants to like he was sick of people making fun of him or something aku tak ingat right no no no he made a made a perjanjian dengan syaitan then to like to make himself look handsome LOL then that's called something called plastic surgery sia plastic surgery
but like I kind of understand because when you work with not bomoh lah but you work with syaitan right it's natural I guess I mean the fact that you don't have
entah lah suka hati kau lah nak
oh dia nak makan anak dia I think
oh awet muda
you know the story about the there are like people I remember one of the incredible tales and actually it happened if you I don't know if you notice but when people get uh malay people pregnant right they will put things under their what was it pillow put things at their tingkap
I guess it's kind of make sense but I mean if it was a follow ah they say that err they put because they are this one jin or ghost kan hantu kan that will actually steal the baby ya it's the same jin that you were telling me that day we were talking about that day I think
scared the heck out of me they eat the ya the rahim they they eat the janin right they that's why they say what zaman dulu maghrib jer tutup tingkap then they then they will hang like paku-paku atau punya apa tu
garam kind of I don't know this I don't know for some reason garam is apparently quite useful in like islamic practices right they use it as border ya I don't know is that I don't know is that how my dad pagar rumah or not but ya
ya they say what is it ah what what daun apa also not ketumbar but they say LOL ketumbar untuk makan there's one daun they use to like apa tu
I don't know what's the name of the daun but it's like
ya I I they say that it cleanses something no I don't remember but if I remember I'll tell you but it's like ya they say it clean like apa tu uh
anasir-anasir sihir or something like that
they said they use it for kalau orang kena rasuk ke kena rasuk kena apa tu kena hantar apa tu sihir ke they use the daun or something I don't remember this one daun they even sell sabun or like sabun because who want to buy daun and go and clean yourself
use it's the same idea as tanah liat you know so you touch pig or dog you can just wipe what ya technology ya
but ya actually a lot of the jins are quite chicken sia I heard a lot of people right need to be careful like you know people give birth right you don't know who the one who sambut the baby
I mean like I said lah the the the jin we were talking about this it eats uh it steals babies and things like that that's why they say what actually the the reason behind oh need to go back inside the house uh uh sebelum maghrib right
but ya you can you imagine the doctor when got nurse then sekali got extra nurse the one that sambut your baby oh no oh my god hell no because my mum says that it's very keras lah that's why I was so scared when I was hospitalised early this year I was like but then again new places also got things what everywhere got things what even talking about them right now confirm they'll be like oh they talking about me
ugh two bad you don't you don't go to camp sia but that time when I was like red cross in brownies I always had camps right sometimes like when you too tired I don't know whether it's a hallucination or not but I'm pretty sure I'm not because what I'm the kind right once I sleep I like if world war three happens also I wouldn't wake up I will sleep even when a bomb drops ya tidur mati ah ya then like so basically what happened was that I was awake I woke up I was groggy but I was awake I mean I'm blind lah I wear specs lah but I was awake but I saw like something at the end of my bed like standing
I was looking at it okay baca apa kau aku baca pun kena kacau that's why
baca ke tak baca it won't stop me from getting disturbed
is it but then again when you hear about like I see like all the syarahan-syarahan they say actually jin can apa tu manipulate your dreams things like that even when they actually disturb you they can't touch you they can only manipulate your mind right
I think rather than hasutan right if they can insert images in your brain when you're sleep right they can do the same when you are awake what ya so basically it's not exactly hasutan but it's more of because hasutan are words right they play with your mind ya definitely even when you see err like english like like american horror movies or things like that if you realise that most of it is just ya they play with your mind
like because sometimes I don't know some people they say what apa eh iman kuat or semangat kuat or something right then they said that apa tu
oh so since like this person semangat kuat akan disturb so I'm like ya like how my my sister lemah semangat kan so dia kena kacau instead of my father
because my kakak penakut I think no wonder anak dia pun ikut lah pergi toilet pun bushu can you open the light for me mother never open the door please lah how old already you put switch on the light lah your house also it's not like house haunted okay actually ya maybe I don't know also her house maybe haunted because I kena tap before
I was rushing it was her birthday soon so I was like I was like sewing then I was like trying on the feet lah whether it fits well the shoulders are okay I was looking in the mirror then suddenly I felt like a huge like a solid tap on my shoulder you know you can feel the tap you know and I was like I switch I turn the I turn the mirror like around then I was like I never disturb you you don't disturb me ha I want to sleep you don't disturb me and then I I just I I didn't switch off the light I went to my bed I just play the phone the whole night I don't dare the next day I went to sleep with my mum I was so scared I was like oh my god the heck tap me is different you know if it's like just khayal like if it's like uh you mean if it's your imagination right you will feel someone walk behind you or something but this one is not I felt sold tap like someone tapping my shoulder sounds like
ustaz say they cannot show themselves doesn't mean they can't touch you
oh my god have you seen the the penampakan like and the videos and like got one video right I think malaysia or something
I honestly feel that K lah the one that I I I I'm a sceptic lah like you if you post on macam kan dia orang buka dia orang macam tunjuk kan
dia orang nak views kot
I feel like I I believe more those yang macam amateur amateur ones that macam a that one scares me for real like I saw one kan and he was like
waiting for her boyfriend then they were talking talking then her boyfriend go out she go out with her boyfriend then then there's ada show that she was talking talking talking then she U-turn back go back in the room use her phone
then because singapore I feel like singaporeans by that time singapore was modernise malaysia still kampung kot
maybe dia orang tak no it's not that practice no if you realise a lot like like I said my
can I even say this though it's like like my nenek ada saka kan
but then again for malaysia even now there's people who still have saka
I I like it's hard to find people with susuk in singapore LOL they might just as well put fillers kan it's easier to find a doctor than a bloody bomoh ya that's why might as well just put on lip fillers and nose fillers then you go and find bomoh bomoh pun uh wah golden golden apa tu
uh apa tu susuk emas dalam muka saya biar biar awet muda LOL what
so leceh
for susuk or like if you jaga like if you ada saka ke apa kan kena jaga lama seh ha kain kuning lah pulut kuning ayam ayam seekor so apa tu tangga galah tangga tak boleh
I don't know I don't know I don't have susuk I don't have saka buluh kot buluh
eh tak lah payung
I don't know I think buluh has some
I don't know like how you know certain like I said daun or air garam maybe like buluh has some
dia docker ke apa metal
I don't know I mean okay but I mean if it's galah galah galah galah metal kat dalam rumah apa kalau metal kat dalam rumah apa you need to walk under the galah
but why would you walk under the galah when there's clothes dirty water will drip on you anyway
would you walk under the galah if there's like dirty clothes above your head no why would I want underwear water on my hair
I guess but then again if you do susuk probably you won't you will be more aware lah I mean zaman sekarang I wouldn't know lah tengah main handphone alamak jalan bawah galah bodoh apa the heck but ya
kau ingat kau ingat burger ke apa dah terkeluar masuk balik I mean I don't think it's so easy to remove
but I want one thing I'm I'm thinking is that what did they say once it comes out terkeluar right you because ah you become uglier
that's what they say if your your susuk keluar you become buruk
cerita hantu eh
macam botox ah it's just that botox is err it stays inside your skin
I guess so can you imagine your bomoh dies then you're you're you are no lah eh but then
nazak right I think that's I think that's common ah
so you suffer more when you die ah macam saka ah
you cannot die tenteram
they say when they leave you to put inside your kubur apa tu tujuh kaki dalam tujuh kaki wide thing
you still can feel them lowering you down and things like that they can they can feel you kafan you they they can feel them showering you things like that
it's like pakai baju biasa ah eh please lah you haven't die your clothes so thick already you wear so many layers kafan won't kill you it's just one layer you probably
probably you be shivering like alah asal dia orang tak taruk banyak cloth bodoh sejuk siol bajet ke satu layer jer tu lah pasal tapi eh dia orang kafan sampai tu apa
kain kafan all the way apa guess you have stockings
kain batik just to cover your atas jer but your kafan is all white ah
it's just to cover the face so people don't macam stare at you or something it's just macam you okay if like you eat nasi lemak will you eat the wrapper
no you will eat the rice and the chicken and the sayur all what
mayat jijik ah no but there are cases if you know right when allah tak nak terima your death kan then you apa ada the maggots or like ular atau apa tu nanah
it will push you back out or like your kubur will be filled with water things like that then I don't think the family members wanna keep either they just I think they just probably throw it away or like keep it
dia duduk balik is it
they just I I the one that I know is jangan when they say terima tak or whatever ambil beban ke apa don't just just don't say yes there's no respond
biar allah ambil beban
or may allah take your syaitan
during nazak a lot of people pass cause I heard one time
they had to open the bumbung you know zinc kampung right so they use zinc punya bumbung kan so for like when the person tengah nazak kan dia orang buka dia punya bumbung tu biar
kau ingat kau kau ingat convertible ke apa they had to climb and open it lah kau ni bodoh but ya lah they have to open the zinc bumbung then it's like let the
ya if the thing leaves ah because I think I I don't know if you saw yang jangan pandang belakang they they the thing couldn't get out so it's just sticking at the walls climbing and all until the guy terima nenek dia punya benda tu I'm so glad when my grandma never pass to my mum no it's more like the thing doesn't want my mum
because my my my mum cakap the thing
he's recording sia the thing apa tu
I don't know I don't have a I don't have a saka
I don't have a saka I'm a sucker but I don't have a saka you get me but ya it's like um
don't have worldly desires tak tamak tak apa tu tak jahat tak tamak tak jahat uh apa tu
basic willing to help people gitu ah sincere lah so maybe like
it pick my grandma because of that but none of my pakcik makcik and my mum because my mum was definitely money money money my mum wow she went out to work work work work she said she had no life she that she did nothing but just work I ask her what's her hobby it's work
ya because zaman tu right zaman tu perempuan kena cuci rumah and masak
okay abang so how our renovation plans
hari raya wah you so confident now is still COVID do you think can celebrate hari raya yet
like our siblings four ya I think around there so maybe direct families only can celebrate hari raya
why are we talking about hari raya
so nanti I pergi um
nanti I pergi Popular I beli cardboard
I beli kertas yang keras tu then uh I
cari gambar nanti I print
nanti I cetak nanti I print lepas tu nanti boleh tampal lah dekat cardboard itu
tak lah itu itu kena tunggu nanti nanti bila jumpa dengan dia punya
apa designer itu nanti baru dia bilang baru kita boleh tanya sekarang pun kita kita just um
kita just baca-baca jer tak tahu betul ke tak ke kan
buat lawak ah
kita kita pun tak tahu apa yang company err company itu nak apa nak
tunjuk kita nak bagi kita kan jadi
jadi kita just
kita ambil ambil gambar inspirasi jer lah letak kat dalam mood board itu
hari itu I dah tunjuk you gambar dekat WhatsApp dah tengok belum
ha ya lah habis group mana
corak oh okay ah if it's the kitchen then I like the open concept
betul juga uh uh eh paling tidak nanti kita masak nanti habis semua uh apa itu
uh almari perabot semua berminyak yang hari itu ingat tak yang kita panggil apa itu
orang yang uh cucikan sofa
sekali dia cakap dia punya minyak yang melekat itu apa yang kotoran yang melekat itu actually dari daripada minyak masak
lepas itu uh yang bahagian luar itu yang dekat uh platform itu
yang yang dulu actually nak buat musollah lepas itu tak jadi
sebenarnya bukan nak hack nak nak buang uh yang lama punya platform sebab
sebab platform itu satu dah bunyi dua dah reput
tiga kayu pun dah nak dah nak terkopek dah dah nak reput lah itu dah nak err dia punya hujung itu dah terkopek jadi macam ada lubang
lepas itu bawah platform itu pun kita tak tahu jadi sarang binatang apa mungkin sarang cicak
uh huh buat sementara waktu kita boleh letak vinyl dulu kan lepas itu nanti dah ada
letak vinyl dan kalau ada budget then baru boleh tambah platform
okay tak apa itu nanti
that one I that one that idea came from tak I nampak hari itu my friend dia tengah buat renovation sekarang
lepas itu dia upload dekat uh story
lepas itu dia pakai glass itu ah um dia pun ada that same same sama punya segi balcony lepas itu dia
ah dia dia yang dia yang I nampak daripada story dia lah yang dia pakai glass itu kalau tidak I pun jadi tak tahu macam mana nak replace that that tingkap dengan
dengan apa so idea dia datang itu lah I ternampak story my friend
dia ada tag hari itu tapi I tak ingat ada dia ada tag uh
dia dia popular juga apa eh nama dia eh tak ingat ah
ya habis sekarang I scolding ah everytime they upload video
ah nanti I pergi intai dia punya video tengok apa progress cari idea
abang you boleh tolong tengok-tengokkan tak apa jenis tingkap yang ada you tolong scolding kan ke kat jiran-jiran daripada bawah I
I kan tadi nampak juga ada satu itu dia punya uh tingkap cantik
dia satu yang dia pakai yang uh sorot punya yang lagi satu yang buka punya uh yang macam ketat
uh ketat punya macam mana nak cakap eh yang ada yang ada handle eh
ah tapi cantik dia macam simple saja tapi cantik
tapi masalahnya sekarang sliding pun binatang masuk mungkin dah haus agaknya dah bertahun
tak lah tingkap okay actually dia orang cakap kalau boleh cari supplier sendiri pun bagus tapi sudah lah
ini tingkap lagi nak buat satu rumah already yang kan sudah
dulu bunyi dia tak macam itu kuat tau dulu bunyi dia perlahan sahaja I bila kat dapur baru bunyi
sekarang daripada bilik hujung dah boleh dengar maknanya apa maknanya dia dah besar dah dah sedap makan dah sempat membesar you tak bunuh dia sebab itu I cakap kena panggil
time for a renovation already cannot make cannot lah I cannot tahan already is
him a a liar but we didn't even say that you know suddenly and then he just went off out of the gate like merajuk
you tahu macam merajuk perempuan ah okay lah okay lah apa
saya tipu lah saya tipu lah okay lah bye bye
emotional ah uncle itu
tak boleh lupa eh kelakar
okay whatever you call it ah ya that one also some already uh like uh apa itu
he ask us to go and see the tile but actually he already got a tile in his hand he already know what he want to do for us already merepek right
maybe lah he want to save that way or what alamak then I regret seh sekarang menyesal seh tak pakai tiles yang kita pilih
dah bersusah payah kita pergi hafari lepas itu pilih yang kita nak lepas itu dia suka-suka hati pula habis kita pun tak tahu datang kita pergi ya kan saja
itu lah dia cakap tak tak jadi jadi tak uh tak licin tak jatuh
ya they just give us rough idea there's no three D or whatever pun so
habis uh nak kena plan nak kena
plan itu lagi budget lagi nak kena plan budget nanti you bilang I nanti I buatkan breakdown
kan so kita boleh jimat banyak sebab apa kan toilet pun kita baru buat cuma maybe kalau tiles itu memang
tak bagus itu tukar saja lah sebab dia punya slope pun ingat tak kita kan suruh dia buat slope jadi air pun mengalir betul pergi kat longkang itu tapi
pun masih bertakung tau I cuci toilet pun I tahu masih bertakung macam tak betul dia punya slope dia
uh uh tapi yang macam accessories macam tempat mandi uh apa itu picit-picit nak cebok ah tu semua
uh boleh pakai balik ah so at least itu dah save cost sebab itu pun under dalam quotation juga
ah itu dah save cost lah lagi perabot pun kalau kat rumah
kalau let's say ada budget untuk buat yang rumah punya pun actually perabot tak payah cuma kita just ambil gambar ah kita tunjukkan gambar dia perabot-perabot yang kita ada
tengok tema apa yang sesuai dengan perabot kita sebab perabot kita pun considered
uh apa itu macam modern apa modern minimalist pun boleh sebab warna kelabu macam itu kan senang sikit lah
mm modern juga tapi lampu pun kita dah tukar ingat tak mm
lagi apa eh kita dah tukar eh
so far yang kat dalam toilet itu ya lah kan lampu uh ya so hopefully
mm tak ada lah sekarang plan dia is ini tak standard plan is one uh kitchen two toilet
sebab itu kalau you nak buat kitchen saja ini susah memang dia comes together so might as well buat saja
sebab kalau kita sikit-sikit you tengok sikit-sikit kita buat tiga K habis kalau kerja tak sempurna pun tengok kita pun bingit then end up kita tetap kena buat yang betul punya kan
so kita betul-betul buat sekaligus lah lagi pun toilet
lagi pun uh bilik air dengan dapur dah sebelah-sebelah kan habis kita nak rombak itu lagi kita nak pecahkan tembok itu ah
eh sekali terus habuk semua lah
ah betul
lagi bilik bilik aqi pun
mm bilik aqi pun dia punya lantai pun dah kopak itu kalau nak pasang vinyl vinyl sahaja
dah berapa uh that time eight hundred kan lapan ratus vinyl sahaja dah lapan ratus habis ini
kita kena buka balik sebab nak kena pecahkan balik dekat pintu toilet itu semua nak kena
mm kalau kita buat balik lah
itu kan pintu toilet itu kan dah reput bawah dia itu yang itu nak kena nak kena
hack nak kena plaster balik
semua akan affected
tapi ini click function kan vinyl itu remember
tak boleh lah ini ini kena potong kena apa kena measure sembarang saja
entah nanti tak tersempurna lagi ha
tak boleh dah haus you tengok dia punya
dia punya tengok ini dah hitam hitam itu maknanya dia dah ada gap lah dia dah ada jarang-jarang in between dia punya ini kayu
then how how because vinyl pun boleh kembang ikut uh panas atau sejuk tau bilik
ah dalam bertahun ah ini ini pun macam tak tukar ha ini dah kembang lah ini nampak line dia ada gap
lepas itu tak boleh ada gap itu hit itu lah dia dah ini merekah lah itu
uh uh eh ini tak bagus ini I think murah punya ini bukan yang vinyl tau ini yang
dia orang pandai kan eh
ada record

then the anak thing
the anak thing came up then after everything is like
okay semua orang macam
tengok lah macam mana
I mean aku don't mind I I mean really
betul betul eh aku really don't mind tau kalau dia bawa anak dia
but it's attitude anak dia yang buat aku macam
tu yang buat aku marah gila tau bila the first time aku nampak that kind of attitude and she even say um dah dah ada rumah dah pindah semua perangai tak nak dengar kata aku
dia macam cakap out loud tau macam you know how mothers are like ah aku seorang kat rumah ni
ah aku seorang jer kemas orang lain ah macam gitu dia macam rant
why suddenly the change then dia macam aku pun tak tahu ah semua orang macam perangai
you know you are expecting guests you you already have guests yesterday abeh ini hari aku dengan cousin man datang
to your child and ask macam
kau okay tak
why are you behaving like this abeh macam dia
aku tak tahu ah like really aku aku tak nak malukan dia
aku tak nak dia kita malukan dia like
so aku macam you know
as fake as it is ah aku macam nak try everything to go smoothly tau aku tak nak nanti macam
I mean this will happen ah orang macam
why I come here oi kau eh kau duduk eh alamak standard mothers I I expect that even wati is like
aku tak tahu whether aku bawa anak aku pasal nanti aku tarzan and anak dia perempuan
kau tak tutup pintu eh tadi
okay I take the fault so mojo boleh keluar tak
takde dia nak tengok muka aku juga macam gitu gasak lah kau
okay but apa
so I was thinking aku fikir kan nak macam if we're getting together aku nak order mango tart
dari kawan aku lah but she say she can for weekday she can only do delivery seven thirty onwards
then aku macam okay ah I don't mind
then but at the same time bugis banyak dessert though
dia banyak dessert
so aku macam is it worth it ordering from my friend
err siapa
dia kahwin dia kahwin dah pregnant dah ada anak then she was like posting about anak dia then after that stopped
like anak dia
kan macam out of the blue stopped so aku pun macam oh okay lah
sebab tu lah
dia okay ke tak
that's that's why bila aku tanya dia kan aku macam mm should I ask should I ask
pasal aku tak tahu whether
she is into getting together with us meeting up with us ke tak
aku nak tutup aku tutup pintu jap just in case mister mojo masuk
eh busy kau
kau dah bilang dia lah
oh nanti lah aku tengok aku check kan kalau ada lagi ni pun aku nampak kat facebook lah sia
aku nampak tapi aku macam okay I sent in my interest then dia get back to aku then dia cakap but actually boleh send anytime
actually boleh send anytime
then aku macam tengok lah macam mana pasal err dia cakap slots are filling up fast
so aku cakap dengan dia aku boleh buat on friday which is dengan kau lah there is no way I'm doing with someone else
cause abeh dia cakap pun dia boleh dapatkan orang
tak nak aku I'm not I'm not in school to do that
aku pun aku zoom sekali jer
sekali jer
kau insurance apa ah
ada rider
no ride rider means it's an extra premium jadi kau boleh dapat macam
um that is a um macam
macam mana eh nak cakap kau boleh
kira kan
private hospital macam hospital aku
ya but it's still macam subject to approval ah
but insurance kau kau dapat bila
so shouldn't be a but it's not a pre existing condition apa
two thousand fourteen kira lepas kau kahwin baru ada insurance
oh before asal kau tak ambil rider sekali
recently aku check untuk siapa si
ah dia ada rider anak dia ada rider just anak bongsu dia takde
but maybe it might be some aku can check lah what is your
ya I know it's shield something aku tak ingat ah nama dia
the words juga
kan macam ah is healthshield gold max A then there is also gold max B
ah A paling tinggi B macam down ah
kalau kau boleh check
I mean you can always ask lah bcause sometimes a lot of banyak orang kan kat kerja aku bila aku buat dia orang punya how to say ah
banyak anak seh tak tahu mak bapa dia orang punya insurance apa
macam ah I'll ask your parents got insurance
oh I don't know I don't know semua kau tak tahu apa yang kau tahu
macam these kind of things especially mak bapa kau dah tua
then aku macam
apa yang kau bayar untuk insurance macam kalau let's say ah the basic ah is medishield then kalau kau upgrade and then it will be depend on which company you take ah your prushield
then kalau tak upgrade baru kau tahu but then bila kau upgrade poly kau nak kena tahu whether kau punya is
atas atau somewhere in between macam parents aku punya is just one step below which is B plus is the
rider plan A plus is like not basic ah but it's there so macam
like dia orang kalau pergi private eh so kira macam emergency dia orang kena pergi private they have to pay upfront first
then reimbursement ah so that's why aku selalu cakap dengan members members eh
kau orang muda kau orang boleh afford it why not
memang betul lah kau macam kau tengok macam payah kau nak bayar
yearly kau bayar berapa when you count
macam kau even it out for twelve months
it's sikit seh it's like forty dollars fifty dollars unless you pay like over thousand over dollars ah then
TAQWA apa seh
itu apa islamic punya apa
tapi kan
asal hospital aku takde
pasal I mean
prudential aviva so ni empat jer tau most probably kalau ah qing were to come right she will have to pay first then reimburse
ya so that's how it is lah macam dia dapat refund balik ah kalau
kita boleh try to get electronic letter of guarantee which mean that without deposit so means kau tak payah bayar upfront
ah ah because that's why unless you don't I mean that's why I asked you whether kau private ke
private atau government for your future baby
oh okay lah government you don't have to worry macam kawan aku zahirah
three K dia keluar cash money
aku rasa they have a very big subsidiary for future mums
ah because they menggalakkan untuk kau mengadakan baby dan breastfeed
ya they they are really big on that seh they will get dia sampai dapat apa tu nursing
like if the baby doesn't latch on then dia cakap okay you try this you try that
but tapi bayar lah
oh that time kakak ipar aku punya tak seh
eva tak seh
tak tau pasal dia nak compete dengan private banyak orang pergi private because of that but at the same time people go to private because it's much more efficient much more faster
because of lesser clientele macam zahirah punya kakak ipar
she was like oh aku tak datang period
that time dia pergi hospital dia macam okay this is my err
macam oh I already have two kids I should be okay pergi then dia cakap oh you have a mass
macam a cyst a cyst a tumour or whatever need to remove so dia macam hati tak sedap dia pergi doctor aziz
dia orang ultrasound ah that's why tu pasal dia macam okay whatever I just spend a bit more money just for private
and anak dia semua doctor aziz
this doctor aziz apparently ada berapa sebelas anak
that's what I heard dari makcik aku pasal makcik aku ni ah pun doctor aziz juga
for bidan punya type ah for a gynaecologist tapi aku macam
sebelas sia ramai sia tu anak
tu pasal but dia orang cakap anak dia paling kecil is quite young
I don't know maybe dia masih nak kena tanggung for sekolah
oh pasal oh pasal kau
but takkan lah dia orang takde macam one certain doctor with your condition like this
but aku macam aku pun nak tengok gynae actually aku I I only have one month left sia for me to check for pap smear under my
uh kerjanya insurance
but aku nak kena pergi A&E nak kena dia orang check then after that you need to give some
bedek bedek then in order for you to see a gynae then after that tell them to give me pap smear
ah terus aku macam huh because if kalau aku pergi straight aku kena bayar out of pocket aku tak boleh pakai kerja punya insurance so aku macam mm
is it worth the ten the fifteen dollars pasal five dollars A&E ten dollars specialist
eh abeh nanti the baby macam mana ni
aku kena tolak tepi alah tak kisah pun
macam tak biasa you tahu kan semua alah aku pregnant
dua pregnant semua dah jadi mak
tak aku pun tanya no like aku pun macam
because it's been quite a while apa
ah kau dah ada eh
oh baru juga lah
wow kau punya
tu pasal lah because I know that they said when people go for radiation and this
a that's why banyak cancer male ah they freeze their sperm
ah just for future ah just in case dia orang nak anak then
then aku macam
mahal eh recently there was this guy I don't know what he did sperm extraction
tapi dia punya procedure dah dia dah
kerek procedure dia punya lah panjang mahal nak mampus sia
ah ah patient patient patientnya dia um
abeh macam angmoh
uh dia dia punya wife cina ah ah seh
kerek kerek gila terus aku macam aku tengok then I googled what was because whenever they give us
it's scientific apa
so aku google scientific word ni
rupanya it's sperm extraction for freezing eh hello umur dah berapa tak payah nak ada anak-anak ni semua macam abeh and also because dia orang dia cakap kat situ diagnosis low sperm count
low sperm count apa maknanya makna kau tak sepatutnya ada anak setan
I would I just want to know how much is the price that's all you don't have to you don't have to explain to me anything else diam ah sia
tapi kalau no the thing is kalau kita tak explain
macam dia tak cakap apa-apa aku tak tahu dia tak cakap ah abeh last last kena kat aku ah kepala otak dia
ya I'm there's a lot of times ah orang datang kat kita why is the doctor's charges so high
aiya I don't want to pay kau punya pasal ah kau tak nak bayar sudah
entah ah dah aku kena call sana call sini abeh last last clinic macam
ah abeh aku macam okay then you speak to the you speak to the patient ah
haiya this one okay okay okay okay eh kau tak happy aku tak happy semua tak happy siapa yang happy
bodoh abeh mana aku nak dapat duit aku kalau patient ni kalau patient ni tak bayar

ah aku tak faham asal orang macam gini like there's some people who really like macam so obsessed over
anak dia to a point that dia sanggup buat macam gini kau faham tak budak tu pun kena culik
aku tak pernah tengok sia tu
and it's lepas tu second rider pergi kat sana balik dah orang lain kan
tapi kan bila dia cakap macam gitu ada darah semua teringat aku pasal steven lim
ah adrian lim kesian seh
tak ah
tapi bila aku baca aku macam confused
pasal dia ambil budak tu dari clementi seh
aku tak tahu budak tu tinggal mana tapi dia pergi clementi untuk dengan makcik dia macam main-main kat bawah block
then entah entah dia kena bunuh kat toa payoh jauh tu
tapi yang ada lagi satu victim tu yang dia dapat lari eh oh tak it's a budak melayu tu kan yang dapat lari eh
ni aku sikit hari apa ah few years back ah abang aku tanya aku
ah googlekan adrian lim terus macam
kau ada smartphone apa
tapi internet dulu kan berapa ah
so aku macam oh okay I google for you abeh dia cakap block apa ah block ni ni ni aku tak ingat aku tak ingat block apa ah terus aku macam
why you want to know no why you find hantu ah
then macam tak ah okay lor okay lor
but nowadays macam banyak cerita hantu hantu
but tu dia sacrifice ah
tapi kau tengok ah muka dia macam babi sia
tapi kau dah tengok kau dah baca a son of peach punya yang
aku that time aku baca then tak tahu macam mana mona fandey boleh masuk
mona fandey punya stories pun boleh masuk juga terus aku macam
dia orang cakap mona fandey ni apa uh
err oh lately dia punya kawan perempuan err did something for drugs ah dekat malaysia abeh dia kena gantung tapi sebelum dia kena gantung dia duduk dekat mona fandey punya cell lama
every night dia kena kacau
abeh ada orang macam come to defense ah cakap oh dia macam dia kena fitnah seh
dia kena fitnah pasal dia sembahyang lima waktu then son of peach cakap kau fikir kau jaga barang ni semua tak senang ke of course kau nak kena sembahyang lima waktu seh kalau tak benda ni makan kau
ah so that's why you want like keep your iman
strong at the same time you want to practise all these terus aku macam
ah jadi dia
tak macam selama ni dia tahu macam black magic ni kau pun nak kena sembahyang lima waktu jadi benda-benda ni semua tak kacau kau
tapi at the same time kan aku tak rasa dia ada black magic
that ilmu kebal
aku tak tahu lah macam dia punya intention to just pakai duit sidek ni
pakai duit yang siapa ni yang mati ni then bila dia bunuh then dia just pakai jer pasal she had no intention of covering it up apa
so aku rasa macam maybe the intention is just to buat pakai duit ni bunuh
then on the disguise of ada ilmu kebal
mm but at the same time dia ada practice dia macam small time small time jer lah tapi
macam orang yang kat quaters dekat
malaysia punya
aku macam oh my god oh my god
abeh bila aku kerja kat kan aku punya colleague cakap apa tau eh kau tahu mona fandey oh tahu tahu asal asal kau nampak dia aku nampak satu makcik ni macam dia pakai kebaya semua
ah kau tahu bila dia pergi court kan dia pakai kebaya dia cakap ah makcik ni macam dia dekat harbourfront terus aku cakap mona fandey dah sampai singapore
apa ni mona fandey sampai singapore
imagine sekali satu hari kau pass by kau nampak mona fandey
oh atau orang macam mona fandey aku pekik lah sial
tu lah tapi
kan ah dia orang cakap yang kat quarters ni dia orang cakap ah dia macam selalu asal cepat sangat asal cepat sangat macam from three to six dia orang akan nampak
pasal dia nak kena gantung lepas subuh apa so dia macam alamak asal cepat sangat ni dia cakap jangan cepat sangat lah tu macam ee seramnya aku
tapi siapa yang duduk cell dia akan kena gantung
ah pasal aku rasa cell dia it's just for those yang akan kena gantung nanti aku macam mm and recently kakak ipar aku pun macam dia kakak ipar aku sekolah kan
so dia tanya
sometimes people who banyak orang kena gantung
macam pasal singapore punya amount for hanging is quite high
eh it's quite low kalau macam kau five gram jer kau dah boleh kena gantung padahal tu five gram is cukup untuk kau pakai sendiri then aku macam
banyak melayu kena gantung seh yang kena gantung melayu
mostly malays yang si cina ni semua dapat
so aku macam it's it's already like lah where
apa heavy
tapi kakak kakak ipar aku pun berbual pasal dia kerja kat dalam kan dia pun ada cakap kau tengok ah yang si cina-cina ni semua blue collar sia eh cina-cina semua white collar crime crimes sia and duit dia orang banyak-banyak kau orang punya duit sikit-sikit duduk berapa lama
kakak ipar aku cakap think of it ah look at it
and also dia pun tak tahu ah macam how she feels about the death penalty I mean kalau betul-betul pada aku macam orang yang patut kena bunuh is rapist kena hang ni yang rapists child molesters they should be hanged but apparently dia orang kena serve time then after that they come out mana boleh
pada aku rotan tak cukup sia bro
ah rotan dua empat kali pun tak cukup
atau jadikan subject of experiments
but there's human rights lah so aku macam whatever lah this people are not humans
entah because I think dulu kan dia orang fikir macam the drugs can ruin our children our future
that was their thinking lah so aku macam
ni semua sia dia orang patut they should actually look into it seh
drugs but I'm like pada aku macam
kau sedar macam it's like
a human life memang betul lah both of them play with human lives but then
kau kentut eh
these rape victims may not be macam
they are alive ah but dia traumatised for life
and badan dia orang rabak seh
and badan dia orang may change macam rabak like what if they get pregnant from the rapists like eh jangan bodoh ah
ah boleh makan dalam ah mm
but aku tak tahu dia orang ni semua macam mana
then aku macam
about the human life who have ruined another human like a lot of these drug not drug traffickers I'm not saying about drug traffickers lah banyak dia orang makan sendiri like they use it for their own consumption they are not selling
but kalau kau tengok dia punya amount is not macam lima
aku ada ah ni satu case kat yishun yang pakcik ya uncle lah
ya takde pun hanging
ah tak
entah lah dok
ni semua politic politic ni politic
and also they live up to the stereotype juga lah
macam kat geylang that time aku yana aku tengok asal dia ni macam weird aku dah mata dah tak nampak sangat tangan ada gam
tangan ada gam meleleh-leleh bodoh betul
semua orang sia aku tak tahu bila abang aku masuk pun kita semua macam kita adik-beradik macam tahu lah
but that one point of time bila dia gaduh dengan fizah tu part yang dia kena angkat terus
whatever tu pasal aku cakap maybe right maybe he's a drug user that's why you cannot
aku tak tahu seh pasal
aku cakap dengan dia takpe takpe it's okay
kau tengok eh semua macam couple couple abang aku ada dua anak tiri abang second aku ada dua anak sendiri aku ada dua anak kucing
I aku single parent
eh mak macam mak bila nak clear ni orang nak berak ni
my uncle selalu cakap dia orang macam kalau full kan nanti dia orang tak tahu mana nak
then that time kau tahu dia orang kan dah boleh sauk benda tu sampai tahi pun terkeluar
eh musibut
tu aku cakap okay lah sayang sorry sekarang aku dah tukar dia orang punya litter
pasir it's pee
it's made from snow pea dia ringan
kecil aku tak tahu ah macam mana it's like very ringan ah
and dia punya pea patch dia tak besar macam
ah pasal bila kencing dia kan dia spread jadi dia besar
ah macam kat situ cakap oh pee dia kecil
sebab aku tak tahu lah pasal pasir rabak ah aku nak kena bersihkan
then at the same time dia macam bersepah sangat
because it's very light macam kau orang tendang satu kali tendang banyak
so that time nasib aku punya ah apa vacuum bagus so aku just

kau just boleh ah like pretend that nothing happened like
bila kau beli rokok dia orang tak minta ke

that's all and then the next the next message he sent me was I think like two days ago and he said like hey I know this is weird but can I ask you for a favour then aku macam seram sejuk tau aku macam what favour sia this fellow want to ask
ya like now apa they don't even play music there
only now because now all the social distancing people like go there and like check like if you want to lepak at the beach also
so like when he tell me he want to like ask me for this favour like a part of me was like a a little bit like macam
vindicative so I was like sure even if you get the place kat dalam otak aku ah aku fikir you want to get the place tutup mm it not gonna be fun ya
makan cake
mabuk tak ingat dunia sia kau
tapi kau fun ah when you're drunk you're not troublesome drunk ah
kau tak drunk pun kau funny bodoh
habis kena marah dengan security guard

got no sand nearby so I see already I'm like okay nevermind lah but okay then my ex like no no it's okay got life jacket got life jacket if not you can hold on to me I'm like okay fine sial lah the minute I jumped into the water I straight away like just started screaming like no no no no no I want to go back I want to go back on the boat sampai the freaking thai boat man pun ketawakan aku sial then my ex like no it's okay it's okay I'm like no if you don't put me back on the boat I will cry here now that was my threat I will cry that's it
like a kid like he hold out the hand habis badan aku kat atas tangan dia and even then I was freaking out I was like no cannot then he was like babe why are you scared my hands are right here how are we going to travel ha and then go swimming and all these nice places I'm like um I'll I'll swim in the shallow waters

we are going to entah
I also cannot like panas sial only like with andre also we will cuddle for awhile then we will say good night and we will turn and sleep or sometimes andre will andre andre is a cuddler so andre will like put his hands but then after awhile I will like tell him like it's okay you can move your hand because I know it'd be uncomfortable but that is only sometimes if not he will also turn the other side but I will wake up to him cuddling
it is only when I'm very tired like most of the time right I wake up but then then I see okay lah he already wake up he cause I know he always wake up very early then I say okay katil dah kosong dia dah tak ada dia bangun kan but I cannot like the bed very comfortable lah then I just go back to sleep
so sometimes I wake up then I turun bawah already cause he's doing work right then I see breakfast dah ada
the drunk we know like our kind of men do it like the my the way my ex used to get drunk not like that like he can still function you can still talk he can still like get dressed mandi take out his clothes and stuff and all that lah so

kalau I pakai biasa punya or cheaper one is is fine with me but I more into like luxury bags
ah so one of it that is like my my my my my favourite lah yang I suka pakai
ah okay so beside ah luxury shopping I pun suka one of it lately I like to cook
ah so ah the cooking passion ni pun macam just ah
terbaru yang I macam discover myself that I can the ability to cook lah
so with ah apa the
ah with the time that I have ah may maybe the weekend and also the apa the flexibility that you say orh okay anything lah you nak masak apa
pun you ah you macam you I can try lah and you pun cakap ah okay let's try
we give me the apa the
apa like the encouragement ah untuk
follow follow by the book lah kan ah follow by the rule gitu
ya lah the more the more the the good cook the the good food nanti ah the more ah rounder they become ah
ya lah dulu pun you okay lah not not apa your your form of exercise also is one of the hobbies juga kan
that was apa you suka bermain bola sepak
think ah watching apa football match eh
is ah very different between kalau kita tengok dekat apa
ah stadium dengan tengok dekat
apa on the YouTube or apa yang dekat television ah so for me I pun suka tengok
ah football match and which is zaman gemilang during apa the malay cup yes itu kita berapa tahun eh we were like
macam ah maybe in our teens eh there was the enjoyable time macam anak-anak kita will not
so that time was wah macam
pergi sana beratur going there
then apa duduk kat the bench you know the the the bench yang lama tu kan
dah tak ada cannot
sekarang apa stadium pun dah dibuat baru very macam high technology it can it can actually consist of banyak
uh apa uh spectators you know fifty sixty sixty thousand so
with apa the ability to macam so much apa
ah apa ah the good facility why can't we revive the apa
punya apa ah um
satu message jer cakap ah I be late I lambat
so macam oh so the apa kalau let's say dulu kan technology is takde
so it's like macam oh we will try to our best our very very best to be on time

kira peredaran zaman ah macam kita macam takde oh we cannot say that oh we are so
ah we cannot macam
ikut sangat pada technology nor kita is apa
totally macam ke belakang
I guess at the right pace you know depending on your sendiri punya apa
ah I I think because of the pandemic also macam it actually
menyuruh macam kita ni apa have to apa be more ah high tech
like if let's say macam kita tak tahu apa macam mana apa nak buat apa ah macam dekat apa zoom meeting for the kids
ya we like kita suka apa travelling
ah australia betul

yang penang tu pasal masa time tu penang
banjir yang teruk I think it was
err tiga tahun yang lalu ah tiga tahun yang lalu

the P ramlee dia originally from apa orang penang kan
ah so tempat dia very so called macam museum lah macam museum
macam berapa tahu lah didn't didn't know that much about err apa this rumah P ramlee ni
and and obviously dia punya apa the driver was a eh is a is a indian guy
so dia pun tak tahu macam kalau orang local melayu ah different lah
mungkin kita pun macam macam so keen gitu kan
ah nampak you pun gaya macam P ramlee gitu ah no kita kita
dia orang tua so kita macam kita respect
orang tu pun nak bercerita kan so kita macam ah okay lah we we we
he he talk to us kita mesti reciprocate lah jangan macam oh kita sombong kan tidak
ah orang tu berbual pasal P ramlee orang dia macam gini I think dia dia dia apa pernah jumpa P ramlee lah
mana oh dia kawan um mm
so okay macam we had fun there then kita pergi yang apa tu yang yang the
ah tapi dalam gambar the tower tu macam bridge dia ah you can actually see
ah is a apa is a see through transparent punya transparent punya tower ah kita ingat berapa panjang lah dia punya tower
jambatan tu apa bang is a bridge ah bridge ah
so kita oh dalam kita pun yang technology apa kita kita Google lah kita check oh you must go here
sekali ah tapi raja dia tu takut eh dia takut height
member security apa badan
tough gila tapi takut height okay lah
tapi pergi sana jer eh eh
senonek jer macam it's not that just a just a half a circle macam okay lah tapi kita pun
nak kalau nak ambil gambar mesti tahu the right angle so kalau kalau you
you ambil gambar the right angle orang cakap wah dia ni naik
macam apa macam bagus gitu lah tapi it's very small lah
tapi you kena pakai ni you have to wear macam protection punya apa
ah macam so called covered our shoe tu kan
ah and of course lah obviously you tak boleh apa
ah macam hentak-hentak lah kan
tapi yang kita disappointment tu pasal kita tak boleh pergi naik apa tu the famous cable car
itu we were hoping pasal banjir kan so tutup because ada land slide
bukit bendera the punya famous ah
cable car kalau you datang penang you mesti naik tu ah but
kita we apa tried tapi dia punya attraction tutup kan pasal land slide so we we cannot go
ah so okay lah macam itu macam really disappointed tapi kita dah like I said kita pergi pun terjun botol kan
kita tak tahu apa-apa ah whether masih banjir because on the news totally ah almost tiap-tiap hari kita tengok news
banjir dia dah dah surut ke belum macam we were hoping ah
tapi the thing ya lah kalau let's say kita cancel but there is no travelling restriction we don't get back
kalau macam let's say ah the the minister ah okay no restriction tak boleh pergi penang ah then yes
son kalau topic dengan berbual dengan driver pun one of it is ah apa cakap pasal apa banjir itu lah
a'ah kalau tidak dia kena pergi macam go longer way lah longer route
conserving atau err uh
and one of the attraction kita pergi ah yang apa the apa terbalik tu apa bang
upside down museum itu kalau orang pergi pun mesti because eh
err penang tu like I said dia punya attraction dia tu tak banyak dia punya attractions tu bukit bendera tu so kalau ah I think kalau dia punya other attractions macam all sorts of museum lah dorang buat ada yang macam cup apa
food ah food museum lah upside down museum ada three three three D museum three D museum so kita pergi I think about kita pergi dua ya bang kan kita pergi dua museum tapi yang upside down tu bagus
ada juga ah
kita dapat seratus eh seratus
tapi sana bayaran dia dalam malaysia ringgit bang sini singapore dollar so kat sana pun kalau dorang
charge apa ah apa empat puluh ringit kan bagi kita ah just about
lain cerita lah kan kalau let's say kat sana pun kita kalau beli makan pun in ringgit you know macam alah jangan cakap lah apa rindu lah dengan apa malaysia ada kat sana ah
betul ah
kita family of four ah
can be found ye lah
ah bosan kita tiga orang aja um kita ye lah apa ah apa
kita tengok kita dengar dari news kan oh there's no apa ah zero no new cases no local new cases kita macam harap-harap just make it zero lah make it zero make it zero kan
then kalau macam tempat locations oh dekat sini ada apa visited by COVID nineteen
so we try to avoid lah that that place tapi kalau sometimes it's unavoidable
tu pun tak boleh juga kan macam eh hari tu ada kat ion hotel ah ion orchard hotel ah ah orchard shopping centre
kita pergi sana kan tapi kena ikhtiar lah
what what we can do is that like I say we are wearing mask is one of the protection so kita dengan ni kita good hygiene dah mesti dah mesti instill in you already
ah so let's say kita pakai apa pakai hand sanitiser
okay then ada disposable bag
dua puluh dua puluh satu dua puluh satu tu ah memang apa harapan banyak lah dalam apa dua puluh dua puluh satu
bukan only bukan only financially financially memang itu kalau orang dekat singapore ni mesti
hopefully ah apa naik gaji naik pangkat
okay lah but you know we have to be realistic ah kan sekarang ni kita like I say still in a pandemic situation kan
secara tak langsung kita nak ah apa increase kita punya ah
number of children family members ah tu yang kita target lah inshallah kalau ni in dua puluh dua puluh satu kan ah
ah if everything goes smoothly and the planning is semua betul inshallah then we can apa
have a try another one doesn't matter lah like I said it's a boy or girl twins ke apa ke you know semuanya datang dari dia kita terima lah
tapi tapi kita mesti ada satu kepala lah
kan kalau let's say kalau you ada
you punya vision you tu oh macam gini gini tapi kalau macam orang keliling you tak cooperate tak ada kasi kerjasama akan pengsan juga bang ah so it's like you know kalau you know kalau your vision must be clear ah kalau let's say
tak munasabah tak adil ah macam you you apa
kalau let's say dia dia tak nak ikut kita punya apa perancangan kita cara kita tapi kalau ada masalah jer oh fall back ah datang balik pada you eh kau tolongkan aku gini kan tak boleh lah gitu macam bagi
bagi I ye lah macam you you ni apa kepala keluarga eh kan ah tapi jangan lupa isteri pun ada peranan dia kan isteri dia ialah dian punya neck neck tu apa bang
ah leher pada apa ah
ya lah ya lah so ya lah itu then then then
ah apa kawan-kawan apa relative lain tu anak kita adik kan dia is part of the body lah kan itu akan jadi seorang orang lah kan
special eh tapi you think
ah tahun twenty twenty one dia boleh macam
kita punya kes tu dia boleh move forward tak macam kita boleh apa dapat sekolah ke
semua no semua macam hiccup dia it comes from this pandemic kita nak pergi apa

I have never seen where mister teh tarik is at jurong
like banyak banyak
that one thing you did lunch time right banyak banyak kan
it's still rezeki
was the first one to be senior teacher in that school right because she she stayed that she she she's most loyal one lah down there right and then after that rina uh uh recently only um enroll her into educare you know you know what's educare is like the leadership program that if senior teachers I mean if you want to be a senior teacher in that school then nak kena go and study
I am not sure then I think she have to pay back and all that that kind of thing lah but you think hanisah is the kind to break bond that kind of you know she's not lah but it's not worth it I think it's very bodoh
me or is it she and then I I argue with her over it you know like I tell her don't be stupid you know that kind of thing that four thousand you yourself keep saying you want to leave the school blah blah blah and then after that you go and sign this kind of thing for seven years some more I tell her you know then by the time you leave leave you are like thirty over and then tak payh tak payah nak leave then you go to another school you have to restart again like until when you want to be like who you know sixty year old then you earn another thing again no what
she's been in that school for fifteen years and now then she got to be a senior teacher you know itu pun so unhappy with her you know lately she is undergoing depression or something
by the way I have a footage of him rolling one of my end one child like a bread macam roti

so dia tak
you tahu tak yang like
crazy lah macam it's a wild thing but then
budak-budak ni semua belajar dari mak bapa dorang pe
so kalau dorang kurang ajar dengan mak bapa dorang sendiri
anak dorang confirm ikut punya
tak akan lah anak tak sayang mak bapa
memang lah
tapi sedih tau like I see my parents kalau dorang
dia kan tinggal sorang
hope yang kadang-kadang dia tinggal dengan kita instead lah macam
she's alone dia sorang-sorang kat rumah
so if anything happens siapa nak jagakan dia seh

tapi susah lah I don't have that ah woman attraction ah aku susah nak dapat attention daripada perempuan I don't know why but
tapi kita punya uh syarikat ni kan ada satu yang ada satu macam punya perangai ah
macam mana eh
tapi macam mana kau bilang aku eh kita kat sini berapa orang jer manpower habis tu

macam mana tu kau handle aku pun sorry for you ah but
nanti appraisal dia kasih pun it's up to
bagus eh
ini tak boleh lah
down here ah the way they do appraisal macam mana tau okay appraisal time I give you the appraisal form you you go and grade yourself
actually I was kind of thinking of doing something macam similar
because I kind of miss macam
buat benda like I miss being like creative I guess
so like aku rasa like um
I follow a lot of macam Instagram shops actually and like
because like aku sekarang kirakan aku I don't have eh no no no sorry I have free time now
I mean I'm a bit I I was kind of used to dapat kerja but
yes dah so um I think
I think maybe I want to macam
I mean I I always see I selalu cakap nak
baju you know what I mean but then I I don't know ah I don't know where to start where do you start
I know that a lot of people have like macam
aku aku maybe rasa macam low-key aku boleh I can tell that some people
pandemic punya tu then like
and I mean I understand also lah cause aku pun sama juga
like at first aku pun sama juga but then like
aku macam low-key macam not not jealous but macam
I don't know how to explain the feeling ah I think I think aku macam
it makes me want to start my own not not that I want to start my own or what it's just macam
semua dia punya kedai semua macam sama-sama you know then like
obviously kita orang like feel like we can do better so
the thing is right yang yang kau cakap pasal the embroidery punya tote bag tu it's
honestly kan I nampak pernah nampak dekat TikTok
so like I I tend to scroll through and kadang-kadang I come across eh bukan apa uh the TikTok is like
macam shop punya lah then I saw this one I'm pretty sure it's a or or whatever it's a foreign punya
country punya shop then this girl basically
she does the same thing dia buat tote bag then she pakai sewing machine then the way that she realise
she can do the embroidery too it's because dia punya machine ada dia punya function abeh aku macam dalam kepala otak aku aku macam
isn't that like macam no offence
I understand it probably takes a time to macam like sit there and actually like betulkan settings and all it tapi macam
kalau it's like simple to and it's not her herself tengah embroidered right is the machine doing it
that orang singapore buat so macam kalau is macam simple gitu then like
one particular this uh apa ni account like jual
apa tu spectacle chain or whatever
maybe have baju custom fit for their own
kadang-kadang boleh pakai S kadang-kadang boleh pakai M depends lah uh most of the time S M gitu
then like you know how they have those uh sizes macam
kalau Cotton On they have um S M or like
how is it that this uh yang I tengah pakai ni like it's considered S M then I'm like does it fit every
you M but you on the verge of L like kau boleh sumbat ke ni
apa tu nama dia not really don't really have a lot of free ya loose so ya
to me and you I guess cause kita orang dua selalu baca kan so kita tahu like what's the difference
ada a few kedai kedai macam
online macam Loop Garms
there's also another one dekat jalan pisang yang Flame V that's that's one I always go to actually
because it's not that high sangat dia punya prices but ya like apa
and is actually this ah you tahu uh jericho
like he was really a fan of the nineties punya semua so
pernah pergi area itu then like macam a few times drop by already together
then I think dia selalu berbual dengan one of the owner I think isaac or whatever then um
I was like kenapa kau tak nak tanya jer jer lah but then he macam malu so I decided to do it
then apparently that shirt is a hundred dollars then aku macam
macam mana boleh hundred dollars ni macam expensive gila
maybe it's cause macam maybe it's imported from somewhere macam
then like they take into account like shipping fee and stuff like that tapi macam I don't know it's like
cause honestly it's not cause thrifting is macam
I mean the the concept is the same it's just that vintage kau betul-betul pay the price for the vintage ah thrifting
I mean in I think actually it is vintage if it's like lama gila and like
you can see that is macam been used before and stuff like that it is vintage in a sense but then vintage in my opinion is more like
because it can also be an investment what kalau
that shirt yang chris jericho punya shirt tu technically it can be an investment cause like
they maybe not don't really know of chris jericho ah cause dia kan lama-lama sikit kan
ah ya dia macam punya tu but like
ten twenty years down the road maybe even fifty years down the road maybe there will still be people who's still willing to macam
old like old outfits old trends and then they want to make it macam baru balik it's either they follow
is either they follow the old trends or they take the old trends and make it baru
kita orang just I don't know like how to I don't know how to explain pe seh but I guess like it's been berapa the fashion industry dah lama
ah dibina so like
like people dulu macam tak kesah but like at least now kita orang macam
lelaki tu meant well but then
kind of um macam mana nak cakap eh
macam misused it
right misuse and also macam ya lah just salah guna
I honestly I honestly think it's cause kita orang macam
just kita orang no longer live in that
so like once we use something we just nak buang
we we are actually talking about apa tu uh kedai right
you just cuba lah jual to to your like whoever who's ordered you ada berapa banyak order sekarang
oh tapi belum
orh yang uh yang backpack tu eh orh K
I think maybe you just try to sell to to the current orders sekarang ni yang you ada kan
you once you dah dibayar um
honestly kalau you nak kan promote is actually not that
you can actually macam
apa eh
but then if you buat macam specific ads or whatever right
it will normally show up macam kau bila kau tengok story orang kan it will pop up between stories gitu
it's not really macam
I think you got I think you pernah tag me under
like cause it's very macam it's not only unique but then like it's very macam ikut
demand gitu it's kind of cool
I would I would probably suggest uh macam
kau start with a few design abeh kau
macam kau post dulu then whichever is popular
like kau just keep note like take note in your head which one's popular then um kalau
kalau ada um
orang macam minta or whatever
like I guess you can just macam buat macam poll lah on your story whatever then you just ask like
uh kalau kau tak kau tak macam tanya customer kau like apa dorang nak and stuff like that it's hard to gauge and like what if
kau tak ada inspiration you know what I mean like what if tiba-tiba you
then obviously it will be susah what so I think it's important to have like
dia ada following so senang in my opinion no offence lah kalau kau ada the following kan
it's just easier for you to macam jual benda cause kau dah ada following banyak orang dia ada dua puluh K tau
dua puluh ribu sorry dua puluh K on her main account ya so like
I'm sure okay maybe not all of them will watch but maybe like ten K gitu akan tengok apa
ya maybe like half gitu at most I mean at least maybe ten K
dia tak ada lining eh kat dalam
ya some shops do that kat singapore pun ada cause actually I think I got follow
one I don't remember what's her name but dorang
pernah macam promote a few smaller businesses
then macam that's so cute cause like macam you know like support local ya exactly support local gitu
I kind of macam considered cause you know how I like I love to wear macam outerwear again
actually I considering macam belajar macam mana nak buat cause I love
I love outerwear macam gini I I don't know cause like I don't want to make it like so thick
but I love outerwear gini like I love I don't know why but I think I love the baggy look a lot
I stress out about the fact that I have free time abeh
bila aku dah stress out pasal free time until nanti aku cari kerja pula abeh abeh like I never use that free time wisely
actually um kau tahu kan uh I was considering uh apa tu
uh sambung belajar ya
because my parents are quite okay lah I'm very blessed because they quite supportive lah dorang macam
dorang okay kalau aku nak kerja ke nak belajar ke
dorang macam aku punya pasal nak buat apa but
still thinking about it and then one of the things aku realise
because uh aku dah I know aku baru kerja dua jobs but I I guess my parents pun realise macam
aku macam adaptable cause like
whenever aku kerja senang jer adapt to the situation cause it's just kerja what you know what I mean like it's not really
but ya so uh apa aku macam realise
a part of me macam
I realised that kalau kau tahu accounting
course kau tak pernah tu eh
is I don't know why I didn't do well but honestly is quite simple it's just macam
I don't know how to explain kau tahu macam
tak it's not that um
kau pernah dengar the term macam assets liability
all that right ya is basically is basically macam
how do I put this normally businesses ada accounting accountant
so basically uh accountant ni macam keep track of their balances
macam accounts lah apa-apa account bank account ke apa ke like
there will always be balance right then you can see like kau spend on what and stuff like that basically it's meant to
the job is meant to tengok and make sure that the accounts balance cause if there's
something macam off sikit dorang kena track kenapa off and like
why is it off like maybe dia macam
it's either terlebih or terlalu sikit then they must check where it is lah
aku pernah belajar kan I told you right I I think I took it for O level but I never
um bila aku fikir balik
it's not difficult lah it's just that at that time aku tak interested nak belajar tu benda cause like it's
aku aku rasa cikgu aku just dreadful agaknya ah
but ya then like kalau accounting kan actually ada banyak
ada banyak sector cause you can do auditing you can do ah bookkeeping
if you are an accountant kan kau macam
in a way kau boleh jadi your own boss I guess
I don't know I'm that's the way my parents put it lah but kalau kau
ada macam some form of background in accounting senang sikit kau nak
dapat kerja in a way
because I think the the main thing is cause you know how sekarang kan pandemic kan
so like ah kalau kau fikir balik the main
mana-mana pun food ada kan and um
these things are the macam industries that won't be so affected for some reason I don't know why
and what ah but like you know ah apa tu
tak interested untuk tengok> but I always see that one scene pop up the one where she makes that comment lah about that guy
oh aku tak suka ah plot macam gitu
you know like what we said about sustainable fashion kita orang no longer ignorant
so because kita orang no longer ignorant I guess um
dorang just trying to fit into
betul like a proper cause that they doing like
like black character to be extremely loud or whatever just ikut just ikut stereotype you know what I mean
nama dia jason like in the show jason dengan
honestly aku rasa aku rasa macam mana I I know I had a point but then like
pasal kita dah berbual aku macam lost my point ah mm
sekejap eh
aku rasa okay pasal tadi kau berbual pasal yang hijab tu kan
yang firefighter and then the grey's anatomy bodoh lah it's so it's ah it's just
low-key aku rasa is because dorang ada
fascination dengan budak
aku rasa dorang ada I think right it it low-key has something to do with also
I don't want to say it ah but I think aku low-key rasa porn has something to do with it because
it's not a uncommon thing aku rasa lah K is not that I know
I mean honestly aku uh bila aku I honestly feel bad for her cause like
she unintentionally might have contributed to that but also bila kau tengok balik
it's not not budak-budak melayu I think
I think in general lelaki melayu I don't know why not all
guys tend to macam wonder what a woman okay the woman can be completely covered tapi dorang will wonder for some reason I don't know how
will wonder what the woman is wearing underneath then aku macam
like aku tak akan pernah fikir pasal dorang punya
tu tau
kadang-kadang dorang ada dorang punya argument kadang-kadang is
but lelaki pun kena kena rogol pe something like that lelaki pun ya they sometimes bring that up as a point tapi aku macam
but why would you like it's not like okay dorang selalu macam
fikir kita orang tak faham or like
we always fight for just kita orang but like we actually fighting for other people also what
it's not just kita orang fikirkan pasal perempuan jer it's that just so happens
perempuan suffer more
pasal kita perempuan like
ikut biology or whatever but then
some of us aren't exactly build to macam
kecil I um kecil
okay ah aku faham
dorang masih buat cerita macam tu macam uh it's either kahwin kaya ke
kahwin uh apa tu bukan kahwin kaya not only that uh
ah kahwin contract
aku tak tahu aku tahu kenapa dorang tak boleh single
like okay aku low-key rasa kan
kita orang uh sebagai melayu kita orang actually maybe we don't really
actually had okay lah kita ada nafsu tapi macam aku rasa the only reason kita motivated by kita punya nafsu
it's also by cerita-cerita macam gini that like promote kita untuk
macam encourage kita untuk macam apa macam
oh kahwin kahwin sikit-sikit kahwin kahwin kahwin muda
kahwin tua pun ada kadang-kadang cerita merepek sia
uh uh kadang-kadang kadang-kadang problem dia dalam perkahwinan boleh kahwin lagi aku macam
like like the common plots is always macam apa kau tak boleh produce baby ke
pastu kahwin kahwin kenapa kau tak boleh adopt ke apa ke like why
I I aku rasa tak akan achieve
biasa ah tak ada kerja
tak apa if you nak I masak kan I think dapur tu terbakar terus
cause kan I have a friend uh nama dia amelia
I don't know what she was cooking ah tapi kan dia kasi bila dia kasi family dia makan kan semua kena food poisoning
I don't even know I think wait I think she was baking some sugar cookie entah
I think untuk raya ke pe but then I don't know what she put inside baking soda wait you do put baking soda inside cookies right
okay then I don't know what she put inside that poisoned her entire family but ya selain dari masak is there any other position I can do anything but cooking
I don't mind as long duit halal and it doesn't involve cooking or maths because I'm not good at maths I mean like if simple calculation saya boleh tapi you nak I buat algebra tu semua mampus
okay oh my god thank you so much you know I've gone for so many interviews kan but then semua orang tak nak orang pakai hijab hijab atau melayu like there was this one tuition centre that I applied for they were like happy with my grades tu semua and then dorang dah dorang accept tau and then lepas tu dorang tanya like for my race lah and then like what language I speak tu semua then I was like oh
I malay and then I give him my full name then he was like oh I'm sorry but um the position has been filled so we cannot hire you then I was like bro you just mentioned not too long ago that you wanted to hire me then sekarang mentang-mentang I kata that
I melayu you don't wanna hire me anymore
entah lah and then like there was another company ah err it was an accounting company so I'm from uh I was from a media course then I have a media diploma then I went for this um digital marketing job and the person told me during the interview that I don't have the qualifications but in order to get a job at their company I need to be willing to buka my hijab
kan so I ask lah kenapa nak kena buka hijab and then they were like oh cause they deal with a lot of um western people western clients european people and these people they don't really like working with orang islam
pada diorang kan pemikiran dorang ialah
kita orang jahat so kalau dorang nampak yang company ni ada pekerja islam pakai hijab tu semua kan dorang tak nak work with this company
and then the thing is the thing that upsets me the most is that they paksa the pekerja kat situ untuk buka hijab there's like dua ke tiga pekerja kat situ at first dorang kerja boleh pakai hijab tau then all of a sudden I think new management ke pe ah dorang kena terpaksa buka hijab cause kalau tak dorang kena buang kerja
and then you know ah sekarang tengah COVID nineteen nak cari kerja bukan main susah kan so those few workers had no choice but to buka hijab dorang kesian seh wah aku macam nak sepak jer muka dorang like eh bro what does us wearing a hijab have anything to do with our capabilities or anything my mak kerja dekat company besar okay it's a it's an american company that was bought over by a japanese company
and in this company my mak pakai hijab pun boleh naik pangkat tinggi tau you know and there's ramai orang islam kat situ in fact one of her receptionist just converted to islam
and they are okay with them wearing hijab so what is this small local accounting company so against orang pakai hijab you know I think that's just them being racist
menyampah seh
and it's not just in malaysia that orang islam boleh pakai hijab like there's a lot of countries out there that allows their muslim workers to wear hijab even though I have to admit lah singapore lagi bagus sebab the racism isn't really that obvious here but still though you know my I my uh obek kan she actually works at I don't remember which hospital but then she has to remove her hijab
and she's not even a nurse she's just what is she doing ah uh I think she was doing laundry ya so dude you are doing laundry you don't even have to face the people like the um orang-orang semua pesakit-pesakit so like why do you have to remove the hijab that's so stupid what does have wearing a hijab have anything to do with doing laundry I can wear a hijab and do laundry also
his group was in a different court sedih seh I susah-susah penat-penat belajar squash join squash but then tak sama-sama pun
diana wants to set me up with her boyfriend's friend and her boyfriend I'm sorry to say this okay if you ever meet her don't tell her that I told you this tapi kan boyfriend dia kan tak handsome langsung
ya so her boyfriend is a muka muka bukan perangai perangai dia okay lah like he's okay except for the fact that he procrastinates a lot
like okay I I admit that I'm no saint myself but and I procrastinate a lot a lot tapi kan dia kan okay like there was this one time where his boss gave him this job two weeks ago and then he promised her on like okay first week second week the friday kan on the day that he was supposed to submit to um his work to his boss he promised diana that he was going to go on a date with her
tapi kan you fikir bila dia start dia punya kerja nope the day itself like the day of submission itself
kan and then on that day I I was out lah so I didn't notice diana texting me and then lepas tu bila I check my phone kan diana was like eh babe you free tak nak keluar I tengah bosan ni tengah tunggu my guy and then lepas tu I I cuma layan dia via text sebab cause I tak boleh jumpa dia I tengah kat luar pe and then lepas tu dia pukul dua baru dia datang then the whole time she was calling him and texting him dia tak jawab dia mengamuk dengan diana
kan and then lepas tu dia tak minta maaf tak apa
ya and then lepas tu dia bilang<malay diana kan err eh I tak suka tau you asyik call I tanya I kat mana huh text I spam I nanti I dah habis kerja I bilang you lah you jangan nak spam boleh I tak suka
kan oh my god I was so mengamuk and the fact that he didn't apologise to her like bruh who the hell do you think you are you are not even handsome okay and that's not the worst part okay so he has done that quite a lot of time lah that's not the worst part the worst is that dia tak percaya dengan tuhan
he said that tuhan tak wujud there's no such thing as god
but but the fact that you call yourself a muslim tapi you tak percaya dalam tuhan like why do you even bother calling yourself a muslim
ya like like I respect everyone's belief lah tapi kalau you tak percaya you you tak percaya lah you jangan nak bilang orang lain you don't try to force your belief onto other people
diana dia bukannya halal sangat
tapi pun dia tetap percaya dalam tuhan you jangan nak shake her beliefs tau huh you jangan nak bilang dia tuhan tak wujud tu semua it's up to her what she want to believe in
siapa dia nak sembah kalau dia nak sembah tuhan syukur alhamdulillah bagus lah untuk dia you jangan nak marah-marah dia jangan nak tengking dia kena percaya dalam tuhan boleh tak you tak suka you cari perempuan lain ah
the lelaki is he's a medic so I don't mind medics lah
makes me sound like some narcissistic but anyway I bilang dia ah I bilang dorang yang oh err maaf ah tapi I'm sure your friend is a great guy tapi I don't think kita jodoh and then lepas tu I kata but then if you nak kita jadi kawan I tak kisah
so you you nak I cakap dengan dia okay but you need to make sure that he understands that it's only as kawan nothing more nothing less kawan saja okay then dia okay okay then lepas tu I kata okay I don't him to have my number I don't want him to have my social media account I don't want him to know anything about me unless I believe that you know we can be friends tu semua lah we can click as friends
right I don't even wah he called me golden child I was like so lost like is that is that supposed to be a reference to anything like I'm sorry I watch anime but I don't really watch other shows like what what is golden child even and then lepas tu dia kata uh he he started going on about how so um our friends decided to matchmake us cause they believe we're perfect for each other then I'm like bruh
I told them that it is never going to work out between us as anything more than as friends so you jangan nak fikir-fikir jauh-jauh boleh tak he really believe that kita perfect for each other tau
this isn't really a matchmaking event or anything so like you tak suka you tak suka lah boleh belah like in a more polite way okay then he just screenshot my reply he sent it to my friend and her boyfriend then they they were like scolding me like eh why are you sending him such a formal reply you know you sepatutnya cakap gini-gini you jangan nak cakap gitu boleh tak huh
kesian tau dia then I was like kesian dia I your kawan untuk lebih dari tujuh tahun okay you tak kesiankan I
kan and then she was trying to sell him to me like oh he has a ducati he has a lot of motor he's a medic he earns a lot like five figure or something then I was like bruh I know lah I I mata duitan juga tapi I tak lah gitu teruk mentang-mentang dia kaya you fikir I akan apa stead dengan dia
I ada standard
kalau dia apa kacak sikit eh I don't mind lah and then lepas tu kalau personality dia okay I don't mind but the thing is he just broke up with his chinese girlfriend of like I don't know how many years they were like going they were like super steady for so long they were going to get married tu semua but then um the girl's parents tak tak suka cause um dia islam perempuan tu christian ke pe
ya so they just broke up then then it's like what am I a rebound you are not even that good looking bro just find someone else I'm sorry man ya and then lepas tu sampai sekarang diana keeps on saying that oh she wants to set us up then next time kita hang out together kan dia nak bawa lelaki tu nama dia rudy
nama pun old-fashioned
eww mad ah bro I don't even like the name sorry wah fuck I found I sound so kurang ajar seh no but serious that's I don't know like I just feel like he's not my type like we can never click there's no chemistry between us like seriously who starts up a convo by calling the girl golden child
dia fikir kan we were being match made tau so he's really into the idea like he told um diana's boyfriend and diana told me that he's really up for being match made with me kan that's that's how I reacted like like what with first of all I've never even met diana's boyfriend okay second of all we've never met each other I I deleted telegram
after he sent me that message and then I replied to him I deleted telegram so um I don't know if he sent me any messages lah I haven't re-downloaded it and I don't think I will anytime soon and then lepas tu kan um so diana kata err oh I have like my standard tinggi sangat lah I tak boleh pilih-pilih sangat tu semua so she's giving by the end of the month she knows where I live by the way
I'm segan too but I would rather be match made with a guy who is at least like who have something in common with me than with this guy you understand why when I send you his picture
tak boleh seh seriously do you know any guy like it doesn't have to be we don't have to be anything more than friends but I need someone to pretend to be my boyfriend all my friends all my guy friends are in and they are either taken or seriously weird
I know lah but I betul-betul tak nak seh dengan lelaki ni and I I don't know who else I can go to to ask for like eh you know any guy friends who can like help me out pretend to be my boyfriend for a while cause oh my god everytime I meet her every dude
um apparently um she's meeting up with her boyfriend tomorrow and she said that her boyfriend is going to bring his friend so she felt segan to go along with him because she doesn't know any of his friends but I know for sure that that is code for she's bringing that rudy guy along
cause she'll know that eh tak kan hari-hari ada family matter seh
you know sekarang kan nak masuk masjid you kena macam register dulu tu semua and then satu kali nak masuk cuma berapa sepuluh orang
ya so nope I think I'm just going to stay home but I do need to find a guy ASAP do you think your kakak knows anyone
so ya and then um we there was this one group project where the teachers group us up and then she was in my group so I was sleeping over in school and then after that she kept on touching me and hugging me and wah and then we had a sleepover in school cause to finish our project kan then lepas tu dia asyik macam pegang-pegang dengan I
then like then then like geli seh
she just pindah to like a few blocks away from me in year two and that was when she started um suka I
kan and setiap pagi kan err cause setiap kali I nak gi sekolah I selalu pergi dengan my mak my mak turun kat jurong then I tukar kat jurong pe and then lepas tu kan nanti dalam tau-tau jer selalu I naik I selalu naik kat belakang sekali
like the last door kan second cabin last door then lepas tu I tengok tau
I selalu tak nampak dia tau-tau je pintu dah tutup pusing-pusing tak ada orang dia dekat belakang I
I usually berdiri dekat pintu yang you know pintu yang selalu tak buka
ya I I duduk kat I selalu berdiri kat situ tau I tak nampak dia<malay tau tau-tau dia akan appear dia akan kata
so so I told her that err indirectly like oh um you know um I have a crush cause at that time I was I had a crush on this guy we called him camera guy but I think I can tell you his name ah cause different school pe nama dia
ya but he was err he was in my academic school we were from together and then lepas tu kan um dia selalu macam everytime there's an event he's like the photographer ah so my friends and I will call him camera guy so that people won't know that we're talking about him
ya and then lepas tu that err I keep on telling the girl who like me like oh you know I saw camera guy again today and then he's so hot tu semua then like I would always purposely mention him whenever she tries to like make a move on me
so at the end of it kita semua marah dia ah
then lepas tu dia tak suka I lagi
ya and then there was another girl who like me also and then um that girl was a bit weird lah because she was telling me about how she was asexual and all that then all of a sudden dia kata oh but you know I wouldn't mind dating you
basically it's like I don't really know how to explain it but it's like social innovation tu semua
ya so um we doing gen ed we would combine classes with other courses tu semua so there was this one girl she was from design and ya she was from design school I forgot which design school she was from um she we we went camping together like it was a school camp lah school trip then she was in my group and she was my roommate for the entire trip it was a week long
ya I I I just I just smile and say oh okay sure err I'm just going to do my work over there but you can go on and shower and then and then lepas tu kan so um she's usually not in the room lah like um she she met this she met this uh guy from we were sleeping in a dorm it was a collaboration with a an indonesian uni
my friends and I we will like sometimes we would just sit on her bed cause it was the closest to the door so we will just sit on her bed like all of our beds lah and then some people would just sit on her bed and then usually like we will like macam basah gitu tau dia nya tilam dia you know what she was doing right
at first we didn't know either because we thought okay maybe like dia habis mandi dia tak lap badan dia betul-betul so dia duduk abeh basah and then lepas tu<malay last day kan bila kita dah nak balik then she just told us oh you know the reason why it's always wet then we're like why kenapa you kena bilang kita like at least okay you bilang kita at the end of the trip but but why kenapa tak bilang kita at start atau you tak bilang kita langsung
I did not need to know what I touched I oh my god and then kan the whole trip she would comment on my badan tu semua tau like oh um
apa cause um she's very open her boyfriend is also super open
she said um if if she's ever like uh if she ever wants to do a threesome dia nak panggil I then I was like okay you ada nombor I and then lepas tu lepas tu I tak contact dia lagi
kan and you fikir it was a one week trip okay or was it two weeks it was almost two weeks actually mak mak I I I tak tahu nak nak happy sebab orang ingat I cantik atau geli sebab I terpegang benda tu atau oh my god I don't even know what to feel man
you ada you ada gambar dia
so err he confessed to me in it was in june holiday I don't remember which part of june holiday and then lepas tu kan uh he he suddenly texted me one four three then I was like one four three apa benda seh so I look it up online lah like I I didn't reply I was like looking up what is one four three then apparently it was like this um
so it means I love you and then I was like oh hell no bish like first of all I felt nothing for him second of all I I was in this um it wasn't really a relationship but our I had this thing going on with primary school friend lah nama dia irfan
so I just muted him lah like oh I'm really sorry bro but I tak suka you so maybe you should just you know move on lah but kita lagi boleh kawan and then he was like okay then he stopped texting me then you know what he did
he spam zi qing asking me to like asking her to get me to accept him tu semua and then it was like I don't know how many days he did that but then zi qing menyampah so she she she like scolded me lah like eh can you tell ateeb to shut up or not ah you know he keep on texting me and spamming me non-stop huh asking me to like get you to get together with him then like oh my god I don't even like him then because of that

begging me for forgiveness then I was like okay you know what we're in poly now so I should be the bigger person and maafkan dia you know matang tu semua
so I kata okay lah I forgive you then kita jadi kawan but then we didn't really text a lot and then you know what happen

ah ah apa apa fikir ah fikir fikir is it seems like you
ah apa apa dia
err duduk kat kerusi then
ah apa benda yang dah sampai
ya but dah grown immune lah so macam tak kisah sangat lah
apa dia orang nak fikir fikir ah up to them lah
K if a human's kalau kita manusia tak payah macam err kerja lah then err what would you want to do
 semua ke
 bagus ah  macam gitu
 semua boys
ah  macam planning bar goal lah ni
 macam my cousin
four kids  juga so what happened was uh for them the first three
like just before university lah then  dorang pun happy happy kan yay dah  boleh semi retire
hurrah hurrah kan  mane kita nak pergi let's travel around the world
uh  macam gitu lah  kalau birthday  ni selalu we always tell people that you know ah really ah even when the adults celebrate the birthday kan frankly speaking alamak you know is really ah for the kids you know
it is really for them  pasal macam they really get into it you know  nanti kan uh  bila you tell them eh no need lah anything lah
coke anything also can but the kids are the ones that like oh must put this must put that oh must sing put the candle ah  semua ni kan all them ah
 ini topic eh I tell you eh I think every young adult ah will know this topic very well
kan kan  kita selalu gaduh kan
I think it's more frequent than that kan if only it was only every weekend you know  pasal every weekend kan is when you actually see tau
 kalau you  tak nampak in the week  pun kan  nanti dorang stealth tactic you know uh  behind your back ah eh  selit-selit kasi-kasi you know
ah and they will uh how shall I put this ah they don't even get defensive when you tell them eh how come ah when I was  kecik-kecik dulu tak pernah kasi pulak kena marah kena sebat
no kids uh but I was uh raising  itu my nephews my nieces kan from the time they were young lah um partly because for err me err usually lah I'm not around in singapore  pasal
I was studying away kan abroad then after that when I was working also um I was living abroad most of the time  pasal kena posting
so  selalunye not here so when I'm back usually
my  apa abang or adik already  duduk kat rumah lah  jaga
my  mak kan pasal my  apa parents my late father dengan my mak my mak masih ada lah tapi my father dah  arwah so I moved them into my place lah so when I'm home in singapore ah I jaga all my anak sedara lah
err  dulu mula-mula kerja dengan apa err foreign service
ah  jadi macam err
 lepas kerja sini tiga tahun lepas tu keluar empat tahun lepas tu come back home for about
you know couple of years and then after that you know when the big boss say eh you go ah ah then you go lah so to be honest lah I spent most of my uh youth away  pasal belajar kan you know away in university
then I come back  pun
out of the country the thing is  ye lah kan people always say eh but you come back what you know what's the big deal but I said ya but people usually travel I don't travel I live away
that ah that the big different lah  pasal most people kan  macam business especially you go in go out  keluar masuk lepas tu  ye lah  paling-paling maybe  seminggu you know
 semalam
 ini biasa lah
 tapi apart from  macam bonus  macam grade kan I mean  takde apa-apa macam incentive  ke or
uh is just to put ah  betul lah
ya actually ah your situation were quite similar to one of my good friend lah  pasal kita pergi sekolah sama-sama dulu-dulu kan one of my friend so he was
uh like you accountant also err so actually  yang hantar dia so went to  belajar lepas how many years ah three years ya three years  lepas tu balik lah  balik then of course serve the bond lah
serve the bond buat accounting kan and like you lah also quite good at it  dia punya bond  berapa eh  enam tahun masa tu
not too bad  pasal pun for them  dorang habiskan  dulu baru pergi unlike me lah  pasal for me kan disrupt uh
then ah then  pergi luar lepas tu ah  balik you see so
err  ye lah for
for me a bit different so  lepas tu my friend  balik as usual lah  kita kan
you know especially when  biasa lah kan  ada baby then baby shower
 lepas tu keep up  lepas tu kaya-kaya then  macam every  dua tiga bulan you know eh fed up lah let's go have  teh tarik adam road you know then one day out of the blue kan suddenly he said
you know I thought very good what no  ye lah but this is different I won't be going for posting what you know just stay office counting accounting accounting know to cut long story short  apa dia jadi nursing officer
ah  dekat hospital
until today ah  pulak sekarang COVID kan ah  pulak dia tan tock seng
ah wah high demand  bukan more in demand high demand  sekarang mengeluh aja lah so he saw already like alamak  kene shift work  lepas tu tengok sape foreign worker everyday kan
err I think that's just tip of the iceberg lah  pasal masa period gini kan  kena buat banyak lah I think the most important yang  dorang kena buat triage  macam
 semua bila datang tu kan ah  nanti is uh people like my friend and his team lah then they check and then they ask them eh you look familiar ah because after a while ah
they keep coming back  tahu because now they know what to do like oh my back pain uh  dapat oh I feeling
kan  pasal when you tell them ugh my chest ugh cannot breath sir ugh ugh ugh ah then you cannot take the risk kan
so my friend after a while wah  boleh kenal muka tahu
I mean that one for sure lah it must be twenty four hours  pasal you just never know when this virus will strike kan ah so  sebab itu susah eh for your job  yang last time  tu so you say you cover asia pac  selalunye which countries ah
ah see I'm older than you kan so  tahun sembilan puluh lima that's when I first started on the desk lah so I covered all fifty-four african countries
 pasal chad is spelt C H A D you know ah and then djibouti  pasal starts with a D D J
so I tell eh A to Z know you think what ah fifty-four country you know A to Z A to Z so ya travel there a lot because that one wasn't posting lah that one  macam
you know  dua minggu pergi so two weeks there you'll be like you in south africa
then after one month eh you go back there again then you go to you know um  macam namibia then you go to south africa then maybe you go switzerland
kan um  macam gitu ah but back then ah
ah you cannot stay too long lah  pasal
so from that time ah you know  sampai ke malam ah then even after you finish your dinner you might still meet up you know for a couple of short meetings and then you also still have to do your work kan
so ah it's fun ah especially when you're twenty something kan  penat pun penat lah of course but you know it's fun get to see the world ah by the way this is pre-laptop pre-handphone ah I'm different era
you must understand ah so much harder I mean  dulu
then uh you cannot find uh where you're going  mana ada Google map Google Earth  ni semua right so wah everyone  cakap eh
and I always tell people ya you all ah think now life so mafan ah  susah lah  ini lah  itu lah  leceh lah you know but imagine my time I told them started work ah no laptop is this thing called ah desktop
oh when they  itu ambil lah kan
nah I I've been uh using until today  cuma sekarang supplement uh  gunakan Netflix kan  gunakan you know Rakuten View
ah banyak lagi lah sometimes you wonder still worth it or not
two ah  macam macam dah  tak worth it  gitu lah kan  pulak kena bayar tiap-tiap bulan
 budak-budak semua masih suka Disney Plus eh
I went through that whole  apa uh how shall I put this ah I went through that whole cycle ah kan that whole cycle ah
twinx the magical fairy  ini semua kan that that was I went through the whole cycle
kan then you have to be always referee kan  nanti uh  yang satu nak tengok ini nak tengok powerband  lepas tu adiknya abang I want to watch something else  abang ah then you have to be referee kan then when the cousin  semua datang ha  lagi lah kalang kabut
on uh handphone or tablet or whatever you see ya I bucked the trend long ago I always tell them kalau nak tengok semua share okay
ah  macam Panadol you know
I think fair enough everyone has their own parenting style but I think you are absolutely right  macam mana pun kan I mean cannot lah you know when ipad first started kan I realised a lot of people buy stroller
then there's that little hook that you can put kan  dorang taruk situ then babies are watching it you know I started seeing that very quickly you see so
 macam kenapa lah you know maybe lah you call me jurassic eh  pasal I'm conservative about this thing kan  macam huh why is your baby looking at Youtube lah and this and that kan to me if your baby's crying number one is actually good for baby to cry  pasal dia punya lung
get exercise  tahu
 cuma you don't want them to cry for of course one whole hour then something is definitely wrong go see doctor lah you know but otherwise baby cry pickup usually they will stop crying  pasal babies are
father of four kan you  tahu lah kan  budak-budak ni semua  bila nangis then you  kasi attention  sikit aja semua okay
exactly exactly ah  sama lah
no  pasal you  pun sekarang tengok nanti bila family  keluar kan
you are here to it as family so each one of you are too busy with your Instagram your work mail your Whatsapp so what's the point ah oh my friends  semua marah if I
say things like that you know ah  kena tegur sikit je semua melenting so  macam no lah you don't understand so I will said so what is it that I don't understand I live on the same planet way I have the same family structures what
kenapa I don't tak faham apa-apa you know say you know I don't understand you know these kids ah
said  biasa lah
eh let's face it lah you know even we as teenagers ah last time kan remember when your mother  tanya score  macam mana ah okay lah
lost your homework  kena marah teacher don't know where was your wallet your friend
ah tease out kan bit by bit and find out  semua kan all these kinds of things lah
no I think until you basically die I always remind people  pun kan you know let's face it you know even when you become a parent right your own parents can be eighty plus and you are maybe sixty plus right to them ah you are still ah
people over and over again lah kan  pasal so is true what is twenty-four hour you cannot switch off  macam even  lepas I  hantar last time lah eh my  anak sedara and all that to their school whether it's kindergarten primary school whatever then I go to work
although  ada maid ada  dia punya you know grandmother  kat rumah kan
but I don't think it's it's just you I think uh there are still a small but good number of people yang macam you and that's good  tahu pasal
would to be honest I was teaching for about  setahun gitu for one
you know take some time talk to them kan  tanya-tanya macam mana kan then you realize actually they are quite neglected
mm  tapi kesian juga you know and you can see it you know  macam quite a number of them
seek attention so they they really many of them  macam manja-manja dengan teacher  pasal macam
dah lah  every day pergi sekolah kan and even during COVID and home based learning kan they see the teacher still online kan  pasal
but I can tell you also when we went into phase two kan wah  budak-budak semua balik sekolah kan
no more home based learning for many schools kan wah most parents hurrah hurrah  pasal they can still work from home but the kids must go out wah
 betul kan
 ni macam shift work kan follow the time zone so tell the kids okay ah  tidur eh
ah  betul
or you can travel a bit lah take one day off to maybe  beli-beli barang boleh beli present kan
mm  beli present kan ah
especially if nearer to the school holiday  ke kan
 musim apa musim sejuk
you're lucky if is brown lah  selalunye kan is more like like greyish black  tahu
and then the other thing is I call it slushy  pasal is really that  macam yang that seven eleven  punya slushy you know the Slurpee ah kan  pasal it's
ah the colour of course Slurpee  lebih sedap lah you know
when you walk around kita kan  tak biasa pakai waterproof boots and this and that
and that's the thing I I don't like about that lah  tapi london during that period also nice lah  pasal christmas ah
wah  pergi london bridge
 empat-empat
 kenapa tak pergi itu euro Disney
wah ni mesti makan chocolate ah
 ni nak tengok that little statue of that little boy peeing lah kan
 tengok bola lah wah
correct  sebelum Grab lah mm
ah  itu lah
 tapi dapat tangkap glamour ah
 dia bayar itu lah family ah
your  kawan jadi super sub ah
ah kan  ada
for me last time I would go to manchester  macam a few couple of months I go up  pasal I was studying kan that time
oh  lepas tu nanti one of
not one ah couple of my friends  semua gila bola juga
then  dorang ada that time uh subscription ah
 macam membership you know so but the good thing is being asian  dorang semua mana macam muka kita
so we go and we go  bukan uh division one  aja we don't just go to premier league you know we also look for  yang macam
 pasal takde big name  takde big player they weren't having all those kind of you know hundred million pound transfer you know that kind of thing
mm mm mm I was posted to paris  tapi from paris I also cover uh three other countries lah I'm based in paris but I also cover spain portugal and another country so  empat
country lah  yang kena jaga so for me ah when people come usual lah you know then they'll want to go to euro Disney and then don't forget ah I was also surprised your wife didn't drag you to the
ah  pasal
and  kalau pergi london  tu just outside  selalu ni all this uh
housewives all these  makcik-makcik will want to buy the Wedgwood
ah  dorang bukan beli satu dua orang lain semua order pasal dorang ship tahu
singapore I mean wherever you are in the world lah so wah shiok you know so I was in paris uh two zero four to eight so  empat tahun ah  kat situ
 nanti nampak yang that  lampu tu lah kan  dia macam lighthouse kan every night ah ah so I'll see that light lah
eh  penat juga budak-budak
 naik stroller lah two of them
actually gare du nord when you  keluar pun makanan sedap pasal banyak
halal  banyak kebab  banyak yang maghrebian  nya kan  yang daripada morocco  daripada daripada mana eh uh
ah  ada dua option satu you just  naik yang lagi satu boleh makan
really a shock to to many people when notre dame burned down  pasal that thing has been around for so long
and it's  macam symbol lah paris kan so  bila
 bukan sabotage  bukan ada terrorism
 sedih juga pasal orang kalau naik boat boat  ni semua dorang touring kan it's really really
ya and I do miss uh living there  pasal it's really one of the most beautiful cities in the world lah you know without a doubt lah you know
paris eh  memang really made for walking even compare to london you know london  macam K lah you can walk a bit a bit lah  tapi after a while  macam
ah boring you lose your way and then is quite dirty also you know in london you know and  macam after awhile there's no change in the scenery kan
 kena tengok bawah lah  pasal dorang banyak apa itu taik anjing semua ni kan
they got lah  nanti after COVID
after COVID even for me  pun frankly lah eh  lepas I came back two thousand eight
after that I rarely go out anymore lah  pasal pun tukar kerja then
basically mostly  dekat singapore lah
 tak tak keluar-keluar and it's by choice lah  pasal
you know is also question of family and a question of you know looking after people especially my  mak kan seventy seven this year and ya so she still lives with me I don't live with her she lives with me there's a big difference
and also then for me travel just means basically usually weekend ah  masuk johor lah
mm and also  pun aiya you know  boleh beli barang-barang lebih murah you know and many
things are easy you know and even when you've got kids kan like I've got even uh grand nephews grand nieces kan  yang dekat malaysia then its easy to uh go to
Legoland kan  pergi makan-makan
only be able to travel kan pergi johor and whatever  sebelum kita boleh really go out there again lah
know  dekat-dekat lah you know maybe
likewise also we need them for workers you know um  pasal every day before COVID kan between two hundred to three hundred thousand eh  dua ratus tiga ratus ribu tahu kan  bukannye satu dua ribu kan
you know we need each other and but you're definitely right  pasal apa dia punya
 penjaja all the businesses it's very hard for them without us you see
obviously lah but also don't forget catered also for the johorians who work here  pasal
as soon as you hire one kan then  dorang buka kan payroll payroll  nye tu ah so  dorang gunakan apa dorang gunakan Nets
ah  dia by two kan when you go there  sekarang some shops lah they definitely accept Nets which is good lah you know
 pasal even for their workers kan  lepas tu balik malaysia lah  nak kena pakai ringgit pulak up kan nak tukar duit
kan when their salary is already in sing dollars so  dorang alah pakai Nets aje lah  lebih senang
 tak susah
but you can tell ah  macam the shopping mall over there you know you can go onto all those sites kan  yang nanti orang ambil gambar ambil Youtube ghost town  betul lah
is really bad  macam city square tu kan
um  orang semua tengok wah really really ghost town you really really wonder how they are going to survive
ya hopefully lah it'll be a slow and painful process lah but you know everyone is going through the same thing so it's not  macam kita aje kan you know
is everyone everyone is going through the same thing so  macam gitu aje lah
ah that's always good question  tahu pasal macam orang selalu cakap you know to me  macam each one is so different kan so
you know ya  pasal dulu pun when I was a student then you know lah budget pun  bukannye banyak kan even though you know you got sponsorship and this and that so we are the type  macam
you know you just  ambil gambar ambil gambar
and that's it you know  macam you  tak appreciate the country you don't really appreciate the culture you  tak duduk bersimbang-simbang you know have the equivalent of  teh tarik with a local you see
but as a working adult that's what I did lah you know just to go round and then lose myself in the crowd  lepas tu berbual-berbual with the local or foreigners who live there you just make friends kan ah so for me that's where it's quite you know
but I must say um not so much now lah but in the early days then hanoi was really good destination for me  pasal that was my first posting I lived there for four years ninety-seven to two thousand and one
and that was the earliest  yang dorang  baru jer  buka kan err
 orang asing you know so was a lot of fun lah you know and then after that even after I left I made it a point maybe every three years to come back visit old friends
bodoh seh
sedih oh dia macam like kau faham tak faham the question I give you one more chance I had to like balik and google apa ni aspiration aku tak ingat aku macam something like oh I want them to be inspired and ah like push themselves like for their art and creativity and with their talent set or with the skill set that I have I want to pass it on to the trainees
penat penat seh asyik kau kerja
bila kau start kerja baru ini fourteen december berapa minggu jer
excited the place is near your house kenapa tak mana kerja aku cause di sini sia ada macam some kind of progression
kau dah buat berapa lama di tempat ini wow that's fast ah
so moving back into like your um cakap siapa tadi
bila dia orang boleh masuk singapore
apa tu barang fashion ke barang household rumah ke barang fashion jenama fashion orang keluar masuk kedai kenapa apa seh
orang beli bag warna-warna buat apa
so I was I was sleeping and thinking about it and guess what when I was half asleep I paid for that freaking app that was so bodoh of me it was a yearly subscription of sixty something I'm so pissed at myself for like the I paid for it so why would I want to cancel it correct
that was so bodoh of me
later you help me out tolong aku I seriously feel so bodoh realising I bought an app when I was half asleep
really really except for those who are working shifts and dekat the
finally after so long of working shifts penat seh kerja shift
bagus berharap kau boleh stay kat this job lama I find that
I noticed that your previous job I mean you worked well but just that the company closed down ke apa ke and it's always like unexpected suddenly
dia cakap besok semua try to avoid going to town in taxi all that is going to be packed eh I thought people stop to go to retail shop to buy stuff
but I think my weakness is makan asyik pergi makan jer as much as nak buat melipat kan macam need to plan for the week
I think the intake is only for like ten days worth ah I think kena makan for like tiga bulan atau empat bulan untuk the
fifty dollars for the um the therapy and then thirty dollars for the yoga therapy so the poses the yoga poses that they taught me was more for menses punya routine to relieve menses tu
I think I will show you later later I forget and then for treatments lah this thing because my next appointment is in january which is like what lagi dua bulan
but but dia cakap kalau boleh makan more sayur-sayur but sayur pun kalau bagus like asparagus don't eat mushroom I don't know I know right I have been eating mushroom cause I thought they was the easier to eat
and then like avoid potatoes but sweet potatoes is okay no milk I mean I'm lactose intolerant no spicy food pedas-pedas tak boleh you know I feel like your body tell you already what you can or you cannot accept right so we will all along I know that I cannot eat pedas punya makanan because I will just go to the toilet
to shit yes of course yes that and then I will go to toilet susu pun sama but apparently one I think a few years ago at my business partner house lah we all cook this interesting dish lah so it tasted like those kung pao chicken so instead of using santan the coconut milk we use greek yoghurt
so it felt like and then the spices that they use macam make up for it macam it looks like yes something like that but I think it's like purely indian food interesting
actually kan I've been wanting to eat more plant based because it's good for us yes I mean yes for my dad yes the kidney issues and then the diabetic I mean I read some articles where people go plant based um their kidney macam feel better one of it is a friend of mine uncle dia kan macam quite a high stage diabetic lah then he had to err inject insulin
inject insulin everyday and then when he changed the diet to like plant based within the next six months he didn't need he don't need the insulin anymore so it's like our body got a lot of like macam too much meat from then
so I've been wanting to eat more plant based just that cara nak masak pula because we are so used to like masakan melayu masakan wastern yes rice is a staple but there are other form of carbs what other vegetable have all have carbs fruits also have carbs is just a matter of taking which one and some buah-buahan
too manis yes but some buah got higher natural sugar in it I can't remember need to refer to the list
nasi I makan nasi basmati so
penat because kerja satu hari bangun pukul tujuh lebih pukul enam lebih keluar rumah pukul lapan mana tak lambat three thirty ah menahan menahan taxi
I was stuck at home apa tu actually aku aku mahu see yang tu juga mm mmhmm
I know right you always take the bus early or late oh earlier lama dia then what did you do take train
creamy meatball are there any other sayur inside your bowl
wow mana ada ini oh I don't remember adding the ice cream
yes but I don't like the place ah I don't like the inside ah so busuk cause I sat near the kitchen so sempit
benda leceh saya nak buat actually
buat basic cause meal prep can be interesting if you know how to do it well
nak perlu impact oh habis kau tak pernah pergi rumah dia
kan lepas tu dia cakap macam kind of um okay no
masa itu masa itu emas time is golden
she ask me that you haven't kahwin that time I thought you kahwin already then she ask kat apa
she say that time I fall down only I kahwin next year aku kau
want to be what dia cakap
who's that siapa tanya
you have to plan lah all the content but there are some influencers right when they post something ah you are so convinced to buy the item wah the person say bagus ah this one okay ah I try also
maybe they are selective lah yes yang macam cakap boleh bagus
but I think nowadays if you want to do your own side business food is always the easiest people like to pay for food makan sedap jer then what about those like unhealthy
I don't know what to eat tomorrow for lunch asyik-asyik makan sandwiches but the one from seven eleven stew apa I mean it must be strong in kimchi flavour
kenyang tak why you heat it up a warm meal then how does it taste like when it's warm really
it wasn't that bad but okay lah yes ramen spot is the best like kat mana opposite lau pa sat kasih area gyudon
poke bowl I don't know salmon what did you eat at lau pa sat yang dekat lau pa sat itu is it like the soy based or the miso based or
I saw that I saw the person macam mana dia apa sushi cake eh the salmon cake savoury cake savoury sushi cake yes is like a decorated cake but it's like all salmon mentaiko all savoury I feel we should have that for our next birthday
it's filling ah kenyang ah
pucailok the long bean with like asam I don't like the corn just the long bean and you eat it with the you know scrambled egg like the side nasi you how about you
hello hi how are you I nak minta tolong sikit lah boleh tak
tu lah my parents nak makan nasi padang ah but I don't know where can you
recommend I don't know where is the best nasi padang in singapore I mean I know the the usual ones they have they always like to go to their favourite is like hajjah maimunah you know but other than that cause hajjah maimunah I went went there just now today they're not open
mm tak kisah lah
I think I think I know I think I know yang mana satu we ever seen that place before but don't think I've tried sana sedap eh
oh is that type lah I mean you have to queue and buy you don't have no need to make reservation all that kena eh tak payah eh
oh sebelas this is for lunch lah
ya nasi padang I think the most of the places jarang ah eh I think but there's one place I don't know you pernah pergi ke tak dekat-dekat sana juga apa eh nama dia I think it's called sari ratu you pernah pergi sana buka I think like pukul sembilan malam pun dia masih buka tau
I actually have no idea but I pernah pergi makan sana pukul sembilan malam gitu
dia punya lauk masih still looks fresh lah tak tak rasa macam
since pagi ke apa maybe dia orang masak petang juga but okay lah kalau in case you keluar dengan your family or your friends
tekak you nak makan nasi padang you don't know where to go ya it's it's I think they have a few other outlets but the one I went to was I forgot the name of the road lah but it's it's quite near the kampong glam area like baghdad street or something like that
oh apa nama tempat dia eh
ya I think the the mall itself is a expensive mall kalau pergi sana I think
okay lah I think I will try that that what minang place there
ya then that's the plan think I'm bringing err my parents dia orang nak makan sana cause just nice lah think after that I boleh ke nak jalan around the area beli kain-kain ke apa-apa
that that area got a lot of kedai-kedai macam gitu kan jual kain lah jual buku-buku lah jual baju lah carpet lah
tak tahu eh belum ada plan but around that area got a few malls kan
for the house I don't know like pinggan mangkuk ke apa think whatever ya lah
dia orang nak beli I think nak beli macam periuk-periuk tempat masak I think can bring to think bugis junction quite near
ya lah I think everywhere lah the same but now if possible duduk rumah more ya cause if you have to go out also yang no choice then kalau nak keluar you buy whatever you need to buy you beli dah beli dah makan ke apa then terus balik then kalau you nak merayap pergi mana-mana sekarang makin
code sometimes you take the code also still need to queue nak kena tunggu and go there go to the shop for less than five minutes
true I think now banyak orang buat gitu lah tapi kadang-kadang barang macam baju ke apa you nak beli kadang-kadang you beli online you tengok colour ni
nanti datang colour lain
kita kita boleh hantar balik kan dia orang boleh
tak boleh refund ke
wah ya lah and gambar you tak boleh cannot
trust kadang-kadang
then in the end what happened did you makan the nasi jer
I think I think got banyak lah I dengar complain for me that time I order but I didn't I didn't I didn't order for delivery I think I order for sometimes you can order
untuk self pick up you know you order then you pergi sana sendiri you you you
you pick up the food sendiri then I order at first they say the food should be ready dua puluh minit then I dah sampai sana I tunggu almost one hour baru the food siap
that one lagi self pick up kalau I tunggu dia delivery I think mungkin more than one hour but this was back then lah during the time time circuit circuit breaker
think nobody nobody nobody can say they never order grab during that time I think semua orang order
pernah order grab takkan hari-hari masak kat rumah kan
tu lah nak makan kat luar kedai pun tutup then bila order tunggu satu jam ya lah that time I I ada satu friend pun dia ceritakan dia order I think err mothers' day I think
ah dia order pun dia order err
dia dah order tunggu lama-lama the punya app cakap waiting for driver nak dekat dua puluh minute in the end tak ada dia dah order order order tunggu tunggu tunggu dia cakap cancel dah tunggu twenty minutes uh huh
day ada orang dah advance order the day before to arrive for example eh dia cakap you order for today esok dia suruh deliver for makan tengah hari
pukul dua belas ah on the next day lah they advance order lah then when it comes on the day half an hour before dia orang cancel dia punya order
orang orang nak buat celebration dia orang buat macam gini tu lah
ya lah but the the the the grab driver sometimes it's not their fault lah it's all the the the the restaurants kadang-kadang dia orang pergi sana then restaurant yang cakap cancel but dia orang tak fair lah then the driver the rider kena marah
I think maybe for safety juga lah I think kalau satu not not dia orang punya tanggungjawab kalau dia orang pergi check and then the the let's say the deliver deliver lepas tu orang tu cakap eh dalam eh inside my my packet got
for example lah dia cakap I see hair then they complain kat restaurant nanti restaurant will cakap eh but the rider just now got check your food so maybe the hair come from them
I think the restaurant dia orang lah pasal dia orang yang pack makanan so they have to make sure everything is there cause the delivery the grab delivery guy kerja dia is just to send so kalau
ya ya lah you can see tengok kadang-kadang dia orang hujan ke panas pun dia orang dia orang still delivering
ya but what to do ya but I think got one time I heard err I got one friend kawan I satu err whenever dia order
kasih dia orang tip kasih cash ya lah but sometimes a'ah dia kasih extra like maybe two dollar ke lima dollar
I tak tahu lah I think so but I think maybe
maybe dia orang order often so maybe once in a while they order then ya lah but good lah then these people they they they don't ask they don't earn a lot what kalau dapat tip and not say
kerja dia orang senang ya lah senang as in cuma ambil makanan hantar makanan tapi kadang-kadang nak kena layan yang customer complain lah customer marah so I think once in a while ada orang
kasih tip macam gitu
kasih dorang macam motivate dia orang lah at least ada juga orang yang
baik hati kalau tak asyik kena marah jer
tu lah cakap cakap pasal gitu kalau nasi padang dia orang ada deliver kan bagus eh tapi I cari semua tak ada
tapi nasi ambeng ada deliver tapi nasi padang I think tak ada
kesian lah
dia tak ada offered to refund ke apa-apa that's not good actually
cannot lah the customer dia orang bayar apa
so nanti esok you nak ikut tak I nak pergi cycling mm
I think kita dah quite long time kita tak pergi changi beach lah
takpe lah we go kita pergi early lah morning you know I mean by by tengah hari we should be done then can can go back
for lunch ya lah this quite some time I pun dah lama tak tak ride my bicycle
you punya bicycle masih ada tak then okay lah is it the same one that you beli dulu
cause recently I think that day I I I ada beli I went to the bicycle shop lah to change to buy new helmet cause my helmet dah dah koyak dia punya strap I was talking to the owner of the shop dia cakap sekarang like everyday dia jual like maybe
I think so cause that time dia orang tak boleh
wherever lah tak boleh pergi makan luar tak boleh pergi tengok wayang lah tak boleh pergi shopping lah
I think dia baru baru buka lah aiya maybe I don't know tak tahu eh
maybe lah I think they they the the new movies I think maybe kalau rasa
you rasa kalau dia orang keluar pun sekarang mungkin tak siapa yang nak pergi
tengok maybe they wait lah they wait until maybe the the cinema allow
ya there's no apa
esok esok kita pergi to changi after that after that kita pergi makan nasi lemak nak mm
okay kita pergi the famous one lah kat sana yang changi
I think the I don't know I think maybe the sambal lah okay the rest of the outlet should be the same
esok kita boleh try lah kalau kalau kalau makcik
beli I senyum kalau pakcik then you senyum okay think just nice lah so we go cycling then go nasi lemak ya then after that we head back
tu dah macam yang kat bangkok kadang-kadang boleh panas
abeh orang boleh pengsan gitu ya
I think dia punya macam
ya lah I think dia punya mungkin usually like that dia punya dia punya what you call that dia punya longkang ah dia punya drainage sumbat of course lah then kalau dia punya rain was like that day
pagi sampai petang what six seven hours ya lah
if the rain that much then the drain sumbat mana air nak pergi
ya lah tu nanti kalau dia orang ada rumah yang those landed property
okay lah but this kind of weather I think susah nak predict kalau you tengok panas kadang-kadang pagi hujan or the other way that day pagi hujan lebat then dia stop
I think dia orang also just tikam jer lah
maybe it's the other side maybe you kat east side tampines maybe kat choa chu kang ke jurong yang hujan right mm kadang-kadang like like that what not the whole singapore
uh oh kesiannya then
mm mm that means ya lah lama lah
I think most of the the what you call it apa dia panggil dengue hot spot eh dah banyak dulu I think tak banyak tempat I think near my place also kat pasir ris ada there there there's err
one case opposite my block mm ya but sometimes when you hear this kind of thing then you you you worry what so that time when when my my mum dengar then terus dia pergi luar dia check dia punya pasu-pasu bunga make sure tak ada because kalau the officers datang
they can summon you kan I think ya so kalau you have like tak lah
I tak tahu I think they come random lah it's either that or either that or I don't know eh mungkin kalau ada neighbour yang complain tak tahu kalau the neighbours suspect you you tak
maybe lah maybe dia orang they they take I think I'm just guessing maybe dia orang take like a a sample
of the water something like dia orang bawa
dia orang punya lab agaknya dia orang check I don't know cause if not
they they won't see what I think need like at least like a magnifying glass or like a microscope so maybe they bring back lah they take some sample of the air bawa balik to lab then run dia orang test agaknya lah but ya lah sometimes they will check what even if they cannot see kalau dia orang tengok let's say rumah you
ada ada plants ada potted plants then dia punya air dia tengok eh macam tak tukar they will tanya apa nanti dia orang tanya dia punya air do you change everyday because by right you kena tukar so at least if
happen to be the nyamuk bertelur kat situ kalau you tukar hari-hari
then dapat dapat
but you you get to buang dia punya telur apa ah kalau let's say you
tak tukar I pun tak tahu I pernah baca I don't know lah maybe takes a few days lah maybe like four to five days for the whole process for the nyamuk
telur to tukar lah so kalau you leave it for that long then maybe you might kena summon lah kalau dia check so that time my my mum dengar dia terus check
ya lah kat rumah pun semua tukar at least everyday lah
ya lah so kita
kalau ya lah because the the like what's the
the way cause I read on online the way to differentiate they say this mosquito dia punya kaki tu ada ada belang-belang ada belang-belang
tu lah
kalau you kena gigit pun mm
so I think if you if you rasa macam you kena gigit dengan mosquito I think you just
or you just monitor lor dia punya mosquito is not the aedes mosquito you you won't have fever what if after you get bitten then dua tiga hari lepas tu you demam I think better go doctor you check
ah tak ada dia
mm then that one can can can lead to complications lah kalau tak kalau biasa punya after some time it will it will get better ya lah but leceh lah you know means you you if you get bitten by the aedes mosquito then you kena dengue
then you cannot see what kalau dia nak gigit you dia pun tak tak warning
the the numbers just recently I think I think india in one day dia punya the number of cases for COVID lah was like six almost sixty thousand just one day
these countries I guess because dia orang punya
ya then some of them might not be even kat hospital you know
ya ya lah because the that time when they they they were checking on the dormitories I think all the foreign workers tak boleh kerja kan
semua orang first time pun tak tahu ya but
foreign workers was was told to quarantine eh quarantine themselves duduk kat dalam dormitory tu kalau I tak tahu rumah you you tengok rumput-rumput pun tak ada orang potong macam dah macam hutan kat my office pun sama dia punya
dah tak terjaga ya lah that shows
the foreign workers are important only time time macam gini then people realise oh ya ya lah this during this difficult
period you boleh tengok macam orang yang what you call that essential essential workers you can tell like macam those tadi kita complain pasal grab food driver and all that ya kalau you imagine kalau dia orang tak ada that time circuit breaker you nak makan macam mana
we wait for the food one hour it might be even worse without them maybe you order morning your lunch baru dapat
and all these foreign workers now then you notice that without them nobody bersihkan know your around your area under your block all that
ya lah but tempat your workplace how you still going to work or
when that day I think I was at the area lah raffles down there lah you can see I was there lunch time macam tak ada orang mm can see that there is definitely different lah you see the lunch time crowd macam more like a ghost town I would say
including my my tempat kerja pun I think in ya I think in future maybe this is what I I I I guess would happen lah sooner or later most offices also would wouldn't be might be might be smaller you know
cause you realise that most of the employees also don't need to be in office cause sekarang dah berapa tiga eh dah tiga since march dah lima bulan dah
working from home still masih survive apa so why do they need to like rent office mahal-mahal duduk kat rumah pun tetap business jalan
kalau you kat rumah pun at least you save transport right if ya lah our train here not expensive but if you talk about one month how much maybe
maybe the only thing yang you spend more I rasa mungkin is just your utilities lor
kan bila at home
if not usually you are at home malam-malam and weekend but now it's like twenty four seven hari-hari
because bila dulu time sebelum all these terjadi orang semua nak keluar so sekarang dah gini semua takut semua nak duduk rumah
ya betul
iya lah mana dia orang nak pergi
airline pun even the airline nak pergi pun the the the I think the government doesn't allow
kat singapore if you boring also I think singapore even though kecil still got a lot of places if you want to explore
give them more things to do if all the businesses tak buat macam gini orang boleh jadi gila tak ada benda nak buat
takkan nak tengok jer eh but everything
ya I think like hari-hari dia orang boleh tengok semua habis nak buat apa
ya kalau tak it's not like kita
we said what the wayang orang nak tengok wayang pun the cinemas belum buka so
a lot of shows right like if if if they have those new macam wayang I mean filem-filem yang baru mungkin more people will will go kalau tak ada orang not interested ya lah at least they have entertainment at home or more
your ya but I think no choice lah sekarang semua kena gitu
ya like dulu pun macam apa tu during bulan puasa orang nak bayar what you call that the zakat fitrah ya but now also everything online what dulu people would queue at the
masjid you know mm even
the yang baru lepas hari raya haji korban also not allowed then some people just do overseas then they will just maybe take video or whatever then send all all consider now digital human no more face to face
ya I think all the woodlands jurong I think they were I forgot I think tak salah I ada sepuluh ya ten different places where they have the celebration lah ya
ya kalau dia orang buat dekat the same place then more people will go there what so I think they have to lah to to elakkan orang go to like the padang or marina marina floating platform all that so
they just do at their own neighborhood so people tak akan you know berkumpul at the tempat which is better lah everything lah like err I think in other countries also you the this year I think the olympics are suppose to happen
ya lah cannot lah some more lagi that kind of event I think you're talking about
saw got people post gambar-gambar yang the river singapore river lah the some of the beaches the sea looks
nobody driving around ya their air cleared so tak ada macam berasap-asap lagi and then kita kat sini I mean we don't experience that that lah but for me personally I tengok bila during circuit breaker tak banyak kereta you can see like you said bila kita pergi jogging kat luar ke apa macam
lagi fresh dia punya air tak macam dulu tak bau asap kereta right ya so I think ya everybody complain complain complain there is good also lah that come out of this people realise like you say just now people don't need to shop a lot
apa yang yang I nak cakap you tak payah spend so much you know to to actually to to enjoy yourself to keep yourself happy ya just do the simple things
some friends also they start you know some some of them do business lah like they bake and then sell some of them for themselves lah but at least it gives you time to to to learn something new you so you ada whatever lah
hobby baru ke apa ada yang masak ada yang boleh tak tahu lah eh
main gitar bernyanyi lah
ya kalau if this thing didn't happen you you'd takkan tahu yang all this thing you boleh buat so actually sometimes instead of complaining you can just look the other side lah or what
kita complain complain hari-hari pagi petang malam pun you complain also the thing will still remain then takkan today you complain then tomorrow you do the same thing
true ya but I guess people are just people dah memang lumrah orang manusia ni kalau tak complain dia tak puas dia mesti ada benda nak cakap right
macam ni lah government government kasih duit orang complain government tak kasih duit pun orang complain
betul kita cakap orang pun I think kadang-kadang I pun complain juga
sometimes you say it's bad but then if people say otherwise it's good you nak kena tengok you tak boleh degil you know nak dengar cakap you jer
complain but at the end of the day I think especially kita kat sini kat singapore I think kita still not as bad as you compare to other countries
you can't even I mean you can maybe you boleh pergi beli pasar mungkin you boleh beli
beras all those barang dapur tapi dia kasih pergi mungkin
satu minggu sekali but still singapore I think
itu pun ada orang kan that time berapa a lot of people masuk facebook masuk stomp tak nak pakai then kena kena all the officers suruh dia orang pakai pun dia cari pasal
ya by right bukan susah benda tu nak ya lah macam like
I see them tu lah that time
government kasih free leh nak minta dia orang pakai
I mean there's a there's a there's a feeling lah rasa macam
kaya apa dia orang ya lah
kan tapi dia blonde

kakak famous
I feel you I feel you okay ah there are also macam there are also perks to wearing masks ah like you don't have to tegur
all the time like you see people right you don't have to tegur what because you don't know they don't realise that it's you you know
ya tak
ya tak perasan lah
bila nak snow eh
bila nak snow ah

so right now you still cari kerja lah
so right now you still cari kerja lah
oh okay lah uh right now pun I feel that
ramai orang yang tak ada kerja they can apply for this um
I pun ada apply I pun ada apply for other jobs but they also gave me the same reasonings like oh you are overqualified or you are underqualified
the macam for certain positions they will say macam um
tak ada hal panggil hal ah
right now pun aiya susah lah as long as I feel that kalau dapat kerja pun ambil jer lah eh
ya lah tengok condition dia lah you know some people they just
so kalau pay is not good
oh kerja apa tu
cause I applied for teaching macam english you know languages lah basically
ah macam tak faham ah I just
tapi ya ya papaya lah you know just
leceh lah it's just part of the routine right sekarang

tadi kalau kau pernah pergi kat one north kan kau akan terlihat seorang perempuan gempal tau kau pernah nampak tak
siapa eh mesti kau pernah nampak dia kirakan uh yang temperature screener dekat sebelah one north security kan
iya lah kat luar station tu lah so sekali hari aku dah pernah jumpa dia tapi dia ni pula kelakar ah cakap dari sini eh dia masih bersuami
ada anak dua tinggal dengan suami tapi dia ada matair lain kat luar matair dia pula dalam case kau faham jadi aku nak kenal-kenal dengan dia pun macam mana ni
suami lain matair lain abeh aku ni siapa ah cina buta jadi aku cakap ah tak payah lah aku korbankan sensasi bontot dia kan aku korbankan aku punya niat
aku tak nak teruskan tapi aku nak tegur dia dia takda aku rasa dia dah tak tahu entah resign ke apa tapi budaknya baik abeh aku rasa umur dia tiga puluh dua tahun
K kita punya segment macam segment segment apa segment rumah tangga pula eh kau ni jauh-jauh seh dari kau punya line
jadi sekali hari tu aku balik naik sampai ke choa chu kang lot one K hujan lebat aku ikut dia babe dari jauh sebab aku kirakan macam dah buang tebiat kan jadi
pada ketika tu aku nampak dia bawa barang banyak tau lepas tu dia belanja tu bulan puasa babe bulan puasa recently
dia nak balik dari dia punya lot one nak naik bus kan lepas tu aku nak ikut dia sekali aku aku tak dapat cari dia punya jejak lah dia hilang tanpa jejak
kemudian hilang jejak dia pun um the next day aku jumpa lagi aku ikut lagi ah this time aku beranikan diri aku approach dia tak silap aku that time oh okay
aku approach dia aku tanya nombor telefon dia ketika dia tengah temperature screening so aku rasa a few days later berapa hari yang lalu
the next day aku jumpa dia ah aku minta tanya dia lah nombor telefon dia lah eh
dia perasan aku bilang dia aku bilang apa yang terjadi lah aku bilang dia saya ikut awak gini gini beberapa hari yang lalu dia bodoh bodoh ingat aku ni macam psycho takde lah niat saya nak kawan-kawan jer takde apa-apa
so lepas tu aku tak kenal sangat pasal dia kita pun jumpa ah ajak keluar makan ah
keluar makan pastamania itu kira bila bulan puasa lah jadi aku tengok dia
so far okay ah tinggal dekat choa chu kang anak dua tapi dia kasih tahu aku status dia ah
so suami dia kirakan okay lah cakap cakap kira cakap pendek kirakan
bawa perempuan tu datang rumah kat atas katil dia kan dua dua terancang lah dia dapat tangkap she came back jadi
dia benar-benar rasa marah kan so aku tak tahu apa terjadi
tapi dia kata demi untuk anak-anak dia masih simpan perkahwinan dia tapi pada masa yang sama dia jumpa satu abang grab ni lah dia naik grab kan dia jumpa satu abang bawa grab ni kan abang tu pula pun kat dalam case nak ceraikan bini dia
jadi masing-masing mungkin dalam situasi yang sama jadi masing-masing pun kantoi mungkin uh masing-masing berpacaran ah for the past like seven eight months sebelum aku nak masuk dalam picture
tapi kalau aku kaji kembali aku lihat eh
aku rasa tak boleh kan sebab apa ni uh complicated kan betul tak
kalau aku nak jumpa dia sekali pun nanti aku pun rasa tak sedap eh kalau aku kalau aku ajak dia keluar ajak makan mungkin aku belikan dia barang ke apa ah kau rasa sesuai ke dia dia masih bekas bini orang
abeh lepas satu matair orang aku ni siapa cinta buta takkan tiga orang dengan satu takkan nak takkan nak gang bang pula tak boleh babe takkan tiga dengan satu boleh gang bang
tak boleh jadi aku rasa macam alamak tak kisah lah kasih dia lepas ah betul tak
aku dah stop jadi apa yang aku buat aku punya cara simple aku delete aku hilangkan padamkan nombor telefon beliau aku hilangkan aku ah buang segala
record record ataupun ah history eh
aku punya message message conversation dan juga eh so that's it so aku tak payah apa-apa ingat ingat lagi
so lepas tu dia pun tak message aku aku pun tak message dia jadi kita pun buat macam takde macam buat bodoh lah faham
aku dah lama tak contact dia jadi dah dekat dalam dua satu minggu lebih dua minggu jadi aku ingat dia masih kat sana tapi ni hari tak nampak
mungkin dia dah pergi tempat lain mungkin dah resign tau tapi kerja dia ni macam ada contract kau tahu macam dia datang kerja dia tu

aku bilang dia security course aku bilang dia lah dua belas jam tau you awak nak ambil security awak punya anak-anak macam mana aku bilang dia lah kan saya rasa lebih baik awak fikir dua tiga kali lah saya bilang sebab kalau awak kirakan awak dia suka buat event
ah so dia suka macam jual-jual barang kau tahu macam flea market dia suka macam organise tempat flea market jual barang she likes to organise things ah jadi pendek kata dia ni baik orangnya
cuma aku rasa tak payah lah aku teruskan niat aku kan sebab dia satu bini orang

telefon aku sorry eh itu siti eh saya nama saya manap saya ni suami nya si
perempuan ni lah eh
eh kau kenapa kau tak ada perempuan lain nak cari eh this thing akan terjadi tau kita tak tahu apa yes walaupun lelaki dia main tiga sekali pun tidak bermakna yang aku boleh kacau bini dia
sebab dia masih satu bini orang masih tinggal bersama lagi satu bumbung tau betul tak

ah betul tak itu aku punya cerita
iya lah sebab ni pun datang asal nafsu buat apa kalau kau nak jumpa seseorang tu apa sebabnya kau nak kenal perempuan tu agama dia ke kecantikan beliau ke
kerja beliau ke harta ke kau tahu aku pula dalam case nanti aku cakap dengan bini aku very simple aku berdoa kepada allah subhannallah wa taala kalau benar benar
bini orang isteri aku yang cina ni sanggup berubah untuk aku dia sanggup convert agama huh aku bersama dia lapan tahun berumahtangga tak ada anak dia bayar segala-gala untuk aku aku terus cakap dengan kau untuk pengetahuan kau lah kasih kau
aku tinggal dekat rumah dia dekat condominium kan kat telok kurau tu pun kan eh duduk semua dia bayar
duit rumah dia bayar duit tong sampah dia bayar even macam dulu aku bawa kereta kan sometimes lah bulanan punya deposit pun dia bayar tau kereta tau
dulu aku bawa kereta kan mitsubishi dengan aku bawa C class kan jadi dia banyak membantu aku dari segi kewangan dulu aku pernah ada loan dulu aku pernah
ah apa ni ambil loan sampai sini tau dulu-dulu lah dia bayarkan aku punya hutang dia banyak berkorban wang ringgit untuk aku
tapi aku terbuat silap aku terkenal-kenal aku aku terkenal kenalan dengan satu seorang aku aku bilang kau kan
yang perempuan tu yang celaka tu kan jadi aku bilang diri aku kenapa allah bagi aku ujian besar jadi aku bilang dia okay lah untuk aku menghilangkan segala-gala aku punya keperitan aku malam aku kerja aku lupakan si pinoy tu
aku ada harapan kan siapa tahu nanti next counselling session mungkin beliau dapat berikan aku peluang kedua aku tak tahu lah kan kalau itu terjadi aku akan berubah kau akan lihat aku tak macam sekarang
aku rasa sukar tapi aku tidak menafikan segalanya terserah kepada allah taala jadi kalau benar-benar terbuka hati dia tiba-tiba mungkin dia nak kasih aku peluang aku akan pastikan
ini benar-benar berlaku lah aku rasa sukar tapi pada masa sama walupun sukar aku dah buat keputusan kalau katakan lah aku ditakdirkan bercerai kali kedua okay aku akan bergelar duda
tua duda tua eh aku akan bergelarkan duda tua lah tak kisah lah tua ke pun tak kisah jadi aku bilang diri aku kalau aku dah duda tua tak ada duit lagi teruk jadi aku nak jadi duda tua tetapi ada duit kau faham
aku nak jadi orang berduit kirakan aku nak kena kerja kuat aku nak kena banyak berjimat cermat aku nak kena banyak cari kerja dapat kerja dapat allow tarik tau dapat kerja malam pun ambil dapat rezeki ambil simpan betul tak jadi kalau duit ni dah ada nak buat apa okay aku ada hutang kakak aku bayar sikit hutang kakak aku kasih sedekahkan mak bapak aku faham aku bagi apa kau faham keluarga aku dulu aku nak focuskan keluarga aku dulu
kita kerja ramai kawan betul tak kita dapat kawan jadi kalau kau perhatikan eh aku kadang-kadang suka message bebual sama yasir kau tahu kenapa tak yasir dengan aku pun sama dia pun tak ada bini tak ada matair kan yasir
jadi aku dengan yasir berbual pasal dia punya hidup jadi aku suka yasir dulu aku jumpa robert tapi robert dah buat hal kan sekarang dia buat hal sendiri robert aku rasa

kau tahu lah budak-budak muda sekarang kan dia tak peduli tau kalau kau dah ada anak bini tau
dia kalau sukakan kau ah dia punya cara simple tau okay lah kalau you suka I
you ceraikan bini you ah banyak macam gitu babe jadi
tahu tak apa dia orang tak peduli tau
ah kita punya masyarakat zaman sekarang very selfish mereka tak fikir ini semua
jadi kalau kau rasa yang kau engkau mesti ingat tau kau punya tujuan sana kerja
kalau ada situasi macam gini aku tahu ramai lelaki-lelaki kat luar sana yang akan
tak ada kan scandal dia orang lebih suka macam gitu tapi aku rasa kau orang baik kau jangan start ini semua lah tak baik kau tahu asal

itu lah cukup nak kasih dia piss off kau faham perempuan ni
bila dia orang nak bila cara untuk kau macam kasih mereka marah ataupun macam turn off kan
kau sebut nama perempuan lain mereka akan rasa turn off ataupun eh orang rumah kau itu tactic dia
ah jadi kau tanya aku kalau kau kalau kau takde sini macam mana bagi aku eh aku akan teruskan kerja sini macam biasa
aku tak boleh get attracted by your deparute kau tahu asal sebab kalau aku tinggalkan tempat ni kan
aku aku boleh bayankan cheng mun macam mana
he'll be under a lot of pressure faham
kau tahu lah li che tak suka dia
fiona pun tak suka dia aku rasa cheng mun pun mungkin tak suka dia roy pun tak suka dia ramai orang yang mungkin tak begitu suka dengan dia
pun macam gitu aku aniakan dia takkan babe sebab dia dah tolong aku
bila dia pilih aku terima aku bekerja walaupun aku melayu satu jer aku bilang diri aku
kenapa harus aku aniayakan dia aku nak kena support dia
that's why kalau satu hari tadi dia bilang mister see kan kau nampak kan kalau kalau kalau apek boleh tolong
aku akan beterima kasih sebab kirakan engkau pun support aku punya boss
chey syarikat seh kau cakap syarikat macam macam kat malaysia eh
dioye lah sini sini sini punya company ataupun iya lah syarikat untuk your right eh sini punya persatuan ah syarikat company semua ni kan
mereka punya cara satu mereka kalau boleh nak nak save cost ataupun nak kurankan perbelanjaan
dia orang nak kurangkan segala-galanya babe
mereka ada sikit macam apa tu favouritism memang dekat mana-mana semua ada
ah tapi bagi aku
tak ada sebab apa sebab sebab kita punya tu kan mereka dah cari orang tapi orang tu reject orang tu tak nak datang so bagi mereka aku dah buat aku punya kerja tetapi kalau
okay azri nice to meet you again so I just wanna say that kadang-kadang kita ni hidup
memang banyak dugaan life is full of challenges and of course what happens is like
jadi pendek kata kalau kita ni um
uh suka dengan kerja kita kita teruskan betul
kalau kita tak suka maybe dislike ataupun there's push like this then we have to
so in short K kita nak kena tahu
apa jua yang kita buat dalam dunia ini whatever we do here okay
ah jadi macam mana kau nak kekalkan kau punya ah
contohnya tadi aku bilang sama boss aku bilang sama you know aku bilangkan tadi kevin call aku kevin
so kevin came previously so if you saw right I put email dia I emailed him
dia punya request for this um to come down to check look at one eleven kan
was exhaust kau perasan eh so aku nak dia propose based on kita punya requirements apa dia punya exhaust fan size semua lah
so tomorrow he may come down around eleven thirty dia akan turun padang eleven thirty
kita bawa dia tengok tempat itu kan
then boss say kenapa aku cakap because when I try to activate rin cho
he can he macam ah always busy kau faham he got a lot of excuses right and then we he don't want to come then he cannot even give us the required proposals and quotations
so I told boss that I rather do not waste that kind of time and buang masa
tunggu contractor yang tak begitu focus
ataupun yang not really looking for all these things lah so aku bilang dengan boss
ah aku bilang boss ah aku bilang covalent so far is the only company
that have come a few times and then talk to azri and me about what they need kan kau ingat eh
ingat tak the earlier case about the issue at level nine of tower
dengar dengar dengar they are the only one eh that give the proposals for both the air issue and the and the motor you notice
they are the only one tau even Y&T tak kasih eh Y&T belum kasih
Y&T kasih yang dulu punya kau ingat ah Y&T kasih yang lama tu yang kita pernah reject alright
Y&T belum kasih tau ah abeh tu aku nampak ah kai long ada kasih motor oddly eh
air asia tak kasih lepas tu ah ray choo belum kasih abeh tu company C belum kasih
kau bayangkan tau of all kita punya contractor lima company
ini covalent one company can give us that two proposal tau and it's only company kau faham tak
kenapa wani tak nak kasih so it means aku nak kena gunakan dia orang punya specs
nak kena call lagi invite quote for the other company lah that's what aku nak kena bikin later
mana covalent
boleh ah kau tengok kau tengok proposal okay bagi aku okay not bad
dia propose bikin asia semua kan boleh
can be done ah so aku nak kena minta dia orang so whether they want to go or not itu masalah dia sekarang kita nak perlukan we need lagi dua quote betul
ah lagi dua quote kita perlukan lagi dua quote untuk aku bilang kau eh aku macam nak minta lye kasih kita quotation sia untuk aircon works kalau dia boleh bikin
lye boleh
lye lye lye lye ini tau takkan tak boleh
kau cakap orang ke melayu orang putih ni kau cakap orang putih ke melayu nama dia orang putih cakap betul-betul lah
bukan ah aku belum tanya dia lagi tapi aku rasa macam nak panggil dia orang sebab
aku tengok eh macam rin joo
dia kasih kita proposal kan dia rin joo belum kasih tau dia punya proposal I will write to him again
so far I've not really okay you see eh aku tak tahu what was the arrangement before my time
tetapi bagi aku aku still akan invite dia to quote for whatever that he needs to quote lah correct
sebab the idea was given by him correct pasal itu motor correct
so ini semua aku nak kena standby dia punya argument aku nak kena standby any email dapat nak kena tembak email sebab
every month care pax kita nak kena update alexis tau apa dia punya updates kau faham
takpe I will just send them another invite because I'm going to send invite to beberapa contractor jadi I want to see how is ah their
response and memastikan mereka boleh berikan peluang aku tak nak satu hari nanti mereka cakap oh aku penat-penat turun padang I came all the way down meet azri and rasyidi
I gave proposal tapi yang dapat kerja orang lain aku tak nak ini punya cerita
kita dah berbual selama empat puluh dua minit alhamdulillah jadi tak mengapa
okay back to eh kau tahu tak kenapa perempuan korea eh kenapa aku suka tengok zaman sekarang kan bila aku kerja ni kan kerja malam

ini tak kena mengena dengan kita tapi aku cakap nevermind kau just tengok kita punya issue you see our air issue
ah kita part kita dah maintain lah jadi tempat kau orang nak kena buat sesuatu so
we just let him know that what have been done and what required by the tenant ah faham
ah aware aware aware ya he will tell victoria meter punya cerita very simple as per fiona's permalas fiona said
this one install okay lah noted noted I not sure I'm here I'm only here six months I'm not sure so dia cakap
ah kata dia lah so okay lah so diam tak diam kirakan yang yang suruh rosakkan
so that is the arrangement lah so tomorrow si covenant turun
we have to focus on this O one eleven exhaust kau tahu pasal
ini benda eh we really need to get the quote soon because richard dah tanya orang pun dah tanya
because ini beruang punya madam F kau si xie
si gemuk tu kan dia nak handover bulan september tau
he wants she wants to handover in september like that kau faham
ah place ah so mereka dia ada plan yang
hebat lah untuk dapat tempat tu tapi
she got some requirement kau nampak there's some that you saw the email I know did you saw
top up dia punya cement twenty five add twenty five
lepas tu half of the probing
then number dua dia kata apa dia nak apa tu then they want to put the
nak letak gas outside lah then they want to puncture to our it is like good to have aesthetics
ah dia dia kirakan they want to do a lot of things okay but but whatever they do
to the centre of the place that is dia orang punya ah so called short floor lah correct
jadi ah twenty twenty five tau look
lepas tu dia orang kat atas ada big kitchen so that the other half eh all the way to the end of the unit is dia orang punya area ah
ah itu naik atas ah naik naik nak naik tu mesti naik punya
tapi kalau kau tak nampak tak obvious ah kan
depan depan the shop front front would not be affected yang belakang dia akan itu
ah they won't akan affect lah because behind they have to put some
ah frosted glass ke apa they have to do something to cover the behind ah
tapi dia orang ada intention nak letak itu gas cylinder itu sebelah kanan
the dia punya piping dia cat warna putih tembus kita punya ah cladding tau masuk dalam above ceiling
toilet eh dia orang kan most likely aku tengok dia orang akan convert sebagai store because dia kata dia tak nak dia punya staff gunakan toilet tu
okay lah I mean tu dia punya hak kan it's up to them
then they can dia orang boleh convert tempat itu untuk macam tempat simpan barang-barang lah
ah to me okay lah I mean as long as dia orang bikin
apa yang dia nak gini tapi so far aku rasa based on my understanding is like
ah cakap dengan fiona I told fiona as and as long as you tie your sprinkler
that is a requirement tapi kan he said masa tu cakap tak payah there is a waiver from then you must show us which clause ah
tak boleh dia mesti ada submission you must do a proper submission
yes I know dia bilang apa tau dia punya orang gas will do a submission

mereka nak kita buat sesuatu for the untuk mereka for their ah ladder
lye lye boleh bikin ataupun um
satu kedua dia kata they will get dia orang punya contractor to come and see the place lah apa-apa lah kan
they want to see but because they want to provide another alternative lah because initially mereka cakap apa

ah tu macam baru bagus

dan jangan cari musuh eh gitu mesti humble dan jangan buka kepak selalu babe
yang penting babe itu rambut kena warna hitam babe hitam eh rambut kena hitam jangan lupa
itu sahaja dua satu akhir alhamdulillah syukur stop
get a get a real job yes ha susah sia nak cari kerja sekarang
err I ya lah but I think it's the same right now right now it's the same for me uh pasal my wish is my need ah right now unless I really the the secure that that job then obviously I'm gonna change that wish ah to something else I tak tahu apa ah
dia orang cakap by in your first year it's gonna be an uphill climb err
it's gonna be I think we target one thousand in the first year one thousand you know oh my god I don't know how we gonna do it lah but ah I rasa dia punya
dia punya the struggle is gonna be real lah like the the views are gonna be super low I think the numbers are gonna be very discouraging unless kita hop on trends or unless
we have quality content lah but I think we have quality content eh I know the edits are gonna be super polished and all that stuff just that err getting people's eyeballs on it I think too I I rasa itu paling susah lah sia
I think you are confusing streaming dengan video kita memang buat video we are doing the highlights video the streaming part is just for the err console to record the whole the whole the whole session
so that's that's the entirety of the whole thing ah so streaming is just for recording purposes streaming is not for like people watch me play lah because I don't think people wanna do that yet kita kita not at that level lah nor we want to venture there pasal kita I think
streamers orang they are like deejays they are like radio deejays dia orang pandai berbual kita tak banyak berbual kita banyak inside jokes ah where we like to talk about among ourselves and all that stuff lah but I think the radio deejays job the streamer job is very difficult so ya you have to be a personality ah ya I think we have personality is just that I think we do better
so people will be interested lah I I I baca dekat dalam dekat youtube dia orang cakap if you want to start something like this ah you have to be you have to know what you are
uh like you are trying to focus on ah macam
macm kita kita nak kena main this specific game jer tau because what people want is people want
this content from you jer so you macam the speciality ah so ya macam they they look to you as a logistic person then they don't look for you as a macam a doctor advising sickness what that's not your speciality
they just look to you as logistics so same here for the the youtube thingy kita nak kena like specialise in this one game jer and then like a random kadang-kadang kita we see if we can selit one or two games inside
apa like cracking jokes or or winning it's a whole different ball game lah ya and then we have to come up with like content around that game different topics around that game I rasa challenging sia
tak ah of course not man
kita punya tak begitu sia I I make sure the content that we kita push out semua quality sia I mean it it should provoke a feeling lah and emotion for you hopefully there is like temporary happiness err like you kalau ketawa I think that's that's quite good already ah where we ini kerja keras like a no brainer you just tengok habis doesn't
you don't feel anything I think that's quite sad lah pasal kita edit susah payah kerja keras sia ni
oh the live stream one memang tak ada apa-apa like only live stream one is really moments lor the moments that are captured but that one once in a while ya very very hard to generate like content like that unless you plan
settle sia I dah belikan safwan dah
err I rasa like fifty err so ya I think fifty to hundred and fifty ya it was quite cheap
because kalau pergi yang kedai betul punya
but this one I got it for cheap lah like dekat Ali Express so that was good
so I think they have to like get the measurements right actually I also don't know whether they got the measurements right cause err I mean it fits ah I have no complains ah so I assume they the custom made it ah cause they they asked to put the measurement and I did measure myself ukur ukur ukur ya
got your help with that ah you ukur kepala ukur shoulder ukur my forearms
for the kids is just S M L I dah belikan safwan tengah on the way safi tak tahu kalau dia nak pakai ke tak maybe when he's older a bit
spider gwen ah okay okay ya tengok ah rezeki kalau ada lebih
I rasa nak pakai black cat lah no black cat is a spiderman version of cat woman but he's a black cat no
yes no I don't know I tak pernah where got spider spider cat is cat not a spider I say black cat I never say spider yes
I rasa nanti I minta cheese fries ah
tomorrow tomorrow dah call dah kalau tidak
take lah half day bila lagi nak ambil
next two weeks baru christmas
next week ada apa
ya is it bila you on leave right I thought you have long leave like
I accumulate dua puluh hari sia you
I selalu I selalu err selalu like fikir macam like last year punya tu I selalu tak nak habiskan I selalu simpan for the day that I want to leave the company
my plan is always to keep leave so I can macam ni I have to serve notice two months sia you now at least I clear leave I serve like
no lah from dulu sia I macam itu
I selalu tak nak habiskan if I can bring forward I will bring forward
there is no point in I don't know lah to me macam kalau kita tak kalau kita ambil leave to not go on holiday why would you want to take that leave
some more kita tengah work from home kan
bila dia hospitalised eh
because it's not dia tak tu ah dia nak kena kita punya sink kan dia punya bawah tu kan gemuk
IKEA punya is you remove that sink ada pipe theirs is for that pipe jer kita for the whole gemuk punya thingy
there is but it won't be err apa tu macam flush ah
the it's it's like a is a triangle so it's two triangles lah kalau you nak beli is two triangles but because it's not flush because that thing is gemuk dia it will protrude out lah so you won't be flush so you will be like ke depan ah
because kalau buat satu then the other one tak buat then the next time kena buat then is like err what buang masa but I think it's fast kan yang that time your father tukar jamban knock knock knock letak jamban baru macam cepat sia like in less less than a day dah habis sia ya that time remember ya lah he call somebody ah your err abang punya father
bawa panggil EX1>bangla<
pergi ketuk the jamban your old jamban inside your guest toilet the habis dia dia ketuk ketuk ketuk dia keluarkan jamban ambil jamban baru dia letak I was there I was watching ya probably you were at work but ya that was the whole thing that was like the whole jamban experience
no not for me I tak buat apa I don't know it was so dia seorang jer sia dia dengan ya your brother's father in law your brother father in law ya dia tengah perintah orang jer
perintah EX1>bangla< tu jer

orang kan adik adik tunjuk ibu kan gambar yang tadi kat corner itu ibu nampak
corner sini pun ibu boleh nampak I see a light like
different colour like ada macam
brown ada green
but you punya gambar
tak betul lah
who say dia gelap
no I said because inside dia punya
facebook dia ada taruh inside nasi dia kat dalam
so that dulang is I know is for four to six pax punya makan lah
so far tak ada yang untuk two pax
so actually I already ordered semua individual before that I already order all because I tengok tak ada
for dulang for two pax is always uh four and above
err macam not so nice like nak kasih uncle one packs two pack like macam
tak lah uncle dombang like kasih like one packet two packet like macam you know
uh apa
in a dulang
you look like macam apa pre pack your food macam ini you taruh dulang like cantik ah nampak ayam nampak semua ah
instead of that ah so that cakap possible not to do this dia cakap yes possible
so ibu cakap okay lah since dia cakap possible so I make a table lah put there
tray lah dulang in a in a dulang lah I cakap
dia cakap ya possible
so after that I send him the table to show that dia jangan salah lah
then okay they can put now dia pergi buat satu dulang
four daging
apa eh
I cakap hidup
if I known I cakap I won't ask you is it possible I ask you is it possible then you said ya ya can
itu that time kelmarin yang
we order takoyaki uh that day satu then after that we order yang nasi yang masa mika datang itu ibu order the tray satu
ayah satu buang lah but we actually ibu nak buang sekali ayah pergi cuci so ibu okay ayah sudah cuci put aside lah so ibu pakai that tray lah
so the rest pasal ibu ada tupperware besar sikit then okay lah put there lah ya
ibu purposely bikin table tau
uh ya lah like macam I I put there berapa eh
okay I put there bento mandi chicken
mutton masala okay that one's all correct memang one bento one packet
then three bento uh bento mandi chicken with add on kofta kebab
okay that one also correct ada tiga mandi chicken with
then I book one set mandi chicken uh buffet for five pax itu yang
dia bikin yang ibu cakap untuk kita kan dia cakap for five pax itu pun okay I he understood one set
then in the end dia kasih kat ibu
ya lah after that ibu call dia lah pasal bila sampai dia kasih ibu like packet dia ibu cakap macam tak nampak that round tray ada empat it's it's only satu but then I don't want to make a fuss I I ah cakap eh this one is only satu jer habis dia cakap ya lah ya lah I'm like just carry jer
just carry bring back itu lah then bila sampai rumah nenek ayah nak pack pack lah kat situ habis kat sana macam panas kan then ibu cakap no lah hantar rumah nenek satu then after that
kita pack pack
uh habis pergi rumah nenek then baru ibu buka ibu buka
satu jer that big round tray with itu habis
then I call her lah I say cakap you know when I say you put in my table I stated there four set what so by right must have four set lah why it's only one if not I just put one set right
otherwise ibu pun tanya dia it's possible because in your photo it's already show what is only five and above punya tak ada one pax for apa one round tray for two pax
entah lah jiu yang hari itu kasih habis after that
dia cakap okay lah habis dia cakap then how ah why like that I have to solve myself lah you ibu cakap
ask me how okay sorry lah this is miscommunication lah dia cakap
habis ibu cakap ya ya ya ya
tapi the night before I think before dia buat I think wednesday
can I just confirm that those bento change to dulang
is four bento of ayam and four bento of daging am I right
so masa itu ibu tengah tengok jadi ibu ibu cakap okay wassalam sis zus yes including four kebab so I think they misunderstood this
bila dia cakap salam can you just confirm yang those bento change to dulang
is four bento ayam and four bento of daging and rice so dia pergi taruh into one dulang
so maybe they refer balik to this
tapi dia tak pergi refer balik to the table then I cakap you look at the table table I put there four set
uh marah lah then
I brought actually I just inform err apa ibu bilang aunty bait jer yang okay no need to cook uh I'm giving you something to eat lah habis aunty bait cakap okay lah so the rest ibu tak bilang uh aunty lisha ibu bilang because ibu takut dia bawa siapa mika pergi swimming
jadi takut dia tak tahu jadi ibu cakap uh I'm sending apa
to you lah habis dia kata no need lah no need save money lah now COVID lah save money I cakap I pay already lah cakap dia cakap don't waste money like that I pay already lah oh you pay already uh uh okay
so I promise ibu sudah cakap aunty bait dengan aunty lisha saja so the rest ibu tak cakap then just imagine kalau semalam ibu sudah balik ibu balik dua belas setengah dua belas setengah balik sini uh pack pack pack sudah pukul berapa orang pun hungry nasib baik ibu tak bilang yang lain ada orang tunggu tunggu kata nak hantar lauk kat mana uh
tapi dia orang hungry macam mana
the one who make noise is ayah bukan ibu lah

sometime we plan but allah yang tentukan yang whether
of course we will nak macam gini tapi we plan but then if asal allah tak izinkan allah cakap no it cannot be planned as what you want I will change the plan so uh if you can like this lah
ah dia bila dia gitu dia diam lah nanti jap ya lah tapi

and err ya mostly barang macam
mee goreng combo
because it's near dia dekat dengan botanic garden ah
I always eat dekat Adam's Corner
cause you just need to uh naik bridge
and and you already reach it uh macam dalam five minute
if I go makan there I think
maggi goreng combo and the drinks I think

err bulan depan
apa-apa you cakap tadi ah
dalam masa depan pun I think will continue my studies
apa you join
tak tak tahu kenapa also I join then when I was sec three
my kawan uh all ajak me go
and that's where I grew my interest dengan rugby
I anggap rugby as a
whenever nak pergi training
so bila kaki tu injured
uh kena pergi doctor
so bila
time kecil tu my bicycle
tapi is not your normal bicycle is like
so daripada situ I pick up uh skateboarding also
so I play dengan skateboard together
tak ada break any bones because I want to continue playing
dengan skateboard and also maybe hopefully
kalau boleh lah um play rugby in another ten years
we live our life together sama-sama in dalam satu rumah happily
tapi I hope that phase three is coming soon because tak sabar nak pergi malaysia
tak mahu cakap pasal mask
then when you breathe and there's fog dekat cermin mata
I can't wear contact lens takut
my kawan like
I pun tak sabar nak uh habiskan ini COVID
ya sedih bila dengar Teo Heng is closing down
tapi um if it's not karaoke
I rasa I nak pergi main bola dengan my kawan
oh of course I want to keluar dengan my family
uh ajak dia orang pergi dinner um
you know uh pergi
tak pernah dengar pasal hundred dollar voucher
the hundred dollar voucher tu boleh buat untuk staycation
dah lama plan
ease off my mind off uh jauh dari rumah at least you know
meet somewhere that macam
uh boleh relax my mind
bila I go wild wild wet
kita pergi wild wild wet but actually it's different because
kena lineup time uh the lazy lazy pool
because they only limit ten people dekat dalam you only can go one round
boleh enjoy wild wild wet as per normal
cannot agaknya bring my girlfriend along
um actually tak pernah pergi sana but I hope to try
like just now bila
I cakap I don't like uh I mean I like heights right
I takut
bila dia tengah naik suddenly dia turun
tapi no matter how scary a roller coaster is right
ada ah similar
tapi tak boleh lah because it's illegal
I hope to go malaysia and nak cuba
there's satu specific
that I suka
it's a M three uh I tahu you don't like cars but
ya actually betul juga ah macam
tak tipu actually is one of my favourite
tokyo drift punya cerita uh in all the movies
kalau you percaya there's nine fast and furious movie
seven because after that I don't watch it anymore and it's it's not too realistic so macam dah malas nak tengok
ya macam for me
macam mana I boleh suka bola like
semenjak kecil uh
semua of my family
uh yes ada baby pictures of me wearing a
actually I suka club too because of the history
uh but it's datang from a rival club ah
after like how many years dia orang menang club uh cup
um I'm not being a hater tapi macam I'm glad that they won their first title after how many years
kalau tak nak pergi kerja you can always take tapi kalau dah ambil
uh pergi lah rest dekat rumah
hards hard time has to come first baru
easy life baru datang so don't expect everything to be easy
ya I get what you mean tapi
harap that everything will
and boleh dapat uh boleh dapat kerja senang
kalau boleh everybody at uh live their normal life after that
I hope that good news akan datang
kalau tak we will if orang tak uh
akan datang ah
oh it was so much fun after a long time I tak pergi kerja then went back so met um
um macam in a small group lah instead of last time one big group
group lah but no more number of days dia panjang ah um james was the in charge ah it's quite fun lah
screening right they are prepared awal you know I mean normal
kerja dari rumah more relax they says ah then they say oh then one of the guys is the reason why it's slow because I haven't open up my email
tadi tadi one is from um one's from mycrone
if nenek pekik-pekik
because I told bibik to give anxiety pill early
I think nenek is more on anxiety rather than depression ah because her anxiety is more on because her anxiety is more on
ah so I guess it's more anxiety than dari depression she depression is over already for her because those were the days when she like
two days a bit termenung thing of the past the sister who passed away already then the her husband then uh there is
and she started want to pray then she ah tak yakin that she pray and she wants to pray again and again so that is I think more of anxiety then if we stop her she became very angry
not um it's quite to say lah couple of days when she was at the peak um which is really really very I should say macam mana very tense you okay she was screaming and yelling at the top of her voice
her macam worse or ataupun dia punya um paling tinggi lah dia punya mengamuk atau dementia punya err
so as what you say lah maybe after this she's gonna be quiet and I could see like last two days already she's been like macam quite ah quite more peaceful um
um more macam if she she shouted yell and err
but not much and then err at night also she sleep even though she wake up every hour she's not screaming screaming ataupun nak minta keluar from the room instead she keep asking me what time is it then she keep saying that she wants to sleep when she ask me to sleep you know that kind of thing
ya compared to the first I don't know whether it's it's a good sign or a bad sign but I anyway just redha jer lah ikhlas and redha
the one thing about her she's always afraid to be alone itu sahaja um from last time she doesn't want to be alone
hantu are not human
she's very garang human but she's scared of all those
ghost or those apparently normal thing lah she's very scared the rest I don't think so lah macam people she's not afraid of lah none of anybody even I think prime minister also she can shout at
of course lah unless she says like stupid things lah then she says I want to go back why you bring me here loans lah merepek jer accounting but cute lah she answer
apa ni merepek nak balik ah which is funny lah
macam gitu lah
what's your name how many children you have lepas tu dia tanya
all the personal things lah then tanya
um past then present then tanya in between so
the cheat one of continue at first we broke break it up lah so she macam ada rest and then after that continue again um
ya but the progression is like um the progression is actually macam okay lah people
um which macam mana nak cakap eh ah depression lah maybe lah
difficult for me to say lah because it involved brain and then like nenek they said that some of her brains already stroke
educate the caregiver itu lah
because dia orang ni sooner or later they going to be
she confused what to do then she just stare at the wall then say ah eh I thought you want to err pass motion or you want to kencing and then after that she looked at me then he or she doesn't even know that um
um professional ataupun ah
nurses yang
well educate about all this macam well prepared or they are teach to handle another human with mental illness or is it good that the children or the family themselves take care of them
which is err no the better lah no way I'm quite difficult lah this this this this dementia or old aging punya err problem eh it's going to hit the world
the youngsters educate the youngsters ataupun macam make it a point that
or anak mesti nak kena jaga parents atau there is this centre ataupun help from the government from the nurses from the healthcare is going to be a challenging one I tell you
kita kena ada this mindset that you know this mindset after when when I go through taking care of minute which is having dementia you know on the went through then I come to realise that
eh tak baik say dia tak nak jaga mak bapa dia tak baik say tak nak jaga mak bapa dia
sending your parents to a nursing home is not a thing that macam kita nak abandon them it's like you putting them into a nowadays when you got a child
you have to work and then putting a child to childcare centre is last time people will say eh tak baik mak dia tak nak jaga anak dia dia letak
the same mindset that is going to happen for old folks so I think in europe they find that ataupun european europe country atau the america they find that sending the
dalam islam okay kita kita sebenarnya dalam islam pun memang kita nak kena berbakti pada orang tua tapi islam tidak tidak meletakkan a must
kind of macam err educate ataupun information or awareness given to all these children are about how to manage your parents when they are old and sick you know and specially when they are having dementia
macam preparation for the future for the future or
I think so because but mm but I don't think so they take nowadays they dia orang macam tak encouraged but they are
they have this macam mana nak cakap eh dia tak encourage tapi dia dah dah ready
I did in this ah they call it the studio apartment kind of thing where okay you dah tua you tak nak tinggal dengan anak you buy this house which is like thirty year you must be the age of sixty then you can buy and then the house must
be in the centre of a um estate where a lot of amenities macam vast or or supermarket doctors dekat dekat and then err the whole building dia orang pun ada macam err
how should I say macam dia orang ada
clubhouse lah something like that for these old folks to come down to do some are ya ya senior activity centre I should say ya but dia orang tak macam
macam apa eh
have campaign ataupun macam kasih
tahu dengan public no they just do it you want it
okay this uh we have it you know tapi dia tak ada encouragement ataupun dia kasih macam I find lah macam tak banyak orang tahu pasal ni not many people that that not many people it was once me I don't even know
an idea ataupun dia come up with a they come up with a with an a project or ideas or system mah
they don't they they say said very err how should I say uh tak macam besar tau like very big macam siapa tahu tahu lah siapa tak tahu tak tahu lah that kind of thing
so it's kind of like macam siapa yang pandai tahu ambil tahu
then they are they are well informed otherwise takde takde orang tahu tak tak macam orang be bothered takde orang tahu lah um that's the problem lah
kita tak macam based we are free religious
other activity macam ah more of entertainment entertainment and activity lah you know of ataupun
old folk citizen soon or not far also but err right now people at my age I should say ataupun people at pak age those who were born or in the fifties and sixties you know we ask if you supposed to now start
atau plan then talk to your children what do you want when you are
at this stage and at this stage so both ada compromise both boleh plan sama-sama and both also boleh you know financially prepared you know that kind of thing
macam dah tak boleh seorang ataupun I have to depend on people okay when I have to depend on people
oh what what people who I want to or is it my children is it a helper or I want or other people you know that kind of thing so must sit down and tell my children okay let's say I want to be by myself I want to be independent but if I have the dah tak boleh juga
I kena orang then I know I don't want to burden my children um
kau orang share cari orang jaga mak that kind of thing but make sure and please make sure that everyday ah one of my children must visit me ah macam gitu lah
ah ataupun nanti cuti come and visit me to take turns are not to go over to their house a macam sekarang ni eh banyak karang ni I see like macam my girlfriends
are people that I know ah they have mom which go every week go to every are of err anak-anak punya rumah macam anak dia ni satu minggu anak dia tu satu minggu I I don't know whether is it a good idea because mak dia boleh tukar-tukar angin tapi kalau mak dia nak tukar-tukar angin is it
oh at this stage eh dia dah penat dah lemah dah sakit is it good for her to change
the second option is so much better because dia tak ada burden others because you see ah
anak-anak kadang-kadang anak nak jaga betul ah children wants to but you must also remember anak-anak not the spouse ada anak I know and then a spouse also have their own
things to do and then um anak-anak dia orang pun ada pun nak dia orang punya
peace also it's like um mak ni macam jadi macam you know instead of become a responsibility to them it become burden you faham tak
unless you macam okay let's see lah this is
ah what I think it's good it's like macam let's say I ada empat anak I ada dua belas cucu something like that dua belas cucu enam yang very um macam dah secondary school ataupun dah pergi tertiary you know which they can help
you know so empat plus enam sepuluh sepuluh ni take turn lah take turns to um go to grandma house to this err monday to this day I'll be staying with grandma for the whole day you know okay then err this day to this day okay mak pula yang kena tinggal sana
ah macam take care out dia orang ada ni eh ada helpers twenty four seven dekat dalam rumah tapi err macam make sure stay duduk makan tengokkan dia the whole time they that's that is the way I want it to be lah
rather than err kena hantar pergi rumah satu anak ke satu anak sini anak sana anak sana sana sana habis I rasa macam gitu lagi better lah emak yang in one place everybody come take turns come and visit
monday and thursday my turn okay dia ni wednesday and friday dia ni so the more people into that into that program the lesser that you
other elderly parents so um I'm I think I'm the only one who has mother with me and are in mak nenek into one station the rest all have to rotate lor whether dementia ke tak dementia ke pun rotate
oh maybe macam cik rosnah lah cik rosnah punya mak lah dia kan macam tu satu place when maid with with the helper than everybody come cik rosnah come everyday to bathe her
and then the rest come in and then err also so cute then they have this like macam caregiver punya holiday they wait and caregiver can go for holiday and then anak-anak lain have to sit take care
um so macam gitu lah macam pada mak lah better mak that way lor I don't know
lah you got a point there also lah it's what you say tapi kalau sebelum dia orang could are given a task kita kena educate lah the main thing here the the the role model is very important
want your child to be you have to do it first to show it to them macam kita tak boleh
um macam alamak this week I cannot lah I have to look after my mother you know that kind of thing we have to go eh I can't and I have to look to my mom it's been
it's my turn I don't want to waste you know I don't want to um macam kita kena tunjuk positif that kita kena tunjuk yang kita kita look forward you know taking care of parents and then making an appointment oh I can't
ya true sebab masa tu nenek okay
but sekarang ni
tak boleh lah sekarang nenek have one person to take care of her must be two person just now I just told
put their mother with the maid and then they have to work and then they come back they already tired and then they have to go for their other thing so the maid is with the mother twenty four seven if the the maid is kuat takpe that is why there is a lot of cases that maid abuse of old folks because of this
you know dia orang tak nak jaga tak nak mandikan dia orang pukul because dia orang sendiri tak boleh tahan
you know kita dua orang pun dah tahu macam mana okay this one down the other one come up to console and this one okay okay you rest I take care because this one nak cuba cuba calm her down she doesn't want you start screaming yelling and cursing
siapa yang tak marah even though we know that she doesn't mean it but the negative and harsh word was thrown to us it's very painful
party must come out kalau seorang seorang macam mana itu pasal ada banyak yang marah ikat nenek dia orang ataupun ah ikat orang tua um macam pukul sebab kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak mandi kadang-kadang tak nak makan ataupun dia orang buang-buang barang
you know that kind of the the truth they become abuse did the abuse the maid itu yang buat
um banyak terjadi didn't know I beginning to understand why people have to go through
this lah because nenek is actually educating me you know
then what do I want in my future that kind of thing so prepared you know they're gonna macam sakit ke macam um
bila marah ke apa ke kena buat banyak lah banyak lah kalau lah sekarang baru tahu mana orang yang marah mak dia kalau dah tak boleh tahan um
punya punya apa mental mental punya
our readiness oh mesti nak kuat
ya really last time I people always says ah tak apa jaga orang tua nanti dapat syurga jaga orang tua then when I started to be angry with my mum and then I started to raise my voice at her or at a certain point of time I'm very very mad at her or I geram sangat ke then what is syurga
macam tu I can't even reach syurga if I do this to my mum
I take care of her not because I want syurga I take care of her because it's my responsibility
it is my duty to take care of her and I've been chosen this is my duty that I have to take care of her that is the one which I tell myself I have confidence if I want to scold her if I want to be angry at her if I don't want to macam
I she's get she got annoyed her you know ataupun you know I tak boleh tahan dengan dia then I don't feel guilty I am human and then when I do this to her I don't expect reward
ah ya that's why I said because I cakap I dapat awareness ah so it's something that macam god is given me awareness oh okay this is what you need to do lah that I need I can plan compared
ah twenty four seven take care of punya
orang tua and then they they they now I have ah ah macam my siblings they started to see themselves being old and then being in a not being independent anymore they started to be panic who's gonna take care of them
and then they they by hard atau by force they says my children have to take care of me I don't care already take care of them
which is I think not right we are human and we we we have to macam mana nak cakap eh a process of being young and then adult and then old
is everybody have to go through tak semestinya aku beranak kau kau kena take care of me somebody else can take care of me right not ah tu lah kadang bila mak fikir
err macam knowledge macam pergi macam I pergi universiti lepas tu I graduate you know I'm graduated where where I in his life experience that I have to go through no if if I were to given a chance to give um macam
a talk atau macam kasih volunteer atau told people or need help atau need advice I think I have
ya lah you mean a even a person who study how to handle the situation also breakdown because it's like a handling okay is like a technician and a caregiver is a two different thing ah technician go machine you know macam mana machine
but human handling the human is not it is not like handling a machine human they have the they are so complex especially emotion dia orang emotional dia orang is so complex that we
don't know ah macam mana professional you are a good ah
it you'd secretaries apa ke all of them based on experience or dia orang punya client punya patients punya experience and then they bring forward to another patient you know
but another one human to another human is always there is a different is never the same this this human you study okay this human study because their the way they scream okay the scream because dia tak dapat
dia tak dapat apa yang dia nak okay I can apply to another another human this woman scream okay okay kita kasih penat tapi tetap keep on scream bukan itu dia tak suka ah dia scream sebab sakit perut you know that kind of thing so it's a two different
human being dia macam twins lah twins muka sama everything sama tapi tetap perangai lain
her likes and dislikes you know the err for the professional we bring it to the they I just uh based on their life experience based on their theory based on their finding their event dia orang punya
err other patient that they see they try to apply right or not so professional pun mesti ada family members pun mesti ada and then um very important lah
oh so it's not easy it's not easy so it's like at home me and the helpers are also in the macam
ah apa they call it err
makan ya
ah nevermind just like grandma lah tak tahu macam mana nak bilang actually she wants to go toilet instead she just say in the middle of night instead of saying she want to got to toilet she say nak keluar tak boleh tidur
you know she said ah mak tak boleh tidur mak nak keluar pukul berapa and then when we stopped her from going out the she said mak nak kencing
there's a oh sebenarnya nak kencing eh ah then we brought her to the toilet we brought her to the toilet then we pushed her we say okay now it's time for you to sleep okay after kencing you tidur okay and then she say okay then she sleep peacefully
err so sometimes kat dalam bilik pun sama and actually she don't like be stuck in confined place atau bilik is too cold or too hot she wants to go out and sleep outside so instead of saying that
oh bilik dia sejuk lah kadang-kadang ataupun mak tak nak tidur kat luar she keep on saying nak keluar nak keluar tolong tolong nak keluar nak keluar then we keep asking why nak keluar then that makes her so angry that why can't you just sleep the place is so comfortable
for her it's not comfortable for us it's comfortable for her it's like it's so confined no one but she doesn't know how to tell us ah only if she could tell mak nak keluar because ah bilik ni gelap lah bilik ni sejuk ah okay kita tidur kat luar that will be much
true communication is just like you when small kid cry and cry like babies cry baby cry we will say stomach pain or pampers dia dah penuh um
susu dia nak minum ni ataupun dia ada some ah
crack ataupun ulcer ataupun sakit perut I don't know that kind of thing so it's like a process ah cuma baby it get get baby kita kita jaga macam dia punya journey is to be independent ah kalau old folks kita jaga needed is to be dependent
ah volunteer next week lah dia start tak tahu lah apa dia buat but ah like I told you lah we we started with the orientation online because sekarang we are still in the phase
copyright copyrighting untuk uh tak tahu apa lah dia punya social media punya page lah
tak pergi mana-mana lah this is online because right now we are still in phase two um so we had the orientation online and we can only meet
as as as a as a cancer as cancer society punya volunteer we can only meet when it's phase three because has strict guidelines sekarang uh because people you know cannot meet
tak tahu ah all these blah blah things so ya we had orientation online sedih engkau kau tengok
can do lah macam so I want to do the copyrighting
and then you know the like translation you can do things for macam design uh photography
uh they have macam a knitting crochet with the patients but sekarang takde lah pasal you know it's it's uh only phase two and then they have they do a lot of things ah cancer society they've been around for a long time jadi so they they're very established in the community
is to make you know singapore cancer free really I mean that that's obviously susah
um but they tried uh I think one of the biggest things that they do on a on a yearly basis is uh the apa tu nama dia awareness uh campaigns so they go out in the community and then they have these macam cakap cakap pasal
uh ramai orang macam takut nak buat cancer screening because of course takut lah macam people takut nak buat cancer screening
which in the population in singapore of like five point something million is not a lot lah ya so macam gitu lah ya I'm looking
forward to it lah honestly something I've been wanting to do for a macam dah lama gitu so uh ya inshaallah I'll be able to do quite a lot from next year
no next week they will give me the um they have something in mind I think uh ya and then macam I'll just
tengok lah kalau kalau boleh tolong then I'll do it because you know we're volunteers we're not like new workers
uh but of course they ask that eh no kalau once you commit you have to do it ah bukan macam suka-suka macam this week buat next week tak nak buat ya
you know next year when they start doing uh the actual work that they do I think the first thing chinese new year bila
okay so what they do is on the form in uh apa apa tu during the four main religious group punya holidays so chinese new year is the first one so they do christmas chinese new year
hari raya dengan like deepavali
I think now dia tak buat apa-apa lah this year they cannot do anything but what happens is for these main events they have uh all volunteers come together and kita macam pack pack goodie bags gifts and for chinese new year they have ang pao
so a lot of families you know cannot as it is macam tak boleh afford treatment and then balik rumah rumah macam gitu and then cannot afford to buy food
food they can't afford cab fare to go back and forth so cancer society gives them um like grants and and you know money like contributions uh so the low income families can afford it so for chinese new year they do this but normally they said for chinese new year orang datang like people have to come to them to collect the ang pao um but this may be depending on uh whether or not phase three starts next year lah um I don't know whether that's going to happen ke tak ya so that's next year
kalau tidak boring aje kan buat remotely I'm not going to do just copyrighting
ya why not kenapa tak boleh
oh ya that's one of the things you do when you go to the homes the uh programs where volunteers kemaskan rumah cucikan rumah tau
ya I mean there's lots there's lots that you can do as a volunteer the I mean macam banyak macam program program lah you know there's a lot to do so one of the things ya um ya so they they do cleaning for the patient's homes because a lot of times especially the lower income families
they the caregivers go with the patients to do the treatment and then balik they are both
too penat uh the but um macam especially the patient to do anything else so the cancer society sends in volunteers to go to the house
kemaskan rumah they showed like one house macam eh kesian lah I tengokkan like it's quite sad like you know because they really don't first of all they don't have the money to
you know a lot of donations for food and stuff so you know just makanan bawa pergi rumah dia
and stuff like that lah so it's a lot of things that are happening for them and I think that that's why they regularly have macam apa tu volunteer drive so this was the latest volunteer drive and I signed up for it
a'ah macam gitu
because you're not I mean you're not you're not like it's not like you're signing a contract untuk apa kan and it's really up to you
but buat apa ni
but but wait the dogs dari mana
the dogs kat mana
the one dekat
tengah oh ah dekat ya that's true
ini because of the uh apa ni benda ni ah
even with the ini the dogs and the cats
like dog walker pun tak boleh
ambassador ni untuk apa
untuk for like companies lah
ambil gambar apa oh okay
so the fosterers untuk anjing-anjing kucing-kucing like is it is it only untuk the dogs or untuk kucing-kucing also
so when you say volunteer with doing this maknanya you take on the volunteer work with the money as well
like in the in the sense that you bayar untuk semua bende ni semua
so who pays for punya clinic like they have this clinic and they are themselves they are themselves a charity so they have
wow that must cost a lot of money I mean but but now that you said that they have their own clinic clinic must mean that they must be doing okay to set it up macam sekarang dah macam
ada lah duit sikit gitu lah
G O V ni apa
what is the nama oh okay
iya lah charity lah I mean they don't expect the government nak kasih semua orang duit mana ada duit government gets the money dari kita taxpayers as well
sorry the priority number one priority is to the orang-orang
apa masalah if you if the government don't have enough money to macam apa tu cakap
to give macam to give enough so that the citizens are okay then you know the priority has to be us the citizens instead of kasih anjing-anjing
apa punya development
mana kita ada jungle what we don't have any jungle
but do you all know you know as volunteers of uh and working in this working in this uh apa tu dia sector does the government actually have a plan uh when when macam like they go now kat belakang ni like there's this
tengah tengah this new development kat tengah kat belakang sini
do you know do these groups which are know if the government has a macam apa tu cakap
bukan contingency lah tapi macam plan lah like a plan when they develop these new lands
but they've been developing singapore for how long takkan lah macam sampai sekarang tak tahu
mm pasir ris pun ada babi
but how can it be macam gini like because it has been going on for so long it's not as if macam kita baru start nak develop lands or takeover lands it's been macam we've been we've been building
and and other housing since bila kita punya independence nineteen sixties ah
so that's only the dogs because I know dekat pasir ris when I went uh pasir park ya I saw the wild boar was right there in front of me behind the fence
ya because recently kan ada perempuan tu yang kena attack tu
eh kau punya kerusi ni gatal seh
gatal lor
ya but I'm okay I always sit there I'm okay jangan duduk situ
kesian spoke but so what what happens so who
uh tapi it's been there for awhile dengan macam
terus kasih lah I always said that
tapi so when you
okay so I understand because I can see all the apa anjing-anjing kan I can see
and the uh siapa nama tu
who takes care who is supposed to because kat sini I've seen satu just one snake and
apa ACRES
he's a syrian refugee dia tinggal dekat lebanon
so this was his part of his second exhibit and I really really loved it anyways ah cakap macam gitu
so no honestly uh apa cakap ular-ular
it's not as easy as oh nampak anjing oh uh nampak babi we can see it we can you know some kind of action the ular ni you know macam kat bawah-bawah and then in the longkang-longkang you never know and then the fear is until they come up through the drains which has happened of course before but eh takut
uh snakes because I mean we we don't often hear about uh ular macam ular coming out there are not as many sightings as dogs and and the wild boars especially so
are there I mean I've only seen satu kat sini
and and then dia macam masuk dalam longkang and then it just like slithered away but it was enough for me to macam takut uh because I can't I betul betul there's one thing I cannot do is reptiles and and snakes and like big lizards tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh so
so the thing is dekat here in in where where I am where I live sometimes I do see the um the stray dogs there is a family of three kadang-kadang macam during the day I can see them they like to sleep under the vans
one auntie dia um auntie tinggal kat tak tahu block mana she comes around to feed the cats so she was telling me the other day that uh dulu dia kena saman because she fed the dogs
so I don't I don't know anything about macam people feeding uh stray cats or stray dogs but auntie ni sometimes I give her some money because she buys a lot of food untuk she feeds a lot of stray cats macam she brings macam besar you know macam orang-orang macam ini um
ya so she was telling me so she doesn't she doesn't do the dogs anymore because she's afraid of getting um for dia dia cakap dia kena
kena saman so I don't know I don't know how true that is ya
tak tahu lah auntie I don't know I mean I'm not going to go check after her the problem is auntie sekarang pun nak kena she has to be careful because she also puts out uh
air untuk kucing-kucing ni so the problem is our area kat sini is a high dengue area
what do you mean two hours to clear siapa yang pergi check
siapa yang nak catch
what do you mean walk past lepas tu kena fine tak boleh feed but you can feed right
I don't understand this this this two hours ni
how do they know macam who keeps tabs on these two hours thing
um tapi kau duduk situ so you have to like sit there and watch the cat eat until it's finished
mesti clear lah
tapi dia the feeder mesti clear makanan tu
ah because then you attract all the all the like cockroaches and a'ah betul ya that's true
lepas tu kalau kena tangkap saman dia how much is the saman
takde lah mana ada kat sini signs
ya but the the cats kat sini bagus juga lah and honestly the cats around here gemuk-gemuk because of macam auntie macam gini and this
eh apa kat belakang ni there are couple of cats who always come around and they they get fed more than one person
about the same kat sini so every morning when I this my my block when when when I when I wake up to to and I go to the you know the bathroom peep there are
six six-ish in the morning I hear sausage who is the neighbourhood cat who is so cute nama dia sausage aku kasih nama jer lah so I I sausage comes and I can hear sausage meowing because I'm on the third floor I can hear sausage meowing from the downstairs
sampai uh auntie kat bawah ni you know I can hear the auntie coming out and feeding him that's sausage
and then as the day goes on when I like look out the window um I can see someone else coming there's another man kat dia tinggal kat I think like behind this block
he comes and he feeds sausage again sausage ni honestly I've never seen stray cats
I mean uh macam the the
size tu macam comparable to a domestic cat like a cat punya kat kat rumah orang ya ya a pet cat
so you know they were they were they're they're well taken care of kat sini I always see the same cats around here so you know that people that they feel safe
have run away dulu we used to see more of the dogs
uh during the day especially during the circuit breaker this is what I notice I first saw them during the circuit breaker ya because takde orang keluar kan
so I saw them dia selalu tidur under the this lorry because orang pun tak kerja so they were like always sleeping the three of them
so I don't know what happened to them ya ya so during circuit breaker when there were a lot of animals not just the kucing but the aunties still came around to feed the cats that one betul I always see that
the birds the birds now I don't hear them anymore uh anjing tak dah takde lagi
ya it was a good period when we had the circuit breaker because there were lots of birds that every morning I could hear them it was nice we had kat depan ni right in front here there's these two big palm trees kan so
the imperial pied pigeon came during the circuit breaker which is not a common sighting in this neighbourhood macam this um once or twice we've seen them along the macam apa tu the park connector here at bukit batok going up to clementi but they came here the whole there were like there first of all dia hantar satu agaknya macam scout came scout nampak pokok ni scout stayed there so I took gambar lah dengan camera tu and then the next week few more came
yes because they eat the apa ni I don't know what the fruit is of this thing the family came imperial pied piegon it was really nice here ya I have pictures of them
ya but it's this tree yes but for them to fly all the way here is another method now that there are there's more traffic they like the quiet places so now they're back in when I was dekat apa jalan dekat park connector tu I can see them back at the park connector because there's no traffic is right next to big longkang
they are so you see kat sana ada the egrets so again during the circuit breaker when you know the only thing you can do is keluar pergi
jalan you know everybody suddenly everybody pergi uh exercise so in that apa tu nama dia longkang the otters all came out so the otters the egrets
the animals crossing the path tak ada lagi during circuit breaker you could see different kinds of animals
uh but it was nice it was nice because at then even then the otters came out and everybody would stop um and they would do their swimming swimming but tu macam exhibitionist tau the otters are huge exhibitionists
okay we don't get those kinds of otters in the in the longkang where did they go to the uh the botanic garden
so they came out macam every night
tak tahu lah
but they're not the ones yang kat dalam longkang ni they're not that big dekat sini kat park connector the one that goes up to pandan
jangan bedek lah kau cakap different family different types lah
what do you mean mana ada clan
macam apa clan
eh kau jangan tipu lah macam mana boleh gini
eh kau macam eh kau jangan bedek lah I mean sorry this is not
like on the ground macam they go and macam nak nak pergi cari
ah okay like like the people who go sungei buloh cari burung cari burung ah okay okay okay
but they all look the same apa macam mana nak ada divide
so the one yang that I say kat sini
during the circuit breaker kan so I read about the one yang
so do they macam pindah from one place to another or when you say dia orang macam this otter clan kallang clan do they just live there atau macam
they come kat sini to look for the
bukit batok clan what what I honestly don't understand macam mana ni
lepas tu kalau dah nak kahwin macam mana of course you have to look for orang lain kan
lepas tu sekarang macam mana where do they go now like I've haven't seen them in a while
so macam do you think they like live there in in the botanic gardens that kind of and and dia orang macam what what I don't understand about okay in this case is the otters
macam during the circuit breaker macam okay so that one whole family keluar pergi serangoon road nak pergi cari apa tak tahu apa eh when is it that they know they can they can go somewhere else like at do they go at night
like right now the clan from botanic gardens I because I find it hard to believe that that they just macam duduk kat situ aje
so in snakes I snakes I understand snakes you slither I've seen the snakes kat sini in the drain
how did the otters from macam botanic gardens pergi
kat sini like bukit batok because there is a whole we we see a lot in bukit batok at the park connector in the longkang
like do they get tagged by apanya nama dia ACRES
two thousand so we did not hear about otters in singapore because and then when I came back here for a break like about two years ago then I people were talking about macam on social media pun tengok gambar-gambar orang tunjuk all the otters knew there was once kat clementi uh near sixth avenue that big longkang
and I was walking past then I actually saw the otters in the apa longkang besar
um but I don't understand like when I left singapore in two thousand and three did we have otters then or is it macam a new development that they came from somewhere
eh kau jangan bawa telephone kau masuk toilet boleh nanti orang dengar
kau can you please not macam gini this lucah can you please close the door
so ya that's what I'm saying because dulu I mean growing up here we did not hear about otters
ya lah wildlife ya lah of course aware but takkan lah what I'm saying is takkan lah dulu honestly I mean I grew up in kampung we did not hear about all these otters during kampung dulu kampung banyak benda of course we had the monyet we actually had the monyet uh then
but we I don't know about I don't even have that kind of memory growing up in kampung but we had the big longkang-longkang
so takkan lah I mean couldn't have been that they
how did they come about to be in the macam the public's consciousness
so these otters do they get tagged do they get tagged macam apa tu namanya microchipped
do they no I mean when you say they care for them bukan macam it's it's not like what you guys not like what you guys do at macam you can't walk the otter
in singapore do they have them macam untuk ular-ular
because I mean we have a lot of snakes in singapore kan I mean we just don't see them because they are really good at macam just hiding away and going into the longkang
but how do you macam if if you say like the last time I walking to westmall then I saw this snake it just goes into the longkang then it just disappears
oh I I remember dulu dekat the the kat mana tu I don't know what lah it was in the news was it a python
so what happens when ACRES comes when apa the the snake now it has the
kucing the kucing is in the perut
but they have to catch it and release it somewhere else kan tak kan macam redhill kat bawah block tak kan you you can't just leave it there
kalau gelak-gelak continue ini lah
okay akak lah share dulu
sixty percent banyak juga itu sixty percent
mm mm ini sebab semua orang dekat rumah kan
rasanya eh bukan
sudahnya sudah tak ingat tapi kalau biasa kalau sebut goal untuk setiap tahun kan
tak lah masih hiburan macam tahun-tahun lepas tak berjaya
maintain a'ah tapi
ya lah sebab kan ada masalah spine so
macam mana pun kena turunkan berat badan tapi itu lah masalah sampai sekarang tak boleh turun-turun
a'ah so itu tak tercapai lah kan
kalau segi err financial tercapai lah
sebab target dua puluh dua puluh nak simpan err lima belas K
lepas itu dari segi kerja kan nak kerja
maksudnya yang kerja yang kerja baru lah kan environment semua
dapat lah sebab sekarang sudah kerja dengan
walaupun untuk masa sekarang contract kan tapi at least sudah bertukar lah
something new lah okay dari segi
err ibadat pun rasa macam teruk banding dengan dulu kan dulu kan waktu student kan dia macam
affect result lah macam tak tapi sekarang macam makin teruk kan padahal makin tua makin ingat tuhan kan tapi
mm ya lah banyak doa doa nak rebut jodoh jer asyik jodoh jer kan tapi
ya lah benda itu tak seiring dengan yang sepatutnya ah itu
macam nak kahwin lah nak kahwin
tapi tak tak ada rezeki untuk kahwin so kita bawa kepada tahun ini lah dua puluh dua puluh satu lagi apa ah
um dari segi apa lagi ah dari segi
hubungan dengan keluarga tu makin rapat sikit lah sebab
err since kan memang ada dekat rumah
so memang kita orang kita orang satu family semua dekat-dekat
maksudnya kita orang banyak masa bersama macam itu lah
sebab sebelum ini memang ida daripada metrik memang jauh daripada family ida saja yang jauh
a'ah so sekarang macam oh banyak lah masa dengan dia orang so macam lebih memahami lah lebih lebih menerima
itu bukan dia pasal dua puluh dua puluh satu eh
decision yang membawa kepada itu
mm tak cukup sepuluh ini
oh macam ida cakap tadi ah dari segi financial ah itu memang kita sudah nampak kan memang
hundred percent achieve kan lepas tu yang kedua oh satu lagi ida
dengan business ah
err a'ah dengan business err lagi satu
err dua puluh dua puluh
err apa ini tahun yang sangat menguntungkan lah ida bagi ida dalam bidang Shaklee sebab
monthly ida dapat maintain income empat angka
ah macam seribu minimum seribu tiga ah
macam itu sebab kita kat rumah kan eh so kita banyak masa dengan phone so kita nak focus ah dengan business online
so apa lagi ah achieved a'ah lepas itu
mm dapat kerja macam cakap saya tadi apa lagi ah
mm okay dapat publish dua paper
okay empat
a'ah empat lepas itu um
lagi ah
apa lagi ah ya allah teruk ah
okay oh saya
oh sebab ida pun terkejut macam wah banyaknya
ida sudah ida ida berjaya call ida ida berjaya membantu orang dari segi emosi lah kan
seramai seribu lebih kurang ah seribu empat ratus orang
ah ah ya sepanjang orang yang berada di di pusat kuarantin kan
a'ah lagi apa lagi ah
oh sebab tahun dua puluh dua puluh kan sekarang kita sudah ada
seorang yang ida bantu untuk dia
a'ah so ida macam bagi dia ida berjaya lah bagi dia semangat untuk siapkan
dia at least dia sudah nampak
at least dia sudah ada chapter one till five
walaupun belum nak pass
okay so sudah cukup kan tak cukup lagi eh
okay lagi satu kan um ida sudah ya lah kita anak kan kita rasa macam
kita nak bantu parents kan kita nak bagi duit setiap bulan
okay err sebelum ini dua puluh dua puluh itu ida dah ida maintain
err ida berjaya maintain setiap bulan tanpa miss
ida bagi dekat dia orang uh tiga angka seorang ah macam tu
so ida macam okay so hopefully dua puluh dua dua puluh satu ini
ida berjaya maintain lah bagi mungkin boleh increase
um macam itu ah sebab sebelum ini kan tak ada duit
pendapatan oh okay okay bagus
tak ada lah kot can
oh dia tak yakin ah
because apa
macam rude dia itu bagus ke
project tak dapat jalan
terlalu painful tak percaya ya
saya um dengan bahasa yang sopannya saya putus cinta
then yang lagi yang lagi painful adalah
err kan so so memang saya tak dapat nak buat apa-apa tak akan lah saya nak
suruh dia putuskan hubungan kan so saya terpaksa terima lah
the most lah kan lepas itu second
second err waktu first
eh itu first COVID ini datang saya rasa macam oh sangat struggle
sebab sebelum ini you tak pernah duduk rumah tanpa buat apa-apa
so then tak pernah duduk rumah selama itu
kan biasa berjauhan dua-dua buat kerja so saya rasa benda itu sangat
sangat menyakitkan lah untuk untuk that okay
yang okay saya dalam hidup kan
so adalah yang rapat kan dua tiga orang
then yang paling menyakitkan tahun ini adalah
a'ah tahun okay dua puluh dua puluh kan
yang dua puluh dua puluh ya like bila kita sudah tak ada kawan kita ada kawan rapat saja at
of course lah kita punya expectation itu
tinggi kan sebab ya lah kita tak ada siapa-siapa so
err untuk tahun dua puluh dua puluh oh saya baru tahu dia kawan
so dia kawan adalah untuk untuk err kawan untuk waktu susah
ah waktu dia susah ha waktu dia susah lepas tu
err saya pantang kalau orang menipu ha saya memang pantang
so ada satu hari itu dia cakap dia sudah balik semenanjung
tapi waktu itu kebetulan saya ada dekat airport
so memang terang-terang dia dia itu ada dekat airport okay dia bagi tahu dia sudah balik dua hari lepas
okay kebetulan dua hari kemudian itu saya pergi airport
so saya nampak dia dekat airport so maksudnya dua hari sebelum itu dia belum balik
dia masih ada dekat sini tapi dia cakap dia sudah balik huh
so memang terang-terang itu kak itu dia okay
so saya rasa kepercayaan saya tertipu lah kenapa dia kenapa dia nak menipu
bagi tahu saja lah a'ah
so saya rasa kalau benda itu
benda itu dia balik eh eh salah
tak payah sebut tempat eh
ya lah benda yang besar macam itu dia boleh tipu uh ya lah dia nak balik daripada
daripada sini naik flight kan dia boleh tipu lagi lah benda lain
kan yang kecil-kecil saya rasa macam
susah lah untuk terima okay lain tak ada kot okay tiga saja
yang saya rasa betul adalah saya buat keputusan untuk saya stay di sini
untuk masih ah berada di sini jauh daripada keluarga walaupun saya cakap tadi
saya punya relationship dengan keluarga sudah makin bagus kan tapi saya masih tetap
familiar untuk di sini berada jauh daripada keluarga jauh daripada
itu lah
kita pun struggle
uh apa soalan itu tadi about decision kan
first ya lah bila saya pilih kat sini then err waktu hari itu saya dapat kerja saya dapat tawaran juga dekat terengganu tahu
a'ah sebenarnya
yang pilihkan itu salah apa lagi ah
okay lagi apa ah
tak ada sudah kot
kan tak ada sudah kot
apa ah
sama saja lah
ya lah someone special pun tak ada lagi
mungkin tinggal house mate lah house mate
dua jenis saja lah
siapa ah
mungkin saya punya mentor dalam business lah kot
okay the business Shaklee kan saya punya mentor
a'ah itu dari segi financial lah sebab dia
err dia manage untuk dapat income err

itu dari segi financial lah
okay dari segi
oh kalau macam dari segi ibadah kan benda yang baik macam
neelofah lah kot sebab saya sekarang baru saya follow dia dia punya telegram

dia macam dulu ya lah yang kita yang kita nampak artist kan social tapi
dia punya ilmu macam makin lama makin ah improve dia punya sharing
pasal hadis lah pasal benda yang baik-baik itu rasa macam ya allah bagusnya macam itu
so satu lagi oh seorang lagi ini lah saya punya sahabat lah lelaki
err yang saya panggil dia bapa so sometimes dia macam
err sangat memberi inspirasi lah untuk settle scandal itu macam bersemangat
err oh expect sebab dia counsellor kan maksudnya dia dia punya mentor saya juga lah
so kadang okay dia banyak bagi saya support lah inspirasi
yang tak tahu masa eh ini
a'ah tak semestinya positive kan
untuk dua puluh dua puluh ini ramai lah
sebab dia macam ada dua fasa tau
yang satu keluarga lah sepanjang kan berapa enam bulan kan
so dengan family so dengan dengan parents lah dengan parents
dengan anak buah dengan parents dengan mak ayah anak buah dengan kakak
dengan house mate lah ah itu lah
oh okay ya apa-apa nak duduk call
oh dia orang memang influence ah
kalau kalau macam family tak ada lah influence sangat kan
itu macam biasa saja lah okay kadang ya lah kadang kita yang sendiri minta
dia orang suggest apa-apa kan so tak ada lah cerita-cerita mengarut sangat kan
so cuma kita consider lah kan
tapi yang paling adalah bapa lah itu dari dari segi semua lah
pasal saya punya kerjaya saya punya financial
lepas tu ah pasal kehidupan lah
ya so mostly yang semua nasihat semua ida ikut eh ida ikut saya ikut
okay sebab saya ini bukan yang jenis orang yang baca buku
menyalahkan a'ah

and then ya mama loves to watch al-hijrah punya news because the news all like macam
no the news is like juicy gossip news so one of it was about first news was about the err adik ipar pakai motor dia motor dia hilang
so rupanya dia ingatkan adik ipar dia curi which is true lah dia curi lah as in without the permission lepas tu accident
ya but anyway adik ipar dia meninggal bro
oh about the banjir oh then pramugara buka kedai it was quite fun ah actually when we were watching it
kan macam so juicy
besok thursday eh
you rasa apa jadi
pasal there was there was one part at the end where he carried the baby a newborn baby
lily give birth with seluar
then I thought ushu will kahwin the
ya so complicated and technically he already lafaz cerai
when he said that no he put a syarat he said that if you go and see your father
I will ceraikan you remember
he pull back the cerai is it that's what
because talak will jatuh as long as your syarat is tunai technically dia punya syarat dah tertunai tau pasal dia cakap macam gitu he said kalau what did he say ah something like kalau
you jumpa kalau engkau jumpa bapak kau
apa aku cerai apa aku eh macam mana eh
no lah cuma I tahu kalau macam benda gini you kena consult ustaz because ni fasakh
ya but ya but to be safe if let's say the talak dah jatuh then you have to just reconcile lah and say aku nikah dengan you know you have to lafaz it back eh no need to lafaz it back but you have to do it with a saksi something like that ah meaning you still have to report it yes I'm very sure
that's why yang that time ija ibu dengan ayah he lafaz it right then they already back together what because mubin kept on pestering them back as long as the talak dah jatuh they cannot be in the same room already because they are considered cerai and they have to immediately consult
ustaz or as in like ah
then over there within forty days if you reconcile you don't need to angkat nikah back again
arwah mak long and pak long is cerai cerai dude
kan he already cerai her kan twenty sixteen kan kita kahwin kan ada satu gambar mak long tak ada
ingat tak then mak long tengah ambil gambar dengan kita and then suddenly pak long say ah okay okay kita then he asked mak long to walk away then I was just there like wah that's mean
kawan I satu mengandung then she complained kat twitter dia cakap yang every time kalau part dia share good news dengan family dia mesti dia orang ingatkan kakak dia macam kesian eh
meaning like like kakak dia takde tak boleh ada anak so dia selalu ada anak apa so as in as much as it is not her first child it is still a child what as in it's still a good
uh doa-doa kakak kau ah yang mengandung you know
no uh ya tadi pun nenek berbual pasal rumah
tak pasal abang elfi dia nak beli rumah nenek then nenek is like saying you know
obviously he's gonna nenek still staying with mama
ya lah he's gonna buy it from pak busu
pak busu bought it at hundred thousandish cheap ah so unfair ah
I pun tak tahu why ya
dia nak hantar anak dia yes so now he's grand master plan is five years he have to immediately sell so next year kan anak dia so two years ya so
tu yang tadi one of the parents say
alah dia sihat for the next few years jer dah happy
apa you nak cakap tadi
kan I dah lupa
ni ah nanti lepas ni I treat you to
dalgona kalau tak tidur
I layan ah
no I layan you ah tak tidur
a'ah seh I want to watch more than family seh dah dua hari
dude you lagi into the drama than I am seh cantik eh dia tapi macam flawless
kamal adli macam very like
that's true ah and then meletop I think that was what they talking about like they wanted
ya lah dua ribu dua puluh we are all in lockdown like the whole year gone
kan tu lah masalahnya
semua resolution pun dah tak tercapai semuanya
err of course first of all I have to make sure that I redo back everything yang dah daripada dua ribu dua puluh yang semua yang tak menjadi tu cuma ye lah cakap pasal redo back everything sebenarnya ni bukan dua ribu dua puluh punya dah lama pun daripada I would say from two thousand maybe two thousand ten which is lost weight lah memang nak nak turunkan berat badan lah harap harapnya macam tu tahun target eh
this year target nya lebih kurang dalam maybe fifteen ya
serious ah sihat ke kalau macam tu
oh I cannot do the skipping sebab dengan spine issue lah so macam kalau skipping nanti patah pula tulang belakang so I don't want to go to another surgery for sure not anymore
tu lah
ya achievable so I would say that kalau fifteen maksudnya dalam sebulan kena target at least two lah
tapi tapi sebenarnya one half pun boleh lebih kurang macam tu lah lebih kurang
ya so that's another thing lah pasal vegetarian kan macam ya before this sebab baru adapt to vegetarian so banyak makan processed food lah
actually adapt tu untuk konon-kononnya nak sihat daripada sebelum ni tapi I would say I ate a lot of
like man man-made meat macam tu kan sebenarnya tak boleh so I was thinking of this year kalau boleh nak jadi vegetarian and grow my own food like tanam sayur ataupun tanam
tanam sayur lah basically kita orang dah tanam benda lain kan macam tu lah anyway
ya how about you how about you what is what is your resolution untuk tahun ni
for business apa lah apa apa the idea business yang dah ada buat masa ni
I see surprise delivery menarik
I see so the surprise part lah yang betul-betul make meaningful
I see so macam mana sebelum delivery ni dia akan ada macam set set dia ke ataupun macam memang macam boleh customise ke macam mana macam mana bentuk yang orang boleh ambil tu
okay faham
so basically ni macam err macam bukan professional dia macam lebih kurang special customisation lah
okay tapi barang-barang dia barang macam mana macam uh food based ke ataupun
oh okay lah okay maksudnya dah ada customer ah
oh wow ya ya ya ya sebab ya lah sekarang ni orang pun suka eh macam boleh pergi surprise delivery lepas tu boleh hantar eh boleh share dekat Insta kan macam tu lah
I see interesting it's interesting so apa lah nama the surprise delivery service ni apa nama dia
oh wow okay kotak riang so kotak riang basically like macam gift uh box of happiness lah box of happiness
okay okay okay betul betul new year resolution lah
so what do you have for now ada tak benda-benda yang ya it's still give you some happiness in the world tapi healthy lah
I see tapi sugar free how is that achievable even
menarik menarik so err healthy diet healthy food
basically ya lah macam kita pun tengok kan dengan COVID punya issue I think people are more concerned about health nowadays because somehow in this case like in the COVID issue you really have to have your strong immune system and somehow people say that you are what you eat kan ah so ya penting lah very very important lah untuk
tapi dia punya perjanjian adalah when you get rich I will be the first person yang you have to belanja lah kan aduhai
oh resolution lain apart from losing weight I would say that okay lah dia macam satu we have to look at the whole system lah kan I started with trying to eat
healthily kan I want to err I want to lose weight so I have to live live err I have to eat healthily so I want to grow my own food the idea is not just kita nak kurangkan berat badan is also because I want to save more money
cause somehow when you are on vegetarian diet kan most of the thing yang you beli sangat-sangat cepat rosak tau
especially sayur lah macam tu kan jadi macam I was thinking of and kita tahu berapa lama dah sayur tu ada kat dalam supermarket
kan so we didn't know pun macam kita opt untuk healthily tapi sebenarnya tak berapa sangat so I was thinking of like okay with after I grow my own food I will save more money and I want to make sure that I can pay off all the debt because somehow ya lah mm kita tahu economically macam mana
macam keadaan tahun mendatang walaupun kita dah nampak sinar with the with the vaccine of COVID nineteen and all and so on but the issue is we are not sure how the economy would collapse so I was thinking of trying my best to reduce all my spending
ya when you when you say like that ya it is very interesting because ya sekarang ni ramai juga kan orang monetise daripada YouTube kan and then ya betul betul and because we provide the content YouTube is open platform anyway
betul betul okay ya interesting I should think about it should think about it ya macam
orang kata tanam jer lah tapi sebenarnya nak tanam pun ada cara kan ya ya ya
ya interesting hmm okay boleh boleh masuk dalam resolutions seterusnya okay
ya ya healthy and rich okay interesting so cakap pasal healthy and rich kan kalau lah you nak sum up lah the the I the expectation of two thousand twenty in one word lah apa you punya apa one word yang will sum up what you want two thousand twenty one to be
wow oh okay alright alright maksudnya kenapa yang sekarang ni the the timeline the the stories not good yang you need the plot twist
untuk diri sendiri eh
ya that that's possible actually because ya somehow we didn't know sometimes we underestimate ourselves and maybe sometimes we also didn't maybe for now we didn't find the right person macam it ya maybe with better networking kita boleh nampak orang yang boleh bring it forward kan ya ya interesting for me two thousand twenty one I would say that I would my my like the motto of two thousand twenty one I want is kind
because I I want to be kinder to myself lah I would say that two thousand twenty dengan COVID dan sebagainya it has been very harsh and I blame myself I critic myself a lot in so many ways and end up
tak jadi apa-apa pun so I was thinking okay I want to be kind kind to myself kind to my body like eating eating better food and also kind to the kind to the world lah like environmentally more friendly lah
okay apa lagi takkan tu jer apa lagi share lah resolution
mmhmm what what kind of me time like pergi bowling macam tu
okay so you want to work on any skills that means is it is it okay is it skill yang you dah ada and then you want to enhance ataupun like new skill
ya I still remember like your one of your ambition is like jadi ya jadi pemain guitar oh my god
ah okay ya masa tu kak long pun dah masuk asrama I didn't really update
but but somehow piano like ini dua benda yang berbeza tau mostly guitar punya song it's like metal you know very hard one piano is like very sentimental ballet things like that so it's it's a spectrum is it because you just want the elegance or is it juga makin besar makin matang you become more like feminine in some way do you think that can be that one
I see so with before this kak long pernah juga ada idea macam nak enroll class tau and of course I want to also look into yang macam elegant elegant ni lah kan cuma kenapa bukan piano sebab piano requires some set up lah then tak dapat berlatih kat rumah kan macam tu so I was thinking of beli ukulele ke violin something like that lah so macam at least you can bring it anywhere and you don't really need to the whole band to play with you kan kalau macam belajar yang macam banyak wind punya apa ni punya instruments you need a whole band baru dia akan menjadi or you main trumpet sorang-sorang macam ni lah dia dah jadi macam siapa tu kawan Spongebob I don't remember the name Squidward tu clarinet that's clarinet so it will
ah Squidward kan so it will be like if you play alone nobody will appreciate it lah macam tu
interesting okay lah basically kan macam kita boleh tengok kan sometime our education system
focus on more maths science tapi kan art art is very important human very connected to any beautiful things be it the beautiful things tu dalam bentuk visual ataupun audio lah macam music kan because somehow that makes us
err be more empathy kan dan buat kita more human lah and in your own case kan macam memang buat hard science buat maths kan err
at the end you will turn to robot lah if you didn't celebrate the humanity side of you macam tu kan okay so piano so that's the skill yang basically dream lah belum belum start ah do you have any skill yang just you want to enhance lah yang you dah ada dah ada base base[lah
ataupun something lah selain daripada skill err musical skill ada skill lain tak
but mandarin is kinda hard though because tak silap mandarin kan dia ada macam empat
empat macam apa eh apa dia panggil perbezaan bunyi something you know
ya that's the thing sebab basically ya bila kita boleh connect to to a person dengan dia punya mother tongue it will be lebih ni lah kan
ya ya lagipun kita pun multi racial I think it's best untuk kita pun faham bahasa yang lain juga kan betul betul interesting interesting
so okay buat masa sekarang how many language you know like even it's amateur pun tak faham how many I will say malay english arabic okay interesting japanese
korea korea daripada mana because you watch oh my god alright alright
so many language cakap pasal korea I watch a very very good good drama I'm not sure you have watched it or not tapi dia berkaitan dengan business lah since you pun nak buat business kan
ya cerita tu menarik tau because dia menunjukkan macam mana yes
so orang selalu tengok kan orang business ni at at the end of the success tau like the only the tip of the iceberg lah when ya and then macam kita pun jealous lah bila dia lavishly spend money and all that but we didn't know how broken they are when they are still when when they are very very young and when they start the business because
even though macam belum kaya lagi but there every single day I woke up
even though I would say that sekarang pun belum kaya pun lagi tapi it's interesting and I would say that the in the in the drama itself benda yang paling belajar is you need a good mentor
macam bila you bila you dah kaya ramai jer orang yang akan datang kan berpusu-pusu tapi basically kita tak tahu orang datang tu betul-betul care ataupun just nak ride on us macam tu kan
ya that's the thing so cakap pasal tak kaya tapi means a lot sebab
my business is operating on different model which is I choose a social enterprise basically the business itself adalah untuk selesaikan social issues like
ikut lah issue nya about environmental ke apa kan so because I do believe that in the in the in the keadaan sebenarnya sebenarnya kita perlukan
kita perlukan orang buat business untuk bantu bangunkan negara sebenarnya sebab if we just depend on the politicians is not
it's not going to work lah kita pun tahu politician have so many other things kan tapi I would say that business kita boleh provide like kita boleh provide ya macam cakap lah kerja untuk orang kan kita boleh provide service diorang macam in your case you nak buat surprise delivery kan you boleh make people happy and so I would say that
instead of ya lah I used to work juga dulu kan dengan boss boss bukannya senang kan kita salah pun
kita salah memang confirm salah kita betul pun kita salah kan jadi macam ya but but it's okay I think that's the beauty of young age lah untuk
try error jatuh explore ya explore
jangan jangan berhenti terlalu cepat sometimes you didn't know macam awak tengok kan business business yang dah berjaya
that take years then even just take even one to two years lah yang one to two years ni bukannya entrepreneur dia grant-preneur sebab dia dapat duit daripada grant kan macam tu lah
tapi basically kan err orang perlukan at least six seven years untuk dia betul-betul ada strong base kan so if you stop too early
macam let's say kita nak makan durian kan even though we already see the buah dah ada pun dekat situ tapi kita tak boleh nak kita tak boleh petik dia sampai dia jatuh sendiri cuba kalau kita ambik pokok durian kan kita sibuk nak makan durian nak makan durian and then we go and pluck the pluck the fruit kan it's not going to taste good even though you nampak hari-hari tapi you kena tunggu sampai dia jatuh sendiri
tapi the the biggest thing ialah perseverance untuk tunggu bila buah tu nak jatuh
in the business sometimes you just didn't see what's happening kan tapi
what kenapa apa what what what was
oh so itu adalah interesting part I would say that
he is a good actor tau so basically err sebenarnya kan bagus jer cerita start up ni walaupun dia letak satu lead actor yang teruk gila tapi basically dia nak ajar sebenarnya yang
lead actor pun dah terlalu superficial tau macam terlalu hebat so sedangkan cerita ni pasal budak-budak muda
so walaupun awak tak tengok character nam do san tu sangat-sangat loser kan tapi basically that's how people at twenties macam tu dia tak tahu apa-apa banyak benda dia tak tahu
compare to someone yang dah macam han ji pyeong yang dah thirties tau
so tapi mungkin sebenarnya orang production ni pun tak sangka dia akan backfire macam ni
sebab kalau kita baca cerita daripada synopsis kan ada seorang mentor yang garang suka menghinakan kita pun takkan rasa kesian dekat han ji pyeong tapi because he is a good actor himself yang membuatkan
kita move dengan perasaan dia sampai kita sedangkan character tu tanpa tanpa interpretation daripada dia kan mungkin akan jadi character yang sangat annoying
harsh lepas tu cakap suka hati tak suka tunjukkan perasaan tapi because err the actor himself kan put so many emotions on the face
aiya many conflicts err conflicting emotions yang kita tahu yang he is not bad he is just
err mula-mula dia memang tak puas hati lah tapi when I think back and if I am mad at nam do san I would say that I'm mad at younger me juga
nonton suka hati kita lah kita nak suka siapa kan that is our own right tapi I would say it's a good reflection lah it's a good reflection
three years pun tak ada apa-apa perubahan yang bagus that's the thing
sebab yang lain ada character development tau the other two friends tapi yang tu macam stay like just like that
ya just just better sikit lah ada coat sendiri tak payah pinjam that's the only improvement made kan kan tu lah aduh
okay ada lagi ke resolution untuk tahun ni anything eh untuk tahun ni
eh small thing seh yang buat benda jadi great and big ya
ya that that that interesting because sometimes ya lah macam zaman study I would say that I I'm a last minute person because last minute kadang-kadang boleh push you
like push you lah macam in the very last minute kan you boleh focus and sometimes your creative juice like macam tu kan tapi masalahnya in real life kan when you involved with more people
and other situation you cannot control such as err persekitaran lah environment macam tiba-tiba COVID dan sebagainya kan so macam
procrastination akan backfire you compare to someone belajar yang it's just you and your assignment lah macam tu kan
maybe because you are a person yang work under pressure
ya that's one thing second thing is sometimes you kena you kena combine kerja you dengan team mate lain like just imagine if the team mate buat macam tu to you kan at the last day baru dia nak submit dia punya
drag yourself ya betul betul betul procrastination
and somehow sekarang ni bukan nak cakap apa lah procrastination ni pun
sangat sangat tergantung dekat kita punya social media juga kan macam in my own case lah I will say sometimes I was like okay I just want to watch one video kan tiba-tiba another one and then another one then it never stop it never stop so itu yang menarik then tu lah tiba-tiba cakap pasal tu kan ada tengok satu documentary tau dekat
documentary dekat Netflix ah cerita pasal social network tau macam mana sebenarnya since since kita guna all this services for free kan macam Facebook and all those thing kan basically we are
pelik ah sebab kalau kita bayar baru kita adalah customer kan tapi kita tak bayar so tu maksudnya kita bukan customer maksudnya kita adalah
data err their their modal macam tu kan so
so dia dah baca tau kita punya behaviour dia dah baca kita punya interest ya algorithm yes that's the that's the word so macam dia tahu macam mana nak keep us hook kita tengok one lepas satu-satu kan lagi satu aduh lagi satu benda yang apa kita sebut semua keluar
macam fikir fikir contoh kata oh rasa nak beli katil ah tiba-tiba semua iklan katil keluar
so I don't know I mean they were listening to us lah kan our microphone is always on kita tak pernah pun default untuk tutup kan somehow
ya tapi maksudnya ya maksudnya kalau lah basically okay kalau diorang dengar diorang just feed us dengan ads okay lah tetap okay juga lah sebab dia akan buat kita nak membeli kan but how about if bad people
so tu lah macam bila kita bila kita gunakan service ni for free kan for free
so kita basically menjual diri kita to them lah like okay I am going to use for free so you will get you can take anything from me sebab tu penting kita baca like agreements and all term and condition
macam tu lah like term and condition if you agree tick siapa pun nak baca tick kan kat situ that that's the thing
tapi takpe lah basically the basically the idea is walaupun kita tahu yang mesti yang penting adalah kita kena tahu apa yang berlaku at least kita tahu dia ambil so at least kita boleh jaga-jaga lah more careful like in term of sharing pictures
in term of sharing things kan macam tu
ya and somehow we also have less privacy now macam dulu kan like ten years back kalau kita nak tengok rumah orang tu dalam rumah tu pakai dapur apa periuk apa that is something like ridiculously happened tau macam
kan kita tak cakap dengan jiran kita uh cik boleh tak saya tengok
err saya nak tengok apa periuk err dapur macam mana ada hood ke tak ada hood uh ya but now now basically people can even access like bedrooms of of other person kan because that person boleh buat live dekat dia punya
bilik kan macam tu
ya ya even oh my god I still remember like one house tour that I watched dia siap tunjuk the secret room
and basically kan senangnya sekarang ni with the technology ada the semua kan dengan hanya gambar orang tu boleh terus buat balik your plan house plan tau
hanya dengan gambar sekarang pun technology yang ada with with pictures you take pictures you can even like kira beberapa berapa jarak dengan tepat
and then they already know where is your door where is your window so then macam nak masuk pun senang
yes and somehow this wealthy people pula bila dia keluar melancong dia akan post so orang tahu rumah dia tak ada orang sedangkan sebenarnya rule dalam kita post social media ni kalau boleh kita hanya boleh post pasal vacation after the vacation
yes sebab basically posting all informations about our vacation is announcing that
ya my house is empty go and then curi lah apa saja
itu lah dunia sekarang different lah people
but becoming too transparent which is two different thing tau macam orang dulu kan dia communication nya tinggi sebab dia hanya bila nak jumpa kedai kopi tu tu jer lah masa untuk interact tau so you really have to all out kan tapi people nowadays kan dia neglect
organik punya communication tapi dia boleh share every single thing about dia punya life kan tapi bila orang judge dia marah pula
orang tak like tak tak tak bagi reactions pun dia marah kan so
so okay cakap pasal tu that's there's one more lah one more thing I want to add on the twenty twenty resolution lah twenty twenty one oh my god twenty twenty one because I want to segment my day tau macam
I realise that throughout the day there are so many times I check my phone and check my phone tau so I was like macam I want to segment lah macam okay pukul berapa sampai pukul berapa is for social media instead of checking it all the time basically kadang-kadang check tu actually in notification and an hour and I watch hundred videos already
ya and then macam then all the video sometimes is err ridiculous err like cat videos you cannot stop watching cat videos
it's never ending cuteness kan so macam
so I want to segment lah macam okay dalam masa tiga jam ni I will I will do my best to indulge in social media and the rest I would stay out of it macam tu lah that's the idea
macam quota ah
oh you can ignore lah dia tak macam parental parental control yang terus off oh okay okay
just just to remind you lah bukan lah macam guru discipline something like that kan
tapi ada apps tau untuk buat benda tu which is very interesting I just download it lah macam nama dia forest tau so macam bila you start the apps kan you kena set lah you nak you nak buat kerja berapa lama
okay so dia ada beza tau tiga puluh minit dia punya shrub jer kalau satu jam dia akan jadi pokok tau kalau dua jam jadi pokok ada buah tau
so basically kan dia untuk bantu you untuk err focus so you buka app you set tiga puluh minit nak buat satu kerja kan so you tak boleh buka apps lain you kena tutup dengan apps tu sahaja
kalau lah tiga puluh minit you access your phone pokok tu akan mati tau tapi kalau kalau you kalau cukup tiga puluh minit dia akan notify you okay pokok tu dah hidup and basically everyday you have a patch of forest untuk dibangunkan
yes very interesting so macam ah so macam basically kan dia bagi kita award macam dia bagi reward lah reward macam
okay so kalau empat jam pokok tu masih macam ada buaian
tak so depress
a'ah maksudnya
betul sebab manusia ni sukakan acknowledgement tapi takkan kita nak suruh ya yes
takkan kita nak suruh mak kita kata tahniah empat jam kan it's just like boss datang okay congratulations four hours kan tak logic ah kan
that's very intriguing seh tu satu benda forest ada satu lagi tau interesting juga nama dia sleepy town so apa yang kita buat adalah err kita set lah satu hari kita nak tidur dalam enam jam kan so bila nak tidur kita buka apps tu dan tutup phone dengan apps tu on on running lah okay
so kalau you bangun dalam masa you dapat tidur tujuh jam ataupun you pasal you tak access phone dah lepas you dah set the alarm kan you akan bina the town
sleepy town so basically the town is built while you are sleeping lah so you will enjoy it when you so dia lebih daripada quality life lah so macam
interesting I ya lah saja jer nak tengok apps I've seen because I want to live better I want to have a balance between sleep
sometimes I already sleep tau tapi bila bangun terus nak tengok phone sebab nak tengok sekejap jer end up kan
mula-mula jer yes end up Netflix tiba-tiba kan tiba-tiba so basically dia memang dia memang ada design untuk bagi orang hook
and tapi kita kena take back the power lah we have to unhook all that
ya yang peliknya dia bukan macam puppy tau yang macam memang sentiasa entertain anyone dia diva and then macam
make macam sangat-sangat annoying ah macam if if I need you rub me rub me now and when I don't like it I will just leave you macam tu kan
tu lah orang cakap kan macam bila kita bela kucing kita yang jadi servant to the cat
I think because they are cute tapi elegant
they they keep their eh I know tak lah macam cara dia tidur you know then oh tapi tak juga
tapi tapi ya cats can be very then sekarang ramai orang dah mula macam
ramai orang dah mula ramai orang dah mula apa ramai orang dah mula bela bela binatang instead of bela anak kan maybe sebab bela binatang lebih bagus lah kot dari bela anak kan sebab bela anak ni
yeah maybe sometimes diorang investment so
macam tu lah
oh my god zombie apocalypse tapi agaknya okay lah ya zombie apocalypse tu macam agak-agak macam kita rasa
I don't know I I have seen the video people cakap the science or some drugs can make you like that I don't know lah tapi I would say apocalypse akan berlaku so be it zombie or not but still ah kata lah kalau that's why that's the thing I've been reading about bunkers tau macam menarik ah orang yang boleh buat bunkers kat bawah rumah kan macam tu because you want to save save your family lah at least and sebab
tak payah tak payah zombie lah apa-apa pun datang apa-apa pun kita sebenarnya kena bersedia bersedia untuk ada food ration
and then at least ada survival skill kan let's say lah kalau berlaku
disasters kan actually zombie apocalypse akan leads kepada disaster ah dia akan rosakkan barang akan bajar rumah ah kan dan sebagainya kan so um kita kena ada survival skill
let's say kalau macam mana kita nak um menyorok kat mana kan ataupun kita nak buat apa sebab ya lah so far nak cakap pasal zombie ni kita tak tahu zombie tu macam mana
some some zombie cannot can can only can cannot see kan can only err listen ah macam tu kan so tak tahu cuma I would say that since we didn't know what kind of zombie will come so we we have to be prepared lah kan
let's say kalau zombie semua yang ada tu tak boleh berenang kan so kita kena
ah duduk dalam air kan betul tak pastu kita kena jalan dalam air at least kita kena basic macam rafting ke apa macam tu kan
ya it's not zombie ah we call it bunk out bag dia macam
err bag tu ada cukup lah untuk something happened ada macam first aid macam ada dry food and then macam err your details pasal you punya your blood semua kan so macam kalau orang jumpa you terbaring ke apa you ni tapi kita panggil bunk out bag lah macam tu ya but kalau kalau kita cakap zombie kit tu orang akan rasa oh it's ya maybe it's a good marketing
it can be another thing like how to survive zombie kan but actually err disclaimer sebenarnya ni tak apa-apa saja jer lah it don't have to be zombie let's say lah kalau ada orang masuk rumah you yes war we don't we never know kan macam even though kita rasa everything is so peaceful but
we have seen how a virus turn the world into chaos in this whole year yang buatkan apa pun kita punya resolution tak tercapai tu kan so ya interesting zombie zombie apocalypse there is so mmhmm
so that's the thing that's the tricky part of it lah so macam tak tahu lah kalau macam overseas kan orang akan macam ada kan non disclosure kan macam tu tapi macam
I would say that berapa berapa probability dan possibility dia ah then macam macam mana dia nak ingat kita kadang-kadang kita punya contractor tu pada negeri mana pada negara mana kan so macam boleh berlaku tapi I would say that's why we have to build it now before we get too famous lah sebab maybe ah kan macam for now I would say that if we pun orang akan rasa oh this for safety
but for people yang macam influential kan let's say say it's um
ya kalau dalam movie kalau macam mafia ni kalau orang tu buat bunker untuk dia dia tembak jer lepas tu kan ah of course lah we cannot do that kan
cakap pasal rumah it's very interesting kan how ya people try to customise house kan macam buat secret room macam buat bunker and now people sekarang macam buat apa catio untuk kucing lah eh macam buat hub ya
cat is like social media ah hook you kan macam tu
and make them you know that's the thing err we call it like cat nourishment ah macam cats used to live in the wild tapi kita yang bring in the home kan so somehow they can depress also so that's why we have to make sure that they can connect to the wildness part of them which is kejar rama-rama
things like that kan so that is tapi kalau ada rumah the first thing I want to have is swimming pool lah
seriously you want to hi and things waktu swimming that is a bit like dream like
at least bukan semua baka lah maybe some some breed can lah macam I would say bengal ke apa yang yang very wild one kan tapi basically kalau perasan semua kucing berenang most of them adalah yang short hair
ya instead of long hair ah macam tu sebab so kalau long hair I would say it would be very very very wet and then tak dapat macam wiggle wiggle badan dia how dogs do it kan
ya it's very interesting and then I want to have like place untuk macam
buat yoga with all the sun you know because somehow kan kita macam sekarang ni dengan pakai mask everyday face mask everyday we are less then kita most of the time stay at home working at home and everything because of the COVID
we have less exposure of vitamin D tau but because vitamin D we can only get it from sunlight kan so I was thinking kalau ada rumah kan in the middle of the house I want to make sure the dia punya dinding tu
um made from glass no no made from glass so dia dia dia
sunlight can come in so you can do yoga things like that in the house but still getting the benefit of sunlight macam tu
like buat like igloo style so macam dok macam macam ni lah kubah macam tu
ya the remaining is always nice and I think dreams and hopes is what keeps human alive lah kan macam during this trying time kan macam ya every new year pun kita buat resolution kan pastu kita buat plans and everything because we want to look forward in life lah
macam and most of dreamers pun orang rasa macam crazy people in the beginning kan macam
macam mana kita tengok adik-beradik wright kan the the the wright brothers kan
macam when they want to fly things siapa jer yang setuju
tapi now that is diorang punya determination tu yang membuat we can cross country kan kita boleh experience things on the other side of the world
betul I would say that any tourism related business is high heavily affected lah dengan keadaan sekarang sangat-sangat heavily affected
sebab ya lah diorang pun macam diorang tak dapat nak operate kan
oh tak boleh langsung ya then most people yang kerja dalam industry tu diorang adalah macam skillful people tapi in one area tau so diorang tak ada masa pun nak buat benda lain
ya that's interesting like paramedics pun boleh kan macam tu like basic basic ah menarik menarik so ya lah macam
because senang kan bila orang kena lay off ramai sebenarnya orang yang kena lay off sekarang sangat
dan somehow apart from dulu sebenarnya kita takut dengan industry revolution industry kan bila everything's automated semua benda pakai robot pasal dia akan take away our jobs kan tiba-tiba kita berlaku economic punya macam ni yang yang merudum kan so
sebab itu lah kita buat business kot kan boleh lah bantu orang maybe provide more jobs to people kan sebab the economy have to run lah
ya because somehow dengan ramai orang kena laid off employer pun ada banyak sangat pilihan so the competition is very very high
macam tu kan
and cakap pasal pasal ada kesan besar pada business kan lah
I would say that kesan besar kepada education system juga lah kan macam kids nowadays I would say sometimes bagus juga sebab orang dah mula adopt online learning sebagainya tapi masalahnya budak-budak sekolah ni dia perlukan interactions
dengan kawan-kawan sebab tengok macam universities kan some universities are err fully err fully on online platform kan
tapi bila kita dekat university kita bukannya hanya belajar theory dan kita punya subject tapi life lesson macam
kita belajar communicate kita macam bagikan masa kawan ajak pergi tengok wayang kita nak pergi ke tak pergi kan so all that adalah very important life skills so I am so into online learning I I really support it because somehow it gives more people more access
and some sometime boleh juga bagi tapi I don't know how much the impact will be towards the character building
ya betul betul ya
ya and that's another thing about autonomy like family is not something you can choose kan tapi friends adalah orang yang you boleh choose ya kan so macam
you boleh choose and and boleh align minat dan sebagainya kan compare to ni then ya lah macam same eh macam peer kan macam same age peer sangat sangat penting untuk kita associate untuk kita faham
dan sebagainya so
ya akan jadi ada impact yang besar lah kepada characters building macam tu
ya just imagine before this pun graduates susah nak dapat kerja because
it's a very competitive market kan and now kita ada so many
err talented people kena laid off and compete together with them
ya macam dah lah nak compete each other pun dah hard enough and then kena compete lagi dengan semua yang dah ada enam tahun tujuh tahun experience it's not going to be easy
tapi new economy pun akan terbuka lah macam macam sekarang ni ramai yang dah jadi influencer kan sebab ya like influencer pun boleh give money
dah lama kan
cuma bahaya dengan being influencer ni sometimes they are not being human tau macam
and they ya and diorang ajak orang lain untuk jadi benda yang sama diorang letak satu social status yang sometimes unachievable kita pun tahu macam contoh macam gambar kan untuk bagi nampak abs nampak kurus sometimes it's just about angle
then people yang see that they didn't know pun itu adalah angle sometime they perceive it as true and they force themselves to achieve that sedangkan all that is just an illusion is a it is just an different angle kan camera trick that's the thing sometimes
dah lah tu lah jadi lebih mencabar lah kat kita punya youth kalau keadaan macam ni ya lah lack social skills compete with so many people and at the same time have unrealistic appearance goal
ya even big brands pun sekarang dah start to work with influencers instead of artists yang memang buat art tau berkarya
okay lah somehow artist people diorang charge memang terlalu mahal kan and influencers dia ada dia ada bigger fan base
ya faham
dan artist dan actress ni dia terpaksa produce something dulu kan baru orang boleh look up to them kan compared to influencer ni
pergi makan pun orang suka kan pergi jogging pun orang suka kan so macam cuma tu lah kerisauan dia adalah macam dia boleh set unrealistic thing ah
so fuh banyak juga kita borak ni kan daripada start dengan resolution cerita pasal zombie apocalypse dan sebagainya so ya hopefully takpe lah yang penting kita start sekarang buat sekarang macam
ya boleh
untuk family ah untuk family err I would say that more collaborations macam
ya lah before this I would say that I live on my own lah pun duduk macam jauh kan so macam
I live on my own I just want to achieve my own goal kan tapi I want this family to be more collaborative like masak sama-sama
buat kerja sama-sama and even though macam ya lah adik yang masih sekolah kita tolong macam tu you know like sometimes I feel like is is burdening sometimes but most of the time actually it is a collaboration
yes it's very good one kan even though of course lah macam kat mulut tu macam marah-marah kan tapi basically ah but basically actually basically it's a good thing because
kadang-kadang macam ya lah kita pun kena bergerak sebagai family
betul how about you apa yang you uh foresee for as a family punya movement
aduhai okay lah
ya ya ya hopefully lah macam and it don't have to be far pun but at least places that we can
okay jom rasanya
boleh lah kan kita start put in the planner ataupun buat vision board kan letak dekat dalam semua lawa-lawa kan and satu benda lagi it's good tau actually bila kita tell other people about our resolutions so at least they can remind us lah
ya because when we say it kan tak ada lah nanti at the end takkan lah nanti at the end of the year nanti macam eh apa jadi dengan macam tu kan so macam
so dia orang like um
dia orang want to dia orang exit already tapi dia orang nak masuk balik so when they want to masuk balik and then like the security guard stop them lah
so ya so they they block the way and then like before that I saw them go out already but dia orang like um
they insisted coming in lah and then lepas tu they block the way and then this security guard was like um he turned a bit and he accidentally touched the wife's hand like arm the wife's arm ya correct so he was like accidentally touched lah lepas tu dia
lepas tu dia punya couple tak happy lah habis tu dia orang um so like the security guard
lepas tu dia cakap oh like I nak pergi beli uh I nak pergi ambil allen key
ah dia nak pergi ambil allen key lah daripada dia punya service counter lepas tu um
after they take the like they want to take the allen key lepas tu dia cakap eh err please tell him do not touch people I'm like okay sure but like honestly I looked at it and then they were blocking the exit and then they were stopping like at least ten people from moving so it's dia orang punya pasal lah
err when when they left I ask this security guard lah like you know um like tak kisah pasal dia orang lah sebab dia orang um they they were trying to be difficult lah because you are just stopping them from entering once they exited because there's only one way exit one way enter right
so lepas tu another security guard datang lepas tu dia cakap oh err this couple lah they have a problem lah they told me already like about how the other security guard tried to touch the wife then like I also question mark lah why why
why um why do you err err how did he touch in the first place lepas tu
dia dah cakap lepas tu they leave the security guard feel okay maybe this one is just a problematic customer lah
lepas tu there's no allowed nobody's allowed to eat in the store
eh tak boleh cakap nama dia
tak boleh cakap nama store
tapi like you are not supposed to eat there lah because
takut you expose yourself to
ya lah lepas tu dia argued dia cakap oh my wife is eating I'm not eating and I'm taking the allen key
lepas tu we're like no
jadi dia cakap lor you know like um
correct because technically this virus is gonna extend until one year so like you you cannot just like sit down kat rumah and then like melepak tengok tengok youtube macam my bapa so that's fucking unproductive I don't like it
oh like you're doing this you're doing that you know at the end of the day you're gonna get like pahala I'm like sometimes kan you buat kerja bukan pasal pahala you nak buat kerja pasal you nak care for the person you know
lepas tu you tengah cleaning buntut lagi
you nangis
ya lah tapi you nangis ke tak
macam you kasih birth to anak tu lepas tu anak tu yang nak mati dulu kind of thing
wow nasi rawon bukan nasi biasa tau
you tahu kenapa tak pasal I would think that he thinks like you are more easy to manipulate and you are more kind so kalau you are more easy to manipulate and you're kinder even though it sounds like bastard to say
tapi like you know people like to tend to take advantage of these things macam even when like I'm usually like I'm usually a kind person and all that right and then like you know after awhile you notice like oh I feel like they are taking advantage of me then like I will just stop lah or just like you know I can't do this for you anymore
because like memang like I think it's just human nature lah like they trying always trying to find ways to take advantage of people but I just find that is not a way to live your life
tu memang dah macam amanah lah pasal dia sedekah gaji itu kan
mm alhamdulillah banyak rezeki
you macam apa tu um in debts lah
me right simply if I really care for that person I don't mind but like at the same time like kalau is those people that I'm not close to or whatever right then like um
like it'll be nice if he would I mean like for me I think he would feel that it's nice if you could send him off you know you know I mean macam like bila dia dia dah nak meninggal kan habis you ada kat sana
tapi at the same time meh pasal dia punya selfish thoughts macam begitu he should let you go because
like you know you need to go and live your life because after he dies maybe in like one or two years I don't know I'm not praying for him to die but like bila dia dah meninggal like you have to live your life and his ah if he's asking you to sacrifice your life
just to jaga dia bila masa you nak you nak belajar
lagipun dia ada banyak family around here daddy is swag
correct because I mean I understand lah kalau you ada family kan tapi tak close dengan family tu macam like saudara saudara tak tak rapat kan
tapi like um in terms of helping right ya lah like that lah but like like you just have to help your family lah you know
like my um my side of the family is like kalau ada kerja kahwin or kenduri right my family will be the one as helping the rest of the family near extended family they be like the women will be busy makeup lah blah blah blah all that shit I'm like
lepas tu like one of them had even the cheek to say like when at that point kan they will like going to get married soon they'll like eh nanti bila kita kahwin uh
kau orang suka tolong-tolong kan nanti kita err kita kahwin kau orang tolong ah this kind of things it's like
I don't think that's how you should behave lah because then you see the core of your personality you know lepas tu like this particular cousins they are like always
ah even when there is a wedding they tak datang on time dia orang datang lambat even the people that they're supposedly close to ah like like these cousins these two cousins are so like is apparently close but then even on that cousin's wedding day
the close cousin pun datang lambat so I feel like ni apa punya attitude ni lepas tu dia orang dah kahwin and they're going to breed this kind of
job but err my step mum ada lah tanya dia cakap ada cukup duit tak then I'm like ya cukup cukup cukup
tapi like I told you before right like my father memang apa macam babi like you know like he fucking like um tengok
tengok youtube every single day pukul
sixty only ya and he watches he watches youtube in the fucking morning and then when I want to mengaji then he on the bloody video damn loud then I can't concentrate you know
after that ustazah he just wants to watch because he's bored nobody wants to talk to him
like like then after that I ustazah say lah like like you know like
err perlahan-perlahan lah baca lah kat bawah buku tu ada cakap baca dengan perlahan kalau err perlu err ulang lah lagi tapi I cakap dengan ustazah ustazah bapa saya tengah main video saya tak boleh concentrate lepas tu ustazah macam awkward lah macam oh okay
for me right my my bapa is
macam pemalas jer gila babi tau
like satu dia like dah lama tak kerja and he's just err waiting for government to give him money
and then like um err what do you call that like dia tengok youtube videos every single day pagi-pagi pukul tujuh setengah dia boleh on kuat-kuat until like late at night he watches but nowadays because the other day he confessed to me he never pay
um electricity bills for two months can you imagine that shit he never pay for two months habis dia nak dia nak siapa yang bayar
dia tak nak kerja then um ya then I just keep quiet lah like it's your problem what I mostly not at home and you are the one who's youtubing like the whole bloody day so I'm like whatever lah you know
err he got his heartbroken and dia dia nak console lah kawan dia lah
lepas tu kawan dia punya crush
err slept with eh will slept with a friend when she was drunk so like technically like for me lah I like dia tu bukan you punya girlfriend couple dia punya crush sahaja you you nak sad sad lepas tu you nak macam ada apa tu nama dia macam
you nak um act as if she's your girlfriend for what you know
lepas tu my my my my my my brother just had to bloody say that uh oh kawan dia actually kaya dia macam from a well to do family lah lah lah lah
do you know what my father say he say um oh jadi kalau kalau adik kalau um pergi keluar dengan dia eh nanti dia nak dia nak belanja tak belanja belanja coke ke apa ke
lepas tu macam mana you tak darah up kan so I darah up I cakap
kalau nak kalau nak ah jumpa kawan bukan minta upah apa lepas tu dia dia cakap
err dia cakap dia macam nak weekend excuse lah macam dia joking but I wasn't having it I was angry
lepas tu what the
ya I mean like fuck man like dia dah tak nak kerja dia selalu nak my father lah dia tak nak kerja dia selalu nak tunggu orang kasih dia duit dia lah pemalas
put clothes in the the washing machine and then err gantung which takes less than fifteen minutes honestly
and then like he expects the women at home to do all the shit for him like kerja um kemas rumah masak lipat baju makingkan dia kopi
I mean mm tapi kalau you old school kan you kerja apa
jadi dia nak tunngu orang kasih dia duit aje macam apa macam babi tau and then I even have like I'm working with a guy um this pakcik he's about seventy plus seventy two
dia masih kerja I saw like another one is like I'm sure he's about seventy plus eighty lah this other old man and he's so handsome you know he so energetic he's a handsome old man
you know what excuse does my father have to to not work and like like lounge around and wait for somebody to macam kasih dia duit you know what you mean lepas tu I tak suka tinggal dekat rumah sebab I tengok dia unproductive I rasa macam beban tau like
oh kakak you know err we were talking about how when you die right and then um um
there's an option for you to stay with your husband or wife in the in the bumi right
my step mum cakap dia tak nak jumpa my bapa
ya lah so in bumi you ada mark like husband and wife right tapi in syurga you nak you you still want to be together or not
ah my mum say tak nak myself say
I can see sometimes he's caring but ah as as the days go by as I watch him every single thing he say triggers me in a sense that macam became geram became macam kau dah lah pemalas tak nak buat kerja kau also nak meminta-minta dekat orang buat apa
lagipun right half of our lives he never raise us and huh correct dia tak kasih nafkah pun jadi macam mana dia nak expect kita yang anak-anak yang ada yang empat empat yang dah besar ni nak selalu kasih dia duit ke apa ke correct
I mean we don't think like that lah tapi my mum is the one who thinks like that but at the same time we think like okay I will just give what we can give but we will not give our father we will give our step mum
until my step mum macam berasa macam bersalah lepas tu dia cakap oh nanti err ni siapa dah kasih duit siapa dah kasih duit
ya so for me right usually kalau I nak kasih I kasih my step mum lebih macam say
he also likes to count people's money mm macam dia cakap oh like your sister mm dia nak beli rumah dekat malaysia semua semua semua like berapa ribu lah
lepas tu he like to compare oh kalau your sister kerja dekat singapore the versus your err brother-in-law who's who kerja dekat malaysia dia punya gaji berapa berapa berapa berapa
ya he no the thing is that he wants to count right after you say he will say things like can buy these can buy that sekarang can buy this can buy that and then like somehow right we will see the underlying err meaning macam actually bila kasih I duit macam gitu
like itu yang kasih you marah because the fuck you why the fuck are you counting my money and then secondly you don't even raised me and then after that now you like what the fuck you know I mean the only good thing he has ever done in his life
the house that I'm currently living in now it's the best thing that he is evident lah but that also he cannot pay because he work and on and off right jadi um my step mum yang yang he was refusing to give
because he like calculative say oh you from the kampung you indonesian lah blah blah blah balik kau punya kampung blah blah blah blah blah blah kalau aku tak kahwin kau
like you punya life tak better lah blah blah blah blah
macam gitu sampai sekarang tau dia mungkir macam gitu atau dia punya fikiran kan I tak suka
ya like you know this kind of thing like you count people's money you tak nak you nak duit delivered to you it just doesn't resonate with him so like and my younger brother pun macam I rasa macam dia ikut-ikut macam my bapa tau like dia selalu dia cakap mm
lepas tu me and my eldest sister we're like kau boleh born dalam poor family tapi kalau kau mati miskin itu kau punya problem
allah dah kasih kau banyak avenue untuk cari rezeki untuk bekerja keras kau yang tak bekerja keras kau jangan nak blame orang lain
and like err play computer those kind of shit you know you are privileged eh and he doesn't realize that or acknowledge that jadi I feel like wah kenapa eh like is it because they never live through the life that the four of us live through
tak tak tak I'm just like I'm just stress over my life in the sense where like you know when will the man in my life be useful and wake up you know everyday I fucking see them sleeping in the room watching watching youtube being fucking unproductive even though like my brother is on holiday all that shit right
so macam I don't know man it's like
tapi sector macam mana
I tak boleh I teach drama and english before
ya I've met a few people in my life were like those like oh I'm just contend with sederhana which I cannot relate to
poyo siol
yang you yang you yang you what um apa tu err this this answer thing is it like um it's like a notes for the exam lah
but I would say it's because of err bumiputera but you are a singaporean malay you are not a malaysian malay mm there's a difference
it's cheap what you know but the thing is at like like what I would normally tell people lah like I tell you before right macam kalau you nak beli benda sana kalau you tinggal dekat sana fikir macam orang sana
I keluarkan lima puluh ringgit I bayar dua puluh empat ringgit untuk shampoo is tak memadai it doesn't make sense I'd rather choose a cheaper alternative or like whatever you know
dia tu yang yang itu lah yang err text you yang tanya is you
ah kau memang dasar orang melayu
kau yang babi eh nak orang putih padahal kau hitam babi
sawo matang oh okay
mm kan you punya suara kan macam abang-abang pun
macam apa number one candidate untuk orang kahwin lah
ah you tak bilang
eh tu tak fair because like how can he choose it's supposed to be the choice of the people
ah nanti you you tunjuk I ada gambar
tapi you tapi you
pergi keluar dengan kawan right like another guy right
kita jadi in ah kita jadi in pasal kita use triggered jadi budak kecil
ah tiga minute lah
tapi um I feel that kalau you excel very real like you will be like top top one top five percent maybe they can offer you like uh there are some companies would like sought you out you know then like um give you accommodation and all that and then get you to stay there to work for them

like a few months dah aku tak jumpa kau is it a few months
mm ada lah
ke january is it
ya tapi I mean aku still contact aku still contact kau I still contact you on on on mm
do a lot of things lah but macam
I mean tak lah aku betul juga now now that you now that you mention about err last time when we were in school we
sekarang aku baru ingat balik actually ya lah actually quite true lah macam aku used to
primary school aku dulu kat katong punya area kan then
then there was macam a lot of
macam drains ada banyak longkang-longkang besar
so that time tengah primary school tengah pendek kecil kan so like
after school nanti main bawah longkang masuk bawah longkang then keluar dekat lagi satu punya longkang punya area keluar kat luar jer kan
that kind of thing so a'ah lah betul juga lah so I think
wow jauh eh actually wow hougang sampai bukit batok jauh seh
park connectors dia tampines
ya it's from tampines to pasir ris like a shortcut bagi pergi ya main basikal so
so far if kalau pergi jauh-jauh aku tak pernah aku tak pernah realize seh
ya dah ada ya dah ada
to from sun plaza park sun plaza park yang belakang
ah terus jalan terus connect to
connect to ah pasir ris lah it's a shortcut masuk pasir ris
ada ada ada err actually actually tampines street forty five yang belakang is actually connecting
dia actually connected to connected to bedok bedok reservoir err then
nowadays my school is only err usually now is only four days sahaja
now at this age nothing much to do lah so ya quite sian lah like macam like
I thought macam I thought like I thought
macam like seven eleven jobs is easy to get kan but
to work somewhere in uh plaza singapura lah plaza singapura then I can err it's
second they called me they say which ah which area you'd like to work in then I said plaza singapura then
they send my resume to plaza singapura then
they have a different way of macam approaching things lah they
people have more macam people are more more polite lah bila I talk to people
macam really down to earth they they know
east coast apa tu
aku suka pergi oh
I mean aku aku aku not the outdoor outdoor ke type of person lah aku aku tak suka
macam aku aku
err aku tak suka kotor-kotor lah aku tak suka pasir-pasir you know pasir-pasir then
memang best lah kotor-kotor ah but macam the next
day macam hari hari kemudian macam
bila time pagi nak balik you know nak balik nak kena
nak kena mandi nak kena
nak kena bersihkan pasir-pasir you know that kind of thing habis dengan
pagi-pagi buta rambut tak shampoo all that macam aku tak macam
aku tak suka outdoor punya benda because of that sahaja lah aku
oh I mean ah ya lah I think ah aku rasa it's a macam macam macam ah
apa ni self esteem dalam melayu apa eh macam
pendirian diri ah eh bukan bukan lah I don't know what lah sudah macam like
self esteem lah aku
will affect my choices macam aku will affect aku punya
err whether aku nak ikut kau orang pergi east coast overnight ke tak
so kalau aku ikut kau orang pergi east coast and aku nak overnight aku nak kena
nak kena pack barang-barang aku semua lah like like
like I've to make sure aku ada ini ada itu ada ini so besok aku will feel
maybe mungkin it's a mungkin it's a penyakit ah I don't know lah but ya lah
ya I think I think I think betul juga ah apa yang kau cakap macam like um
macam let's say macam main dekat rumput main dekat rumput kadang-kadang I mean aku
aku punya mind kan aku dah fikir pasal rumput tu kan
nanti automatic kan automatically aku punya kaki gatal sendiri tau macam
suddenly aku dah rasa dia punya gatal dia macam pasal aku
macam betul-betul ada ada betul-betul betul-betul rumput ini akan menggatalkan kaki aku lah then aku
straightaway kaki aku dah rasa gatal dulu macam
aku rasa ada something ah macam tangan aku pun kalau tangan aku
macam ada sweaty palms ah berpeluh
kalau kalau kalau aku tak fikir pasal apa-apa apa-apa eh
dia okay tau tapi bila time aku
nak start buat kerja something ke apa eh
bila time aku dah start dekat depan computer aku nak fikir lama jer kan
aku rasa straightaway tangan aku berpeluh tau so macam
dia ada effect juga ah macam
aku rasa anxiety problem ah macam
macam oh aku kena habiskan kerja ni
masa tempoh ni then straightaway aku punya otak aku dah fikir oh
dah ada macam jadi rasa takut lah
oh jadi
itu lah asyik berbual pasal aku jer daripada tadi
aku tanya pasal engkau pula lah
ya lah I mean itu lah I mean cause sekarang umur kau berapa
sudah forty kan oh ya itu lah I mean
lagi twenty ah haiya I I don't know lah macam
aku tak boleh look forward lah I mean but ya lah
cepat lah one masa berlalu very fast lah to me like my masa
a lot dah tukar lah I mean a lot of a lot of changes lah dulu singapore dulu dengan singapore sekarang kan macam a lot of changes lah cara
makin laju everything became became faster
then macam everybody rushing then macam like
aku feel last time was more um
ke time lockdown eh time lockdown I uh lockdown period I think
mm takut tak lah I mean
ya actually aku actually I I thought of that also lah I mean I I already
you know I I I decided to macam I came to
it's not something you can like belek here belek there and like go
and not get caught or what macam
ya betul ah eh I remember I remember those times lah macam
err hopeless lah you feel quite sad lah like like like macam like
macam going through hardship right actually a lot of other people are going through more hardship lah like
ya that one ya lah betul lah I mean I feel like macam
ah lah there are a lot of a lot of view a lot of macam views on that lah macam like
will say different things lah macam
like nature nature telling us something ke apa you know that kind of thing so
itu lah we just have to make the best of it lah
ya lah but sekarang I mean um ya definitely macam that time aku baca dekat news
aku baca dekat uh yahoo news that macam a lot of a lot of deejays yang main
a lot of like uh house deejays I mean like resident deejays yang main dekat macam
dekat fullerton dekat you know dekat
ya ya all the deejays yang spin
semua most of them out of job lah habis
from earning like macam like
like food online or online or macam food delivery online then
bars and all that lah macam whatever that has music ah
actually macam counter that thing yang is actually can survive and
ah ah if you're comparing macam like music eh audio and video right
uh right now video is important lah macam there's more video jobs like for internship like more video jobs err
ya lah so sometimes I feel like macam
would have been different lah but but ya lah macam nasib ah
mm betul itu lah that's why that's why right now
I mean ada macam I I got my school
so actually I feel honestly right now aku feel like macam want to give up lah because
macam there's no more industry there's no no more music industry right then
then I'm like in year three trying to finish my diploma in audio then macam I feel like sometimes
like want to give up lah pasal like like
you know of of course there's still macam online streaming all that lah cuma
you know netflix you know netflix sekarang they have err all the singaporean movies
everything is on the Netflix right now you know then like macam
oh is it oh tak ya ya all the way lah right now right now all the all the old singapore movies is on
okay so okay nama aku
tahun ni is uh tiga puluh tahun ah tahun ni aku tiga puluh tahun so uh untuk aku is
macam mana nak okay okay lah err maybe before that also lah
before that aku kerja dekat public utilities board lah uh it was ya you you know ah
ah bill air lah bill air
so ya so that was my first job lah ever since aku I I've I've been working there err untuk enam tahun ah so err so err
ya I I applied for err I I was quite lucky sebab
uh aku apply kerja tu and uh
ah apa ni ah aku kerja sana for enam tahun
at at that time pun
then err I also I also same like like like you lah also thinking what should I do what's my career path because honestly speaking pun at that time bila aku apply itu kerja pun
aku aku
dia bukan ah
I rather than kau dah abeh duduk rumah tak buat apa-apa kan so err so might as well
I just took took up the job lah so err when I took up the job I aku got a lot of free time and aku pun look around aku tengok kawan-kawan aku aku punya friends
so aku pun fikir I think I should also do that tapi I also I also made a mistake
like aku like follow the aku follow the
err apa ni
like in a way follow the trend bukan ikut hati bukan ikut hati sendiri ah
so or everyone's anytime at aku was like saying to myself oh everyone's furthering their studies so I should also take up a further my studies ah I didn't I I didn't really err
a degree then I I asked myself like okay what degree should I take at that time aku aku pun tak sure lah nak nak
nak ambil degree apa then aku cakap dengan diri aku okay since aku working in this line
I apa my boss
I have good relation with my boss then they they they see an opportunity in me then is err kirakan err is one way for me to progress lah
ah so as to be honest pun apa my diploma pun anytime time masuk poly pun
I just take up this course ah it wasn't err err it wasn't it wasn't like oh aku passionate about this course err aku nak nak jadi engineer no ah in it was nothing like that lah

after a few days pun it's the same it's the same thing
kau pun dah nothing much to do abeh ah like err after a few
weeks tak tak silap aku ada lagi satu engineer engineer ah engineer baru masuk engineer dia engineer baru ni masuk dia sekali pandang kau aku memang tahu lah dia ni engineer dia pun dari india juga ah
pasal the the the funny thing is
masuk site office eh dia duduk kat tempat yang aku duduk yang aku tidur tu
so he literally
took up my my my place ah kirakan dia macam ibarat ganti aku ah
so aku
at first bila dia dia datang like
the first few days dia masuk aku tak berbual dengan dia sangat ah pasal aku tak tahu dia engineer as in aku tahu dia engineer he was part of the company is an
employee of the company tapi aku didn't know his background so hari-hari ah
ah so hari-hari aku datang office aku tengok dia pun dia pun macam aku time baru masuk dia datang office duduk office pun duduk
so aku pun aku tanya dia ah I ah pasal
ah kita attachment semua kita nak kena err put up a report apa kita punya own individual report
so aku
ah aku pun need someone to to to give me some input ah like all these technical technical details apa kita buat apa benda yang bangla bangla
dia orang yang tengah bikin apa benda yang dia orang tengah bikin so I need someone to explain to me ah so aku tahu dia ni engineer he's part of the company tapi dia pun tak ada kerja dia pun macam aku
aku tanya dia lah aku just take the opportunity ah aku tanya excuse me are you an engineer
so that explains a lot lah kenapa dia dia macam aku duduk lepak aje tak sebab dia punya project belum start lagi so that's why the the company
I asked him to to come over to this project first sambil tunggu the his project start lah
so aku
dengar gitu aku like okay ah aku punya mind macam terus ada light bulb ah okay bagus ah aku boleh boleh apa
ah minta tolong dia untuk aku punya report ah individual report ah
terus aku aku korek ah help me tell me what is this explain to me what is that gini semua abeh dia dia bilang ah
abeh after that day onwards pun
err dia dengan aku sekaki ah err err dia pun selalu come let's go let's go out jalan-jalan err pergi keluar jalan-jalan pun ni ah jadi orang tak tak
tak tengok kita tak buat apa-apa ah ah
asal tak tidur dekat sana ada got some certain days certain days we kita ada tidur kat kat ah kat tempat situ kadang-kadang pasal we did an upgrading project in a apa
kadang-kadang pun kita ah apa jalan-jalan dalam sekolah dia kita tidur dalam classroom that was during the holidays lah so the school was empty ah
kirakan err the
dekat site eh
yang paling tinggi is only the project manager lah and project manager that time aku punya project manager perempuan so ah she also
err wasn't the the macam mana nak cakap eh ah
there there are some ladies who are macam rude ah dia orang dia orang can do both the office work and the site work tapi yang that time aku punya internship my project manager she was more of the office type lah
so dia duduk office aje ah kalau higher ups ni semua ah dia orang jarang datang site
at most pun dia orang datang ah apa once err
dia orang pun tak akan dia orang pun tak akan macam err
ya probably they want kalau dia orang pergi site pun nak tengok progress you won't go into
macam dalam-dalam ah dia orang setakat jalan dekat tepi tengok oh okay ini dah siap ini dah bangun ini dah bikin dia orang tak akan masuk like literally masuk
aku so the good thing the the engineer came aku minta dia tolong so like
aku pun help to update my my weekly report
okay lah aku
uh one good thing pun aku pun like have to be smart also lah macam aku pun tahu office orang semua
cakap aku aku datang pun tak buat apa-apa kan so bila bila this engineer dah datang aku dah dapat dia tolong uh aku punya report
so bila-bila aku nak kena bikin report aku buat dalam office ah I mean that's the only place also yang aku boleh buat apa
that's like like that's that's the only setting yang kau boleh buat kerja apa
so ada juga lah there's there's where other engineer pun start to notice ah wah dia ni ada juga ah bikin ni bikin ni buat ni semua pasal like a few weeks later ada lagi satu budak
attachment masuk
ah budak attachment ah
dia pasal kau dah hari-hari datang office pasal it's just like a very ah small ah small office
so hari-hari kau datang office eh kita masuk kita punya site office sebelum masuk kau nak kena buka kasut kau ah
so satu hari tu aku aku macam biasa report late to work
aku sampai office aku tengok kat luar pintu
pasal kau dah hari-hari datang office kau dah kau dah cam ah kau dah cam ah ah
ah ni kasut dia ni ni kasut dia tu
eh hari ni datang ada kasut baru ah ni ada budak attachment baru ke okay ah ada member ah siol aku ingatkan
local poly ke apa ah local student aku dah excited ah at least ada member eh pasal kau hari-hari kerja pun muka muka sama mendak ah
sekali aku buka pintu masuk office buda china ah siol
dia dia err and he he's he's not from a local polytechnic lah he
bukan bukan he's he's a he's he's from china tapi dia punya course is from
err err err apa ni err building construction authority kirakan macam mana nak cakap eh
ah macam
okay ah it's to put it simply macam
ah aku
aku masuk fire fire fighting apa eh
dia orang ada separate course apa fire fighting course eh macam
tapi untuk building building punya sector ah kirakan aku masuk ni course
aku dari poly tapi untuk some students hantar
ah so so okay ah dia so bila aku nampak dia alamak budak china pula eh aku ingatkan pasal kau tahu
at that aku tak tahu lah sekarang still I think now still the same tapi back then
they couldn't speak english well lah and then they they just speak mandarin to you aku pun dah ibarat macam
err apa macam ayam dengan itik ah berbual
so okay lah  aku ingatkan ah okay lah at least ni ada attachment ada budak attachment okay lah
ah err just talk ah pasal
apa everyday pun got nothing much apa so just try to strike up a conversation
err strike a conversation pun like he doesn't really understand what I'm trying to say pun aku pun tak berapa faham
aku pun tahu like he doesn't really get me so okay lah just just
just err or just hi bye gitu ah
but the funny thing was apa ni
dia lagi apa eh err
dia lagi lagi laid back dari aku ah siol
a'ah ah dia lagi lepak dari aku lah siol
dia like literally
bukan nak kata aku like the model student ah aku pun aku pun ada juga ah memang ah aku lepak ah tapi aku pun err you have to be smart ah kau tak boleh
err macam selalu err apa err
tunjuk orang kau you have to balance it out ah
macam aku bukan aku hari-hari pula err datang datang office lambat
ah so aku aku hari ever since office boy dah dah macam cover aku eh office boy dah dah macam
ah dia dah tolong tolong aku aku tiap-tiap hari datang office lambat
pasal aku tahu aku dah tahu dia punya timing bila aku datang office tak ada orang dalam office so selalu aku datang bila tak ada orang dalam office
ah ah tapi when
when it comes to bila kau nak tunjuk muka ah then kau
tunjuk muka ah
ah so you you just have to be smart about it ah tapi yang this this other guy like he literally like
err dia punya suka ah
dia ah
dia dia the good thing untuk aku aku ada orang cover aku the office boy
like you have to make you use you have to network ah you have to network you had to make connections tapi dia ni dia ni tak ada connections langsung ah ah
ah office boy approach tapi language barrier juga ah
apa dia pun in his own world even the the other engineers
the malaysian chinese enigineers pun dia orang pun cakap dia ni
apa dia ni tak boleh ah dia ni buat hal sendiri
apa so so that's that's the thing ah
that was my experience lah for my for my attachment so it was from that experience yang aku tengok
eh siala rabak apa aku tengok the working environment macam it's so stressful aku tengok the the engineer yang dari india tu kiwak muka dah macam zombie
tapi untuk aku ya aku was just a student apa so aku just report to work like the usual like eight thirty to six something like that lah aku macam mana pun
pukul enam aku chao ah pasal they they don't really have have anything much for me apa tapi like those engineers like
dia orang after six pun dia orang still
err ya so abeh aku tengok like the work environment macam
semua orang buat hal sendiri macam not much interaction
like ya it's true err aku can understand they don't take me seriously and aku pun wasn't expecting them to take me seriously ah aku kau cakap gini pun aku teringat ada satu kali tu it was the first tak silap aku the first day ah the first day
aku report to to to aku apa attachment
so kan aku bilang kau apa ni err
everyone was so busy pasal they have a meeting so after that err they all left for the meeting
aku aku seorang aje ah dalam office
aku seorang dalam office sekali alih-alih ada satu orang masuk dalam office
dia pun tengok aku dia tengok aku err tak
tak kenal aku pe macam dia ni siapa siol abeh tanya oh who are you aku cakap attachment student oh attachment student abeh dia tanya aku err singaporean ah ya singaporean
dia dia dengar singaporean terus dia straight talk direct direct punya siol
you singaporean why you take this course singaporean where where want to work in construction one work under the hot sun work under the hot sun ini semua gedebak gedebuk kiwak aku dengar terus down siol serious aku dengar terus down
tapi ah ah tapi ya lah apa that was
I was still young ah you you you didn't really understand it lah tapi bila dah lama kau dah ini kau dah kerja kau dah in the industry eh
so apa ya so
after the experience aku was like siala gini rabak pe err
so err err lepas bila aku tu tu yang aku pun make me
fikir ah I like aku betul like sial ah betul ke nak kerja err construction industry rabak gini
tapi at that at that at that time pun macam abeh kalau aku tak nak kerja construction industry pun aku nak kerja apa sia
abeh aku fikir-fikir abeh aku dah belajar ambil diploma ni pun dah dah dah tiga tahun takkan nak
okay lah cakap dengan diri
aku even though aku
aku still don't know what to do with my life since aku already have this diploma which already err took up three years of my life okay lah I just just might as well take up a job
aku ya aku applied for
which I applied ah ni I applied the stat boards public utilities board ni semua so okay lah alhamdulillah err within one or two weeks they get back to me and aku got the job quite quite fast ah
um ya apa time aku
ya bila aku dapat kerja pun like
pasal like err when I join the company
then they because it's a big company apa so they have this apa induction course ah
it's no longer your your your age age age group ah so you meet all kinds of people lah abeh abeh jumpa abang-abang ni semua apa
oh engkau umur berapa
ah ya ya around your age ah oh muda lagi ni kau punya ni kau punya ah first kerja aku cakap a'ah
oh apa kau patut
err muda-muda patut kerja luar dulu kerja private apa rasa dia punya susah payah dulu err kau dah kau dah tahu dia punya susah payah baru kau masuk
baru kau masuk err
government state board ni semua you know lah because they see government iron rice bowl which is true lah definitely I I won't I won't a dispute that ah
and uh so when they when they say that aku pun like eh
alamak aku pun did I make the right move ke tak eh err err like
you were saying ah kau
a fresh fresh graduate baru baru baru baru graduate ini semua kau patut
err kirakan start from the bottom ah start from scratch
bila aku happy kerja
and aku pun so it it gave me like
err doubts lah aku pun like
did I make the right move ke tak eh
tapi I mean
apa it doesn't really matter also lah
just went along lah abeh macam
aku pun fikir balik like
err ya what he say really err apa like
ah tak bedek ah but
was stuck in my mind for for a few weeks ah abeh aku pun fikir balik macam sial ah aku baru dapat ni kerja abeh takkan aku nak takkan aku nak resign oh just
because aku nak nak nak listen to that guy kan
uh apa uh
I mean apa you
you just made do with what you have ah you just make do with what you have memang betul
apa the the at that at that time my my nature of work
err apa
it didn't turn out quite that bad also pasal
macam you're not sure from a technical point of view you I can always refer to the consultants ah so
abeh err from
from aku punya nature of work pun project management pun what what I
back then pun aku wasn't really a
a a apa ni I'm
I am a very quiet guy lah aku not those person go around talk talk to people I mean I still am
so so ya you aku aku
improve on my soft skills and then dekat err during my course of work pun there like what I told you ah who decided to further my studies take up
like I told you before lah apa aku time ambil degree pun was like
doing a degree I should also do a degree tapi
uh aku was just following the trend ah tapi now now aku fikir balik I shouldn't have do that lah I mean ya I you should still take up a degree but then
and uh what you really want to do ah pasal that time
apa err
since you say it like that pada aku in my opinion it also depends on the industry you are in ah so you are in the what in the arts industry media industry
arts industry ya okay um which I agree lah which a degree is not really ah apa a need ah
when aku did my degree uh
err aku did my degree while while working kan abeh as years go by eh
aku kat kerja aku like
aku tengok aku punya sama ah like
work environment pun
aku tell myself sial ah aku aku aku don't see myself
aku tengok aku punya bosses eh like
macam err
dia orang ada takde pun macam beza sia
like they are just like pasal okay
organisation kan like ya we have a apa like uh
tapi stat board they call it lah
when kau pun pun you should know ah kan hierarchy ah it's like
literally like fucking lot of hierarchy you know like abeh macam
kau kat bawah eh macam
tak boleh buat decision abeh kau nak kena
err lepas kau nak kau nak lepas kau nak kena
abeh orang atas dia pun kadang-kadang nak kena tunggu decision orang atas dia lagi
I mean kadang-kadang politik macam orang atas yang paling atas tak suka
like apa sia ni like
kau orang err kau orang cannot make a decision abeh aku nak kena buat apa siol
bertahun-tahun lepas punya sia
you like even even before even before you join the the organisation or like eh siala kau orang dari dulu eh abeh sampai sekarang
more like pada aku it's not healthy ah abeh abeh macam aku like kat situ eh aku kerja situ like siala macam aku kalau stay sini aku tak nak sia end up macam kau orang ya I mean like some of them they stay they stay because of the money like ya it's true ah aku
dispute it lah apa err government really iron rice bowl lah as in like
but aku just don't see myself doing that long term ah
to to change line ah aku decided to go into aku wanted to do media so
err after my apa ni err my degree ended
aku graduated
aku took out a course dekat mediacorp
at first aku didn't know about it also like as in I I do
ah apa sebelum aku enroll under mediacorp
ya I I did some I did some research ah of courses of media courses ah apa that's where aku like macam aku menyesal lah siala like instead of me doing this degree in project management I should have like straightaway
it's good lah it's good lah uh so aku was like err apa siala aku tahu dulu aku
and then apa that was
this school ah aku dah aku dah lupa ah nama sekolah dia ke something like that it was it is it closed down already ah
ah something like that ah aku pun dah lupa ah
then apa ni so aku just still err
to go ahead with it aku look up ada ada aku aku just look up on google lah of of ah media courses ah abeh aku fikir balik ah macam
aku baru habis aku punya part-time degree aku did my part-time degree for five years
aku dah like that five years eh aku pun like like like macam in a way like macam drag myself to to finish it ah
abeh err
lepas tu aku sekarang nak go into media industry kalau aku nak ambil degree aku nak kena
aku was like siala five years of study dah dah macam dah cukup ah like ah enough of studying ah sia ah enough of studying ah I mean
ah abeh
aku fikir-fikir balik takkan aku nak take up another degree
another three years of degree for media abeh aku just look out aku tengok mediacorp offer offer
this is but it's a diploma ah it's just a one year course okay lah one year aku cakap dengan dia okay lah masih boleh take it lah one year okay lah so I I I I grabbed it ah
then err aku pun
transition into the media industry kan so aku like thought of err maybe err take a gap year first ah before aku joined the media industry
so uh apa aku
was planning to take my gap year which was this year aku uh already plan to go to new zealand
a working holiday if you heard of it ah basically I basically it's it's a holiday tapi ah
kau boleh you can apply for a job there
but ah but it's not it's not like those or full-time jobs lah it's like a temporary jobs like maybe like six month contract jobs ataupun part-time jobs are those kind of jobs ah ya ah so
so err apa ni err
kalau there's an option for you to extend another three months provided you work in their horticulture industry
pasal ah their country they have a demand for the industry and they need they need workers are in the industry kirakan dia orang pun ibarat macam singapore singapore we need demand for the construction industry
so they they make use of this err apa ni err backpackers foreigners to come to to to err holiday
and err at the same time these people need money to continue their holiday apa so they make use of this people to work in the horticulture industry ah so aku
aku dah plan ah aku dah book aku apa flight semua aku dah aku dah err dah dapat dah visa aku dah apa ni err aku dah apply deferment pun untuk aku punya
semua dah settle semua dah swee tinggal nak
nak ni je nak naik flight jer
ya I mean it's it's it's predictable lah apa aku punya kerja pula aku nak kena bagi one month notice so err apa ah
aku decided to like literally ah resign err one month before aku punya flight ah aku tak nak resign too early pasal aku pun need the money lah
I have over there apa
so aku pun decided to like just err retire one month before my flight
aku was seriously like the the suspense eh was like wow like only
apa err
when the news all broke out oh apa COVID
ni semua apa ah
at first macam the whole the whole world were were singing praises for singapore oh singapore have their best system they have the best ini itu ini semua gedebak gedebuk tapi aku dalam hati macam okay lah aku harap that like
err maybe err new zealand they dia orang like closed one eye on singapore because
kononnya singapore have a very good system in controlling the the virus they will still allow err err visitors to come over lah
sekali but unfortunately that
did not happen ah aku punya
ah apa
ah three weeks before my flight ah so at that time when they announced that aku dah already tender my notice aku dah resign pun
ah abeh like fuck man at that time like siala macam damn when when when that news came out eh aku rasa macam like like rasa macam bodoh ah like ah
not really cheated macam
ya ya ya err abeh macam
betul lah I mean
it's not my fault tapi like I really felt stupid at that time ah macam damn like like aku like aku pun dah bilang err aku punya boss semua like aku didn't like literally at my workplace inform all my colleagues oh I'm going new zealand ni semua like macam macam excitingly like break the news to them ah
aku like just keep it to myself lah tapi of course dengan aku punya boss aku nak kena bilang dia apa aku aku nak resign ni semua
abeh boss aku pun of course they they dia orang pun tanya aku kau betul ke nak resign apa ah
at that time pun pernah tanya aku if aku nak reconsider ke tak resignation aku aku cakap tak ah aku still want to go ahead
he respect my decision ah dia cakap okay ah this is your decision I fully respect your decision if you really want to go you just go ahead lah okay lah so when the news broke out that new zealand they close the borders aku like fuck man like siala ah
dah aku dah tender aku punya resignation abeh semua dah dah dah settle flights semua dah settle logistics semua settle
habis sekarang tak jadi eh aku dah then err the the other things that came into my mind ni ah sekarang macam mana takde kerja takde kerja abeh like

but then kaki semut semut you cannot move right so you need to learn macam your breathing and stuff like that
I didn't realise yang how hard it was until um they got a review lah somebody wrote a review then cakap
complain lah they complain banyak banyak about the acting of the other actors or blah blah blah then after that
cakap about the best potrayal was the portrayal
because I was so still they didn't even funny thing bila I think got this one uh kakak melayu
orang rupanya so she was like she was surprised yang she so she was shocked lah to realise actually I was a real person lah so okay
um mula mula so not wrapped ah macam dorang ada cover dengan kain gitu ah
ah no no no no no as in so dia macam apa tu
my there will be a set kan kat belakang tu ada macam ada the table so I I actually so you cannot see half of me lah ya I'm just like top half I was like lying down like that lah so I
so my leg actually boleh lah my leg can move but then err just to but then I make sure not too much so that they couldn't see so that was my first
um then no we were like training what we wanted macam training then after that apa tu um second show I was
stage managing I was helping and then after that um the actor problem lah tak tak selalu tak datang lah apa tu hangover lah blah blah blah then after that the director cakap
there was one rehearsal a lot of people never turn up but then they say okay guys can you just apa tu um can you just
and then my director macam wah I never knew you can act eh so then she text me then say okay then next time um can you take over his role lah because he's very problematic
but simpan tak
actually itu ah what is influencer
ya actually it's true ah that time where I so geram you know pasal apa tu I got I was trying to promote one of the my programs lah when I was doing coordinating work right I was coordinating apa tu um
her Facebook posts one Facebook post and one Instagram post ya and itu pun bukannya dia macam uh she write any oh no
she actually she wrote something but dia punya her posts were so funny because
the after that post is very hard to track whether apa tu yang the
your your press conference eh no press kit no bukan apa
apa lah
your post bukan they put on theirs right
is it like some of the comments dorang cakap apa
mm mm habis
tak tidur ah kau
tu pun kirakan macam apa tau macam branding kan
eh apa tu number
company apa nak buat uh
what have you thought about apa tu your branding about your selling point eh apa ni bising bising
tu lah oi
perlahan-lahan sikit boleh tak ai okay okay okay tak apa um
kecoh lah okay patut boleh quiet tapi dorang semua
company okay you wanted to sell apa tu nak jual buka kedai
can jangan lupa nak kena code switch sikit eh nak kena code switch melayu okay
bagus lah bagus lah so ah it's
selling marketing tu yang paling the difficult at the moment actually nak buat
one person said to me lah nak apa tu kalau nak
nak buat business senang
cuma nak sustain tu ya nak sustain
apa yang orang nak orang pun semua macam very fickle
hmm what do you mean tak faham
orang yang bayar ya
dia punya dia punya sense orbit lah the fashion sense
not bad so siapa yang jual I mean siapa yang buat
where you manufacture you jahit sendiri
pandai mana kau dapat suruh contact contact sebegini
kena ajar juga eh sometimes okay
but from dari kecil from growing up you really wanted to do this ah
apa lah tak apa
engkau memang yes
apa apa yang cons dia
mati cepat in in what sense
apa car crash eh apa uh plane crash
apa apa juga pun kalau dah ajal like what you say lah
no clown doctor is considered doctor okay lah is not is not really but I was a clown doctor so is a um apa doktor badut dorang panggil um
no lah I think growing up I very you cannot decide lah nowadays also I also think about it kita we always ask ask a teacher also right I sometimes I ask the my students very young ones like what
power ranger then I was like okay lah boleh lah power ranger but you know
but at that time I remember what is it you know I wanted to become a dentist pasal my gigi berterabuh
my gigi I think fall down and then uh I all of my front teeth semua macam
hitam tau like pasal I think it it was chipped and then after that ada ada darah stuff like so I got very ugly teeth growing
I think it was because I was sick then I realise ugh you know what if only I can become a doctor and then um I just got the idea from a lot people lah one thing I wanted to become scientist also pasal that time pergi madrasah then after that my ustazah cakap apa
err kalau ada lalat tu kan lalat dah jatuh dekat makanan terus masukkan terus lepas tu gaul
kepak dia tu kan satu one side kepak dia ada uh
what do they call the poison and then or the toxin and then the other punya kepak tu ada
dia punya antidote penawar dia the medicines I want to say who ah I I'm curious ah
which side of the of the kepak of the lalat tu yang mana satu toxic yang mana satu what
because when I was in I was I was so I was always late and then every time I kena punished and I don't like to be punished then everytime before because I know
so dia cakap macam eh macam cool eh korang apa ni what you do performance and I enjoy that lah but I was in science I was in triple science at that time
pasal to get into medicine here at that time ah for me you need to get straight four A's
geram seh but anyway ya
so ya lah and err I remember my teacher you know mister yaz telling me to like eh bila ya lah where are you going to
just drop one subject lah just drop one subject because they were they care so much about apa ni dia punya school punya standing ya they don't want they want to get us to get as many A's as possible lah so ya but then in the end I just decided to
this person tak boleh ajar ask me can you take over so okay then I take over then after I take over then say eh you are actually quite good ah uh
ya tapi tu tu show ada banyak problem seh
but the problem also not not not related to me lah pasal dia punya management lah they don't know how to sell the show they making lots of money even now you know a lot of people uh some of the
macam last time also I was pakai fikir apa tu alah nak buat like I always have this embarrassment tau kalau everytime kita buat show kan
how much to sell the tickets for then when you sell ticket alamak macam too much lah too expensive lah like I don't think people will want or like cannot afford cannot afford because we will we care about
the uh apa tu
bila kita calculate the budget
cannot it doesn't make sense we are losing in the end in the end we are not even err we are actually give it like say as if it's charity because we where we pay for other stuff we have to pay macam
you'll get loss lah rugi ah
okay noted tiga puluh minit oh wow
cannot decide ah kalau makanan makanan nak kena lit ah
dia teh tarik is always my actually I'm addicted to teh tarik it cannot kalau tak ada tak ada the teh tarik cannot
like even kalau
kat india okay lah not bad ah that time I was in bangalore
dorang kan ada dorang punya apa tu yang masala chai so and things like that so okay lah itu kelakar because
kecil kecil so I always like tak cukup I have to keep on buying and buying and buying later so in the end I came I said oh I saw they have this bigger cup for other drinks ah terus cakap can I have
boleh because dia dia tak ada the pricing tau for that thing so they just like anyhow give me a price so I said I don't mind then the next day I said even that not enough I brought my own water bottle I want your masala chai in my water bottle
chai just means tea that's why when we play scene when you when you say chai tea eh siapa tu
oh kita pause
kejap as we pick up some delivery
okay sambung balik
banyak distraction lah delivery lah
kau punya phone jangan mati eh dia okay ah
apa aku cakap oh ya okay lah so I think kalau makanan what favourite food I will eat
okay lah kalau drink teh tarik kalau makanan I don't know
I like nasi ambeng but I don't think I can eat nasi ambeng hari hari
buat selama-lamanya mm oh maybe okay lah kalau okay kalau nak fikirkan right I think
if I were to really strategise it something yang healthy
I don't know maybe protein shake ah not protein shake lah the one the one yang ada all the all the meals like
it's for survival dia macam okay you remember you watch matrix you know the yang dorang makan benda apa benda tu
then the guy was saying like um they were in the they were in a vessel uh but then after that they will makan some like some bubur or like porridge ke apa benda
dia cakap oh this is all this is everything that you need for your health that thing ah
um nasi ambeng maybe uh I don't know
for lunch nasi ambeng ah maybe something else
okay let's see what other prompts dorang kasi
promosi oh promosi beli satu percuma satu apakah yang paling teruk okay
ya lah maksudnya kalau macam
eh kau kan dulu kecil kecil ada belajar tu
hmm apa benda tak elok
dia ada batin batin ada dia kan ada kat masjid en-naeem kan
like that you bilang you bilang ibu ah
tengok ah
I also not so sure pasal to me dia macam nampak macam dancing
haven't melayu semua melayu silat
apa tak explain sikit
buka bunga apa open open flower open flower
so it's about really respect lah adat adat adat
okay then kalau martial arts what martial arts you want to learn
apa eh
the flying the flying arm bar I remember dia ajar macam mana nak buat flying arm bar
ni masih uni ah I think because
doing merepek-merepek stuff
because I did I do film school right so he study apa tu
then they were were trying to choreograph some the steps ah then I okay then aku more to learn lah then he show me a flying arm bar
ya ya ya so macam mana I got the video ah choreo but I remember it was uh
like ya ya so you you hook on to the tangan and then after that one of the kaki will
ya gitu sekali banyak kali ah that move actually they look a lot dekat apa tu what a lot of the fightings sequences lah that kind of hollywood
pasal okay so now eh do you about the guessing culture and asking culture
okay you know uh I was baca lah pasal okay can
so guess culture okay this question okay that I ask you ah kalau macam all your friend a text that you somebody didn't not your best friend ah think of uh somebody you jumpa every once a year or something like that
I'm using that person okay so let's say this person tanya okay ayisha uh can I uh macam stay at can I stay at your place for two weeks
eh oh okay gitu jer eh
kalau an asker
they know dorang tahu yang apa tu if you ask a question there's always a yes or no
two weeks macam
not as lama lah but they will say like how how could this person even
how dare they ask me like that question asal dia tak fikir pasal so there's a lot of like issues that come with it pasal
you either macam
who wants to come over and stay at your place for two weeks dia macam kurang ajar lah very rude how can you ask me you know and we're not even that close you know
got the hull invert um because they think like ada
but for so that's a point on guesser lah so I realised kita
there's a yes or no um people ask right ask you a question why you asking me that why ah apa motive kau eh what is it for faham tak
um macam for example lah
uh oh aku perasan apa yang you leave your
that that apa tu yang
if it is a western country I think boleh lah
but they don't understand apa tu yang
uh dorang tak faham
impian eh
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk apa ni
it's okay sekiranya anda harus menyerah segala-galanya bagi mengejar impian anda apakah yang akan anda risikokan malay>kau ni melayu dia
ah aku tahu melayu tak we don't speak like that what
wait kalau kita cakap bahasa melayu kan
pasal maybe
I okay this is what I learn lah melayu yang kita belajar dekat sekolah is not
is not the melayu
in conversation melayu ah
siapa seh cakap macam gitu
tapi no actually okay kita
I mean I I got ada kawan I do speak melayu tau I do speak malay with um
uh cuma with the bahasa the like the language yang bahasa melayu yang kita pakai
ah no no kita tak pakai bahasa baku pun kita pakai bahasa I don't know they call it bahasa pasar ke but they is like
macam mana like it's not
it's not the language yang kita belajar in school
then I also wonder kita belajar bahasa tu dari mana
uh aku rasa wishes ni mesti lebih realistik lah tak boleh yang merepek-merepek lah okay kalau realistik wishes aku rasa aku nak get rich lah one of it lah one of it maybe untuk get rich
the reason aku nak kaya pasal actually err aku nak tolong orang yang kurang kemampuan
then kalau yang kedua mungkin nak jadi fit ah aku nak jadi fit aku fit aku rasa macam aku pergi lari ah err dekat bedok reservoir ke macritchie ke I feel that uh my body feels good lah so I think getting fit is one of the wishes that I want
superpower okay so err we are moving from realistic to not so realistic ah okay so superpower kalau boleh aku nak teleportation teleportation kalau tengok cerita X men eh dia sikit-sikit macam night crawler
err so kalau teleportation I can go anywhere anytime that I want
um to a certain extent pasal lah tu err bila teleportation okay kononnya tak ada teleportation eh macam sekarang ni
kita dah kena expose more err how should I say it uh more unknowingly for example kita naik kita squeeze squeeze dekat
kalau kita squeeze squeeze naik atau naik taxi grab driver ke taxi driver ke ah kita expose in that uh area kita duduk kat dalam ke kat dalam kereta ke
untuk beberapa minit ini ah ada yang research cakap tiga puluh minit ada yang cakap kurang
jadi kalau ada measure measure contohnya macam uh sanitisation
let's say nak pergi giant okay I teleport to giant I take I buy my stuff buy my things buy my groceries then I teleport back
and I rest at work and exposed again ini tak boleh kalau kita dah teleportation teleportation kita skip all the buses ni semua ah all the transportation ini exposure
ah tak kan begitu
but then when this err banduan keluar daripada penjara dia akan dia akan mm apa ni orang kata
kena pergi kursus ah kursus-kursus um macam mana ada yang saya pernah lihat pergi kursus-kursus macam mana nak megggunakan komputer
menggunakan aplikasi word excel kenapa teknologi telah berubah
jadi mereka dah behind time so ada masalah juga kalau kalau terlalu lama tapi mungkin dalam satu dua bulan mungkin okay kut
okay lah eh jap err kita err
saya teringat something ah yang pasal teleportation ah kita uh ni eh reverse sikit ah eh teleportation eh kononnya teleportation ni kan boleh kita boleh teleport
um bila kita umur sepuluh tahun
uh kira-kira ni macam so called macam time machine begitu ah uh macam advance yang lain sikit nak jumpa sikit tu dia punya invention tapi tak tahu lah dah ada ke tidak ni
uh jadi kononnya mungkin tu boleh teleport reverse time eh maybe kita teleport ten years old
nak cakap apa dengan awak punya uh diri tu okay kononnya awak jumpa diri awak bila awak umur sepuluh tahun apa yang awak nak cakap dengan dia
err salah satu err experience yang aku pernah mengalami ah adalah dia ada sikit kelakar sikit lah ah tapi dia real ah
dia err it was when I went diving okay so I went scuba diving uh at tioman
bulu roma ternaik ah bila bila teringat pada peristiwa-peristiwa yang lama yang telah berlaku
jadi ah apa yang berlaku adalah err saya sedang membawa lori lori yang berkelas tiga so err saya tengah bawa macam biasa
tiba-tiba err saya tidak bawa begitu laju tidak bawa begitu perlahan saya mengikut had kelajuan yang ditetapkan err di road tersebut lah di jalan raya tersebut
jadi err bila saya bawa
the person a a driver the driver that uh was err almost hit me was very alert and he swerved and I also swerved so luckily err nothing happen tak ada benda yang berlaku cuma paling paling kena maki sahaja
tapi itu pun okay itu kena maki tak apa biar kena maki jangan hilang nyawa
ah itu adalah uh experience saya lah yang near death experience or rather I would say a near miss ah how about you furqan
oho dah macam pantun berkerat
yang lori balak itu yang bawa tanah bawa simen uh yang tu semua lah uh dia orang kerja trip
lepas itu dia orang punya gaji ikut number of trip kalau dia orang
kan kurang lah gaji dia orang ah mungkin dia orang pun ada dia orang punya err sebab-sebab kenapa mereka nak
err lebih sikit dia punya gaji mungkin err anak dia nak sekolah ke apa ke apa-apa jer lah dia punya dia punya alasannya err
huh how much your gaji ah
wah shiok seh macam gitu walao my one even though for
ah tiga bulan jer
I just like okay buat buat kerja ini semua ah buat hal sendiri lepas tu dapat duit hooray just pergi pergi gitu
got oh my god I tell you ah got this one pak cik ah
okay pak cik err you just err sit down I take your basket
okay the basket got a lot of ubat lah so I take the his ubat and put in the queue cause he miss the queue mah
then you know what he say ah hello hello why this counter tak ada orang ah tak ada orang ah tak ada orang ah
huh kenapa tak ada orang then I say mm
shareena shareena just diam aje just diam dah buat bodoh just just forget about it don't care about him
he he he confirm not not puas hati one just just
ya nasib sia if not ah oh my god if not I'm I have to like
how to say ah like my peak already I was already annoyed and ni dia lagi nak cari pasal dengan aku then I'm like I'm already a new staff
banyak kali kan oh apa ni ramai patients
satu jam tahu macam gini macam mana ni satu jam I said uh yes uh ma'am
younger person also they would be more like oh a younger person maybe I can hentam ah ketuk this ketuk this
beratur like satu jam dua jam ah but this one
for their own ubat ah they cannot what cannot wait you know you see that's the difference ah
you know now COVID nineteen right so macam banyak
ya I don't want to find like some kerja itu semua
can freelance but I also can like you know I can kerja like under a creative studio or
what should I do because when it's COVID nineteen semua benda macam
semakin menurun so I've been thinking about internship
because I'm I do macam you know the video ambil ambil video kat kat video ah I do like
poster poster buat buat poster but for their events
but it's just that my designs macam I my direction
not how to say ah macam
tak ya bagus bagus design sangat it's just
lesser design elements so macam tak berapa
I were to be versatile or what I think I need to like macam gain experience
closer closer to what I'm what I want to do lah you know what I mean like magazine editorial ke apa ke you know
ya ya but like mm it's a bit hard especially COVID nineteen lah like what I'm saying macam dah dah ada ni penyakit semua it's like it's hard to even go out it's hard to
that are related to my career it's more to like macam survive ah like tak ada duit you know like you know like now like
err I feel quite sad lah like sekarang zaman sekarang our our like generation like
survival ya so you just take whatever lah ambil jer like what else
masak masak kan ah ah masak masak so like even now your I feel like your industry also kena affected mah
what what we the future future contain cause like I feel like COVID nineteen kan kan dia teach you how to humble down and like
around you at the moment so like live the moment you know ya macam kalau you plan your jauh pun then your plan not
go to plan then like you will feel upset something then macam nak give up gitu kan so
I just hope for the best but not too much don't expect too much that kind of thing but like I feel like if we do out best in in anything I think boleh lah boleh lah we can make it lah
ya budak budak sekarang like okay I would say like now there's a lot of like
there's a lot of new things maybe like new food or what that kind of thing like for example bazaar you know this ramadhan can't go like mosque or what
yes it's also affected kan so macam a lot of
and like how to say I feel so macam deprived gitu macam tak ada orang nak cakap it's not that I
aku selalu actually middle actually aku ambivert ah
aku actually ambivert but basically I choose if I want to
like but now I prefer to be alone ah but it's just the people that I macam nak
siapa siapa yang I'm close to I want to just just meet them like okay I have a few other friends with it I think like I'm sure you
ya so macam ya now I'm introverted and I'm not mad about it but it's just that
since we're in our house macam kita kat duduk kat rumah kan it's more like oh sometimes we are so blinded macam
more changes to more ya progress to like macam make singapore more
like the quality semua ke apa kan like more err out there
macam kau yes correct correct
macam tak like tak ramai sangat yang
setuju um I don't know what I'm talking ah but like they don't agree
ingrained already it's like oh eh um aku dah apa I'm already like brought up this way from my
parents I need to be this way that kind of thing so they're a bit stubborn macam
degil sangat lah you know what again but I really hope that
they start to macam open up sikit and then more or less
what rakyat you know caring you know like I hope singapura macam
I don't know economic macam image you know like how macam singapore nak
that like banyak banyak gaps a lot of gaps
so aku lapar sial aku lapar sial like
you know I'm lapar I don't know what to eat also
but it was not bad and I found out that it's actually halal because the the is new
there's no halal sign so I asked actually halal it's just that it's processing the
now you just kau dah apa kau dah shift aku punya ah mindset sekarang to pasta
ya I don't know uh macam dah lama sangat
that one is like kita punya own timing punya break
I'm not a person who'd bangun pagi oh my god
I want to because is it yang mcgriddles tu dah dah
sedap seh I feel it's very nice eh but I'm like
sorry McDonald's kenapa kau selalu bagi mcgriddles macam sikit sikit jer

but uh everytime after makan breakfast I will tend to have diarrhoea sakit perut
the mcgriddles punya I think the heavy one is the egg one
ya ada
boleh boleh ah boleh ah boleh ah tak lah kat secondary secondary
actually I can recall almost banyak ah
I don't know ah chill eh kejap let me think let me think

ah I use that as a floorball ball lah then the thing I use use use I play aku practise lah
aku practise practise practise and you know the grip is not nice
floorball stick is softer the grip so ya my hand bengkak
ah I swear aku tak boleh shoot sial aku tak boleh shoot
it will never be a high shot macam shot or low shot gitu so I was so frustrated because the rest could do it
because okay basically kan floorball is macam yang banyak perempuan lawa lawa semua
because they never ajak us ke apa they just let us one side
okay okay tu bagus ah actually
floorball macam collective it's a collective you're in the floorball then you means you're floorball members ah so
then macam okay ah apa set ah then I then I go interview then I like

because I go to I go watch macam tengok tournament itu semua kan some of my friends are in the national team
I don't know like you minah like that eh I don't know why ah I damn scared of you sia
I know okay one thing for sure kau punya idea bagus gila like no joke and some
but that ni but I feel like cause kita tak banyak orang ah tak ah dah tak tak banyak manpower pun ni

like your whole kampung can stay there
like you can just say hi mak
dekat sebelah like your mother house like literally dekat sebelah but you get your own house
nak ada apa durian rambutan
it's like so besar aiyoyo boleh jadi gila besar dia
is like must be besar lah kalau if it's like macam
kecil I mean like all singapore houses is like so small so kecil
a rumah sebesar
ah betul juga eh ya how come I never thought of that no but then like susah seh kalau macam
staycation tapi staycation masih like around singapore pe
besar ah rumah dia
so it's not made up of kayu you know like last time like they always made up of kayu
you like kayu or you like concrete
you got stay in kayu house before
never ee kentalnya
you know what they call that rumah panggung
that's why like malaysia I don't know eh malaysia like jarang seh
splinter nanti ada splinter then like mak tolong mak ada splinter
mak kau marah sia
north is like uh tempat macam sembawang ah yishun all the atas atas
what is happening there tak ada benda actually okay if you put right uh
okay you think about dia punya benda-benda yang ada dekat sana
nak migrate pergi mana
or to danga bay ya they've got pool you can just go out of the fray a bit I thought they are both right ni
jauh for what
north pun jauh seh
I think the red line super panjang seh dia punya dia punya line macam never ending
you daripada marsiling pergi
after the next stop after marsiling dia macam rasa macam forever dia just tak sampai-sampai macam
nama dia dekat like if you see the listing kan nama dia
tak tahu ha I don't know I don't what is it
oh ya balestier untuk orang kaya tau
untung lah ya man
landed mahal seh landed
wah so expensive seh I really tak sanggup like
kalau nak beli like the four room lah
ya like I would macam spend the
tak tak muai seh
wah like inflation ini semua inflation
empat ratus something empat ratus million juta no I don't think it's billion billion
banyak kan
boleh rent out
I think can make my own kilang
kecoh sia ya
macam oh aku ada kawan kat sana tak ya
tak ya book apa airbnb ke
and then some more you stay at the like two three storey house seram seh
because the currency also lain jadi macam
cost of living kalau if we kalau kita kerja kat sana
err you can also cause kita like we planning to get at woodlands so it's like woodlands area is just so near to then she say so aku kata like you beli rumah dekat woodlands
err you all err rasa macam you all save enough money to beli rumah dekat err
then you all just beli rumah dekat abeh rent out the rumah dekat err singapore ah dekat woodlands
abeh nanti orang cakap like imagine satu rumah like seven hundred dollars
satu rumah eh seven hundred dollars
satu bilik seven hundred dollars up to eight hundred fifty dollars
sebab tempat dia kat woodlands
and then after that then you times like let's say the rumah that I want to go for is empat bilik
no dekat singapore ah so seven hundred uh times four
so one month you earn two thousand eight you never even kerja
so like two thousand eight abeh dah tu you convert the money to malaysia
ah tak payah kerja seh
okay so like rumah kan dia ada ninety nine years lease
so kalau freehold that means like you can stay there forever and ever you can go generation
jadi dia macam forever and ever jadi
let's say ada anak cucu cicit
then dah tu sebab dia orang dah ada the rumah
then they can just like rent the rumah then they can just buy another house because it's like
like they have like macam a certain like oh you can only okay if let's say you are a diploma then you can only earn like two five
two five abeh you need to expect to buy a house with the two five
so ya like macam susah seh and you like
apa namanya apa after diploma ah degree
ya after degree abeh setakat macam dapat like a three hundred dollar raise like a starting pay of two eight
why I mean like sedih you know like cause some people like they don't have the money to even pay for a degree
abeh dah tu like you expect like
kita to hustle sama
untuk macam dapat the same
everybody standard like that is the price of the house to the house tapi ni macam
sebab kita punya level is lain
so macam
buat cantik ah resume tu buat cantik cantik swee swee ke
degree is like macam dia punya baru punya in thing tau

dah kata degree
oh shit mahal seh
tunda lah beli rumah tak akan beli
aduh peningnya kepala
tiga puluh ah tiga puluh

oh ya ya ya betul betul betul betul
eh but I think like the trend kan sekarang is like
semua orang boleh jadi independent like girl dengan girl like guy girl is girl guy is guy and like
if I wanna like work towards something like I work hard for it ah and then after that then err kalau macam
nak slack off
so I think the zaman dah berubah change already
now zaman sekarang orang
like perempuan like like girls
the guy's pride the maruah of the guy which is like
I mean like sometimes it's tak boleh avoid
for satu for one person to kerja
macam mana nak cakap macam sole breadwinner ya like it's impossible like
tapi commission pun tak stable seh
satu hari like you can like satu bulan you can only earn like macam tiga ribu abeh the next bulan you earn lima ribu
lagi like COVID I think COVID nineteen was a good example like
then macam wah so difficult that's why like I think susah kalau like you based on like
apa nama dia commission jer
tapi dia buat satu kerja jer pe
so so dia punya pay tetap dua ribu lima ratus atau the pay already
because sekarang dia ambil orang lain punya commission
abeh like
oh no okay so wait her pay dua ribu lima ratus
abeh dah tu kalau sebab sekarang dia ada commission kawan dia so how ever much the commission
of dia punya kawan let's say satu ribu then after that dengan dia punya satu ribu
oh okay okay faham faham
she untung ah
branches cawangan
okay faham faham faham faham

okay lah dah lah
dah dah okay
okay sini sini
mana kau punya web WhatsApp
ah aku belum synchronise
uh twenty nine but I tak terjun botol punya orang sebab I I don't know because that time I rasa macam I terjun botol when you actually uh proposed to me right I rasa macam like the happiest girl on earth lor then macam
macam semak because the thing is that um it's not very often for me to get um
I don't have boyfriends before I have like boyfriends like macam those people who idiots people lah but then uh
ya so our age was catching up so we feel like we old wah sudah tua mahu kahwin lagi ha ya so
I rasa macam I think this the right time for us to get married
but remember that time we kena kena tipu
the for our kad jemputan
to your mother also lah from actually stopped me also mak mak stopped me
I actually oh the next one the problem was uh the kalau the tak nak nyanyi eh tak nak show up we got the best tau he's the funniest guy the funniest guy ya quite popular he's she's actually
huh ya he want to back out because he said something like he not agree with the with the caterer lah then that caterer also say um I don't know lah he's like that lah the perangai macam apa lah gitu so I was like macam ah merepek seh perangai
ya attitude then ya I was like you're funny but then still attitude macam siak so macam uh eventually I
call I I try to find kat facebook tengok ada tak siapa-siapa so I found
then that kan so all the lagu semua lah ada lagu melayu semua all mesti ada dah ada pun dah bagus uh baju semua awesome but the only thing that I scared for all the weddings right
the whatever kan semua tak show up tak apa tapi caterer kalau tak show up wah
my mum will go crazy because the thing is that makanan apa kan ha orang datang tak ada makanan nak kasih apa maggi mee
ya macam lah
ya I mean um he he dia very professional lah professional dia tahu macam mana nak berbual dia tahu and dia tak ada macam menyakiti siapa-siapa di hati pun for ah because the reason is that my mum is under religious punya school studies so kalau
so kalau cikgu macam ada cikgu-cikgu ke ustazah-ustazah datang nanti my mum was like eh don't open like all these kind of song ah
ha so macam he understand like throughout truly lah everything semua dia faham semua so the was good
uh eventually the wedding turn out good and also caterer datang we got our photoshoot photographs semua
but eventually the only thing that we don't get back is yes kita punya video tak dapat balik so orang lain um tunjukkan video kat facebook after like what
two weeks kita sampai sekarang belum lagi tunjukkan video because we do not have the video ya we want to do again
yes correct then the things that bila I that's when I found out that macam
um actually I don't really care lah that's it's correct lah macam sedih kita tak dapat video tapi at that same time I say
video could be just a story then tapi I nak cerita I dengan you like forever punya cerita video so I say okay
I want to get my own video tapi sampai sekarang masih belum buat because my computer very slow
ya I know banyak tapi video um computer slow the things that all nak kena tunggu the computer baru datang baru boleh buat
ya the cuaca was nice because dia tak hujan tapi dia tak panas pun so it was just that perfect moment
but for me I have regret I have like a lot of regrets actually for the wedding um because that wedding kan um I like my wedding betul but
back then I would actually definitely go to orange ballroom orange ballroom punya wedding right is like terbaik ah pada I um shout to shah ibrahim he make it like macam it's like a hotel
tapi still macam tak hotel juga parking is the perfect place to park the car because apa ni kat mana eh
kan tanjong katong complex yes so that place was macam tanjong katong complex where dia punya
um what is called ya mm ya dia punya parking is open space it's there's lot of parking kalau tak ada parking pun you can still park at wisma you can still park at
hooga eh salah group punya side banyak tempat untuk you nak park secondly aircon
ya that time was like the aircon was best and then dia punya makanan and then when I ask my friend because um I think a lot of people already three of my friends already get married there semua cakap makan and everything is just cost like less eh
ya about thousand a thousand people also so it's like macam that is like one of the biggest regrets because that time it was my wedding I mean it was like macam if I was married on that time right then it'll be nice lah cuma one thing about bad about that place it's not bad lah I say macam
not that fantastic about that place is just that dia punya tempat nak tukar baju and everything mm
ah yes because the things that macam okay for
all malay wedding as what we know as apa kita tahu kan mesti nak kena berapa banyak kali
ya around two to three right uh some ours was three ya ours was three eh no the sanding was two and then the nikah was one but nikah was a day before
so macam kita kita macam wah get married and then ah one thing about ya that one is just that ah
and then dapat hotel semua my friend actually uh because of that it actually slow down the the wedding process lah like macam because wedding malay weddings like kelam-kabut nak mampus leh bukan bukan uh macam jauh ah ah macam
bila you dah you nak tukar baju kan lepas tu you nak kena pergi patah balik kat tempat sanding
sekali macam you nak kena naik kereta go to the hotel just to tukar baju and then go back there so macam ah traffic and then campur you nak kena make up semua and then nak kena pakai baju semua so eventually that one ah take process up to two to three hours eh
the hours eh maybe along the way do you figure at know criteria was amended to alah dah cukup datang
tak lah tak juga pasal kalau nak buat photoshoot tak ada time mesti orang nak ambil gambar lagi kan ha semua orang nak ambil gambar that time semua ha selit sikit
sikit ah sikit jer tapi that's the only macam if for orange ballroom ah but then if I would go I will still do at orange ballroom then who knows maybe our ten year anniversary kita buat wedding lagi
and another thing is inviting people that I don't like this is my mum punya dia akan suka okay about malay wedding eh
you will always invite those people who either you like or you don't like or terpaksa like
because these people are like somehow somewhat related to you I remember there's this one makcik when my mum actually invited her to our wedding she was like eh you got child ni you got child some more ah
walao I was like macam eh nak eh kelakar lah makcik ni
a lot of the the cousin after that right like after my first cousin usually dia orang cuma ingat yang my mum cuma ada my brother and sister my kakak lah
cause my brother my kakak is the only people who are like macam
terserlah I me and my adik kita orang macam relax ah kita orang relax chill lepak bro tak buat apa-apa semua kita relax tak macam
my sister and my brother ha kita memang low profile relax ah relax like like you juga kan you pun relax tak buat apa-apa juga macam
ya lah tapi that time uh
we did say to uh my sister did say back because my sister was there I wasn't there kalau I was there macam over
so confirm I dah gaduh dengan dia lah tapi dah tak uh tapi K what if K takpe next question uh just asking you what is the luckiest or like macam you rasa macam
um thank god that time one one thing is the cuaca kan cuaca cuaca was like perfect ah okay then another thing apa yang you suka pasal that wedding
the other guy I mean my friend punya
I feel like macam that is the most the best thing ah of my wedding the food was nice also sadly ya
it's not about tak boleh makan or can makan also it's all about like
picture perfect I don't know ah maybe maybe it's not something to regret now actually ah menyesal sekarang pun tak guna tapi
mm tak ha dah kahwin pun ha tapi um
talking about rewind also ya if can rewind this is all the things I want to do lah tapi macam
macam kalau tak then I I I I still okay so takpe okay so nevermind let's move to marriage life okay
lepas kita kahwin lepas kita kahwin I dapat tahu yang perangai macam mana I dapat tahu macam mana you punya cara you everything I learn throughout the five years
because okay but this is what my one of my makcik cakap auntie lisa lah she told me that
orang ketiga ke apa alhamdulillah I'm so happy I'm so thankful that there's no orang ketiga
it's almost six years already um we are not uh blessed with a child yet but no matter what I'm still blessed with uh being with you lah okay so um tapi kan I nak tanya you what was on your mind
okay uh bila you dah kahwin okay once you dah habis
all the nikah right and then um all the sanding semua dah habis kan and then outside then um kat dalam bilik dah makcik-makcik semua dah balik dah mandi dah siap semua nak tidur kan
but what was on your mind eh dalam otak you tu apa you fikir macam it was for me like I fikir macam eh aku dah kahwin lah seh
aku dah aku dah I'm like all these responsibilities macam fuh dah jatuh kat kat I lah then I rasa macam eh I dah kahwin eh like like really I dah kahwin eh I tak sangka I dah kahwin and then ah so I was like macam okay takpe lek even even like few days like after the wedding
when I want when I woke up right I can't believe there's someone there's a guy beside me I was like I actually about to shout there lepas tu macam oh wait wait wait kau dah kahwin
okay so that was like uh that but it wasn't a big thing yet ah ah but for you what what's on your mind bila
you bila all this dah habis kan and the sanding part semua dah habis what's on your mind from your like marriage kind of thing
ya then like because the thing is that uh okay regarding about the call right dia macam mana tau
because the thing is that kalau you call because where I'm living alone I don't have anything like to even as your mum also she be more worried like if like the father your father is he at home ke tak
ah not because um curang ke apa lah ha but it's more to like macam um like you pukul berapa nak balik I mean like worried tau worried uh you you also did because the thing is that
bila I dah jadi isteri
where are you tu semua and stuff like that then it's like also one another thing is that I'm alone at home anything that can happen like macam kalau malam alone not that good lah kan cause it's like macam
I can't say that the neighbourhood is actually quite good lah thank god we've got a good neighbourhood ah but no people like any tom dick or harry ke apa ke you call dia orang nak strike strike malam apa betul tak
ha so I tak suka lah kan
then um so another thing is like respect lah also then when you respect my decision of talking you I mean telling you ah bila eh you ni bila nak balik ni semua then you respond okay at least I know actually I just need a respond that's all
ya tapi there's the I mean mostly you like about that lah ah but one thing about him like you tak kasih I you kasih I bebas
kebebasan also so I rasa macam happy lah ha so ya that was why ya okay that was on your mind lah like responsibilities and stuff like that also right
okay so the next one is like what you enjoy on this marriage and everything what thing I enjoy right and I found out lah yang kita ni ada banyak kesamaan in terms of like movies
ya and then like macam movie macam
some movies of course they some movies that you don't like macam harry potter you don't like tapi um lord of the ring you like and then
err so macam okay lah give and take ah stuff like that uh then but then but the most thing that we enjoy
jap at that time you belum apa at least one time only but the thing is that when that day that time happened right
meticulous lah macam semua benda I mesti macam make sure that everything eh mesti macam
goes well lah uh because I punya orang tak macam itu tau I punya orang tak macam eh tak jadi pergi sini ah pasal ah due to this and that and this and that I rasa macam I rasa risau ha but I think that time
I I say to myself maybe there's a reason why I'm not supposed to go there but eventually on that day eh kita macam eh on that time we actually had fun eh ha better correct we we had even more because it was impromptu macam tak plan apa and lepas tu kita terus like uh okay just dive ah
kita pergi cameron and port dickson
duit ada so I macam okay I terjun jer ah ha so it was macam it was fun lah it was fun kita pergi honeymoon tu semua and then we get to know each other we eventually we get to know more about each other then uh travel then
uh then he he can drive well ha naik atas semua and then because that one also is my first time I went out to um holiday without my parents in my whole entire life
I have always travelled with my parents I never like travel alone ke pergi dengan kawan ke or pergi
dengan boyfriend apa tak pernah my my travel is usually just my parents so usually like
the hotel tickets semua kan orang lain dah siapkan dah
tapi kan ah but one thing is just like it's just fun lah tapi it's it's one thing like I feel like macam wah dah dah start into responsibility end up okay dah tahu macam mana nak book hotel tu semua lepas tu dah tak tak habis-habis stop tak asyik book hotel jer nak pergi holiday jer
actually ada banyak juga for bandung but ada tapi kita tak tak venture ke sana lah
I regret tak kumpul duit banyak-banyak lepas tu kahwin but then again I rasa this is still the right time because the thing is that
ah macam kita tak boleh buat macam uh and then um but then again after I dah berapa tahun yang I realised that
I shouldn't rely on people punya kind of marriage and my kind of marriage cause
I find that because I rasa kan the time I I
I macam suka ikut-ikut orang ah macam oh dia ni ada bag dior I pun nak bag ah yang I nak pun nak I I pun nak pergi makan kat sini makan kat cafe ni semua but then after awhile then I realise
I think it's not supposed to be our kind of wedding lah our wedding supposed to be like macam our kind of marriage is supposed to be something that is just us
like a lot of my friends success friends so one thing about them is that that dia orang suka um
cause of course I know I got lot of flaws also and hey you jangan cakap you pun tak ada flaws gitu eh ha tapi macam like
you you got any regrets of the marriage itself like for example kan macam kalau dulu you tahu kalau before kahwin kan uh kalau kalau tak kalau you kahwin you can play endless car ke apa kan freedom yes you are the freedom to do whatever you want to meet your friends also have can anything but um
after marriage maybe you find like macam oh nak kena layan dia ni lah nak nak kena pergi sini nak pergi sana I cannot do my stuff and stuff like that do you have any regrets ah
but do you have any regrets of marriage not wedding oh macam sekarang ha macam for me kan I tak regret
okay because I I'm okay with marriage but uh macam being
but I know that there's certain things that I cannot do when I'm married ah ah but one thing about you you don't you don't let macam ah give me to kongkong you know macam like
I cannot do this I cannot do this I cannot do that kan ha tapi you kasih I freedom of what to do like for example even this uh recording screen ke apa ke
some people will find it macam the guys don't let like like you know they don't let the wife do this and stuff like that some
find that if the the lady wanted to do business or what the guy don't give ha so macam it's a lot of things like like the guys don't really macam into it lah
ha cakap nanti berselerak lah apa lah
ya kemas tu tapi macam tak boleh macam marah lah kan so so eventually macam not all guys can actually accept this ah so actually one thing I I happy lah I dapat kahwin dengan you so I happy that this thing doesn't occur to me much
which I find it macam funny ah because that time I wasn't planning mah to get married so after get married this guy wasn't like really thinking eh this guy okay or not ha
I I tak boleh seh kalau you cheat I cannot like if you cheat like
ha if you do have another girl outside or what then um that was one of my biggest fear lah I have I don't have like small small fear but then macam that one I think that if that happen terus cut ah
ah and also pukul lah but then I there wasn't any hit or anything ah I'm I'm still as fluffy as possible but then I'm not a bruises or anything lah uh so um okay for you is there any biggest fear about this marriage
uh like for example anything ah that you think like ada ke apa biggest fear lah
some in-laws lah kalau there is I is not pretty and the in-laws don't accept which is to me macam I I that's one of my fear like when I get to know your mum ke apa and then your mum don't like me akan cakap eh asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni sia eh sorry sorry I didn't your mum won't say like that
anyway like eh asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni ha dah lah gemuk tak lawa tu semua but then it's like
not like that ah your your parents are not like that ya they are very welcoming and they are and we actually did slept before waiting out we did actually um uh apa ni tinggal kat rumah mak mertua so we were like
featuring guest lah kalau you nak uh
six years and then macam kalau you want to have another what what what is your no request lah what is your future plans for the next four years before we step into that ten year punya anniversary ya
ha to join us apa semua tu so I wish that kita our financial also is doing good and everything and then um healthier family and also um slimmer but until now also dah five years also still not slim so
ya lah takde lah just just saying only
a maritime in logistics I think there they have actually two course so they have a maritime law and actually and maritime logistic so I'm think I'm having interest in the logistics so macam and I feel that lagi senang ah
ya but it's a more of a countryside punya tempat mm so okay lah there's no distractions I think
actually is a really a good job because like dekat that time intern tempat intern aku bourbon
kau tahu tak admin earn berapa
ya no because I think you see industry mana lah like I feel like kalau kau should search in
maritime punya admin cause they don't go they don't go on board
they just duduk office and just um
friend is admin dekat maritime that time dekat bourbon so she earn two point five but then after after the is ready is one point nine ya correct
under law punya admin
two points seven cause she got a lot of experience no no need you just admin macam registration orang nak masuk
those work that people don't want to do macam filing and stuff
pasal sia
I have still have time to march ah to think about it to I mean to go bank also to minta loan study loon and stuff
like a news so macam like my previous intern might cause I'm still keeping contact them one of the managers kena buang sia
retrenched macam because the economy was busted sia
but ya because aku like from a project I've been working with him so he's the one who actually ya guide me but now they retrench him macam wah
there's a will there's a way betul

president of the france kat paris itu like you know dia kata apa like recently dia kata like islam is the region is the problem

K the first movie that we watched was apa eh
err oh no yesterday yesterday night semalam yang kita tengok cerita um what was the title
dia macam the oriental express um
what was it eh situ apa ah sebelum the knives out okay jap before that I just wanted to say about the knives out lah okay
it's kinda okay even though err aku tidur lepas tu but I can somehow see that it's a good movie because it actually sedikit banyak macam the oriental express
it's about uh a person being murdered orang kena bunuh and then macam there's a lot but whereas in the oriental express there were twelve people were being suspect and twelve of them were all the murderers that's why the other that's why it was being stabbed twelve times lah kan
but then in this case dalam the oriental err apa the knives out err dia pasal about err dia punya apa this guy umur dia lapan puluh lima tahun eh dia baru sambut dia punya birthday yang lapan puluh lima tahun lepas tu lah dia kena um dia orang assume dia kena bunuh lah
so after that aku tak tahu apa jadi
but you told me that there was satu orang there's a one suspect right ada satu orang kena suspect so ya
this kind of err story apa err story that story line is is good lah I like ah kind of like ya I'm gonna watch it again later
semalam penat babe
um before that what did we watch eh sebelum tu apa kita tengok
you can't have more than one spell ya because aku rasa because one of them err jatuh hati dengan um dia punya apa classmate dia ya
kawan sekolah dia so dia actually dah buat because there's a bully eh actually this guy is a bully so
ya what they did was um dia orang semua spell a cast on him to turn him into good guy and eventually he did lah tapi sayang ya lepas tu yang the one that fall in love with him actually had another err spell cast on him so lepas tu tahu tahu besok dia dah mati
not so super natural sangat juga it still err ya it's true lah
mm tadi apa lagi kita tengok kita tengok oh the nun we watched the nun
aku rasa cerita conjuring is the best horror movie lah
it's it's kind of err thrilling for me memang ah aku pun penakut tapi
lagi pun tengah COVID kan so macam apa lagi cerita kau pergi tengok
for me aku rasa aku punya favourite movie one of it is err mamma mia
my my ah so it's it's a nice movie lah aku addicted to it lah it's very nice lah
annabelle ya dia kena menang ah
I like the one that you showed me yang cerita unhinged tu oh that one you guys have to watch man
banyak emosi you know emosi tertekan leh aduh that's like ya
betul mm
actually aku tak expect ah
and then when and then when it came to a part whereby she started to horn and then you said that okay this is where you will begin okay then I'm like okay I thought he's gonna be like macam stalk her all the way just focusing on her but no she he actually went way beyond and
apa err attacking the family members and all the stuff
wah that's tu seram eh tu kalau kat singapore aku rasa just err
orang tumbuk-menumbuk punya eh
daripada kena road rage
so lepas tu it falls on a saturday and then his wife was supposed to follow him but then the wife actually got invite invitation to err the wife actually is a bake caterer lah
um she was invited to do catering for her event and she's an artist photographer lah begitu so she owns that a big err art gallery eh so lepas tu
err bila dia kata I ah can't follow he she can't follow him to the reunion for this saturday
and then lepas tu uh the guy actually got um connected back with dia punya ex-girlfriend ex-girlfriend back in the college and then the ex-girlfriend also texted him saying that um my husband is not coming then
err I think this guy tak nak ada any connection ah so he just you know
okay I just say this guy A lah eh I forgot the name so this guy A dah pergi dekat reunion dia so he saw his ex-girlfriend
and then it came to a point where the girl the ex-girlfriend actually keep on macam harassing him in a way like kasi uh gambar yang dia tengah pakai sexy lah yang dia tengah apa err ah seducing in a way so two months later
err what what was there sekali dia nampak apa gambar-gambar dia macam nampak gambar familiar kat gallery dia gambar-gambar dia is
all the pictures of him having sex with the ex tapi gambar tak tunjuk
so the picture dia punya face wasn't shown lah so he suspects suspected dia like that maybe this his girlfriend of his is err you know revenging him back tapi tak tahu pasal apa
sampai masanya the woman at the err wife get to know that you know um
so lepas tu dah habis he err the wife somehow got kidnapped
he actually got a try to find for his wife and then he actually stream live dekat dia punya ah social media when he got caught up with dia punya friend bila dia dah kidnap dia punya wife
yang ah this this this district attorney person dia put
sudah dapat tahu and then um
so ya she was she was ni ah she was ah
because he was this close to finding out who actually was behind all this thing and she was pang she was dead
yes so kalau within five minutes dia tak tak bagus tak best
kau lupakan sahaja lah don't try to convince us in watching now
eh tapi ada tapi ada trailer pun doesn't really catch our attention it's like macam ah boring apa
ya ya nasi ambeng
actually it's sedap lah quite quite err nice lah
dia ada consists of uh ayam lemak apa ayam lemak cili padi begedil paru sayur tomato carrot sambal goreng ya it's quite nice lah
so we have been covering ourselves with blankets selimut selimut ya so
so pergi oh yesterday we went to um
where did we go botanical garden but we didn't get to hike banyak sangat pasal hujan hujan dia macam stop lepas tu hujan stop lepas tu adakalanya lepas tu hujan lebat so macam kita tak dapat nak err
habiskan kita punya hiking lah macam selama ni kita habiskan dalam kita will always habiskan dalam ten kilometre twelve kilometres tapi kita tak dapat buat semalam
aku pun macam ya what if lah macam kau tak fikir ke macam kalau komodo tu macam jump dekat kau tiba-tiba ke tahu macam crocodile
macam dia tengah senyap-senyap lepas tu bila lepas tu you know how tall crocodile are right so like macam when they were
it's like macam siala kalau manusia it's like apa
five people tall like that macam gitu ya
and then kita akan dapat news seorang kanak-kanak berumur
dimakan oleh sebuah eh seekor buaya
aku eh aku tak berapa takut sangat lah dengan crocodile semua ah
ah itu lah kalau dia jump kita elak kita elak kita ikut macam P ramlee boleh settle
ramai juga semalam eh yang berumur-berumur jalan-jalan semua
I think pulau ubin not so bad macritchie is like wah kaki aku sakit eh
dia punya jalan dia is so narrow that aku
ya when I went back island wow my leg kasi pain
it's like aku tengah jalan K depan and she was at the back and then there was this noise like you know if monkey were fighting K if you don't know how monkey fight or how it sounds like you go and YouTube it okay so it was a very loud noise and she actually just take her hand and just pull my neck like
a'ah seh it's like boleh gigit engkau sampai cedera parah oh kau tahu tak
monyet business
the older one is like macam
dia macam sign kau ah dia kata jangan bilang dia jangan bilang dia
ah pasal kau dah pekik nama aku
next kalau ada next word coming from your mouth he's going to come at you
takde air because okay that time eh bila aku pergi bali kan then lepas tu they have these tourist place whereby kau boleh beli kau boleh beli banana and it's like the kecil-kecil banana in a bunch
for like two dollars so lepas tu kau boleh feed the banana the banana pulak kau boleh feed
kau boleh feed the monkeys there lah and there were a lot of monkeys there where tapi kat situ ada rangers lah
there's this one monkey aku rasa maybe dia macam hmm primary school monkey
dia tak besar dia tak kecil ah he's not an adult he's not a child so probably maybe it's like err teenager so this monkey actually came to me and then he just snatch this banana from me so lepas tu I think the banana was rotten
so dia buka he peel peel peel peel
I was shocked I was like eh ini biadap eh like I paid because it was so I was so err interested I mean I was so having I was so much having fun
so I kept buying the bananas like up to ten dollars dah so kau imagine ya aku beli two dollar two dollar two dollar so I kept buying and then I buy lepas tu
aku dah kasi kat semua monyet and the monkeys will be like macam dia tak ada datang kat engkau macam simpati punya macam kucing takde eh dia tak nak engkau turun dia jump on you and jump on your head or your body there's like three monkeys four monkeys on me
wanted that banana so I gave it ya gave it gave it gave it then after that satu tonyoh kepala aku okay like after he ate the banana he actually just like
so err aku takut ah aku tak marah lah kalau aku marah dia sekali dia bawa the gang ah mana tahu dia faham bahasa aku so
so bila so that time bila aku tengah jalan-jalan then there's this one ang moh ada this orang putih mat salleh lah dia
I think she was trying to play with the monkey but the rangers suruh kita dah kita masuk kita semua orang masuk dia dah cakap don't try to be funny lah kalau ada
uh grab your banana grab banana lah kalau dia um you know you don't like macam main-main dengan dia lah so aku rasa this orang putih main-main dengan dia so he actually wanted to bite her ears
aku rasa dia angry ah or aggressive ah because dia main-main the rangers tu dah kata jangan main-main so so he actually wanted to bite the ears ah so dah macam just
not really that deep bite lah sort of one bite so the ah the caucasian girl was at shock ah dia pekik and in the ranger was like I think they had this macam
kayu ke apa aku tak tahu ah I don't know what's that lah so he just like macam whack it so that the monkey will go away
aku tak tahu ah that is that is because they are rangers they know their monkeys aiyo
ah tahu tak apa ah nanti dia panggil dia punya gang lagi ah tak payah lah terima kasih sudah
aku rather deal with one monkey than a lot of monkeys
okay maybe ostrich farm is one another one is yang dekat mana eh
I mean they they don't really macam
they don't really macam
um ya malaysia ostrich aku rasa I felt regretful that we didn't get to feed the kangaroo when we were in australia
I have holidays in november and december right so you know I always have this macam
so aku just want to ask like do you prefer to work at home or do you prefer to go to your physical workplace
so ya that's that's that's our life lah eh kita hopefully things get better hopefully things um
okay lah I don't like that you know we take things we take life for granted we thought that you know you could travel as much as we can we could go out as much as we can you know but when this kind of thing happen we will like macam
alamak tak boleh buat tu tak boleh buat ni
we can't get to travel as much we can't um and then when we now we used to have like gathering kita ada gathering we used to like just book chalet and invite you know like what twenty thirty forty people and then birthday celebration
we will invite people over but now is like macam
orang lagi banyak yang hush hush you know coming in to celebrate birthday and all those stuff
aku rasa vendor pun kesian juga lah it's like you know all these err thing macam numbers restricted numbers and all those stuff that is coming from the government right so when pengantin dah buat bayaran for certain for certain pax eh
and then the pengantin okay lah kalau aku pun aku pun rasa macam I just wasted my money you know like few thousand dollars and then now the numbers is like that so and then vendors pun
kesian juga lah like macam aku dia also want to earn a living you see so there was a point whereby there's err apa err miscommunication between the pengantin and vendor like asking for refund and all those stuff like even vendor also didn't know that this thing will happen
and it wasn't even in the contract so some of them that I heard is like blaming the vendor you know of not giving me back tak highlight dengan duit lah you know and those stuff but
aku rasa it's it has it has to be um
communicate both face sekali lah
like pengantin pun tak expect numbers will drop vendor pun tak expect numbers will drop so you know it's only fair that vendor err apa err maybe gantikan dengan something or the pengantin kurangkan something so that you know both will be happy about it lah
ya pasar basah ya
mengeteh lah kopi lah so
I think just old old songs or cerita-cerita lama ya atau pun err they will go to me watch and you know err um buka daripada handphone apps then buka YouTube ah apa
I also err apa tu download err yang apps untuk watch movie ya so wherever he can scroll he scroll ya
ya ya my mum actually downloaded like malaysia punya astro ria those stuff you know lepas tu dia orang tengok ya so
ho ho aku tak kenal
ah mm ah kita ada WhatsApp
tak tak tahu tak tahu tak tahu siapa dia lah tak tahu dia siapa tapi ini macam kali kedua kita kena buat lagi kan pasal buat salah ah jadi
lepas tu dia tak ada clapping
dia macam err conjuring ah dia main clapping dekat dalam almari macam gitu ah jadi
so dia macam ya dia macam gitu ah sekejap dengar sekejap dia tak dengar so aku tak tahu apa masalahnya masalahnya ke dengan apps ke dengan err recording ke aku tak tahu apa masalah dia lah
dia suruh bual dia suruh bual like daily dia suruh berbual just macam daily macam kita berbual so sekarang ni kita bual macam daily ah macam berbual K jadi aku tak tahu kalau kita terlebih melayu atau pun kita terlebih orang putih aku tak tahu jadi
aku tak tahu aku dah tanya macam mana I justify tapi tak ada jawapan so dia kata bual macam biasa kau bual lah macam biasa sekarang
betul betul I'm told
eh mahu dapat dua puluh lima lagi dua minggu
jadi macam gitu lah
ah betul tapi mm
kita orang yang baik lah jadi kita tak ya
enam puluh dot dot kosong lima okay
mmhmm jadi okay apa kata-kata terakhir kau sebelum kau
and then because of that dia upset mengamuk
but we always also carry what angkat jer pe
oh ya makcik seth ya so apparently seh couldn't do work properly ya and then and then got send out and then got send away that's why we wanted to came out why barang-barang semua tak betul kan
ah I mean if you really want you can but I think dia masih qualify lah
she's married what ya but she's she's married kan so kalau dia married but the husband is is B
so dia boleh declare berapa banyak dia nak apa you cannot
in which even if no matter what amount she puts because for us it's below five hundred kasi dia susah report to company
no but she going to class A so mama said will be like not so busy so most probably since dia ah
dia layan orang punya karenah ya
mama bear tak datang mama bear tak datang niari
tan sri ada tan sri mm

clement leave yes and then darlene tak ada
colin tak ada colin he's on leave also no no no not colin siapa tu no thomas
for the company he volunteered kena kena volunteered lah
no I was through home then okay lah cause my wife kerja malam today
seven thirty so kira since I'm not going to see her tonight you see so just make it one day and then we just spend the whole day together
did my bookings for my staycation pan pac because my friend dia celebrating
no because my friend did err is doing ah his daughter's birthday party kat situ like the same one I did for my son ya so like eh like he's some relative also like staying over lah they actually asked us to I think just they book dua bilik back to back because the the room can actually you know you book it together
the rooms actually always separate there's outside door yang you boleh tutup then you can remove the bilik macam besar so that's what I did during combined but I think they are doing something like that actually they just said to just sleepover
no lah then ask us to stay over for dua malam mesti dia ada ya so we so we booked a room on the twenty first twenty second monday tuesday ya the celebration is on sunday so sunday stay over then monday morning we check in
early check in ah I've been there before no no the pools were but dia limited so you need to book when you're there lah so basically ah I want to go to the pool do you have any like
so ada kitchenette ada apa no no I don't know that's my friend
endorse then present it on saturday tu saturday ya cause saturday we got video shoot with suhaimi yusof

ya something like no dia punya urat hati dia putus
sedih kan
it's only like what time tu
dua belas eh tiga belas
his parents used to stay two ah levels up from my rumah lama in west coast
so in a way I think we we were like we were so called growing up playing together when younger after that we went our own ways then dah tak apparently we meet back in the same school so that's why I know the whole family so the brother passed away one year after
I don't really need I mean sometimes I envy tau orang yang macam they got friends basically hang out with school friends but for me I don't because actually after my O-levels after so I just went my own ways then just like did my ya cause I wasn't really that close to my secondary school friends
even my friends also okay lah last time we were closed always hang out but then now like those around my batch and stuff everyone is like doing their own things so we like so we like one down do our own stuff if we meet up we meet up because of whatever reason on that day my friend's father passed away then macam like jumpa gitu jer lah like you know

oh my god I'm so glad sia aku aku apa ever since aku got retrenched tu aku cakap dengan laki aku err like we have this issues lah financial issues lah they say don't worry lah later maybe I can get my bonus whatever since like no whatever we plan ahead
we cannot include bonuses or semua tu tak boleh let's just take it as that thing tak ada ya you just depend on your that one only your your monthly salary
that's all because cannot lah because if you think of something that haven't come sekali betul-betul tak ada ah macam sekarang ni bonus tak ada
I don't know I I talk to my kids so err apa tu
we we talk about like okay now that we have only one person working kan so aku tak aku tak boleh ah selalu keluar makan ke apa benda but alhamdulillah
my expending maybe might over spending I stop I don't have so whatever allowances I have is err strictly untuk bayar bill mm dengan bayar apa-apa lah macam dia punya ngaji ke apa benda tu semua then err kereta aku tak bayar lagi that that time kereta is my responsibility so kereta semua dia dia yang bayar sekarang and then ah he take only lah that's that's why he he he drive to work also which is good lah because now raining season I I prefer him to drive then
masih ah motor tu takde don't need to pay already so it it it's has no financial burden lah ah it's just petrol only so no financial burden to me is fine you know we can keep it
actually tak ya at at first I I I I was thinking about ya lah financially we are still quite a burden but after that I was like I have to stop worrying ah you know
ah the break times that is like already given like when you are going to work you can just grab breakfast anywhere kau pergi kerja then after that if it's lunch break ah ya lah is lunch break ah nobody is working what semua orang nak keluar makan lunch then after that it's the end of the day of the work day kau balik
I think I eat like what dinner pukul lapan I didn't eat breakfast my breakfast is coffee
then after that aku lupa nak makan
eh jemput minum so my breakfast is just coffee so laki aku cakap you have to look after your health is not that I do not want to look after my health is really tak ada masa ya
dorangnya buku sekolah lah lah buku madrasah lah apa benda nak kena beli
dah sec four hairi ah secondary ah
that's the first choice ya second choice is bukit panjang actually dia punya
dia punya aggregate is ah
in between err normal academic and express he can go to express but if you want to go to an express class he have to go to the the sekolah yang
yang tak best sikit lah
like teck whye secondary which we don't kita tak nak that's the only school that is nearby us that we never choose
laki aku tak suka lah dia punya um
ah ya so the neighbourhood dia tak suka jadi dia cakap cannot other school boleh dapat normal academic pun takpe tapi tak boleh
any school lah any school that we choose tu boleh
pasal sekolah eh tak pasal kau punya kerja eh actually dia dah macam dah branch out dah
eh tapi aku tak faham ah kau punya kerja buat apa
jual besi dah dia punya sales really drop ah
kerja kau ni macam mak mertua aku ah
kau jual besi mak mertua aku ah mak mertua aku jual itu ah ya
right not enough experience lah tu
but your work wise memang dah
kau tak boleh function ah how to function
macam lyn ah sama
asam orh kunyit ah but tapi kunyit hidup ah jangan pakai kunyit powder
kunyit hidup aku baru buat aku aku aku blend ah ah I blend kunyit
and then I put in one one container then I blend ginger put in one container so anytime you want to drink like err ginger lemon ke apa kan mm then you just take lah
letak air panas letak lemon letak honey habis cerita
to me deep station err dia punya tu terlalu
ya because dia letak garlic juga apa right
the lemon grass no dia dia macam blend benda untuk masak kau faham ah tu yang pada aku macam tak tak best
aku ya I always mix with water then I just drink it as a shot
that one is for what buat bangun pagi jadi perut kempis
you see ah that is the old people thinking you know if you watch if you watch the err those yang health punya shows kan the health shows yang melayu punya tau
terus cakap eh this one is all
it doesn't matter minum air sejuk ke tidak it does not affect your system
so macam aku aku kan ada yang that package that time err urut kat tempat err tempat cina punya
urut ah then dia urut-urut aku dia cakap oh you shouldn't be drinking too much err cold water your inside ah sorry china kan china women so dia cakap your inside is very wet aku dah ketawa of course lah my inside very wet kan darah kalau dry I die already your inside is very wet
aku tak faham apa maksud dia very wet
but then dia nak cakap aku punya tu sejuk ke apa system aku sejuk ke aku pun tak tahu I think it ya lah I think is a problem ah because aku kadang-kadang macam minum air sejuk banyak sangat kan kaki aku sakit seh
well haus nyah
aku tengah menyusu haus tau
serious lah kalau dah artiste mesti lah better
ya you add in that one lah like those floral floral things you know like the chrysanthemum ke bunga rose ke the dried rose ah they say is good for complexion
ah can ah it's easy it's easy to get what anywhere just add in aje tak payah letak gula it's just to flavour your your air
semua masuk gasak ah
tu ah kan cakap mak-mak ni berbual ada jer daripada satu topic branch out
kalau betul dapat is fifty dollars fifty
okay lah buat
macam laki aku buat ah that time aku tak tahu eh so one of the years birthday aku dia kasi aku ni
ni lah ni apple apa ni apple pay ah
aku tak tahu pasal that time kita baru masing-masing masih kerja like still very new kind
experiment kena kasi darah
ah tapi dia kasi darah I think a lot ah then have to come like couple of times ah so
sumpah aku tak tahu nyah so he say because of that then they pay me to be the experiment punya person so the money I get I buy this one lah wah sweet lah sangat touched touched lah banyak-banyak
lama anak aku masih kecil lagi dua-dua aku masih belum ada hasif masih tak ada
eh dia takut jarum ah aku tu yang aku hairan
for all my pregnancies the man have to come to to take their blood or whatever right dia takut gila jarum kecil macam gitu pun dia takut huh the err they check blood right
mother and father punya blood or something ya ya ya hmm
even like at work if he has to do the um flu jabs right he always decline then I say why it's err it's compulsory he's like no it's it's not it's not compulsory so that's why I always reject uh huh anyway dia cakap anyway dia berbual dengan dia punya nurse um the nurse told me not all flu jabs are
what's that word no no no not murah it's free what they they already have to take it not all flu jabs are effective
because the certain flu jabs are for certain types of flu string so sometimes you can you can take the flu jab already and then the next few months you have flu which but it is cause by different string ah dia tak effective jadi dia cakap if not effective what for I take don't need to take ah
siao because to me to me pada aku you should take it because you are facing all these people all the prisoners all the visitors coming in and out test ya took twice
actually nowadays dulu aku aku dulu macam aku gung-ho ah tak takut tapi lepas tu ah
sensitive makin takut
kalah bising ah
sekarang dia dah start jalan kan jadi rumah aku berselerak ah
ye lah
I don't mind berselerak sometimes but
diri kau sendiri lah
I know lah it's good but you see ah I'm I'm dealing with different cases already macam kau aku rasa ian is very well behaved
I have all the phases that's the problem that's why I aku macam stressed because I have one boy I have one eh actually ah this conversation do we need to speak singlish or not
no need eh nevermind ah
asalkan ada dua-dua lah mixed
hairi dia susah nak dengar cakap aku kadang-kadang and he is very defensive and he is going into the teen phase okay I have aira who is in primary school but because she's a girl and she is going through
hopefully soon belum seh she ask she ask me you know ibu when am I going to get my period five already primary six
dey kau sec one eh sec two ke sec one I know you're the last one you know when but if you follow genes lah aku primary three
dia dia dia aku punya marker dia kalau dah start dah start kan chocolate lah ah that day she start craving for chocolate stuff or sweet stuff want to go mcdonald's then he will ask me are you going to get your period already so ya I think so dia aku punya marker every month
nanti kadang-kadang dia mood swing aku tak mood swing aku okay jer lepas tu nanti dia macam nanti dia mengamuk mengamuk mengamuk lepas tu dia dah mengamuk nanti dia cakap dengan aku are you going to get your period ah tapi after that I'll get it lah he's my marker first then after that I will get it nanti dia okay kelakar kan ya but but after that will be ah ye sejiwa lah sangat ya I think we sync already
ya so I have aira then I have hasif who is coming into primary school level and he talks so much and because he has the influences from dia punya brother and sister jadi dia punya perbualan tak macam budak primary school punya perbualan macam elly masih boleh berbual cute cute
cute lah masih cute lah juga hasif tak tau dia berbual macam orang besar dia dah macam more naggy now maybe because I'm naggy or his brother is naggy lepas tu dia and then he he like
abang why you never wait for me abang can you quickly do this kalau kalau aku ada macam abang you never clear the litter bukan aku yang suruh tau dia yang suruh
in a way lah tapi nanti abang dia complain nanti macam kadang-kadang laki aku cakap tanya aku whether I'm okay or not aku I have to tell him the truth ah I'm not okay
there's once I actually complain to him kalau aku punya kerja eh senang tau kau bangun pagi kau cium anak happy semua anak-anak tengah happy apa tanya okay okay I see you later ah then after that bila kau balik you attend your stuff already outside you go to the gym you come home it's dinner time the kids happy then it's already bedtime so you so so your time with them is like just it's only like one two hours ah it's bed time already finish then it's my time with you ah but in the middle
you you don't need to settle their breakfast you don't have to settle their lunch you don't have to settle their dinner ah then you don't see ya me instructing them eh pergi mandi lah sekarang dari pukul berapa kena solat kena ni kena gitu ni semua tolong ibu oh my god
alah camera tu camera tu for show jer bukannya pakai pun bila aku tinggalkan budak-budak sorang-sorang kat rumah
then aku penat tau aku cakap dengan dia kau balik kau nampak semua dah settle tau
except for sometimes berselerak which I will I will always like okay okay clean up clean up
pasal aku tak nak dia stressed ah kononnya macam dah dah tempat kerja is so difficult already then you come home and then you see more mess and you get fed up you know
anything ah so like because I have cats right jadi I have no choice in the morning first thing in the morning I have to do is vacuum then after that I mop
by the time tak payah tak payah tunggu satu tak sampai tunggu tiga jam lah satu dua jam jer kau nampak bulu semua bergerak
I have to do it jadi aku vacuum again
but I can't because I have a I have a err a crawling toddler you know abeh aku tak suka jadi aku kena if I shave them ah
tak lah cepat lah nanti grow balik ah ah
kena shave again aku shave sendiri lah mana ada kena bayar apa benda
shave sembarang
ah initially kita shave sembarang a'ah petak-petak lah gasak ah then after that macam initially macam kita nak eh let's let's try to to maintain dorang punya fur so we use the the the head whatever lah then in the end ah tak kuasa lah go down to zero shave aje semua terus nampak macam ah nampak macam biasa balik
aku punya ni banyak message ah macam banyak sangat itu ah messages coming to my phone
help apa
condition rumah aku
takde there's no way lah I the only way is for me to lazy parenting lah the robot I have I have it no it works the thing is aku
we were observing the robot tau kita cakap kesian robot ni pasal dia banyak benda yang dia kena manoeuvre macam kalau aku jadi robot kan aku macam like alamak meja alamak ada child punya benda alamak mainan no and and that's how dia macam macam confused ah so the best the best thing ah when I was using it the best was when it is in the kitchen cause it is easy I do not know where to park it ya it's a huge one
kita beli second hand aku punya benda takde lah first hand semua second hand
I called it lazy parenting lah I just order them about macam ayra sekarang dia dah pandai
belakang a'ah lah
kelabu asap ya granite
actually rumah aku dah dah takde is not in sync already all the stuff
it's all dah no ah the island I push there already because I don't I don't bake any more mah ya ya pasal aku dah tak bake jadi aku letak jer lah tolak ke tepi dulu so I have space to move around in the kitchen
then how yang tu kau tak pergi yang block two one eight tu why jauh daripada apa
I think so ya because sometimes err aku punya neighbour ni dia sekolah dekat kranji juga kadang-kadang dia balik lambat dia tak naik three zero seven dia ambil lagi satu bus and then it drop behind aku tak tahu
rumah jannah
aku nampak rumah orang jer view apa
cause macam those rumah-rumah yang baru kan the layout ya the the the layout is funny and then like if you're opening you open the window to a to another window that kind of thing aku macam like ya exactly pasal tu pasal we say resale the best that's why resale punya prices is still
pasal that time aku tanya ah naz rumah aku punya two years two years ya
ya means kalau dah naik market if I want to buy is really higher already right now that time the the the median
jauh ah aku dah aku dah kat sini dah bagus tau cause of a southview kalau aku nak ada rumah dekat sini aku nak block sana nampak hari-hari aku pandang block sana block mak mertua aku block sebelah situ mak mertua aku nya block macam block aku dia ada rumah empat bilik dekat situ ada ada dengan yes correct then yang kat hujung-hujung is ada tapi mahal
ya this location quite difficult that time ada yang block opposite opposite my house block two zero four dia jual dia punya
then dia jual murah because the the owner and he is selling on his own
then I was thinking maybe I should just go for it lah since I'm not working right then after that we worried about the financial later gila nasib baik ya I was thinking of that ah
ya I was thinking you know like eh this is the best time you know yang let's just do it lah nanti kita boleh fikir cause right now also I'm still paying for for the house using my what
not not not tapping into his so okay apa
dia bayar dia punya part is lapan ratus aku punya part lima ratus
hmm but kalau kita ambil rumah mesti nak kena increase but then again you'll be difficult lah cause if I prolong like this no job no contribution and then it's going to be lesser and lesser bila aku nak itu
chey sudah lah
kejap jer then lepas tu nanti lepak nanti aku dah kasi makan nanti semua lepak
tak aku aku nak need bigger space but then aku pun fikir bigger space means we probably buy more things
just be happy jer lah dengan apa dengan space yang aku ada because most of the time pun kita semua lepak dekat luar bukan lepak dalam bilik
three is just enough in in in apa in the end pun kita plan at this moment ah because I don't know how to fit three kids in three boys into one room
aira yang tu yang tak she volunteered she say nevermind hafis sleep with me
hmm because dia sorang jer apa yang she gets everything what her own her own like double girls lah ah but because I was thinking also because their age gap is very very far hmm that's why she don't mind that hafis sleep with her
they are all sleeping together still tilam tilam kau tu very useful bila aku cakap dengan anak-anak aku aku nak buang ni ni katil korang kena pakai katil dah beli mahal-mahal
so she sleep on her own tilam kat bawah ada dua tilam
ya in a way lah so gasak korang lor
tu dah start nak berkawan dengan perempuan camne
jap eh aku punya sini tak tak tak tak tak mute ke
kita berbual habis tu aku tak mute aku punya itu
ah takde pun
la ilaha illallah tak tahu lah
apa-apa ah
satu setengah ah mm mm
ya exactly cuma masalahnya is the noise from the background aje hopefully it doesn't affect so much lah exactly habis-tu pula telefon aku aku tak tahu
but that's the thing you see our aku tengah pasal bila first time aku nampak this thing kan aku macam like
tadi kita tadi kita dah macam cakap kan pasal ni aku cakap aku nak berbual dengan laki aku tapi laki aku cakap ya I don't speak malay which is true lah he no oh my god tak aku jer mixed mixed aku sorang jer yang boleh berbual dengan korang melayu fasih no problem takde masalah langsung kalau nak kasi aku apa kalau kau nak aku berbual apa tu chey berbual melayu yang yang no lah I mean like using proper malay words also I think I can try
a'ah tu lah aku pun rasa macam gitu eh cakap pasal banyak english banyak melayu kelmarin aku kena interview that was on wednesday no on tuesday
so mendaki nak interview aku so mendaki cakap dengan aku eh hasif ni kan in every of his class pasal hasif kan ambil yang mendaki nya classes which is free right ah in every of his class dia actually very outspoken pandai berbual ah you hantar dia untuk itu eh untuk preschool tak cakap ya dia pernah start daripada preschool lah start daripada play group dia cakap eh how about your other children aku cakap oh ya my eldest tu memang ah daripada nursery ah all the way sampai kindergarten oh kita tengah cari families lah yang hantar anak-anak gi ah preschool kita nak interview you boleh tak
okay jer aku aku sembarang gasak lah tak lah dia nak kasi aku voucher tak kesah lah aku tak kesah if it if it helps the community apa salahnya then dia cakap ya so kebetulan kau ingat tak yang there's one day yang aku hantar korang satu article a lot of malay families tak hantar so it's on conjunction with that kiranya dorang nak interview aku tu kan
to create awareness that how macam mana ah sekolah ah for preschool kan for preschoolers it's good to send kids err to preschool to
you know permulaan from all the different cases lah
ya ramai a lot so bila aku berbual dengan so yang datang tu is a mendaki person and then there's this person I do not know I think she is err from
yang err
maybe from the preschool punya aku tak tahu lah okay lagi satu rupanya dia berita harian yang interview aku tu it's from berita harian so aku tanya actually kenapa you nak interview I pasal the preschoolers ah cause is it because of this article that I read err budak-budak ah apa bangsa melayu tak itu
aku cakap ah ah tak dorang tak hantar then I say kenapa err what's the reason you tahu tak apa dia punya reason dia cakap dorang cakap is not necessary
jadi dorang hantar K one K two jer huh
aku cakap lah eh itu zaman mak bapa kita seh zaman mak bapa kita ye lah kita hantar K one K two jer ah tapi sekarang I think
the system dah berubah
if you send to the government punya the punya dorang memang tak ada childcare service apa it's only a few hours everyday lain lah kalau dorang ambil ambil yang macam ah macam aku punya is private so they have a childcare service from seven to seven
so pada aku macam like apa seh pada aku like why would you say it is not necessary pada that's that's where the interview ya that's why we need to interview jadi kita nak tahu apa pandangan you bila you ah decided to hantar lah anak you pergi preschool
that's where then then I ask lah this interview going to be in malay or english eh abeh dia cakap in malay lah aku cakap my malay is also tak strong sangat mm kita mixed mixed boleh cakap ah boleh ah so kita berbual
the dia punya question was very legit ah like macam okay first kenapa aku hantar anak aku pergi preschool secondly ah bagaimana ah bagaimana ah
mm ah apabila menghantar mereka tu kan ah did it help
did it help in what dorang punya perkembangan ah dalam pelajaran
ah development self development tu aku cakap lah pasal dorang punya motor skills dorang punya cognitive behaviour dorang punya social skill and then benda-benda yang yang preschool boleh ajar mungkin saya tak boleh ajar like saya ni bekerja jadi macam mana nak ajar dorang math ke
more sight words ke phonics ke it's very difficult for me to read I don't have the takde macam dia punya layout on how to teach them
tapi kalau hantar kat sekolah kan semua dah ada
err a program for them ah senang sikit
so dorang tanya like um
then dia cakap like macam how do you feel lah bila hantar like is there any improvement aku cakap ya ada banyak lah improvement terutama kali anak saya yang nombor tiga tu dia memang very err friendly
you know he's very active dia pandai pandai berbual public speaking pun dia tak takut
which is true tak takut seh ah dia macam like ah gasak ah sembarang ah you know
so but aku macam like feel very abeh dia tanya aku lah like err is it do you think that it's because of finances
then aku cakap terus terang ni memang berat because saya ni sekarang tak bekerja jadi ah finances okay lah berat juga untuk anak-anak tapi this is for anak-anak education there has to be a way mesti ada jalan lain kalau nak cakap pasal private tak boleh
we go to a government based ah government aided sekolah and then kalau kita low income mesti the sekolah has a system for the lower income family jadi dapat further subsidies that's number one but if you want talk about kalau tak nak berbual pasal finances there could another reason the other reason kenapa ah mak bapa tak hantar anak-anak pergi preschool kerana tak ada tempat ah tak ada tempat mm in the neighbourhood tak cukup preschool ya so so I cakap okay terus terang ah untuk hafif I masuk kan nak masuk kan dia infant care
I registered him for infant care bila I masih dalam perut this is where orang semua cakap eh kiasu nya dulu pun I pun macam gitu aku cakap gitu dulu pun aku macam gitu apasal eh orang apa pregnant masih dalam perut dah dah registered now after that I dah kena I tahu kenapa kerana tak ada tempat so people have to be like
think ahead cause a lot of families right now I told her lah a lot of families right now dorang prefer hantar anak from what I know I notice prefer hantar anak pergi preschool pergi childcare daripada ada maid kat rumah because kalau kat childcare budak-budak belajar can develop you know at home ah
susah kan
take care only tapi ah
nak tolong ajar ke nak tolong exactly
don't try so hard lah cukup lah
terus aku macam like lepas tu aku fikir-fikir balik aku macam like eh kesiannya kalau kita punya malay community really do not want to
ah tak lah aku dengar apa ni
laki negro ni dia cakap
cam first dates semua tak mahu bawa apa ni macam makan semua just bawa jalan-jalan lepak tu macam wow betul lah pasal kalau
macam dia press for more nanti macam nampak lah what kind of person she is but ni semua orang dorang dorangnya alpha punya fikiran lah
aku keluar dengan kau ingat aku keluar dengan mimi kan tak pernah bayar apa-apa
tu ah cakap perempuan kalau gini dia boleh makan for free seven days straight boleh jumpa
but one thing aku agree dengan dia kan
macam baru kau kenal kan
she belongs to the street unless korang official about the status
macam kau tahu orang cakap macam kalau kau pergi date
kau fuck around pe gini macam suka hati dia ah
so like you have no right to like cakap dia slut ke apa kalau boleh meet sesiapa kau nak kasi dia banyak choice siapa dia nak as long there's no official status
dia berbual pasal ni kan
oh betul
ah ada yang kau pernah dengar this guy nama stephen top
tak stephen something ah some black guy dia tak believe in macam relationships yang macam boyfriend girlfriend
no matter what as long kau belum married kan you are considered just dating
I rather you still dating terus aku fikir balik
it somehow makes sense but maybe culture pun plays a part ah
asal ah
kau nampak ah
kau pun tak ada status pe
takde eh
yang laki selalu kau post eh
untuk aku ni semua macam pun ikut surroundings ah
cam not everytime kau kena guard
musim-musim you know you have to time yourself
kalau it's time to emotion let it out lah but if it's not the time then it's okay for you to be this way we understand
but at the time kau kau tak cakap then you still takde as long ah you know
cause of them takut cakap
laki takut nak keluarkan emotion kan but
some of them dorang okay keluar emotion but they don't know when
bila orang tak tahu macam mana nak express dorang punya emotions aku tak boleh pegang ah
ha ha ha asal asal dia cakap gitu
missus cheong sedih ah tak nak tengok
to think of it kan it's as seram at the same time
once dia dah realise ah
tapi untuk aku singapore is just that kita tak jumpa orang yang extreme ah like feminist
kau sendiri macam it's a wreck
dia is the true
epitome yang yang YouTube
video yang kau cakap most of this
just macam rosak ah like
that's why kau cakap they use this macam as their own is their moral compass ah
like tak tahu apa yang salah betul dorang pakai ni then they just follow from there
that time cousin aku kena
dia post about ada accident dekat sengkang kan
he happened to help orang yang apa this anak dengan bapa dia ah accident motor abeh dia cakap pasal err dorang accident motor pasal dorang apa ada a wild dog
terus end up this
perempuan datang like into the conversation and say that eh like cakap like
there's this humans is the problem for entering dorang punya wild life and dorang cakap if this is what if you're talking about like putting them putting them down
terus cousin aku macam flip ah cakap you don't put words inside my mouth
macam don't stir something up that it is not there
what the fuck sia attention rabak sia
I mean like dia nya cousin aku nya intention is just to show that okay this area is quite dangerous imagine kalau kau lalu kan just beware of the dogs ah the macam apa wild animals
ni semua orang just find it a like opening of for them to just preach
tak tahu ah malaysia ah
yang malaysian
yang belikan anak dia semua eh
anak dia yang gemuk tu kan
what if the this whole thing is turn table laki yang buat gitu then laki cakap kak sedar lah diri muka kau tu dah buruk gini gini then you know it's just turn out to be ugly
ya we are untuk aku kan at the end of the day we are just living in two separate rules
dia tak macam sense of emergency ah
cannot focus macam takleh
ah dia kacau ah
dorang just macam
camne nak cakap eh pasal the reason why tiga orang to operate that one man machine kan is cause that two person tak tahu apa
ah macam terus ni apesal
rabak sia tu
like kepala ah orang
umur berapa sia
kalau aku aku tak kesah sia like I think taufik pernah cakap ah the macam untuk aku the apa not it's too accessible apa knowledge eh
dorang pakai sembarang jer
oh macam dia annoyed
kau kau pause eh
tak kan
takpe ah aku bawa gi toilet jer boleh berbual-bual sikit
ah tak ah sangkut kat luar
a'ah cuci tangan
semalam shuk shuk bawa apa ah makan
wah best pe macam yang taiwan taiwan nya eh
wah aku dah macam
huh bastard asal
oh tak halal
huh kau makan
oh kau taruk tepi untuk simpan
sial ah kau
asal ah
dia apa fight as if like politically or
untuk aku is a marketing strategy ah
kalau dia macam berbual macam admit dia president siapa nak vote dia seh
macam dia have to say
tapi kau tahu yang dia popular face habis cakap grab them by the pussy kan
ah itu bukan dia cakap during press ke atau during ni kan it's during macam dia punya free time want to record dengar kan
pasal tak salah aku aku tengok video clip is like somewhere macam kau tahu yang camera macam sembunyi-sembunyi abeh dia ada wall abeh ada
macam mesti lah orang orang kat luar laki lain pun cakap macam gitu apa it's just that ni pasal dia korang macam nak use that against pasal ramai orang kalau kau tengok they use that phrase against dia apa this is how he treats women gini macam sial ah
pasal orangnya perception eh perspective sekarang is like
camne eh they rather have someone yang in the closet
macam sial rather than orang outspoken
dorang takleh accept orang outspoken macam orang he only talking his own opinion in what appears on his mind what tapi orang tak boleh accept
pasal kalau untuk aku orang tu clean kan terlalu baik aku aku always despise
macam there's there's always a way macam macam mana kita berbual pun kan ]even though
you want the best for each other kan but definitely kita macam gini boys talk atau mesti ada berbual kotor pe like gini gini but
orang yang macam terlalu clean kan aku always very despise macam
bukan aku jealous tau like how are you really sure kau macam gini punya bersih like
cam they feel their feelings express it that's all
lagi twenty seven minutes
all the lie tak ah
asal eh
tak tahu apa dia nak ah
so at the end of the day pun different orang tengok lain pe
so macam upon macam texts pun sama
macam kalau aku cakap sial lah kau
tapi kalau kau baca eh dia ni maki aku pe sial
tapi kalau aku aku cakap in a very playful way
kalau kau tengok macam kau punya thoughts macam gitu then kau fikir cara gitu then
how can can you blame me sia aku say in a very cannot blame me ah
non-stop sia tu
ah dorang ada record macam some dorangnya
talk ah sedih sia
pasal kau boleh dengar dari suara dia sia kau yang ah
aku tak tumbuk kau sia I mean like kau tumbuk aku
kau tak cakap abeh amber macam aku pukul kau jer pe
pots and pans kau campak vase
like tak salah ke tu salah seh kau tahu
macam aku ada listen to few tips orang kahwin ah orang dah kahwin cakap
then that's why it makes sense bila dia cakap
kan selalu cakap stephen kan
buat apa kau nak relationship lama-lama
in the end asal kau nak a meet up marriage before you get married you know you are creating another problem for yourself
kadang-kadang fikir balik macam sedih sia kalau yet to find out
macam apa ni the person that kau sukakan and then bila korang kahwin is just a different person
abeh korang stuck tau you are stuck there don't know like kalau aku tinggal
ni thing aku salah bila aku let it be it's gonna be a problem for me so how do I even solve this sia
like I really dia just stuck sia
that's why aku always believe this phrase macam doesn't mean we can vibe we are compatible
like tak semestinya kita boleh vibe macam eh but we are compatible for each other it doesn't mean that vibe and compatibility is two different thing
like aku boleh kita like boleh macam
ah people always said like wah if I can vibe with you okay okay but sial lah that is just a touch atau it's a two different things seh
whether you're not kau boleh tinggal serumah dengan dia and like accept who she is that's a different thing sia
so untuk aku macam orang selalu macam cakap aku boleh vibe dengan kau it's a
it's not macam it's not cause you can't true
dia nya expectations or
that's why aku takut aku tak understand about aku nya self especially
like sometimes aku suka orang ni then aku akan go for her
but kan bila dah at the stage macam boleh aku just cabut diri
untuk aku is like tak one thing is commitment ah macam the commitment of having someone to jaga is untuk aku really takut untuk aku
ya aku nya reason why aku aku understand this part of me eh aku cakap reason why aku takde mata air bukan aku cakap aku takleh dapat aku boleh but it's just that
dah a few times aku try and then aku just cabut
like aku just fuck up like I always find the reason to fuck this up ah like
just ghost her atau
ya so like sometimes aku just macam bingit ah macam takde then you know like I want something but bila dah ada nanti aku just cabut
so I always remind myself macam
kalau aku suka orang aku cakap kalau dia betul-betul then go for it ah if not then for what you waste your time
like in the end of the day kau akan cabut juga pe at the end of the day kalau kau tak suka dia
that's why that time kawan kau tanya aku aku terus teringat sia ni
kawan kau yang yang kerja nurse eh part-time
tak ah dia tanya takde mata air macam tak ah macam asal entah eh terus aku terus cam teringat ah ni like
aku kalau ada ada ah tapi it's just that at the end of the day aku cabut
aku ya
ya pasal
untuk aku pun itu is a different way of err camne nak cakap eh
it's a different way of macam kita own body ada own mechanics ah
the reason why macam aku dengan kau is always macam
diam dulu then nanti baru gerek is cause technically we are trying to protect ourselves
like dia ni boleh ngam ke tak tak leh ngam then why not why for what aku waste akunya time
kalau dia punya dia punya mindset is macam I got nothing to lose the world is mine
then like just live life to the fullest lah that kind of mindset ah but for us yes we have that mindset but it's just that macam
macam apa ni you don't need it unless we really need it come ya
romanticism atau all the stuff
ya lah I understand
one thing dorang been berbual pasal gender role ni semua kan dorang sendiri confused with their own gender role this kind of thing untuk aku lelaki shouldn't be the one doing it the most of the time it's it's a feminist trait lah I would say
so macam all these macam sweet stuff
all the macam masculine stuff the girl of course have to be kalau dua-dua side macam family then how how do we even counter this
there's no balance ah then after that's when nanti dorang dah complain oh dia ni annoying ah gini gini gini
like you eat too much sweets sakit tekak pe
kalau kau suka laki tu apa-apa dia buat pun sweet pe
dia tak buat apa-apa pun sweet abeh kalau laki tu macam he's not your type
asal pula aku kena panggil creep
ya lah
that's untuk aku there's no such thing ah
cause the scariest part kan macam macam mana kau dah kahwin dengan this someone kan
how sure are you that this twenty four hour otak dia is bedek bedek
bila kita tengah main kan aku boleh imagine someone else asal kau tak boleh imagine someone else confirm kau boleh imagine someone else pe but at the end of the day you have to give and take let her be and let her think let us think
that that's why the misconcept of macam
like oh takde connect then they cakap to make it in a very layman dengan very
to see that they are smart atau they can feel all these oh takde connection ah
ah lagi
thirty seconds nak tidur nak tidur
oh okay okay okay aku pernah dulu aku pernah buat apa ni mystery shopper that was many years back lah then after that uh the I only did once
because uh lepas tu like there's no job and nobody call me lah I did the ah aku pernah buat yang apa yang shopping tu eh
I did the one for uh one of the retailers in singapore lah but I have to go it's a it's a one brand tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak outlet tau lepas tu kan
one of the important one is the customer service ah because they are rating customer service punya survey
so you actually depends ah macam when you go for this job they will advise you first like what are the things err they are looking out for
and then err ya but for me is I just concentrate one brand tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak outlet lah
tapi uh after that they never call me oh for very long then after that just gone like that
but I got a friend who was doing something similar tapi dia punya product is
then uh she's given one product so it actually varies macam kau buat uh mystery shopping right
it's not just like shopping items sometimes it can even be like err basic necessity macam for your home
but uh my friend one is quite interesting dia pergi dia buat pasal uh food product ah I think they give her one product
can't remember what product I think macam like uh macam maggi then with a a particular brand specific brand
lepas tu nanti uh dia kena pergi uh two or three no three or four different err supermarket
so it depends ah macam mana kau punya what when you get the job you can actually find out what it's very interesting for a and it's very good pay
tak lah sia upfront
so it's your own free time bila kau nak pergi besok ke bila kau nak bila-bila once you are done before that the deadline that they give you
ya it's quite fast cuma uh they will give you a deadline lah by this date kau kena submit back come back to the office and submit ah
lama seh but I think that time was not hundred ah less than that
mm assignment tapi the assignment uh dia kasih macam uh tiga
the one the ya then the questions is all similar lah cuma three different outlet kau kena pergi then macam outlet A outlet B outlet C lepas tu the questions are the same ah
so customer service then the setting of the shop the display all that macam berselerak ke ataupun very neat always very neat
uh eh this date this or this week right got this date this time uh apa ni surveyor coming
so it's like uh consistency lah cuma the
tapi like the working hours how
cuma it's like quite far lah I mean uh I think I feel like it's quite far tapi three times a week okay what ah
ya lah but I heard that the pay is quite good you know uh apa ni I think it's fifteen dollars per hour
depends on the places that you are assigned to I think like macam dormitories eh the they can even pay up to macam I think twenty five dollars
that's why I was telling my friend uh and my friend was saying lah macam gini like uh she just have to work three four hours part time she already earn like almost hundred dollars you know
tapi uh do they give you like every okay you are you you are on a every monday and wednesday shift then your colleague is tuesday and thursday that kind no is it
ya lah rumah dia berapa bilik seh
mm it's so far it's still okay lah we don't have any pay cut tapi macam
macam uh like how long can we tahan like that right like are you sure there's no retrenchment like are you sure you are not going to retrench people or like we are very very skeptical lah
so like uh and then plus being in the fintech kan macam don't know whether is good or is not good because like the situation now it's like so so unpredictable
then uh like other products macam very slow moving so we don't know how long we can sustain
ya lah I mean rumours have been going around lah it's better to look for something else but again in this situation macam mana nak cari seh
abeh kalau macam right now like right now I'm still okay lah I still have a job what but then
so I was like eh when I look at linkedin I was like eh ada eh orang masih nak masih nak cari ni ah
dia jaga macam uh one of the creative uh asia pacific punya director eh APAC director
then the boss always travel overseas pergi overseas punya office kan
lepas tu uh her pay is like close to ten K you know eight or nine thousand you know
basically aku tengok macam
I was like oh my gosh macam some people are just so lucky
lepas tu macam new joiner new secretary join kan lepas tu dia tak nak uh macam she she will be the mentor lah because she senior what
and then uh selalu tak nak ajar lepas tu macam tolak balak jer lah like like just ask people to do ah ask people to do the powerpoint
uh ask people to change the apa send out the video but her pay is so damn good okay sekali it in the end bila dia punya boss tu dah tua ah
sekali just before I left uh boss dia kena macam apa macam apa tu
bukan retrench apa tu macam uh dah dah tua kan jadi uh kena
so uh they we speculated ah dia dia kata golden handshake so the boss leave right
kan aku dah macam eh kayanya dia ni lepas tu dia tak ada anak
for her europe trip lah this trip lah that trip lah I was like lepas tu the worst part is kerja lepak gila
but who the she was the one who supposed to do the powerpoint you know in the end she ask the other people yang macam very uh pandai buat powerpoint kan
ah then buat lepas tu dia dia just submit to the boss that's all her job like that I also can do and I can still earn eight nine K you know
gila kan
no lah but she was she was okay lah it's just that she's an okay friend but then it's just that working wise macam suka ask people to do buat ni buat tu eh
then she will be like uh sorry I have a a lunch appointment sorry I have this appointment that appointment lepas tu kalau tidak dia cakap okay dia tolong kan
sekali apparently that day she's on leave and she never tell you know macam bastard kan then then I will be like oh my god gosh like
eh when you ask me to ask you to to help you I help you seh then I was like okay lah then just telan jer lah because we are all junior level what she's the senior one what
macam merepek kan like so funny
and then she never tell him ke
yes yang dulu tu uh every time want to travel on only
kecoh seh but actually because I want to collect the points ah
so funny but they are allowed to travel on lah but then macam ah cannot the expensive uh like whatever flight eh kau tahu dari like expensive flights and all that right
ya lah macam yang boleh cancel boleh change semua kan
ya lah tu pasal kadang-kadang ah like what like especially the boss that likes to change every time will change lah or confirm will change his flight one right
aku nak book macam ah so scary then I will always wait until like really last minute eh kadang-kadang macam cannot so last minute what
ah macam ah the first name and last name terbalik apa and then got one or like I think two alphabet lah typo error
salah salah salah the name uh of the passenger becomes my name
the traveller's name to my name because I cannot use that uh apa macam
lagi pergi hong kong siak tu kalau pergi indonesia ke pergi mana mana like okay lah got potential to keep uh at most I pay back the company what
sekali tu that one is like like uh to hong kong and then is like completely different name ah so I called them up and asked to change right
and then uh apa ni they say cannot then I said
is I explained the whole situation lah I said I when I fill up I already fill up the correct name the correct passport the date of birth passport number semua
then cuma the last part the contact person the contact person when I fill up my uh I fill up my name
then uh there's one part that they they auto macam auto fill eh
sekali I go and pay everything then I realise and then after ah but they don't they didn't they didn't bother to listen to my explanation lah
tak baik seh
aku bilang aku punya tu lah yang senior tu makcik tu makcik makcik kaypoh tu
lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku uh it's okay lah everybody make mistake don't worry tapi dia baik cuma macam dia kaypoh eh
lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku just tell the uh pula tu aku kena bilang
dia cakap just tell the he's a very nice person uh I will back you up anyway you just started
cakap okay lah selamat ah first time kan so aku cakap abeh tapi aku offer lah if you want I can pay half of the flight ticket ah muka sedih ah
tapi tu baik gila sia dia cakap uh nevermind it's okay uh just make sure next time you don't repeat the same mistake ni semua ah blah blah blah that one I was less than three months old in the company you know like I see how much was the ticket
ya lah tapi macam irritating tak boleh kasih chance seh
irritating lepas tu kan lagi sekali uh is what ah
then after dah kecoh gila sekali got one guy and one guy right he's supposed to travel he is from vietnam to singapore he supposed to travel uh with
lepas tu the three of them reached the airport
sekali two of them went in<malay>dah masuk sekali tu yang the this the the last guy right was they she want to check in ah then the dengan bag dia semua tau
kesian dia dah lah check out daripada hotel lepas tu dia pergi kat airport abeh airport cakap ah sir your flight is tomorrow not tonight
lepas tu it's tomorrow night ah not tonight sekali dia kata no cannot be because we ah my my uh my colleague
sekali dia tengok balik dia pun tak check selenger bacin india
lepas tu dia dia tak check lepas tu dia dia check dia kata uh oh
it's tomorrow's date dia kata ya so see your flight is tomorrow's date tomorrow's timing but it's the same time as that day lah yang dia nak kena depart kan
sekali terus dia call aku kau dekat aiport dia cakap hi hidayah
did you know that you book my flight for uh apa
aku dah oh my god then aku tak bawa balik computer
I was like oh shit I was like mula-mula aku ketawa tau aku cakap huh aku macam ketawa ah
sekali dia kata no it's not funny when you are at the airport and two of your colleagues are going to board the plane and you are stuck here with no hotel room to go to
aku dah macam eh sia ah die die sia mana aku nak carikan dia ni hotel and he is very specific luckily bukan boss ah dia macam manager level there
aku dah selamat sia kalau boss aku mampus
then I was like ah oh okay terus aku macam okay okay let me check for you like the next available flight ah dia kata err
I don't want to fly macam certain timing apa dia sekarang aku nak kena book under the new flight apa dia mati-mati nak leave uh that night ataupun the next day morning eh
because he got meeting or whatsoever lah so he need to leave like there as soon as possible kecoh sia
ya then I was like ah okay okay let's divide and conquer you find hotel I go and find flight then he was like okay okay okay aku
tu lah masalahnya because they always keep on changing tau and then aku rasa uh yang yang lain tu aku dah book siang-siang tapi si lelaki ni
dia kasih dia bilang aku last minute dia nak flight ni nak flight tu the these are the flights he want this is ni ah
kira dia bilang aku last minute aku book kan dia separately last minute ah aku bukan book kan dia orang tiga-tiga at the same time
lepas tu aku tengok eh aku dah kecoh sia cari hotel
lepas tu aku cari flight ah lepas tu lepas tu dia call aku dia cakap did you manage to get the flight aku cakap uh not yet
abeh aku kasih dia options kan lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku ya I also can't get a hotel
uh it's too last minute and no hotels around here ah ya it's all fully book aku dah macam alamak
in the end we got lah lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia like uh aku tak boleh dapat flight yang kau betul-betul nak at this exact timing yang kau nak depart this is the only best option eh
habis tu dia cakap uh apa apa apa lepas tu dia kata ah okay then uh he he we sorted out the flights ah
hotel pula then uh last minute he say he just went back to the hotel that he just check out kesian kau I feel so bad I was like
apa dia dia kata uh I just took I'm going to take a taxi now to go back to the hotel and see they have one last room
abeh aku cakap ah okay okay okay uh you take the cab and then I know lah the journey about thirty minutes eh
lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia you go and take the cab now I will call the hotel
lepas tu pergi ah
lepas tu dah dah finish after the whole episode right dia dah balik hotel dia dah dapat tau the last room and I think it's the smallest room he's and he's very particular about hotel room also
so dia cari dah lah last minute tak ada hotel tapi nak cari hotel yang according to his category
aku dah macam ambil jer lah hotel apa yang ada it's just for one more night the next day afternoon that time he's flying off already what
lepas tu dia cakap uh yang dia patah balik hotel tu sekali kita berbual-berbual uh abeh aku cakap dengan hotel tu ah boleh ah macam any room can ah because
it's just for one night ah lagipun dia selalu regular kat hotel kau
lepas tu dia cakap ah okay and then in the end they found one small studio room for him ah lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia I'm so sorry I'm so sorry
dia kata no it's okay lepas tu uh sabo sia lepas tu dia dapat dia tak dapat flight yang pagi kan pasal the next day petang dia ada meeting tau
lepas tu pagi dia tak dapat flight yang dia nak kena balik kan aku dapatkan dia petang ke malam I think
lepas tu uh bila dia dia bilang dengan boss aku kira he's under my boss what dia bilang dengan boss aku uh
lepas tu aku cakap eh sabo sia dia ni tapi boss aku tak marah boss aku ketawa jer dia cakap are you just trying to skive and not come for the meeting
dia cakap no she book me the wrong flight aku dah macam oh crazy
kan lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia lah eh then you also should check you know aku tapi aku macam okay lah let's not be let's not fight over this aku cakap dengan dia we are both at fault I booked wrongly and you didn't check
mampus kan actually initially he was like that tapi aku cakap dengan dia there's really no other flights
uh budget flight pun tak ada unless you want to reel up and go via mana entah aku cakap dengan dia macam a very long route eh in the end you reach singapore also like the same
and lepas tu macam but after that he was like okay lah tapi he took that opportunity to shoot me back ah in front of my boss dia cakap ah ya she book me on the wrong date
flight back aku dah macam tapi yang ni pun sepatutnya aku kena declare dengan finance the ya the right
aku cakap eh uh eh this is what happen dia kata in case if uh anybody question then you can just look for me ah but if nobody question just let it go
buy new ticket ah lepas tu pun dah cock-up lagi then the the makcik kaypoh the senior told me like it's okay you just have to declare again aku cakap
declare lagi hari tu dah declare cakap sorry then declare lagi mampus
tu ah
lepas tu aku cakap ah takpe lepas tu but then the finance I think the finance explained to the lah
lepas tu dia cakap ah okay lah dah
uh aku rasa something more expensive tu pasal in the end he earn what right because he get to fly on the more expensive flight and don't have to go for meeting
uh entah
one way ticket totally different airline kiranya vietnam tu forfeit ah pasal dia tak nak travel on that timing yang kat vietnam yang aku dah book tu the next day punya kan
aku cakap pergi jer lah balik jer lah besoknya dah terang-terang dah ada vietnam flight tu
vietnam apa ho chi minh
tak tapi hari tu semua dah fully booked tak ada tak ada flight
budget airline yang kita check lepas tu ada like go uh transit via whatever very far away right
irritating kan with the transit punya tu
ya lah that's why I was like like lepas tu dia pula macam he's very particular hotel leh
then flight okay dia macam apa-apa macam economy apa-apa lah dia cuma but tapi hotel must be really
tu aku cakap mampus sia that day terus sekarang aku cakap uh we let's we both learned a lesson every time I send you you check okay
dia kata but uh it's not funny aku kata it's not funny when your
kan kelakar kan tapi lepas tu bila dia balik singapore I think the next he say hey let me uh hidayah let me buy you coffee we should go for a good coffee
dia cakap ya let's just go to the one across the road no need to get so expensive
lepas tu dia macam aku cakap dengan dia so next time moving forward aku book kau please check because aku cakap dengan dia at that point of time kau tahu tak date yang aku book tu bila
aku book on friday I think five plus in the evening eh nak dekat pukul enam tau
last minute everybody like confirm confirm confirm nak ni nak tu lepas tu kita aku duduk kat office tu dengan kawan aku kat depan ni
we went through like so many booking and then takut macam duplicate booking kan macam aku dah book the book kan
lepas tu some of the people right in the kira total about eleven twelve people all travelling at one time
but all like different departure date ah different timing different flight terus aku split dengan kawan aku ni aku cakap okay kau buat dia ni punya flight aku buat dia punya flight okay
lepas tu macam overlap lepas tu uh bilik pula kau buat ah okay kau buat this hotel room aku buat ni ni ni punya okay
lepas tu macam it's so messy I was like oh my gosh
takkan aku nak buat on weekend seh so I have to do it over what I was like
tak boleh pasal uh why ah
pasal itu hari pasal apa eh that we we divide like that because I think some is his people some is my people lepas tu
lepas tu uh those who is travelling on saturday there is some from my list that is also travelling on saturday so aku pass kat dia
lepas tu dia anyway ya lah
lepas tu ah it's it's like that lah so it becomes like I don't just take care of my team you know macam my team got ten people right she got two for example right
then I got like maybe three people that's also travelling on the same date as her one of the people that she's in her team so macam kita passing passing eh
lepas tu hotel pula lagi satu kan kita kena book direct we don't have travel agent what
ah aku punya team luckily that guy is like like like like very good I mean he's okay with me lah
he's irritatingly macam uh macam action he's from india
tapi actually he's he's a very straightforward person and he he mean no harm lah it's just business nothing personal eh
lepas tu yang si hotel lagi satu hal
kita book direct kita takde ni kan travel agent kita book direct kan lepas tu kita pergi lah booking dot com hotels dot com apa apa yang murah-murah tu kan
lepas tu hotel the the same hotel dah full
abeh uh apa ni aku cakap dengan kawan aku tu eh then how dia ni dah full

jalan from the train the the
train  semua what what's the train say the
ah  jalan through the streets know sightseeing always  sampai the
um yup then some ya pernah but okay lah they are they are okay ah
then from there ah yup ah  satu naik stroller ah  satu the the smallest one ah ah mm
ya ya ya ya banyak halal ya ya correct
 dari from  apa ni the loop  kita naik dia ada apa the the river tour eh
ah river tour the the sand sand river all that  semua ah ah
ah ya ya ah ah we are  kita punya is just the the sightseeing just the  duduk-duduk tengok-tengok
ah then then  situ kira macam rest lah
we still have the picture the exact same picture that uh it was that was on the news  yang dah  terbakar
architecture we ah  kita kita jalan ah all the way  jalan
apa from from gare du nord  jalan around the area
the english guys oh  paris is dirty but to me  dua-dua equally dirty the difference is paris has ah more sightseeing places
the the  dekat-dekat first ah
then there's there's this  apa shopping mall  baru lah  apa nama dia they
 dorang betul-betul cater  untuk singaporeans but because I went there
 besar-besar lah the poster uh you can use Nets here Nets is a singapore thing what right so
literally every shop in that mall I think is paradigm ah I I can't remember the name you  boleh pakai Nets so it's obviously catered for singaporeans what
mm  nak kena tukar
buat crochet jer kan tapi aku macam nak try
benda other than just macam bag pasal aku nak jual a few bags
tapi macam I want to try cardigan lah skirt
tapi aku takut because I need like macam time to try it out
macam model it out you know takut dia macam for sizes and all so
to macam
advise me on the sizing and then macam so what kind of design people is interested in
cause I don't have like banyak content cuma aku aku post apa yang aku ada dulu
tapi tu pun aku buat untuk aku punya self bukannya orang beli then macam
sekarang ni orang yang beli pun kawan-kawan aku jer I don't know how to macam reach out to
because you know Instagram ada yang promote punya function tapi kena bayar aku tak ada duit dah lah aku tak
uh hobby punya expenses kan so ya
but tak ada duit so what's the things yang kau nak try
aku start pasal aku ada duit kan so aku the first step I did was aku beli mesin
that step I felt very macam alamak abeh sekarang kena beli kain kena beli ruler
but I I still have not macam masuk class atau macam any course yang will teach me
professional way ya so I think itu pun aku nak kena belajar so kalau if you want to join me
I think we can always join yang macam you know the SkillsFuture kind of thing
yang I saw at Instagram the one that you I send you that time then you were like uh but you don't even know how to draft why would you join you know that there's a lot of level right
aku nak join the highest level the terus buat baju kurung that one you know
yang that time I was interested in that time when we want to go the open house
I think that one also have like course it's not like serious schooling but is like macam after school uh part time I think we can join that
I mean for now if you if you really want to learn you can borrow like you can you have your parents punya
ya aku pun rasa sama I think that's why I started my shop because I've been following so many macam kedai dorang semua sama like I don't know what I think I there's like a certain time
and if you all no no offence there's like a lot of people jumping on the bandwagon ah they hyping all these kedai too much no offence
I saw one kedai dorang jual tote bag like
like basic gila tote bag dia abeh ada macam embroidery macam
macam pathetic ah to me no offence it's not like high skill level embroidery but it's like sixty dollars and people all buy and it's like sold out I'm like oh my god like I can do so much better
and some more kita kan daripada artistic punya course
ya that's why that's why um apa ni
that's why because because dekat Instagram they always like
up it up within like people of our community we always kita selalu macam bilang you are artist you you gonna charge
punya harga mahal it's a piece of art it's a service people not tak semua orang boleh buat benda gitu pe
so just charge lebih jangan jangan cause some more kalau kau charge low nanti other artist kena macam compare macam then the customer macam kenapa orang ni murah kenapa kau mahal gila
ya that one satu lah itu betul
apa ni benda-benda simple gitu
okay lah like I I guess rezeki dorang lah you know but then the the machine is it embroidery machine atau machine just help you stitch atau
is it tulis letter punya atau
mm mm pasal my brother dia selalu buat commission work
so orang yang order dia punya commission work is like kawan dia banyak kawan dia atau cikgu dia
tapi dia pergi charge murah seh like A four
oil paint eh not oil acrylic punya paint they charge twenty dua puluh dua puluh dolar jer hello I'm
untuk dia senang lah memang untuk dia senang dia dia draw satu kali satu malam pun dah habis
so dia cakap tak akan aku nak charge mahal-mahal tapi dia cakap
benda ni bukan banyak orang boleh buat lagipun orang there's people out there yang charge benda mahal-mahal kenapa kau just macam
aku agaknya tak confident lah eh macam insecure macam aku nak jual tote bag aku berapa
macam mahal sangat kawan that kind of thinking you know
but ya so I think kita people like us kalau nak
buat benda-benda gini we should just do because we I don't think we have like necessary knowledge in macam style no offence
and we if we if we create a trend right people will follow that kind of thing macam no offence like
like Instagram shops now locals semua macam they all have the same style
scrunchie ada banyak kedai scrunchie
pasal scrunchie senang nak buat
just uh just kain straight abeh kau tahu getah abeh jadi scrunchie ya
boleh lah
tak professional
but I like how macam sekarang punya Instagram shop is like a baru punya like a new platform to jual and you don't have to take rent right itu satu
macam kedai physical kedai ah tapi dorang pun aku follow a few kedai yang buat baju
so kau kau beli dia jahit dia tak jahit dia tak stock up
so kau kau beli pastu dia jahit pastu you can
baju ya I think that's very important
satu kali ni aku nak tidur abeh aku teringat eh I can't believe people throw around that that that term free size
apa kejadah tu free size
how can anybody have the same baju badan like kalau macam aku dengan kau kita bukannya
size jauh sangat tapi kau kan tinggi sikit
M S S tu pun macam okay at least you got like a few even though is like usually just S M and L
ya what about all those people yang tu macam kecil sangat atau besar sangat dorang kena dorang kena macam
apa ni grief give up sacrifice their style just for their size like very sad
which is like lagi mahal lah
ah tu pasal
lagipun sekarang macam kita our world or our like I don't know maybe people around us or my generation kan
kita more to macam a sustainable lifestyle
so banyak orang choose to beli
local atau secondhand atau thrift tapi
if you think about it thrifting and secondhand atau hand me down dia macam kau kau selalu kasi aku baju kan kau tak nak pakai kau kasi aku baju pasal
itu boleh boleh senang untuk orang yang badan macam smaller than people so kalau banyak orang yang macam
besar sikit then macam mana dorang nak like
sustainable dorang nak macam oh macam long don't buy from fast fashion tapi actually fast fashion pun baju semua kecil lah tapi
ya that's why aku suka sangat dengan this new macam trend of kedai Instagram yang buat
custom fit is I think is very important I think kalau aku boleh jahit I think that's one of my goal macam
I like it's always at the back of my head to buka kedai baju lah actually tapi just I don't have the necessary
skill tapi kalau aku boleh aku nak seh aku suka gila kalau aku buat baju kurung dekat kedai like yes
like yes the baju really is your baju it hugs like is really like your shoulder size your your apa
your apa ni
and like lagipun baju yang tailor is always last longer
tahun pasal kan ada tag ada nombor tau and nombor dia belum nombor singapore yang
modern punya you know macam nine tu ya number dia lima or something like that how old is that ya
pasal pasal um
thrifting the word just the word just thrifting kan thrift is macam cheap murah
so kalau kau sustainable is when you buy something that already exists tapi macam at the same time
ah so you don't have to buat benda baru so it's not wasteful lah kirakan tapi kalau vintage vintage is more of like a collection
is mahal hundred dollars for a T-shirt for people apa seh T-shirt one hundred dollar tapi macam is
it got it got apa ni is valuable is got context ah there there's a history to it
uh uh abeh yang thrifting ni secondhand murah macam kat lucky plaza pasal is
people tak nak I feel like value a a a object is based on the
people nak ke tak nak is demand versus supply lah that's what makes the price
so ya I think kalau orang confuse I think why why is it so confusing
you just see the price kalau two dollar that's not vintage macam
oh ya lagipun
benda yang kita kena tanya ni actually kenapa baju sekarang murah
what makes it so like orang orang tanya kenapa kenapa mahal tapi dorang tak pernah tanya kenapa murah
cause there's actually a cause behind that murah you know
until very sad that's why aku macam sekarang aku dah hundred percent
uh prevent myself daripada beli baju dari Uniqlo Cotton On
ya actually aku tak beli baju baru lah actually pasal
actually no offence tapi kau kasi aku banyak baju and baju kau semua lawa semua my size like I want to give people like I want to macam kasi kasi tapi alamak lawa pula pakai lah
abeh satu kali satu kali ni aku keluar family aku dorang semua pakai baju kau sia
you give me I I wish orang lain pun ada this kind of macam relationship with friends atau macam macam
nyai aku selalu kasi aku baju pasal dia orang kampung kan dia orang kampung boleh gather baju abeh dia tak suka atau dia besar kecil
dia kasi aku so aku selalu ada these people around me yang akan kasi baju but then I I don't think other people
so got a lot of people cause I some sometimes I ada orang tanya aku pasal this sustainable lifestyle like they want to try also then they say
how how to get baju yang macam
bukan fast fashion and how do you even know
ya people always shit on fast fashion tapi actually fashion industry as a whole is very
bad tapi susah lah kan tapi ya I also don't have macam
much to say other than macam kalau aku ada baju aku kasi kau tu jer
ye pasal kan actually kalau kau fikir fikir balik kan all this um wasteful punya life
cepat sangat is like so fast like it's sudden
macam actually kita yang boleh nampak lah the drastic changes actually dulu-dulu
did you know that plastic bag was created by the swedish lelaki dia nak create plastic bag pastu dia nak
dia nak he wants it to be a more sustainable uh alternative tau
dia tak nak pakai tree dia tak nak pakai paper bag pasal is from trees
abeh dia tak nak pakai macam cloth bag because it's uh to produce cotton you need a lot of water
so plastic bag is macam oh macam senang kau boleh lipat taruk dalam poket boleh pakai lagi tapi orang
kita salah guna lah kita ada convenience kita buang after every use which is
crazy to me disposable how can satu benda kau buat susah-susah
terus kau buang plastic bag macam factory kena
lagi kalau kau belajar chemistry you know how all this thing is created daripada element dorang semua
kalau if you really look from the root kan kau macam oh my god I can't believe I throw that after one use you know
so going back to yang cakap pasal kedai Instagram and orang sekarang banyak buat benda
the uh it's a like bagus yang orang sekarang uh try their best untuk belajar all these skills balik buat apa ni
just buat benda-benda simple lah tapi at least dorang ada apa
ada berusaha untuk buat benda-benda gini once you buat you akan
hargai you know how to appreciate like how how it's being made and then
once you because we are so jauh daripada the the process we don't see it the process of doing all this that's why people kita tak
tak macam eh a'ah eh macam mana macam sayur sayur orang tanam susah-susah pagi-pagi bangun abeh kita tak makan kita tepikan buang
it's actually not our fault lah it's just how time has changed abeh macam tapi alhamdulilah kita dapat this
ilham this know in our head that we get to apa ni
belajar lah just educate yourself all this knowledge is important actually
we we can lagipun kita bukannya sustainably more aware jer I think we just more aware of everything
satu satu pending belum bayar
agaknya lah
is it lagi mahal dorang akan
macam kat mana-mana advertisement tu or what
explore page nanti ada keluar kan
explore page ada macam yang fashion
shopping all that tu kan
pasal actually ada satu dua orang tanya macam berapa gitu tapi dorang overseas then
actually I can I can ship overseas tapi dorang macam oh okay thank you pasal I I think they prefer to buy local lah obviously leceh kan
cause actually crochet kat singapore ada a few kedai crochet kat singapore you know the farah lola that one
ya that one but then it's like to me I don't really like singapore punya crochet punya
design design wise they more like for public friendly eh macam colour dorang macam
black grey tapi crochet it's still crochet but it's just like not as like my style lah
ya it's not like quirky ya pasal kat banyak seh kedai
macam banyak gila and it's all so cute and I like most of it I like inspired from from dorang ah
aku tengok dorang that's why aku nak macam I think that's a good thing about social media kau tengok alamak what am I doing so kau pun
lagipun kedai tu dia actually she used to work at kedai kain pastu pandemic kedai tu tutup
so dia selalu bawa balik kain yang dorang tak nak tau just scrap it's it's kirakan scrap tapi banyak lah
so dia bawa balik abeh dia collect over time abeh waktu pandemic ni dia jahit
dia jahit bag just simple bag it's all shoulder bag
lagipun dia dia baru graduate daripada university of textile or something like that ah
so I like her rezeki like so good lah pasal dia start baru waktu tu yang quarantine tu
abeh banyak orang beli habis tu sekarang all of her kain is dead stock
you know dead stock kain like no more like it's just orang tak nak macam she's already
her lining all recycled uh ah not recycled apa ni
cute she make it cute lah then the kain not that cute tapi she make it cute
abeh sekarang dia ada lagi satu size kau nampak
size dia panjang sikit sling dia abeh it's like big
ya alamak I think one day aku beli ah
tapi susah nak order tu dia drop terus kau kena order
pasal dia punya collection dia tak akan buat balik pe dia satu kali jer
aku pun nak buat gitu tapi kalau buat gitu then aku kena constantly come up with new things
kau tahu tak tapi kalau orang nak yang itu aku macam ah okay lah aku buatkan kau pasal I obviously I want money right
aku cuma buat aku tak tahu apa plan for my
aku pun nak buat gitu but then
aku punya followers tak banyak sekarang so
tu lah actually kau tahu farah lola kan dia punya design satu jer
cuma colour lain
so like everytime dia nak buat kan they just buat that thing and it's like how to say ah
design dia satu jer so kalau imagine
and she will drop that thing she will drop and say okay hari ni aku jual hari ni korang boleh pre-order
order that ah senang kalau kau punya design satu jer
so you can keep doing that same design so you can stock up lah kirakan aku nak made to order actually if can that's why it's a bit
so like that's why ya aku hundred percent will like
I don't know how long it can last tapi macam kalau ada kain it will be more durable
it will be more durable tapi kalau cardigan kan there's not much weight to it kau taruk kat badan kau pe tapi kalau bag kau letak botol
taruk botol tapi it will stretch ah eventually no matter how tight I make it you know
ya then macam quite fun lah because aku follow a few crochet punya kedai and they all so supportive they always share story of the design they like
then got this one kedai she daripada philippine then she say oh uh
uh reply this if you are kedai then I will promote what um the my my best the the my favourite post of you abeh since aku buat tu dia dia
post kat dia punya story abeh like a few crochet philippine punya account also quite cute ya
just happy to see orang singapore
creative so kita
ya even tengok orang pakai baju pun sedih I mean like bukan baju lawa tapi then macam err selipar pakai seluar pendek
tak boleh aku pet peeve ah
knit ke knit
kawan aku buat accounting punya course
sorry maths aku
kau interested dengan benda ni
actually aku nampak banyak job posting dekat job street about

like you don't have you don't really have to study like ya an alternative lah lagi kau hands on ah ya
arts arts kalau tak ada pandemic pun orang tak nak tapi the need for it lah
dorang ada tuesdays with morrie
abeh ah while the rest ada I don't know ah this city city got show I don't know what is it
I was supposed to uh kerja untuk hotel tau
you know hotels has the such a big show it's like the biggest show like selalu cakap kalau kau boleh kerja hotel kau boleh kerja apa-apa
production pasal is like four hours long like that then like the dresser is A and B you know
so kau ada shift so like oh my god aku takut lah waktu dia cakap ah you want to go hotel then I'm like yes but then I just yes cause I need job right
nasib baik tak ada tak tau nasib baik ke tak
kalau ya seram tapi kalau ya pun wah macam what an opportunity right ya
ya like hotel banyak gila cast then like all the cast is like
orh the third aku baru tengok crazy rich asians
okay lah cerita dia mm not my type lah
awkwafina pun vietnam eh ke korean
entah lah but they just take all and all kind of asian they can take in hollywood lah
okay lah I guess they we're going somewhere the representation tapi macam nampak force sikit ah
and this thing waktu tu aku dengan kakak aku adik aku macam heated heated argument
do we really want representation kalau representation gini macam hijab
macam okay kalau korang step macam diverse tapi macam there's not much
depth into that diversity just macam show off yang oh
show kita ni diverse then macam
some more like apa ni
if like if you kalau kau include orang pakai tudung like just example
kau tak payah taruk plot there something like culture what you don't have to keep like throwing to the audience like oh she's the muslim she's a she's a muslim like can you just like
talk about her like any other character macam okay macam do more about her personal punya character development whatever orh tak payah macam
cina jer cina jer ni martial arts
macam can you really you can just make a show cerita apa yang bagus
cerita ni a good place quite good ah good place
like they never even they never really macam
cause ada ni kan jamil is it is that what you call her
jameela apa nama dia the yang manny
ah nama dia jason jason ah yes
cerita tu tak payah macam force it's not force what but if if you really look at the cast macam quite diverse what
but that one tak macam oh
oh you know tak payah
cerita apa eh
it's bodoh
I saw someone I I saw a interview you know anthony padilla from smosh last time dia interview siapa perempuan tu yes
so dia ada buat porn pakai tudung abeh oh my god it's like so
macam how to say it's like very popular so it says a lot you know
oh my god sia I mean like it it's not kesian ah actually aku dengar interview dia sedih
dia buat sikit jer sia
dia cakap dia buat macam six video or whatever ah like macam ya
okay lah tu lain cerita ah
it's just perempuan dengan lelaki just different
no kalau kalau if you ever come across lelaki yang like like bothered by this
let's say he he he want to macam argue no lelaki pun but no don't even argue because
kalau kau bukan orang tu kalau kau bukan part of that
uh group you shouldn't be sort of defensive what kita bukan punya
kita bukan cakap yang kau kau pervert kau semua pervert bila masa cakap gitu
kita just cakap what's fact it's been decades since
macam tak payah cakap isn't it obvious macam adik aku sometimes gitu pasal adik aku dia
dia annoyed with modern feminism dia cakap
macam you know all this perempuan yang bogel kat street dekat lah all this but then you you shouldn't you shouldn't look at the at the
surface you shouldn't look at the surface tu apa dorang buat jer tapi you should really look at the cause the issue you know ni macam jauh sikit tapi aku nak compare pasal aku suka tupac kan
suddenly tapi banyak orang macam oh black people they are gangster cakap pun macam
pekik-pekik maki-maki each other tapi dia cakap dia there's there's one thing he say very like really got to me he say if you cannot
like the problem is dorang like how they even become like that you know
you know macam how perempuan become so aggressively err berbogel ni ah why they make it until that point you know
ya sedih apa abeh lagi malay drama's not helping
ya allah I don't know how at this day of age people can still produce that kind of show
kahwin contract
malay punya drama kahwin jer itu dorang punya conclusion eh kau tak nak kahwin nanti kau tak boleh kahwin itu jer
oh my god kahwin sia apa-apa problem kau ada kau kahwin
and kalau tak ada anak tu tak apa and like ni semua lain orang punya masalah lain tapi you should really look at the rezeki that you have
instead of we don't have I mean like memang manusia biasa kita selalu macam apa yang kita tak ada we really look
instead of buat cerita suruh orang kahwin kenapa tak buat cerita suruh dorang hargai apa yang dorang ada what the shit eh sorry
abeh nyai aku tengok ketawa-ketawa abeh nyai aku I don't know if she like it or she just like amused by how bad it is
pasal aku suka tengok cerita korea korea is like more in depth like they have a lot of issues

alamak uh lynn sekarang tengah kerja kat catering kitchen ah buat kerja part time tapi kalau you nak kerja uh I boleh ajak you kerja lah awak nak tak
alamak kesian
kena the hijab then later got stains all those germs mah so maybe they might be concerned with that but then I think they can always uh how to say they can prepare like a modified version of the hijab such that it not only helps to protect the muslim nurses but it also allows them to do their job right I think that is one way that they can do and I know that recently they have been talking about that
but you make a promise what to meet her at two like I mean if you are going to be late you can always inform her lah like I'm going to be late so you can macam meet later or you can meet schedule another date ke apa then this one he make her wait
oh no wonder lah you keep messaging me want to go matchmaking cause you want to avoid that situation then I was like thinking why this girl always nak cari boyfriend lah cari husband then I'm like want to go matchmaking together I a bit segan lah
I know what you can do you can go to the mosque and find any imam and then say abang tolong saya
oh my god I feel I feel so weird right now you have so many interesting experiences with people who like you I don't have much but I think I have one story lah it was during my project so um my diploma we collaborated with like engineering students so we have to do like auditing at uh low income households kat yishun ah not really at yishun it's like canberra yishun area so um we were having a briefing and then I was like
and then he said uh can we exchange numbers cause you know for the uh final year project I was like okay lah I mean he's not like the main committee but I was like okay lah why not maybe at least can update him and stuff then after that from then right he keep messaging me on telegram on whatsapp and then during that period right uh what is that movie ah marvel is it not star wars apa movie tu yang viral
oh henry henry punya lagu
but do you still use that same email tak kan
actually I also like him actually he quite handsome remember that time you know you know but it doesn't mean that I like him okay remember that time in secondary school we were sitting like you were sitting in front of me then you sit beside justin then I was with rayson ingat tak
kau buat apa the whole day
then bila I dapat tahu yang dia akan cerai with dia punya uh isteri right
actually I don't know asal dorang break up ah eh asal dorang nak
cerai everything
at that point of time yang aku rasa macam wow he found the one
it was just berapa tahun yang lalu
and I rasa macam
kalau I Bella I pun maybe will do the same thing cause I'm stuck in that cycle
ya they got back together I think time bulan ramadan I think they got back together that which make me feel macam
don't ah jangan lah judge and everything then I was like oo okay
actually that time I terserempak dia then when I saw him right
like you know all those malay community or what right they were like bashing him and look down on him but when I look at him I feel kesian cause he looks very like
entah lah maybe it's the parents or maybe it's the the way his work is
cause that time I know ah dia kena tangkap pergi karaoke dengan like other girls
buat kot cause like
ya I mean no harm trying ah sebab if you tak try then you'll never know what
from ten to twelve I have like uh group consultation then from twelve onwards is um ten minute consultation with my professor then after that dah balik
no lah like I can balik but at the same time macam I got like macam this whole like deadline to do and like reflection due on wednesday
uh should be kat rumah lah cause sekolah like
ya no fast err there's only one halal malay stall which is ayam penyet
but it's okay lah cause like most of my classes dia online
so kalau online then I just
okay lah bila I first datang right
I feel a bit macam intimidated
asal you tak sabar I thought that
kalau you habis kerja then you don't know what what you gonna do with life
to have like a sense of security kat sana
ah cause I rasa lonely kat sekolah
macam cause most of kita nya classes online kan then dorang macam kita macam tak ada that common like bonding for us to make friends and ni ni semua
the example eh macam kau ada assignment due on week seven
dorang dah habis week
macam kanchiong habis
dorang actually kat sekarang
ah nama dia start with letter L
and dia punya kawan uh I think nama dia start letter B
you know I I nak beli baju daripada Shein you know Shein
I tak ada baju seh pergi sekolah
although I pergi sekolah dua hari jer every week
in your like situation memang susah nak save tau actually
for like kerja kan is just for you untuk
maybe one hundred you simpan
you know I rasa macam this year has been the slowest yet fastest year ever
ya I I rasa macam I've been a snorlax for so long
then sekarang macam
dah bangun kena kerja keras pula tu
you know I feel kan untuk present kita nak beli present untuk lelaki memang susah sebab
lelakinya present selalu mahal-mahal ataupun selalu because lelaki dorang macam very practical
cause eh I haven't finish cakap lah
okay then takpe kot
can buy him sabun
ya I mean if you want it easy then just baju eh then just uh perfume lah
uh I think it's okay it's just sometimes dia very busy
but at the same time I rasa dia boleh lah
takde lah I mean
that time he met Dakshah also sebab I tak free
huh I very like packed with a lot of things eh I got I struggling with school takde time ah
but it's really difficult to ajar him seh cause
parents dorang tak tahu tau yang actually macam mana nak handle budak-budak and everything
and then they just like feel yang cikgu yang akan
betul kan budak-budak punya pelajaran and stuff but
is very taxing penat seh
I ah boleh
ya I mean people always cakap alah jer pe
to secondary and secondary is like macam
I'm kind of thankful yang kita pergi a secondary school
yang not that macam
wah like you can really see macam mana orang turn out to be seh
and all the mats and minahs and
the fact that they start smoking even during macam lower sec and doing a lot of other things
actually I scared seh sebab you know uh recently I nampak kat news kan macam
budak kecil right eh not budak kecil ah like just like lower secondary everything
dorang um they even like kiss or make out in the school staircase eh like it's damn
oh primary school pun
social media ah macam TikTok
and I just tak faham ah cause like I remember that time
err ada cikgu ni dia datang kat
me and then macam cakap lah like ah jangan buat malu keluarga ah jaga maruah keluarga
and then dia macam cakap ah macam kenapa awak nak kena buat benda macam gini ni semua then I just feel that err they don't really understand
cause secondary school kan kita tak pernah lambat seh kita cuma lambat on the last day of school
Afif tak pernah lambat ah
dia pun lagi satu toxic nya orang dalam hidup
cause of her macam
ya I cannot seh dia seriously something wrong with her
I mean if you realize like those macam
there were like macam camne nak cakap eh
mm you know I rasa kan the best coach yang I ada right was actually my Singapore poly nya coach they were really like
and although I macam tak datang training atau I not that good kan dorang still never stop believing in me seh
and then dorang always cakap macam oh Ayra you can do this blah blah blah like that
I mean you mean if you're skinny if you don't exercise kan actually tak healthy gila seh
flowers kenapa you ingat birthday I ke
I suka um
actually I suka mixed ah you know I'm over the years I get so bored of like roses and baby breath
now right I keep looking at macam
I mean like they have all these like carnation or whatever nanti dorang letak dalam satu bouquet right it's so colourful it's so pretty like sometime you have sunflower yang macam yellow colour everything then you have like macam
blue colour of flowers and I and then macam ada purple sikit and then I rasa macam oh my god it's so pretty
then they always wrap it in a macam
you know macam brown packaging gitu
oh actually kan I takut seh nak simpan flowers so I I hope like people don't get me flowers for my birthday
ya that time bila I simpan flowers kan banyak cicak masuk bilik I seh
cicak lipas then flies
but you know ah I don't know if you pernah dengar there's this cafe called Antea Social
and then they sell like cakes ah oh my god bila I nampak I macam whoa macam sedap jer
macam nak pergi seh but confirm mahal
if I cannot like macam give birth or what right
I should be open to having anak angkat ah cause like
but at the same time I feel I don't know why but I feel macam tak comfortable
ya I tak comfortable I think in a way because like
someone punya
kenapa would you consider
but would you nak would you simpan like cat or whatever pet
ya you know last time I thought that maybe I can ah pelihara like
kucing when I dah besar but when I think about it right
I don't know seh it really depends ah whether I have time to jaga them or not
oh my god actually right last time I pergi rumah kawan I cause dia ada rabbit
and then like macam
dorang bising tau
I okay with zoo seh cause I feel yang macam
uh ya it's true ah yang dorang patut be to be at the in the wild and everything but I also feel that

I makan chocolate lah makan apa lah
eh you know kalau you tengok like advertisement everything right they always have like
uh toothpaste right like banyak gila right actually by right it's too much seh actually it's just supposed to be like macam one thin layer on your toothbrush and that is enough
then macam
tak lah tu group member lain lah you tak dengar betul eh

and it doesn't help cause like my way of commuting is uh to naik bus what then bus selalu ada macam they take the longer route what so that's why ah
um means ada ke tak ah
wow mahal pe
which really makes me feel like macam oh my god to work really hard
kenapa seh
some of it is very very small leh then I tak suka seh
I don't like to feel macam claustrophobic seh
a'ah seh I nampak then I was like why
ya I nak seh but like hello helicopter for what
ya I'm awake kenapa
I know kita kena buat sampai enam puluh seh
okay bagus
no I ada cakap dengan you I just
no that time I bilang you dah enam puluh
why is it ah he like macam affected cause you you cakap kenapa tak berbual melayu dengan dia
oh why that day you rabak is it or what
mesti dia macam I remember dah penat
I mean I rasa
buat orang penat and like ya
I think it's good lah yang you all just
I think out of all the people you know right like how much I love to use SIRI every like every err err everything that we want to search on google I'm always hey SIRI and dorang tak faham like dorang selalu macam give me some weird err weird like response
I macam malas nak taip okay so SIRI suppose to be the convenient option right it's suppose to be more convenient it's suppose to bring more convenience to your life tapi it's like double job ah I I I don't mind it honestly I don't mind it tapi you you yang selalu macam
for their day to day like everything is SIRI seh because I think they have like like google home or like alexa right those I think those ones are a bit more receptive a bit more macam how do I say like err they can do more commands maybe but for SIRI macam everything tak boleh
kita just tak kaya lah kita tak kaya
ya so if my phone can actually macam faham what I'm saying from time to time it would be nice lah I would I would appreciate it a lot lah
ah okay okay let's think of a scenario okay maybe raya raya kita pergi rumah dorang
okay salam hey selamat hari raya selamat hari raya
oh I makcik I I yang makcik eh wah okay
okay okay you makcik you makcik
you pakcik okay okay you pakcik you pakcik okay
okay okay kita buka eh hello selamat hari raya
baik dari rumah pak ngah punya
tak okay okay jer okay oh sejuk sangat
oh okay lah so pakcik tu akan cakap err hey SIRI make it hotter
kan yes it like that always happens like what's the point lah honestly I tak tahu lah what
I hope dorang macam it's it doesn't become like one of those err you know the movie her
like okay okay so the this guy eh okay I kind of forgot what he does or whatever but the essence of the story is that he err macam fell in love with the so macam because the became dia punya kawan like the only companion that he had or not maybe not only companion but the one that he feels paling faham like paling understanding
something like that like so dia macam
very err macam
existential crisis kind of thing macam oh no what's going to happen to me whatever whatever so ya that's kind of cool
it is kind of cool lah actually macam
it in this recording he said that tak tak dengar
I cuma dengar
no okay let's not let's be good citizens but anyway macam ah I think it's a good thing what he did only because like he made use make good use of the time you know of a bad situation he made it into a good one and
um like you macam lupa life before COVID mana concert err err indoor stadium ada
err you know what's weird like err I've been to concerts dekat big box and I feel ya
err err don't know but I think it's like the third or fourth level something like that and then dia macam um it's like a big
no but maybe maybe different concerts different but I think I've been to two concerts there and both the concerts is err like standing and I think it's weird because macam
kind of like JEM you know westgate like all the the malls there tapi macam to have a concert like the the the artist from wherever they are flying from they will be travelling
to jurong so they will feel like you know like I I guess you get the real or like you get a sense of like err a bit more macam authentic singapore but
like weird lah to have a concert there cause it's like sebelah dia is like furniture shop you know the furniture shop tempat makan I guess macam what
it's like you ya you have to buat research dulu ah like you cannot straightaway
is it in the the food court or is it like macam like tempat makan on its own
oh oh like I I probably have been to that food court and the food court that okay the the stall that I love so much dekat sana is
the naan oh my god the indian food dia punya naan is I think two dollar fifty and sedap gila and like the dia punya ah butter chicken macam tak tak ah lokek super sedap
I know macam dengar you punya mulut macam berair liur macam you know
not for more than just satu occasion ya
oh okay pasal like it's every macam not say it's everywhere it's like it's not just one specific place where all kurtas are it's like everything is everywhere ya I get it
and mahal gila like kita pula dia
oh murahnya you shouldn't gotten that one
okay kedai apa because I pernah makan dekat tekka punya market and there's a certain stall yang sedap also like it's not bad
is it dekat entrance you know there's the bus stop
I menang seh
ya so I macam very competitive
and like macam you know like like it's time I win something or more among your friends
or actually not had to win that game is like whatever opportunity I I boleh I akan menang lah but it was it was fun I love I love hanging out with your friends
mm like honestly same to me macam I'm not really surrounded with people yang
really play a lot of board games at home or my own friends they don't really do that but I feel like ever since I met your friends dorang like are really
I don't know maybe if it's in their nature yang dorang not the most err not say friendly not the most social macam
ya but not a lot like I it only I think only this year then I learn how to play monopoly betul-betul ya err before that I tak tahu sangat macam mana nak main monopoly deal also I tak tahu main
this is the thing okay the only thing I played eh a board games macam betul-betulnya board games macam meaning you are the board macam not card games or whatever first okay kita just board games was the game of life
I I think masih ada kat rumah but I have to find it
okay everyone will start at a point where okay kau nak belajar ke kau nak
ah start kerja straight it's literally like this it's literally life decisions ah that will make you ponder about what to do next tapi dia macam fast forward gila ah sebab after maybe a few turns you dah graduate lah err then for those yang macam dah start kerja after a few turns towards the ending you dah ada anak you know you dah get married you dah ada anak so it's like it's very fast tapi it's quite fun err so that's the game of life
no I've never played that also when I was young so snake and ladders was only because your friends you know macam introduced me to board games and shit oops sorry err introduced me to board games eh I wanted to ah bring that board games to
officially like official game rules I don't know how to play like to me macam snake naik atas ke turun I don't know ah ladders boleh turun ke naik atas you know like I don't know which one is which err I don't know proper dice rules also macam err you know like if you um)(ppo get the same ya exactly or snake and ladders I think cuma ada satu dice satu die so so you get six you can go another turn that kind of thing ya like I don't know I don't know so it was that was the first time also I played with my friends um but before that so there was the game of life when I was younger
dia macam aeroplane eh ya I I ingat and I think I rasa I rasa I pernah main juga but I tak pernah
like research how to main betul-betul ya
like kita lend or macam like kita will put into groups and play I don't know but pick up sticks was one of my favourites also like I love to play that game
it's the one yang you cannot move the thing right
whatever it is okay lah some people will think strategically dorang nak amek the one with the highest points some people are like just take as much as you can and accumulate all the points
so but whatever it is okay it will start with how to explain it eh all the sticks in one hand okay and only one person does this dah one hand and then dorang just lepaskan that's it
I think is I think as many I don't know lah but like only one person have to do that and then dia lepaskan kan so it's like everywhere right scattered ya so like each person just have to take one by one lah
ya which is okay tapi sometimes even the one at the top can tergoyangkan yang the other one
okay I tahu about that ball I don't know what you do with that ball like macam is it supposed to be a throwing game or what but yes I do remember that paper ball yes
for a moment I macam
in my whole life I tak pernah cakap tu dekat siapa-siapa so kenapa I cakap tu dekat you I tak tahu main chapteh no err I I think I'm pretty bad at chapteh err for people who can play what's that called yang the sepak takraw I salute like cause it's kind of similar right you pakai kaki like flick the thing up like I think sepak takraw is harder than football or soccer ya so I ya I really really salute people who can play sepak takraw
I I I think it's better if you play it and also this recording is going to be vet by other people I tak tahu kalau the rules betul ke tak completely tapi basically like ah I I really want to play with you like this game so maybe I think we should get but okay congkak gives me this memory from primary school okay so primary school ya let's go way back in primary school
kita ada this one corner
macam kampung-kampung eh like but okay
err with the steps as well like it was like err I don't know how to explain ah okay paint wall right to look like the house right and there's like a platform with the steps to make it look like you tengah naik atas the ya to the to the macam what's that call like a patio luar the kampung like outside part of the house
okay ya the serambi and then like you know okay so over there they will like not say cabinets ah like shelves of games you can play so congkak was one of them
like something similar right okay lah dah tak special
so oh that one also macam macam eraser
err I never played but there was a point where like I would have a few of the country punya flags ah
oh ya it's always like the hardest to find eh singapore err but I never had singapore punya flag
oh wow apa tu it's like a what subscription box of erasers you don't know what you're going to get but each month you get or each week you pay
um and hopefully it will happen lah but till then macam it's not my biggest priority as of this moment because I feel like you know I want to be at a macam okay there are different goals that I want to achieve in life and right now that's not like what I want to achieve at this point
mm cause I think err macam uh in any company in any business there's going to be a loss you know but I feel like if I lose now it's too much of a loss ya so I want to be a bit more comfortable first and then
no like err macam I understand this is a goal that I want in the future
but if I want to push that goal forward I cannot do it now like I don't think I can ya ya maybe macam the planning lah planning maybe boleh
but macam kalau I nak buat sekarang execute everything sekarang I don't think I can yet
or your you know like you whatever it is you can still sell or whatever or you can still find the next big thing the next idea like but it's on you lah someone can have the same product but they cannot sell as good as you for example you know so I'm not too worried I do I do understand that macam kita dah discuss the idea we really love it we we think that you know this could be something
um tutorials to her starting vlogs to then her macam err buka her own ah no no not buka ah she collab with major makeup companies
so that's like the starting right like the first step is like collabs right and then after doing the collabs and she actually collaborated dengan this satu sunglasses company
ah like she gave birth to both her babies but ocean ya it's very nice but err that's not my macam
a household name like okay like macam everyone knew fenty as like her name fenty rihanna robyn
such a global phenomenon macam and it's because kan like she had the okay business is business you get money money is whatever you know like that's the goal of any business to make money to make profits right tapi the way she did it eh because she started with the makeup and the makeup brand the way she did it was
inclusivity was diversity was macam err
macam maybe you know there are certain shades that doesn't match her or certain um products that are not the most friendliest to macam that kind of skin tone
was probably like years in the making as well it's just that starting with that as the first business macam like it really
as the main thing that I'm doing in my life macam I dah tak payah kerja dekat office I
dah macam my family is taking care of
like all those kind of worries dah tak ada and all I can focus on is my business
but it's more of a personal thing it's not macam the company success you know maybe the company success is to get returns macam to get return customers maybe that's one way of like um success but for me is a personal thing when it comes to my own business is that ah
hundred K you nak tahu tak kenapa I tanya tu sebab kat instagram I wish I wish tak lah but okay actually
it's not a scam like I I I'm very particular when it comes to like the things that we see online right but so instagram there's this account and I'm still trying to understand actually so kalau you boleh faham you boleh try to explain to me ah so there's this account that is called curated business curated businesses okay that's the handle how I found out about this was kendall eh kylie jenner posted a post of her with luxury bags saying you can win this plus seventy K
and if it comes from kylie jenner it has to be like you know legit right so okay so the steps were that you have to follow curated business and scott disick scott disick is the the ah kourtney kardashian punya
okay so you have to follow and it was like seventy plus accounts seventy five I think so you you have to follow all of those and then just comment like like err the question was who are you going to share this seventy K with so all you had to do was um answer in the comments section who and just follow the businesses which I think it's a way to increase kan like real people you see it's not bought followers it's like real people punya accounts tapi the moment the giveaway is done orang akan unfollow ah
but it's just that like kalau orang tu terlupa then maybe the account is still there
okay so lepas ni semua orang so seventy K plus like all the bags tau plus tau it's like and it's open internationally so like I wanted to see how legit it is again they have winners from different parts of the world they have from japan they have from mexico they have from
so it's like it's cool lah macam you menang you menang you tak menang you tak menang ah so I ask you that because I macam if I really menang what am I going to do like
it's one of those things where you won't know until it actually happens you know or like you can think about it but will it happen this kind of thing so macam and some the person who won was from
I don't know I think it's the states ah florida or something it's not me ah they they said the results on friday I checked tak ada notification ya but ya like so um
I I think singapore quite mahal lah like
because the bags were different sizes macam there are some like the smaller ones there are like bigger like
okay seorang wanita yang suka
oh okay bag bag beg-beg apa what's like the
and then there was a point whenever I tweeted something macam my mum works at coach gitu ah then someone indirected me and said coach is the bossini giordano of luxury brands so that's when I macam okay I got to humble down but no but basically like um I haven't heard lah ya we're not representing it's just experiences personal
okay but anyway ya so I ni tak pernah masuk macam
sebab orang-orang dekat dalam macam sombong sikit</malay>[ah and very judgemental
err I don't know man I don't know dia punya price list seh like I think satu handbag eh
I tak tahu like
empat ribu probably gets you the small zip hmm probably the small one small bag
maybe I don't know I tak tahu I tak pernah so
just macam whether or not you'll be mm
I tak ingat sangat tapi
cause okay the only reason why I betuk-betul tahu there's a difference is that remember there's a comedy that we watched the the one the err the doctor from
no no cause macam the people who listening to this probably dorang biol like you know
ya ya ya ya exactly so the the the doctor punya salutation that's given it's not medical
I understand macam it's not something kita um
like something we want ah basically not something we want for ourselves it is understandable kalau like you tak tahu the only reason I tahu is because of that comedy and I work in a business school like that it kalau I don't I don't know mm
apa kita tahu is just main game
ya kita nak main monopoly after this actually
sorry kita curse banyak seh
tapi I trust you lah don't worry about that oh
okay err in order to be my friend you don't have to laugh at everything I say it's just that macam that is a plus point lah
err kentang the way I say it kentang goreng kentang kentang kentang okay like the question shouldn't be what do I like eating it should be what do you not like eating cause like I can eat anything else except for these foods so it's like
I don't like beef unfortunately sebab to me macam a bit
in terms of food but we'll why because kalau dah nak keluar makan
ya but I've I've never said guys I don't eat beef can we not go here like I've never said that because that's very rare that a tempat will only sell that and there's nothing for me ya
ya like steak house probably still has like ya ayam err ikan semua okay err so ya I think it's still pretty okay
just that andes andes sedap gila and
ya okay so I'm pretty sure everyone thinks it's called andes but kita actually dengar waiter cakap andes so
so macam usually if I go through anything that's not
so it like macam it reduces that err
that is not a good thing also jangan berhutang-hutang orang
tetapi err what I think you're asking is more like
will they be down for you like will they be there for you and macam really support you in times of need yes
macam mm there's pros and cons you know having a friend like that I feel like
cause it's easier then later bila nak pergi kedai ke apa kan itu semua kan senang sikit apa macam I had macam
sekarang macam senang takut mengandung sebelah sebelah orang senang daripada jauh jauh daripada orang semua
eh tak lah merepek tak tak tak tak no lah
eh nonsense nonsense ah no lah then if like my other wishes is macam I want to have like a lot of money so I can do my business all able to do the stuff and all ya
ah nak banyak duit banyak
no as in cause ten K some money I save up and then I go like I do my stuff I do my own business cause nak
I don't wish to be that much to have that much straight way begitu you know I don't expect much even if it's a wish I don't expect much
then if it's you if you have this three wishes apa
oh sikit setakat kalau gitu the tiga wish is
to like tak nak jadi tua
I mean a friendly vampire is not that bad eh boleh pe it's like always

my I was the seat was like so like together with the the tempat duduk uh tempat meja dia then the tempat meja tu then
dah pusing terjatuh then there was like five chairs peoples of full people like like there was like I think many people inside that place there was like I think thirty people already over there
they saw me falling but the best thing was that my hair was all face oh to my my hair was all to my face right so dia orang tak boleh nampak pun my face
oh cause bilik spare
pasal okay
recently dia buat dia
he did this one thing ah dia
okay and then afterwards yup ya tu the the other time different something that was something shadier ah
what he did was he like borrowed money from kawan aku cakap kawan aku lah ah this one guy
I mean I think you can guess lah who what what this entity is lah rather than who abeh
abeh lepastu then
kawan aku texted me
ah my our mutual friend dia cakap
eh apasal ada orang text aku
ni cakap owe money pay money rumah tenet nya
abeh like with pictures of his house and everything
in a bit I thought he was kidding ah cause aku saw the pictures eh ni legit sia
so I call him ah called my aku called tenet aku cakap dengan tenet eh
kau tahu apa-apa tak pasal ni please reply ah
abeh dia cakap oh tak tak ni semua tak tahu ni dah lama dah dah<malay>lama aku hutang abeh aku tak kasi nombor wafan which is our friend ah
aku tak kasi nombor wafan abeh I don't know how they got wafan number
abeh aku macam okay ah initially aku percaya dia ah then afterwards aku talk to my friend on the phone ah yang kena
eh afan kau ingat tak that time there's this one time ada orang tiba-tiba call kau cakap they are from
ah clarifying you abeh cakap ah do you know tenet
kata ya ya it's not my brother but that one my friend
macam okay ah
abeh lepastu ah ah then after we came to the conclusion that tu yang
that entity he borrowed the money from ah standard lah nak verify
you just anyhow give random person's number ke tak kan ya
so that afterwards aku macam oh
that's the thing we didn't know he didn't even know my friend ni that he didn't know that dia would be part of this ah macam
collateral damage I keep saying collateral damage pe semalam
abeh macam we were just
abeh terus when I call him about it aku cakap kau tell me honestly ah kau cakap kau tak kasi number then afterwards I ask him
yang that time this one
shady number called my friend tu betul tak
what you claim it was ke ini
abeh dia cakap ah actually betul lah gitu then asal kau tipu
kau tell us lah when you already in this shit
kau tell us properly ah abeh macam terus sorry sorry kata dah clear
aku dah macam dah haiya
oh tu aku tak aku tak sure ah but he can go there ah
so ya aku abeh lepastu then yesterday eh this morning ke yesterday he said
I'm going to move out and by the end of the month aku dah macam
cause any harm to me or my family yet apa so I don't think it's fair
so aku cakap it's okay for you still want to stay here tapi like end of the month ke apa ah
ya by october that was the initial agreement abeh lepastu dia cakap eh yang dia nak extend until first december aku okay
then afterwards she said dia nak tukar until
eh no ya five ke march I can't remember
ya aku okay ah cause he's been a good
so far tapi then
one thing on top of another lah that happen to him abeh then aku keep telling him don't do this don't do this you want to do them not here
abeh well
what macam very
and no you don't someone who doesn't think of consequences on top like very short-term nya thinking
you know you know those kind of people apa
snowball anjing
dia belum move lagi dia cakap dia nak
abeh aku cakap dengan dia takyah lah
end of next month dah okay
abeh like he thinks that
I don't know he thinks macam ye lah paiseh ah
if he knew about shade kau asal buat ni semua kan
ya he should have been tapi
that's the thing lah that's as good as me using your name abeh aku tak bilang kau macam eh ah nak pinjam duit
you know aku secretly put you as the macam kau applicant ah without without your consent
tu shitty thing to do kan
abeh kawan aku tu gi geylang dengan dia cakap macam
not really doesn't have a place macam I dare not kind of thing macam kau lah basically
aku didn't really bitch at him about it lah aku tak macam bising ke apa lah aku tak
like I wasn't really angry at him I I told I told him upfront aku I I said
I'm not angry at you aku more concerned rather than angry lah cause I was not in the receiving end of this ah so it's fine lah
cause that time pun the previous issue pun he didn't tell me then I found out aku pun pissed ah I told you already not to do that anymore
macam it's addictive what
yes of course it got stolen abeh lepastu he was really bummed out about it
am thinking lah what to do now abeh ada other ah ada issues as well
no he borrowed me money abeh lepastu aku trying to recoup back the amount that he took
bab tu lah he's going to pay back I hope lah eventually
it's he does it intentionally to avoid us ke
from what aku understand ah my wife said the same thing you get me
farid cakap he would just salam me and just cam balik
I mean okay lah it's true ah macam you I get there are some people feel that they shouldn't
ah aku aku do feel that every time aku hang out and the mistress is there back then mistress ah now they divorced kan
aku every time
aku do feel
what I shouldn't be there okay lah kim said it perfectly ah cakap
I don't want to validate this relationship tapi I don't want to say macam eh you cannot hang out with us ah
macam I want to hang out with him
but then eventually what I did was aku just told him nope I ain't gonna participate in this anymore I'll just leave the group chat as long as you are still married to her
lupa ah good names
twenty twelve I think ah aku don't really remember exactly
tapi eh eh anal lah then okay anyways stress ah aku aku dah malas berbual pasal ni aku dah malas think
cakap please boleh astagfirullahaladzim
tapi kalau just the
okay let's say it was just aku fahim and
lupa ah good names okay whatever lah bukannya ah okay anyway aku fahim and mistress lepak just the three of us the whole time
tapi this one whole group
tak usually we will know though
I mean initially my wife was worried lah dia cakap
what if you get tempted to you know macam add in to the dark side aku dah macam
to be fair kan aku only met his now ex wife lah very very few times I think
abeh kalau dia punya bad points aku rasa
she is too deep in this mentality where aku tak tahu it's just usually a I told you before we discuss about this before cakap macam
you know they don't have eh eh concrete plan to do whatever lah cause all their life they've been cushion by their dad financial ke emotionally or both usually both lah
ya ya okay it is controversial tapi
but aku I I don't know why I I see a lot of okay I'm not saying that I'm not discriminating ah this is based on I've observed maybe someone else has a better observation or throughout his life and as a statistic to
okay okay it is more so okay to be fair is more so of your family punya background dia macam financial background ah more than anything lah of course lah that plays a huge part
tapi okay ah to be fair
I'm not saying that it holds true for twenty percent or fifty percent of the female of course not lah I don't have the proper statistic but I'm just saying that okay okay you get my point okay back to her aku rasa dia punya other other point
she aku tak tahu eh fahim ah probably it is ah maybe in to say someone is crap but to say another person is macam he's been wanting her to lose weight but she did not
she keeps promising that she would she would she would but she did not macam many many many times
ya ya aku agree lah I mean he's not exactly the best looking male out there
aku macam how is obesity a discrimination towards particular race
tak tahu ah
no some apa no no surprise lah where you came from like which country you came from
aku rasa that's like one of the hardest nation to find obese people
aku believe kan the country could do much better if the royal family
invest in infrastructure in country lagi sikit cakap company
then you will see a better like it attracts more people to come abeh lepastu boosts a lot of opportunities blah blah blah the list goes on ah
but they don't so aku found out also that the poverty there is quite rampant know
other things ah macam wan ah
so aku macam find that to be very thought superficial is one thing lah the other one is
lama sia
kau okay you you talk to the guy before kan
aku tak tahu lah abeh oh anyway dia cerita cerita abeh then he emphasise one one point for that half an hour
aku dah macam please lah get on to your next point lah
ah aku tak tahu eh

takpe why does it sound like what
ya to me the way actually is very superficial lah eh he said this one line ah aku macam palm his face ah he said you know initially I thought
aku dah macam eh kau don't stop throwing that kind of corny bullshit at me lah sia
aku dah macam eh kau please please please don't give me a
macam there's nothing is spicing up their relationship
I told him don't meet her for like two months or something then you see lah for yourself whether it's really what you want to pursue ke tak if it's what you really want then go for it of course lah no one listens to my advice pe aku kan just an apa
which which she should have done from the start ah aku tak tahu kenapa she still engaged to follow him around
aku just find that very creepy
takde anything anymore together asal kau do this also I don't know
he can cause he has a daughter then he kept saying oh my wife is good my wife did everything for me she takes care of my daughter I don't really have to do much macam you know I mean it's fair if your wife wants you to do contribute as well or do as much as her lah
macam aku don't agree with the mentality ah ada orang cakap oh tak lah ni semua kerja perempuan macam eh
ah ni ni untuk kau
tak you know some people would step up ah dorang macam believe that they are better at it
yes I do only aku only one t-shirt aku don't iron

macam aku gain when I gain like what seven through sometimes I don't know how much I actually gain lah cause I don't really keep track
seven kilo I was so scared sia to the point where aku realise I must do something how can you gain like fifteen or twenty kilo it it looks like it lah I'm not too sure fifteen or twenty kilo and then there's thing macam
ya lah I I know lah but macam you can tell what there's a huge difference when you look at the photo macam from six days ago ke ten years ago
then macam
I really gain like twenty kilo sia macam you can tell lah pe the difference
I think for me aku at most gain about
ten around ten aku actually gain more initially then I aku started losing weight
aku controlling my food intake these days
aku don't really care what I eat more of
ya macam let's say aku the the trick is to have your breakfast as late
then the second meal let's say if you eat macam merepek minang ah aku just had minang again yesterday best decision ever
lepastu end up kau confirm lapar pe
ah minang then at night aku makan cereal
aku started at sixty six

ya I know I know I know macam ibu punya
eh tak basuh
tapi asal dia build differently is it sebab I I met the brothers in uni
tak the point is if you
tak mandi tak apa asalnya tak bau tau then you have to constantly check yourself what personal hygiene macam
gosok gigi ah please you know like last time like I kerja my supervisor
dia macam jenis yang macam oral hygiene like she don't care it's a she by the way she don't care dia macam ada tahi tahi
exactly exactly so macam kalau personally
it's okay tau macam normal lah you terselit spinach kan
ah leh macam tahi gigi on the surface macam from biofilm
and then when she drink coffee so she drink right and then the coffee stuck at the tahi gigi and then she will talk she will talk and talk and sometimes like was it serious
anyways it's like so macam mana she just talk to me
macam apa eh
itu because kaira focus gila because of her teeth oh my god macam habis kadang-kadang I think kawan kakak and then my friend my colleague also understand so she also want to laugh
asal dia gari emas eh
oh my god kakak tahu macam pakai yang macam itu rasa macam rimas gila eh like there's something on my finger
I don't know I think after a while you get used to especially kan the fake punya stuff
eh tapi cantik I think it's fine ah macam in life you have to experience all these
but it's fine kakak punya tan line masa tu dah lama I think dalam masa dua bulan tan line tu hilang and then like it starts again because that
I was having my menses second day so I morning tu bila ibu tiba-tiba message tau
eh ibu dekat luar rumah
tiba kan
then after that actually actually was abang lukman wanted to go to puncak to eat and then he actually told me kita cycle lah but then I say you gila ke because my bicycle is like macam
half can make it half cannot because that time ah we cycle all over and then my bicycle chain just terkeluar
then I panic ah then oh oh my god okay nasib baik abang lukman ada ah
then hari tu that day she suddenly ibu dekat luar pintu then like then after that thank god I baru habis mandi tau so I just open door
then it ibu dan ayah masuk ah and then ibu layan ayah to go for cycling then because ibu and ayah they are waiting then abang lukman just
then just say abang dengan ayah dekat luar kita pergi cycle lah tak baik macam cause we bunga ayah that time jauh pe naik
then he say oh my god K fine then we go so bila I pergi tu
um okay the thing is abang lukman belajar kan dia tidur pukul macam semalam pukul tiga empat pagi
no dia yang belajar and kakak tidur dia orang sembilan dah dah boleh bangkit and do his
I pukul sebelas pun macam macam kena langgar lori
pukul err sebelas setengah begitu
ya at first and then but then have to wait cause abang lukman berak lama
like thirty minutes later then abang lukman keluar then err we siap-siap and then we go but then I in in macam that chaos and that excitement I terlupa nak err makan breakfast
so I cycle all the way ah daripada sini terus sampai faiz and it was okay I was okay sampai dekat faiz the moment I stand up
uh darah keluar and then after I'm like oh my god terus macam kakak punya ini macam diri macam nak pengsan
then after that um habis tiba-tiba kakak punya vision macam half ah oh my god it was the worst and I thought cause macam overheated panas habis tak makan I a bit uzur
and then after that ah we balik ayah dengan ibu continue to marina bridge
lepas tu balik daripada tu um like kakak pengsan gila macam even bila dah habis makan right
when we were sitting there I am so exhausted like halfway through when dekat yang dekat faiz tu at the caldecott there's like a small
tak boleh cycle I can't like kakak macam terhuyung-hayang and I so panas so I took the air botol and then I pour my
ah macam just just basah and then and then because I cycle and then I wear serkup cause normally I cycle I no wear serkup but cause got ibu mah later ibu scold me
aiya so I wear serkup ah
it's the damn serkup
tapi tak lawa nanti macam pakcik err a'ah
habis macam bawah lawa cause I was wearing my what's that exam T shirt and the nice pant tiba-tiba atas macam kepala sotong
and then kalau masuk mall you have to open mah
your sun hat kirakan macam gila pe sebab I muka nampak apa cause like bulat
tau kalau you that macam muka macam ada mix sikit lawa ah maybe it's acceptable
but our our asian features are just you know ya we can't rock those like macam turban look
I think we have like face feature our face feature macam like for example macam we small like small face and then we have high cheekbone
have high yours and mine is the same what high cheekbones right it's only your hidung besar
so you should press it because last time you always listen to kakak aimah kakak aimah don't like
ah hidung mancung cause he say cause he say hidung tinggi nanti sombong like literally peribahasa hidung tinggi then I was like what the hell
ya so he she always penyek then you always macam hidung kata you just like okay ya ya like that
abang long shape his nose
it's like those like macam perfect macam mancung habis kat sini macam ada sikit habis macam lawa for an
ah for an asian guy so and then because I also ibu also always like you know ibu hidung mancung ah cause atuk is like indian or whatsoever
ah ya whatever so ibu got that hidung mancung mah
then ibu always say hidung hidung penyek cause follow ayah mah so serious I always like picit my hidung cause I want
um hidung mancung then after that I always thought my hidung was big
macam I don't know like macam because like orang keep on saying macam ibu keep on saying hidung besar hidung besar so
so ya lah you tahu when hidung bawang macam bawang bawang gila
bawang ah ya
macam nek onah eh bukan eh nenek
ah ya atuk jer macam handsome kan
I mean uncle zair tak tahu kalau handsome time muda
ah macam okay macam kak mira dengan amsyar
dekat nur and eh ah nur and
so then after that I tak nanti I think I met abang lukman abang lukman say I got small nose
like one of the small nose and like quite mancung for a malay lah then I was like oh I didn't know that
ya but it's still considered small tengok macam tak
apa mermaid man
but then it's like kecil then oh it's actually small and then when now when I look at the mirror
oh it's actually average looking nose it's not that bad you know like what you picture cause I last time I always thought I gemuk
exactly because ayah ayah keep on saying uh
uh gemuk gemuk jangan makan nanti gemuk faham tak so it's like macam daripada kecil you have that body yang gemuk but then padahal you tak cukup makan
ya it's not the normal beras apa
and then aku tak tahu sekarang tapi
tapi macam kakak rasa sekarang kadang-kadang macam I can do it
then bila I stayed at his parents I timbang I was forty nine
lepas tu it was just like
then I I don't know how if I have fluctuate cause kat sana makanan banyak sekarang di sini kita makanan independent so macam
on let's say makan macam sikit sikit kurang sikit
mm kat dekat rumah serangoon last time banyak gila makanan
maybe like don't have plan but maybe dia mak and ayah use car
tak happy eh tapi kan ada minimum
tapi yes mah eh bapa dia nampak demam sikit
masa tu habis masa dah tak ada so semua ni lepas tu tukar jadi babat
habis that day I I took photo and then I send to his ayah lah then I cakap makin tembam budak ni
a'ah habis apa ayam ayam ayam everything ayam kalau tak ada ayam daging
mesti pun hantu ayam because kalau kakak beli macam daging ke atau apa kalau kak masak kakak makan sikit so macam bazir so might as well I cook whatever he wants to eat which is
sahaja luckily your face don't turn into chicken
um habis but then you skin will be saggy
kentang chicken
ya aiya kau ni mahal mahal juga aiya tak tahu nenek cakap satu meal berapa tau beberapa keping ayam
adik tahu satu packet um ayam satu packet ayam berapa satu packet ayam dua paling murah is seven dollar forty five cent
dia lepas tu tanya dia berapa banyak berapa banyak pieces tu ah boleh dapat thirty six
ah separated kalau is thirty six wings chicken drumsticks dengan wing atau lapan belas set of drumstick that is how much tau
itu kalau one week adik makan six kan adik boleh tahan selama three
tapi still mahal you tahu semalam yang kan tangan dimakan tu kau tahu itu berapa
ah sebab bersih sangat mampus kan
I thing is ah I think ah ayah dan ibu even the chicken I mean ah sorry it's not that nice
macam what is the flavour
no she's good at cooking but she like masak but she don't like to taste her food
ah is abang home already
sebab because living room itu baru if you make dekat tu also so it's nicer for him whereas the bilik kan macam dah tunggang pecah if you understand
in the point of macam healing kan it's so much better to be in a clean and newer environment rather than macam old you understand
kena buat partition lah ayah kena panggil buat partition
buat lah partition
that house that house is so big it has so many potential tapi macam
ah recognise or macam ayah eh ayah ayah dah tak kuasa nak keluarkan duit untuk renovate and then ibu pula malas nak maintain so macam oh my god
macam they they put the effort to
cause ayah will start something and then he he will expect ibu to follow up with it
macam dah lapuk is so outdated already I think twenty years it was okay but now it's
why so degil one ah
ya can you imagine kalau rumah aku buat ambin dalam bilik tu nah
kadang-kadang nak buat ambin tapi nak buat yang macam japanese style
ah ya ya ya macam lawa macam just like platform it doesn't need to be a permanent just you can buy the platform is have that one then you just put your bed on top I think quite nice eh macam those
oh is it but you baring if you put your
tilam only if you put your tilam ah
the bawah is literally err
err apa ni like err literally like that tapi tak rasa
you don't feel it ah the only thing bad about that thing right they literally macam blew the papan onto the floor
so kalau macam in the future kalau nak macam shift shift but you can't shift it is like that
but I love a lot of things about japan especially macam dia orang
macam kecil macam dia orang punya design of barang macam macam kecil and it's so efficient in my opinion
so kakak cakap suka gila that time when we went to
kyoto ah then there's daiso a huge ass daiso and then beside it there was like a furniture kedai perabot
I think they literally jual macam one set macam sinki yang ni dan dia punya
cabinet atas dengan cabinet bawah dengan lampu dia dengan dia punya segala-gala lah dia punya there is literally one unit
and boleh masuk bathtub
can you imagine how amazing that is that's like this this this toilet ah macam bodoh sia
why can't they put the jamban and the sink side by side then we have a long ass
jamban just put together right oh my god
why they never think about it I don't know how they design it is so like so bodoh like even the tingkap this one ah
ni kan kalau rumah lama is dekat atas pe
this like for example kalau macam hujan but then you still want air ventilation you can open up the top windows mah then get air in
this one you open you can open the first one on top if you open the below air hujan masuk it's like so bodoh I don't know what are they thinking when designing the house
tapi ini macam bodoh macam bodoh gila
rumah juan yang dekat uh uh huh
macam lawa macam it looks like a bedroom macam ni it looks like a fucking bedroom right no fucking storeroom I don't know it's so weird
the jemuran eh
they don't even know what is inside the kotak right
ah ya but like I think if you wanna buy your furniture macam tu if ikea stuff don't buy on the kedai itself pergi carousell
jual and then jual dia harga macam murah gila babi yang itu macam apa seh dining table dua puluh aku beli dua ratus
so macam geram gila macam ini set alarm right um we bought this two hundred and forty
ah macam banyak
ya kau macam eh sakitnya hati ya allah ya
so macam tak perlu seh I mean like the thing macam almari ni seven hundred whereas we can actually bought it at
brand new lagi just have to fucking dismantle it and it is still very cheaper than buying a
itunya macam menyesal so kadang-kadang kan just buy from carousell
I mean yang paling biasa I carousell kadang-kadang dia ada kasih dengan free items eh
apa add on
tak free stuff macam orang kasih free orang nak macam just siapa-siapa nak ambil free ah macam give away
what tu apa
call of duty ini pasal apa eh

yes and then kau tahu aku punya kawan inshan kan
ya different dia tak ada then three years her course was just three years
so dia ada tempat dia sendiri dekat sana
india pun ada north india
tak nak malas because very expensive what
uh that one aku dah check semua boleh ada yang aku boleh ambil
and then bawah itu ada spain I think semua
so pergi or I or I pergi
ada orang kita tahu ke do we know anyone in the
ah apa nama tu
it's like a feature wall belakang katil
satu nak macam like that
then depan dia you want to put your projector or what then it's up to you lah
nak frame apa
might as well paint sendiri kan terus tampal amacam
I don't want to put something like you know macam frame
kena kat kepala tengah tidur sakit sial
confirm sakit
confirm sakit
I thought you want to tear down the wall and then taruk dining room
eh dining room pula dining table
entrance tu kan nak buat ah ni
nak buat banyak raised floor
it does so that macam if let's say orang datang
orang duduk kat atas raised floor tu kan macam lepak ke baring-baring ke
a'ah eh orang daripada luar boleh nampak eh
mmhmm nanti jadi
kaum puak eh
nak buat raised floor tak dekat sebelah tingkap
on anzari had ada ah
okay how about that room the first bedroom tu
kita buat yes kita buat raised floor
and then kita
buat bilik tu macam our workstation
ya it's like macam
it's it's a macam mana nak cakap eh
okay dia
raised floor dia sampai dekat tingkap tu so that kita boleh baca kat atas tu kita boleh duduk kat atas tu kita boleh lepak
where you can even baring lah senang cakap boleh boleh tidur lah kat situ
and then dia tak tinggi sangat dia tak rendah sangat
correct so if you can either duduk or you can even baring
but it's near the tingkap lah then bawah tu can put books or maybe kita boleh taruk maybe some
apa drawer or something like that
okay remember bilik tu ada ada almari
yang almari yang built-in
pecah kan
we we make a table macam yang
ah or either way lah mana mana nya side lah so that is where our
ah apa nama dia
laptop and our workstation ah senang cakap
then at the side maybe we just pasang satu
ah satu apa nama dia
satu swing yang mount dekat daripada ceiling
we don't mount dekat ceiling lah then we buy the the one that with stand
we get the swing yang you know yang facing each other punya
you know the one yang kita lepak dekat
nanti swing tu goyang sendiri
tutup lah pintu jangan masuk masa I tak ada
no lah I mean the swing yang satu tapi the stand okay pe
if we are going to workout kat rumah
okay then maybe okay then maybe satu
ah for us to run ke apa ke
if I want to go for weights then I go to the gym yang dekat tu
alah then tak ada swing
tak lah swing tu tak bergerak sendiri lah
atau swing taruk dekat living room ah living room lagi nampak
the yang
mount nak kena pay extra eh
mount cuba kalau because if we mount kita tak boleh alih-alih kan
why do I want to alih-alih kan
if let's say ya macam like macam kat rumah awak
kan macam mak
from this side then dia nak change to the other side
ah lepastu ni sekarang dia nak change to this side balik
ah macam dia boleh change tapi kalau dah mount
dah tak boleh tukar dah tak boleh ubah
ya you screw into the wall so if you take it down mana nak taruk tu
boleh memang betul but then
dekat wall the other side is not
wooden wall faham tak
dia boleh alih even with the console dia boleh alih
okay kalau kita ada console
we can move it to the window macam my house
ya okay pasal my house dia tak mount kan then on on top the console pe
ah so dia boleh alih-alih
so from there dia boleh kat situ dia boleh kat tingkap atau dia boleh dekat wall atau dia boleh dekat this wall
so you can you can actually macam if let's say this year you nak macam gini then next year you nak macam gini
ah tukar mood you know tukar tukar tempat ke
it it might you know we don't know which which one yang
kena dengan kita pe
no lights can just tampal belakang jer
so the light shine dekat tembok
so it it if kalau taruk dekat tingkap memang lah dia tak shine
dia boleh shine boleh boleh shine tapi tak nampak sangat ah
but if you put on the wall kalau ah facing the wall
then the the light will show apa
will memacarkan
dekat wall
of course lah tak lah
tu dah colour colour
no okay macam let's say sini
putih eh
then sini macam grey
and then sini putih sini grey
so that it will look macam apa tau how to say eh
because your okay because you said you don't want the colour to lari jauh pe it's medium grey and light grey
so okay if you even if you put it together macam gini dua dua and then in the middle you taruk
you campur dua dua
and then you go and paste ah macam
mm mm ya ya tapi satu tub one whole big tub tu tak cukup satu rumah
kalau one whole house is about two
yang besar yang as in tub besar gitu tau
ah yang the one yang sikit hari ayah bawa balik ah yes correct that one two
kalau for the whole house
it depends on the colour juga
so yang chalk nya is like macam
susah nak hilang ah
oh macam macam you know the pagar yang colour hijau tu
pakai chalk sudah normal one
dia jatuh takut belakang tali dia pasang tali tali putus jatuh kat kepala kita sakit kan
might as well just tampal
tampal tak okay tampal dia boleh cabut
so in a dia tak stay permanently
I thought living room you don't want to put ayat-ayat
eh kentalnya tak nak ah
frame is so old school seh tak nak ah don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want
but if you put frame dah macam rumah pakcik makcik
tu jer I can say it looks modern but if you put it in a frame it looks old school
faham tak then that is a different story
okay then kat bilik ah
see kat bilik pun tak nak
so nak kena ada pergi balik
okay is it ayat as in ayat from the al-quran or ayat is just macam words of wisdom
since awak tak nak nampak sangat eyesore sangat kan why not put it in the dining room
where got tembok
masuk rumah is just tembok kecil sikit jer
ah tembok kecil sikt lepastu dah pagar pagar pagar pe
tembok tu I think I want to macam panjang kan sikit ah
then the yang yang satu satu satu tu nak buang
but then kita tak ada if like that then kita tak ada store
I know so I thought if let's say kita dah masuk then we make that store we make it as a store
and then our dining room kita kecil kan sikit ah sebab meja besar gila ah meja dia boleh duduk berapa enam tujuh lapan sepuluh orang boleh duduk
I don't know whether we still need store room tak because barang-barang besar kotak-kotak apa ke nak simpan
kita beli vacuum like vacuum punya kotak you know that kind of thing
then kotak-kotak tu nak simpan
okay so we kita akan kecil kan that dining room
so that masuk boleh jalan kat dalam
atau sini taruk barang aje then sini boleh jalan
nanti dulu ah
nanti nanti dulu ah I mean I think by next year I think next year kita dah boleh buat ah
bomb shelter is semua rumah baru
kita nya bomb shelter is kat bawah blok
bomb shelter kat bawah
yang tempat budak-budak ah sekolah tu nursery ah that one is bomb shelter
ada uh I think kat bawah
mm tapi dia buat macam
I don't know lah but I don't think ada orang occupy that room
ah flat yang ada bomb shelter
ya because my flat ni ada bomb shelter untuk orang-orang yang macam macam daripada blok sebelah
blok sebelah ah nak lari
second room is macam taruk
maybe kita cantik kan sikit ke atau do some cleaning on it
so we just I think just guest room atau tempat orang nak solat ah dah
if let's say orang nak solat ah
even kalau dekat dalam study room tu orang nak solat pun boleh
kecil ah
but okay lah should be okay lah macam bilik amni
mm bilik amni is like that
ya kita nak taruk dia kat situ is katil yang
for now maybe my single bed ah single bed taruk sana dulu
because kalau
satu orang jer boleh tidur
tak kan satu nak tidur bawah satu tidur atas kan
takpe lah just
apa nama dia mm
katil queen-sized
just masukkan satu katil queen-sized
tapi nak kena swee swee kira menghadap
gitu lah so ada space a lot more space
so can solat down there
eh awak punya handphone macam jauh jer
tak tahu dengar ke tak lah but
because down there dorang dah buat
uh apa nama dia
dah buat almari kat situ
okay the the almari is L shaped
ah camne nak cakap eh it's like macam okay ni tiga room
letak sini dua then satu dua tiga
ah faham tak
rather than I have that might as well ada one two three
then one two three then in the middle put cermin
that place kita buat walk-in wardrobe
that short yang dia cakap yang the one that you say is short walkway tu kan
ah that one kita buat walk-in wardrobe ah instead of dia buat macam gitu L shaped
we tambah lagi satu gini tapi yang tu yang dalam tu the one inside
kita pecah kan
three macam gini
ah this like this wardrobe but three macam gini ah ni this is three
tak tak tak this dua pintu is three inside
then kat bawah sini ada
ah laci correct ah that one is one two three
then in the middle I want to put macam baju gantung untuk kat atas tu gantung panjang
from here to here sampai hujung
gantung tapi in the middle I want to put macam satu drawer
apa nama dia ah macam taruk jam jam ke
ah jam jam ke ah your accessories ke
can see through apa nama dia panggil tu
cermin eh not cermin
kat situ ah
because it's two faham tak it's two
so tempat siap is tengah tengah sini and then depan sini is ah
apa yang got space to walk of course lah got space to walk
got space to walk maksudnya
unless I want to take my baju lah
tak kan tak boleh tepi sikit tepi sikit
tak kan tak boleh
tepi sikit no
so kalau gini jalan senget
boleh pe
so the cermin okay the the ya is like this cermin
exactly beside that macam table macam gini tapi rendah sikit with a cermin
if you don't want cermin also can
then just satu table jer lah kat situ
satu table macam gini ah
like this kind ah like macam this this kind of laci ah
corner seat okay juga
then bawah ni semua is not our stuff
boleh juga up to you
can this one you want to take out pun boleh pecah kan taruk yang glass
but then not nice lah kan dalam kalau berselerak abeh orang macam mm
definitely berselerak
then the katil
my side dekat dengan tingkap
or you want to dekat dengan tingkap which one
then my side of the bed ada satu meja kecil jer bukan meja macam gini
dia meja kecil jer
bed side table pun boleh lah
mm then in sorang is a
ah apa taruk projector kan
kat mana nak taruk projector tu
tak ya your projector will project the image on the wall but where do you want to put the projector
you want to gantung dekat ceiling
or you want to gantung dekat atas katil
no lah I mean buat satu macam
not rak ah ya maybe rak
buat satu macam rak gitu then taruk kat situ
somewhere around here pun
waste of space might as well you just tampal tampal tampal everything on your
murah punya ah
if five room berapa how much harga dia
if four room berapa harga dia
tapi dia cakap five room
not my pasal what
correct what not my pasal what
tak tahu pula eh
if malaysia boleh
we also boleh mah
mm tak ada apa
check lah we check like macam bawah bowl ke bowl seat bowl tu ke apa ke
tak lah I think the sanitisation tak include cleaning ke
ah apa nama dia they will have a
jet no they don't need the jet spray you nak
dia nak scrub apa lantai
ye they have that they have that apa nama dia
I nak minum hot chocolate dulu
okay so kita memang dah tak
meat products as much as we did before I mean dua ribu dua belas eh dua ribu dua puluh dah kind of okay
so how how far lang nak go in to into veganism
I rasa
tapi in a way I think we're almost
I rasa
tapi I rasa I macam ada
selfishness sebab I don't
feel the same thing bila macam guna ikan bilis just because they are smaller than a chicken or lembu
ah I rasa selfish sebab they should be equal
ya ya ya faham mukbang
a'ah in a way lah sebab
I mean orang boleh guna alasan sebab anjing is our companion pet banyak orang guna sebagai ah ada anjing as pet
manja lah binatang tu can be so is that the same comparison
tapi kita start dengan err hunting and gathering food from ah natural resource macam
dia pergi memburu semua kan then baru come this era bila orang start berkebun and jumpa teknik berkebun
wah I tak ingat
jadi kalau you nak go into veganism you akan
be a vegan lah bukan vegetarian
telur I cannot leave that I mean I
I boleh untuk tak makan daging ayam atau pun daging lembu but I feel like I need my protein daripada telur
tapi the challenge
ah you I tak sure tapi I
the challenge will come bila balik rumah mama
masak apa yang dia masak lah I don't think I have the strength to tolak
because it's not something yang I boleh dapat every day
I I can do that kalau pergi kedai kawan
tapi kalau balik rumah family dia bukan sebab tak nak dia orang paksa kita makan
but I myself don't have the strength to tolak apa yang dah ada tu ah
ah and sebab I tahu
so susah ah
you macam mana
apa yang spark your idea untuk
err timeline ke
yang membuat you sampai ke part yang mana you nak jadi vegan ni ada cerita dia ke
macam cringe cringey
I rasa
yang betul-betul macam the moment yang spark but probably because of the pandemic as well
and because of a lot of things eh yang you bagi tau I lah and dia macam I was brainwashed by your brainwashing
it's easier to be a vegetarian or vegan kan sebab we have abundant soy sauce we have that err we have abundant soy derived products macam tempeh tauhu
mm sedap jer
ya lah sebab kita crave
spread penyakit ke macam nyamuk you you never know which one yang gigit you yang bawa aedes
extreme lah I mean I I think dua hari lepas kot I kena gigit nyamuk sampai hari ini tak hilang lagi
selain delving into veganism apa you punya azam dua puluh dua puluh satu
kalau ada lah
I think ada kot
I rasa I rasa I punya azam tahun ni I nak
sebab I dah lama sangat tinggalkan drawing and sekarang I rasa janggal nak buat the kind of drawing yang I pernah buat dulu
janggal gila sampai sampai macam halfway tu dah menyampah tau
tapi tapi I I tau lah kalau kalau practise every day
dia makin lama makin okay so that's one of my
lepas tu I nak
belajar italian
and probably greek as well sebab tu pun dah tinggal quite lama padahal dah pergi jauh dah hari tu
um apa lagi eh
I wish I can say yang I nak seriously
belajar music but
but quit susah lah sebab I I don't have the same passion untuk tahu what's behind the system
ah dia not not as fulfilling but
atau maybe about
nak cakap lack of audience pun tak juga ah
even dekat rumah pun
dia macam not as motivated lah untuk untuk pegang musical instruments
just in case tapi kalau dah beli then tak main
apa ah my other resolution
sebab ah before this kita depend on performance and
if we have side jobs yang
then tu macam bonus but by by the end of last year dia dah turn to the other way round
memang ah memang more than performances so I hope that two thousand twenty one it will continue that way lah because I tak selesa pun untuk keluar and perform and jumpa orang in this kind of the in the middle of pandemic still nak ada event takut juga ah
kalau you punya new year resolution apa yang dah boleh tiru dah I punya
berasa macam I nak belajar japanese sebab I tengok food wars tu tapi
better untuk focus dekat
tu lah
tapi so far italian is not that hard I rasa I boleh catch up balik
ah and I suka sebab macam once you belajar italian you can kind of faham french as well dia ada kaitan ah dia dia ada kaitan
quite beneficial untuk learn that one language
sebab dia boleh branch out to bahasa-bahasa lain selain language to apa lagi you punya ni you punya azam
uh I remember in harry potter the mirror of alice dumbledore cakap the happiest man will look into the mirror and see nothing but himself dia dah ada everything yang dia nak
I rasa it's not
and then ending pun
you you you you decide the topic pula
apa yang akan jadi in two thousand twenty one ah
I rasa akan ada
for sure sebab in two thousand twenty and none of creatives were deprived of
ah dia punya
macam musicians tak dapat buat shows
ah ya artist tak boleh buat exhibition
so in two thousand twenty one I think a lot of creatives will start macam
to make everything better for myself lah sebenarnya especially if that's their only creative outlet
dia redundant it's very redundant
but what about live shows I think um live shows pun dah start ada search juga because um sebanyak yang start to give out grants
for live events but but all these organisations memang
social distancing code scanning and everything so itu pun I rasa in two thousand twenty one there will be a lot of live events as well
I baca dekat twitter from the people who have taken the vaccine
dia orang cakap your arm will be soft for one or two days a lot of them don't even have
macam flu or fever side effect yang teruk-teruk
so I think I pun tak walaupun I takut jarum but I don't think I akan stray from I mean this is history in the making why why why don't you want to be part of history
ya lah faham
I mean even sekarang masa pandemic pun I dah tak ingat what happened in june in may
I think everyone wanted to be a better version of themselves just in case pandemic ni akan berlangsung lama and they cannot depend on skill yang dia orang dah ada so they have to broaden their horizon
okay can you explain pasal stoicism sebab I try baca tapi I macam
apa you punya philosophy philosophical standpoint
the good place because we watched the good places it or before that you memang dah
two two people can can learn the same thing but they might not understand the same thing that understanding tak sama so
once the border buka
scandinavian countries dia tak termasuk dalam apa nama european
bukan yang yang yang tak payah stamp passport tu ah dia tak termasuk dalam schengen countries eh oh termasuk oh then why
tapi I memang curious on how they can manage to provide
what about southeast asia or asia lah in general ada tak yang you nak pergi
ke kita memang western centric
I think sebab I think the the the reason is because
um dia orang preserve their history historical buildings are still there you can still visit macam dekat sini most of them are
tapi asia I
nak pergi tak I nak pergi indonesia but but but the parts yang kita tak pergi before ah
I think tu pun interesting and for some reason
I nak pergi thailand sangat sangat sebab I rasa macam I nak dia punya street food
tu jer kot as for now
ah india but maybe bila umur dah lima puluh nanti lah boulogne and lah
mm selain tu
eh tapi yang tesla buat
the space flight yang you can travel around the world in like less than three hours to
kan they dia buat dia buat this err flight flight system baru yang mana you can travel across the world in less than three hours ke two hours a'ah
so I don't know if that is still running sebab dia nak
benda tu affordable for everyone
I think that's a good thing as well hopefully within the next ten years ke
balik hari jer pun boleh
I suka that documentary
centric tapi understandable lah sebab creator dia pun from
wah I punya soalan banyak banyak yang macam what do you want
you dah cakap you stoic so I dah tak boleh tanya soalan-soalan tu
apa yang you nak change
mm I faham
tapi tu lah I think I learn more
ah dekat dekat internet for you I don't have internet at home
actually kat okay I mean form five pun I don't have
and I tak pakai
hujung form five I pakai iphone but before that I pakai
ada laptop but I don't have internet so what's the use ah but I
I lebih I I understand bila ayah yang ajar
kena ambil to TOEFL lah lagi sekali
tapi tu lah dia punya price point expensive
and I don't know what to do with the TOEFL certificate afterwards so dia expire after like two years and then I don't know what to do within that two years
until dia expire macam the last time I ambil rugi jer
then sia-sia even if you dapat offer travel while once you nak masuk dia akan minta balik your TOEFL punya sijil then you have to take again
two thousand twenty one ni
kira start of the decade kan
bukan yang two thousand twenty kan last year was the ending
a'ah kita tunggu the fireworks
kita tunggu the fireworks but nothing happen
I pun takde expectation
that that one quite fast tiba-tiba dah lima puluh dua minit dah
I harap
entah lah I don't have any
poll sekarang
like dia macam
tak dia from semua benda sebab
I tak rasa
macam you tadi cakap lah ah
afterlife punya benda kita tak tahu and it's not within our control kan dan ni pun sama it's not within my control so whatever happens happens lah
apa pun yang dia orang buat I think the best thing to do is to focus on what you can do
tu jer
entah lah
tapi I I'm quite positive about
tak hopeless sangat
it's been awhile since I rasa hopeless dengan
the whole tahun
oh kaum is a very sensitive issue
and I tak suka tengok Facebook comment
dia almost macam orang yang dia tuju atau orang yang baca tu you don't have any feelings at all
ah bangsa malas membaca
lepas tu tajuk everything click bait
ah I wish that kena change
yang tu kena change
but journalism yang spark head
orang yang malas membaca tu ya malas membaca orang yang suka membaca pun they have to click in order to know the
ni nurse yang nurse yang yang ni infected tu dekat yang vaksin mm mm
and then kismis dan
mm tapi yang news pasal nurse tu very misleading sebab even if you take your first vaccine untuk dia sampai ke fifty percent immunity tu dia ambil dua minggu
dia kena COVID within I think hari ke sembilan ke sepuluh macam tu it's not even two full weeks yet and even kalau dah two full weeks pun not a full total immunity
second shot baru ni tapi
and lagi pun journalisms sekarang mostly it's just screenshot of
most retweeted tweets then jadi satu bentuk berita ah yang penting ada content ya monetisation and yang penting duit jalan K
tapi content memang tak best langsung especially because the audience dalam Twitter and dalam Facebook is two totally different kind of audience
oh dah ni
lagi satu minit there's only one minute left
ah nanti kan bila you dah settle you click right ah tick ah
okay lah macam tak rasa sangat can speak one hour macam tak
wah so shiok to wake up on a monday to atas view of orchard and eat breakfast in bed in
it's it's in the middle of town but it's like the entrance is ulu but in town like like you cannot find the entrance like if you didn't tell me I wouldn't know where is it
no lah but at the rate like we are walking like ulu hotel entrance but literally in the middle of town is like
I think the only thing you cannot tahan is the toilet because of the frosted glass toilet
their customer their customer base quite like a lot what people go there and makan like I think because lucky plaza is cheap
ya the grandparents are both super cute but I think the grandma like err sit on the chair only but the thing is when you eat there right you cannot like chill chill you know like lim kopi like lunch hour people take their own time
ya ya like it's not like you're eating like super slowly but like sometimes you have the macam the luxury of eating at your own time own target but here maybe if you're not used to how their system is like the first time right the first few times we went we like oh ya cannot own time own target cannot choose your own seat cannot
no not ayam merah the there there is this minang store in lucky
ah indoor and I like because they have this sapi goreng or empal ya ya that one is nice it's not bad I brought risa there she ate like she order all the vegetables I'm like what the hell
because the husband kena heart attack what but that one heart attack in sleep so like she don't want like confirm plus chop she also kena lah
macam over the past twenty years
diabetic sana
she was eating a whole plate of tauge
tahu and all but but the bulk of it is tauge and I'm like she is eating one big plate of tauge I'm like okay healthy people
ya they're forced lah like die die die die must do what because like oh shit people know I've been gym-ing so so it's like if I don't show any result or something like quite lian</mandarin like quite embarrassing lah or like macam you know remember you made this comment about a schoolmate you said ugh she workout so much but don't really see much difference remember
wait so after we eat we're going to go to the Rolex centre cause we atas
at where oh so much for like not atas and then want to shop some more
I am eyeing that item online if I buy outside some more right habis
no if it's white I think I'll wear it only for really like macam events like like events ah
you should wear plain clothes then just wear bright coloured like err hijab so it's not so jialat it's like
jangan berangan lah please
okay you know what if if we don't get it then it's okay we can just err balik I mean like whatever I just if if we if have I will dabao and buy
rabak lah this one if if they tow away no if clams still can remove if they tow away it's gonna be another problem trying to like find the freaking bike cause it's like where is your bike why you why you ya so
chai chee like really bedok chai chee like really very err what's that called it's just really very ulu lah
so if you staycay in dekat town hall to see you
err no merepek lah but six hundred is expensive mahal
mana ada momok it's it's padang what
no it's gonna be operational in jan but leceh because it's malaysia so they're err authorities approval system is all bloody slow it's
like I think you really I don't know lah whether you need to like but then malaysia boleh so everything boleh you just need to have money
the younger ones ah macam the the the kids that are in tertiary education I think there's some of them they still lepak lepak and like
no ada what remember during the circuit breaker the the the
the expat yang is it the group of expat pergi robertson quay
the whole of singapore was watching what like kalau like kalau dorang didn't get send back home eh actually dorang tak kena hantar balik kan
exactly that's why this people expats all rich what boleh bayar
but then again right it's quite bodoh because you think about it ah kita tak boleh gathered in more than five people right but we have offices and
we will see actually I'm used to the mask already in fact I'm glad because if you have breakouts right the mask cover so nobody boleh nampak
yup my cheeks are like oh my god it's like rabak
but then cannot do anything but it's okay lah the mask will cover so uh tutup jer muka and the trick is pakai nice eye makeup so the mata nice like lawa the
I think you shouldn't spoil market when you talk to people right you shouldn't be too empathetic because um nanti orang perasan
no orang akan perasan and orang akan rasa macam eh dia ni caring eh this person boleh dengar aku
no you cannot do this because all these mamat belok ni semua macam um
dorang is it bebal dorang bebal so
and also kalau even kalau macam um oh is that a challenge ya they're going to purposely try like ons you were trying to challenge me right I'm going to see no you cannot do that all this mamat-mamat especially malaysia you must think like the typical melayu
actually I don't get it macam it's only in games mah like you can talk ah but macam why would they make it like you're obligated like why why you must why obligated to reply you at like you supposedly free time
what is favourite buaya
bodoh lah oh my god he
what bila dia nak tidur then he play game and sayang sayang people
tak dia bini bini nanti kalau bini bangun dengar is it bini dia tahu
bodoh lah it's just like cari pasal
husbands game so much ah biar pe tak kasi attention lah tu lah ni lah
interest lor or like um like like their own free time ah you cannot just macam oh aku nak main game tapi kau kena make time for aku macam all that shit lah I don't know
while playing game how is the kid going to be concentrating bapa dia tengah main game
why cannot main game kat rumah
there's bodoh it's just like
ah ya lah dekat kita punya void deck bawah block like the the kind that government makes
dia duduk tepi road untuk main game
macam dekat park or like the estate
just to main game until really late
but then dia main kat keluar dia pakai data
apa tu err is it some flu vaccine thingy the normal one ah
it's only sakit because it's not like
ah I don't want tak nak takut
asal okay now I scared tak nak is uh is wait
no I went to the toilet what then you were telling the story then emilio also said something then I didn't really hear apa
no tapi apa tu kan is like err isn't it like penetration unless they put their whole fist inside then then
exactly so why would you bleed if it's only tangan
I think maybe they should try to lube people when they do pap smear jadi dia lube
tak nak lah give up
nanti aku takut lah like what the fuck oh my god alah now I'm like oh my god oh my god oh my god I'm gonna be like so worried
pekik or not huh
ah okay my tolerance for pain is teruk so I'm like okay now I'm like err oh my god
then I think the the thing about orang-orang yang first time kita semua bela sotong you know right
tak ambil epidural ke
oh the contraction before dia sakit
nak so macam pergi pergi appointment first time semua macam apa tu
err pregnancy first err blur blur pergi appointment husband pun blur blur
pasal awkward
ya nasib kentang pergi clinic seorang orang husband tak nak ikut
I told you what we had this conversation yesterday kan I say kan some husband check-up macam tak nak lah geli lah takut lah nak tengok lah tu lah ni lah tapi semua nak bila nak ambil semua nak
got lubang any lubang also can
everything lubang just lubang
at least the mum ikut I think it like kalau kena
you eavesdrop dengar apa jer
as in budak tu nampak dah pregnant tu tengah oh
tapi the youngest yang aku nampak
she's turning twenty one next year habis anak dia turn seven and I'm guessing tak habis school lah right
unless err defer sekolah atau pergi sekolah until like you're thirty eight thirty
no you can differ what macam skip school for ya lah macam lepas beranak she can pergi sekolah then mak dia jaga lah
fourteen what the hell kau beranak fourteen empat belas tahun empat belas tahun you know it's like teenage pregnancy I usually think right kau beranak like oh my god kau beranak at like enam belas tahun or like maybe uh enam belas tahun onwards kau beranak is still considered teenage mum
kau beranak at empat belas it's like dude I haven't even get my menses I was I was waiting for my menses
err maybe their pull out game rabak lembap atau uh atau err because oral contraceptive kena bayar condom condom actually is the cheapest option already
you bodoh lah just bodoh
eh but then again there are people on or like even the tubal ligation then tiba-tiba mengandung
no sometimes it's quite uh quite err oh ya after the menstrual cycle entah lah tak tahu
and then ya is people all this whatever lah I will I will clap for you if you give birth at like fourteen that's like tak gagak sia
why would you why would you do that tapi kan she signed on to army so is like
empat belas tahun catch no ball with a son to look after
the sperm stay inside bodoh it's like
because when they do sex education we are asian dorang tak nak cakap oh korang tak boleh ada sex with like condom but kids are not stupid they're watching porn eh eight or nine years old
huh but all kids have phone now what you know even if they don't know how to search right you know sometimes like let's say you know like you watch show habis ada pop up
penat entah macam okay one of the reason eh sebab secondary school dengan primary school dah habis sekolah tau so macam ah dah nak masuk holiday mindset aku dah macam ah nak holiday nak holiday nak holiday abeh tapi poly masih ada lagi apa nak kena buat kerja ah lagipun during this period ah the exams are like
nak kena apa jaga safe distancing kan so like the exams are out so most of our
so macam and most of the time kan my graded assignment semua kena buat report and for report confirm nak kena buat research banyak
so I had to like research like yesterday I had to research like a banyak benda ah so
macam by the time dah habis sekolah macam ah dah dah aku dah penat aku dah penat and nak balik rumah one hour journey macam just the thought about it dah buat aku penat and when I came home
I submit lah but it was like ah macam
half half macam macam fifty percent punya reflection journal a'ah ya it was just a fifty fifty then I just submit
ya itu jer abeh like
like you saw ah macam I just macam mandi terus tidur terus lepak habis oi
eh but your poly days macam lagi rabak because
like creativity like err macam ah
no because three point one is more of macam internship tau and these tuesday ada briefing on the internship ah and then
like honestly I'm actually afraid of it macam I don't know because macam okay macam I don't know eh because of your experience I don't know even though like you're experienced kau macam put it in a beautiful way
tapi tapi just the thought of um having like supervisor I just okay the reason I'm really afraid of industry is I cannot do something that they passed me to do
okay I think I would like love to be in that situation because the internship is at home no I mean err ya it was at home so like but quite like mendak macam like err no err so like
because ya so they are she interacted with her supervisors or like the one that yang assigned dia through
I don't know lah dia tak elaborate ah but but yeah it was mostly a research
dia datang for like one two days first two days leh then the period starts
no ya for especially year ones because ya I had a friend in year one okay first kan orientation they cut off so like they couldn't like macam familiarise the building ya because during orientation right I like at least I can get the glimpse of how the things work over there how to go to this building how to go to that building tapi for my friend right the orientation is cut off so she never even like even like
macam gitu ah so like and kan dorang like most of my kawan yang year ones
dorang like
like suddenly they had to use microsoft teams and the ah school punya website
so macam
and for us like year two and year threes like we already like accustomed to like the the school website like how to download things how to submit things but year one they like clueless so like most of my friends here from year one they had a terrible semester one like first year ya and they couldn't like communicate okay like for someone that you meet online for the first time you would be like very awkward right kan so macam dorang macam
how am I supposed to berbual with this person gitu ah
no lah I berbual english because by the time right for my batch dah banyak ada yang ambil tamil gini semua
but then one thing I don't regret I mean I did not regret masuk poly ya but
but I didn't regret masuk poly because like because certain things macam how
okay so aku macam old schools sikit computer I'm not like
I'm not I don't know how to operate a computer ya ya I was I couldn't even I don't even know how to like eject thumb drive that is how kental I am
ya so diam so ah so bila masuk poly tiba-tiba dah kena buat ah share document and all that then I was like apa ni apa ni I don't know I don't know I don't know or like on the first day it was just like macam
like I don't know I don't know ah macam if I think that macam eh
during secondary school I know the like term google docs but I don't know like huh apa ni like what am I supposed to do there ah so macam
no wonder kau selalu pergi library I thought it was to like to baca buku no
since I'm already eighteen right so macam some some things that actually almost all of the things kan kau kat aku
just a small girl so I couldn't even help you I don't even understand like what kind of situation you are in even then so macam I tak boleh tak tolong apa-apa because I just look at the bright side like how you get all these things daripada mami dan abi macam dapat ni dapat tu macam semua benda everything first hand aku selalu dapat second or third hand aku macam I was kind of jealous at that point of time tapi that
macam dengar like what's like actually what happened actually so macam okay lah not deserved lah macam
not deserve lah macam okay lah deserve lah sikit deserve lah
macam messenger facebook
oh secondary three secondary four okay so macam
okay firstly kan since ah okay so the teachers pun macam tahu ah like how they stress on O-level O-level O-level but then right and my classmates semua macam ah heck care macam aku tak nak kesah pun pasal benda ni just it was that bad uh like even like teacher pun macam what
tapi for me right
why not have fun macam macam this is the last few days sebelum like macam like some macam ya macam ya
a good memory lah so like our class macam quite
rabak ah to be honest okay to be honest and okay since I'm the monitress
I couldn't like macam act serabak dorang lah like I couldn't be that rebel or something like that ya and even because and the monitor at that point of time
ah so macam
I had to do most of the things that macam
like attendance ah keep track of apa
dah hantar acknowledgement slip or whatsoever ah so and most of the time even the teachers know that ah
macam tanya monitor they will just go to me monitress so even the monitors the guy together I will be the one yang akan represent the class it was that bad so I had to be like the responsible one so sometimes no I had to be the most responsible ones
it was that bad so macam all of the things that I I had to do on my own because our class only had like around ten guys out of how many students ah twenty nine so nineteen girls and so the ten days and ten guys the responsible ones
tak ada satu pun ah terpaksa ah ah
and it was because of a vote class voting at the starting of the year so right for the whole secondary years I became the monitor slash monitress secondary one lah the four years lah it was chosen by the form teacher because the form teacher knew you so apparently so apparently like kakak was the major contribution why I became like the
monitress at that point of time err I don't know leh because ah tapi like they most of the teacher point out ah like I am so different from you and abang ya because both of you can go to like on stage and public speaking or can just go up on stage but for me right I avoid
going on stage or just just presentation in class ya I just I will just avoid it like no matter what macam ya no matter what ah
aku akan avoid at all cost to the point that at one point of time
B three I don't want to tell you tak payah ah so and during secondary three secondary four
well most of us dah macam go through many things so like and sec three sec four ada macam project macam masa tu ada this international is a apa humanitarian job ah so even before that going overseas right
we had to do that fund raising lah so like almost like everyday kita orang stay back and macam pop up macam this one booth kita orang jual air jual roti jual pizza and all
and until like the cost one dollar two dollar but then the thing is it accumulates lah so macam and had a lot of fun lah then bila secondary four okay by the time secondary four semua orang dah tahu that is going to be the last year and this is the last time untuk macam rebel ah bukan rebel ah as in show your true colours to everyone
somehow ah macam and since kita orang dah tahu is our last year kan semua orang makin rapat
and then so macam
even when macam ah the teachers like complain about us and then our class macam ah it's okay it's okay it's our class like that even like the teachers
macam this class macam hais this class like ah ah
but it's actually good memory like even like during stay backs or upper extra class during saturday ya this and there was this one time during one saturday our chemistry teacher showed us err pictures during secondary one secondary two no no it was a chemistry teacher malay guy err male guy male so he showed us during our sec one sec two during our orientation and we were like oh my god you were this lame or you were this short because I had this one guy during secondary one he was like err on my ear ear height by the end of secondary four I am at his ear punya height
eh tak actually I'm like his shoulder shoulder ah so macam everytime right I will like gaduh dengan dia kau dulu pendek then sekarang dia macam sekarang aku lagi tinggi so macam uh geram ah but this kind of memories like macam ah
but to be honest right I couldn't even remember most of my primary school days macam it's just like
A B C D E F ah so macam but some more pressure for being in the top class second top class ah
but then like for the lower class right dorang like stay back like almost everyday then is like one thing kesian juga macam like everyone akan tengok ya but then but the thing I hated the most because kita orang the first two class couldn't like they didn't apply us for camp
during primary six no because kita orang macam macam ah okay ah tak payah apex camp no I am more of a person of yang tak suka interact bukan antisocial
cuma I prefer less interaction
boyfriend girlfriend ah ni
kau hold grudge eh
so means dorang stay back longer than kau stay back ah
oh then why didn't you like cakap to your
but I but you guys didn't voice out that it was the primary six punya kerja
but did you realise everytime during camp or macam stay over kat sekolah kan
like most of us are macam tak tidur
oh korang tidur eh
oh no because for my batch right macam everytime kalau ada macam ada qiyam or macam macam sleep kat sekolah kan
selalu like malam kan kita orang tak tidur
kita orang kita orang uh tidur dekat level three the boys tidur dekat level one but then ah toa payoh
ah okay so ah so but then kita orang dekat level three kita orang tengah tidur-tidur tengah berbual berbual ah with the girls ah kita orang berbual ah macam gossip something like that
like dekat parade square running to the school gate then go to the parade square and stand kita orang macam curious ah like why is this guy doing this such a thing like during like it was one in the morning oh one lah
then kita orang semua gather abeh tengok like
I don't know I don't know what the guys did but it was a punishment suddenly there were like suddenly tiba-tiba ada empat orang pun apa lari to the gate and go to the parade square just stand there for like probably ten minutes it was a punishment but I don't know what they did ah but I think was something stupid or they did it just like ya I I think that they did it just like tak tidur so the rest kena punishment but then right I think the male teachers like macam
they walk around but for the female teachers right they just slept so like our girls sleep macam tak terganggu with any check
creepy keras
and it was all girls lah but dah tak ada lelaki so ah ah oh then suddenly like two of us macam nak beli makanan and because it was during lunchtime and dah penat ah so okay lah the so it was left with me and another one friend lah kat dalam
suddenly we heard the same thing you know the macam the drain ya
of the another car park yang sebelah Mendaki sense it was the other it was the other side so like there's no car
there should be no car beside us and is at the level one so macam eh
why would I know that's why kita orang dah macam curious then so like err okay actually me and my friend were like talking so macam we heard that sound then we were like
kita orang diam kita orang like give each other a look ah then like okay ah how about we just like macam macam
ah ah kita orang rasa macam how about we err we buy drinks from the vending machine then I was like so kita orang keluar a'ah
add up bila dekat luar baru kita orang macam did you hear that
but to be honest like the chalet or the like house right macam scary like the vibe
and it was like so far from the bus stop and the bus stop pun like quite sunyi
to be honest I've never encountered this type of situation and I don't want to encounter this type of situation ever because to be honest I'm quite a scary cat juga lah
no because because to be honest compared to the both of us kau lagi rabak so I had to be the one yang okay with it so macam ah I cannot
I think it was during the lunchtime lah so macam uh so some of us like went out to
mafia game eh no eh I don't know it was one of the games so we had macam macam ah
bukan application lah it was just a website kita orang ini so kita orang enter macam this group I'm in that kira macam game pin
then the masuk no no it was not telegram it was just a website ah so macam dah gitu so they will assign the mafia or the spy gitu so for that game we had to question each other lah like okay so ah what is this place this place have like
it was the Mendaki side punya Mendaki sense punya side and was the second level and the other corner bukan the corner to parade square the other corner nak masuk hall canteen
err how about we stop this this game because no one tau because we always like eh macam I point like someone else lah it was you then the other guy was no I thought it was you no I thought it was you so we were like who is this ah ah ya that's why we showed our phone lah macam no it's not us tak ada pun tak ada like kita orang tengok kat phone kan
eh all of us are like the macam workers staff at the place tak ada orang the spy
ah no the like no we macam they would like macam is there macam enough players kira macam this is like dah macam start the game so that only the players kira macam even we didn't like say the game pin out loud so macam none of us like
tak ada orang ah boleh suspect[oh no what happen oh because the day before kita orang tengok
during the stay back punya time ah mengundang
because I don't know because like it was like with the class kan so macam the scary movie macam the horror movie macam tak affect tak affect langsung ah
but then the next day it happens so kita orang macam ya
because they have to tap to masuk right
uh like apa with
kunci or was it a lock or oh pin okay
this dengan siapa
okay cakap pasal horror stories right
okay one of my friend have sixth sense dia boleh
like dia boleh nampak a few things like things that you cannot kita orang tak boleh nampak ah
so there was this one time kat dalam class
but then I just sat beside her except because kawan rapat kan no it was in primary school it was ah level eight so the teacher was like teaching okay lah macam biasa
then suddenly my kawan macam eh why is this guy standing outside from just now then I was like
pusing ah pusing tengok then I was like there's no guy there's no one
then I was like because um I'm quite macam rapat juga ah primary six and our class is at the eight level which is the highest level and
ya it's quite macam nanti ada connected to another building and that building quite
kosong there's no one it's empty ya so I was I was turning my head then I was like I saw no one then I was like I macam dah hyperventilate macam apa ini what is happening but um I quite rapat dengan dia so I know that she can see these things lah
again lah if he is he still standing there because mungkin it's just a person like just passing by or something lah going another class or just another parent ke tengah nak tunggu their child I don't know I just thinking a lot of possibilities situation ya then
not so clear like he's like just like macam bayang
and dia pakai baju black clothes clothing don't don't don't don't then okay okay then I ask my friend lah
like imagining stuff on like on my right side of the class so macam no I was supposed to be at end of the side because that was my friend kan so macam I wanted to sit beside her lah teman for that class for that lesson
tak akan nampak that thing macam I just don't want to see that thing macam tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh I don't want I don't want I don't want I just avoid looking at that
oh macam my humanity korang ah but then you don't
any humanitarian punya
you mean belakang as in the dekat dengan lift or
is it macam sebelah-sebelah or like face to face
sorang by sorang ke
but was the corridor like well lit or macam dark
okay so after that the third year engkau move out because with your aunty and then
ya but is it your own your own punya feeling or memang they are the one who gave you hints
tapi when you go back that time uh like it within that three years you and your mum you guys on okay terms or you guys don't talk at all or what
ya ya but you and her now dah okay lah
I think she has learnt to accept and agree to disagree lah you know why bro I I whatever you told me here right I can actually relate but mine didn't happen at a late stage in my life lah mine happened earlier ya like for example okay I was such a nerdy boy lah you know my two elder brothers were the naughty ones you know drop out before they completed secondary school kind ya but I was the one who was always the studious one so but okay my my my nakal my naughtiness is not like my brothers they are very active in terms of you know they they they skip school lah they get into they they start to steal from shop lah that kind of things my naughty was my mouth I like to I don't like to lose an argument ah so aku suka jawab jer you know so you know so my you know so as I grow older you know teenage teenage years is when you feel like you're already an adult you feel like you know what you doing so my ego kind of got in the way with my mum lah you know so there was a time that I even ran away for two weeks you know but that was my teenage days and then of course lah you know teenage and it became a pattern it became a habit like you lah you know you ended up becoming a fight often ah but for our case is not religious matters lah for me I think it's just I think it's just my mum's it's stuck in a is stuck in a psyche lah because she was a single mother for awhile
ah so she had to support three kids and two of them was extremely naughty she always have to and you know she's she has to play the father role ya so macam ah ya ya so I can understand her stress ah she was the old school hard knocks kind lah you know tunes you whack you left right centre you know like the kind lah if you go at your cousin's house right she just give you a stare you know you go back you die already you know that kind of fierceness lah so for me as I grow older I guess she also aged you know and um I think she kind of toned down a bit but she completely tone down only after I started to live alone
ah when I was like twenty one twenty one twenty two err I stayed at uh you know those government rental house ya I I stayed uh using uh someone's name lah ya because that person had was sick so she uh the nenek like vacated the house and I thought there was nobody so I stayed there for good one year plus lah ya but they wanted to hold the house because she still wants to go back after she recovers ya so for about one year plus I live separately but I mean I told my mum nicely lah I say I think I want my own space and it's it's closer for me to go to work cause that time I was part time bouncer and like my work is around the central area uh my my house was at outram there the old school jalan kukoh lah you know ya ya so when I stayed apart everytime I come back things got better ah
I think this is what they mean by distance makes the heart grow fonder right you know when you was you start to appreciate each other more of course she was unhappy you know because we were fighting a lot lah and then after that okay and then regarding the house I know what you mean by overstayed your welcome because okay uh when when I was in my early twenties kita actually nak pindah kita nak pindah rumah so by right we already moved to yishun way back already tau but then err this err it's a it's a chinese family lah so initially they're supposed to move out of their house while we move it so it's the fault of our agent because why did she go and confirm sell our house before we confirm get that house so what happen between that family was the mother got a dispute with the son so when the son move out the mother doesn't want to move out anymore
so we are stuck with no house ah so I had to stay for almost two years and my uncle's house like my whole family about like six seven of us we stay in one room lah my my uncle that my cousin give out his room for us lah but you can feel lah after awhile that they I mean they never fight they are very nice to us but you can feel like the energy is no longer like they can if some form of like rimas if I don't know if that's the right word ya so ya but they are nice about it ya so I totally can relate lah then after that I move to for five years so I realise that the same like you lah the over the overcome I mean the overstay welcome thing and the second thing also the fact that the more I'm distant with my mum the more we get along when I whenever I come back to see her
ya so like now when I come back due to COVID for the past six months right we never fight lah like we we we very cordial very civil ya ya ya like we really accepted and sometimes in fact last time wherever she met it will trigger a nerve tau but now no you know whenever she nag I'll just look at her alah she's aging already and then I will just tease her I'm like kenapa ni marah-marah tak penat ke you know
passionate ah kira defensive ah
the the title might be crude but the content is very good bro ya it teaches you about okay like for example right in in in like one day you only have so much F's to give you know there's only so much energy you can impose on so it's about what do you channel you your energy like which one which one which one you should matter more like for example they give an example lah uh you know like how sometimes people um okay like let's say you you you go inside a building there's a security guard sometimes you know some security guard can be very relax some very nya one the nya one ah actually they have a you should empathise with them you know they might look like as if their petty or whatever but it's because they they feel like that's the only time they can feel important they can feel like they have authority because throughout their life probably they never get that so they tend to super imposed on it that's why some people I don't know like for me I work in hotel line before ah wah sometimes when people in the level of managerial position ah are sometimes very guai lan you know bro dia orang
ya lah but no lah I truly mean it empathise lah kau jangan ketawa now you make me feel bad for laughing
eh but dude I thought all this while memang you were actually very motivated to be a pilot what no I mean like I I didn't know that I actually helped to contribute even a bit I didn't know I thought you were always like constantly motivated like you know this is the only thing that you want
so okay so what what how's your journey okay can you share your journey about macam mana kau jadi pilot or how you you let what from the beginning how did it all begin like not not when you were a kid tau not the interest tau the part where you start to casually start to enter become a pilot
oo sayangnya
eh no lah because new house you say you use mah you don't have to cash contribute what ada how much
eh but your setback like really like what I what what I like to say you know nasib kentang eh like like first okay lah the eyesight is a challenge okay never mind overcome already hernia is a challenge twice and then that hernia affected your flying and then after that when you were to fly the COVID pula happen like wow
your nasib is so kentang lah dude
nasib kau sangat kentang bro I don't know why I say kentang ah but I feel like it sounds right nasib kau kentang
another ujian
by then if if still got another factor by then I think I visit you at asylum already your always pretending to fly and then I'll go to salihin ni edwin jadi nyanyuk ready for take off and then the nurse come stewardess are you ready to fly
and then you have friends over there orang yang dalam asylum they will actually entertain you they will sit behind you siol lah funny sia
siol ah kau
it's the attitude of the top ten per cent people you know or not like they they never say die attitude you know I I realise like most of us okay I remember one story lah I don't know if I've ever told you this before there was a legendary pianist ah so she's like a old lady lah you know so she was having a final performance and then this young teenage girl like very early teenage lah like went to her got the backstage pass and said like you know one day I want to grow up and be just like you and then she literally just this old lady like she literally just macam smile casually and just said you know you're not the first person to have said that everybody say they wanna be like me but when it comes to putting in the hours that I put it nobody is willing to do as much you know which is true you know everyone wants to be reached but nobody is willing to fail you know
ya but that's about it bro eventually the one making the decision you can voice out ten thousand and one things like for example look at the the black lives issued right how many people get shot dead but what what actions have been taken nothing what you know so eventually it doesn't matter the only difference is you got more room to voice out that's it because if you go to like china you will say something wrong you kena arrest you go to saudi arabia you insult the king you kena arrest then tortured that kind of thing you know but democracy they just don't have that but ultimately the system underlying thing it's the same thing lah as you if your leader is shitty as a nation you gonna be shitty which is why I I respect the new zealand parliament right now even canada is also not too bad as as as on the surface as what I see lah
if you want to die if you wanna retire old can you know when you're old you go there and I'm half new zealand mah so aku anytime can just like you know eh
he's a new zealander but sekarang he stay in australia
no it's not about mahal bro even if it's not mahal you tell me how much does it cost to get a land to develop your own house to have the rooms that that you want to have entertainment already no
no yes no bro like I said yes but you have to understand macam mana if you want to bring the entertainment to you okay for example lah like my dream is to have like maybe a a big house over there you know and and um I have my own gym my own like like you cinematic rule you know of course ya but right now you ask me I can't even afford the flight ticket to go there bro
not true you see that's something people don't know it's not true no bro because no no bro that's the thing it's a misconception people don't understand bankruptcy okay let me tell you the most the most popular stigma that people think about bankruptcy okay they will say oh my house will kena tarik they will say oh I cannot get a job and then they will say I cannot travel and then they will say I cannot apply credit card back okay let me give you a check okay so bankruptcy does not affect your house if it's
the only reason how they can tarik your house if you never pay for your house that means your never never cut anymore you cannot service your monthly loan then the the can take away your house but banks cannot bro no other companies in on earth can actually pull your away unless
ya but you know so so first statement okay is a misconception people say your house kena tarik not true okay number two uh you you cannot travel okay if you see at ministry of law website they will say travel restriction okay you see if you understand how bankruptcy work let's say you apply bankruptcy uh I give you one one scenario lah one of one of this person oh like hundred over thousand so he got bankruptcy but bankruptcy you still have to pay over five years a certain small amount lah so like in this guy case is about three hundred a month
because your will still cut mah bulan-bulan for the house ah okay so so normally when people go through bankruptcy that that monthly payment if they pay they can still travel they just need to write in to their official assignee the one attached to their case they write in key in the details and whatever not they have to just submit their case and you just be able to travel bro these other things where okay I tell you ah bro you do not be surprised if somebody apply bankruptcy driving a lamborghini bro
bankruptcy they will for five to nine years lah depending on the amount that you have to pay err so for those who still maintain their monthly payment they can still travel but there are people who owe such a large amount that their monthly bankruptcy is still high probably thousand thousand plus a month so that one right they are the people like ah fuck it lah I don't want to pay aku tak nak bayar kau nak buat apa kau buat ah so if they never pay then they cannot travel
but it's not like so long in advance pun you know it's just like a day probably you know ah but the thing is people thought oh cannot that kind of thing
okay so two per cent of nine thousand seven it will tambah balik one nine four so you only end up paying one zero six per month so you will take four years eight months to clear ten thousand if you can only pay three hundred this is the best case scenario lah so imagine if people who owe forty fifty thousand okay lah let's say you you a newly married couple lah okay you you buy a house interior renovation design courts all this one time you spend can thirty forty fifty thousand already every month you must pay thousand plus two loans mah
okay already but it's not one hour not yet not yet a few more minutes okay okay habis kan another thing kan macam the second way let's say macam the minimum eh some people easily already every month must service this much so they cannot afford some because why they don't you don't forget if they got baby they got expenses the susu pampers all these things you know so your expenses might be a lot and your disposable income probably to three hundred only how you gonna pay this is when suddenly debt collector come lah lawyer letter come lah
so all these things we will educate our clients K what happens when debt collector chase you what happens when lawyer letter arrive when should you panic when should you not panic ah this is my the job of the debt solution centre we educate them on the law so the third option is when you need help you go you go mendaki you go see lah they will refer you to this place called credit counselling singapore no no no no is formed by the union of banks all the banks got together people thought it's a government body but it's not so why do they pushed this first even if you go or whatever because the economical structure of every country bro the biggest tax contributors are the banks so if people pay the banks the more they can tax the banks the more money goes to the country so it's better for the country lah ah so ah normally they have their debt consolidation plan lah that debt management program lah all these thing lah this is by the by the banks lah of course they still have interest okay the fourth way is the last resort which is avoid avoiding of bankruptcy through debt repayment scheme so that repayment scheme there's criteria lah you know you are eh aku rasa dah habis ah bro okay lah five second we count down you have anymore second bro okay okay done ah okay
habis I letak blanket
and then baru dia tidur betul-betul
mmhmm rimas

um I so penat I just I just went home straight
but too bad lah tak ada duit haven't gaji
I tak sure probably maybe I save dulu wait for another pay
nine wow kerja malam eh
mm tahu pun your fault
I ada project I ada exam so I have to like
sekarang the
the the first project was actually video editing then I I was like really rabak ah
I have someone to depend on kalau I tak tahu then you
dah lepas intern what's your plan
kerja part time ya I think most probably I'm going to look for like a full time job so I'll be like more secured you know
something like or engineering end up you nak go to like something yang tiada kena mengena before you studied
higher NITEC cert but I rasa kalau dah dapat diploma
tak apa lah like oh tak mahu berbual pasal kerja lah stress
the first place I want to go is actually just I nak
shopping and makan and just relax but it's like the nearest at least
like you buy your groceries ke you beli makan ke or you like even if you just uh stay at hotel over there
you dapat save money
I just wear anything selesa
um it was actually my first time pergi korea but mostly I buy is like their skincare cause
then you kalau like
there's in this if they continued the season four but haven't watched like I'm just going to let all the episodes keluar dulu then baru I tengok
wah inspired inspire apa
selain anime
like come on like you don't know like uh boys over flowers like the are are you sure you pernah tengok itu semua kan
ah I love but sekarang pun okay lah they still funny but
I don't is I think left with jong min I think if I tak salah lah
then from there like I get to know yang dia actually dalam A pink a girl group like so cute like you know like she totally got talent
bila-bila masa I watch soccer
like I I don't really minat soccer or football
I'm not really cerewet you know cerewet like about food
I I usually just eat just that the one thing that I don't like is asam pedas
if I see asam pedas I'd rather you know starve
but it's okay lah tak apa
malay food I eat it's just I tak suka asam pedas but if fast food
like no matter how many times I eat or how long I makan already I still go to McDonald's
like I'm sure I'm sure everyone favourites is McDonald tak ke
um selain McDonald leh
apa lagi eh
I suka
I suka anything yang macam chicken macam Wingstop ke Nene Chicken ke Four Fingers ke
but itu semua like if you eat
a lot of times you get jelak so
I think I have been I think is it the one yang
they got sell like all the you know the mee goreng mamak combo is it with the cheese fries is it is it is that where adam's corners is
hmm is there like tebu over there you know tebu
no lah bamboo and tebu is lain
tebu is sugar cane
apa lah
okay lah so jadi over there I should get like the maggi goreng combo
uh no ada dah dah habis dah she ya I think if sekarang I think is every friday I think the
the cerita is uh I think is called
lesung if I'm not wrong you can try you can try uh tune in every friday dekat suria
like I feel like I watch once a month sahaja no lah I'm not into
like the drama and all if I watch also I just watch it through like Netflix ke Viu or YouTube tu jer
now now I tak
tengok apa-apa cause I like actually I am busy
like morning kerja then
bangun makan tidur kind of thing you know
uh still still lama lagi I think now like
ah like you know like I say myself is chill but yourself is called you know cari nahas
huh you tak sabar nak pergi malaysia I can't wait to remove the mask
really cannot tahan already people really need to follow like
ah cannot be anything I'm sure like mesti dia macam
ya but you can only use your own voucher I think you must add up with pakai cash
go sentosa untuk apa
dia naik habis suddenly dia turun
what tak ada kena mengena car and roller coaster
who said I tak suka car I like car
people boleh bahagi masa dia orang to to be into this
so let's let's just tahan a bit
like you know there's you people say macam uh there's like there's a
or apa the rainbow comes first something like that lah I forget I lupa
it became forty minutes what the hell and then I like sesat sia I was like so I was so stressed I scared simon angry cause I make I always make him wait
like what if he marah at me and he doesn't want to hang out with us anymore
uh he's kinda mad at me about that like merajuk he merajuk he kata
like cause during the weekends err weekdays tak dapat jumpa then weekend also like I also busy
we were hang up till five and then uh I went home and then I woke up at like twelve then I called him and ask him if he wanted to come along and he say ya he wants to come along but he says but he's like half-awake so I was like never mind lah you just sleep I'll go with sharinah and simon and then after that I tell him lah then after that I want to do my school stuff abeh he macam like upset
then I also macam like annoyed lah pasal he yesterday he cakap he nak hantar you know like he want to fetch me and send me here like and then last minute he say like last minute he like still sleeping then I like ah fuck it lah I'm just going go myself then I don't know so that was a bad start to the day
no lah I tell him already I I sampai then he never reply
oh oh there's one the nice one the one the dua tingkat right
what's what does simon want to do nak buat apa
then you kena tunggu ah how long was the simulation
ah that's not bad tak tunggu lama ah
I mean even when you're not influenced even if you're not drunk tak mabuk you still cannot predict what that's so funny
cause they already like nak masakkan you then is that it
you makan apa seh kat situ azizi still got
he buncit already meh
ah pasal dia punya percentage for exams is the they um turunkan for exams so they put it at every other uh like assignments quizzes so they increase the percentage there so it's heavier for the assignment than quizzes it used to be like five percent now the quizzes are like ten percent that's whole grade leh babe
so like I have to do properly lah then I taking I taking four modules sia babe like fucking busy I'm so sorry for saying that word but but I'll be so busy tak ada time
ya so I'm telling aqil like I'm gonna be busy I tak ada time for him sometimes like for during the weekdays
he gets it tapi dia pun sedih ah sometimes
ah dia macam kalau I boleh buat you pun boleh buat gitu ah
ya I think gitu ah
lain ah lain I cannot sia like he that time he also he only one module lah then I got four modules
cause the other day he was asking me eh err do you have lobang for like then it's like aiya syrinah boleh cari sendiri ah but like you know the previous place I worked at the dyslexia association of singapore they they paying quite high oh now lah
ya it's macam learning centre punya timing ah but it's lepak ah the job is it's damn lepak
no babe it will like strain your body sia then you want to have baby camne nak have a baby if you're gonna be tired all the time
then you can just hantar him lah
tinggal mana seh babe
that's so freaking far from dari bishan pergi choa chu eh pergi his ah camp is kat mana
like you beg her that's what I would do I would pujuk her I'll cium her kaki sia to kasi the bilik
it's like girl I'll get you an iphone and ipad anything you want just let me have the room five days a week you just live in the hall for five days a week a few nights a week and then on the weekends you can have it wah susah sia tak ada rumah sendiri I swear it's damn hard
wah then must tahan like this for satu tahun
no wonder simon kata want to get his own car the other day
it's not cheap sia babe tu hari I tolong top up kan aqil punya minyak cause he was driving me around so I offered to bayar for the minyak ah I only kasi fifty dollars and it's like
what the hell it's so mahal sia their minyak the fuel consumptions is like shit
it's mahal as shit man I swear it's like honestly bike
like I I tengok also if like
and it's all the way at the lim chu kang there sia what bus will pergi sana
tak payah lah oh my god you know what I think right it's a good thing that you're not working right now because you can like hantar simon
sleep in or you know not the one to trouble you but kesian sia he he like I also will think like
but it's only like um august september october november lima lima bulan jer tinggal then after that you guys can like like breathe a little right
the doa the berkat the berkat from the family like you know like another I don't know lah to me doesn't matter as long as got I don't need my makciknya berkat it's okay god sees me and god loves me so that's fine
I feel like as long as ya I feel like if you're pregnant tak yah sudah it's like forgo the whole idea but since you're not pregnant you know planning planning
right so are they agreeable to return you the duit after kalau in december tak boleh hold a wedding are they going to return the money
but that like dengki sia
oh masih tu ah
I think you should like list down all the deposits as you meet them macam everything tau you list down from A to Z how much exactly you have spent and you have paid for and then you include like what their what's the stand of the vendors like are they willing to uh and then you also include like you you um macam if you get pregnant then how you gonna get married you can get married like can have a wedding and then but then they will open it till twenty twenty one then like how sia you nak macam it's a lose-lose situation for you in all in all aspects lah like you still going to lose money sia
and at this time leh macam
macam like you lost thousands of money eh just because like orh the company need to earn money the company didn't give you anything back
it's not even your fault sia it's not even your you and simon's fault you guys are like preparing for it and then like had had it been uh how it was planned I feel like it wouldn't be this stressful or this difficult by now like everything should have settled down you know like the majlis are over like you get duit salam you know
I told aqil I had no expectations like kalau dia nak kahwin kahwin ah but other than that I'm just thinking at my own time ah cause like I'm not trying to find someone to settle down to start a family with like
of course tapi I tak nak macam okay I need to find a man yang I boleh kahwin no it's like I want to find a man that I love and then slowly everything will uh fall into place lah like if if we kahwin then kahwin like but ultimately I feel like uh it's important that aqil and I learn about each other first and like trust each other and like be accepting ah of one another
so like we end up finish right now where we're just trying to figure each other out so pelan-pelan ah
because we are exclusive kita tak cakap we we kita tak berbual dengan orang lain like we love each other like we see a future in each other tapi um
so he say ah like let's celebrate or officiate um hujung tahun
tapi kan babe but there are certain things that I'm still not used to I tak biasa like him looking at my phone
he must see me siapa text he must see me siapa call
I'm not used to that and then he's like I nak tengok your gallery I was like is this what my friends do his eyes are all ugh in my mind like low key I'm still like single because like mentally like I'm trying to like you know
oh right so anyway like in december he kata like he wanna get promise rings that he says that he want to get promise rings for us like start working towards marriage and then I macam oh then he cakap ah actually dia dah start saving like he's very uh thrifty like
like a lot of things happen because of him like macam me and my parents like ya like me and my parents
then I was really sad cause during my birthday dorang tak wish I um
I know like I know he's an adult like I know dia boleh jaga diri dia sendiri dia dah besar like he'll be fine but on the low-key I still like think about him sometimes like is he okay like is he eating well is he like
so like I was so sure of hassan ah I wanted to fight it out fight it out for him oh my god okay I nak bilang you something ah yesterday yesterday semalam I told aqil this I say I cakap dengan aqil um
it's so crazy like how like at peace I am with how things like how things um tertulis ah lah like is everything tertulis what like
belum I belum delete I still I still masih ada kat phone
dekat my phone
kenapa I tak tahu I tak tahu asal I tak delete
I I tak nak tengok ah the gambar-gambar like it makes
kau nak but
that's like trying to be macam they are trying to
lepas tu um dah kahwin after a few after a few years dah penat like pretend to be someone that you're not
cakap melayu lah okay so itu saja tentang hassan
ah tentang hassan dan aqil
oh I still macam sedih seh you and simon tak pergi honeymoon
the thing yang I akan look forward to right
thai pancake sedap dok thai pancake
ya but krabi punya water activities mm lame juga ah
I nak ikut I nak ikut mak dan ayah
tak boleh itu honeymoon
okay abeh atas I tell my parents I go with you then over there we separate
then kat sana kita separate
kalau pergi krabi
ah ah kita I tell
I tell my parents that I go dengan you then kat kat sana then I separate lah dengan aqil lah
no tapi nak buat like you can do your own things boleh buat benda sendiri boleh
lepak jer water activities makan lepak
you don't like macam buat activity
tapi macam sightseeing pergi like hiking pergi like um visit temples and shit
I'm okay to like shop like maybe half a day or like two hours or three hours kalau the whole day nak pergi shopping I boring seh like bosan gila
macam restless as err especially if like I tak cause I don't really like shop much
if I don't have anything that I like then boring gila seh
I feel like kita should go
buat anak dekat bali
uh kalau kita empat pergi bali aqil dengan I kita pergi uh ee kita get high
kita get high on shrooms kita get high on mushrooms
orh yesterday um we saw aqil ah class like classmates schoolmates at marina barrage then they're like he was with his girlfriend oh my god the girlfriend cantik gila sia I was like freak look like girl crush as fuck and then like uh ya melayu but she doesn't look malay I think she's mixed then
I like macam like I say hi ah but I like frozen a bit so tell I a bit shy cause like I'm flustered and then aqil was like are you like shy then I was like no I just I couldn't tell him that I'm like like I'm secretly crushing on your friend's girl
because right babe when we duduk in the car aqil need to on the aircon and then it will run on fuel so like
I am not complaining ah cause I also don't mind the aircon his car anyway I tak complain lah pasal I pun nak aircon the kereta dia anyway so up to you lah you nak on aircon I okay jer you nak waste nak waste gas
but I think one thing that I need to like um get used to is dia punya cemburu
ya like he tells me he's not a jealous person dia cakap dia tak jealous tapi
bila I cakap pasal like my guy friends or like shah shah sia shah is like the most platonic friend like he's the most respectful friend ever
then like he gets like kind of jealous then macam oh maybe because he doesn't have many like girlfriends and even if he does they're not good looking
like to me I tak jealous pasal like you can have as many girlfriends as you want
like to me it's like uh old friends that's fine if you if you found a new girlfriend that one I'll be suspicious but old friends to me is like kalau you nak dengan dorang you dah lama dah dengan dorang
so like the fact that you and dorang tak together that means like you guys don't want don't have anything lah between you
I punya timer five three two eight
orh pasal aqil tak practising like he doesn't know the basics babe
he was saying like I love your daughter I'm working hard ah to earn a a stable income and I'm also working to better myself as a muslim then I was like oof damn cause he dulu tak pernah puasa then he say for the last two years he's been puasa full lah
so macam
especially practising muslim so macam like ah but macam I have friends who like drink but then they go solat jumaat
then it's like ya then it's not morals but I think it's more of like his view on people like dia dia punya
pendirian ah like dia rasa like it's okay for him to do it because dia tak practise he's not a practising muslim tapi kalau kawan dia buat kawan dia practise practise religion then itu salah so like I don't wanna ya so like macam oh okay like that's your view too
gasak kau lah nak buat apa you you dah besar you tahu apa salah apa betul apa so I tak kesah ah dia nak buat apa
not my responsible to tegur you because you dah tahu all this you dah tahu and like siapa I nak tegur you know
so I think part yang dia like in terms of I'm just scared macam my parents ada high expectations on aqil like they
they nak ni nak tu then they will they will I scared they feel like aqil is not a good enough person to like
can be my husband which is not fair lah pasal they say that based on their own checklist when it should be on my checklist because it's for me
like I yang nak kahwin pe
I think my my parents punya fear is also because like if I get married they're passing all their responsibility of me to that guy
so they are scared that that guy don't care about his responsibility on me not just like monetary wise not just like health but in terms of preparation for the after life lah like once kita dah
meninggal like you know that kind of thing
macam tak sincere jer
then if like in december if my parents are okay then we will like apply for house you know look for our macam we will start planning lah like properly macam
apply for house then like um because aqil just started working so his is tak banyak
I feel like I feel like aqil is very very reasonable dan dia punya like
dia tak macam kata dia kata dia tau dia like dia dia will dengar cakap orang then after that he will like process and then he would
macam be with
like as a partner dia
dia faham like the what is understanding in malay babe
the job punya name if I'm not wrong it was apa tu
it should be ah or siapa-siapa yang boleh faham ah melayu
ya but the job punya
the job punya description wah was not that not that bad uh
transcriptions oh sorry err listen to audio punya files
no I think it's like maybe macam punya type of thing uh
ya ya basically ah but I think there's also another aspect of macam
err natural language processing punya
because kan you know ada ada debate kan whether language is
err nature or nurture macam whether there is a biological foundation for language
the brain punya mechanics in obtaining language and I think they want to see whether they can apply that to ke tak whether the can learn
because my results kan belum keluar
if I apply then like a bit weird uh but I'm quite sure I will pass lah so I think tak ada hal kalau nak apply jer
special education punya teacher
because I fall into the macam the
only one exam was quite difficult uh the other three macam
gitu-gitu jer uh okay ah I did two of them quite well err
but at the same time kalau dia rooted in theory
that means if you don't get everything you won't get the highest punya score possible
oh so macam what are your strengths what are your weaknesses gitu ah
wait he got cut off oh because the break up room punya time was ending
sebarang jer siol leave in the middle of the thing
but then it's not like it's the benda ni compulsory kan
belajar belajar all the way like for hours and hours straight
for the eighteenth century punya lit
it's work for me throughout the four years uh for all my lit punya courses ah plus I hate lit uh so
biar lah dia
tak menyibuk lah dia
left maksud
oh kejap pause
but the appointment pukul enam pagi
nak kena siap apa seh you just need to go over to the location pe
okay so he's not actually baru ah macam gitu
so so your shift doesn't deal with macam punya barang-barang ah
apa and oo
kirakan dia lost ah
kita orang macam chair destroyers eh
I mean even on your off days also most likely kena tidur kan
it's like a fake fake off not I think it's a I think it's a shift punya thing uh pasal dulu nasri pun bila dia tengah kerja shift
macam even on his off days his time was taken up by
tidur dulu because you need you need that that rest before you can actually
wait so so you mean different punya clients
I think especially because macam lain-lain punya organisation ada lain-lain punya processes
so macam
solid base to work from within your own organisational punya itu
like it's dependent on the client rather than the itu
what what do you mean kena macam tu eh apa
first come first serve siapa nak ni dia cakap dulu gitu
pukul lima five in the morning
and you don't want to be the kind yang
tanya tanya tanya macam oi you want or not eh you want or not gitu
like I have a feeling like usually the one yang step up is you and not all all those other people yang itu
pasal kan ada apa budak baru nama jaden kan abeh seniors dia jaded
so jaden dengan jaded sama-sama
never mind never mind let them cringe janji janji kita punya audio dorang dapat
no no no it's like it's like bila kita orang dua orang jer berbual macam
kalau orang melayu apa ah
ada ada ada there's a there's a uh there's a phrase I think for for home wreckers
macam like like ah is it
is it kayu tiga
I think it's kayu tiga
oh okay lah betul lah I mean we we're having
I mean maybe the design of dia punya blocks also plays a part lah
but at the same time tak kan you shouldn't be banging stuff when it's so close to time orang nak balik rumah
tak kan orang sia-sia jer ketuk-ketuk siol
banyak ah anime
weeaboo kalau melayu apa weeaboo
kalau indo weeaboo
part dia pun belum sampai dalam anime dia
they had they had to stop for a while pasal COVID
uh apparently january next year in japan lah tapi kat singapore belum tahu ah
they have their own I'm quite sure they have their own macam
cinema punya based cloud storage that helps them to transfer everything
is it but then again like with film you can see like there's a lot of uh apa
err to do with the film ah let's say macam kalau dah habuk ke apa sikit then you can see brief flashes on the
from the film itself abeh nanti macam
tak lawa ah dia punya tu
ya ya that's the thing macam kalau film it's like
you are actually projecting it based on light and the and the image not the pixel punya density
like with digital all like you are constrained by dia punya
the pixels ah and the resolution that it was framed at ah macam you know lord of the rings
is because dia punya digital effects were actually rendered in ten eighty P
takde ah but it weren't limited like if you if you film
but all the and the extra extra punya barang-barang
was err ten eighty P punya rendering so if they were to upscale that to four K
the problem would be whether apa tu
dorang nak bikin balik tak semua dia punya effects
or whether dorang nak apa
err just use the existing punya rendering
and then upscale to four K tapi macam buruk ah macam zoom zoom in gitu ah that's the kind of effect
ah ya ya ya macam stretched gitu
tunggu ah dia
ah ya lah you have an eye for the frame I will write I will write in the script macam mana dia punya scene develops
you know like the three quarter removed punya angle or like
macam the kubrick punya
stanley kubrick punya follow through the halls
no tak nak tak nak
tapi macam kenyang ah boleh ah Gong Cha
how to work the camera to achieve that itu
I think director director macam gitu is
dah successful dah ada banyak duit then
the ego that comes with it is itu uh
I think it can go anywhere ah doesn't necessarily have to be macam
horror or itu it can be like it can be like drama
the person and the nature of the person macam who are you gitu
macam telling you
the the thing that I like about the original punya jurassic park is
that that err that apa
it kind of moves beyond macam like what what constitutes
like how you know there was a scene of the guy yang dia dia
err apa ada T-rex
then after that dia abandoned budak-budak then after that dia terus dia lari masuk toilet then T-rex gigit kepala dia
it's like err macam
I only remember the beautiful shots of the itu
and the shots with the with the ghost woman also macam lawa gitu
it's very macam ethereal
I cannot remember but it was the director of pengabdi setan
but I I want to watch pengabdi setan ah where to watch ah
because I I took the scriptwriting punya course apa
you make the film I write the script dah settle ah
like next year because tu apa tu
like my monitor punya resolution terlalu tinggi for the for the card
so macam I need a stronger card
isn't it like thirty plus bucks and black friday sale coming so I think confirm murah punya maybe like thirty thirty-ish maybe less
I know rehan that time buy on sale thirty seven murah
that's why it's so macam itu
sebab I don't like it ah because all the mat reps semua macam tengok macam uh demon slayer demon slayer
boleh beli dari AliExpress pe
of the thing because it's actually dia macam
macam with real respect for people punya feelings and not just some
random rom com yang dorang macam sebarang rojak letak kat dalam ni semua abeh mix mix mix abeh
janji kelakar habis ah
but at the same time like you must also consider macam kat japan kan
yang the source material dorang punya manga ke
dia punya light novel ke visual novel ke pe
has to be actually very popular dalam its own format
or sampah habis
different ke
so sahaja jer ah dia ambil
oh dia muda eh
husband dia singaporean pe
oh abeh dia just dapat kerja kat sini ah
maybe dia punya dia tak kasi basis book tak suka ah
wait dia tinggal kat mana
as in as in in indonesia dia tinggal kat mana
boleh eh
try uh nanti
you watch the show then after that you tell me you tell me what it is next time eh kita kita cari korean punya movie
wait so so far your your korean punya tu sampai tahap apa
as in like dia punya apa tu
boleh understand adult punya language ke
macam hyperinflation
came first sebelum writing
dia punya shine through lawa tak
oh macam too good to be true gitu ya
ah ya I mean it's not lucky lah it should fit because it's all out punya key cap apa
alamak minta tolong apa
alamak tutup eh tapi today today saturday kan normally weekend sabtu ahad buka apa okay mm
doesn't matter where tapi nak kena dekat ke nak delivery ke nak apa
mm I think for me kalau recommendation I recommend just nearby kalau since you're going out already might as well pergi to err minang minang
I forgot the name ah minang house I think minang or minang house I know of a few so that one yang popular dia dekat dengan masjid sultan just in front so kalau you masuk from the
eh from the back I think boleh tapi from the side lah the side gate you just park there then
masuk maybe like lima minute jalan lima minute
then mesti nampak mm mm
selalu long queue lah every time tapi the only thing is you have to go with your parents early lah kalau tidak lunch time selalu wah the queue is like gila like oh my god like you can see
I don't know dua puluh orang dalam queue
tak boleh tak boleh buat reservation ah just queue I mean I don't see them taking reservation lah because dia punya tempat macam macam biasa macam kedai kopi tapi dia macam atas punya kedai kopi sikit ah cause boleh ada two storey so and it's like a shophouse so definitely I don't think they take reservations but
ya lor just walk in lor but I mean kalau you want just go maybe pukul sebelas
mm ya sebelas setengah sebelas setengah for lunch tapi because dinner normally err I think tutup
um ya so I think kalau nasi padang kalau nak makan fresh you makan lunch lah jangan pergi dinner dinner
susah lah kalau nasi kalau you know lauk kalau basi sakit perut seh
tapi tu apa tu err singaporean yang buka apa
ke indonesian
orh okay interesting I mean cause from what I know kalau nasi padang normally lah selalu lunch kalau dinner I don't know I mean the the other one that I know is at paragon tapi that one is in a mall lah
and be be prepared to pay like I don't know I don't know I on average lah macam empat puluh lebih lima puluh lebih because dalam paragon you know lah it's an atas mall so tambuah mas
tu also very popular because last time you know lah tourist selalu pergi and then
err I think it's at basement basement one or basement one or two lah hmm so you can expect the place to be a bit more atas lah
ya lah you know lah situ beli gucci lah lah prada lah ya lah kalau ada duit lah kalau tak ada duit then different story lah tengok-tengok jer boleh lah kan tengok tak ada tak tak ada duit apa tak minta duit eh
mm try lah I think that one is one of the popular ones but I think makan situ lagi sedap
eh lepas ni nak pergi mana
pergi shopping ke
go earlier lah nowadays because aiya you know lah sekarang because of the pandemic alamak macam macam like nak masuk mall jer nak check in check out then like ambil temperature lah abeh mall lain habis store lain
abeh every store you go you have to take your temperature my god it's like I mean after awhile I don't know for you and your parents but I like for me when I go with my mum it's like penat seh just masuk keluar masuk keluar
like non stop and then kalau tak kalau tak ambil temperature tak ambil tak masuk dekat safe entry thing tak boleh masuk
even if you want to go for like five minutes also tak boleh
I don't know whether you experience that before some shops okay and then some shops tak okay I'm like really like come on lah like give chance a bit lah like you know but I guess everyone has to take it seriously lah that is true tapi macam kelakar because at the beginning bila this started semua orang macam alamak kanchiong kanchiong spider you know macam alamak
okay how ah macam how to check in how know contact tracing lah this and that and then after that after awhile
I think right the best kalau ada duit beli online sudah
uh uh betul memang memang my mum also experience that before dia beli apa lah kelakar it's not just baju eh it's like barang-barang rumah sekali after that dia punya colour lain and then dia punya size pun lain
ada boleh lah ada like macam all those order macam order from china all that how to how to return back seh
no gambar cantik selalu gambar cantik makanan pun sama every time kalau order grab dia punya gambar alamak macam photoshopnya wah it's really like damn atas the photo
and then sekali datang like that time okay it's funny that time eh I'm sure you mesti you ada story pasal like failed grab delivery punya apa tu
punya orders my god my my time bila I mean my experience so far is like oh my god
like it's really crazy like okay example leh that time I beli ayam penyet and then you know what happen nasi tak datang boleh gitu order ayam penyet nasi ayam penyet tau tapi nasi
tak ada and then bila bila complain dengan dia orang firstly dia orang tak angkat phone abeh dah dah gitu and then nak tanya lah
mana mana nasi kan nasi ayam penyet mana ada orang order nasi lemak tak ada nasi order nasi ayam tak ada nasi tak kelakar
and then dah lapar and then after that dia orang boleh cakap oh I think the nasi dia orang either dia orang lupa atau driver makan huh tak I don't know nak mengamuk ke nak ketawa ke nak apa
you imagine if it's you kalau if it's your if you are in my shoes tak marah
nak nak tunggukan nasi and then takkan so the the kelakar part is the kelakar part of the story is what know
bila I call them to go and say that the nasi tak ada and then dia cakap so you want me to refund you the rice or you want me to refund you the money so I said you have experience before or not the rice never come with your meal
depends on what I don't know whether to let's say ah tak tahu nak mengamuk ke nak marah ke and then
kalau nak tunggu nasi dia cakap apa tau dia cakap ma'am because right the restaurant err a lot of order ah ma'am and then the driver also not many so you have to wait ah maybe one or two hours untuk satu nasi I'm like ah
tak payah lah in the end my mum masak nasi sendiri ah so thanks lah so I then but the funny part is one week later this they send me email to say that hi ma'am we have refund you the money for the rice that's all so it's you know how much is the rice one dollar twenty cent thank you thanks grab
satu jam eh eh kalau I mesti dah
dah membara you know like dah lapar abeh dah mengamuk
abeh still nak tunggu satu jam eh tak payah sudah tak payah sudah itu beli mcdonald's sudah
ya lah masak nak masak boleh tapi nak nak clean up tu nak bersihkan eh tak payah lah
ah wah mesti crowded gila ah
abeh huh cancel
eh eh jahatnya sedih
so I think also susah lah macam the restaurant nak blame the driver and then the driver blame the restaurant then in the end siapa yang suffer seh
dia punya gaji bukannya berapa seh kesian mm mm
tu lah I mean I selalu tengok dia orang penat-penat datang dengan basikal lah dengan motor lah dengan kereta lah and then
selalu macam you can see that they're always in a rush like they're always like trying to go that trying to hurry themselves to the next delivery you know what I mean
ya so macam nak mengamuk-mengamuk dengan dia orang pun alamak macam susah you know macam kesian ah macam memang memang ni dia orang punya dia orang punya
apa tu dia orang punya job lah like tapi tak tahu eh macam let's say so is like I feel in the end the restaurant they blame the driver and then driver blame restaurant then in the end customer suffer lah
eh eh baiknya lah eh eh siapa seh tak nak pergi rumah dia gitu as in tip in cash or huh oh my god
mm mm betul
mm betul
mm mm betul
tu lah lambat lambat kenapa ni kenapa tu semua still ada comment lah singaporeans standard lah kalau tak complain bukan singaporean apa
susah lah nak order macam like that time baru my friend order apa eh I think dia order
susah kalau I mean that time my friend pun cakap cakap pasal nasi padang eh that time my friend order during bulan puasa ah during fasting month ramadan time I think just like two three months ago and then they order in bulk lah because dia orang ada macam
apa macam err open house eh bukan open house macam
err family gathering I mean as as small as the gathering can be lah you know following the guidelines and all that and then the funny part is dia hantar banyak rumah so they order macam maybe like four packet like empat packet satu rumah
so altogether maybe about empat puluh packet they just put you know lah
malay family banyak kan
so dia baik hati lah because like one of the days dia nak macam dia nak apa tu nak belanja nak belanja makan so they order to ten household and then out of the ten maybe half of the makanan basi ah dia punya sayur dia bungkus sekali sayur dia boleh basi and then macam mana bulan puasa orang nak orang nak buka nak makan
so dia punya order datang pukul empat
and then dia buka pukul tujuh tujuh tujuh setengah tujuh lima belas and then after that makanan dia basi so satu hari puasa abeh makanan basi tak sedih
ah abeh yang kelakar punya yang the the funniest part of all is that the owner of that coffee I mean of that err food stall dia boleh cakap apa tau oh err sorry ah to customer who got the food that is basi
ah ah so also kelakar lah because okay lah kalau macam restaurant maybe
maybe they can give you macam a bit of refund or what lah but because they are
correct and then nasi I mean okay nasi padang eh maybe on average maybe about five dollars but during the fasting month eh plus the delivery and everything my my friend paid about hundred plus tau then imagine half of the nasi basi macam mana gitu
tak ada tak ada tak ada refund tak ada dia boleh cakap oh we just hope the customer can understand and that's it so ya lah tu lah kesian and then it's like macam
pergi mana cycling kat mana seh
boleh juga lah eh tapi esok sunday seh confirm banyak orang
oh masih
ah ah sama mountain bike ah sama tak tak tak tukar
mm I think makan apa err cinema tempat wayang kan masih tutup kan oh dah buka eh tapi dia punya gambar semua macam gambar dulu-dulu jer siapa seh nak tengok
mm mm I think sekarang that day I think what lima puluh or something like that
boleh lah sounds like a plan bro
eh tapi kat changi banyakkan dia punya tempat yang nasi lemak macam semua semua best nasi lemak so semua semua kalau tanya mana satu yang bagus dia cakap ah semua semua famous tak tahu I think I don't know like five
six five or six stalls there right that jual nasi lemak or is it is it more than that I can't remember dah lama seh tak pergi makan changi tapi as usual kalau nak tanya orang
mana best nasi lemak semua best ah depends ah yang mana depends on apa like you suka tapi more or less sama apa selalu nasi ayam ikan timun sambal dah kan apa apa yang beza dia
kan unless it's sama apa kalau nasi lemak I mean okay lah the good thing is that dia punya price there is like macam dua I think two dollars three dollars maybe ya
uh uh dia punya nasi punya banyak I always I always ingat dia punya ada dia punya stall kasih lauk banyak abeh ada nasi macam macam walao like mountain like that know makan tak habis
mm ya lah standard kalau makcik kalau kasi wah very generous then kalau senyum-senyum sikit nanti mesti dapat lebih
okay boleh mm
okay lah boleh lah hopefully tak hujan seh sekarang kalau weather you know lah macam unpredictable that day punya lah panas I think I check the temperature you know what's the temperature thirty four degrees seh thirty four degrees tapi
kalau you tengok iphone punya app kan dia punya degrees ada macam ada macam feels like ah macam macam actually
feels like is forty two eh wah forty forty two dah macam dekat dubai seh
ah ah tu lah it's like and then kelakar kan because nowadays bila panas very hot and then when it's raining it's like raining like flooded did you saw that time dekat dekat singapore I think kat mana entah changi ke pasir ris ke bedok the rain sampai flooding sampai banjir and then the banjir is so bad that
at the bus stop dia punya orang is standing on the seat eh
and the air naik all the way tau
macam bukan kat singapore seh
a'ah betul a'ah betul betul
ya and then I saw seh banyak orang macam video
and apa tu banyak orang video of the incident that happen then like one of them is so funny because kan at that point of time you it's like I think I don't know lah since circuit breaker or something like that
or phase one or something then the dia punya it was so bad that they there was water inside the bus leh and then they said they say nevermind it's okay that is close you can still take this bus because the water was like ankle deep you know
can you imagine so it's like you are literally it means if you wear shoes or slippers habis lah
basah kuyup seh habis ah
kesian uh uh tu lah that's why it's like really not like singapore seh
and then means weather forecast semua salah lah
tu lah like today I saw the weather forecast actually suppose to rain dia cakap actually suppose hujan sampai tuesday ah next tuesday tuesday or wednesday then today punya lah panas mana tak dengue kat singapore
weird leh no but talking about dengue oh my god seriously the dengue cases did you saw I was just I was just telling my friend that day pasal the dengue case and then one of my colleague boleh kena dengue seh uh uh and the kelakar part dia mat salleh
dia dia asyik I think dia asyik keluar petang ah pergi jogging ke apa entah lah tak ingat lah apa dia cakap abeh dia cakap oh I I was out sick for one week so I said lah how are you so I thought maybe um like he fever ke cause you know lah nowadays kalau sakit it's like either you kena COVID nineteen or you kena
dengue and then the funny part is dia cakap dia kena dengue
uh uh confirm and then dia dah takut because they dia ingatkan that kena masuk hospital lah so actually tak payah because I think you have to self isolate for seven days
I I I don't know how he got it I think dia cakap that maybe because dia selalu keluar petang ah dia keluar petang to go jogging around dia punya area and dia standard lah dia tinggal dia tinggal kat robertson quay you know that near to the clarke quay boat quay area ah then after that
err don't know how he balik and then dia macam dia pening lah abeh dia batuk-batuk lah and then dia macam
dia rasa macam something is wrong lah so dia cakap actually dia pergi doctor first time then doctor say oh maybe you're just tired because dia sekarang kan everybody work from home ah then after that dia ingatkan
okay lah maybe I'm just tired I don't have enough sleep blah blah blah and then in the end dia pergi to another doctor the doctor cakap dengue then dia dah panic lah
so dia macam eh macam mana ni macam mana seh so dia dia takut that dia kena hospitalize lah because kalau hospitalize most likely you can be in the ward if like let's say you get dengue maybe instead one week it becomes two weeks
p[a'ah tu lah and then nowadays you know lah kalau ambil is not like those days lah ah like dulu kalau tak nak pergi kerja pergi I mean ambil boleh lah one two days stay at home sekarang is like your name might be on the record you know and then your boss semua tahu habis seh
is it tapi dia orang datang hari-hari tak
abeh macam mana seh dia orang nak check macam I mean you see the the mosquito is so small how they want to check like okay lah I know they can check for the eggs and all that but how can they check because
I saw like err kat apa tu at the west side I think yishun or what is one of the hot spot
and then like every other day ada fogging ah
and then fogging you know lah the smell oh my god and it's like everybody work from home it's like my friends who are staying in yishun and woodlands they say every other day ada fogging
and the whole house will smell of the fogging smell macam nak muntah seh and it's like I don't know don't know that's why I'm thinking like how can they see the mosquito can they see I don't know or maybe they got their own equipment is it
my mum even funnier bila dia dengar pasal these dengue cases and then like because that day I read it was ten thousand so then when I was talking to my ang moh colleague the the guy then his then err he said he doesn't know lah that because they ang moh apa he from sweden ah dia tak dia tak dia tak baca local news sangat lah baca pasal COVID nineteen COVID nineteen
and the pandemic and everything that's happening in the world lah then but then he never read about the dengue then he said oh I didn't know that dengue was a very big thing so I said ya it's actually ten thousand cases sekali I read on the day itself is already more than twenty two thousand cases eh it's crazy my god
tapi macam mana seh
macam mana nak tengok kalau even if your eyesight is like perfect eyesight macam mana nak tengok
by the time they want to gigit you they just gigit
so leceh lah sekarang kalau kalau sakit then susah tau nak kena pergi doctor lah nak kena self self isolate lah then macam-macam ah like macam-macam test seh nak kena
nak kena ambil is like it's a good thing if you don't get sick nowadays but now this this I mean getting sick you know lah is hard to predict right ya so kalau dah
I don't know lah just keep healthy lah ah just keep on exercising makan betul-betul jangan makan all the
he just drink water a lot everyday because dia tak ada medicine for dengue there's no cure just like COVID nineteen scary ah
macam-macam lah nowadays
and it's like during a pandemic and then like you don't see the end you know like every other day mesti ada something you know and it's only what august oh my god
ya lah ya lah betul susah lah
ya lor that's why how seh they check everyday like that tak penat ke macam
mm mm ya lah that's why that's why the dengue also increase because I was just reading that construction work has stopped right and then you see lah the weather like panas lah hujan lah then all the air bertakung like that then mana tak dengue seh ya then there's nobody like
because my house area ada banyak new flats all the flats and all that so all the construction you can see like there's no more
construction going on like it's so quiet like all the new blocks macam seram seh like so quiet mm so I guess lah because of that also ya they never really check on the construction sites
more and more ya mm mm betul lah correct
ah ah betul lah kesian eh
mm mm tu lah makan maggi jer lah hari-hari they are also heroes ah mm mm
no lah work from home lah because office tak buka then how
mm mm kat raffles leh oh my god
sama ah
mm mm tu lah
correct and then kalau you know lah kalau lunch time situ not only crowded like raffles and area I mean most times you are like spending so much on your lunch like you know you know lunch you know the lunches are like what
ten to fifteen dollars on average and then and that's like every other day kalau makan luar jer dah mahal imagine like five times a day five times a week you have to do that walao like it's a lot of money you know
correct like all the small small things ah like I think you spend less lah when you're working from home and like we're staying home more often you really just spend on like the essential items like groceries and like you know just the things that you really need I mean clothes also you want to buy nak pergi shopping nak beli apa seh
electricity bill lah bill air bill api
mm mm betul
mm ya a lot of a lot of emphasis is on work life balance nowadays ah I mean you tengok ah kalau
whatever lah like macam you are
kelakar right it's really like three hundred and sixty degrees eh completely different like but the I guess now people just have to accept what is the new normal lah you know what I mean
kalau tidak susah macam mana seh macam like if people still keep thinking that things will go back to normal like think about travelling like travelling is like
every every singaporean loves you know mm mm like that day apa tu baru national day weekend like most of the time like thousands of flights will go and that day somebody uploaded online like I think only seven flights went off during that long national day weekend
tu lah
mm mm betul nak fourteen fourteen days leceh lah nak pakai mask lah pakai ni lah and then I don't know like the amount of money that you're spending is not worth it lah
virtual workout virtual makeup I think that day I baru nampak virtual makeup session then like
like I feel like companies are really stepping out of their comfort zone to like provide virtual stuff for people in general you know so I think it's quite impressive like that day baru I was watching a play online like can you imagine like instead of going to the theatre you can actually watch it at home and the best part is it's for free interesting right
mm mm betul betul lah netflix eh netflix hari-hari
ya lah tapi the amount of things on netflix you can watch is
homerun even like malay shows I think what bunga tanjung or something like that that they have so it's quite interesting and it's like they have diverse range lah like malay english they even have like tamil shows and all that it's quite interesting like I mean I guess
I think dah buka lah but like I mean you have to take precaution right
you know going out is still a bit of a like you know you just go out like you say lah just go out for awhile then balik cepat-cepat you know what I mean so ya video calling is the new
neighborhood right ya correct correct even the fireworks seh oh my god that was so amazing like I didn't know that you cannot you I always thought that oh the fireworks you have to do at padang because that's the designated spot or like that's the legal legally allowed place but this year oh my god so many different places kat tampines ada kat jurong I think is it
once every four years right mm mm millions of dollars also the amount of money imagine all the duit
mm ya ya lah betul lah
boleh nyanyi mm
sure everyone around the world feels that way you know what I mean like you rasa like macam-macam lah you rasa marah lah you rasa sedih lah you rasa ni lah macam-macam
macam-macam perasaan tapi at the end of the day mesti positive lah you know kalau tak positive susah seh I mean hari-hari takkan I mean the thing is that
cannot be everyday you are positive lah of course some days kalau nak sedih ke nak marah ke just feel all your emotions and then
tak penat ke eh mm mm mm mm
betul no lah and also you complain
mm mm betul mm mm
ah ni kalau ni singaporean kalau tak complain bukan singaporean kan
mm mm betul I mean there's good and bad lah I mean like you said like
you complain and I don't know macam
mm betul
ya but also like I guess the other annoying thing or like the the recurring issue that is always being talked about is wearing of the mask lah right I mean ya I mean singapore nak semua orang kena pakai mask
tak payah pakai mask
so like macam suka-suka jer then I like
eh boleh ah I thought this wearing of mask thing it should be like mandatory lah for all but then I guess
jaga diri baik-baik lah you know kalau pakai nak pakai up to you lah you know
semua nak jadi famous ah semua tak ada kerja nak jadi famous ah so okay lah so dia orang tak nak pakai mask then like I guess
tu lah
bukannya mahal ke the mask ada I think what less than one dollar you can get already
uh tu lah
nak buat apa five year aku tak tahu aku cakap macam oh definitely I want to excel in my career meaning that I wanna be moving up the ladder not just in terms of management role lah but you know like also like macam okay if this is something that I have never done before so that to me is also a progression right or if let's say
I was like apa seh nak cakap
I aspire to inspire kau nampak kau nampak
yes so ah I had like three interviews and then um so this is what for it's like so as in I got three interviews err no was it three I think I I had three interviews and two follow up post yes yes yes from the same company so um I felt that macam this company is kan and and
I I wouldn't say informal it's it's formal enough to know err where you stand or what you want to get to know you as as as a candidate but at the same time it's not like stressful you you know how interview can be can become like macam like siala I want go interview but I scared sia yes like you know you get so intimidated by the interviewer
we choose it in a in a sense where this pandemic is gonna be for quite some time so even if you find a replacement job you must you be able to like the job if not you gonna drag your feet to work you know and you also have to think strategically in a way where macam um aku kerja sini kalau aku tak suka aku nak nak berhenti kerja lain then bila aku cari kerja lain I'm fighting with a lot more competition then after that macam
very much so yes okay lah no look my training ground is actually quite far tapi aku aku fikir panjang kan dia cakap five year plan kan aku fikir five plan dia dekat dengan rumah aku saya pun okay
yes my new colleague tell me okay okay we will see you become like reach this position in five years I just no lah no lah no lah satu tahun then coming july dua tahun
cepat juga kan I feel like macam wah all the job demands macam I'm like just taking in everything so it's good that you when this new colleague masuk kan beberapa macam
berlega sikit lah hati aku tak payah banyak sangat buat macam everything is on me you know and some more yes but when he ask me like oh like you want to become a we have a senior position at my workplace in the next few years I'm not sure you know having the having my own local brand
but I really wanted that tengah estate house get the the sales of balance flats if I get it the house will be ready in may twenty twenty two twenty twenty three because it was the first few launch yes the one that they released in november as in recently the house will only be ready in twenty twenty four or twenty twenty five jauh seh
because my fiance dia tak ada passion nak pergi sangat to get a house planning or let's say we'll see how
not not like what's in it for you but more of macam
uh role in terms of career wise I'm like in redeem kan so I used to be in right and then now I'm in like mass production retail so people it's funny macam we see that aspect of people who like I don't want to buy ah you know I want to save money ah now now tough time lah cannot spend lah
and and we haven't had a lot of okay lately there have been a few chinese tourists tourists bukan bukan local aku takut
boleh bah certain certain countries can come in singapore already what
so macam like a the same thing lah okay yes I I hear the same thing you know like now cannot lah no cannot spend lah now err must save money you know market very bad financial very bad blah blah blah blah blah but your bill can go up to like what five six hundred dollars
average family probably would have one lah fashion jenama big brand it's like that two iconic brand lah orang queue lah kat luar uh uh okay you know and chanel
orang people queue lah sia kat luar people queue people queue outside and these are some of the people who queues outside their store come up to my stores with paper bags of their stores and come to my store asking me eh got discount walao eh you buy eh you buy chanel then come to my store and then ask me for discount

dulu what
dulu kita tengok drama together what because there is timing for it what
kan aku pun selalu tengok suratkhabar just to tengok apa show yang ada for the day
and bila nak buka and bila tak payah buka at all
aku tengok that this one facebook post I think aku pun lupa bila
like that's when dia orang tahu that perempuan is actually lelaki they went for
they went for service punya
ya I mean in singapore it's called other countries I don't know but for service ni
seriously dia orang semua like most of the guys seriously they really look like a freaking girl
aku seriously seh
macam dah pernah eh
I mean mostly of my friends who have tunang
siapa boleh kasi aku attention wise
aku faham aku faham tapi kaucara kau cakap is like
because it's very different it's very different bila kau tengok eh everything it's all scripted what
that's why it relieves your stress level bila kau tengok cerita tu
cam kau get excited
so ada so ada voting punya ni lah
tak semua I watch bondi rescue
kau tau eh aku tengok that bondi rescue thirteen season it's to the point that aku cakap ngan mak aku nak jadi lifeguard
uh bondi rescue is like mm kau lifeguard so basically you just jaga this beach kau
no they are just on their job basis so basically this cameramen just come in just shooting their everyday punya
no but you know it's very how to say ah macam
macam dia puaskan hati kau tau yang bila diorang actually
inspire me ya something like that because aku tengok kan this one season kan they diorang fail to apa tu uh save this couple tau old couple
they are in their seventies kalau tak salah aku they only managed to save
dia ada tiga orang this couple dengan lagi satu diorang punya kirakan in-laws lah
kirakan adik ipar is it aku pun tak sure
ah betul lah abang ipar lah tu
melayu fail
so basically diorang bila diorang dah save this tiga orang kan no diorang save satu aje dahulu because lifeguards kat situ empat orang in duty
three of them just go there and save kalau ada orang drown lagi how
diorang nangis actually because they couldn't save
diorang rasa macam diorang salah diorang punya salah sebab tu kan
aku nangis because aku tengok diorang actually trying to revive that that couple back
really diorang really like went all out
betul ah
that's why they cry because they try so hard tapi they try to actually macam cover themself up ah because diorang tahu kan diorang being
tapi banyak orang like surrounding diorang macam like kind of like macam blaming them for not doing their job properly macam couldn't rescue them on time
kau imagine eh kerja kau as a lifeguard kau ada empat like only four of you and you expect them to rescue all of you who are drowing which is to me pada aku is just so sad
oh kesian kan
kan that's why aku I wanted to be at that one point of time ah because aku really aku admire diorang punya how to say ah macam diorang punya semangat untuk kerja
kau tahu eh after that that three lifeguard eh two lifeguard took a long leave because they were was ah because they were affected by that thingy
abeh ada satu lagi that one episode before diorang habis tu season
yang satu budak ni actually dia carik bapa dia tau for three hours kat beach tu beach tu memang besar gila ah
dia ada north south
ah K basically K you get the point lah eh dia punya laut besar
dia cari bapa dia tiga jam pastu last dia pergi that tower where all the lifeguard is there dia cakap uh apa aku tengah cari bapa aku boleh tak buat announcement
yang kau tahu yang this one lifeguard actually cakap yang tadi aku try save this one old lady
aku try to save this one guy but then by the time aku sampai kepala dia dah takde
ya he wasn't sure at all itu orang ke batu
tak save because dia tak tak boleh cari
because diorang save is pakai board tau
pakai diorang diorang sendiri swim
surfing surfing board tu diorang sendiri pergi
K lah after that bila budak tu patah balik eh diorang punya mindset is all the lifeguard kalau selagi takde datang kat sini cari orang kirakan itu is batu bukan orang it's a good thing
dia tak move then after that bila budak tu datang dia cakap aku dah cari bapa aku dah tiga jam
semua orang got called out because they had to do a search in that laut
they they went there for holiday but then it ended up and the saddest thing is kau tahu on that day he died it was his birthday
aku nangis aku seriously mak dia dah pengsan anak dia dah kirakan nak jadi the strong pillar for the mother
he just stand there ah just wait for someone to actually bawak body dia masuk
aku emotional lah
itu dah lama seh
eh but diorang punya joke is very far how to say eh it's very
kau nak kene really like tangkap that to to actually understand
it's kelakar pada aku kelakar gila no okay dia punya joke is very
kau nak kene really understand
what if you watch properly you will understand that diorang punya joke is really mendalam
cam it's just inside joke
kalau if you get it you laugh if you don't get it you dont laugh you know that kind of shit
pada aku lah it's fun lah

ya one of my nicest friend I have aku tak banyak kawan actually
actually kita orang semua sama lah
sofian aja banyak kawan aku rasa sofian banyak kawan
ya dia extrovert aku aku ngan kau aku rasa very introvert
tapi diorang main-main jer kan
kau serious ah you are the oldest
naik basikal I see the cuaca today like hot only
I need to wear face masks right now sekarang dengan COVID nineteen ni semua
oh the kain yang macam instructor when they do instructors when they do camp they wear that buff mask right that kind that oh ya okay okay
tadi that time you told me before lah apa you cakap you you cycling abeh ada benda go into your mouth is it
susah nak nak bernafas lah ni
lalat as in ah as in lalat as in housefly
but a lalat the black flying buzzing thing
you swallowed you went to swallow ah the housefly sedap tak
so you were cakap orang cakap apa ni perfectly fine ah after you accidentally swallowed a housefly
the oh ya true true ada tempat yang
err ya I mean ada tempat
entah mana lah suka they they love to makan all these maggots spiders all these weird weird apa binatang ni semua
no no I I don't I don't want to eat all these any weird animals eh you said you you ride bicycle eh datang sini
and you tengah ambil your motorbike licence right are you oh yes
kat mana where you take where you taking ah
and kalau you naik motorbike if I'm not wrong lah if I'm not wrong err if you work under foodpanda dia punya gaji lebih kan sepuluh dollar per hour I think
tapi I think I got some friends who are under
who are under foodpanda dia orang I ada tanya lah I ask them eh how much gaji bagus tak if you work with foodpanda as part time and stuff and they say it it's not bad lah actually like I think they have the for foodpanda if I'm not wrong they have the
hourly rate and then if within that one hour you boleh hantar banyak makanan they call it docket if I'm not wrong
so if you can hantar more food means you earn more dockets and there's ada macam bonus lah kasih dia orang happy sikit kasih the riders happy sikit
macam competing lah
oh okay tapi if I'm not around kan ah kadang-kadang if the customer happy you bawa
their their makanan cepat-cepat then they will boleh kasih you tip eh
tapi tengok lah tapi ada orang kasih ke tak
okay okay okay tapi ah what's the
what's the paling banyak ah orang kasih your tip
macam paling banyak tip one time they give you one big tip ada tak
one customer kasih give you ah ten dollar tip
wah very good ah but oh ya your bicycle I see I like so terkejut no I follow my friends semua nak beli basikal I thought lah I ingat one bicycle maybe
sixty dollars ke hundred dollars ke but
and we can you imagine you tengah hantar makanan orang tengah tunggu at the house waiting where is my food alamak then find out the the rider bicycle pancit or the wheel
ah pecah ke apa then like quite wasted lah if you buy a cheap very cheap kind of bicycle
oh ya lah dia punya drivers kalau nampak orang bicycle they will try to try to apa tu drive very near to the bicycle ya lah I mean I know that you all want to rush for more orders means more money but then sometimes terlupa that eh you guys are on the road
and there are buses ada apa tu lorry ada motorcycles semua so next time just be more careful lah tengok lah before you pusing you tengok apa apa tu blind spot check back check back eh check back whether there any vehicles around you ah
okay okay then you tadi morning you told me you were taking your motorbike practical also right kat where again kat mana the ubi ubi eunos there right is it
ah so you macam tahu lah apa dia punya dangers and stuff
so next time when you dah dapat license your motorbike licence ke car license or lorry license so next time you know especially when you see eh got one cyclist coming or eh got one cyclists behind me you know lah to be more careful
eh wait wait that means you on which practical five eh lima
ah okay okay okay before oh ya prac five yang you have to do everything in the circuit then kalau pass prac six then only can go out at the road
uh okay tapi one thing about ubi eh cause I took my license there at ubi also
that dulu lah dulu lah when I when I took my license apa tu ubi ah very crowded so you just be very careful lah kalau especially when you first time keluar naik road
because I know some of my kawan they took the license motorbike licence kat
the one yang kat the one yang kat mana woodlands woodlands ya I know they told me that the area there sunyi ah quiet like not as many vehicles not as crowded macam kat ubi so I think for them was macam lagi senang to pass the test lah test
you naik basikal to ubi
oh you tak ambil public transport
orh okay okay okay then for you kalau dari hougang want to cycle to woodlands itu dah penat bro
by the time you want to start your lesson at woodlands you already penat you cannot really ride the motorbike motorbike ride you I think I don't know whether motorbike would go then later you kena scolding from all instructors
tapi I think one practical how much is it now
dua puluh eh dua puluh lebih
oh yes yes as you I think as you naik naik uh as you progress the cost of course lah dah lagi more mahal
kalau you go out on the road I think one instructor the ratio one instructor is to five
six or five riders I think that that's lagi more mahal lah as you go along this
but when do you think you will get your license though boleh beli motorbike boleh naik motorbike no need to ride your bicycle
lagi that day yang kat ah news north west line the major ah blackout alamak itu dia orang during bila peak period and then the red line the green line dengan dia punya yellow line sekali breakdown
ya but ah apa tu when you when you dah pass eh which I hope you do pass soon which motorbike you looking for yamaha suzuki
one five zero itu kan the tuning training centre punya motorbike eh tak
oh you can get cause I know my friends yang sekarang tengah pakai they say it's err fuel efficient dapat jimat duit sikit
atau kalau you banyak duit sangat kan you boleh beli those err more expensive motorbike yang macam triumph
triumph or ah the one I paling suka when I see people riding on the motorbike uh royal enfield
oh but you don't want to buy a first hand punya motorbike eh
wah and then kalau you tak ada here for six months then who going to use your bike cause you need to always someone needs to start start your motorbike right you cannot leave it err sleeping for too long period
but I mean the transport transports sekarang tak boleh reliable sangat lah sekarang
tapi I would say that the transport has he has been getting better lah dulu I think a few years back three or four years back ada this one period of time macam every week confirm plus chop ada breakdown every week confirm ada
breakdown lah ada yang
the travelling time was too long ada jer problem kadang-kadang but I would say now is much better lah they're doing a much better job but but having said that masih boleh improve that they can still improve so that's my take
the best surprise eh yang I paling dapat uh
ini many years ago lah eh many many years ago when a for my twenty first birthday selamat hari jadi eh my twenty first birthday ah my kawan-kawan kaki bola my soccer mates want to throw me a birthday
ya so I remember that time masih masih bulan ramadan that time when we were still fasting and then my birthday fell within that month lah
then err they chose this place namanya is called mark's place the one at eunos they wanted to belanja me dinner then okay I was like okay sure ah then I went down
they book the table for seven so senang lah bila time buka we all boleh makan together right
so I came down I was so excited lah kirakan eh I went there at about pukul berapa eh I went six thirty so I sat there and I was the first to come I was the first to arrive so okay I duduk I duduk there at the table
then I duduk I tunggu tunggu tunggu for my friends nobody turn up tak ada orang datang
so I just wait and wait and wait and then the next thing I know ada because the place where I tengah duduk uh is facing the road
so I saw this one kereta just drive past tapi nampak ni kereta macam pernah nampak jer this kereta then I noticed dia punya driver was my one of my teammates so I was like okay okay maybe they already arrived so I'll just continue sitting down so
oh by the way kita tak makan kat sini I tengok them they tengok me and then I still remember other tables
they went to put a blindfold around me and then I was like terkejut sikit lah eh asal tiba-tiba want to blindfold me right so they blindfold me and then they they put me in the car
then err so they blindfolded me so when I masuk the kereta I didn't know who is inside I don't know what was inside the car so you just tell me diam-diam and then just sit in the car they will drive me to a unknown location lah location yang I sendiri tak tahu so
but then I think the duration on the car trip was about twenty minutes I could hear like they went to make some pit stops because I can hear the the dia punya pintu
I can hear the pintu buka but when the pintu buka also I I cannot remove my blindfold okay then after that I
I felt like the car dah park and then my kawan-kawan say okay now you can uh get off the car so of course ada orang pimpin my tangan cause I already blindfolded I cannot just walk right I might fall into longkang or something
ah okay then I just ikut I just pimpin my friend tangan they brought me to a unknown location ah next thing I know when I open my blindfold I was at marina barrage heated gang marina barrage
kita kat marina barrage
ya oh if I remember correctly tak salah there were about
seven to eight more of my soccer teammates who were there and they they were sweet they letak uh picnic mat they letak uh fairy lights and they prepared some makanan like pizza which was good because I was hungry by then and
just to remind everyone that we were err tengah puasa time tengah puasa I was very hungry and then they prepared some food and drinks ada bawa uh game cards so that we could play and then we played some music and nice lah like people celebrate your twenty first birthday
yang paling best uh lepas kita dah makan dah sing song uh perut dah kenyang and then err one of them pass me a birthday present
and nasib is the birthday present that I have been wanting for quite some time it was a kasut nike like this specific kasut yang
was quite mahal lah actually so they managed to everybody chip in some money and then they bought this kasut that I think was about dua ratus lebih this pair of nike shoes
and honestly when if I were to buy a present for somebody I will tanya the person first like oh apa yang you nak you want a teddy bear ke you want
you want if motorbike cannot lah I not that kaya so I cannot buy for you a motorbike but if you want a storybook or a backpack boleh lah if you your birthday present what do you want
ya at that point in time bila aku dalam kereta macam eh
takkan they want to kidnap me takkan they want to hantar me to johor bahru or put me in a abandoned house or something ada lah there was a period of time I was like asal kereta ni macam suddenly so quiet eh like where is everybody in the car or suddenly they abandoned the car then I'm sitting there alone in the car not knowing what's happening
so but I trusted them I mean they are my apa ke tu ah kawan-kawan kaki bola so that ended well and I think the thing about a presents eh
because sometimes I don't want to belikan orang tu a present that they might not want or atau present like they won't use so either I will ask them personally like oh okay what do you want for your birthday lah or it's either I buy for them uh
vouchers like it can be macam adidas voucher it can be capitaland mall vouchers can be nike vouchers ah pergilah kau apa kau nak beli
I know kalau kalau perempuan dia orang selalu cakap lagi senang pasal can buy err gift card from sephora especially like sephora or you can buy from victoria secrets usually lah girls I think lagi senang to to buy presents for compared to a guy
took my suggestions I I wouldn't even call it suggestions actually I said that I tak suka kalau macam
uh big uh birthday bash macam ada orang kan they especially kalau
twenty one birthday they will have their macam nak glamour glamour have it at the chalet where they where they will invite macam kawan dia nenek dia cousin dia abeh nanti banyak sangat orang like I tak suka that kind of stuff lah
kawan-kawan rapat lah so is good thing that they didn't throw a big uh big surprise at a chalet or hotel so I do you like kalau anybody do like a big grand gesture like that
and also kalau macam banyak sangat orang especially kalau invite banyak sangat orang abeh orang yang you tak kenal atau orang yang that you barely talk to so you macam tak nak awkward lah then kalau banyak sangat orang also later you have to
you have to split your time with err different people and then I mean you cannot cut yourself into half right so you will have to speak with this group of people for like five ten minutes and then you kena go to entertain another group then you you'll be busy just entertain people actually
instead of having macam a very good time and macam shiok sendiri
and I so I feel like kalau like you want to have a this macam grand gestures right you need to kena fikir where you want to have your your birthday present where sorry where you want to have your birthday celebration until macam sakit kepala lah you have to think
about venue and then you have to book in advance kalau you want to do like
tempat mahal-mahal macam hotel you have to book maybe a few months in advance
maybe and aside from venue also you kena book
ah makanan I mean come on I mean when you invite people you don't want them to come there and then there's like nothing to eat anyway we're all singaporeans right so we we love our food so we need think about venue nak kena fikir pasal uh makanan
and then you have to send out invitation then you have to you if you want to have some entertainment then you have to fikir oh what entertainment do you want I mean kalau you have someone else who is doing the planning and stuff okay lah then you can like lepak don't have to
if you gonna dapat orang birthday planner or something like that then you kena bayar this birthday planner pakai duit lagi
oh ya I mean like quite true eh tadi you cakap pasal if your birthday on macam twenty fifth december ke or macam your birthday is on err
thirty first december where's the peak period macam banyak orang confirm nak nak book err tempat macam want to book the hotels dekat dekat dengan the floating platform so they can probably see like the fireworks and stuff
so that one will be even harder lah I would say or even if your birthday falls uh during national day parade I'm pretty sure it will be quite difficult quite difficult and susah to dapat all this uh bookings and stuff
and also kalau macam some people macam tak nak celebrate dia punya birthday kat singapore nak pergi overseas ke apa nak pergi batam
or let's say somewhere even further like you want to go poland or something to go and celebrate your birthday itu lagi mahal kau nak kena beli apa tu plane tickets semua tapi sekarang bila time macam gini
nobody saw it coming macam time COVID you cannot go anywhere man you have to stay in singapore you have to celebrate your birthday in singapore but of course it will be more gerek lah if you can celebrate your birthday in bali or something watching the sunset or sunrise that one confirm more gerek sia
like I think for me kalau if I can choose eh where I want to spend my birthday I want to go where's that tempat banyak sheeps ah new zealand
like honestly if I can if I can choose a place to celebrate my birthday or to choose a tempat for me to go holiday that would definitely been using you can go to the countryside boleh apa tu feed the animals you can play with the animals I mean come on man in singapore
err kambing so at least when you go places like new zealand especially dia punya countryside you get to see all this kind of animals and you get to do a lot of uh
natural activities like apa tu yang kat river the water rafting you can go hiking you can see
uh nice nice mountains and of course dia punya cuaca also lain lain from singapore singapore is always hot either hot or wet so at least there in new zealand if you can go during the winter times dapat juga some snow you pernah pergi new zealand eh
tapi kalau uh japan japan nak cari
halal food also was quite difficult I remember that time when I went with my family we went to go japan or we wanted to look for halal food punya lah susah and
it was not readily available so you have to do your macam homework lah before you go you must probably want to bookmark the places where you want to makan halal food
because it's not like singapore where your halal food boleh dapat at food court you can dapat your halal food at a hawker centres which are all semua dekat dekat boleh jalan so there the
their are halal food ah is different different locations and you have to go and find it in orang jepun they don't really speak english so kalau nak berbual you probably have to use ah the app google translate to help you out
oh the place I went mana eh I went to their
uh tokyo so tokyo was tokyo honestly dia macam singapore lah macam banyak sangat orang it's very crowded it's a very urbanized so if there's other parts of jepun that I would like to visit err I will go further up north
err pergi hokkaido I think hokkaido also lagi tempat dia will be more sejuk and I think the food will be even nicer as well
have to been to pernah pergi tak hokkaido
so I think kalau if you don't want to go jepun another place that I pernah pergi also err south korea like at least south korea you know lah people there dia punya complexion semua cantik-cantik
semua the people there their are complexion all putih-putih and then I think probably I know why now because when I went there their food
is always some kind of err herbal food dia punya makanan is very different from singapore like our singapore diet kita banyak lemak-lemak kita banyak pakai err makanan yang very oily but there in korea their food
and they always like to eat their favorite kimchi so I think their diet really helps them out to for them to look even more kacak and cantik lah actually
oh ya because their their location have err what you call that four seasons but for us in singapore it's just hot all year round because we are located dekat equator
so I mean I'm pretty sure uh countries yang ada four seasons of course their complexion would be even better I mean if you go to ah further up north
places macam err sweden ke or you go to norway or finland if you tengok their completion putih macam letak bedak kind of putih
and err one thing kalau want to talk about uh going on vacation and stuff I think one err important aspect about going to vacation is to naik kapal terbang like honestly I miss
I miss taking all this kapal terbang just to duduk inside the plane and then below you look out the window you can see the clouds you among the clouds and that
in a roller coaster when the plane dah nak takeoff atau the plane about to land I think that's why now COVID err introduce the
dining in the parked aeroplane like macam banyak orang nak pergi tapi dia punya pricing I would say to me is a bit expensive like you are eating
I think the cheapest one for the economy class is two hundred two hundred dollar plus just to be eating in a parked plane and sitting in the tempat economy
so maybe I will decide nak tengok nak pergi ke tak but probably not maybe you just want to sit the aeroplane and that's probably the closest thing lah that you can get to travelling during this
err COVID situation will you go for this err parked err makan
and also I think the the tickets for the business class and first class if I'm not wrong lah is about six hundred plus if I'm not wrong and honestly kalau nak fikir pasal six hundred plus I think that six hundred plus I can use
for better purposes six hundred plus I can use it for a staycation kat sentosa ke or I can use that money for
I can use that for better purpose as an anyway since we are coming to december dah nak dekat
I would wait for the hundred dollars tourism voucher lah to use it and spend and help to revive the economy because I mean since orang kat luar cannot come in so obviously we are the ones who have to
next week kau start ni kan apa ah volunteer eh
kat mana ni kau pergi where is it
orientation online macam mana what like what a lot of you meet macam gitu
ya lah this kind of volunteering betul betul betul betul betul I'm sure you can find something that you can do best you know macam that will fit you punya
chinese new year I think uh end jan apa
selalunya selalunya kan end jan
entah copywriting ya exactly maybe they should they will definitely make you guys to macam go on the ground isn't it macam distribute stuff no ah kau tak penat ke but they might ask you to do that no like be on the ground
penat ke apa engkau ke you know like you got to
how the hell would I know abeh macam you have to go on the ground like what if they ask you to like okay you go to the homes and distribute stuff
ya they volunteer because I'm I'm one of the uh volunteers right so aku my my my volunteering with them is really fostering ah so I'm a rather than you know uh
it's a shelter the dogs are in kan kan is a shelter it's over at west we're actually quite close to what tengah ya tengah ya we are very close it's it's just next to choa chu kang ya like we're very close to so they have people they have volunteers at the shelter itself so that means the volunteers must go to the shelter uh that involves dog walking
err cleaning really literally like cleaning the you know the poo poo ya ya and then uh there are volunteers such as ambassadors such as what I mean like macam they have events they have events like okay then there is an event here at this uh uh at this uh area at one raffles place so they have like a booth or two booths you know and then they need somebody to to to to to man the merchandise table and another one is to macam
uh macam orang lalu-lalang kan then you macam talk about the awareness gitu lah which I wouldn't mind doing actually uh tapi sekarang uh we don't get enough as a volunteer I don't get the notifications anymore because I think they stopped that lah for being like you said lah because of the COVID ya so they're not so you know they can't go out in the open anymore for now
dog walker boleh lah cuma only you and the dogs tapi macam public all this awareness sort of stuff uh no not so much now I think later they will probably do it I used to get uh emails pasal unit unit ambassadors and all that tapi now no more
ambassadors macam you you you macam you at the booth and you wear punya t-shirt uh you're next to the merchandise punya table sell the merchandise and then of course the donations punya uh apa ni uh tin tu kan and then then you talk to people about okay this is what we do uh this is what we do as an and these are the cases macam gitu awareness of uh what does and how they can help oh they also have social uh pre-corporate social responsibility punya programs companies punya tu
so then you can do that uh they can say oh we need we need volunteers for to do the ambassador part and all that ya so of course they have different volunteer ada volunteer macam photography
macam to be a volunteer photographer to take pictures of their animals for their adoption drive for their website ya you know all the gambar-gambar for the calendars so regular they need uh you know volunteers photography web design web designer of course fosterers a lot lah I'm one of them
which I'm fostering for kucing I volunteer to be a foster for critical care
fosterer for puppies macam gitu so when they have cases then they contact you say okay wati we have this then
exactly kesian kan
you know lah kan international kan kan nama international punya brand kan so orang pun ada lah you know macam kasih donation gitu ada lah I think I guess they do have you know uh
uh but at the end of the day they still run on donations only which is quite sad uh kita punya G O V takde kasih apa-apa
dia orang eh ini binatang-binatang kita orang tau daripada negeri ini mesti lah jaga sikit
ah that is the masalahnya tu
oh I think must there has to be some uh apa ni uh macam caretaking of all or all inhabitants but of course we're certainly the portion is not lah macam of course the priority is to be citizens in a way as in proportionate you know but
areas not all these wooded areas you know these these areas bukit batok lah banyak banyak macam jungle jungle apa they are clearing all the forests and the stray dogs are coming out you don't know bukit batok has a lot of stray dogs ya and they are the stray dogs are coming out from the jungle areas and where are they going to go they are being pushed out right from other developments where are they going to go then they are going into the uh estates like now so then of course who is going to get panicky residents residents are going to complain uh authorities come in take the dogs and cull them which is very inhumane so ideally what you should happen is if you are going to develop the land which I know you probably should have to but then there has to be contingency plan where you going to drive the animals out  you know is like I feel it is not thought through out you know okay we're going to develop the land we're going to end up pushing the animals that are in there they are going to end up going to hello resident areas so why don't we do something about that two pronged approach
tengah mm mm mm
of course they know they know they see it we they see it all the time and dogs are coming out punggol pasir ris choa chu kang but there also but also yes the wild boar of course is in the news and everything how can they not know but are they doing anything no they are not the second part is the second part is they are not this is why we are frustrated we go like why don't you do something help we are not telling you to do it one hundred percent because we are completely we understand that they are completely incompetent but takde collaboration kau faham tak takde supportive effort at all macam okay kau okay kita sekarang kita punya and animal welfare groups okay why don't we support you into doing this you know what I mean kita nak buat macam gitu macam okay kita dia orang because dia orang uh yang boleh ambil I mean they are the ones with the expertise the heart the passion all that but they cannot be run they they cannot do all because they have no space and duit takde duit kan so siapa yang ada duit ni yang itu kan government kan so at least macam okay kita tolong collaborate lah you know uh okay uh kita buat ni then you all can uh kita boleh kasih kau orang support sikit-sikit untuk blah blah blah you know this is exactly what should happen but it's not happening so apa yang buat sekarang is bila binatang ni keluar yang gahmen gahmen ni semua angkat tangkap bunuh it's like it's an inhumane approach you know what I mean ya itu yang kita boring
ya lah tapi not to this extent not to this extent look at tengah now tengah baru tengah is now being developed which means they are they are accelerating and intensifying the development so now the animals are getting pushed out last time the animals are not getting pushed out so much because tengah is still around correct lim chu kang sekarang semua nak development punggol mana ada punggol dulu dulu mana ada waterway punggol sekarang dah ada punggol apa all the dogs from punggol are coming out you can you can literally walk on punggol street with the traffic light and there's like a pack of stray dogs dulu mana ada because punggol was not developed that's why the the problem is highlighting is being highlighted now because wah dogs are coming out what how come people people are like how come there are so many dogs because they have been around but just that they have been developing they are getting pushed out they have the dogs have been around in there in the jungles people I know people who go around and feed the dogs at the edges of the forest because the dogs are coming out you know you they know why these people go to feed them at the edges is because they are trying to prevent the dogs from coming into estates because it will be that will spell danger for the dogs you know the dogs people are going to complain people are going to complain the the dogs are going to be in danger so but the dogs are hungry so people now the feeders go to the edges to feed them and the dogs are you know they are wild dogs they're feral dogs but they are very smart and they very and they really harmless because all they want is food they're not interested to go down to the to your heartlands and do what whatever you know they just want food so the people the feeders there go to the edges feed them then they go back inside the the jungles they are very sweet you know but
the wild boar pun sama
betul exactly aku nak salahkan wild boar tu macam mana kesian pula so this is exactly what we are ini macam frustration lah kan
no gatal kau tengok aku punya ni rashes tapi aku memang sensitive skin
kau kulit kulit buaya
kau takde macam ni cover ni kan ni kan
abeh ada tulis arab ah
kena saman there's no such thing
I don't know about the saman part I know you that you kena saman if you litter
we tell people don't put up food water because the dengue and then particularly doesn't like that because dengue apa
you know they because they have they have a certain route right okay block this block I feed three cats eat eat eat feed feed feed feed makan makan makan ah dah habis okay bye bye clear
and then I go to the next block some people do that or some feeders they will just from one block X they walk to they leave the food then they go to block Y Z then they balik then patah balik dia orang patah balik then clear lah
kalau tidak it is considered littering
entah littering lah whatever the charge is whatever the sum is hundred dollars I don't know
town councils town councils um cat welfare society ya ya usually cat welfare society collaborate with town council and they put a sign lah dekat kat lift landing you know uh please keep clear within two hours macam gitu macam posters
bagus lah
block mana this block this block
kesian kan
macam back to macam back to nature eh
scout does I thought dia bawa kawan dia
ni depan ni eh
kesian eh
away from all the orang-orang
ya eh masa
macam what bila aku dekat uh botanic gardens aku kerja kat situ oh my god the otters came all the time and they were huge my god they are like
oh they have a certain route all my colleagues will go off first at ten o'clock they will be here and then after that you can find them dia orang macam ada very designated they like know where to go first first then second twelve o'clock you will see them there is like
uh I guess because botanic gardens kan ada lakes kan ada lakes ada eco lake swan lake and all the macam the stream stream stream and you know botanic gardens
the the the park rangers make sure that the animals don't get disturbed you know so uh when there are otters we tell people me when I was located you know like me when I was located no please please stay aside you know make sure ya we basically monitored people's behaviours so uh the the we were policing the people for the otters the otters I guess felt safe macam ada bodyguard
ya dah macam they were protected ya which is a nice thing you know and but it's so nice to see them they were so cute huge though oh my god the biggest one I swear I swear it was like that I was like when I saw I was like my god it's huge ya they're very big
because singapore there are a few a few families of otters they're not no they're few families dia macam different clans
are you cray cray are you kidding me they are different ya there are different families macam different hello macam macam tigers kan lions kan ada different pride
sini ada so they have the kallang clan the kallang one which is like the the family that lives ya alah kau baca lah dalam surat khabar you know the otter city the otter the otters are being watched by their fan club
ya they are macam a'ah they macam the hobbies gitu
ah yes they are watching the birds the ah okay yes macam gitu
mana ya alah of course lah they look the same mana lah aku tahu macam mana rupa dia orang but they are these these people are the experts right they they like okay that belongs to the kallang clan
uh so the kallang clan otters are the ones that hang out in the kallang area dia macam territorial lah
maybe they are another clan but then again you know yang dekat yang dekat kallang tu wah I tell you
uh or the ones yang pergi kau tak baca dia masuk kat
ah gitu dengan tu that one is one clan know
ya eh dekat bishan park bishan park pun ada tau
you know macam they have a certain it's just like cats and dogs and lions and all that this is their roaming this is their range
uh this is their territory kau masuk dalam territory dia orang boleh bergaduh
dia orang bukan macam um some canines some felines yang after a while they have to separate you know so I don't think so that's why you call it a family great technique family
I think uh tempat fishing punya people who are not allowed to fish but they still fish there
I think kallang I think one of the anglers one of them the babies got stuck the hook mati tau so sad
they macam they go to their mana aku tahu dia orang pergi mana but they have their own spare trait lah kalau kau macam pergi dekat kallang river side I'm sure there is you can see them I told you botanic gardens they do botanic gardens
to be honest aku tak ingat sejak bila when is the first time they came out but otters ni tapi uh
uh both apa ni uh I don't know I don't know I don't remember when aku nak kencing I don't remember exactly when I don't remember exactly apa apasal aku toilet what do you mean I come back lah
ya cakap jer but I don't remember exactly when the otters um
uh I don't remember exactly when the otters you know keluar but definitely at least uh you know five years I think
bila bila aku start perasan ni lah when I first started you know noticed the news ah not noticed the orchards okay noticed the news
masa kampung babe masa kampung-kampung dulu kan ada sungai-sungai otters nak pergi nak buat apa sekarang they're all where are they going to go
sama lah sama lah
these people these okay these animals are native so when they started ya ya they are native they are you know also they're from we have mangrove apa dekat sungei buloh tu kan so I guess they decided to jalan keluar jauh sikit lor
not care taking not care taking no no ya ya ya ya ya ya they are not it's not care taking but they care for them in the sense that they care for their welfare they will do uh they will do um macam awareness macam don't feed the otters do not go near them don't
you know if you see them stay away don't don't provoke don't apa apa you know so they do that sort of message they carry that sort of message but of course depending on the context lah these are otters so you know so when they say we say they care for them means they will like they know oh they come out at this time so they know their habits they know how many of them
you know they might even have names I don't know ya so there's this group uh this you know quite a sizable number of their fan club that actually know them that knows them well well enough to know that this one belongs to this and there are like seven adults and two babies meh ya you know from a distance I guess they record which is kau tahu macam
macam macam the ornithologist yang tengok-tengok observe the birds and they will also all these these clans but they don't necessarily take care of them right in that sense
you know the otters in the city wow can you imagine you are at bloody then otters that's like wow what a nice sight of course of course ya ya ya but you know ya because they are like macam unlikely sight
ya mana ya pythons ya pythons and then they ate the cats and all that ya there's one there's one recently uh couple of two months ago maybe one snake over at entah bukit merah or what the snake ate the cat the com cat
ya all these com cats kat bawah it's the natural predator apa natural hello this is a cats snake hungry ya so they ate been a few cases where the cats ate the snakes is it com cat
less and less what forest yes yes exactly so we are driving them out so the snakes are eating the com cats already quite a few com cats already mati because of these the snake pernah ada satu ada satu gambar ada satu gambar yang snake tu yang snake tu tengah com cat dekat depan dekat mak news ah snake com cat ah
okay so err tadi kan kita cakap pasal three wish tadi kita cakap pasal the three wishes kan for the year so you said that you already have one of the wishes fulfilled what's the other two that you think we should try to accomplish as a family or like individual
your youtube punya channel do you have a target like for the number of followers
because macam I thought like your the intention of the game right was to show highlights lah but if you don't have those kind macam those text yang dekat tepi tu say like to narrate whatever that the screen is doing because most of the people who watch the video dia orang tak on the audio what kau kalau macam the person switch off the audio and you just you playing macam tak ada some err text visuals to compliment you punya video so I thought like I don't know maybe it could be your first draft jer
oh okay I faham so that means dia punya the video that you are trying to achieve or your channel kan it's like macam highlights for that particular night punya game like what other wins and what are the near wins what are the losses lah that kind of that's that's the kind of like video channel that you trying to achieve lah
so I I I'm just thinking right is like it gives me that kind of macam those err it gives me that kind of impression macam when I watch people play game kan it's like it's as though like they are narrating something or like or what are they trying to achieve through this video macam it's just it's similar just like the makan punya channel or makan punya video it's like okay here's what I ordered for lunch today okay let's see whether it's
going to be delicious mm ya is very nice ya I like the prawn is a bit juicy you know but it's not something that your audience boleh visualise or taste or what you know so I I you is it something like that that kind of err are you targeting that kind of audience where people just watch it just for the sake of watching it but there's no there's really no purpose you just like to share that like
we were talking about a one one wish that you said that you already achieve right the five which you already got through the um your spidey spider suit right then then the one that someone was wearing is apa tu the spiderman the puffy one that's the one that your brother give
so I'm thinking if we could get a family one but I am obviously cannot wear it outside because it's haram because it's very very very ketat unless I wear it for swimming
because properly they cover all my aurat so I I mean macam if you see that is a good investment for us to like all the school shoes it's kind of different kind of combination then we can right
then ya we just take the measurement ah tapi yang the one you beli tu berapa ah
black cat apa cat woman what the shouldn't he just be a cat woman but it's leather kan cat woman punya
cat woman punya okay ah ada cat woman punya I nak ah
oh ya you dah telefon your mother to come tomorrow
no wah you tahu my colleague geraldine she encash fourteen days eh oh my god I was like
how did everyone accumulate two digit punya leave balance seh
ya no but for me is I think the work from home thing save me a bit because at least I can manage my time kalau tak already I tell you by august begitu kan I would already have exhausted all my leave already for safwan appointment the children vaccination and then you know remember saffi hospitalise
ya I guess that's the only one ah oh ya tadi kita cakap pasal what can you mentioned the IKEA punya cannot cannot fit are you sure like all the cabinets cannot fit
whether right we should just err err fix the cabinet dekat err the master bedroom side because um for this mean toilet I nak ada other some improvements in err in terms like macam there's that rail handrail so that down the road kan kita tak payah nak renovate
ya because adding the macam cabinet there kan it might like macam block orang punya as in it might block lah whoever who
wait the toilet renovations two toilet renovation ten K or just the jamban
then oh right that was not your right the one that err rumah dia is actually just opposite B P there right the resale kan actually no wonder they need to err hack the toilet because she um megan got tell me before the dia punya rumah tu macam quite rundown and then if they don't fix it kan macam is cannot as in there will be leak and everything lah
huh ya ke that means they just enter the house don't need to do anything
oh then who was the one who told me that they need to fix the piping and everything ya ke izzad punya rumah dekat mana
oh they take over they are not err apa tu getting a new house ah because I know the dia orang punya cousin wardah and umar kan nearby kan that's why they don't intend to shift ah
so bila ija bersalin
oh man tapi they they always give a one week one week
tak baik seh cakap macam tu
I think I think dia pun worried seh
eh tapi dah tahu lelaki atau perempuan
orh what tanya jer ah what the heck
I don't know actually right if I were to go through one more time ah the pregnancy ah I really want to have that element of surprise lah it's okay I'm just gonna push him up or push her out and then know the gender but it's hard because I need to prepare and I'm not someone who will tak boleh tak boleh like not prepare
it cannot that and then I know for me kan I can't although it's a good surprise right if it doesn't macam if I'm not wrong planning need or what right macam it won't impact me for example like is my kid so I know that I need to make preparation for it what cause like my kid keluar I need to macam make sure oh dia punya the bottle is blue for example and it's not in pink you know that kind so to me I mean we can buy neutral colours lah it's just that I don't know ah macam
macam ah very not that the bottles that I bought have to be blue is in green kan actually the bottle yang I belikan tu all green kan because ah safwan punya milk pun green dia punya apparel pun green ingat tak and then dia punya yang all the friends yang kita beli ni semua
colour hitam so it's like there's no gender coloured gender influence colour
ya but actually I kind of like the pink pink blue kind of combination macam those kind of paddle pop punya colour like you know very pastel kind is it pastel
yang dia rainbow tau yang paddle pop punya ice cream tu tau
actually I kind of actually I wanted the this room to be like that see like this blue kan kan it goes well with this kind of pink kan cantik kan
wah okay lah actually there are a lot of things that I want to improve for this house actually the very first thing right I want to do is actually kan I nak amend and fix the dapur punya counter top I really cannot stand the counter top lah ya macam so hard to clean it's like I think it's because of the the macam the gap
ya and then the thing is right the water the water doesn't dry out as fast as I want it to be I don't know whether is it because macam kita punya rumah is just so the window is just so closed up so that you you know you can't really like the wind tak masuk I did but the thing is when I wipe it kan there's still some a bit of moist
usually ya lah usually they will they have like some uh ventilation lah so that the tu so that the you know the surfaces would dry quickly
so that's the only thing lah I want to fix just the counter top I don't know whether is it as simple as just like knocking but do you know when you knock it out the apa tu pintu cabinet will pecah kan actually oh my god
so just now I was telling you I was talking about I was err my friend called ah from uh ya just like uh like so it was quite interesting because uh they needed a picture of a day doctor err then err the but suddenly you because the doctor is from our hospital tapi they need a doctor to be featured dia orang punya newsletter
but but the thing is the doctor submitted the picture that is not that they didn't meet their requirements of the but the printer lah so they needed us to take a picture then I was thinking like can't you just use the phone because the you know my Google Pixel ni I took I took a picture and err portrait punya macam mode kan
but when I when I send across kan it's at least three meg three four meg know that's why I don't get it macam why would you need like um a professional camera to take a photo when you can just take a photo with your phone and it is about three to four megabyte is it because like the newsletter is like dia require exactly three hundred because kita punya my mobile phone kan when I check uh is like hundred eighty
so no choice nak kena pakai lah
ya lah but we don't have so what I did to bypass it right is I shot I shot it in two apa tu two style eh two apa tu file format one is the raw one is the uh so kalau macam dia orang nak edit kan they just use the raw version apparently it works
that's what they that's what I did to bypass the macam the wall stickers I I don't know I don't know how to bypass it without having a so I just took into a in dua punya format then I send to the to the printer err not printer designer then I ask them to layout because it's a very big it's a big wall sticker you would say so you only I don't know whether you wanna if because our phone cannot take raw kan actually raw image it has to be set from a camera kan
are you planning to change your phone oh wait you change already ah I don't know whether I want to change a okay the thing is don't get me wrong I suka dengan my phone which is the model but I find it too big I just wanna pixel three I tak nak pixel but that time kan tak ada ingat tak I ordered online
it's it's really huge ah serious I just find it too huge but macam when I hold it on my palm kan I will need to stretch I punya thumb onto the other side of the screen just to type it
so I I was thinking I was torn between these two options either I ambil I ambil the ring and tampal you know the ring where you can put your finger inside and then you hold it or either I put the link card punya holder tu so I was thinking which one is more practical but of course is the link holder
the kids see that one they don't like tak sedap seh I don't like it's just damn weird oh but I like the ninja chicken burger though
love it I don't know the sauce is called nambam sauce or something like that namban tak pernah dengar seh that sauce
is never never heard before I pernah dengar macam miso err miso err teriyaki is like some people ask me whether is teriyaki I feel like is a mix of teriyaki and something salty I don't know what its chicken is nice you tak you tak try ke that time
kenapa kepala you pening tak minum air eh
you should just do eh tadi mana air I eh
oh ya anyway tadi weather was ya okay tadi the seller stop dekat mana
habis macam mana but is ready is ready ah
I'm just thinking like whether this person dia ada jangkit or what sebab tu dia tak kasi you picit the door bell no but don't even allow you to knock usually I don't mind knocking initially I don't mind knocking but door bell cannot doorbell is too loud
on the floor tak ada bench orh okay lor
that's very considerate of you all the deliveries yang I dapat all hang at the handle ah then I was like how am I suppose to open the gate without dropping it so I I pick up with my hand and then I open the gate nonsense kan that's very considerate and very thoughtful
so dua the dua is dari mana punya section
no but dia nak kena tulis apa like you accumulate like which is like blind spot okay right
tapi yang paling kelakar yang I tak faham is I punya kereta I pass sekali I punya motor I fail it one time
take so long to cakap I punya figure of eight eh take so long to finish lah figure of eight must be eight seconds
ya lambat must be more than six seconds
did I tell you some uh an accident that I witness on the on a plank orang ni dia err it was rainy um but ah it was sad lah because after dia I witness dia punya accident I think it was it will stay in my mind that I couldn't forget and then I fell on the speed you know the the you have to speed up your speed then you have to brake at the line ya correct so what happened at the plank was I was right behind this person
I tak tahu apa or kaki dia stuck or what kan dia went up the plank dia dah nak dah nak like maybe err err five metres or like maybe one or two metres away from the last one and then jatuh off and then dia punya gigi hit the another side habis chip off the two teeth chip and it was not a nice cut oh it was like a like a diagonal line
oh my god you I tengokkan dia and it was a guy yo I mean okay ah I'm I'm not saying that oh err guys should be okay girl shouldn't lah but seriously it was not even a test it was raining a practice session oh my god habis dia gini-gini dia asyik pegang dia punya gigi tau instructor ada instructor no but
but rabak he just trip like that you know even the whole gigi patah tau the dua gigi patah better kan
oh boleh eh as long as you find your because I I know he didn't pick up the thing ah
oh I see I though you tampal from the
sial oh I can't forget seh I tu dia terus kan I bailed I cakap is okay I think the plank very slippery I go the other one dia betul-betul I try the apa tu emergency break tu I think I step on the the the err back punya brake kan too hard dia punya is so weird tau the back tire just swing forward you know it's so fast you know it's just like swing macam ini seh then I drop on my left knee
tak lah tak pakai
eh ada knee guard ke ah
because you say nanti you penat lah you nak I bawa motor lah apa lah
it's just water what is not like rosak what
kejap kejap vendor for what the backdrop
oh habis sekarang
the vendor bail pasal you all make too much changes or the vendor bail pasal you all tak bayar betul-betul
uh huh habis
but not because you guys made banyak changes ah
apa nama company dia
you mean but the company is not father in law dia punya company ah
I see tapi you cakap lah maybe your kerja kasi you freelance
eh vendor tak nak buat dekat you all
the yang this video ni siapa yang minta dia
so the person that I don't really like tu yang siapa tu so this saturday this sunday she will officially become that number one lah
because I know whereby sitting as a board member you can err you will officially can become macam you voluntarily kan volunteer with err providing your remarks and everything kan so called strategic directions when you are just talking and complicating things right
that's like senang kata ah senang kata because too many cooks spoil the broth
the broth tak lah spoil the soup lah wait what's the what's the idiom again apa too many cooks spoil the apa apa soup what serious I suka ah berbual macam
pasal kita no
tak pasal kita pun sejak kita kahwin kan we only kita selalu keluar and berbual macam ini only when kita the before with kids are really easy our window is just like tanya okay dah alright any long conversation do it with a phone kan we are a phone phone ah what conversation ya
kalau lah boleh screenshot jer the text messages and then err verbalise it screenshot the old messages and then we just verbalise the the text messages that would be fun
aiyo I'm just thinking uh okay I'm just thinking yang sunday ni this sunday ni eh kejap you sunday eh this saturday you kerja kan sunday ada apa wait there's something on happening on saturday orh eddie kahwin habis why why your reaction like that
no but how do I tell my father that he can't come wait kita punya wedding is for what time to what time ah two hours jer kat pasir ris lah kan okay two thirty to four can nanti kita kita naik teksi sana unless you want to go the downtown east ah lepas tu
nak pergi downtown east tak lepas tu I don't know ya but I think nak kena book ah you know nak kena book you know eh no no no tapi I rasa dia orang nak pergi wild wild wet tau boleh kita pergi wild wild wet lepas tu
alah confirm the kids nak main the tayoh
wah that means this weekend we are completely filled alah eh this month siapa punya birthday lagi you cakap
no I mean family lah family siapa eh punya birthday
asal you tak ambil gambar bila you dah dapat kan senang
mm mana ada dah berhenti apa it's not lah ya lah ya lah
sorry ah I pakai contact lens please
kena lah it's just um the thing is that I have too many that I don't know which one to do first ya lah but usually
oh aduh the the the person yang email I ni dah apa tu ya yang tadi I berbual dengan dia tu dia dah email eh oh dia also macam I sama ah a'ah
tak lah what we are small fry we are obviously right that's why a'ah seh kita semua dari tu eh get that experience
dah lah that's the thing is lah a meritocracy world I don't know lah I just find that sometimes it's really the thing is dekat my place ni kan I don't know why is like your capabilities tak cukup tau you punya papers is to macam is to support dia punya capabilities padahal it's like
you ask the person to go to the kitchen you don't need to ask for that lah of course lah]basic is like have you pernah masak ke tak lah kan tapi doesn't mean tak pernah masak tak boleh masak benda sedap you know what I mean ya so I always give them this kind of theory so you suruh I buat something
but to compensate me to compensate me you cakap oh err I know you do a good job tapi but sorry you not wearing uh err this err nike shoes so you cannot be promoted you know it's just like you are just trying to find a excuse basically that's what that's how I how I feel so whenever I put into perspective to this kind of people just ya ya but it's not kita tak boleh buat apa-apa this kind of things are like beyond our hands oh the
then I will be like what then next time you ask me to do something I just say I could only do until this stage ya makes sense kan then bila I cakap macam tu will be like shit don't be too don't be too like err ini lah
see ah can can I just share with you about my work like the the things that I being asked to do you tahu I kena buat about this digital plan about this um publicity booking schedule tau this publicity booking schedule is not as easy as you ask for one to six eh I kasi one to six I have ten people who can be asking for one to six
so who do I give it to so it's really based I punya like okay for example maybe person A ada event then person B dia bukan event dia punya it's just a reminder ke some patient safety reminder so I have to give priority to uh ah I have to give priority to the A person kan but then the thing is sometimes is not as straightforward as that because what if
err you have three people who want to put reminders and you tak ada event so how do you negotiate so so that's the thing ah is it the thing is I can do it but it requires err half a day I cannot do this kind of planning kan macam like as a macam sikit-sikit sini sikit-sikit sana I cannot I need to do macam I need to really focus I need to do the schedule I will do the schedule for half a day that's how I do so sekarang ni so I don't even want to start on it
that admin person coming second jan a'ah wah because they are gonna serve notice one month at least so the thing is the funny thing about this person is itulah dia I don't know eh maybe err Q one end of Q one building up ya you dengar you dengar ni
actually I like something it's very funny tau this person yang masuk ni dia contact so many people around me except me tau to ask me about the job to ask about the job tau macam like
you could you just ask me what padahal kita but then I always like no orang yang dia tanya semua melayu like is like kau boleh tanya aku apa like ya shah aku dengar ada opening I mean macam we met every year because I give out the greeting cards and the apa tu the calendar and then at some point of time you need like publicity you also contacted me apa seh dia tanya orang yang dekat yang dah left a'ah macam dah transfer this one I tak tahu whether macam a'ah dia tanya sinar habis tu dia tanya meha except me
so I don't get it I mean like why would you ask somebody who who who left and orang yang tak kerja dekat department tu I don't get it seh
then I just like macam so I am a bit err I'm a bit like macam weary tau kalau macam why why she needs to tanya orang lain besides me because to me is I welcome internal transfer because I tak payah nak guide through macam that time ya because you can just ya because ya because you can just hit the ground running eh maybe they could have a better way
like bypassing certain things you know or work around certain things because the thing is although it's like a it's not a government a government sector kan dia ada we have more red ticks than the government you know and they very very macam very very rank conscious apparently you you macam like err of course I think sometimes what I want to tell my boss is that macam sometimes bukan
orang rank conscious tau is because like you tak boleh ask err a associate to be doing err punya kerja ya it's not a right what ans it is not because it's not it's nothing about do about your rank tau it's got to do with what you are paid to do you know so I I sometime I tak faham when people say like oh err you shouldn't be err you um saying that you just because you are associate you cannot do this
I mean is usually two sides to a coin ah you can see as like oh ya uh I shouldn't be err drawing lines about the work that I am doing but you also should look it at a perspective like if I keep doing this right then I'm being short changed and nobody likes to be short changed so for you to be saying this you are being selfish because at the end of the day you just want to get work done you don't care who but this person is is severely short changed so that that's the thing lor I I find that it's very hard to juggle kat at this this place I'm working at
dia macam tak dia tak err macam kalau kat yang kerja lama I ni dia very is very obvious tau macam you macam tadi my yang call I dia cakap dengan I err kat at least dekat kerja lama kita kan err we know okay this for this job cuma but the responsibility lies with the your degree holders the responsibility lies with them tau macam if thing goes wrong kan they are supposed to check
this and um they should be responsible um take responsibility for it and then now I heard they because they always change the person person kan ah baru punya orang and this person is from punya side lah so they are still learning the ropes to run that place ah side so apparently what I heard is they open more postings more openings for err diploma holders so dulu kan exactly so kan I bilang you there's ah err in that admission kan they have um
err the comms officer err assistant comms officer dengan abassir kan the one that I kan melayu they are very so now comms officer boleh pergi can take up the comms officer job
I know lah tapi macam ya no no but the thing is the opportunity to go tapi dia tak pakai tu ah ni ah tak pakai tudung ya so I mean it still applies lah I guess
I'm just thinking whether I should buy more of this err diffuser oil no wait I like it you don't like ah that's why you say macam the cockroach keluar malam-malam kan I mean dia orang mati kan I'm just thinking whether is it is it this smell that is causing them to be opening
unless it's like the baygon but the baygon cannot be is like dah lama sia I spray but if you notice this past few nights I tak spray tau maybe they just wanna commit suicide
I don't know no but err what I heard is you run over the tray kan you got you mati
no so what I did was I use the baygon I spray I spray a tray so the moment they pass this line kan they will die really you go and read about it is like you put them ya it's like baking soda so what they did was they put the baking soda punya powder tau then semua mati
bedak just normal bedak ah not bedak apa-apa
oh macam the the talcum powder eh
ah ada ada red colour yes okay
okay kita kena berbual english and malay
okay cuba cakap
because dia course by united
tapi class ni kenapa dia ah eight hours
mm tapi work from home ah
are you being paid untuk course ni
dah um semalam ada meeting err dekat conference room
ah aku gather all the ten of them lepas tu dalam ya ten of them split into two accounts
so dalam two account tu ada dalam
aku nya old team ada empat orang
err the other team ada enam orang
six six orang dalam team lepas tu kan ada social distancing kan so aku approach err safety manager ah minta pasal aku nak get the message relate to them across um but um I don't want to split the err dua dua team aku nak err two teams to dengar apa aku cakap as one so dorang tak confused
I want them to know the anyway boss aku memang the the day before
dia dah dah cakap dengan aku lah what to say dia cakap firstly about the unpaid cuti tu jangan
jangan bilang customer
don't tell the customer just say that we are clearing our leave tak tahu apasal boss suruh macam be confidential about it padahal it's quite known in singapore banyak orang sebab tu in the end um but I have to say what she say lah she's on leave dia tengah cuti so um during the meeting everybody um listen semua dengar semua ye so the two err explain that the two unpaid leave tu nak kena ambil december
february dengan march
then kalau macam the situation doesn't improve
err start for this err unpaid leave cuti kena ambil
compulsory you cannot macam bawa to the next err month you have to err settle lah within that month but rotate err every member kena ada backup dalam office
so that at least ada one person to answer customers' calls
kena ah so macam today is one of the unpaid ah
unpaid cuti err for december hari ni aku ambil dengan another day next week
so dalam bulan december aku kerja seven days only
best kalau boleh pergi holiday
and tak tolak gaji
ah free kan dapat
ya I think civil servants ada restriction kan
but two years eh kawan aku kata they don't know indefinitely
then macam mana um then how they clear the leave
I think they can break I think they will pay that time got ada keluar news apa
aku tak ingat apa ah tapi ada ada incentive the government say because they know that the civil servants cannot clear leaves
so cuti they will back they will back pay will cash or something
ada kan
for civil servants confirm ada that day baru ada pe they will they will pay the err they will bayar
tapi tak ada yang you know the apa usually apa bonus tu yang
extra berapa bulan for government civil servants ah that one tak should be tak ada adik aku pun tengah
she also mengeluh because
biasa ah kita dah beli beli beli barang we always macam nak kena
they hope they hope dia macam she hope for the bonus to
dia boleh bayar balik ah bill bill
kau tak perasan ke yang bila kau dah stop kerja then work from home ni that your your that your apa tu expenditure is lesser
tak lesser ke
motor masih keep ah
kereta memang necessary for korang pasal korang a family of enam
family of enam enam six cats seven cats
tapi alhamdulillah lah aku rasa ada berkat lah macam I'm sure somehow eh dia dia cukup tau cuma kita macam rasa macam we maybe because we don't see the the income coming in every month as a lump sum eh so we think macam
we are restricted tapi actually barang-barang semua masih still go on
dia penatnya apa bila kau kat rumah then dengan kerja while working nak kena tengok budak tengok rumah kemas lagi sebab tu macam overwhelming
time masa off
mm betul
jemput makan eh jemput minum sila kan
dah dah settle
bila dapat tu results
then dia nya first choice ah
yang yang okay what secondary school will that be
masa masa zaman-zaman kita tu the reputation not very good ah
oh but eh now maybe dah changed ke
oh the neighbourhood situ eh
tahniah for your result
ah jual besi
every month every month macam one point three for one account tau
so yang bulan lepas err our sales
cuma two hundred fifty eight K
tak drop banyak tu from one million err dia dia start turun bila tau bulan june july august
dah start to decline then the number of orders we used to get like hundred over orders dalam satu hari
sekarang satu hari dua tiga ke empat order macam system and it's like cutting metals for like a few inches orh really really very bad the demand drop
err dorang buat dorang assemble untuk ah the machine assemble untuk ah oil rig masuk kan dalam oil rig
so you know yang macam equinox err shell axon order kat all the oil rigs tu when they put things inside the down hole stuff too ah that metal they they buy from us kita kirakan macam distributor ah sell the metal kerja memang sebenarnya kerja aku ni jual besi
ada macam-macam size the round bars the tube all the tubings nanti they will order macam certain sizes then we need to look at the drawing sometimes they say ah we want to make something from this so what do you have dalam stock
to offer um benda-benda gini ah nanti dalam inventory tengok ah size yang kena ada abeh aku kena plan inventory for them the stock level must be always available so that bila dorang beli bendanya ada tak payah tunggu
cuma different product ah barang lain so
somehow yang bila yang last year tu bila aku dapat promoted tu from one account they ask me to also take over another account
so kirakan macam two accounts combined ni is the two biggest account dalam company mm
which is unexpected lah yang pasal aku kan baru habis cerai that time kan
then ah after the divorce tu
somehow ah aku tak tahu ah then the boss yang cina tu kata um we need to look into your portfolio you need to grow yourself so
then err dia tanya aku nak ke tidak macam if bukan aku dia akan offer to another person then the other person if not ambitious ah this girl dalam company aku ni there's another account manager yang very ambitious
then dia pursue dia punya degree at the same time I with her own money pasal dia nak aku rasa dia nak position boss aku boss aku asia and ah
asia-pac marketing and apa eh marketing and apa director
so dia kata if you don't take tak take up this position I'll have to offer to another person the your colleague
then the other person ni dia okay dia ambitious aku tahu it suits it suits her lah tu macam dia bukan ada
not someone yang there yet lah but pada aku macam not the
ah tak
bukan experience dia macam dia micro manage ah
abeh dia imposed macam kerja-kerja macam dia punya
dia bahasa kalau dia buat format eh
kalau aku buat format nak kena macam gini nak kena ikut tau team members semua kena ikut cara dia gitu ah dia akan check one by one kau buat kerja betul ke tidak like if you don't do it um betul-betul dia macam
dia send one email nanti dia kasi
dia buat ah step one step two step three really really micro manage punya kind of person jadi macam
aku pula bahasa agaknya aku tak teratur tak organise langsung
aku akan usually dengan budak dengan team members aku bilang dorang you do like this tapi pandai-pandai kau lah buat cara sendiri lah takde format punya benda tau dia lain dia bahasa kena ada format dia nak kena after this dot must have exclamation mark atau question mark that kind tau
very teratur very neat and tertib tulisan dia pun very tu kadang-kadang aku pun hairan macam mana dia boleh
aku totally opposite tapi boss aku cakap macam dia cakap err she will also be promoted but she will take care of the well head activities then aku take over the down hole activities so that time aku fikir err try jer lah ambil jer dulu lah that's how sekali dah take over dengan tahun ni dengan COVID ah kau sales baik dua account twenty one million ah tahun ni tak aku rasa
work wise ah work wise macam aku boleh manage ah cuma every night sekarang almost every night nak kena kerja
kena buat report
kat during the day tak there's simply not enough time mana answer customer nya email then err nanti ada quality issues lah supply chain issues logistic tak datang lah then at the same time kau kena check into inventory then check into macam housekeeping at the same time kita kena think of ways to reduce the inventory
macam-macam lah dalam satu hari one day you can like
tak boleh habis so nanti benda-benda report yang bahasa nak kena churn out data
aku buat malam kat rumah atau that time during work from home tu kan tu lagi productivity terus turun pasal siang anuh budak-budak take care of the kids punya tu
nanti aku macam takde aku tak boleh focus tau ah macam aku punya walaupun tak banyak kerja rumah aku boleh just let go tak buat apa-apa
tapi you can't macam tak boleh tau the data that you're you're doing at that point I rasa macam
takpe ah nanti I need macam quietness at the night baru aku buat ah tapi pada time malam aku dah tidurkan elly nanti aku dah energy aku dah gone that's why sometimes aku cakap telefon apa jamu nak ambil
yang deep station yang tu aku beli kan
itu aku rasa help with tangan aku that time
pasal bila lepas two months aku rasa macam takde effect aku stop tapi right after aku stop tu
about one month tu tangan aku clear tau dah tak gatal-gatal lagi tau there's a period aku remember aku jumpa liyana um she also noticed eh tangan dah baik your hand is better now
sekali one month aku tidur rumah aku start balik

tapi dia punya window
panel of windows saja biasa kalau buka tingkap
habuk masuk macam luar takde apa-apa tau is like the it's like a enclosed area
in between sebelah ada lagi satu neighbour jiran sebelah kirakan they won't be able to see the
the the scenery ah kirakan window dalam rumah tu semua buka takde view langsung
it's either to a close enclosed space atau um
tu rumah about aku rasa dia build in two year two O O two

every month cuma berapa jer
tapi you need the space aku rasa pasal kau ada empat anak tau sekarang
baru lah aku nampak satu action daripada only cats
luar this is nice this is just aku suka rumah kau to me macam just nice you ada
apa tu this dining area just sebelah dengan the kitchen abeh boleh nampak aku suka aku cakap dengan ati dia cakap alah I want something cosy macam like my friend house kan ada the the layout just nice tau the kitchen tak besar macam tak cramp then the dining area is just nice
then ada enough bilik like kalau kau satu perempuan satu lelaki
aira untung ah

err dia kata dia tak ada feelings already for ian
ian actually dah beli kan dia like birthday present tau he ordered
a small apa entah lah dia tunjuk aku
sekali that day I think he took it quite um dia tak badly lah tapi macam
dia macam shock ah macam tak tahu kan what what to how to what to do pasal dia everyday will will chat on the phone with the girl they don't they don't meet often
kalau meet ada kawan kau ada kawan-kawan together
um then the girl I think the err family dia very warak so seldom keluar
err and then I think she feels that macam
what for have relationship kalau macam jarang keluar she's very restricted by the family
dia sendiri kata macam I think dia macam can't be bother anymore just call it off lah
so ian okay she they started to I think the way they handle it was during the circuit breaker period what so kat rumah dia main game dia tengok dia nya YouTube dengan netflix
huh semua orang dengar
kau ni astagfirullahazim
bila kau nak kena sound aku balik dah pukul satu
kita masih ada time
a'ah eh kita macam boleh randomly berbual-berbual aku rasa tak habis-habis
sabar lah ye siapa yang dengar ni listen
dorang nak kena they have to calculate tau like how many percentage of apa yang kita berbual sekarang is err in mother tongue or in english
bismillah banyak-banyak kalau dia orang islam
dia dia tak speak melayu langsung like mixed mixed pun tidak
kita kita no no problem eh
all the way eh cakap
pasal aku rasa daripada tadi kau berbual kan ada banyak english daripada melayu
bayar tak ah
ya nanti they collect the data eh
tapi but tapi surprisingly ramai yang tidak hantar never never a lot didn't send anak-anak dorang pergi
maybe they don't need the childcare punya service ke
perkembangan apa yang what do you see dalam in dorangnya development eh
ya bagus seh
government aided nya sekolah
mm mungkin dekat dekat near the neighbourhood don't have atau takde maybe all maxed out no no space
hmm ada program activities yang tolong dorang develop certain milestones and the guide they are guided
kalau dekat rumah bibik will help to take care of them tengok-tengokkan
tapi jarang lah ada bibik yang also like
engage them with activities yang
boleh buka minda cukup tak aku punya melayu
aku pernah pe keluar dengan perempuan dua kali
dinner dengan lunch ah
dinner dengan lunch aku bayar siol
pasal aku was like err apa nama dia
aku lupa dinner kita makan apa but
itu pasal apa eh
pasal aku aku nak tengok ah dia offer ke tidak then aku don't mind paying ah
cuma wah kau terus macam diri tepi jer eh
tak cakap apa-apa eh oh okay lor
I mean the fact that that macam
entah macam kena buat pakai ah
just want to have a good fun apa
like macam
macam that time ah macam aku pergi yang aku dekat zouk that time
then ada satu aku tak tahu siapa how the conversation was brought up ah but
berbual jer ah
apa nama dia the si ada satu perempuan tu ah macam
kita nampak satu perempuan then aku tak tahu how it was like ah ni dah lama gila but then satu orang cakap kan alamak but she's
she got boyfriend already ah bro aku pernah cakap ni tak
then after that satu budak ni ah lupa siapa nama dia terus datang he a part of that group ah cakap bro bro
if she's single lah you're fighting with everyone in the club bro dia kata gitu same thing ah
like which not written anywhere where kau ada cakap what I mean but it's an agreement between two people
but the same time if the two people have the agreement like macam kat france they have they have open relationship like I can sleep around whoever I want but at the end of the day I with you that kind of thing kan
like macam that time aku tak boleh tidur ah like
aku tengok Twitter and like romanticism kan
macam wah annoying gila sia
like macam kau expect benda-benda merepek tau everything
like macam benda-benda macam merepek oo sweet nya sweet nya terus macam apa yang kau sweet sangat siak
like macam
tak tahu ah handphone tengah record kalau tak aku dah buka Twitter aku dah tunjuk all the things that
oh that ada this girl ah there's this girl who ni mata air aku bilang there's this girl dia pakai tudung abeh dia nya boyfriend ada angkong semua
like macam tu so sweet macam she accepted him macam okay then after that like macam orang dia kata orang kat Twitter cakap gitu
terus macam err okay
ya then after that like macam
err err apa nama dia
then the boyfriend keep on kissing dia punya cheeks kind of thing then macam err then recently ah the boyfriend go and message her the way he message her saying that
um singaporean bi I don't need sex ah I can wait I can live without sex
terus aku nak kata lah if he's not fucking you he's fucking with someone else lah
then macam
apa yang macam merepek ah like that's the thing tau macam bila aku dapat tahu pasal romanticism kan
ikut perasaan tau perangai macam lembik perangai macam kental ikut just to like macam
like macam
ah I don't know how to explain ah nak kena tengok Twitter ah then after that aku can
really ah aku tunjuk aku can actually come to senses ah like tunjuk kau macam aku ambil
kita punya kedai handphone ada Twitter
banyak ah jap eh
eh takde eh
takde Twitter ah
camne eh nak explain
oo best ah kau kena tengok ah eileen the burton
eileen the burton ah eh for example ah the things yang dia highlight
yang benda yang dia highlight is like especially macam perempuan do this padahal kita pun buat laki pun buat like macam kita padahal kita buat not only with kita partners dengan members pun sama tau like macam kau tak tahu pe aku satu minggu penat macam for example dan it can be as simple as dan
this week aku penat gila ah kalau tak boleh turun boleh that kind of thing tau but we expect him to understand that eh kau dah bodoh pe
aku hari-hari kerja kau masih nak lepak sini ah that kind of thing ah it's like it's as easy as bro uh this week I quite full lah cannot come to the shop or not that kind of thing
ah this kind of thing ah so dia kata if it's a true love or if it's true friendship if you understand each other without saying which doesn't makes sense ah
abeh dia kata like macam we expect to do that we expect
macam for example dia cerita kan ah from a real life punya experiences dia balik
dia balik then after that err anak dia anak dia baby dia give anak dia some food anak dia tepis toddler ah nangis terus
kalau bini dia dah sepak ah I mean dia kata aku dah bingit gila ah dengan bini aku but he's my son lah but what I did was I try to understand him
like macam why did he why did he behave this way dia nak berak ke pampers dia ini ke dia gigi nak grow ke gini gini ah that's why then after that that was thinking ah dia kata dia macam why can't I behave
ah like macam senang cakap bila kalau
benda gini we always talk about girls kan macam eh what's wrong nothing that kind of thing like you can just tell me
but that's the thing ah like but at the end of the day also most guys also dorang tak tahu how to talk about
emotions macam suami kan
macam if they feel something diam
dengan dan pun diam unless kita brought it up really force him to talk about it then he will talk about it
a'ah tu pasal ah dorang tak ada orang ajar I mean like they
in a way lelaki kan
that's why dorang macam ah tak kesah pasal for example kalau laki laki ah siapa-siapa nak keluar kan
kita punya anak sedara ke siapa pe bapa pun macam nak pergi mana keluar take care eh jangan naughty naughty eh perempuan nak keluar kita kongkong that kind of thing lah like macam
laki we are just left to be everybody understand everybody have a way of thinking that guys are they can make it out there ah quite expected to know everything or like kau should know find for the answers
kita is still need a manual pe in some ways cuma that differentiate people lah like how they actually view things ah like some people they will macam
tak tahu continue to be lost lost lost lost lost lost sampai ke mampus anak bini semua masih lost ada kalau people have gone through a lot of shit kan then after that macam eh things cannot happen like this ah I want to find something better baru dorang improve
macam that time yang client aku hugo tu whoa
sama ah like macam abeh nampak dia tengah going undergoing stress tau a lot pasal bini dia kat portugal and dekat sini semua
abeh berbual dengan dia berbual berbual habis terus aku just open up ah aku just ah butoh lah aku cakap pasal bapa aku semua kan
aku cakap err apa nama dia
oh like macam that time bapa aku gaduh kat kerja tak ada orang defend dia that kind of thing then macam see everybody expects guys to like
macam siapa lelaki ada siapa nak berbual takde siapa-siapa pe
dan dah macam
okay ah we have no one macam you know then my friend ah kata ah aku tengah stress kawan aku kata
you know I'm not the up for the psychiatrist thing dia kata
laki ah laki you you don't know how to open up pe
a'ah it's seram
macam that time aku dengar satu talk tu ex-feminist kan aku dah cakap kan dia buat documentary dia feminist
and dia buat documentary ironically pasal err apa nama dia dia buat documentary about macam opposite of feminist ah kira men ah men fighting for men's right dia interview ni semua biasa tapi asal dia kerja
dia shut off that side of dia punya feminist side ah so kepala otak dia semua dia just judge whatever comes up to their mouth kan dia just judge
then bila
it comes to editing she have to listen what to everything so dia dia have to edit out filter all the content so dia realise never once
the guys were talking about ah apa nama dia

honestly kalau kau ada problem kat diri sendiri susah apa kau nak buat unless
is is kau hina diri sendiri and work something out macam
kau susah nak terima apa macam diri sendiri it's like killing part of yourself tau
tapi it's very easy to judge people pe
this what happening ah macam kau zip kau punya mulut sudah

kau tak pernah tengok cerita tu when they see us

raping ah charged rape and murder oh but they were totally innocent but dia nya system inside dia nya ah police
so fucked up that they will separate the kids without any macam apa parents or lawyers kan dia dorang cakap okay that guy from another room
blame kau yang anuh mm that guy from another room blame kau yang anuh but then this guy another room they keep blaming each other but no one blames themselves ya so dorang make it like a story by dorang dia punya problem
end up macam kecoh ah now dorang dah tua sia sekarang
rabak sia tu
actually donald trump ah who ah that time kata donald trump banyak
keluarkan wrongly ah wrongly reason black people out
orang buat people will do things but then if in matter of the in the in the matter of kau tahu ke tidak is siapa yang sampaikan media apa that's why media is they say
sometimes aku ada fikir balik whether trump is really racist atau tak
kau tengok eh
before trump was a president fifty cents semua rapper semua suka fifty cents ni semua suka trump sia
aku grow up hip-hop pe trump memang
respected ah tu fifty cents kata eh dia jadi president semua orang benci dia
pasal dia pandai dia businessman apa
first punya election cause whatever you see on the media is just a for example forty per cent of americans the most americans semua like next ni semua dekat kampung-kampung so when you go to kampung-kampung I want to make
america great again orang semua suka kau ah ah so you get the majority votes
aku lupa ah
pastu dia dia pada aku kan
at the end of the day kalau kau dah enam puluh tahun kan life kau memang macam atuk nenek kita pun dorang cakap benda annoying pe that's one thing second thing kan this guy
new york kalau kau boleh hidup dengan mafia you can work with mafia to create trump tower when the workers who built that tower is mafia nya macam mafia control them but ni kau dah bagus mafia control everything new york
apa nama dia concrete bricks ni semua semua dia control
abeh kalau kau boleh survive that makna kau bukan bodoh sia
tu ah macam cakap world is being too soft ah
like macam that's the thing pasal aku macam aku nya aku selalu step macam jahat
jadi terlalu baik cause I have to acknowledge the devil the shadow kalau you err psychologist ah dia cakap kau nak kena face your demons kau kena acknowledge kau punya demons
so all these closet perverts ah be that all these closet perverts ah dia macam
um macam macam kau semua kita cakap pe kita open kita gini gini gini punya orang kita tak bedek kita tak macam
tak ah aku baik baik baik padahal musibat
ni kalau kau bersih pun maknanya kau hidup macam kermit ah hermit
pasal it's not human pasal apa-apa yang ada dekat kita itu semua part of feelings
pada aku is wrong to apa
feel a certain way but it only jadi wrong when you act upon it
kalau kau act upon it means kau dah conclude the whole
macam salah a'ah macam siapa nama dia
ah dalam islam umar
umar paling fierce placebo
no matter is considered allah
umar umar bila orang kata rasulullah meninggal kan
dia kata pe satu kali korang cakap kat aku rasulullah meninggal aku pancung korangnya kepala
abeh terus err apa nama dia
it's the other aku pernah dengar this talk orang ni cakap ustaz dia aku ni pemarah gini gini macam
bermakna it's not wrong we have to chill lah paling sekarang siapa next ah apa err the third khalifah a khalifah is someone paling garang sekali pe
macam you got to chill lah it's what you do you do
tu aku tak suka orang cakap ee kau ni
err cepat marah seh cepat marah I mean like pada aku cepat marah is a bit people who are very attune with their emotions
macam people want entah lah orang just
sebab tu lain orang lain pe
macam aku dengan mata air aku selalu macam aku cakap raised punya voice kan I'm not angry I'm just I mean I mean I'm I'm not angry at you I'm just I'm trying to acknowledge my feelings but when I raise my voice macam kadang aku tak marah dia it's just macam kita berbual pasal something ah we get hype up macam I'm not angry at you I'm just ah accepting the fact that I am angry about this
at least aku tak terbawa-bawa ah at least aku tak like macam
err apa nama dia
step ah step baik tak acknowledge ah I'm fine I'm fine
butoh I'm fine
kau hide it under the rug wonder the rug will be big enough sia kau dah tak tahu mana nak buang kau punya angry
dah berapa lama ah
tiga puluh tiga puluh thirty three
okay ah this is about korean show ah eh korang jangan judge aku
this one korean show aku tengok pun sama pasal apparently this one kid
macam dia nya life just
memang fucked up ah memang rabak ah but then she work inside this company whereby dia banyak tolong orang ah but then at the same time
sampaikan orang tap
into other people's phone untuk dengar conversation semua
terus friendly orang yang this guy another guy in dia nya company kira orang dia baik gila ah macam bukan nak cakap baik gila but then he's
entah macam very straight ah with dia nya principles dia kira cakap sometimes certain things kau shouldn't kalau kau dengar
kau shouldn't say
certain things kau dengar kau just keep it to yourself pasal kalau kau benda benda macam gini eh kau boleh disrupt orangnya friendship even though macam aku dengan kau gini kan aku dengan kau macam okay depan korang aku baik
belakang korang aku might be talking shit but sometimes that is the kind of thing that sometimes people just want to express dorangnya feelings it's not meant for the other person to hear ya
so dia cakap I know you're working but kau kena fikir balik apa kau buat pasal this kind of things it will disrupt orangnya life
that's why macam pada aku orang yang macam step baik kan whenever someone said something bad they will assume oh dia ni jahat
pasal kau tak pernah acknowledge anger you don't understand anger
macam aku just nak cakap jer ah aku not satisfied with this what's wrong with that
sebab tu that time aku sangkut sia cakap ni apa ah ah nama cerita dia is my minister
bagus sia
it's not about a okay ah very like ten per cent about love like the most is about dia punya how fucked up the whole situation is ah
pada aku semua cerita best ah korea ke apa ke
that's why aku quite shocked sekarang macam aku quite interested to macam tengok like korean shows
pasal dorang kan kalau kau tengok balik korean they are very well attune to dorangnya feelings
tu pasal aku suka tengok cerita lucifer
oh asal pasal yang macam dia acknowledge whatever feelings pasal he's not human mm he's not human abeh dia jumpa psycho ah psychopath pula dia jumpa psychiatrist dia and dia talk about feelings oh ya
and like macam the way dia take it like macam oh aku feeling this way eh is it ah that kind of thing ah so macam interesting
wah then dalam one of dia nya show dorang aku dengar this this guy cakap
macam dia tak tahu tak tahu apa dia nak tak tahu apa what's going on around the world dia buat hal dia macam gini sakit hati kau mampus ah macam gitu ah dia clueless about everything around
sun tzu cakap dekat art of war
I mean if you look at life as a war kan macam everyday is a constant battle ah
you can battle with a lot of things ah dia kata
kau kena tahu diri kau kau dah tahu the people around you ah
whatever everything kau pada aku aku boleh relate ni benda ah and then like
macam walaupun bila orang tu buku ni dia tulis untuk war pe but then you can look at it into business in life
macam battle ah for example
sekarang eh
the battle is for me to win korangnya hearts boleh cakap gitu pe
abeh macam I trying to win a friendship I want to get this kinship between us that's a battle also pe so kau nak kena tahu diri kau kau kena tahu kau punya people apa kau suka pasal apa kau suka apa apa kau tak suka and then from there aku boleh win the battle lah
aku pernah sia that time tengok after that watching dia nya like the series kan aku balik rumah aku just hate everyone
that's walking around aku sia aku macam like fuck sia korang like
aku macam aku tengok semua orang macam korang like do you guys see all these things that's banyak orang tak nampak
ah macam sial lah tak ah macam like these kinds of things that happened in the dark ah macam usually orang nampak semua macam let's say
a'ah from apa orang tunjuk jer pe
pasal sometimes no matter how bad the person is also kan kau nak kena tahu like what make him that way
tapi pada aku macam no matter how bad the person pada dia dia dia betul ah ya lah that's why like macam ada orang kata like
someone else's war is someone else's peace something like that lah dia punya line
it's like pada aku like macam wow it's like kalau kau nak kahwin
kau nak anak kau islam kau tak boleh kahwin dengan orang christian pe mm pasal pada dia minum no problem whatever dia believe in is different than yours
so to them after that korang gaduh then tak boleh cakap salah siapa pasal korang believe in different things
ya lah means like dia macam
that time adik aku pernah cakap ah dia bilang aku cakap kalau let's say eh the relationship korang gaduh in a relationship kan korang gaduh make sure korang berbual with each other face to face mm then gaduh quarrel with inside
ah that's not me ah yes kalau kau nak quarrel dengan aku kau quarrel dengan aku aku sendiri
macam that time aku text mata air aku dia kata apa
kau mesti ingat eh kalau aku tumbuk sesiapa sekarang kan okay let's say aku tumbuk kau kan if you get punched the only pain yang aku with the puncher is accountable for is when dia punya fist hit kau punya muka other than that kan tu semua self-inflicting pain
ni macam yang johnny depp member amber heard ah
oh dia tu lagi satu sia kesian sia
berbual kan a'ah aku ada dengar sikit juga
johnny depp tengah kecewa
ah terus end up jadi pukul pula
in a way dia punya suara like they just dia bukan marah tau dia just disappointed with what she turns to ah
like sebelum tu aku nampak kau macam wah like she's that perfect girl then suddenly
once that's why macam
ah tu pasal ah
macam apa romanticism dia cakap like macam one thing dia tak suka pasal romanticism ah is
first love macam
kau tengok jer kau dah tahu tu dia punya kau punya love one he questions the one kau tengok kau belum kenal that person tau
macam everything is based on feelings
abeh dia kata the only normal person eh
semua orang semua tak normal actually semua orang messed up
kau tak tahu dia punya problem tu pasal dia kata like macam
it's best to have a communication ah like macam bila kau jumpa orang kan I rather don't believe in like oh dia ni cantik ah kalau kau rasa dia cantik maknanya kau suka dia physically then after that kau get to know that person ah
then slowly like macam
ah then work things out from there ah you have to know like macam oh
does dia love aku macam
cause some people dalam dia some people
pasal when it comes to love kan cause suffering also come to place juga
dia dia dorang ada ratio dia
banyak orang kita can vibe with
best sia romanticism nya talk pasal I mean
even though aku suka dengar pasal tu kan it's not that aku tak romantic as well at all tau
like macam eh I cannot behave this way towards my girlfriend cause it will make her have this romantic mindset which would actually damage the relationship in the future
err ya like macam gitu ah expectations ah like macam a lot of the things ah like macam merepek ah tak masuk akal ah
aku need kau ada Twitter tak lis
tak pakai ah tapi ada dekat handphone kau
pasal aku nak kena tengok some examples ah
eh actually aku boleh ah tengok pakai ni aku boleh record sambil ni takpe aku tengok Twitter dari aku punya ni
handphone then aku aku highlight some of the romantic romanticism punya ah ni
vulnerable lah like macam kau takut nak jadi vulnerable
a'ah kau tak nak
oh azmi ah azmi cakap apa
si azmi pun
dia kes dia punya orang pun dia apa tau dia kata macam dulu dia macam kita macam baru kenal dia kata diam dulu relax
but then what make him change was he went travelling then like macam only on the third day baru dia berbual dengan orang terus macam dia punya last day kan ataupun orang tu last day
terus macam eh sial ah gerek gila sia
when I can talk to you in the first day and then we have a great time together sejak dari situ dia just macam open jer ah dengan semua orang dia boleh berbual ada selamba jer dia berbual jer ah
you cannot force the process ah macam kalau dia cakap gitu aku pun takleh expect anyone to oh betul eh aku try gitu cannot cause you have not gone through that process
you never truly understand it ah so if you skip the process memang
plus kita busy with a lot of things
err apa nama dia ah to throw away ah
and like really ni satu annoying perempuan pergi screenshot mata air dia gi send
tak this is all the stuff that aku scroll aku nampak ah
perempuan love this kind of shit pe
panjang gila mampus eh macam si dia tu highlight ah
err apa nama dia dia kata romantic romanticism can only be practised pada orang yang tak kerja orang yang tak ada goals in life
macam you want that macam that is not healthy sia
macam hundred of hundred per cent of your time or ninety per cent eighty per cent is being
err spend on someone tau dia macam just talk shit just make yourself feel better I love you you love beautiful that kind of thing kau spend pages tu semua
kau tahu macam you can spend time writing this tapi kau tak boleh write benda-benda yang lagi berfaedah
like macam
ah like macam god meant to take someone macam sial ah
ni cantik cantik tell him queen
macam ah
hais sial laki ni ha padahal aku belum tengok dia kata laki ni sial I mean like oh okay so you have to lie now
dan ah macam dulu dan macam oh thanks bro macam whoa best pe dan ada dekat sini
sekarang apa-apa dan buat nanti syahmi will find a reason to hate on it
pada aku ni macam a little bit romanticism in a way
I mean like macam
to to a certain extent okay lah there are some guys who just like openly like ni semua macam that's the thing like macam
aku tahu sia macam from experience I know girls
who secretly wants some guys sial lah living okay tak payah pergi jauh adam sendiri siak berapa banyak attached women go to him
the fuck is that abeh kau nak come to aku like macam kau nak pure gila nak mampus
macam no I only think of you macam
kau jangan bedek ah kita manusia ah sial
dia kata one of the things that
sex and marriage sex and love intertwine so dia kata apa tau
when you kira
and then err apa nama dia err
so they intertwine sex dengan love so if someone can treat you like good
bagus gila nak mampus tau
sweet tapi dia tak boleh fuck you well ah
kau terus down
kau macam oh this is not true love
or in a way ah tu pasal how I see it ah like most girls kan bila dia dah give themselves too easy to a guy
yang apa nama dia ini ah dia kata like macam so aku macam try to understand tau
kadang mata air aku ada sikit annoying ah which is aku understand pada aku like macam
dia believe in romanticism ah
before dia know aku pe so like err
I mean like it's a like confirm confirm tak boleh tau
and like macam kalau kau buat maknanya dah end of the story that kind of thing
it's not that aku nak main orang lain or what ah
but it's just that when you place that kan so slowly kau subconsciously
kau punya mind will go lower and lower in a sense that
err kalau apa nama dia that mind macam so kalau kau like orang lain kan sexually dah kira salah kalau kau have fun kalau that time dia ada issue with aku keluar kawan aku perempuan aku dah kenal dari dulu dah lama gila
terus dia tengok story macam eh you look you seem more happier with her tu aku dah kenal dia berapa lama macam aku aku happy pun salah ke
that kind of thing like macam so they will like if someone can replace can if someone can give him happiness
maknanya that person is for him then macam happiness comes in different form
so kau jangan think it the way just cause gini abeh kau down
abeh like macam oh dia dah tak suka aku like this
takleh keluar tak ada kawan tu semua that's what overthinking is a more commonly err
ya happen in that situation ah so macam all these toxic punya
toxic punya pemikiran ah
and like macam
pada aku most of the time kita tak gaduh it's just that disagreement jer ah like macam we talk about something disagree macam dan dengan ni
ah dan dengan mel
tapi tak sampai kita merajuk it's just that aku disagree atau certain things like macam dia kata I cannot sleep ah terus macam asal oh I
don't overthink kau bilang aku jer asal let me talk to you lah like macam
ease your mind sikit ah apa aku boleh buat dia cakap tak nak nanti menyusahkan kau
abeh terus nanti kalau dah bilang then after that dia come to conclusion that dia overthinking abeh dia ingat macam
oh aku selalu buat orang susah lah aku selalu macam kita kena gaduh pada aku ni tak gaduh
ini bukan gaduh it's just us communicating jer
can you stop pasal that's the thing
macam all these romanticism kan benda-benda gini fikir gaduh
pada dia kan love is love hundred per cent all the time having fun
that is like the the extreme err apa view of romanticism ah we have three more minutes my friend
dah terlalu banyak benda personal if you're listening to this
tadi korang cakap berbual pasal happiness pun macam
it's just like macam how orang europe confirm pergi holiday dekat bali
dia kata ee
like macam
pada kau mesti ah pasal kau punya standard lain apa dia punya standard lain
macam dulu aku bilang aku pernah bilang korang tak aku berbual dengan razi then razi tanya aku
where do I see myself in ten years dia tanya aku
dia cakap aku cakap tu ni tu ni ah then cakap aku kan semalam dia datang aku berbual dengan dia terus cakap razi kau ingat tak yang kau bilang aku ni
dia cakap ah
tu lah selama ni kan from then until now
aku seen like
aku know a lot of things which I mean bukan nak tahu that which is right atau wrong
aku want something aku can say now
aku successful seh
I don't like have a girlfriend or anything but aku cakap aku feel successful sia cause aku feel like comfort now aku don't have anything else to worry
pasal some people dorang cakap okay money sebab aku dah ada duit banyak
maybe that's to you lah pasal we have a goal pasal aku takde pasal aku dengan razi aku cakap aku feel right sekarang kan macam with apa yang aku ada
kau tahu aku cakap this is success to me ah
kau tahu macam orang kata more money more problem kan
true sia like macam aku dapat ni punya ni

kau kau spend your money sekarang tapi nanti kau stress tapi aku nak stress sekarang aku nak aku sekarang tengah fikir where should I put this money I want to make this money grow that kind of things

doing the thing because mak dia macam macam gila

err entah that one I don't know
enjoy enjoy seratus lima puluh dolar yes
but I know tak dapat exactly something is wrong somewhere I hope they accept my recording but
eh eh masih brighter ah
ye lah
lagi empat minit setengah satu jam eh
empat minit I think this one is created for
tapi ni baru beli last year
ah october I was in hawaii going to oslo beli beli beli
at least I got this stage the other one jap tadi tak boleh
continue lagi dua setengah minit then we can stop already
okay harris we are surviving this err terima kasih lah kerana
hancur melayu participate macam tu eh participate uh terima kasih kerana berbual dengan saya atas voice recording err thanks thanks very much for helping me with this project and
kalau boleh mungkin next time again lah but
because sometimes when you speak melayu and english it's not it's not difficult to switch but I mean
I think when you cannot find the right word in english then you will like or the brain will just tukar-tukar
check bank siapa nak check siapa nak bank
dia macam ah there's one application that I tried is ah mystery shopper
so then they pay you upfront ke or they
that means doing the pharmacy punya side lah but the problem is I have to
I can only work until december but then dia orang cakap cannot they have to I have to commit at least one year
wasted right and then the uh apa ni we the we bounce email back and forth back and forth and then ended up you know what my colleague got it
mm tapi dekat jems kau
ya I can actually kerja dekat uh sana kan if they can ini but then too bad
that's why then another one I tried is uh apa ni
but that one is uh apa ni that one pun uh ada shift ah seven to
even uh temperature taking also they ask you to apa ni they will ask you to commit for at least
tapi dormitories is very risky because
no because sometimes it's up to the apa tu management to
tapi nanti dia last minute there's always a lot of changes and the changes are always come
say one week before lah macam like this week right by thursday friday they will tell me my next week schedule to confirm
what day I'm working so hopefully tak ada change
tapi kalau ada change then susah lah how am I going to call the ini kan the other job
correct that's why I think my colleague kan dia tak nak she doesn't want to do this uh macam because one thing the part time that the unity one you cannot choose
ya she requested for a full time tapi bagus kau dia punya because of
actually they are looking for a cashier cum store assistant take stock all these ah tapi because of dia punya qualification and maybe also because she want to do full time right
ya I mean it's good for her also anyway she's dia dia pun I think on work pass eh
mm because we cannot my current employer dia cakap if let's say you're on work pass because a few of them were asking can they
so they are asking if they can go back to their country and then still work as per normal lah but so just log in apa
it will I think there's some law thingy ah and then kesian kan all these uh
passes holder like because what they are thinking is dia orang nak save on rental
ah then down there tak ada imagine one person rent one room like five six hundred and then now your pay is like half
kesian seh
because dia cakap that time kan ah during the COVID period then all these malaysian tak boleh balik
the father passed away a few years back lah so he staying the whole house alone and then dia cakap ah he advertise on gumtree um
apa ni dia cakap ada all these during this period whereby the malaysian cannot go back
with aircon and with uh that's it tak keluar pun and all these factory workers they are working at night right so they are during the day they are at home
whereas si azman ni pula uh dia kerja
and then at night he say he have the house to all to himself tak kecoh-kecoh you know
ya and then anyway they come back also just to sleep so I ask him then cooking how dia cakap cooking because all male
uh I think five room also ah dekat woodlands
tu dia cakap uh because his pay was uh cut I think about thirty percent eh thirty
thirty percent ke forty percent so the rental income that he got makes up for the pay that he kena cut
but I guess it's okay lah because he's a guy abeh dia pun macam tak keluar bilik unlike macam perempuan kan suka keluar
but cool right I mean like you don't really have to struggle lah macam ada job ada job tak ada job tak ada job anyway I have extra income
tak boleh order tak boleh keluar makan I mean like once in a while
so that's why then what about your side your company okay tak
those who are urgently need to balik kampung or urgently need to go travel for business sign contract or whatever thing right
are mostly macam like attracting you you know and then like you say maybe is just to collect data so once the
lepas tu bila kau dah kasih kau punya resume apa semua then they will say okay we will call you once there's any opening
ya I guess tapi ten K eh
she said she rented one condo dekat uh harbourfront down there per month is five K you know
tapi bila sometimes ah when it comes to their private travel ah wah then the the wife can be bossy
that's why sometimes I hear complain from ah macam
ah I also got one experience because apa ni dia punya secretary punya boss the boss is a very nice guy you know
and then ah uh every year they have this uh macam trip home trip lah so call home leave
as long as the amount don't exceed if exceed the amount then of course they have to top-up themselves um so if they don't use and then just rugi lah it's like forfeited
then lepas tu kan nanti along the way there will be changes of course
uh apa ni kenapa deduct eh I think about two two hundred thousand or something like that it's a lot you know it's a lot of amount
so dia cakap uh did he upgrade or any he asked me to check dia kata bila krisflyer actually deduct salah or what
nothing we don't do anything with krisflyer or anything uh we didn't do any claim lah check punya check rupanya wife dia
aku tanya dia uh apa ni so the
ya funny right can you imagine he sekali ah he keep keep keep the point to do something or to bring the family out or what sekali ah the
dia punya wife claim everything siao
ah every time like that nanti karang uh apa tu you I I purposely want to travel with this airline because I
I got this card and then I want to claim mileage here I want to macam-macam lah
ya because the fare pun if you take the lowest you cannot claim mileage
but if let's say you take the highest one the one that uh got no rule ah macam
yes lepas tu the company is telling us to save cost
so of course we have to choose the lowest right and then when it comes to changes dia bising
susah seh but you never know what sometimes ah last minute changes or last minute nak kena pergi sana pergi sini
but some of the traveller I will tell them I say no no no your boss better don't ini
remember that time yang kau punya si ex
terbalik right
aiya for actually for them ah definitely they want to they will apa ni push push to somebody what
book lepas tu tak check and then just give
baru dia cakap don't don't repeat the same mistake
ni apa flight actually you take
no I think it's expensive pasal ah it's either a different airline or you buy a one way ticket
actually ho chin minh ada banyak flight apa vietnam air I think at least got three or four flight
other than that ada budget airlines
of course it's not funny lah you crazy macam I can imagine you don't have anything down there and then here he call you and you are laughing away
tak messy sangat pasal kan if you were to do like that ah macam like
macam departure for saturday I do then departure for monday you do both hotel and flight
so it's by by departure date tau dia bukan macam
you know if you have always if you have a group of people travelling ah it's very messy so you have to see macam
aku cuma ambil yang departure on the saturday
tak pasal the different website got different allotment why sometimes ah like macam ah agoda they got ten ten room
so that's why if you go agoda all the ten rooms are booked tapi bila you go to booking dot com maybe they are still five rooms available
tapi actually if you want to play safe right for for this type of group or what you should just contact the hotel directly
tapi okay ah because okay lah macam let's say it's individual booking
I'm sure they have their own bilik tau
nanti they will expect they will know that there's a group booking they are expecting you tak from this company this company ah so it's easier
I think it's china hong kong tak payah visa
tapi kalau china visa ah
ah apa tu passport I think it's about three hundred dollars
ah you can still it depends ah tapi
kalau if they are travelling around asia pac ah you definitely have to check they will definitely need business visa
cuma kalau dia declare as tourists then they don't need
tapi tourist also you don't declare as tourist then you wear your jacket smart smart tie all go of course they don't believe you lah
but luckily tak payah I mean they don't have to is a paper visa you don't have to stamp it on the passport
aku rasa kalau tu baru lagi dia jump
it's just the you know dia punya screw dia terpleot
I mean don't judge a book by it's cover tapi
the company is like neither here nor there kalau kau apply for a job and let's say you get a job
susah lah
well maybe if you see that probably all the linkedin punya tu is under recruitment agency no harm just go lah anyway they just want to collect data what
first of all I want to know right shu tu siapa

then dia orang punya pasal lah then dia orang punya pasal lah then you want to comment right fine lah you can comment you can fine lah you can go ahead
at times right macam I feel that it's err
err from what I know lah macam he made a video like reviewing her reviewing her work
so macam then
look at how macam she got reviewed and all that I mean okay I
to me right to me eh the only wrong right they only wrong eh yang the you only wrong that
if in my very humble opinion lah the only wrong yang dia buat kan is
like my also eh also apasal budak-budak zaman sekarang kan you guys are so drawn right to simple stupid shit
okay is because you all budak-budak zaman sekarang right love nonsense eh like TikTok and
okay if that was the case right can you tell me ah agak-agak kan
what kind of orang kan is selalu buat benda macam ni
what type of what type of what type of orang
like the fact you right the fact is macam
male err like these YouTube celebrities right that's why or like ridhwan right because macam I don't see any of the things that they do right macam
applicable to my life useful in useful useful in my life right or macam I don't see them possessing any characteristics right which I as a man right can look up to and respect ah
although the err macam at fate
manlier than I'm manlier than they are then macam like
what skills that do that they possess what skills do they possess right macam
that's really macam
macam that's really important
but they are not really that funny and then look at their target demographic ah their their target demographic right is macam
is err those macam budak err those macam budak-budak belum sunat gitu
then err macam they budak-budak belum sunat then
so macam I don't think so in a sense right
in a sense eh macam
dia orang nak test concept eh like concept of a show
oh iya lah
what you have to watch a show first then kalau kalau kau tak suka
ah eh who who are they like new faces ke orang lama tak ada like popular artistes
I don't know I used to I mean like my parents used to watch it all the time right suria so when they have the on kadang-kadang kalau ada show yang macam okay okay then I'll sit and watch ah but to be honest I cannot remember any any specific title
ah ya like it's just like macam background noise gitu
tapi macam I I mean the content okay kadang-kadang like the some documentaries there was one with um that girl dalila I don't know the girl with that cornrow hair
ah dalina dalina during bulan puasa ah bulan puasa macam kadang-kadang like sebelum buka then baru will watch
kalau tak macam err
oh my goodness mentang-mentang ada library eh kat situ dia orang dia orang dengki eh ya
kan aku dah lama seh tak pakai zoom call
oh ya jannah ya ya I can force jannah then kalau kalau aku berbual seorang
oh ya ah you have your but eh then where where is your sister dia tidur kat mana seh
nice eh tengok tengok tengok sikit
tu anjing eh
abeh apa oh lah horse ya allah
anjing eh eh cantik
cantik seh babe is that ros in the photo
oh ya ya betul betul betul
macam-macam lah kau mengarut
oh okay okay cause like right now there's a lot of discussion about kalau you dah age thirty you must have at least hundred K in your bank account that kind of thing
like a a a real high flyer then of course you can save a lot more lah cause right now a lot of like twenty five years old are saying oh I already saved fifty K then you no need to get married meh no need to buy ke you know ya then still spend money what
oh no then sekarang are you actually stress about the wedding or stress about all these things that you feel you're stress about or
aku ingatkan kau fikir banyak sangat ah
ya kalau kalau kalau bukan ros kalau robert kalau alah apa-apa jer lah sebab kau rasa macam robert you know would have the financial means
but the think is russell financial means are also above average jadi you know apa yang tak cukup ni sorry kau
is it dia
right but then cause of COVID and then they say oh people will are only gonna start flying in twenty twenty four then ya lah rasa takut tu mesti ada right sikit
oh okay okay okay that's nice so now your loan amount berapa
eh thirty three dengan hundred jauh beza seh
wah that is okay lah tak apa kau kau cepat-cepat collect then
ya two percent then tak apa lah just pay lah five hundred every month then after that you slowly accumulate your wealth back again and then you can invest the rest what cause you can always make your investment grow more than two percent so that's the logic behind it lah
mana dia nak cari masa nak do relief teaching on the side
ya tu pasal lah then banyak seh burden dia banyak burdens to bear
kesian hais I know
but like what could they possibly be bringing home eh dalam banyak-banyak itu baggage gitu
so so in the end flight tu delay ke tak
tak makan briyani
that macam dah naik muak dah twenty four hours alah apa lagi thosai
eh wait eh cannot hear you the hotel room itself like it's very rundown eh macam
ah okay lagi dekat sana eh

the nenek also was there the nenek lives there or something like that
mm plus eh tak payah tak payah tak tak
it's like apa tu what they say is it investment
like the higher rank one they they do that macam they they buy a condo because their pay is already high what so they they buy a condo
apa ni ya
I think they see also lah macam what kind of like background
family members support also you know macam like they like oh okay lah I got this amount like I
boleh tak start balik
okay I have a friend in in lah so macam they are they are brought up in a very err
ya so like macam
so like macam most of them um
they want to like go to like macam apa ni
so like macam wah like very interesting like they have they know that it's already like fixed you know
so I like wah so so lucky then like they like very chim know then like macam
susah sangat eh
ya if if they want if I mean like if they want to macam
work in a line where requires like or masters then okay lah but then I feel like macam
the type of work or like macam what you want to do
so it's like more of like macam
he was like uh telling me afiq actually kan um degree tak tak perlu sangat lah macam like if you want you want lah I mean like
huh my my senior ah my senior dia cakap actually at first also I want to take degree then bila fikir balik macam
um waste uh not not not say waste of time lah macam like you you need more money what to pay you school bills and all
apa tu enhance or like
like he can just like get in already because of the experience that he get macam like his
ya so first half is um local then macam I think around four months lah four months is overseas
so I got a double cert macam
like uh apa apa apa apa lah
in half a year and usually like that kind of thing take like macam a few years or like macam in one year ah
tunda lah kahwin ho then dapat anak dah empat puluh
chey sedih seh tu tak lah
no lah it won't this one ya tiga puluh
eh lelaki dengan perempuan masalah tau
ya eh really I mean like macam okay for for the girls eh
I mean like of course like we as guys like we want anak or what
then imagine kalau like you know that you can't um produce anak
then like it's another thing then you feel like macam
family tree ya ya zuriat wow
I wanted to say zakat zakat different thing sia
imagine if like your jodoh is like a older like for me eh a guy my jodoh is a older girl
or females is more like macam I feel that uh like girls kan macam like now the this like our generation kan
but I feel that now like macam they want to
unless ya unless your pay is like macam ada commission that kind
macam not
so that's why you need to have a back up ah macam like
satu ribu tu like for the longest time
ah then your the one that you saved up confirm [dah] makin lesser what
like a heads up eh macam now people start to think oh I need a like a back up plan I need savings that kind of thing
unless your company have like macam monthly pay cause uh ya cause like
um one of my friend uh apa ni
err dia kerja events so like monthly she got like a fixed pay of like two point five
uh apa ni she
um jobs ah macam like ada commissions so macam they give a lot of like commission things tau so she need to do a lot of like
so macam she will take in the other
uh person punya slot
so like okay let's say like macam you you already have a thing to do
then after that but still the commission will like the double commission tu will like
ya so so like macam it will add up lah it will add up to one commission in the end but then that commission can like
macam whatever they sell they will get like a few percent of it
gila kan
ya lah she untung lah
two no not cawangan err
so that this group will do some of this group punya work then this group will do like ya
crazy lah so macam like
ya but then of course the the shit that they go through like banyak masalah lah ya
ah sembarang ambil
uh got lah got but then um macam if you need to work
you really need to macam you need to put your work first like that
instead of like family of what which is the point like my friend macam
at a point of time she give up she wanted to like macam just um quit
so like macam
ya but you really need to stand for your right lah even though macam that pay is good ke apa kan but you must know your
so that the their apa ni the one that will take over them
ah dia orang punya anak will not have
so that macam like in like some people have like emergency money what
oh at that time uh they have a saving so they were sharing with me lah and my family macam they have a saving
uh okay their emergency is like so weird it's like macam okay emergency like wedding
like dia punya anak wedding
exactly macam okay like let's say macam
err last minute um the the anak couldn't pay for certain things kan
err then macam they need to help out in a way like that kind of like emergency lah
ah macam like those those small things macam like maybe uh venue
ah macam like
not it bukan bukan lupa bukan lupa but then she couldn't pay
because she's okay her ikat tunang
ah ah that one I don't know ah okay dia punya ikat tunang is two years
so I think she like macam want to get uh married lah already lah macam more earlier so they push like one year plus
then the mum was like think like saying are you sure I feel do you have like enough saving already then she say err nevermind lah buat simple simple
so like everything was like tergantung then the mum keep asking have you paid have you paid have you do this have you do that then she said oh ya ya ah later lah later lah then
but her side is already then she like macam
take it very lightly so I was like thinking kau nak kahwin ke tak nak kahwin ni kau serious ke tak serious ni
then I mean like if you want simple then just like nikah then makan sikit-sikit ah this one she do like a sanding sanding
then like got this and that I mean like macam okay the the quality is not as like
you know this girl ah she everything she tangguh tangguh tangguh then after that
cannot take it already the mum like there's no updates or anything then the mak ask her
then she like err ya actually ni nak kena bayar lagi berapa ribu gini then the mum like
then the mum the mak don't want to say like she got money to help
then her mum actually um help out lah in a way like macam a few percent of the
ya only like maybe like nikah lah
I think it's a that's what like every parents want nak ah ya because like even my mum also like
uh don't want lah we make uh some some somewhere that is like macam bigger ke apa lah
then like if more bigger means more money then she said err tak apa lah err I mean like
I can help you to help you like settle this or that then like of course my brother is like the first child so he don't want to like macam burden my mum
so but then my mum wants it so like macam
dia dilemma lah whether to do or not when she said then then the girlfriend um ya the girlfriend also like
said thinking like macam
uh tak apa lah kita buat simple simple you know gini gini but then like my mum want it to be like
um sempurna lah in a way looks good like people side
ya so like macam but the family is quite small
so okay so like macam not a lot from her side then from my brother side my brother really thought was like okay I will invite like less err he will be inviting like less than a thousand of people
macam maybe six hundred or five hundred depending on ya dah how many
know like macam
ya ya see kalau ada kemampuan lah I mean like ah ya then that ya then that's the that's one of the emergency money
and then like after that like macam maybe house or what
like macam
uh so that's why like macam
and plus like macam it depend how you
investment eh apa tu namanya um
like macam like you will get money if you
like insurance like that tapi you will get monthly money ah
no macam every month you pay something then after that you will receive um
ya tak
that's why I mean like definitely we want to adult with a clean way like macam a clean way of saving money or like getting investment kan
masing-masing ah eh masing-masing
kalau tak okay ah
dia dia curi daripada bapa dia then she give me I don't know then um err got caught lah got caught by the teacher teacher teacher cause we went to the next block only like this is the primary school the next block she saw because the staircase is like

not really stole lah he just left it out then he was drunk then I was like oh you know what if I take he's not going to know ya then err then my senior was like okay kalau kau hisap rokok kau ambil ah so sorry then um I came down lah we came down lah they give me then we smoke I was like wah hisap rokok tapi tak tarik tau then I was like err because this one is called tarik
if tak tarik is like you receive the smoke is more thicker
ya so that point of time I was like just like that lah I never like like that so they was like err and they were like um okay then they teach me lah how to tarik then I was like eh feels much better but I cough a lot lah
man apa ah err ya lah then they taught me how to smoke then we start to smoke smoke until I get to buy my own pack I tried my best twenty next year baru twenty one ya but now I still lepas lah but then ya
tak sometimes is your ya I think because of my body size that's why dia orang macam okay okay can can because I have the body of mak-mak punya orang macam last time last time but now I am like I I went back to skinny then I went back to like this now
and my thighs thighs memang susah nak hilangkan ah
takpe takpe exactly now with my father lah my father cakap eh kau ni gemuk apa lah semua tu that time I blast out at him like this is my body I'm your daughter you don't have to body shame me
no matter what exactly oh my god that is like damn offensive then everyone is like oh my god malunya then err that time I blast out at him lah like this is my body as my father you cannot just body shame me in front of others like
exactly and kau kurus pun is not in a healthy way so kau nak aku kurus apa ikut cara kau then is like oh my god I'm so frustrated then my father was like
like keep quiet ah dia macam serba salah gila then he minta maaf lah it's like bapa minta maaf ah I'm very sorry for what I said to you then sekarang dia start balik cause I want to take err license uh motor punya license so he at first ah dia memang tak kasi dia larang dia larang gila babi then I ask from my mum my mum kasi then I told my dad lah like asal mama boleh kasi bapa tak boleh kasi then he
he was like huh mama kau kasi kau permission cause my mum and dad cerai so bila nak dapat decision memang susah gila ah then err apa ah then my dad said okay fine kalau kau betul-betul nak ambil lesen kau kuruskan badan kau dulu then I was like you know what okay asalkan dia kasi me that macam only way
macam okay kau nak aku kurus fine I do anyways lah like any way that I can do like tak makan ke apa anything but last time I never eat for almost two months I was damn thin that's why I say when last time I err I was not fat
biscuits that's all ya light snacks only ya lah if that's the only way he can let me take license right you know what I'm just gonna do it not just not to eat lah I mean like just be skinny for him to macam okay fine kau dah boleh ambil lesen
why not mm look look at your friends your friends all poly right I'm still like those macam you know so I like motor since young cause I grow up with my aunty what then her anak
is a the first the first child was a guy so I look up to him as I grew up lah and then the motor ya he ya I'm the only child ya then dia ada motor he is very successful lah like alhamdulillah dia successful then dia pun dah kahwin then bini pun
anak pun dah dua macam okay lah you know what I'm just gonna be like him lah he he is a major in err I think major sergeant ah I don't know in in his army ya cause he signed on ya
that one is navy navy lagi susah malay navy lagi susah
oh okay err oh shit about the army oh my god so now I I want to be a I want to join in the army also as a female yeah I want to go to all guys there yang perempuan ni actually boleh buat semua macam gitu
I know how to self-defence like siapa-siapa nak pegang kan try me like seriously I learn a lot how to self-defence with guys lah cause dah banyak kali kita dah take advantage but then I learn how to be stronger lah belajar belajar belajar belajar pang satu kali ni this guy ah dia nak try one time shoot he run away he was like like
like legit no one talk to me anymore because he is the one yang nak ambil advantage punya he he tried to macam nak pegang-pegang tu semua then I was like bro we are just friends bro then you are touching me this way then he was like can lah can lah terus I give up like okay kau fikir perempuan ni apa lemah sangat apa I give him one punch at his face because I was
that one I don't care lah like I just it's better to be safe than sorry no matter what he's gonna do to me ke buang uh me from the army or whatever it is right as long as I'm safe because I can just make a report sue him let him know what he have he has done lah and dia pangkat sergeant and is a very high rank already for for like the sergeant punya rank lah so if he if he if once the big boss already know about what the
the sergeant did buang so whatever he did to me he will get back lah ya
I don't know the way that is not like err being like disrespectful disrespecting lah I'm just like you know if he's like my father but in a very bigger way like he's got like he's our dad lah kirakan cause he's the one that create us what so is like one way to do it is like if this is how comfortable I am with allah like this is how peace he make me feel like when I'm talking to him praying to him you know so is like bukan macam eh lu macam muak no
that's exactly ya that is like ya allah tolong lah jangan lah buat macam gini you know like please lah please lah at least that one he knows macam because he already know what are we gonna say what are we gonna do so if he knows that I'm gonna disrespect him he knows what he is gonna do to me like you know macam like berbual maki ya allah you know that
and as people also don't understand you doesn't mean those hijab people that you don't understand you must like be against them example we are not okay with okay ah macam you are a french person okay and you don't like me because I wear hijab and I don't like you because you are very ignorant am I like why are you so ignorant blah blah blah no right like I'm leaving you alone because like you do you I do me like like that
same sama ya true true
ya ya ya and not saying that we are that good we are not that perfect memang betul kita semua bukan perfect pun
so is like something is even orang yang very bias also they do mistakes maybe not now then or in the future so is like we don't even know what we are gonna do sometimes kita fikir macam kita buat benda semua macam oh wow kita aku rasa aku betul ah tapi orang lain tengok macam eh actually dia ni apa sia dia buat a'ah sia salah sia padahal sendiri fikir macam oh baik baik baik
tapi nanti bila dah live a long life already fikir balik macam like oh my god what the hell man what is this like what did I do like something like that lah like so sekarang for the mak and minah I feel sorry for them ah because they maybe tak dia kurang ajar
pasal dia orang betul-betul kurang ajar so ya I have this okay so people keep saying that I'm a minah and I'm very against it because do you even know what's a minah
I can be a minah I can be a mat I can be a guy I can be a girl I can be bias I can be not you know but then is like that's my life and people keep judging me for that is like okay this is my life not yours and allah give me this life is not for you to judge and not for me to macam you know like judge people or for you to judge me
but maybe their way of saying ya and sometimes kita tak macam we never K like sometime when we are angry we say things different we thought is like just saying you know but people is like why are you so mad like why you so harsh but padahal macam pada kita is like I'm just saying the facts and if
the facts you cannot really accept it then what else can you accept you expect us to macam sugarcoat everything macam oh wow you are doing so great eh takpe ah kau pakai hijab tak tutup err apa apa ni leher takpe lah lupa melayu sikit takpe ah kau tak tutup pun takpe eh takpe ah tak pakai tudung ah kau pakai tudung dengan sleeveless pun tak apa eh kau nak main bola pakai tudung
never heard of that but ya like semalam dah cakap ah it's like okay that kind of teguran is like you are stupid and you like to sugarcoat everyone what are you trying to get is like wow
eh example like macam wah farah so nice ah she everytime sugarcoat me ya but padahal farah itself is like
exactly uh like seriously I feel so malu terhadap melayu-melayu kita sendiri
eh oh my god kalau tak jadi riak pun allah tak terima sia so allah sendiri dah tahu apa kau tengah buat dia dah tahu apa kau akan buat so the more you share to people macam eh kau tahu tak aku solat sia eh lima waktu sia
okay then what you want me to do macam oh wow you confirm go to heaven lah what you expect exactly so is like oh my god
ya then is like okay firstly is like you really recite quran ah a lot of time macam anda khatam tu semua kau tak payah ingat macam eh kau dah khatam belum like aku dah khatam sia
I'm like okay you can at least say like macam okay kalau if your friends like haven't khatam and you have already khatam like at least two times three times you can just ajar that person macam okay lah aku tolong kau lah aku bimbing ah apa aku akan jadi your guide lah
guidance okay so kau dapat pahala kau tak payah riak macam K lah aku jadi cikgu engkau lah aku dah khatam banyak kali like you don't have to say that macam okay lah
like for example I haven't khatam you already khatam then I'm like I really want to khatam because I want to be closer to god I want to really understand it I want to finish it I want tears of um like tears of joy you know at least
and ya sadness because ya then farah came up to me like example lah macam uh do you need help like kau belum khatam kan sebab aku baru khatam so kau perlukan bantuan tak at least you are offering in that kind of way and that kind of tone is very nice and for me is like
you are not judging me in any ways you know it feels like you are really you really want to help me I was like okay ah boleh tolong tak
macam you know you can just say it that way but why must you like so ya exactly so is like oh my god like memalukan gila lah serius serius like tuduh ke
oh my god anda tak faham tu jer boleh cakap
mmhmm ya then is like okay lah if you want to be jealous because of a good thing is is actually good ah actually macam tak bersalah is not meant to be judge
alamak aku dah baca quran dah berapa tahun tapi dia baru dua dua bulan dah habis dah khatam macam
ya exactly I was like eh bukan ke tadi kita berbual pasal motor um sports bikes or street bikes
mm wow first hand for first hand lah at least for first hand lah for class two B cause err every rider need to start at two B then baru two A then two so for two B motors for sports bike lah ada yang ten K ten K first hand

like suddenly a lot of people main layla sia then after that like I don't know she got stronger
so macam layla
eudora eudora eudora pun sama
then siapa lagi
ya a lot of like older older players ah they revamp then macam nowadays
a lot more punya yang we don't use last time macam layla
enam puluh dollar on the game I have no words I am

let's start playing again ah cause like aku pun nak try naik balik tau cause aku drop sampai like aku from mythic sia mythic you know abeh aku drop so it's like
the fact that okay okay asal kan asal kan kau bahagia ah eh asal kan kau bahagia
I don't think they revamp karina cause macam I don't see a lot of people playing karina so but you can always try then mana tahu kau dah baca kau punya itu build builds semua kan mana tahu kau boleh jadi pro karina so ya and ya it's not as toxic surprisingly lah aku tak tahu asal which is weird lah cause normally kalau cause I always play mage dengan support right then I whenever aku play ah I aku punya sekarang pretty bad ah like noob lah noob so bila
noob ah and ada slurs so macam
nowadays they don't like last time they they ada lah they got say
all the mean words but now they don't eh surprisingly so macam
eh kirakan kau natural born gamer lah ini oh my god

actually apa lagi eh nak cakap
so kirakan kau just take advantage of this the rank lah ini
suka eh mentang-mentang dia dapat asyik asyik menang jer dapat increase kau punya wing rate and everything err

then like dia macam dragon gitu super cool
dia punya actually I've tried before lah and
aku tak bagus ah aku tak boleh main fighter apa aku jadi fighter macam macam
like real seh everytime aku jadi fighter kan confirm confirm aku mati banyak so it's like a no no but ya that dragon is pretty good macam dia punya ulti kan you basically become dragon
okay lah I don't know what's the term lah cause I'm not as nerd as you but um jadi dragon then right nanti okay dia actually kecil tau dia punya character tak besar sangat then bila dia lepas jadi dragon dia dah collect macam don't know what is it called I forgot apa five whatever it's called
then um meet gordon besar sia dah macam
dah macam besar lah besar ya but I think ya you should play you should play that one or
I mean kau pernah main apa and it's when you play freya bagus lah
so macam maybe at that point of time the the the the the the player wasn't as good lah weren't as good but I think if kalau kau
kalau kau just keep on go kan and main more games and practise right confirm kau boleh jadi top sia hear already knowing how nerd you are
then dia punya balmond bagus sia
legit legit super thick like macam susah nak susah nak bunuh dia
and dia pandai main dia tak macam kau macam dia punya ulti kan dia tak hit minion
dia dia tau pandai nak hit so macam I get I get it but it's okay I know baby steps baby steps
actually tank right I think kau pakai hilda atau masha is good lah I mean ya we've talked about it hilda atau masha
aku kalau aku kalau fighter atau tank tak boleh
cause like aku tak I'm not the kind to step up lah aku aku tiada pendirian lah sia
paksa kan nampak

ada dekat-dekat ada andes lah ada kan
so should be fine lah and nasi-nasi itu semua where got time for nasi we go western
wait no just kidding I need my nasi I am
I need my nasi
okay tak sangat lah
kita tak cakap pasal staycay seh kita just cakap pasal
ah penat
apa seh but
eh no okay actually we meet we've been planning to meet so many times but selalu it's either macam dia penat satu penat satu malas atau just macam
wrong timing lah everytime aku ajak
so macam okay lor
but we are fine with hanging out together lah kau step jer mana kau punya glue glue alamak kita boleh hang out sendiri lah chey just kidding
so just lepak lah basically eh but but we wanted to go trampoline kan so it's like
kita rest on the first day then second day we just go trampoline all the way so we go morning you want to go gym then after that
I was like eh abeh korang pergi gym dah lah gym boleh dua orang jer abeh aku
so macam I boleh lah korang nak pergi gym pergi lah but then maybe aku just I don't know go for a run but
aku tak tahu that area okay I am not very familiar
container dia pun bukannya besar sangat kan
okay never mind we just make do with what we can okay on that day so we just see how it goes because I aku pun tak nak I just don't want you guys to macam
you know like I don't want you guys to in the morning leceh have to go for gym also I mean it's quite tiring right if we sleep then in the morning I mean it's refreshing in the morning lah of course but
right we're going to cook breakfast right then we cook breakfast then we mandi eh we mandi first then we cook breakfast
container macam you already bought the container mah
bought eh as in like I don't know lah aku macam nak stay in the container
the other end is dhoby ghaut right eh salah
okay what quite dekat what actually
so that's the first plan the second option is the one yang itu lah yang
cause from trampoline park right we'll be sweaty already if we want to go other place aku takut
I mean even if we tukar baju and everything we still busuk mah like we still feel very icky and sticky
bro oh my god okay if that's the case then kita punya our breakfast we just eat mcdonald's lor you can lah can lah not not so eh okay what mcdonald's one of the days
hey the what a hater I mean come on sponge isn't supposed to masak also you know come on now
oh sorry I don't go there I don't know about all this stuff because macam macam I see what's in front of me so my little pony is cute like that is cute like that there's nothing go behind it unless you really go make your reason
sudah eh
adalah kaedah get in the workers are you get everyday
kuih suji is smelly shouldn't be smelly what should be flour you know
and I think that's why I I I went back to the first mask cause uh it's just a lot clearer and less heavy on the face as well cause I think the second one is quite like ya it fit's nicely what but at the same time it's quite like berat it's just so heavy and
like really tak kisah like the people and that's where the the people always lose out yes your business is thriving you are in the top number one in the world whatever whatever it's like your business and all that is thriving and all that you're earning billions got a lot of reserve and
you the minah that's very bising
why would I wash my selimut
I think kita boleh start sekarang
tak macam pelik eh buat benda macam gini
you said that you nak berbual pasal
rumah baru kan
okay so rumah baru tu I was thinking
ah initially kan saya nak buat yang
colour kelabu tu kan yang colour grey
entah eh kadang-kadang saya pasal that time saya tengok Pinterest then lepastu
ah apa tu
saya nampak dorang buat macam this deep green punya colour dia macam
royal green punya colour
ada dia macam deep very
dia macam not dark green tau dia macam
emerald green gitu
okay you see this ni kan light kan dia macam something like this
no this one this one yang hujung ni
but it's not very dark what dia macam okay okay jer
so I thought that colour untuk kita punya apa tu
kat mana hall
dalam bilik feature wall kat mana seh
but then our apa err headboard for the bed kan nanti cover feature wall you cover half already what
on top then might as well you taruk frame
entah apa-apa painting ah yang cantik-cantik ke you go and buy kat Spotlight ke
ya habis siapa nak paint
no lah tak jatuh punya lah
okay I ada this idea tau one
okay okay I won't say one room but one wall you know the hallway yang ah okay sekarang it's
right then lepastu ada macam this narrow pathway
ah that pathway kan ada one wall
ah that wall yang now is the study table punya corner yang taruk printer
because sana kan ada um
dia macam ada mini table
and then bawah dia is all drawers
remember makcik tu buat
and then I want to fill up that wall with frames like small small A four-sized ataupun A five-sized frames
so if if it's a walkway I tak nak
no dining table is still kat ni pe uh entrance
sebab apa tau the
if you put raised floor dekat depan entrance
exactly orang dari orang dari luar boleh nampak and then the people sitting at the raised floor can't really see the
so then macam
okay so kat sini is one area
is macam an area of its own
then macam you don't want to talk across like that
so might as well leave it as dining area ah because anyway it's nearer to the dapur what then once you masak-masak kat dapur then you just keluar kan then it's sebelah jer
tak payah nak bulky bulky punya dining table
ah because right now dia punya dining table bulky gila
ye lah ye lah lepastu
dia punya tingkap area is the triangle one kan yang ada bucu kan
ah can ah yang itu yang bucu nya area kita buat raised floor
so at least dorang ada seating area kat situ then you can put you can put books lah or whatever you can put your playstation kat sana if you want to play games
then you don't need to semak kan the living room
because you kalau dah main start main game cam playstation kat
but workstation if kat triangular punya bucu I don't think it work because dia banyak pakai space
and dia punya space tak ah
okay so you can easily duduk lah
almari yang in-built tu
oh ya cakap pasal swing
if we install a swing that mount daripada ceiling
over the years kan nanti ceiling tu macam crack tau
cam combine weight lah
nanti ceiling tu macam crack tau
dalam house seram hor
saya macam banyak imagination kalau swing gitu
nanti macam ye lah awak kerja malam
then saya sorang sorang kat rumah
which we we want to buy also what you want to buy weights I want to buy the cardio punya machine
no seh I malas nak pakai tudung jogging kat luar
tak nak ah swing macam
seram pula nanti malam-malam alone
living room saya nak gi toilet dapur asyik nampak jer benda alah tu
actually the I want to put on the wall I want to mount on the wall because dia save space and it looks neater
kita baru move in what
why do you want to alih-alih kan
why you want to alih
if you take it down then you you you jalan wire right and then you just move the mount lah you screw it to some other wall that you want
then the screw hole yang kat lama punya wall you just paste it lah you cover
ah okay faham
but let's say you want to alih you want to alih where where you want to move it
then after that is already the wooden punya punya fake wall
ah tukar mood ah
but then that means you won't have your feature wall macam rumah shah lah
because rumah shah is already permanent like that because he go and buy the big big feature wall
then jalan wire kat belakang lah berlampu lah apa semua all the lights all the lights
but if you want but if you put on top of console why you want to tampal
let's say you want to move it depan tingkap
then the lights shines at the tingkap
we don't pasang first
tu nanti boleh kita tengok macam mana kita nak ubahsuai bilik tu that living room
and then we decide if really want to because light anytime you can pasang what
ah so that one we nanti nanti dulu ah
tapi saya saya tak nak rumah tu too fancy fancy you know what I want it minimalistic and clean and like one solid colour or maybe okay or maybe one one colour and then maybe two shades that's it two shades of the same colour let's say if I choose grey light and medium grey
I don't want macam blue white orange green I don't want I don't want
you want the house to look like one karaoke punya tempat ah
but it's but it's macam pening macam I don't want to come home to that kind of house
yes yes betul tapi we can do that tapi we play with shades we don't play with colour you tahu okay I want the house to look very hotel hotel ish macam atas atas hotel so you see atas atas hotel they use very minimalistic colour
okay and they play with shades and dorang punya furniture is
either if you want to choose wood then it's all macam classic wood if you want to choose metal they won't choose the heavy heavy kind of metal they choose macam ah simple ah structure metal
so it looks very macam nice and clean and comfortable tau and very fresh you don't get sick and tired of it because you're going to stay there for years
and then we can make it gradient that means atas light colour like the same green light colour light green lepastu pelan pelan medium lepastu pelan pelan dark green
if you want to buat macam a bit fancy
ah tapi gradient ada leceh sikit nak buat ah
that one tak salah you have to use sponge then macam
ah so leceh ah
so macam compared to your time spend
paint the entire house you nak paint gradient macam gitu so about the same tapi dapat paint satu bilik jer
and then you have to buy tiga cat
because you nak gradient kan you kena beli tiga tiga shades of cat ah
solid grey let's say grey ah solid one colour one shade then you just buy one big tub of cat
let's say ah let's say you tak nak buat gradient
tahu lah I know
I'm just comparing the ni
berapa litre ah paling besar
lima litre ada lapan litre
yang bangladesh pakai kan
one big tub yang I pernah beli
oh ya cakap pasal brand
ah tadi I nampak satu advertisement and then uh apa tu
I don't know what technology dorang pakai
tak serious serious macam okay macam for example Nippon Paint cakap dia punya paint is odour-free
odourless and also ah kalau apa-apa conteng conteng you can wipe it off
tak I don't know but ya
I know tapi that's how they advertise ah so
they said that the paint purifies the paint purifies the air in your house then macam wah cool lah
tapi I rasa Nippon Paint should be okay lah enough lah Nippon Paint pun everyone use also okay lah
then the the one yang boleh lap ah kalau
err see if kita nak oil paint ataupun the
kan dua
kan ada dua dua type ya
got two types of paint satu is ah
cat minyak lagi satu is cat apa entah cat kapur ah cat kapur
tapi berkilat seh nanti
the finish is berkilat
is this one this one is kapur
ah oil-based is berkilat is like how ah
it's like okay sometimes you know void deck dia punya pillars tengah tengah dia macam ada pattern pattern then it's berkilat
kalau terkena baju ke terkena apa you buang
you buang sudah tu baju
bukan susah nak hilang tak boleh hilang pun jangan harap mm
ah tu ah
then awak masih nak yang
painting painting ayat tu
tak ah
I'm not saying I'm not saying that we gantung atas ah headboard kat katil
kat ni lah apa tu living room ke kat dining room area ke
if you want ayat-ayat then okay lah put lah but frame
no no you go you go to arab street got this one uh kedai dia punya ayat cara dia buat is so modern tau
cantik gila serious serious cantik gila
no but dia punya dorang macam buat three D printing punya tau of the of the tulisan
it's not old school rumah pakcik kind serious
it's not rumah rumah pakcik makcik punya
paste on wall looks like sekolah madrasah seh
you paste on the wall then macam dia macam mengotorkan
okay unless you can show me the kind of paste dekat wall that I am going to like
ya lah that's why I tell you I don't know which one I like because to me tak lawa
because you want to paste it besar besar dekat living room that one macam
apa uh you find me stickers ayat yang pada you cantik
no lah ayat from al-quran ah
ah kalau words of wisdom might as well I take the A B C english one atau malay one
so you find me a ayat
yang paste on yang pada you cantik yang you berkenan
you you pilih
bila masuk rumah kan ada satu tembok
oh tu tak boleh buat apa-apa eh tembok tu
tapi tu nanti nanti ah
sekarang jer store dia dah kecil
the the pakcik kecil kan store what actually the store is big what
mm the the dining table bulky seh like bulky gila punya kes makcik-makcik punya style
I don't want to put it inside a room ah then macam one whole pile kat tepi tu
kita nanti nanti dulu ah
nanti nanti dulu because tu pun renovation seh
a'ah so still akan berabuk juga ah
it's just a fake wall and then a few macam ah apa tu
ah rak-rak
mmhmm a few rak-rak then okay already ah
and pintu okay lah oh ya ah I just realised rumah makcik tu tak ada bomb shelter
and then the our new house mana ada first floor
dia start from second floor what
mm boleh jer
but I think better if orang solat dekat inside the second bedroom ah because if they solat dekat the first bedroom then let's say we have our laptops
kita ada our documents
and then some more if I then some more if I bring in yang tu ah apa tu
exercise nya machine
ah there more comfortable I think more comfortable ask them to solat dekat the second bedroom because we are going to put in this kind of carpet remember
bilik amni looks kecil sebab katil dia besar
you got see before or not single bed then bawah dia boleh pull out
dengar lah dengar
awak punya idea of walk-in
kita ada this macam very short pathway kan actually short pathway tu tak ada
pasal makcik tu dia naik kan wadrobe tu nampak macam short pathway actually it's just a huge square room that's all
macam this dua pintu so you tambah lagi satu pintu ah
and then tempat saya bersiap my
because my tempat siap is tengah tengah what so if I getting ready in the middle abeh you want to walk where got space
because your baju there what
actually kan saya tak suka bersiap duduk tau
I like to stand and siap
I thought it's with a chair and then macam
ah faham
just to taruk my barang barang makeup right
actually I don't want cermin
I don't like that kind of cermin I like this kind of cermin yang you can go up close
no I don't want to sit down I won't ever sit down when I'm tengah bersolek
mm laci lah laci kecil
can ah then the laci I can put my tudung and then kat atas tu macam I buy the transparent plastic rak-rak then put lipstick lah ke apa semua
most most probably berselerak
dia tak selerak bila apa tau macam the first few days that I kemas
nanti dah after the first week terus dah macam berterabur macam ribut taufan kat situ
orh side of the bed ya you sebelah tingkap ah
mm mm side side siapa panggil side side bed
mm tutup belum
because I was thinking if ada enough space eh if
couch kat kat kaki katil
you know okay when you go hotel hotel kadang-kadang dorang ada small couch kat depan katil
that's where you sit down drink kopi or you want chit-chat but you don't want to be on the bed you want to sit down
kat wall lah
gantung kat ceiling a bit ugly you know
tak nak ah nanti jatuh kena kepala
orh rak eh
one simple rak
then after that kita taruk projector kat situ ah
ah then can taruk frames also
then macam it brightens up the room
it does dia macam you have so many memories then you can frame it up
cantik what
because it's very personalised so macam okay for example you go travelling and then you beli painting or something and then you come back to singapore then you buy a frame then you nicely frame so macam it means something to you
maybe orang luar yang datang visiting tak tahu lah but you know what
because you are the owner of the house so you macam okay aku tahu aku beli painting ni dari mana and then uh okay this picture was me and you from where we go
because okay kebanyakkan orang kumpul this benda-benda sentimental lepastu they chuck it one side or they put it in the box they put it in the album then they never look at it
dia macam not very useful lah
eh don't want ah ugly ah tampal tampal tampal gitu
dah macam bilik budak
dah macam apa teenagers teenagers punya bilik
wow I'll be your age sekarang
tapi you dah empat puluh
imagine boleh imagine tak
awak dah empat puluh you'll be celebrating your four zero
hello and then bila you celebrate your four zero birthday birthday I belum sampai I masih tiga puluh tiga
as long as I dapat feature wall yang ada frame
syukur you know syukur
can kita dah cakap
stop sekejap jantung
benda yang kita kena siap kan dalam masa yang terdekat eh
seh dalam masa yang terdekat
bahas twenty twenty featuring nursalihati
okay kita kena beli barang-barang untuk bersihkan okay do you still want to hire people to sanitise the house
you want to find murah how murah kita five room tau sayang
five room you nak sanitise tu toilet lagi

dia nak charge sama rumah
yes sayang kita five room
okay yes sayang kita five room tetapi kita five room bukan five room tau
kita nya five room besar tau sayang
then they want to cakap the price bopian ah dorang dah sampai pe

wait wait wait so he pinjam duit
ah dia put afan name down as macam guarantor kau tahu kind of thing ah
but did he tell him beforehand ke apa
so how long ago was this and berapa
dia punya amount
wait but kinda guy macam like can't he go to a licensed one
but you are initially macam kau okay with that ah actually
dia macam degil kind of guy ya
tak macam masalah dia it is that kind of thinking like
nanti your issues will like snowball
snowball anjing punya
pinjam duit shit
making macam
co-curricular activities kau tahu
but aku aku macam thinking more of on the lines of
macam you ask me to get a guard
macam eh eh eh bodoh you know that kind of thing
kau jangan get rile up ah
okay so the other day aku jumpa dia
oh it's one of those kind I like like like um on the video kadang-kadang
they would ah play macam
okay so dia cakap macam
kalau aku hilmi
then ah he wafan was saying ya but you know the act of macam more or less you're saying
I was wondering kalau
matair jer
so that's the thing I was trying to get across to him ah macam you know I understand where he's coming from sebab
help help that's a fucking understatement kan ya but macam
in a in a very tough spot aku macam put it in a more personal light ah I'm saying that I totally not okay
like would you still hang out with me tak
and then macam cakap
probably also he had a pause cause someone was trying to cut into his lane then dia macam maki sekejap ah
abeh he said that he said that ultimate like pakcik thing to say that ah that was like
no no no no that's one thing that's this one pakcik thing but he said the other part pakcik thing
nanti aku tak boleh focus
okay after awhile then he he told me that okay I I would still hang out with you aku masih boleh
lepak dengan kau ah kind of thing
aku macam okay
let's say kau nak main macam devil's advocate kind of thing
so what do you feel about the difference macam in terms of
okay but what do you think of her macam dia punya character and such
okay so I what I don't see where you're coming from ah macam aku faham but I don't think it's matter of gender tau
bodoh gila pe
sama sama situation as us ah
bulgy chonkers juga tau
dia punya their food
kan dorang punya makanan
the portion kan besar gila
tapi there's no incentive too you know
but that one also doesn't paint like err macam compete picture juga cause a lot of the citizens dorang punya baseline is met
okay uh as a brown guy here aku pun free education ah up to a point
we get sidetrack macam anjing
other factors juga
err apa nama dia
so what is it about the home wrecker yang
punya urge to choke slam dia is like rising ah it's
like the underlying issue is still there apa like he's basically not happy
it's a dengki thing ah
but if you see me tons of time aku mana iron anything
no but it's one of those things that it just macam it creeps up on you
sebab ah asian dengan
wait wait ah kau sixty one right
kind of situation aku macam I was eighty six kilo sia
aku used to have an issue about eating ah I don't why like I I was constantly lapar like hungry
but you eat you wake up in the morning kira kan macam
ravenous nak mampus
so macam um I think they were doing like is
macam no no no
aku dah macam yo
is it dah macam you know like
no it's not so much muz ah muz macam
so he was first I said okay but it was that kind of okay macam
suka hati ah you know that kind of thing
ah kind of ya so my sister was complaining a bit and then after that he was finding a a lot of issues pasal
aku pun nak join his side but I cannot
but there got a lot of things that he brings up also are things that you know I've I've um contemplated about lah some of them macam not a big deal but there are some things that he that as I find it to be surprising that he takes issue with one thing is zakat
dia macam cakap oh it doesn't feel transparent
betul ah that's what fahim adhere
no not my family dinner at simpang kan
ah aku dah
aku dengar tu aku dah macam oo
roma dah stand at attention
so I kau jangan cakap gini ah
macam you cannot expect a marriage now what doesn't make sense right
just the show juga
oh he ajak me again like today's friday but aku macam
oh no no aku have
no it's one of those like coursera kind of shit kau tahu
this makes sense aku aku faham
australia eh tak
and we been friends for berapa tahun
dari twenty fifteen
tu twenty fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen
did you know they say kalau apa ni you been friends for tujuh tahun lebih kan then it's a friend for life so in this one year that's the defining
and that's like nanti we we buat apa ni
macam buat form konon eh aku kasi kau ah nadi you have to sign this form for making sure friends for life
so lagi satu tahun ah
banyak commitment
okay ah jom kita tengok
hmm macam
pada I semua makanan sedap so semua memorable
um kalau satu eh
terduduk right or like if I makan curry cause I tak suka sangat tau makan curry right so kalau makan curry right then confirm sometimes I will think about the bunny chow ah macam mengidam
basically curry dalam roti satu bantal roti sebantal roti
and then curry kat dalam
ya I know I cause like kita order kita nampak gambar tu that's why kita order kan
so tapi macam I think yang kenapa like
tempat the tempat itself
like orang-orang dia semua macam
chill right like dorang nampak kita macam kawan baik padahal tak pernah jumpa and then I think cause also not a lot of people cause it wasn't a meal time
tempat orang tourist kan
terus tak ada orang then kita jer
food adventure day so macam
kita makan tu lepas tu kita gi makan was it a burger
cause also we had no money but kita nak makan banyak
ya nak kena agak-agak
agak-agak lah
oh aku ingat seh aku ingat McDonald's
I remember the McDonald's pasal
aku saja jer keluarkan chili packet um
I ada gambar I think
satu benda tu macam ah roti dalam dia daging
it's like roti prata dalam gulung gulung daging
kari daging or something like that is it
oh ada nasi
macam nasi briyani tapi tu tengah tengah dia cheese eh apa eh
cheese dengan daging ah
ah tu nasi
daging dengan cheese ke something lah putih there right it was a
ya then cause melayu dorang bukan macam melayu kita ah cause their malay is mainly they came from indonesia ya and then
oh I aku tahu err there's something else kita cuba um apa benda tu yang roti
itu jer eh roti yang is also from the malay apa the melayu the cake malay site no remember we went driving like I think on my birthday or something we went driving in that area
so that no it wasn't bo-kaap it was like a different side of cape town and then we drove there specifically for that particular roti
what was the roti called
okay so the roti is like ah roti perancis panjang gitu kan and then after that dia potong setengah lepas tu dia taruk macam you nak taruk daging ke nak taruk ayam
ya but it's like a very very long roti perancis right
sayur right and vegetable
ya then we no we then okay so we had the whole roti perancis and then they asked us whether you want the full you know like Subway like foot long or half right and then we were like ya we want full and then so he was okay so you want two
ah terus kita nak masuk kan ice box pun tak berani
tu lepas tu tak ada microwave
so kita macam
nak buat apa ni eh so I remember satu satu malam kita tinggalkan kat tepi kat atas meja betul tak
uh it was like I think we ate like like for lunch and dinner on that day we ate only half of that roti perancis betul tak
and then the next then the next roti perancis
front that roti we even half it again right so it was like one quarter so we ate the one quarter then the one quarter and another one quarter so it's like four four four meals ya but I think
no it's ya sedap
then the other day I tengok then there's I think someone was also at
the freaking roti perancis
um was we wanted to go to the hill remember kita there was like
hari kedua kan kita dah sampai okay so we sampai kat cape town then we already checked in and everything then the next day
so kita lah macam ghairah kan konon banyak tenaga so kita orang macam okay the next day ya
masih muda that was how many three years ago only
so like the next day we were like okay even though we're jet-lagged kita nak pergi we know tak nak buang masa kita nak terus like jump into all the activities right
so kita pergi
and then the Grab driver was like very nice very friendly talk to us the entire trip okay this was at five or six in the morning can you imagine like we lepas just after we got off and then
ya and then the Grab driver okay so the plan was kita nak panjat itu hill and then after that at the top of the hill then we see the sunrise
right it makes so much sense and people say like to go up the hill it takes like you know half an hour at most so kita macam okay ah boleh ah settle juga ah kan so the then the Grab driver very nice what was his name ah I remember it was something very doug
betul it's like no doug or something doug lah his name I don't know and then and then ya I remember we made a lot of jokes after that no okay anyway so
so the so we told him that we wanted to climb nak tengok sunrise all that and he then he dropped us off at this spot and he said ya a lot of people panjat kat situ they start kat situ then they panjat and then by the time dorang kat atas nampak sunrise so kita macam eh it doesn't look like
the hill or whatever and there's like signs that say climbing blah blah blah so kita okay lah go jer so so kita tak tak pakai benda climbing pun kita pakai jeans kan kita pakai winter coat uh you I remember you were having like the bomber jacket and then we started climbing
tak bersedia langsung we just started and then air pun tak ada I remember
botol air kita ada satu jer botol air right between us there's satu botol air
kasut biasa and then kita ada makanan kita ada aku tahu aku ada bawa gula-gula
you know Daim kan yang chocolate gula-gula something like that
I think there's like berapa gula-gula jer and then after that ya satu botol air okay so we started climbing then masih boleh sempat vlog tau mana video tu pun aku tak tahu pergi
then kita panjat
kita panjat terus dah macam lima belas minit ke dua puluh minit macam masih belum naik eh belum lagi sampai a'ah so kita macam kenapa kenapa macam jauh betul ni ingatkan like all the online say like it's very fast should be okay and then like okay ah
ah puncak dia macam jauh kan
I don't know lah kita dah sampai
go jer ah ikut jer takkan nak stop
a'ah eh tak jauh ah
terus dah dah setengah jam gitu aku ingat kita dua macam dah penat kan terus ada kat ada macam tempat duduk kan then ada bench
then it was like facing the apa the town below so kita macam wah cantik kita pun duduk then kita duduk then kita macam penat terus minum air ah then kita minum air wah macam relax ah konon terus minum air
then by that time also sunrise pun dah naik terus kan kita macam okay don't need see sunrise ah but never mind ah
ya and then I remember kita share gula-gula
apa ni minum air lepas tu dah okay dah nak can continue okay jom continue lagi
continue berapa jam ah dua jam tiga jam dua jam
aku rasa dua jam continue all the way to the top
like seriously siapa panjat all the way tak perasan macam oh go jer
like macam jap jap dah sampai atas gunung
tak like waktu kita tengah panjat pun macam angin dia terlalu kuat kan then the angin
naik kan
ah macam angin dia tengah tolak kita naik so I think that's why kita macam every time kita pass by that part kita macam cepat-cepat naik kan macam go go go go
ya so turns out the hill was like so why the mountain was called lion's head is cause the lion the mountain the the the head it was actually the kepala and then there's signal hill that we wanted to originally to climb was actually the body of this lion
so kita
but the Grab driver didn't see that kita tak pakai baju athletic at all oh okay kita pakai baju lepak nak mampus
oh I remember after when we were going down kan aleh-aleh ada ramai orang naik betul tak so dorang semua tengok kita orang macam kenapa dorang pakai baju macam gini
dengan beg sekolah dengan coat warna biru aku ingat seh coat aku biru macam shiny
your bomber jacket like bright pink bright blue so macam I really going down the mountain like wearing casual clothes and then these mountain people
ya macam
tak puas kan
we all melayu together
you talk all the masjid-masjid
all the masjid
kita ikut macam ada walking tour kan tapi tu kita tak halfway kita macam
kira was cape town itself and then when we went for that safari after the school
the safari so we had so basically lepas kita dah
ya it felt so long right ya like hari-hari ada benda nak buat
weekend kita orang pergi mana
pergi entah lah sekolah bawa gi jalan-jalan kat mana it's like literally weekend trip to a different part of
it was it was very bulgy I think also cause majority of the budak-budak yang ada were budak apa american so like I think they had to up like they wanted to make sure these americans tak complain sangat confirm dorang complain ya
ya so for that after kita dah belajar for the summer programme then we had like this one week plus of safari so kita orang pergi um basically we went up the coast of southern south africa
and then kita ya basically went and look at all
we saw we saw them but like kat reserve like we had to enter a reserve to look at all the wild animals and it's not like a zoo where you know where they are cause you is if you're lucky then you get to see if you're not lucky then you don't get to see
oh there was more than three right four I think empat
sepuluh kot and then macam aku tahu we had to sign up right for the vans and then we had to put our names down for which vans you want to be in
so we sign up we sign up for like the last van cause tak ada orang like no americans wrote their names there I think right so we put names for the last van
ya same tanah air
um ya and then like all the americans already had their cliques and whatever so they dorang taruk nama dorang in the first few vans or whatever you know supposedly it's gonna be like a fun trip for them
and then err at the end of the whole thing we realised yang apa ni orang yang dalam van kita semua macam lebih mature I would say eh and like our van was like the most diverse diverse group of people and we knew we don't really know each other lah sebelum tu when we started the trip
but then by the end of the trip like the vans like the first like the the van yang first first tu semua macam
nanti dorang tak jadi kawan lagi ke apa tau macam at first dorang start off macam ghairah nak mampus macam woo woo woo tapi tu at the end of the
like the whole week dorang macam
macam enemies eh macam tak nak dorang gaduh banyak tak cakap apa-apa padahal untuk van kita
beginning macam
tak kesah all then at the end of the whole thing kita orang macam woo woo woo
berapa one week plus
I remember when kita dah balik he still message me for photo
I'm like ya like okay hantar hantar hantar hantar
so what what did we do kita buat oh we did bungee jumping
oh dia tolak
ya I was like siapa eh I think kaysa eh anyway I was just telling her like
I couldn't see where my legs were I couldn't see where I was going so of course I just raba raba
so instead instead of the muka-muka kawan it's basically
do you want to talk about the food atau makanan atau everyday activity
aku baru nak tanya what's stopping you
no the question was three but never mind I don't tengok we take turns ah
I mean dulu aku pernah
primary school pernah belajar apa inline skating so I'm assuming that it will be similar to ice skating
I feel like I pernah tanya kaysa
ya you know hari tu dorang saja-saja satu keluarga pergi pergi apa ni kat kallang punya eh ice skating sama-sama and then dorang complain budak-budak tu kacau
similar like if you can naik if you can inline skate then you can ice skate that's what she said
right and then if you you know especially why kau tengok kau tengok movie movie kan dorang tengok ah macam pretty women yang baru punya tu eh pretty women pula little women kan
and then they there was a scene where joe and laurie pergi kat lake and then after that they skate
tak hitam ke tak merah tak sunburn
banana boat ke
you tak tahu swim you tak nak mati
it's not it's not like the tarik you that kind
tak ada lah
oh ah memang a'ah
okay tapi tu kalau I if you tahu macam mana nak float kan aku rasa okay jer
kalau macam gitu then okay lah bye bye
asal kan kau tak mati okay jer macam floating is the kau tak mati
jangan apa ni jangan dapat cramps sudah
ah hujan ah

cable car dari bawah naik

huh suara lain sikit
tak payah nak try
so sabar so dia that means dia stop ah terus dia cabut as in
or memang plan dia memang until that time aje
kalau kita kita nak kena fikir lama-lama nak kena hmm
and then eventually we masih bodoh cakap jom boleh

oh sebab tu rasa selfish ah
mm itu dia panggil cognitive dissonance err basically
bila you tengok
err dekat certain negara
you boleh tengok dekat YouTube
yang buat video dia tengah makan anjing macam yang video orang korea selalu buat dia kan makan makanan ah jadi kat situ kelakar tau sebab
kita boleh nampak dislike pada video orang yang makan anjing tu banyak tapi bila dia makan steak biasa
ah banyak jer like lepas tu korang comments semua yang elok-elok lah cakap sedap lah tapi bila yang anjing tu ramai yang dislike then bagi comment
yang marah lah marah sebab makan anjing tapi kat situ macam mana dia agak
mm sebenarnya tu memang argument yang orang selalu pakai
err tapi dekat situ timbul satu problem macam mana intelligence satu sentient being diukur macam mana dia orang measure
so dah jadi satu problem kat situ
kalau I sendiri ah rasa mm morally memang kita salah lah kalau nak ikut daripada standpoint moral
I suka juga tengok daripada satu
daripada satu uh
evolutionary standpoint yang mana
kita dah dah mutated dah evolved
sentient being lain though so dah in a way dah adapt sebab tu bila kita cuma nak tinggalkan
mm tradition bukan tradition tinggalkan diet tu dia bagi kesan sampingan pada badan lah sebab banyak juga
orang-orang yang ex-vegan yang dah
last sekali dia orang
dia orang tinggalkan juga veganism sebab
health semakin teruk kan
ah in fact baru five thousand years dari ya yang yang recorded lah five thousand years baru start ada
before that takde yang dikenal pasti lah
itu masa mesopotamia kan
tak I akan start dengan vegetarian dulu sebab macam biasa ah ni
ramai orang yang cakap benda yang sama dia tak boleh tinggalkan cheese
telur yes yes tak boleh
last kita makan beef pun bila
a'ah ah tapi okay lah kira itu tahun lepas punya cerita ini sekarang tahun baru
mm tapi kita kan pernah discuss sebelum ni kalau macam susah
kalau tak nak nampak poyo kita kena buat buat ada macam health issue macam ada allergy ke makan makan meat products
ada allergy jadi kita boleh pura-pura ada
ada illness ah ada penyakit yang tak boleh yang membuatkan kita tak boleh
oh ya lah rasa serba salah rasa guilty dia dah masak kan
I was many tak tahu pun
just just fikir bila dah tengok banyak
banyak debate
then dia macam dia start to make sense lah bila
discussion pasal morality issues
mm back then I consider juga standpoint yang lagi satu lah yang memang
kalau ikutkan daripada organism yang pertama pun memang dia
even plants pun evolve daripada organism yang
yang first
mostly pasal philosophy yang mana yang mana start
start into into betul pun lepas
and jadi banyak masa untuk
untuk reflect
untuk fikir err meaning of life
and then macam-macam lah err
argument macam-macam discussion dapat
dapat tengok sebab free sangat kan banyak free time masa pandemic ni
so daripada situ
dapat counter balik
dapat counter balik permikiran yang sebelum-sebelum ni
bincangkan pasal veganism
dia macam selalu irritating kan annoying macam mana ah
tapi err recently lah dah start macam okay nampak ah kenapa dia
dia make sense
mm ya lah source of protein tu senang nak dapat ya especially is buat tempeh lah
and boleh replace
kita sendiri pun makan sandwich yang hidang dengan tempeh
tapi still once in a while memang rasa craving untuk
err beef too especially bila bayangkan steak
um yang medium rare ah
kat situ lah jadi problem tu dia kita ni
bunuh other sentient being untuk bagi pleasure pada taste bud kita mm ada juga orang yang
yang counter balik dia cakap okay and then macam mana handling dengan nyamuk macam mana dengan err lipas
takkan kita tak boleh nak bunuh kan
err dekat situ itu persoalan yang lain
mm dia orang invasive macam lipas nyamuk ni invasive so dia bukan macam
err lembu lembu kita factory farm and then kita bagi dia life yang teruk just for the sake untuk dapatkan
product just for the sake untuk
ah ha sebab lembu tu dia tak pernah kacau orang pun dia tak ada ah masuk rumah and then hisap darah ke
tapi pun ada juga yang yang certain vegan yang memang sampai to the extremes dia orang tak bunuh nyamuk they just tiup jer a lot macam tu jadi ah yang tu extreme sangat kot
I mean kalau kalau kalau creature lain human ke animal ke
kalau dia start untuk invade tu kita ada right untuk ni lah self-defence lah
anjing ke kalau dia kejar ah kita boleh ah baling batu ke
dia tak nak right untuk
apa-apakan dia lah
macam nak belajar serious pasal philosophy
apa lagi ah
tak tahu you start dulu nanti I boleh tiru you
ya lah tak even even for me as a musician
mm mm dia tak tak strong rasa macam nak
nak improve bukan
ada lah rasa nak improve tapi nak sebab nak practise tu dia macam tak motivated sangat dia macam ada nak
nak cari benda lain mm mm I mean music tu kita punya
kita punya career tapi
dia dia stay macam tu lah then kita akan improve tu maybe while ah then while while working while performing
mm mm itu memang
memang best
mm mm tapi sia
almost apa memang lah
vaccine pun
february baru masuk malaysia kita pun tak tahu ya ke tak singapore dah
mm a'ah jadi pasal language ya I tengah focus juga dengan nak focus greek ah greek dulu lepas tu italian yang
yang senang-senang ah dulu
mm mm mm japanese tu dia considered as
uh dia orang pernah sort of difficulty kan then lepas tu
err hardest language to learn lah dia ada sekali dengan arab tapi yang tu dia measure dia ikut ni err
perspective orang orang yang
yang speak english ah mm tapi mungkin untuk kita asian
maybe japanese tak susah mana kot
ah dia among the easiest
a'ah latin juga sebenarnya latin mm
aduh susah lah tak pernah ada azam
dia benda-benda yang beyond beyond our control macam contohnya nak nak border dibuka semula
tapi tu lah dia kena ni benda tu beyond our control lah yang
yang in our control
tak tahu ah sebab rasa macam semua benda boleh dapat sekarang
desire tu macam tak tahu nak apa ah
ya lah memang
memang takde takde isu pun lah twenty twenty tu cuma travel restriction jer lah itu jer
walaupun restricted pun kita dapat juga daripada penang ke perak ke johor
december ya lah sebab kita dapat hanya
mm working from home lepas tu dengan dia sebab dia new experience kan kita buat voice voice acting gitu
benda yang kita tak pernah buat jadi ah okay ah
predict ah apa apa yang malaysia akan
tahun ni lah ah twenty twenty one yang dia ah
ah predict lah macam mana
mm but then again memang ramai lah yang buat online content cuma lama-lama tengok rasa macam
boring juga sebab
mm contoh
contoh macam music lah kalau yang lain okey-dokey kalau yang macam discussion debates semua okay lagi kalau yang music ni macam lama-lama jadi boring ah tengok online ah redundant lepas tu
lepas tu tengok bayangkan lah dah err you have to pay the ticket but
memang lah dia orang buat dekat
ah venue venue yang ada sound system yang best
tapi still benda tu dia depend juga macam mana dengan uh audio system
audience masing-masing ada pakai err earphone yang murah earphone handphone mahal ke apa ke so dia still quality dia
tak main peranan sangat lah
mm mm especially kalau memang dah semua orang dah dapat vaccine betul
eh mesti lah
mesti ah mesti kita akan buat event
takde ah
it can kelakar jer tapi takpe ah kalau orang tak nak
ambil vaccine kan dekat sini kan memang err kalau
err siapa yang nak ambil vaccine itu could
ni lah secara sukarela kan volunteer kan
so biar lah yang tu
mm mm siapa yang tak nak tu kita serahkan kepada yes
I rasa nanti kalau macam dia jadi back to normal dia akan ada ya lah dia akan
um celebrate sekejap dia akan macam wow ah finally dunia luar
mm tapi rasanya benda tu takkan dia punya excitement tu dia takkan tahan lama pun dia macam sekejap jer and then orang lupa balik sebab
err even masa
pandemic ni pun dengan dengan semua orang ada internet memang literally semua orang ada
daripada socialising ah so macam dia dia
not a big deals sangat pun pandemic ni cuma memang lah ah physically
mm memang tapi uh physically memang lah dia orang crave untuk jumpa depan-depan tapi sebab ada internet ni
dan tu lah sebab tu nanti excitement dia akan sekejap jer
oh tapi err
nanti bila bila dah normal balik maybe semua orang boleh jumpa secara fizikal tapi dengan dengan perspective yang baru lah ah maybe sebab dia dah banyak spend time sebelum ni dia dia walaupun dia banyak free time untuk
err walaupun smartphone memang ada kat dalam tangan sentiasa tapi dia orang banyak tengok
macam content content yang wasteful lah yang macam setakat tengok meme jer
tapi masa pandemic ni macam ramai pula yang
dia tiba subscribed to a skillshare ah ambil
ah kelas-kelas yang macam-macam kan so dia dah start gunakan free time dia betul-betul and then dia betul-betul masuk ke dalam dunia internet yang positif ah
so dia dapat banyak gila input
ada shift
yes and no biasa jer biasa jer yes tu sebab
sebab kita travel kan kita dapat pergi
mm pergi keluar kita dapat
and then mm masa kita masuk pandemic baru nak start pun kita memang baru balik kan
so benda-benda tu memang rindu lah benda-benda tu tapi
daripada tahun yang pandemic ni pun
not bad juga so dia macam dah biasa
mm boleh lah memang
memang naturally stoic kot
rumit lah kan ah tak lah in in a nutshell dia just pasal
pasal being remaining neutral lah dia macam
bukan pessimist dan bukan optimist ni in a in a nutshell lah mm dia punya actual definition dia tak pasti lah macam mana tapi in a nutshell yang I faham
remain tegak jer tau ah macam
kalau benda teruk jadi yang beyond kita punya control and then apa yang kita boleh buat ah just
and then bila
datang satu benda excitement pun
jangan jangan terlalu ah jangan telalu absorbed jangan terlalu soaked in dalam feeling yang
yang kuat tau sebab nanti dia akan ada
apa pendulum effect
mm dia akan bidas balik
nihilism tapi tak lah nihilism
boleh lah nihilism ni dia just
except yang kalau kalau kalau
kalau life ni takde meaning pun
takpe lah sebab ada orang dia macam strive untuk cari meaning dia
tapi what if
memang takde meaning apa-apa memang
datang dan pergi macam tu jer kan just play along jer lah
ah memang ah
mm kalau ni memang banyak refer pada nature ah tapi
mm okay sebenarnya dia dia bukannya
err bukan yang teruk sebab ada juga term optimistic nihilism
mm mm before that memang ada encounter tu tapi good place tu dia macam lagi explaining dia explaining lah
mm kalau kau tak tahu pun macam tak tahu pun benda ni dibincangkan cuma
sebelum ni kita experience kan kita macam
mm start ada turning point untuk
ah rasa macam dapat revelation in something
and then bila tengok memang ada
memang ada study pasal ni err seronok lah sebab dia explain kan
mm hmm hmm memang lah memang tak boleh shaft pun tapi boleh
boleh introduce lah introducing okay tapi bila shaft
shaving new opinion tu
tak boleh lah
oh macam tu boleh cakap apa ah
macam tu boleh cakap lah
tak tau ah other than philosophy takde mmhmm
kali nak nak lebihkan pada scandinavian countries tu
mm sebab nak tengok
mm tengok system dia
mm ya lah yang tu semua memang nak repeat
tapi ah a'ah a
termasuk lah
kalau tak kan
lepas lepas bukan sweden denmark mm
euro centric tak tak western lah
sebab kita tak consider canada ya tapi
sebab dia punya ni kot dia punya historical value
kalau asian countries entah north korea
mm mm sebab tu
sebab tu macam history kat sini pun kadang-kadang dengar pun macam made up stories sebab dia tak perlu preserve kan
aiyo tak tahu pun
mm mm tapi the sangat kan
takde lah dia bukannya kalau being stoic ke macam terus eliminate ke
so sebab lagi muda lagi orang akan
ambil seriously kot sebab dia tengok macam umur lima belas dah start buat semua ni
lepas tu tapi still ambil lah sebab nanti mungkin boleh guna untuk summer study kan
mm apa lagi ah tukar
entah tukar nama tak ah tak tahu lah
takde tak against sangat pun against ah against against sekolah semua sekolah yang I pergi
I went to seven schools and takde yang betul-betul
dapat tarik interest untuk belajar kan dia punya
ya lah ini memang lah semua orang faham lah mm bukan kita jer faham semua orang tahu benda ni
kalau korang start
sembang pasal education system jer lah memang macam gini jer lah dia punya outcome
kat internet
tapi ada laptop kan
ambil ah
entah macam mana kalau lockdown lagi kan tak guna
bukan a'ah
hampa jer
mm lapan minit ni
boleh cakap pasal apa your hope was a upper you hook
pada home country you
boleh ke ah okay
uh sebenarnya stoic juga ah mm
tu lah change yang nak tengok
ya lah dia beyond kita punya control kan tapi still okay lah kalau betul ada change yang boleh nak tengok nak tengok
a'ah maknanya takde campur tangan
tak tak kesah lah politician ke sesiapa pun banyak yang kalau nak
some sort of gain dia akan main dengan
a'ah dengan sentiment agama kan mm
just kalau nak tengok ni boleh lah tengok kat Facebook comments jer dah cukup dah
so banyak yang memang tak
biasa ah benda ni biasa yang dia nampak tajuk jer lepas tu dia terus comment mm mm
itu pun uh itu
a'ah a'ah a'ah betul
kita kena blame juga journalism bad journalism dia memang
tak boleh ah dia dia kena fikir lah uh siapa
dia kena fikir juga untuk orang yang malas membaca ni dia kena bagi title tu memang terus
mm click bait okay tapi kalau kalau buat video YouTube okay kot
tapi kalau buat err news header jangan lah
sebab tu lah yang orang baca pasal vaksin ni juga ada side effect eh bukan side effect dia dah ambil ah
mm mm padahal baru ambil yang first shot tu kan
tapi orang terus rasa macam cakap oh K maknanya vaksin tak berkesan atau apa lah
ya lah memang itu yang dia jadi sepanjang adanya
it is err sejak kelahiran journalism
yang penting jalan yang penting dapat duit advertisement mm
tapi itu lah benda ni yang kita memang dah selalu sangat sembang teliti macam tu lah lagi authentic
mm kita dah bual benda ni dah dah berapa kali dah sebelum ni sorry
ini call of duty
contoh pergi makan ah
kita pergi makan ini lah seoul garden
pun boleh juga wakuwaku pun boleh juga
bawa duit ah wakuwaku mahal daripada seoul garden kan
can ah jalan masjid pun okay juga
kita kita okay
I think kita kita ah if I uh just uh kawan ah

err tak cukup lagi ida ida tak cukup
okay akak ada satu lagi top achievement akak
akak first time bayar zakat pendapatan
that one is the first one akak bayar zakat pendapatan alhamdulillah
okay okay okay ida ada lagi
what were the top five painful lesson that you learnt allah
okay akak dulu
staff yang kita orang baru ambil bekerja selama sebulan berhenti
okay dia cakap ya lah sebab macam kita orang tak dapat pindah then kalau pindah macam mana business dekat sini and so on kan so macam dia
ya lah mempertikaikan mengapa perempuan tak boleh ke buat business kan ha ah macam tu a'ah I don't know we don't know
the first one the second one ada juga staff yang berhenti
that is under our ini lah macam kita sponsor
satu team um e-sports
dia tak lah directly tapi that
because the person yang err handle yang team e-sport itu adalah among our business partners
yang our staff yang bukan lah our staff macam his staff yang berhenti itu kan
memang macam rude lah bahasa yang dia gunakan sangat rude
dia itu macam ini tak err bukan competence tak competence lah dia kata tak bagus lah apa semua memang rude
memang rude kalau baca message dia memang rude
a'ah itu ah macam kan kan sudah tak pernah kerja tempat lain tapi
tak apa lah okay so that one is second
ingat tak waktu bulan tiga apa yang berlaku we need to refund
fifteen K to uh our clients lah because waktu itu ah
project tak dapat jalan and COVID comes and then
actually dia orang nak minta kita bayar dua puluh ribu ah
tapi err we said to them yang kita kan sudah buat kerja sikit so kenapa nak refund full
so dia orang minta refund lima belas ribu then
that one is very tough lah untuk kita semua for her for us as a team and
for others lah juga untuk dia juga lah
and that one is better for her juga lah sebenarnya okay
okay so empat saja boleh tak
terlalu painful lah okay ida tak nak cakap tak nak cerita lima okay
waktu dia susah bukannya waktu kita susah lah okay
balik lah
mm mm cakap saja lah terus terang
okay yang awak rasa macam top lima yang memang awak rasa awak buat keputusan yang betul yang awak betul lah
ya sama
walaupun kita duduk seorang tapi rasanya macam yup yup tapi tak lah memikirkan masalah di rumah
okay that one is the first one sama dengan akak juga second one
okay alright teruskan teruskan
tempat asal lah tempat awak tinggal awak dapat tawaran dekat tempat asal awak lahir okay then
stay tempat yang ada sekarang tempat yang awak belajar lah
err saat rasa macam ada certain soalan macam a bit repeat lah
okay let's say sudah tak ada
apa ah top five things yang you got right is the first one is I made a
bukan lah ada bukan lah make decision pun I terpaksa pun untuk hantar thesis I supaya I dapat viva
nak kena mengasuh dia orang bagi faham lah apa benda lah lepas itu tak faham-faham juga
but then ada staff yang we got it right yang bagus
walaupun macam yang mungkin macam gaji yang kita bagi pun tak ini tapi we promise to her that we might be give you
better later because kita pun tak kaya kan
so kita tak nak lah share kekayaan itu di kalangan kita saja kita mesti nak share dengan orang lain juga
okay so I'm not sure it is the got right ke tak tapi
ah mempertimbangkan lah okay entah lah ada berapa sudah empat kan empat saja lah okay next question
okay akak dulu ah okay risiko terbesar yang akak ambil adalah
macam to from kelas mengaji err class mengaji physical to online fully
and memang struggle ya allah ya rabbi buat facebook live and so on macam gitu kan
tapi we managed to do that lah walaupun struggle
totally memang change and then after that we build um err jauhari
masih dalam progress and hero cilik waktu itu and like then juga shine untuk board game lah
tak ada okay we skip all that question then soalan keenam
what was the smartest decision you made dekat sama kan
okay tak payah lah okay next which three important relationship improved the most family tadi awak cakap lagi
alright okay dua okay so macam akak pun akak the first one is
err ya lah our relationship eh kita tak ada siapa-siapa kita dua orang saja ida okay with my room mate dengan ida
akak rasa akak better sikit dengan ayah akak kot
selama ini akak ada perception yang macam
anggap tak baik apa semua kan tapi bila akak macam bantu dia untuk kerja sekejap
kak kak nampak lah dia usaha dan dia struggle
kak relationship dengan itu lah ah okay okay
ah that guy okay cuma
ya lah macam dulu kan akak ini macam lelaki ini apa teruk ah apa semua kan but right now okay just be understanding lah okay nombor sembilan
dia beri greatest impact dekat ida lah
okay aduh sebab
ya lah sebab tahun ini kan kita jarang masa bersama dia kau orang okay untuk akak
err ada dua lah dua close friend okay err
bukan lah someone yang yang bersama-sama dengan kami sudah dalam business partner
tapi dia tetap seorang sahabat yang ada kadang-kadang sometime bila kita macam
contact dia minta nasihat ke apa ke walaupun saya memang marah lah dekat dia tetap lah orang yang beri impact kepada saya lah okay
first one jadi seorang yang lebih baik atau seorang yang pemarah ada dua kan the second one um
okay second one yang memang sentiasa kalau misal kata okay dia kalau dia ada masalah dia akan call
dia akan call akak tapi dia pun sedia untuk mendengar apa masalah kita
okay then last year is the first one yang akak cerita dengan dia after few years lah sudah berkawan kan
baru lah akak reveal dekat dia siapa yang bagi teratai akak rasa tahun lepas ya that one
akak reveal ah sedangkan orang bagi sudah teratai sejak tahun dua ribu sebelas
ah sudah sembilan tahun sudah waktu itu kawan err apa
yang kawan akak yang sudah ini kan yang sudah yang sudah pindah balik itu
err akak tanya okay okay memandangkan awak sudah tak ada kan okay ada satu benda yang ini nak bagi tahu okay so bagi tahu lah yang akak yang bagi teratai itu okay
um my parents err no I mean not err err macam
err macam sometime not in a good side but somehow
it turns to be a bad side juga okay uh so
greatest impact sebab greatest impact tak tahu apa benda ah okay soalan nombor sepuluh ida
okay ramai itu okay
ya lah family lah kan family mak ayah adik itu saja lah
third spend time the most ini boleh jadi orang yang kita call
yang paling nak akak cakap dengan top first
asnah lah itu tak dapat dinafikan itu memang top first lah
sudah okay next how did those five people influence you wow ambil engkau
yes so dia banyak bagi nasihat and so on lah
okay bagus bagus so itu lah yang paling most impact lah
okay so akak err
influence yang the first one is asnah
dia yang suggest sudah lama sudah dia memang suggest untuk akak pergi jumpa psychiatric
instead of counsellor ah sebab dia tak dia rasa it's not ini lah kan
and then after yang um
akak punya akak go talk dengan doctor doctor itu kan yang akak cakap dengan awak itu
and then after that akak decide memang akak tak nak go for university punya
akak go for memang professional punya field lah
and then um apa macam mana dia apa ini how impactful these five people ini
um tadi parents akak dan juga akak cakap pasal madrasah kan okay so madrasah yang akak pergi ini um
dia orang err most of them are refugees
okay and there is uh ada satu macam episode lah yang mana seorang budak ini dia
ganggu tau lembu dekat kawasan itu
orang kampung lah kata dia nampak okay but then um and then
macam pihak penguasaan madrasah ini macam marah lah and tampar budak itu depan mata akak
so itu akak rasa macam sudah lah you sudah lah dia refugees tahu dia memang
macam itu lah kan macam memang ya lah kita tak tahu negara dia dulu macam mana kan
memang ya lah mungkin dia orang bermasalah tapi dia dia orang adalah kanak-kanak yang ada perasaan
okay so issue nya adalah budak itu duduk tonggeng-tonggeng
punggung dekat orang kampung lah apa semua lepas itu main lepas itu macam
lepas itu err I talk to my dad lah waktu itu kan macam mm
anak ah cucu dia buat benda yang sama tak sama saja so apa
apa beza cucu dengan orang yang dia jaga ini ini kan
sama saja dia orang pun budak juga even err ya lah memang cucu lah umur bawah kecil sikit kan tapi sama saja
uh these refugees kulit hitam ke kenapa kita tak respect dia
okay so that one like yang I rasa err macam lagi kasihan dekat budak-budak semua ini so
these people ini yang give greatest impact to me lah okay soalan nombor sepuluh
who are the five people you spend the bukan ah sudah sudah salah salah nombor dua belas nombor dua belas what were the best five books you read
tapi dia tak ada cakap dua puluh dua puluh tahu dia bagi tahu what were the best five books you read itu saja
err daun tidak membenci angin macam itu ah
dia pasal cerita saja macam itu ah and
buku itu daripada bukan daripada ini lah dia memang negara luar punya
apa uh daun tidak membenci angin macam itu tajuk dia kalau tak silap ah ah okay
buat cerita apa ini dengan activity dengan budak-budak macam itu lah tapi
and ada satu masa itu ah dia punya quote dia macam ini ah
okay kita banyak menyalahkan takdir tapi semua yang jadi ini semua tuhan sudah tahu
even macam daun yang jatuh pun allah atas kan sudah allah kan ah
so benda itu just go with the flow jer okay so the first book
okay ida ada lagi tak buku sambil-sambil tu kita tukar-tukar lah
buku english
okay nanti aku nak baca
oh okay dia orang tak kahwin
okay walaupun dia sudah tak ada
okay okay akak ada satu lagi err buku yang akak rasa macam ini
ah sepanjang COVID err kak asnah suggest untuk akak baca lah who moved my cheese
ah that one ah dia macam okay
err dia orang dia ada beberapa ini lah beberapa character mm
tikus lah yang mana yang stay
sampai lah cheese itu habis
maksudnya tapi sebelum cheese itu habis lagipun um waktu cheese itu ada dia orang sampai sudah buat rumah apa semua dekat situ
which is these people adalah orang yang cepat settle down
tapi bila cheese sudah habis macam mana kan tempat sudah dekat situ apa semua so macam itu lah
and another one adalah orang yang nampak orang yang tahu cheese ini akan habis
so dia get ready with another another option okay
and daripada dua ekor ini juga dia orang ada yang berpecah satu lagi memang nak stay
berharap yang orang akan hantar lagi cheese dekat situ
cari cheese tapi tak jumpa struggle jatuh terduduk macam nak mati nak macam semua lah
tapi akhirnya dia jumpa cheese
uh tapi tapi after that the fasa yang sangat sangat teruk lah okay
ah itu lah who moved my cheese lah okay lagi ada buku lagi tak baru dua
ah then another one is err buku karangan liyana musfira ini err
dia macam untuk buku untuk wanita-wanita lah yang mana yang orang rasa orang cakap ah sudah tua tak kahwin lagi
ah sudah kahwin tak ada anak err sudah kahwin satu anak nak dua
lepas itu orang yang memang pilih untuk business dan sebagainya dan semuanya silap
a'ah kan tak ada benda yang betul pun tapi asyik dipertikaikan so macam mana kita nak
err apa bangun daripada scars pun dia bagi tahu okay
ada ada fasa yang macam bila akak seorang then ah then a lot of things kan
this world doesn't deserve me ah macam itu ah so
this is the first lah yang I I'm grateful for is I am still alive
that one lah akak punya satu ah akak tak terfikir lagi
walaupun masih ingat-ingat lah kan sis K of course ah tak boleh lupa
right err benda yang patut disyukurkan lagi adalah
actually banyak ah business apa semua akak

okay sudah right
so that this um apa ini
kita punya resolution untuk eh resolution
atas view of orchard tapi err in a budget hotel
I mean okay lah I mean considering dia punya apa tu space and all that is really small but I just think that it's quite macam convenient and comfortable because macam very cosy
ya it's it's really giving me the vibes because macam like you have to walk through the lorong and all that to find the entrance and then along the way you see people
you see like residential and all that lah so macam I actually do feel like as if I'm not in singapore ya although once you step out onto orchard road then you'll be like ah okay
I hate it oh my god macam like betul betul self-conscious sia oh my god will she see my body
nobody's going to stare I mean I know you're not gonna stare kalau like terglare and then you like oh no
ya ya I'm fine with it I mean it's not like we datang selalu kan so
ya then you have to wait lah queue then wait for the aunty to like okay adik berapa orang okay dua orang duduk okay ah
adik also it's not abang okay it's adik cause he's younger than us ya
I also don't know lah but he look I call him adik cause it's just an insult to him can you imagine if it's if you you talk to him ah adik nasi ayam dua I tell you it'll be so insulting
we'll be like adik nasi ayam dua satu tak nak sambal
not being very friendly because we've always had our encounters with uh female punya shopkeeper yang macam fierce and garang right
nak apa dik nak apa huh makan lah dik semua tak nak
ya so macam like oh okay lah maybe he wants to be one of the first few male stall keepers or store owners ya don't have a very friendly approach to their customers
lucky plaza sahaja so I think because you see eh the near nenek atau mak tak tahu lah dia punya atuk ke apa they are actually very friendly people ya so I think that's what
attracted people or to you know to want to keep coming and all that cause dorang tahu macam orh ah nak pakcik ni cute ah macam like dia selalu smiling
and also because if you are working there and it's lunchtime you wouldn't want to like waste so much time talking and then especially kalau queue makanan kau sampai of course you want to cepat-cepat kasi habis pe
you mean angkat ayam merah oh ya
oh yang kat tepi err
mm I mean macam like what I mean is like my brother-in-law
like he he he's on a keto diet he works out and all that tapi ah ya his diabetic punya reading has reduced but his cholesterol level is still high up there so ya it really depends ah I mean yes you lead a healthy lifestyle but certain things you cannot avoid
he did this one going on for a couple of years what it's just that macam he only started yang exercise is much more rigorous because err he goes I mean he eventually found like kaki to you know run and all there and then you know lah people kat sana dorang selalu macam nak
buat apa tu compete siapa lari lagi banyak and all that ya
ya so I don't know how is it like ya but whatever it is there are I mean there are cases whereby orang macam like oh they lead healthy lifestyle but my children turn out to be diabetic that kind of thing so it really depends lah so it's always good to always
uh check whether you punya you know levels okay ke tak
it's very frustrating ah macam like especially for my brother-in-law cause dia dah yes my don't know my blood sugar sugar reading has is now acceptable
cause he's really looking forward to be put back on so boleh naik pangkat
ya exactly but because doctor kata dia ada this certain levels you know that kind of thing so dia tak boleh ambil ah ya so he needs to be macam semua okay so that he can resume taking then lepas tu baru dia boleh considered for uh promotion
mm I mean like you will be wondering lah so I remember macam like on sangat kuruskan badan lah and all that because ya he's stuck there because like macam they said that oh because of your health you know maybe you cannot do a lot of rigorous work so cannot
get promoted macam tu ah
not ya this is going to be a long period lah mana boleh overnight turn kau ni pun
so ya so um I mean I was telling lah maybe you know nutritionist or dietitian you know tell them that okay I nak turunkan my eh my cholesterol level so how do I start off how do I do so
tak lah dia pergi doctor just untuk check dia punya apa tu blood sugar level then cholesterol level is nothing to do with macam like okay so what am I supposed to do next it's just that main pun gila so aku marah dengan kakak
but just tauge because err okay
ya ya that's one thing that I don't really like cause like macam you want to be healthy then okay lor unless you you know it's really your source of income whereby you share with your viewers what you've been doing so that they can learn from there and all that tapi setakat macam nak like show off then ugh
I like apa tu make your own plans lah as
no more like my father is atas not us we're not there yet
apanya yang birch car punya skirt
oh okay okay uh yang baju lengan pendek tu ah okay okay
but now it's available kau tak nak beli
beli satu jer
mm mm it's really about whether or not um you nak better details but you need to take care of the material ataupun
and specifically macam like you do not have menses on that day
four or five pieces of clothing on depends ah sometimes I buy more if there's like available designs then I don't I don't spend for the next six months then I wait macam cause I beli tengah mid year sale atau end year sale
and then I will purposely go bila err towards the end of the sale period I mean I know there's not more there's not many err options for me so I just make do with what's available lah
you know like okay lah boleh pakai pergi kerja boleh pergi mana which explains my poor choices of clothing lately lah it's really makcik makcik bodoh but then
ada ada yang teruk lah aku macam terjujur juga
mm mm no but you must also always set aside something lah like for your self-care and all that tapi it's just with self-care fund that you dah set aside you have to really properly choose your battle lah macam like I nak pergi let's say lah pedi mani mani pedi ke lagi massage ke you know
um hair treatment ke so it's really macam you have to choose one of those macam ya
macam staycay you know that kind of thing with your husband that kind of thing ya tak boleh macam like I nak pergi staycay then lepas tu I nak buat kuku I I nak buat rambut I no no such thing ya
maintain lah bengok
no it's really about macam the people that you you mingle with and all that and whether or not they can actually see the difference because nobody knows or cares like you don't wear the tag outside you know unless you wear a dress that just splash like that kind of thing you know
ya so technically kalau macam begitu
kalau macam begitu lah it really depends actually ya um you what you buy something that you really foresee yourself wearing it a couple of times and you're comfortable with it ya murah tak kesah asalkan okay lah you guna kan
kat ion yes
I mean if don't have also you can always pergi dengan
dengan apa tu yang budak yang baru kena inject kat uh spine cause she was heavy breathing yesterday right
then itu lah naik Grab mm
ya exactly but he can what he can do is just uh call the hospital just to inform and then after that err tell them that I will update again when I'm collecting lah than daripada keep quiet call kena towed away you know we don't want that to happen
why would you not inform the building or the hospital building that you have left a vehicle there bodoh sia
ya but the doctor's not gonna keep checking every single time eh motor ada kat situ tak motor ada kat situ tak
mm mm so ya lah nak kena kena actually call or inform at least just to check
never it's my first time I mean I've heard of it before tapi
no never because I think because of location macam
ya so far so tak tak hairan lah
ya lah that was even later you know that was in october ya so the paling recent pun
ya can you imagine oh my god letak the kids at home I need to get them out
no lah because you have to book in cause you just you just got the vouchers right so you can only book macam only now lah recently sebelum ni tak boleh book in advance
ya ya ya staycay is that one lah that one is a given itu ada book err quite early
tapi macam like
ya lah new year pun expensive lah mana mana expensive seh cause nak step tengok fireworks ah and all that
can you imagine you stay here then kau nampak kat hujung there's fireworks okay ah
eh but if you have new year's eve kat sini then you look out quite nice eh
oh okay okay tahu tahu a'ah tahu tahu okay okay
mahal gila mahal gila I mean dia macam chalet eh ke apa ni
resort lah macam itu
ee boring nya
now just lebih mahal sia
nak beratur still mahal satu malam
ya but at least kau turun pun banyak barang kau boleh buat apa
I mean you can do a lot go jewel walk walk look at the fountain kat sana tengok momok
ya the thing is kadang kala how soon are you even going to set foot out of singapore I mean kalau nak kata kan pulau ubin okay lah eh but you you don't need a passport for that tapi I mean like international-wise
I don't think it's gonna be anytime soon ah maybe like macam pertengahan twenty twenty one
I entah lah aku mana tahu
they delayed because err tiba-tiba ada the spike in the number of cases ah
and sketchy sekarang
I think macam I think kat thailand macam tak teruk sangat kau tahu tapi yang teruk would be macam kat um malaysia
because I think number of cases so far yang dorang report kat news thailand macam tak ada jer
mean ada yang tempat rural ke
I mean for him is like we shouldn't have had done more tests right bodoh
ya like you know we have our rights we have our amendments and all that then okay lah kasut kau orang lah I feel like these are the people that shouldn't be getting any err medical attention if they ever get COVID
all over the country oh bagus lah good job
mm mm mm mm tengok jer lah
how sure are you there are the same group of people mungkin tak lah ada tapi segelintir
daripada dorang ada buat merepek ni then you like ah korang minta kena sepak
ya you know that time dekat asia one kan tunjuk dua budak remaja kat dalam train tak pakai mask bodoh betul
that's the thing someone took a picture but then after that I don't know whether any actions were taking they taken by you know the safe distancing ambassador atau the staff and all that
so like I I just feel like kadang-kadang orang singapore ini kan dorang banyak complain banyak ambil gambar banyak submit video when it comes to action it's zero so annoying
ada lah segelintir
no dia kena saman lazarus island pun sama semua kena saman
I feel like you kalau jail yang perempuan yang kata mana tak
ya that one she does it she did it repeatedly kalau you want to talk about jail then she should be jailed because like first time tak serik second time tak serik
ya lah but the thing is it still has to be fair for everyone lah like got the first time okay kalau kau buat lagi then that's it kau minta kena sepak you know that kind of thing
apa dia we have what
no the thing is adela they have different arrangement adela so macam like offices right now right they said ah cannot have more than fifty employees at one time
okay and then like in my office right they have that macam
kan begini ah seh
khatib khatib kat mana ni
oh kat yishun itu
oh yang ah ya ya I wanted to ask him mana then I I saw HomeTeam
panjat panjat panjat then lepas tu
but ada lah I've been avoiding arrows so much
alah kesian
maybe should just put disclaimer I'm really nice please don't take my niceness wrongly you know macam cerita a walk to remember please don't fall in love with me
oh ya that's true dorang just bengat gila sia
yes ke bedek ah you know like ah
aww awak ambil berat tentang saya ke oh alah comelnya naik nombor boleh ah pergi mampus lah
ku baik salah ku tak baik salah semua adiknya pergi mampus lah
I think no lah maybe just because like I don't know maybe dorang main game and then it's nice to talk and because it's really a place for you to macam vent you know dekat rumah you know that kind of thing
okay jer lah aku dah biasa benda begini
like ya like I even have my favourite buaya at uh
no lah because you know kat malaysia kan ada satu video ni the mum ke the father ask the the child bunyi ayam macam mana bunyi kucing macam mana bunyi itik macam mana
I tak tahu and then bunyi buaya macam mana the bunyi buaya is hi sayang
ya so what I mean my favourite buaya is I have this one player who always use the same line on me every single time we play
so I was like eh buaya favourite I and then he's like hi sayang still bisik-bisik nak tidur kan ah macam mana you tahu
I'll be like pergi mampus boleh ya
uh ya usually do that in the presence of other guys then they'll be like kau yang buaya lah sia
tak tahu lah aku malas layan tu kalau dorang mengamuk tu antara bini dengan dia bukan aku nya pasal
alah kesian
kan you main game lah belajar lah main game
I mean nak kena ada schedule lah like okay my previous clan right err
they they are they are they are all muslim married and they have children and all that so what they do is uh they they actually actually agreed with their wife tahu macam okay I will settle everything I will take care of the kids you know homework and all that but then I will play I will have my playing time from nine thirty onwards
is is is is surprising because you know why pasal mereka berbual dalam telephone kan eh dalam game okay abang dah habis ngaji bang okay sekarang barang simpan dalam beg lepas tu balik bilik tidur eh
adik adik macam mana adik homework dah habis ke dik okay kalau dah habis tu kalau tak buat kasi habis dah habis nanti abah check nanti adik boleh tidur
so it's normal lah I mean like there are people who can actually like set aside time you know err really manage time and all that tapi ada tak tahu lah yang macam bengap semacam
I mean like there are a few macam like shirk responsibility sanggup balik rumah lambat and all that pasal nak main game kat luar
tak tahu mana aku tahu but long time never play with the person so I also don't know what happen to him
ya I already at that point of time I thought dia belum kahwin tahu because uh my that time my friend was like kau dekat rumah bujang uh uh then I was like rumah bujang then after that I ask my friend then I said rumah bujang tu apa dia kata macam like you know like basically is what they mean like for us is void deck tapi dorang mana rumah flat kat situ kan so is macam like those
pondok-pondok like kosong like people rest
mm mm macam itu lah along the road ada satu err so that's what they call rumah bujang lah
tak tak tepi road lah tapi ah correct ya ya correct ah ah ah lah sial
then aku aku macam cause nanti dia macam like okay aku nak balik
eh kat mana ni sekarang
eh lawa kat rumah bujang ni then I was like that's when like I was I was like asking my friend after he left the group ah the lobby right
dia tanya kau orang eh
uh rumah bujang tu apa rumah tempat dorang lepak-lepaknya you know macam like macam like okay rumah dia tak boleh lepak ke and then he's like tak tahu lah you tanya dia sendiri
ya and then that time I managed to ask the person lah I said asal kau tak main kat rumah sendiri err dia kata kat rumah dia punya internet tak bagus pasal kat dia nya rumah dekat-dekat dengan hutan-hutan situ
fair enough because like macam awak that time even like normal phone reception
was really bad because it's really near the hutan
ya so I'm like okay lah fair enough lah desak kau kau buat apa kau nak
ya lah data pun tak boleh
ya it's just cause it's really because of reception so-called research tak bagus data pun tak bagus
actually right I think it's just the telco problem because like my friend's kat itself like the area itself is not that highland it's quite macam low to medium right depending ah
so ya so I think it's just the country telcos lah lepas alah
kan macam kat atas bukit pun boleh kau ambil
ya ya I do that tapi nak kena ada portable charger lah or maybe mm mm mm
tapi kalau macam like err either a portable charger then I can play for awhile and then after that charge my phone like for a while
mm mm betul betul
it's literally macam cucuk selah
apa pasal aku berdarah sia kat bawah
like I feel like I fell like macam I be right again
so macam lepas tu aku pergi toilet kan I kencing lepas tu aku tengok ada darah I was like
takut bilang kau that time
akunya akunya benda baik balik bodoh
is because it's really macam masuk then dia pakai macam clamp sakit bodoh
kau belum kena lagi kan berbual banyak huh
they do put the benda macam gel like cold gel or warm gel don't remember at your your area there
no it's very fast it's not even five minutes it's lesser than that cuma like the initial part a bit painful lah
you know it think about it it's for your health so you just do it it's very fast the cepat and you get the result on the spot also
ah kalau ada fibroid ke tak so buat buat sekali lah and then
I know but the thing is my mum also was in pain and then she was like macam like she let up a yelp right and then after that I'm like begini sudah beranak dua no I said no I said I said dah beranak dua kali pun nak bising and then when I kena
okay no she wasn't there right so when I told her sakit baru kau tahu macam sakit she's like
I don't know why but she's always been waiting to use that line on her children like I still remember that time when my sister first give birth and she was complaining to my mum like sakitnya badan berapa sakitnya then she's like baru kau tahu macam mana sakitnya beranakan
ada ambil ah
eh but then when I was at the clinic ini kan it's so awkward
because semua orang datang dengan dorang punya partner I went there alone
tak tahu apa nak buat kesian like husband pandai buat you know that kind of thing
bila nak penetrate semua nak ya bodohnya jantan
ya depan belakang tak boleh okay pusat pun boleh
ya air air I also quite a number of people lah you know people in who had late pregnancies then I see teenagers with their mum it's so it's quite sad actually
like I pretend macam dengar music daripada hal
tak nampak pregnant ah tapi dia macam nangis lah but I wanted to tell the mum like you're doing a great job ya
unless ada orang tolong jagakan anak dia lah
mmhmm lepas beranak ah mm mm
macam like sexual education but not about abstaining like I think that abstaining not aduh what is not a question anymore you know cause like they're doing it at a very young age I think it's more about macam how to have sex responsibly or safely
pakai tu lah saran wrap
ya because err err kadang-kadang you know before when they did that ligation right maybe an egg has already been released

gee what what what's wrong with me dulu berani eh tau then sekarang macam open shutter
ya lah that is my bekal lah I haven't eat lah I don't know what to eat
that's why like my break time I really macam because breakfast I don't makan
like unless my mother like prepare for me and I makan ah tapi kalau dia tak kasih then macam tak ada ah
eh japan pula thailand tamarind chicken
wet market and market pasar market
so mee soto nasi ayam sup kambing the best sup kambing in singapore is there
pasar lah
ya we have kedai mamak like you know the movies
at the pasar there where you can find variety of food lah
but like the only thing that I find macam sedap gila
nasi ayamdia in the world
like you can eat the rice only and then you will feel like damn sedap
nasi ayam now
you know those bawah block yang ada own fast food thing
nasi ayam western those chicken the rice is chicken rice
tapi dia punya chicken tu macam yang two wing
like the malay food I would not recommend kalau macam makan lunchtime only during your breakfast sedap gila because that two kedai only open for breakfast and they will close
dia sedap gila they only open for breakfast
siala aku belum tanya pun siol
cheebye tak ada tak ada tak ada tak ada dah habis dah habis dah habis dah habis
hey sedih sia
nak apa dik at least lah eh
makcik ni false hope ah
mm or sotong ball
uh apa tu
you boleh bukakan tak package I tak nak lah
semua big and then irritating lepas tu selalunya my cat down here then I say eh tepi lah
dah lah aku ni berbulu dia ni pun berbulu
forty five kecil begini jer nanti hug dia
tak nak lah super light gray this is nice this is just nice
oh it's nice pasar makan
pasar makan jer
hey actually okay lah but then like I cannot I condemn nasi campur melayu
it's so mahal
it's called my kampung
chinese stall you know tak chinese stall yang macam economy rice
but they make it nasi padang
ya and then tempat then like got a lot of cuisine and then everything's halal and then like you don't have to worry
sebelah dia ada waffle
siot lah tak ada mood sia
ya but because I think like clifford tu macam kena jalan kena tempuh tempuh clifford kena tempuh like tau
ah tadi kerja macam mana
oo jadi
habis participants pun sikit ah
jadi dia orang bawa banyak duit ah kalau berapa banyak hari macam gitu
um jadi ah apa habis tapi tiga orang jer kan tadi
tadi dari um apa sektor
tak ada lah
tak tadi nenek tak pekik ah apa pagi dia terbangun then dia pekik sekejap lah sebab ini tapi biasa lah dia tak ada dia punya maki-maki hamun lah
then I think dia lapar biasa dia minta pergi toilet tapi dia tak minta solat solat lagi ah dia tak I think because dia nampak mak keluar pergi kerja kan jadi dia tahu dia seorang seorang dengan bibik jadi dia diam aje
um so entah um tak ada anxiety tak ada ah
tapi selalu panggil doktor lepas tu dia orang cakap apa pasal anxiety pill tu
I think err tapi is susah to say ah that this is still moderate like I mean moderate I think is kalau nak cakap apa um penyakit yang bila atau paling terhangat kan like you know heat at the peak right moderate lah is should say I think anything more than this um
I think anything more than this kena redha lah
compared to the past tiga hari lalu lah yang
tapi dia ni memang dari dulu selalu apa bila dia bila orang dekat dengan kita orang apa go nak pergi dia kan selalu at her top
um tak tak senang lah reckless lah lepas tu ah apa terkebil-kebil mata dia kan
tapi nenek timid timid kemarahan dia tahap singa
eh hari tu ambil test yang dapat test dementia tak
ah tapi macam mana sebab test dia kelakar kelakar tanya soalan kan
the dementia I pernah nampak ah like the test to do
um bila kita cakap pasal dementia kita pernah nampak test dia apa um dulu dekat tempat kerja sekarang kena buat dia tapi nama test abbreviated mental test or something
A&T kan then apa macam ada dia orang cakap kat situ I tell you the number one nine seven two
huh what is it ah actually you are supposed to go and get her like tested that like for five years ago like when it was at the peak of the light where she keep asking is it already azan is it time to pray is you already azan then you can get their diagnoses which is at the mild stage because right now already at the moderate right
it is there's some like the guidelines to ah diagnose mental conditions susah like it is continuous assessment because ah apa
doctor cakap macam okay dah dia ni he show like five out ah like out of ten he show eight sign then ya diagnosed with dementia or depression but then apa
doesn't mean just depression kadang-kadang kalau dia datang enam bulan later sekali I am very depressed but I can hear voices in my head telling me to jump down
ah tu dah schizophrenia tu but then you see is like mental condition is terlalu susah cause
it's continuous assessment that's why dementia you'd all these mental condition you get diagnosed early you are follow up by doctor psychiatrist early like continuously so they know they see a progression dia ni oh dia ni dah tukar dah lain
just depression kadang-kadang datang enam bulan later sekali
tapi memang dah ada dah lama pun dia orang abandon yang dekat malaysia pun dia orang hantar apa mak dia orang sebab nursing home dekat situ lagi murah then but you cannot blame lah dia orang kerja apa mana ada orang ada time nak jaga mak bapa kat rumah it's like
tapi kalau kita tengok dalam islam kan macam mana
I think kalau you nak ikut yang orang europe punya is that kita first of all kita singapore tak ada space tapi kalau ada space kita boleh buat tapi dia orang buat dia orang tak buat nursing home dia orang buat macam nursing bilik you know
a nursing home right is very strict like you have to be inside there are because they don't have the manpower to bring you out and even if you can go out err is very risky because later nanti anak dia orang datang complain eh why you let my mother my father go out ah ah you know
mak bapa dia orang yang like oh people who stay at their already they also frustrated they also want to go out okay imagine it's like you've been living your life up the whole life in a certain way out of sudden your place in this new environment lepas tu dia orang macam you want to
quote and be be scold or something also like that right pun tak boleh because apa
family members isn't that in singapore if we don't use it have enough resource kita tak ada banyak kebolehan untuk like build something from scratch start from ground zero we have no space and then it's like
our only resource kita punya apa kita ada is ah hasil kita is orang you know we only have people that I would like crops like that that we can export and import so that's why like
you know those uh I think last time your late aunty ah arwah tu dia duduk situ
you mean senior activities macam tu
but if you have to understand sebab kalau dia orang keluarkan I think banyak sangat orang nak literally like rental flats are never enough in singapore
but um apa
macam that time yang for hundred dollar COVID fund tu orang ambil advantage
tu lah
for like the elderly right is you in okay maybe not in singapore because I'm mean in singapore but why doubt popular another reason is orang dah tua orang nak pergi masjid nak pergi temple nak pergi church
you ada that club house especially as senior activity centre it doesn't appeal do you know that that clubhouse one session can facilitate up to thirty maximum sixty lah if the centre is really big
ya so it's like there are people who have to go every everyday because they are alone and very at risk tapi for those yang habis bad manpower is in low you know like if there's not enough space so macam
and not in the activities to appeal to everyone tak tak semua orang nak karaoke tak semua orang nak colour tak semua orang nak main mahjong ada orang nak pergi church nak pergi solat you know nak pergi prayer nak pergi temple so it's like
they should be away like for it to integrate um the spiritual part plus the active aging but it's just that dekat singapore is black kita neutral kan kita apa
um kita apa macam mana nak cakap apa tu yang
ah kita tak nak emphasize right that kind of thing you know and then
so because of that it is not about how I should say are very highly encouraging play a country to practice your religion first that if tapi kita kena buat moderately kita tak boleh over of course lah kita tak nak extremist kan kita nak be good to our neighbours
it every individual tahap um how religious they are tahap dia punya iman it's more like eat in the bowl
so bila you nak bawa orang orang ni cakap okay ah siapa nak pergi mall nak buat you know macam kalau let's say dia orang taruk rental flat like one of the benefit atau studio apartment eh what are the benefit is boleh buat pergi church temple and
um mosque mosque this mosque lepas tu ah church let's say is a catholic church then ah
but I didn't tinggalkan dia seorang seorang
so I I wanted that I'm not so keen but I'm not so sure about how it will pan out like because I'm not raised in the environment you know I'm raised in like nenek dekat rumah
um how to say ah macam nenek kat rumah so I am not the one that go out to seek my to accompany my elders my elders is the one that um my elders is the one that come ah
anything with me if with my family right so it's like you know that that the dynamic is already different dia punya um relationship is different so
macam mana nak cakap eh I I think it's not that I'm not keen maybe it's the fear of the unknown because I'm not used to it mah so it's like I'm I don't know how will it
um I feel sad also macam budak-budak kecil budak-budak secondary school yang macam dia orang nak duduk dekat rumah dalam bilik dia orang because they are because they are the oldest one
then dia orang nak kena sacrifice nak kena pergi rumah nenek
apa ah for those elder grandkids who have been tasked to take care of the grandparents to accompany I think um the parents should the parents themselves should naturally let it flow you know
oh semalam ada cakap kan the discussion dari kecil is what is important how you didik and show right um
kalau you tunjuk dia orang that oh you have to go you monday is usually is me feel like alamak this is a task this is a task
ah because once it becomes a task it becomes a chore nanti macam tak happy then ya but you know you can never know even though they are your kids they are still human beings you made me me like what they are actually very happy with the idea because for me it be like
why didn't you do lah bila kita nak kena pergi
ke apa kita tak nak pergi sebab apa oh cannot cannot I need to take care of my grandma if my friend ajak me go out nak keluar oh sorry sorry tak boleh tak boleh need to take care of my grandma you know like is it for me nenek dah kat rumah it convenient
ya it is a team effort macam mana dekat nursing home ada satu orang satu orang jer ada tiga orang
ya but so jadi ke masa cakap apalah kebaikan apalah sebaliknya jaga penjagaan like you all this tanya right dah tak cabaran lagi lah so it's just a learning experience
tadi mak cakap yang apa jaga nenek baru dapat tahu macam mana nak lain kali in the future macam mana mak nak dijaga don't you think that is the reward don't you think that is the syurga
is that you have to always selalu
be prepared to tukar mindset
tukar mindset
it's like macam mana nak cakap eh if metaphorically is if you put it in a
you can ah whatever makin turun makin turun kalau you tukar your you will say okay I'm trying to swim now okay swimming doesn't work okay let me take a path I let me do some breathing exercises that me just tried to float for a while you know
swimming you are trying to get to where you want to go you get a cramp in your leg and then there is like you know you patah balik patah balik right kadang-kadang like it can be like
it three weeks of peaceful snipping all of a sudden one day it is ah again ya and apa that sucks lah because
apa kita selalu um try our best too you oo kita nak beritahu mak kita jumpa kawan kita hari tu imagine eh kalau
and dia cakap lecturer dia is ah mak dia pun ada dementia she's the main caregiver lah okay you when even a lady who is teaching nursing who you would know is a pakar a professional in these right in having patience and kesabaran cause they take care kan
she also experiences ya she was experience caregiver stress that really affect her work so what my kawan bilang me was that
uh okay lah dia because dia ada background the towel the thick and jake's dump the limit jacket you should you hire professional you know they know what to do so her her tips and tricks is that the disrupt
the incident was um dia try her very very best untuk mak dia tak akan berak dan kencing anywhere
bila nak berak kan dan kencing I rasa dia ada strategi lah macam every one hour you bring every minute you bring you know that kind of thing she has already picked up the mothers are non-verbal cue err bila dia nak pergi berak nak pergi kencing dia cakap I try my very best I try so hard and it happen
siapa dia nak marah tu dia nak marah mak dia ke mak dia cannot help it kan dia nak marah diri dia ke dia ada choice all along ya so she like even like a I'm not sure whether nursing professionals or what lah but a professional who is teaching
it's like macam mana nak cakap eh ya like okay now I realise that even you doctor you nurse as you ni cuma you you also don't treat the patient twenty four seven
family yang dah ada history with that person and then like you they have a lot of emotional
attachment for nurses and practitioners they can always be like okay this is not working you try as so much with your client you try and like ask them work with then work with the family tapi kalau family do decide that one day
there is a professional boundary where you stop at like you will never go beyond it so like family there is no like is unconditional you selalu kena not not selalu kena actually you have to always be there what not what not
yet studied in that I guess especially in the asian society dementia is the terikut perangai lama jer perangai lamanya mana doktor tahu you know even like as much as you share with the doctor or my mother is like this like this like this
but doktor macam as much they are only able to do so much with the information you give tapi like I
think I had one someone I know right um dia punya mak dia tak nak makan kat rumah cakap makanan tu berpasir lah apalah a'ah macam tak suka kalau anak balik lagi so it's like instead of
sitting and eating that meal half an hour she takes four hours to finish that meal ah but did you know what actually what is the history is because she ya she stay in a different child's house now anak dia yang dulu duduk dengan dia ada dia ada bermampu lah
untuk bawa dia keluar makan tapi dementia makes you lose your ability to communicate right so dia tak tahu macam mana dia nak cakap yang dia nak makan kat luar
jadi cerita dia macam ni mm
dia cerita dia macam ni lah like
dementia is you can um jaga because you have heard stories fifteen years taking care but um it's your ability can you go through it or not and communicate they lose a lot of things they lose communication they lose their memory they lose their ability so
yup so it's very important to communicate with your family members because walaupun jaga dementia ke tak bila dah nak tua like mak cakap the blessing in all of this is that you know next time how you want to be taken care of macam mana mak nak dijaga jadi mak tahu mak nak cakap dengan anak-anak mak so bila nak cakap dengan anak-anak mak sekarang
because I started a business selling tahu begedil selling tahu begedil yes
basically because I like to eat tahu begedil
um quite recently eh ah like last month ah late last month when tahu begedil was was like a trend
um tahu begedil and they both
apa tu macam ada lah dia punya kesedapan tu kan ya
for a while because ibu force me to
but um making this tahu begedil of course I only started recently
um eh I mean there were no macam kedai taking any orders so like I decide just to do myself
so I think ah this tahu begedil I will only sell bila ada time lah macam holidays
so maybe like maybe the next week is not tahu begedil it's like
oh I didn't call I didn't name it but ibu and abang named it as
bawal yes tudung bawal you know there's square scarf
um one is the our cotton bawal and another is our satin silk
matte satin silk bawal and our cotton bawal it sells
kita suka try benda like try to do things new things and we try to ya lah
we hustle a lot macam tak kesah ah kalau hari-hari kerja
asalkan like kita boleh rasa duit tu ah
ah inshallah wah untuk ah benda yang halal
oh like mati macam melayu
apa tu open casting for new models
like tak suka ambil gambar and I don't feel like I was pretty to become a model a hijabi model
so I was a bit stupid at that point of time no I I didn't simpan because the quality is like shit
and then I come back with just a piece of tudung for me it's like merepek so
ibu um
apa ni um shops coming to you uh for shooting she said then okay lah I start from fifteen dollars now I charge fifty per hour
people also come to me um to do to create apa to help their business boost by doing marketing and video edits
I don't know whatever barang that the company gave with plus money and then they just look pretty on it
because I've tried uh an influencer before to boost start my um Kamash um the tudung brand
apa tu our
to the company first let them approve apa-apa macam if they want to change they can change and then then we just write it up some people ah macam tambah-tambah lah ah themselves and then they
then they send back to us then baru kita copy paste and then put
selling clothes selling muslimah clothes but of course not those you know typical those resellers or whatever it's just like
macam ah you need to do your research err do survey do prototype everything
um sellers terdahulu biasa about apa yang dorang suka instead of what
you get what I mean macam they
assume that orh aku suka ni so confirm orang lain akan suka
pasal um a lot of people say eh ni lawa confirm ada orang suka confirm ada orang suka but we cannot hear what our family members really um say we need to reach out to people
ya one mistake is I listen to my partner's mum ah she said like orh ni colour cantik everything whatever shit
but then actually salah ah it's not selling our first
simple macam not too flashy can be an everyday wear so our first collection was successful tapi a lot of people was doubting like especially families were doubting
like eh eh ni mana ada orang pakai cotton lagi kan panas kan panas but it sell out like a lot um we bought I'm ten colours
bila dah membesar right sambil membesar
ya sambil nak membesar tu kita selalu tukar-tukar tau apa kita nak jadi apa kita suka
I love debating a lot ya I love debating and then ibu tak suka so like okay then I say I told her I want to be a nurse
um she said oh you know um macam she tell told me all the negative things lah all the
it's like jaga mayat jaga mayat and then like
but of course ibu also tak kasi because she say I will mati cepat the I'm like kalau ajal tu ada mati lah I mean like we cannot
macam mana nak cakap eh like
technically this what I'm doing right now fashion design is what ibu wants me to do lah
is the hantu remember
ya show I've been too because it's like so nice and it's mix of scary because I was little masih kecil kan that time
uh apa tu um aku rugi lah mm mm
obviously tahu begedil I I can eat that every day then after that I always doubt myself like oh I need to to control myself because
dah lama nanti aku aku juga jadi santau bagedil kan
tak okay aku tak boleh tak makan but if I can
apa seh
even if people bila
silat ya but then we stop because like um
the penjuru is it the guru the head of the silat or something like that I don't know what what they call him
he campur with
benda tak elok lah um with
jin yes
no sister his sister yang ini kat luar I it was at sengkang it was at sengkang you know those macam got court badminton court ya we silat there
one point of time macam tengah buat benda sendiri ah and then like
tapi like I saw this guru and this student like a teenage student
um tengah terbaring tau
the guru is like macam gitu macam baca-baca then I'm like what the hell is this person doing like um like what macam dia sakit ke I don't know anything but then I heard that she was
he made that person rasuk lah katakan
one of our uncle also was in the same silat with us siapa tu ah ariff ah he quitted first and then we quit
I feel like is a traditional err okay um one thing I learned about silat while doing my research for my last time was
the their silat is actually
a'ah tekan
like how to say um okay selalunya sekarang orang kat luar kan dorang gaduh kan dia rembat jer tapi dulu masa orang melayu zaman dulu when they are in a battle
um they tunjuk respect to one another first and they you know buka bunga is where you show like oh are you ready
to silat then ya
ya macam gitu lah
last time they really gold the adat lah
various lah silat taekwando
as long as you belah after two weeks ah I don't mind
like being straightforward it's like just say lah like oh apa I don't like it like can you like pick pick the clothes up
like uh aku akan ambil macam angkat ah baju-baju kotor ni but some people see it as rude macam orh
uh so macam katakan kau tak nak aku sini ah aku kena buat semua benda ah kat rumah ni
ya the melayu so formal I cannot
ah no we only speak it when ada oral ke
with abang
biasanya with abang or ibu a bit lah macam gini lah like transition between english and malay but for hilah hundred percent english
ah I also don't know eh but um one of my friends like dia sekarang dalam uni and he is a
he major in journalist bahasa melayu lah so
language ya macam ada perkataan like tak pernah dengar and then like the whole sentence like what I don't even understand
so macam I feel like
bahasa melayu ni is not for today lah
orang dulu-dulu because orang dulu
macam bahasa baku kan
along the way people macam get lazier and they tend to shorten the words so instead of dekat kau kena
lima minit short tak apa lah

sekarang sekarang err tak hairan pasal apa sekarang pasal COVID jadi dia orang cakap takpe that's why I cakap I nak tolong you apa ah apply kan I punya grant kalau dapat kan boleh cover cover lah kalau ni buat ambil dapat seribu abeh abah kasih seribu abeh mengaji dapat seribu dah tiga ribu abeh kalau dapat lapan ratus lagi ah ni tambah-tambah boleh simpan-simpan sikit
oh ya itu pun one of the ya correct yang you buat ni pun bagus eh macam hujan eh
hujan eh a'ah lah hujan lah
ya betul betul tapi macam untuk ambil ni you rasa bagus tak
kalau kasih dia kasih empat ratus lebih tiga ratus lebih baru berapa hari baby daripada hari mana tau hari enam depan tau hari enam lepas ni hari baru berapa hari kira-kira enam hari
tak lah bukan november
oh jadi tak dapat lah dua puluh ni
lepas tu takkan nak kasih umi seribu lebih seh nanti kan dia orang mesti nak dapat fund tapi kalau umi cakap kalau umi buat ah fund satu bulan tu dia satu bulan pertama tu dia dapat dua ratus seratus tu dua ratus sekali bulan kedua dia dapat empat ratus
and lastly err the last wish that I want to have is to have the all the skills that I can attain in this world sebab bila you have all the skills you can impress people and people will also look up to you and with these skills also you you will feel good ah when you can do things yang orang lain semua tak boleh buat
mm pasal ilmu ni but dia ada banyak err rangkuman ilmu nak dapat semua ilmu memang tak boleh tapi hmm kalau dapat ni best ah pasal ilmu ni nak nak dapat susah sangat mm and bila dapat ilmu ni orang akan mencari awak untuk mendapatkan ilmu ni mm
so ini adalah yang tiga wishes yang saya nak mm so kita err what about you fathul
pasal banyak orang ada persepsi bahawa bila awak kaya awak akan boleh spend on whatever and what not and bila awak dapat spend whatever and what not then means err with every spending awak akan rasa this happiness
kononnya orang tu dia dah dia dah ada virus tu tapi dia yang teleport ke tempat lain so dia jadi the source of this err kuman lah so dia yang spread to others
dia tak dia tak tahu pasal dia tak dia tak tahu yang dia ada virus mm so I stay over this view whereby teleportation could actually increase
okay mungkin awak dah cakap ini okay maybe saya agree sikit
maybe awak ada point over there
tapi yang contact tracing tu mungkin tak tak senangkan lah
pasal orang sendiri tak ingat apa yang dia makan semalam ambil macam dia nak ingat mana dia teleport kalau dia sendiri dah suka teleport
mm tapi ini interesting point of view mm so kalau awak tanya saya apa superpower yang saya nak saya nak power of regeneration
so contohnya err jari saya terpotong ah nanti dia akan heal sendiri
saya rasa kononnya awaknya kaki dislocate ah dia regenerate sendiri
dah tahu hidup akan kurang satu hari tak kan nak buat benda yang merepek-merepek atau benda yang high risk
itu meminta kematian lah
think of living in isolation uh maybe one maybe satu hari bila dah dah experienced everything yang kita nak ah
okay mungkin apa yang awak cakap telah mengubah persepsi saya and betul lah yang apa awak cakap yang kita kena
sebab tanpa kita bergaul dengan orang we will never know what they face
so for example bila kita tahu orang ini menghadapi masalah ini tapi kita nak tolong so kita akan mencari solution untuk menolong seseorang itu
so mungkin apa awak cakap err betul juga ah and tapi bila awak err saya
hmm hairan lah kenapa awak err question bila seseorang itu nak isolate maybe for months
his child behind then anak-anak dia akan merana ah and
kalau months okay months maybe saya rasa maksimum err maybe not more than nine months ah
lesser than that mungkin okay
kenapa nine months sebab within this nine months um budak tu dia akan grow and after this nine months
okay soalan tu interesting sepuluh tahun means sebelas tahun yang lalu
sebelas tahun yang lalu okay saya definitely akan suruh diri saya err ini ah invest ah invest in bitcoin
sebab at umur ten years old memang awak cakap betul uh nak nak faham tentang certain barang memang susah tapi bila kita dapat convince ah
satu orang ni at ten years old dia akan ingat
and maybe along the way mungkin dia dah dua belas tahun tiga belas and then dia akan start
err thinking back err apa yang orang itu cakap betul ke tak
ah adakah orang orang tu dia yang ada bilang saya ten years bila saya ten-year-old akan betul
so mungkin yang barang-barang begini semua akan err um akan interest awak ah pasal maybe one day juga awak akan jadi famous because of this ah
err some luck you managed to stay alive ah so for you err apa yang experience awak pernah mengalami yang awak lagi sikit menghadapi kematian
I need to add on apa awak cakap memang betul biar kena maki jangan mati
it happens whereby we have to train where err train our capsizing skill so we have to capsize this is done intentionally intentionally so kita orang kena capsize habis tu bila capsize ini kita kena grab kawan kita punya kayak
and get back up ah so bila saya tengah practice capsize ini
instructor jauh so kita jauh daripada semua orang
habis tu kita bila saya tengah capsize kawan saya dia lose control of dia punya kayak habis saya dah kat dalam air ni saya dah capsize terus saya tap saya punya kayak
bila saya tengok terbalik ini so kawan saya punya bot tak ada
saya dekat situ saya stuck ah saya nak nak keluarkan yang kita orang ada skirt skirt ini akan prevent water from entering our kayak
nak keluarkan skirt tu kena ketat dan saya tak tak boleh keluarkan saya cuba cuba cuba tak boleh so saya tap kuat-kuat
tap kuat-kuat uh in hope that kawan saya dengar saya ah pasal saya tengah dekat
dia tak dia punya dia tak lihat saya saya dekat belakang dia saya sedang pegang kayak dia so saya tap tap tap dia tak dengar alright bila dia dengar ini dia kata ah lepas incident dia cuba paddle tapi I tolak dia so dia nak paddle susah sikit
so saya dekat bawah air maybe for one minute ah

the first one was too tight ya that one that one was too tight but okay ah the rest all fine so okay ah apa-apa ah
the other side will be like uh oh no I want this one ah eh you cannot I plan already mah so it's like that you end up quarrelling for nothing just before husband and wife so this this so I don't want so when you think eh want to get married it's not going to be uh sudden just that are you okay if you want to get married to me then after that we plan later lah nanti dulu berbual so sekarang kita go dulu then kalau later part then we can plan lepas tu buat plan K uh getting a house settle down where to stay maybe mother mother's in-law side or your mother's side you see or not sometime you get married you got no house mah
so that's for me it's very simple I don't like macam you know lah to me a rocket go to the moon how to plan that thing no need no need no need no no no no I'm not I'm not very detail so as long as happy to see
yang kat mana where at where
why because it really trigger my nerve you know what when you want to do kad jemputan it's a wedding card ah eh so when want to do kad jemputan it's like

that guy flew it's very uh macam yang macam dia dah enal lama ah but alhamdulillah macam he can talk to me we are not awkward all the time ya that's the that's the best part of him ah there are also not not like uh apa uh retrovert eh
in okay so I was not like macam pendiam or what something like that so
I talk to him macam
macam dah kenal lama ah ya correct that guy is is is is cool
that guy is cool very very cheerful funny guy ya better than I think that's better than our last time yang yang supposed to be there right ya
we are maybe kita nak buat lagi ah
I think better we do because maybe that time macam tak prepare and by the way yang pasal kahwin ni video ni ya of course but we can make it one more round just for a video of us lah better kan
ada kat google my I think I'm my punya google photo ada berapa banyak gambar kita all this you can make it uh as a oh ya ya ya yes
the wedding eh okay the wedding regret tak pasal I as a guy guy's side eh wedding is just dia macam slide tau
they have no bumpy ride you know no need to engage gear apa gear sekarang we just like cukup time habis kita tak ada macam apa eh eh uh kita punya tanjak okay tak kita punya keris senget tak tak ada tak ada tak ada we don't we just cukup time
halal that is what I want dia tak ada macam eh
kasut kasut ketat tak tak ada tak ada tak ada I don't I don't I don't have think of that cause that time for
tak payah fikir sangat ya
the best part dia punya hari tak hujan tu jer for me it's the weather ah for me for it uh dia punya for me is the weather I cuaca dia yes correct
macam dia tak susah nak dapat tu weather that time out of what january eh month of january right dia dia macam tak nak kata panas tak boleh tau pasal I'm very stable outdoor tau dia kat luar
uh okay tempat dia okay just under void deck juga kan uh kita ambil kat void deck kita book void deck so kita plan nak booking void deck malaysia dia tak ada ada ada orang book kan they're taking up other events something like that it's very dia punya port dah okay tau so one thing's uh kita dah book then apa lagi
about the ada ada water utilities right you have to go something like that and everything uh under under that lah so make sure yang siapa yang nak kahwin uh kat you know void deck ke apa kan make sure you do your planning well I'm talking about the place ah ya
kan oh really kenapa eh
kenapa eh
for how many pack berapa orang dia eh okay
oh macam the brides woman jadi batman eh
mm lima puluh eh oh tak I think dua
three tiga tu tiga oh tiga eh uh first mm
slow down the process macam macam mana
maybe along the way they boleh buat photoshoot kan dalam kereta ke apa something like that tak eh
selit sikit lah tak ada selit
oh why kenapa
actually yang pasal your makcik tu dia memang cari pasal lah ya correct why why kenapa dia buat kenapa dia nak cakap macam tu kat depan mak you kan habis what your mum apa ada dua anak jer patut kena cakap balik
oh apa asal ha a bit
okay wedding eh kena uh nak uh apa uh dia dengan kompang tu
kan that time wow that time I macam ada crusader datang tapi tu semua dah plan lah so I cannot use my proceed kompang macam macam lain-lain team pula kalau tak I smile I tak ada uh plan but it goes well
sometimes it doesn't plan well it doesn't plan before but it goes well so it's like it's like macam cool lah eh tak tak
tak cakap pun ni semua jadi sendiri eh I was like happy ah my brother was there uh my adik was there with me dia dia yang plan macam mana dia punya line up so I was uh wow that's my first time tau I tak macam prepare all this eh asal my brother know ah ah that time ya brothers are quite okay lah my best man there that time
okay so uh kompang the the luckiest I mean the best part is the kompang weather and I also uh when I came to the pelamin then I saw you there sitting
then uh that's where I meet my wife and mak andam dia cover muka dia everything like that something like that tapi ada ada hadang eh
quite fun lah but that time tak ada macam rabak punya pakai apa uh padlock ke apa nak pecahkan kunci tak ada ah but just that dia very straightforward yes
and dapat tahu siapa more yang I dah kenal kenal lah yang tak kenal tu uh kat sana baru kenal tahu macam eh quite cool juga eh I mean of course the yang paling bising pun ada
of course they are part I think I think I think your family side is the loudest and have had have more uh fun there ah quite lucky you know actually it's throughout is the families getting to know each other I mean mak dia also apa welcoming me as a new guy in the family ya
tapi kita tak boleh buat like second round dua round tiga round tak boleh the best part
talking about the ballroom let's say ah you want to go to the what orange ballroom kita tak boleh makan ke
dah jalan dah kahwin if can rewind something like that ya
okay I first thing is sad one thing is happy okay the sad part the the wedding is over and it turn actually it turn out well lah okay and dia tak ada macam problem macam power trip ke apa tak ada it just went well so the event
dah habis kan so kita dah
dah apa dah stand down everything then
not say happy but I'm very like macam uh conscious ah what where to step everything it's not like macam wah this another episode it must be a difficulty at anywhere and at any corner will come
so what I'm I'm telling myself okay so kita then I think banyak tengok movie ah or drama orang-orang kahwin semua macam ni everything macam mana how dia dia dia plan dia rely on everything so nak recalled that back dia then kena ikut cerita apa dah jadi movie or drama dia jadi you know but I want to be my own drama
I want to be my own so I cannot tell them eh apa nak buat next ah siapa nak tanya my father or my mother or wherever yang dah pernah kahwin eh apa nak buat next ah it's like kental ah so I'm a man now I don't care so now you got own you got own way so you have it's a fun life ah
whether you what you want it to be so you nak macam mana you just create yourself until now I'm still creating so as a husband I as a husband
I'm talking for myself right uh I want to be very thrill I mean not really straight ah kadang-kadang corner a bit so you know ah you know the road well dia tak ada macam uh always straight jer ada ya lah kadang-kadang kita straight pun
boring apa straight road mesti ada corner left a bit sharp turn all these ah play along lah so how you handle okay first thing
uh that is me I cannot handle my wife if you if you can't handle me what I mean myself so this what I'm trying to say that kita if you handle myself unless you can handle anyone else so it's like that
so dah kahwin then uh ya then I rest at home
okay then don't play play anymore tak boleh macam berfoya-foya something like macam uh go anyhow and then I ask permission for my wife pasal kita dah kahwin sekarang kita tak boleh macam hanky-panky dulu bujang lain tak apa
we lepak bawah bawah block apa semua mak mak tak kisah so mak abah semua tak ali bila nak balik uh kau layan phone jer sekarang kalau wife lain tau dia tanya on the spot nak kena respond
dua missed call game
kiranya macam you're asking for trouble lah I know something will break or what itu eh wife punya side but dulu tak ah so this what is a discipline ah so you have to be more not say matured more discipline and care your wife be accompany with her so that everything goes well actually when I think ah
the more I care about my wife eh the more things I get you know like macam you there's something you return well lah something you don't know what is that but something you return you return well just nicely macam tak cakap dia dah fikir dulu tau ah something like that something like that if you if you think that way ah for me lah now right now that's one thing I like about her
if you give in she will also give back so fair lah ah for me it's fair if you now I don't have any like lepak dengan kawan tau dia tak macam call turun lepak lima lima empat pagi unless work lah unless work tu pun nasib dia punya
so ada lah sikit
uh not dia tak sama tapi serupa lah okay so pasal uh travelling eh okay start from travelling okay I as in start from our honeymoon lah the that is the starting of we how we can be linked
so there's no other dia tak ada pergi tempat lain tau macam long distance that time nak go mana ah pergi mana cambodia eh huh that time was the last time so I don't know that passport dah habis pasal I not a travelling guy
so bila part nak pergi honeymoon tu I using that passport lah yang lama tu then sampai airport
that time I thought my wife eh then kita baru kahwin kan so I thought she will get angry and shocked the whole airport can hear her voice but she relax already
dia tak marah dia just cakap aja alamak it's just I know that she's very disappointed you know
tapi dia tak expose dia punya marah tu kat airport so we plan that was macam I literally divert tau pergi malaysia
and then at malaysia passport I my passport lepas so dia kata can pass through ah my wife pergi book every yang mana yang nak pergi so that part eh she really a hardcore dia boleh book
so kita pergi mana dulu ah cameron highland first baru drop to cameron highland and port dickson so meaning we go three places lah eh under under malaysia state
I quite weird we having fun there lah it took part it's not it's not about malaysia you know it's the how we make that happen until now that's the best somehow eh kita nak pergi ah somewhere like macam uh korea ke itu kita plan apa kita nak plan plan plan sampai pergi tapi ini tak tau dia nak pergi bandung dulu nak pergi bandung then airport uh then passport dia habis uh mati then lepas tu kita dapat tahu kita pergi tempat lain and that was not planned
mm so kita ramp
that time so I have to drive lah so then I think my wife my wife should realise lah until now eh I'm a good driver not punishment it's just that dia tahu tau eh my husband can you know something not something fall
someone can can bring up back macam I tak cakap eh awak I cannot drive lah malam ni
no no no no I will fork out I will fork out something you've resolved eh macam
masuk mati ke I've tried to make something better lah so that's why my driving skill come in about that time dia dah I dah drive dah berapa kali ah eh
so I got you're saying that I I I I got uh someone that yang macam
travels dengan parents tak ada boyfriend ya you see eh you can hear that or not tak ada boyfriend that will make I'm the guy okay so
so something lesson learned lah sometime kalau kita pergi bandung pun it's a one way trip dia tak pergi mana-mana tempat pun whereas kalau kat malaysia ni kita pergi macam
a few places lah banyak oh ada juga eh oh
by okay by the way kan uh insyaallah kalau abang you ada duduk sana all right
dia punya menyesal tu takde lah
pasal I I choose this what
so how you can say regret no no no no not not really lah if something like macam benda yang eh kalau tahu buat ni takde takde it just went well if I plan if I say that now
if I know I being I do that now macam sekarang kan baru nak menyesal then we're going backward
so tu yang best lah macam
marriage sekarang ni ke apa oh okay
of course kan masa tu berselerak lah
I I scared I takut bila kalau my wife dia
uh suruh buat ni suruh buat tu uh tak boleh tidur rumah I tak tengok mak I something like that lah kena very like macam doesn't goes well lah once ada ah I don't like kadang-kadang kan ada orang kahwin dia straightaway eh
kat dia punya in-law jer
I don't know mungkin dia takde can nak tengok adik sendiri for me I I don't have that my wife give me freedom to go play especially
see my wife jalan-jalan makan dengan dia orang semua ya my wife is very fair very fair so we have this uh fairness lah ha so vice versa if for me kalau apa yang dia buat tu tak salah kan dalam segi undang-undang and dengan undang-undang agama then why not just try lah so try something new cause dia try something new ni kadang-kadang dia tak boleh macam
macam lama punya style jer so kita nak kena understand kita dah apa dah zaman ni sekarang kan zaman sekarang ni kita
a lot of things all or way we can uh do business ke apa ke so you have to try it out
bersyukur sekarang ni dah dia punya takde macam apa selisih faham lah
try to be more okay dia I think ah okay my wife dia nak ambil lesen tau okay I know this lesson we will take one or two years maybe or months only but
kalau dia drive tu I think she can bring me anywhere lah might be it's her turn after five years I bring eh another five years is her turn lah
dia punya turn so hopefully kalau dia dapat drive kan untuk suami suami dia ni yang very cute ni also cute you know I'm very cute also and of course ah ya so hopefully that's my request mah and drive me anywhere
I like I like her cooking until now no failure especially my recipes I just left my recipes recently there's I just finish ah so she cook for me every night shift so that's the best part day shift pun sama yes
I like her cooking actually uh she can cook well better than me ah that part I cannot take ah they cannot part they cannot challenge thank you sayang
oh sekejap jer kan rasa dah dua ribu dua puluh satu dah
kan dia macam january february march december terus
tu ah
target berapa target
wow eh tapi kan khairul aming buat kan fifteen dua bulan tau ah tak dia memang dia memang makan sihat eat clean and he did skipping like for every day
ah but memang kak long vegetarian kot of course you can do it
mm menarik menarik
of course I have a lot tapi kita kena prioritise lah kan mana yang for this year and nanti next next year kita buat lagi yang lain kan
okay before this rasa boleh survive lima ratus sebulan sekarang gaji pun tak cukup untuk survive bulan-bulan so plan resolution untuk dua ribu dua puluh satu adalah untuk
mm make my own business uh untuk for side income lah part time lah part time for fun
mm ada two things actually which is dah started dah pun ah macam tu tapi kita
kita slow slow lah menapak kita punya business kan first uh untuk buat surprise delivery
sebenarnya kan nak buat surprise delivery ni I tak rasa pun nak buat
dia bukannya more to untuk duit tau it is just that I feel happy to see people happy
faham ke ha macam pergi delivery pergi pergi buat delivery kat orang nanti orang tu surprise eh dapat happy dapat surprise gitu kan macam seronoknya macam tu lah lagi satu the
the other part yang best sebab selepas delivery ini adalah bila kita
pack surprise tu kan so kalau orang tu order nak ni ni ni kita pack dia punya surprise box tu kan bila pack tu rasa macam
uh we pour love in that box faham ke
boleh customise lah sebab kita tak nak macam idea macam mana eh kita nak every gift tu comes with thought
orang tu sendiri fikir dia nak bagi hadiah apa bukannya dia dia bagi bulat-bulat kat kita oh okay uh I nak set A dah let's say macam tu kan which is set A dia memang kita dah provide
then it dia macam tak comes from heart truly tau ha
ha kita macam gift creator lah macam tu
everything is possible apa jer orang tu nak kita akan make it happen kan
end of november tahun lepas kot start
ah ada dua customer and more to come
hmm betul
then satu bila macam selalunya kita surprise delivery orang yang order surprise delivery ni orang yang tak boleh nak pergi hantar sendiri
so dia part oh part yang orang tu pergi hantar part tu dah tak ada tau untuk orang tu bagi dekat but macam nice ah kita nak bagi kat orang kan
so part yang kita pergi hantar barang tu dah tak ada which is dalam surprise tu satu part tu dah tak ada kita tolong buatkan that's why customisation tu penting maksudnya orang yang nak bagi hadiah tu
dia memang gift put in thoughts dalam apa yang dia nak bagi orang tu walaupun dia tak boleh hantar sendiri tapi thoughts tu ada ah
a'ah dia bukan the for the sake of just giving but giving with means lah macam tu
nama dia kotak riang okay boleh search kat Instagram pada kotak riang okay
yes that's right tu satu second is
err ni macam baru jer start like semalam first of january err a'ah but err this one
tak tak tak buat sendiri lah just drop ship barang orang lah kan err nak jual healthy food
uh dia uh makanan-makanan yang orang yang nak diet orang yang nak sihat cari faham ke
dia sugar free punya products ah
ah betul macam apa konjac mee tu kan
yes yes ada ada err antara barang yang angah drop ship
yang no sugar
but it taste like the real peanut butter ada peanut butter ada almond butter chocolate yang macam Nutella pun ada
but semua yup sugar free
okay so next next ada resolution ada
I think that's good and actually cakap pasal nak
betul and it's not something wrong pun
betul and it give benefits to other people as well
betul kita pun Google dulu
mmhmm kan selain daripada save money maybe you can gain some money as well mm mm
yes dah it's two thousand and twenty one healthy and rich
ya as in dia kan dia macam ni tau err plot twist dia maksudnya ya I have everything in plan but I want all my plan to be plot twisted in a good way maybe I have I have expectation at eighty percent maybe
ah ada ada
entah lah resolution ni
main sukan lah berdebat lah apa semua kan so it was very interesting life
interesting as well because I have my own money kan very interesting tapi
come back at home like for six and then at ten dah kelat sebab penat and that is very non healthy lifestyle for me lah so in twenty twenty one my resolution is to have
no no that's not the I want some me time yang can benefit myself as well bukan macam me time just leisure time lepak-lepak tak ada tak ada
a'ah betul dulu ingatkan abah kan main guitar kan then semua anak-anak abah ni kan angah sorang jer yang
ada keinginan nak main guitar kecil-kecil dulu kan
so I yes darjah darjah enam kat kedah dulu
mm menarik a'ah betul
mmhmm ye betul
ya uh huh tu clarinet clarinet tu ni lah ah betul lah squidward
something yang dah ada base eh
ada satu yang angah teringin nak err enroll in mandarin class a'ah I don't know ah I think I really I really have strong interest in language
betul lah I I really learn to love new language I think mandarin err is my choice right now because
apa dia a'ah
ah tengok
mm betul tiba-tiba dah berjaya
and one more thing I think macam macam kak long kata lah belum kaya lagi kan but in the process in the journey sepanjang-panjang nak jadi kaya tu
you actually contribute a lot to the society mm from the the fundraising that you made or daripada the job that you created for other people
you know those small small things actually walaupun tak kaya but it means a lot kan
mm betul
mmhmm betul
what is your advice for a startup macam angah
tapi cakap pasal start up tadi kan sampai sekarang tak puas hati lagi tau
han ji pyeong patut jadi hero
mmhmm betul
pasal dia dah bring the character tu
a'ah betul
betul lah tu tapi nam do san tu hais geram jer lah tengok
um ni macam very small small small thing tapi important lah
tak nak procrastinate ah
kan sebab itu lah punca kepada segala-galanya dua puluh dua puluh tak jadi faham ke kita bertangguh tangguh tangguh tangguh ha hapo pun takde
betul err and I agree that sometimes when we procrastinate actually the result turns out to be better faham ke macam like very last minute tapi it push us to to make a better thing faham ke ya that's true but
when it comes to working the the the that is quite hard lah actually faham ke sebab ya maybe maybe
so tahu lah kita ada deadline kan deadline is twentieth october lah konon kan but the boss want to see the progress bukannya on twenty nine tu I can do everything faham ke
yes betul
hmm tapi susah lah
the the algorithm dia mmhmm
a'ah eh tapi kadang-kadang kan bukan kita sebut tau benda kita fikir pun macam keluar juga
pelik kan angah rasa dia tanam chip lah
mm sometimes benda yang kak nor cakap dengan umi pun macam nak beli apa-apa benda tu keluar dekat angah ha
ya entah entah camera ni so scary
tapi kita pun sedar jer kan like the like kita punya that time ada yang kelat
memang terus scroll bawah sekali tick
internet internet ni they works in a very interesting way
live okay lagi ni some people err even make like house tour kot
I think I think that is very something that unacceptable to me lah maybe others think that it's for fun but for me it's like you are showing to people how to enter your house faham ke
dah lah mostly yang buat tu semua wealthy people
ah faham
but I think kan angah pernah dengar satu video ni
err actually kita boleh set for err ni for iPhone users lah kita boleh set set for one day how many hours that we spend ah bila kita dah exceed kan dia akan keluar notification that you have exceed the the total hours of err social media or something like that lah for today
hmm boleh boleh set dekat phone I think we can also keep track lah on that day how many how many time on the day how many time how many hours
ya we we are adults takkan nak ada parental control lagi
a'ah oh ye ah
eh seronok lah
eh orang nak tengok nak try ah
menarik ah
kan I think that this is how we would faham ke
kita akan more determined
if we can see what is the result faham ke kalau kita macam okay four hours nak concentrate kita tak dapat sebab kita tak nampak apa-apa kita tak boleh nak materialise benda tu tau
ha oh walaupun apps yang acknowledge pun it's enough
betul betul betul betul kan kita manusia memang mcam tu ah
ah apa dia
oi menarik
kadang-kadang kita nak tengok waktu pukul berapa sekali a'ah lepas a'ah betul
betul yes
that's correct anyway cakap pasal kucing tadi dah entah lah kucing ni kan diorang ni macam addictive eh
ya ikut suka hati dia
ya betul tak tak tahu lah kita bela kucing untuk apa sebenarnya
tak ada hati kan kadang-kadang kan kan kalau kita adopt kucing kan macam kita pergi adopt kucing kan tapi kan macam orang kata
it is not you who choose the cat the cat choose you faham ke
dah lah diorang selalu buat dumb things tapi kita still bela bagi makan
but they pee everywhere kenapa elegant
huh dia kan tidur terkangkang tengok kucing-kucing kita
that is very interesting kadang-kadang kan teringat kucing ni pun boleh gelak sendiri tau
angah terfikir satu benda but it's very random lah tapi something that angah memang selalu terfikir lah bayangkan lah kan kalau tiba-tiba
ada zombie apocalypse apa kita akan buat
tak sebenarnya kan zombie ni boleh jadi ke
ya betul
ah kat rumah a'ah
eh I think angah pernah sembang dengan kak long ke siapa dulu ke it is only my imagination but I think we have plan before that we want to sell zombie survival kit pernah tak kita ke itu imaginasi angah ada
uh huh macam cukup makan cukup first aid ah kan
oh it's not specifically for zombie lah tak beli ke a'ah
war ke mm mm
tapi kan cakap pasal bunker tadi angah terfikir lah kalau kalau kita buat rumah kan kita hire contractor
then the contractor will know everything about our house isn't that dangerous ke sometimes I would think that way lah macam okay kalau kita buat secret room then the contractor tu akan tahu secret room kita kat mana what if the contractor have bad intention
ah lepas tu ah faham aduhai
oh back to cat conversation cakap pasal cat ni kan diorang addictive
eh kalau kita pindah rumah baru kan I really want to build a catio for our cats
mm betul
ah that's what I was thinking about catio tu dekat hujung sekali depan tu swimming pool
so when we were swimming kita boleh hi kucing macam tu
and and sometimes I feel like I want them to swim with us as well boleh ke kucing boleh berenang ke
oh comelnya kalau kucing berenang
oh ye ke
steady boleh berenang ah
macam glasshouse lah kan cantiknya
and itu lah kita punya permulaan kepada segala-galanya tak ada harapan tak ada
perancangan so tak ada apa-apa kan takkan tiba-tiba terjadi selain ada pelan kan
siapa ramai tak percaya time tu
mm mm betul
cakap pasal cross country kan
kesian kan tengok ramai stewardess steward pilot yang laid off sekarang
mmhmm memang tak boleh langsung boleh lah but a few flights jer yang boleh pun sekarang
tapi tapi tapi pasal steward and stewardess ni kan ada cadangan untuk bawa
err steward and stewardess jadi macam helper lah ataupun additional staff dekat poly lah sebab diorang ada basic first aid punya basic ha
a'ah betul
kan a'ah sebab dia memang ada basic
betul mmhmm
pastu kebanyakan yang kena sack yang kena laid off
pun akan start business akan start buat business
because that's the fastest way untuk kita do something instead of waiting for jobs to come to you
employer pun tak semestinya nak ambil kerja dalam waktu sekarang
mmhmm betul
mmhmm betul
social yup betul betul
actually kan kalau tengok macam junior junior pun kan ada pun ramai yang
ya betul satu err satu sebab
jarang lah kita buat assignment sorang-sorang waktu dulu pun mesti discuss dengan kawan-kawan share jawapan like very very normal things to do kan tu satu second
our youth feeling faham ke
mm betul
ya lepas tu dah habis online learning
tiba-tiba graduate online then terus masuk kerja
then you will you ya we have to face a very hard life waktu kerja without your friends anymore
mmhmm experience pula
I think dekat china err they even built a academy for influencer kat china korea takyah cakap lah korea memang
itu memang like being famous is like
most of their punya ambitions lah ya being famous become actors actress dengan idol idol
tu lah tapi
budak-budak muda sekarang memang look up to
because artist ni orang akan minat dia sebab character yang dia bawa dalam drama character dia bawa dalam movie but influencer ni orang minat dia apa atas apa hidup dia faham ke so that's why people lagi look up to influencer daripada
mmhmm betul
eh apa kak long punya macam
for our family lah kan apa kak long punya resolution
mm dan angah rasa sejak kan sejak kita punya ni movement order ni angah rasa kita pun memang banya spend time
mm together sebagai satu family
I think same quite the same things juga lah
I want all of us to be involved together in everything that we do faham ke yes macam
main dengan kucing memasak ke
a'ah betul cantik-cantik
they can remind us satu lagi satu we want mm make them
we want we want to prove that we can do it to them faham ke macam angah cakap dengan kak long gini kan mesti angah rasa macam kena tunjuk ni boleh buat ah ah takkan cakap kosong jer
