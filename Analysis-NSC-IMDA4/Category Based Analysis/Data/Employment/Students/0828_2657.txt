guys [oh] my god ya ya ya that's like
pick me pick me pick me girls
we're not calling on anybody we're just saying you know
but (um)
ya it kinda sucks
you just need to find friends right
who are like there to like support you [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> like if you if you find like friends who are girls then <malay>macam</malay> they just want to like
befriend you so they can get to know like your best friend or something like that <malay>tu salah macam salah sikit</malay>
damn

<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] if like if like karma were to like be served to me I think it will be like
however I actually since we're on the topic of relationship it's however like I broke up with my exes will be like returned back to me like ten times fold because [kan] like my brother in law
<malay>dia cakap dengan aku</malay> like (uh) the way I
break up with people <malay>macam</malay> traumatising <malay>sikit</malay>
<malay>dia cakap macam sikit</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>

like revenge lucky revenge [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
like god just like you deserve it yup ya ya thanks god

[oh] okay for <malay>siapa</malay>
like for myself like for like anybody else [lah]

okay never mind I have (um)
(um) I guess
(um)
I guess my ex
I guess karma I don't know
I will give karma back to him [sia] like <malay>macam</malay>
because he was really misogynistic and really mean
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> like he will say [oh] girls like <malay>perempuan tak boleh buat ni</malay> [pe] <malay>kena ada lelaki semua</malay>

<malay>macam</malay> like you got nothing to prove
you got nothing to prove you got like nothing to your name and then you going to like tell me honey [a'ah]
<malay>aku rasa</malay> because right I realise
if <malay>macam</malay> like
like some guys [kan] <malay>macam</malay> them they try to over like try to be overconfident
<malay>sampai</malay>
just to cover up all their like insecurities which is like
no because [kan] like <malay>kalau dorang macam</malay> like they get into a relationship with you then <malay>dia rasa macam</malay> okay
subconsciously <malay>dorang macam</malay> project their insecurities on to you
then they like if they see you talking to another person who like apparently does not fit
(um) does it's like whatever they are lacking then <malay>dorang macam</malay> insecure <malay>gila babi</malay> then they like [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> I cannot
and then they will like get angry at you for no reason
that's not that's not what we're here for
(um) <malay>tapi</malay> like confidence is good like in a person <malay>tapi macam tapi</malay> [kan] if you're like too overconfident then you are just <malay>macam</malay> hiding something then it should it like you're hiding something to the extent where you are actually projecting your insecurities on other people so please get therapy
please get therapy ya please get help because <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> I don't like the fact that <malay>macam</malay> some guys <malay>ada</malay>
temper issues
because <malay>dorang macam</malay> live so <malay>macam</malay> insecure because of like maybe what somebody else <malay>cakap dengan</malay> them or like something that somebody criticise them or whatever and then suddenly they are like insecure for their entire life and then they like project it on to you and then now suddenly using that and then fuelling that anger and then they are like I'm angry at you because somebody said that I'm not tall enough something like that [kan] [a'ah]

okay but is it me and like what did I do
like
(um) but when you think about it [kan] like it's all the boomer generation all the previous generation [kan] actually created a society that is so toxic that it makes our generation difficult to process it all because we have a lot of trauma that has been passed down
from these previous generations so I don't know about you but can we blame can we blame the millennials
and can we blame the boomers for traumatising us yes thank you very much ya no like they claim
like a workplace environment where it's like
(um) I need you to
I need you to value work and only work and I need you to do all of this for work I need to live breathe work but then [kan]
it's like it's so taxing on the mind that you don't even have like time to like breathe chill you don't like even in school right
like there is no chill you you have like (um) everyday you always got an assignment to do and then you are so like it's so
built up that you are just like when am I ever going to finish this
but like of course these people who already got their doctorates from like nineteen fifty two <malay>dorang macam</malay> !aiya! I did it before you can confirm do [one]
ya like I didn't I don't know about you but back in like nineteen seventy eight I'm sure you only had like what twenty students in your class where there was no competition and then there was like no not much (um) things to learn but like hello we're in twenty twenty where everything is advanced and you are expected to know all this things that you were still trying to figure out back in the eighties so I don't know about you can you like take a chill pill give me a break or something you know
have a break have a kit kat
I didn't know why I went off why did I go off
ya
ya
ya ya
whatever
ya
it's a very difficult time
ya but but right okay (um) so singapore always says like hi it's a very difficult time so like if you need if you need (um) help please go find it and then they like give you <malay>macam</malay> like all this like hotlines to call if you're having like anxiety having depression blah blah blah
content warning but [kan] it's like
but [kan] but [kan] like at work they are just like (err) ya I need you to do this by like monday and it's like friday and I'm like okay okay so like you don't really care about my mental health anymore
because you're stressing me out bro ya ya ya they as like
like that's how it is at school so so
for work it actually happen because my
client
one of my clients is like she she had like a meeting at ten [eh] ten
ten until one and then she's like and then she has to like get this work done by like (um)
by monday and it was a friday so she had to like to rush it through and I'm like
ya
I tell you it's cut throat
that's why otherwise <malay>macam</malay>
ya ya ya I guess timezone but
you making me rush
bro <malay>tak boleh</malay> #lek# #lek# [pe]
it's just me complaining
don't worry about it just complain king okay complain queen okay

please
please don't report me
ya ya ya
ya
[kan] <malay>macam</malay> like stop demonising tattoos or like <malay>macam</malay> or like piercings
like body modifications ya ya ya mutilation !wow!
but then once you work you are like hello you can only choose from like this basic colours brown black
dark brown or you can choose like [oh] okay maybe a slight ombre from black to light brown that's it that's it that's all you got
where's the creativity man
<malay>macam</malay> it's very bland it's like <malay>macam</malay> you you <malay>masak ayam masak merah</malay> but there's no <malay>merah</malay>
and it's just white chicken it's just [a'ah] it's just boiled chicken it's just boiled chicken
ya so so can we can we bring it back (um) I mean it's not it's been taken out but can we bring it into the society where we can normalise <malay>ayam masak merah</malay> with the <malay>merah</malay>
you know
it's just how people view you but everybody stop viewing me as a person we can all agree that
it's normal
right
