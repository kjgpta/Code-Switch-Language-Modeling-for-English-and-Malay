the the the wait the ex the the ex the official ex that he was with before right cheated on him but then when I got to know how they are
during that relationship right I don't think it was
a real relationship I'm sorry [lah] but (um)
that was like during his teens [lah] like I think eighteen nineteen
ya that's why then after that
eighteen ya but then when I heard about the relationship right I don't think it's what
I would consider as a real relationship

(uh) he's not
so how it ended with me and #amin# is that he was the one who ended it ya so
(um) he didn't say why but he told #amin# [eh] he told #syafiq# it's because like he feels that (uh) he's doing all the work and then I I
I am not reciprocating his efforts but I don't think it's it is that
but then I
I don't think I acted that way [eh]
#amin# now
back then ya I was fond of him that's why I'm still friends with him

#syafiq#
#syafiq# I've been friends with him for more than a decade already [eh]

okay [lah] I will try [lah] this monday when I meet him
(mm)
portrait the fuck
(mm)
[ah]
(uh huh)
ya
ya
that was ya okay okay so after the the ex right
!aiya! I I give people the benefit of doubt [lah]
so anyway (um) so after the the the the the the cheating case
then he dated this other girl
which was his no which was his ex primary school they bump into each other not they bump [lah] I think
they had a primary school reunion
then they met so that's
that was when
that was this [one] [ah] this [one] I think last year
last year or last two years
I think so
ya
[eh] no no no his relationship was just what eight months
ya
ya so (um) the
ya then he dated this his ex primary school friend ya so
this girl she was the one who ended
with him because this girl is much more religious than him so
this girl you know <malay>macam pergi</malay> date <malay>semua</malay> [kan] he she doesn't even want to be <malay>macam macam sekarang kita tengah lepak dekat macam</malay> playground <malay>gini kita dua</malay> [jer] [kan] let's say you are a guy
she doesn't want that
<malay>macam berdua-duaan abeh lepas tu kalau macam nak pergi</malay>
<malay>tengok wayang</malay> cinema <malay>macam dua orang</malay> even though there's there are other people but
is <malay>tetap macam korang dua orang</malay> [jer] [kan] in a dark place also she she's not comfortable with it so
her mindset and like the ex mindset is that if she likes you and (um)
she wants to tie the knot she's ready to settle down
but this is the thing that I am not sure because
I think she has already said [lah] what her intentions are and what she wants in life
ya which is very good I'm very proud of her to you know to know what you want in life and but
(um)
that's the thing I don't I don't
know why he didn't pursue that
how should I don't know I never ask
how he ya
ya so <malay>dengan dia</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> I think he is ready
ready to settle down I think [lah] almost there [lah] but
but then if he is wait wait if he is ready
like you know as in his mindset
whether he whether he is ready or not
for me I'm not ready I'm sure as hell not ready man I need a few more years
to marry ya
wait wait wait ya so
if if I think he really likes this girl [lah] but then this girl wants to get married
but I don't understand why he cannot pursue that
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> she didn't
when she wanted to break things off
that was her reason [ah]
ya
(uh) I never ask for details
(mm)
you know when they first went out right
he asked for permission from the girl's parents
really [ah] I no one has no one has asked me
at all
[orh] ya
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
[orh] okay
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya but when he did that it wasn't with it wasn't with the Muzmatch girl it was with the primary school girl
ya
[ah]
!oops!
!huh!
(mm)
(mm)
ya
acts of what passive aggressive [ah]
[orh]
