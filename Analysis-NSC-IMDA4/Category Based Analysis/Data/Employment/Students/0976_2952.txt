okay I start
(err) my name #azmirul# I'm from singapore poly <malay>sekarang sekolah</malay>
year two marine engineering
you wanna talk about <malay>kita punya</malay> singapore poly life [lah] so far
how is it going
so for me and
<malay>aku rasa aku rasa</malay>
<malay>sekarang boleh</malay> manage [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like last time when I first entered <malay>aku</malay> really <malay>tak minat</malay> the course
so it was kind of <malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk aku</malay>
how about you
okay
[oh] <malay>pasal dulu</malay> my first few choices was (uh) business business finance <malay>abeh aku minat</malay> tourism
so I put there only my first six choice [ah] then my marine engineering was <malay>aku nya tujuh ke lapan</malay> [ah]
I not sure but yes [ah] <malay>aku aku tak minat tapi</malay>
<malay>aku nya</malay> points also don't give me any chance to go anywhere so <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>kena taruk</malay> the <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>kena taruk</malay> any course that I can put [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> along the way #alhamdulillah#
<malay>aku minat</malay> [ah] <malay>aku minat</malay>
<malay>aku minat</malay> [ah] <malay>aku minat</malay> marine engineering <malay>nya</malay> module
and I'm doing quite okay in it [lah]
(mm)
doing okay
so <malay>kau apa sekarang</malay> [lah] like what are you doing in school what are your activities
[oh]
<malay>aku</malay> in <malay>dikir barat</malay> [ah] as you know
I I always tried to pull you in <malay>dikir barat masuk dikir barat tapi kau tak nak masuk</malay> so
now I really want to know the reason why <malay>kau tak nak masuk dikir barat</malay>
okay [lah] <malay>boleh boleh</malay>
#muay thai# <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>bukannya</malay> #muay thai# <malay>nanti</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> stage fright <malay>ke</malay> like <malay>macam ada</malay> spectators <malay>tengok</malay>
is like to win [lah] is like to
is like not to impress the audience but to do it for yourself [lah]
right <malay>faham faham</malay> I understand
so actually our poly life quite stale
because <malay>sekarang pun</malay> COVID
then like <malay>kita lima hari</malay> five days of school but we only come to school three days four days
then <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
so really boring nowadays
so how's your secondary school life
introvert [ah]
studying
<malay>sama juga</malay> I went through the same process only that I wasn't an introvert from the start I create trouble almost all the time in secondary school
in secondary school especially in my
in my <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) younger days [ah] my sec one sec two <malay>menengah satu menengah dua</malay> that kind so I
<malay>banyak masalah dulu dengan cikgu</malay>
every month <malay>bapa kena</malay> call down until I was about sec three ya that was I realise <malay>yang</malay>
I can't be doing it because I almost retained
so that's when <malay>aku sedar</malay> [lah] that I have to bulk up <malay>kalau tak memang aku takleh</malay> survive N or O levels
that's when N levels I did well
I did get twelve points [ah] <malay>takleh</malay>
but
I doubt all the teachers wrong [ah]
so basically then I went to sec five
I got
a decent decent decent grades for all my subject <malay>yang aku ambil</malay>
then <malay>aku</malay> end up in poly now
ya what is the most <malay>macam</malay>
what is the most naughty thing <malay>yang kau pernah buat</malay> secondary school
seems quite introvert and the most <malay>yang paling</malay>
[oh]
<malay>paling mahal</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
so <malay>kira</malay> [kan] self self nominate <malay>kau terus masuk</malay>
actually talking about <malay>yang</malay> student student council student leader and
<malay>dulu</malay> like what you said I was very naughty <malay>nakal gila</malay>
so when I was in sec three the the way teacher ask me to not be naughty is appointing me to be chairperson of the class
so is the only way
that I have to tone down all my nonsense in class
<malay>macam apa aku buat semua aku kena</malay> tone down <malay>pasal aku</malay> chairperson of the class and my school <malay>dorang ada selalu macam</malay> best chairperson
best leader best <malay>apa</malay> so I was like
I cannot I cannot be last [lah] basically <malay>macam</malay> in the rankings so <malay>macam</malay> sec three <malay>tu memang</malay> quite tough [lah] is like I'm still naughty
but end up <malay>nanti cikgu jalan</malay>
<malay>dekat lorong angkat buku aku tolong</malay> [ah] I go <malay>angkat</malay>
teacher you need help [ah] then <malay>aku angkat aku angkat</malay> [kan] <malay>masuk</malay> staffroom
so <malay>kira</malay> like that was one of the worst because I didn't want student leader at all but I got it so <malay>aku</malay> just suck it up [lah]
then after that I think
I used to be a sports leader then I was the I was below the head [lah] I was vice I was vice head for the sport leader last time
and my teachers in sports leaders <malay>suka aku</malay>
<malay>pasal aku</malay> not the quiet type
but students leader <malay>punya cikgu tak suka aku pasal dia rasa aku</malay> naughty <malay>sangat</malay> so there's there's two ways that
goes around the school [lah] <malay>tu yang aku tak berapa suka pasal cikgu nanti ada</malay> different opinion about the same person
ya
that's that's being naughty [lah] <malay>dekat sekolah</malay>
ya
[oh] <malay>kira tu</malay> naughty [ah] [kan]
<malay>kira tu</malay> naughty [ah] [kan]
<malay>tu bikin kau paling</malay> guilty [ah] [kan]
guilty <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
<malay>jadi cikgu tertipu</malay> [kan]
they love it too much [lah] they think you can they can
you can hold on to you [ah]
I think because you are one of the nicest guys in the environment you are in
so <malay>macam dorang dah</malay> bless [ah]
so <malay>lepas</malay> O level after N level
you got work as in got work part time <malay>ke</malay>
burger king
(mm)
I basically after N levels
<malay>aku kerja yang kau tahu</malay> volunteer volunteer <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>yang nampak dekat</malay> (uh) fast jobs <malay>nanti dia cakap</malay> [oh] you volunteer for this run you get fifty dollar allowance [ah] <malay>kira</malay> that time too is big money for me know so <malay>kadang-kadang kalau ada</malay> shape run colour run or standard chartered I would just go for the volunteer
free shirt free meal free money so I just go
that was my basically <malay>aku nya</malay> work for my whole N level till when I go sec five [ah]
so <malay>aku akan kerja</malay> all the way
then basically nothing much [ah] <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>kerja dengan members dengan kawan-kawan</malay> with all my friends then after that after my O levels I started working properly I also work same F&B but not burger king staff
I work there and it was a good experience [lah] it was a good two months
experience <malay>aku pernah</malay> [tau] <malay>sekali kerja</malay>
I work there for about
I work there the whole month I only have three off days
<malay>tiga hari</malay> [jer] off day <malay>aku nya gaji</malay> at that point of time was
going at seven fifty per hour and <malay>satu bulan aku dapat satu ribu lapan ratus</malay>
<malay>selepas</malay> minus
that's how much I work because you have nobody to juggle the stuff give me outlet
so if anybody interested join staff <malay>masuk</malay> [lah] ya so
irony but I do have some problems [lah] I do have some problems over there in terms of how I can click with the people because usually <malay>orang-orang yang kita kerja kat luar tu tak sama</malay> age
don't have the same (uh) mentality as us
the same <malay>pemikiran</malay> [lah] basically so <malay>aku</malay> just
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tahan</malay> for two months then <malay>aku</malay> just took adapt <malay>aku</malay> just try to adapt to the situation [lah] <malay>yang aku aku</malay> was in
then ya I made a few friends malaysian friends
malaysian people you got malaysian
people or not that you work with
they are the best they are the best people to work with so friendly <malay>baik gila</malay>
yup yes correct
and some more nowadays COVID they can't go back to malaysia so they have to rent the houses here
ya they have to to keep to what let's say shampoos necessities <malay>semua dorang kena beli</malay> then they have to keep at home
so it's a tough time [ah] for them and they are still working doubly hard triply hard in singapore
!wah! salute [ah] <malay>dorang</malay>
ya
after staff day nope
I don't <malay>dah</malay>
<malay>tak kerja</malay>
yes how how about you after burger king was McDonald's [what]
the group [mah]
(mm)
okay that was that was fast
like photographer [ah]
<malay>tolong orang ambil gambar</malay>
[oh]
okay that's that's like one hour ten dollars one hour eleven dollars
[oh] is not always the <malay>sama</malay> part [lah]
park
but do you agree or not that F&B pays the least
but you have the best fun
like <malay>macam</malay>
how to say [eh]
as in <malay>aku prefer</malay> [tau] honestly <malay>aku</malay> would prefer a busy
a busy working environment <malay>pasal</malay> at least <malay>aku ada benda</malay> [tau] <malay>nak buat</malay> like something to do <malay>kalau</malay> they never come and visit they never come and buy your stuff you feel like you more tired and the time go slower
my opinion [ah]
and these courses you need to be independent nobody can spoon feed
<malay>macam benda ni semua</malay> I can see <malay>cikgu kita</malay> are harsh in some ways but they are also training us to be <malay>macam</malay> very independent because in the future <malay>semua benda-benda</malay> engineering <malay>ni semua</malay>
<malay>dorang dah ajar</malay>
you apply yourself
they won't <malay>hari-hari tengok kau buat</malay>
they would expect you to know how to do and all
that's why <malay>macam</malay> I feel engineering early brush you [lah] and if you you are not focus in the course you will really flop [ah]
<malay>macam betul-betul</malay> flop then <malay>susah</malay> once you know once <malay>dah jatuh</malay> in poly <malay>susah nak naik balik</malay>
very hard to reach the top back
ya
internship correct you go sailing you're going sailing
so you are second semester run
<malay>aku masuk</malay> shore which is first first semester so right after this semester <malay>aku</malay> probably has a month's break then after that <malay>aku dah kena masuk</malay> intern [lah]
ya
I don't know how many weeks I think thirty six
okay fun story the reason why I put marine as my seventh or eighth choice was
because I was intrigued
by <malay>dia punya</malay> sailing
<malay>aku nak belayar</malay> basically I just want to go
explore countries <malay>negara semua negara</malay> england <malay>semua</malay> whatever [lah]
(uh) <malay>yang ada</malay> ports <malay>semua</malay> [kan] saudi arabia <malay>ke</malay> whatever
so <malay>aku memang aku memang tahu yang kalau nak</malay>
<malay>dapat</malay> sailing results must be very strong
because it's the top few [ah] from what I know [lah] from my past experience for my friends that tell me and all that
so <malay>aku</malay> legit work very hard
<malay>untuk aku</malay> year one year two <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>rezeki tak ada aku tak dapat</malay>
I never get into sailing that's when I got very very disappointed
but
<malay>aku punya</malay> type is <malay>aku tak suka lawan dengan takdir</malay> [ah]
so I just follow the flow
so at the end of the day <malay>aku</malay> don't mind shore <malay>kalau dapat</malay> keppel okay [lor]
<malay>kira</malay> very good [orh] keppel
then ya [lah] I'm still okay with it ya so how about you
(mm)
ya <malay>betul</malay>
but ya [lah] you so you are willing [lah] <malay>kau kira</malay> willing <malay>untuk</malay> sail every year six months
to make it as your career
time <malay>kau balik pun dah penat</malay>
(mm)
correct agree
so your ultimate goal is to get <malay>macam</malay>
the highest type of engineer which is chief engineer then you just work shore [lah]
ya that's your plan I think that sounds like a good plan [ah]
<malay>pasal</malay> you are not away from your family too long
but you're grinding your first few years
when when you just start working
good plan actually
you can cool down [lah]
surveyor <malay>macam benda</malay> relax [ah]
ya
yup but honestly
okay [ah] during during circuit breaker and all we all <malay>semua</malay> stuck <malay>dekat rumah</malay>
so I've been watching a lot of youtube videos
and that's when I I fall in love with biomedical
<malay>pelik</malay> but yes <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> found a love from
karma medic [lah] <malay>nama</malay> youtube channel
and <malay>aku suka</malay> biomedical from there so I did more research on it
fun fact during secondary school I took physics but all my physics class I never go you know where I go I go inside bio class <malay>duduk belakang dengar</malay>
that's how much I love bio last time
but ya the love come back and I feel like <malay>kalau</malay> I do well in my poly get the highest that I could
I can probably try for biomedical engineering when I go uni <malay>ke apa</malay>
ya so talking about uni <malay>kita belum lagi lepas</malay>
so is not over yet for us
so
where do you plan to go where do you think you'll end up
you want green green
why
<malay>wayang</malay> [ah]
annoying
<malay>kacau-kacau</malay>
like what could you do when you're at the age of eight like what's the worst
all my books
stomp they will just stare at you
yup understand
(mm)
I want I want the police I want navy first okay
because navy is just fun [lah] I mean
I I watch a lot of [ah] boys to men [ah] so I find the navy part the best [ah]
so [ah] the frogmen one <malay>tu yang paling gerek</malay> [ah]
so <malay>aku nak masuk</malay> navy <malay>tapi aku tahu</malay>
<malay>aku tahu tak</malay> probably <malay>tak ada</malay> chance [lah] <malay>masuk</malay> navy [kan]
<malay>ada</malay> chance will be slim
but yes [ah] so <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>tak aku nak</malay> try my best to go police
<malay>kalau</malay> police <malay>pun</malay>
I really hope
because right now I'm overweight so
<malay>aku kena</malay> train <malay>banyak</malay> so definitely I got a feeling that would be PES
got highly likely [lah]
PES PES B pending so I hope to go to the normal PES after I finish my I pass my
then after that I hope I can go to [ah]
special operations command
<malay>kalau tak pun</malay> I don't mind
[eh] <malay>pula</malay> I don't mind civil defense
because I wanna be firefighter
ya so I don't mind police navy and
police navy and (uh)
[ah] firefighter civil defense
but I mind air force because I'm scared of heights
like I cannot take it I cannot I just cannot I take aeroplane once in my life [hor]
<malay>tu pun pergi</malay> [tau] <malay>sampai berapa tiga puluh minit dah sampai</malay>
so ya air force is a no no
bungee jump is a no no
but I got feeling I need to go because I will be the first [leh]
my father never go so <malay>aku rasa</malay> I'll be the first to enter so I think I know always the first person will always <malay>kena hijau</malay> from the trend [lah] that's what they say [lah] but no <malay>hijau</malay> for me because secondary school I was in
and find it boring [lah] my opinion <malay>macam gitu-gitu</malay> [jer] ya okay [lah] <malay>tengok macam mana</malay>
will definitely be will definitely glow up [lah] after
confirm puff
blow up
yes
correct
yes correct so
I mean the
I mean the
honestly I I don't I don't fancy
<malay>tapi kalau aku dapat</malay> air force who wouldn't take it
who wouldn't take it
I will take it
and it's like we have to take it we have no choice but to take it
ya so
ya I don't fancy it but I don't mind it so let's say you put me in engineering or communications I'm okay
ya even if I get what intelligence
!chey! !wah! <malay>pandai</malay> [seh] <malay>tak</malay> [ah] intelligence
I don't think got chance [ah]
intelligence
talk [eh]
four hours
quick maths [ah]
okay
<malay>susah dok</malay>
it was okay
what was your score though they never tell you <malay>tak bilang</malay>
but how do you think you did though was it like okay did you find it difficult <malay>ke apa</malay>
so now you're not in under any scholarship or
whatever no you're just
you just want to end the diploma [lah] there's normally
consider
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>ke dah dah minat nak</malay> sign on
pilot I heard they need to be of certain height and a certain in weight and a certain eye eyesight
<malay>kena berapa bagus</malay> !wow!
<malay>ada</malay> size <malay>dia</malay> [ah]
okay
it's kinda cool though
(mm)
primary school
<malay>sekarang berapa</malay> years
<malay>masih</malay> [eh] <malay>masih sama aku ingat sekarang dah tiga tahun</malay> [jer] primary school
(mm)
is like our one of our longest [ah]
yes correct
is who you want to shape to be [ah]
<malay>bila</malay> primary school [kan] <malay>nanti</malay>
who's your idol who's your idol don't remember confirm
<malay>nanti kita tengok</malay> movie movie who's your idol who's your idol who do you like
that kind of thing you so from there <malay>kita semua dah</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> basically know the type of person you want to be like (err) like for me last time when I was in primary school
one of the first <malay>macam</malay> entertainment <malay>punya</malay> movie show [kan] was [ah]
wrestling
so I really look up to them [ah]
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I didn't realise [tau] <malay>yang itu semua watak</malay>
as in <malay>tu semua bohong macam bedek tu semua</malay> just <malay>rekaan</malay> [tau] I didn't know
then I thought <malay>macam</malay> okay let's say <malay>macam dulu</malay> undertaker <malay>betul-betul</malay> [lah] <malay>dia jahat betul-betul</malay> [lah] <malay>dia nak nak nak menang</malay> [jer] <malay>nak kasi orang sakit</malay>
so I like their character [ah]
so I like the character so everytime I come school I try to walk like <malay>macam</malay> undertaker
<malay>buat mata dia yang</malay> roll eyes back
so <malay>kira macam</malay> last time primary school was one of the best times because
<malay>kita</malay> explore [ah]
<malay>kita</malay> explore <malay>banyak benda</malay>
<malay>satu hari kita</malay> undertaker the next day we john cena the next day #yuka civi#
ya that was that was fun days [ah]
ya in primary school also <malay>dulu kita suka buat banyak</malay> parkour
do you do parkour in school it's like normal [lah] primary school do parkour
ya was the was the peak [ah]
yes
(mm)
(mm)
okay
[oh]
so you have been leading all the way [lah] you have been leading the lines [lah]
discipline
(mm)
okay correct me if I'm wrong the right side is
feeder
the right side
the the centre is
#tekong# the left side is striker
[oh]
left-legged or right-legged
okay
so what what's your best position
striker <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>bebas</malay>
<malay>bebas</malay> like horse kick right
have you ever heard of queenstown primary school though
<malay>sepak takraw</malay>
they were national team player [ah] after they finish
secondary school
yup
but they are both from primary queenstown primary
ya
have you ever win the finals <malay>pernah menang</malay>
<malay>selalu kalah dengan siapa</malay>
who's your bogey team [ah] <malay>macam selalu jumpa dorang mesti</malay>
<malay>kalah punya</malay>
#junyuan# #tampines# located around #tampines# [kan]
#junyuan#
who did you lost to in the finals
okay
okay
yes
ninety ninety plus [lah]
pressure [lah]
so it's best three best to three basically
disappointed
<malay>sedih</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you felt just dropping on your shoulders like suddenly
you never go this far [lah]
!woo! amazing story
for me <malay>kalau bab-bab</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> <malay>atau</malay> activity [kan]
I don't really have much luck [lah]
in it because when I was in primary school I was in football
I was goalkeeper you know you know when <malay>kau penjaga gawang</malay> in primary school
you will always be blamed
if the goals you concede so we basically second round <malay>kita dah keluar</malay> everytime
<malay>kita masuk</malay> south zone <malay>kita keluar kita</malay> group stages
then secondary school I was in so <malay>kau tahu</malay> <malay>ada banyak</malay>
[lah] <malay>yang joget-joget sambil</malay> marching
to our highest position that we ever got
in #gan eng seng# secondary school was seventh
and that was from my batch
so my batch got the highest ever which is seventh
seventh out of about sixteen schools
that makes us (err) (err) the
the the drop dead centre [lah]
then when I go so basically no luck [lah] I go delta league also I play under my school name
(uh) and that [one] second round also out delta league is a league whereby the police
[ah] make the police create the league <malay>untuk macam orang-orang tak</malay>
<malay>buat buat kerja nakal macam</malay>
<malay>dadah</malay>
under age smoking
so the police made this association made this league
<malay>untuk</malay> all the <malay>budak melayu</malay> not only <malay>budak melayu</malay> [lah] <malay>budak melayu budak cina</malay> there are all types of races to come as a team to play football
for a prize
so I entered that under my school name with all my classmates with all my schoolmates my juniors and seniors <malay>semua masuk</malay>
<malay>tu pun</malay> second round <malay>kita</malay> out
then when I goes poly
I join <malay>dikir barat</malay>
I join <malay>dikir barat</malay> and my first ever performance
we got second last
and that was also disappointed disappointing for me [lah] it was normal for the rest
but it was the first time for me
so of course after the performance <malay>aku nangis</malay> [siol]
<malay>aku nangis</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> really my heart was pouring [ah]
but I see all my seniors they're laughing
so that that was when my mood for <malay>dikir</malay> honestly
like
go down [ah]
but
but because I'm the type of guy whereby
I need to see change
because if I love something
and I see the thing is going wrongly
or doing things the wrong way
<malay>aku kena aku kena</malay> step in to change
but then I know there's somebody else better than me that can do that can change the to be a better one
so when I entered in second year
(um) this my biggest accomplishment so far in all my in all my life as in school life is when they appointed me as captain
for <malay>dikir barat</malay>
they they appointed me as captain and
I didn't it's not I didn't want to take it but my parents <malay>ragu-ragu</malay> [ah]
my parents will think [eh] <malay>macam mana aku nya anak nya</malay> results
<malay>sekolah pelajaran akan</malay> jeopardise <malay>ke tak</malay>
that kind of thing so <malay>aku pun macam</malay> second guess [ah] <malay>aku</malay> second guess but I love <malay>dikir barat</malay> so much
and I look at how rich our history
in <malay>dikir barat</malay> twenty eleven champion twenty twelve champion twenty thirteen fifth twenty fourteen first
twenty fifteen seventh twenty sixteen second twenty seventeen last twenty eighteen second last twenty nineteen second last
twenty twenty fourth which is this year
this year finally we got fourth
after twenty sixteen after four years
since second we got our best position which is fourth
and I'm very happy with my team
like that's the biggest accomplishment but I never ever felt the podium kind of
the podium kind of accomplishment something that you never face before like <malay>macam nama</malay> engraved <malay>dekat dekat kau nya</malay> trophy I also never had the recognition of
<malay>pemenang dikir barat</malay> singapore poly never had that kind of recognition so but I feel like being a captain itself
and leading the team is really like an accomplishment
it's a heavy responsibility <malay>tapi</malay> we have fun doing it right like it's fun leading and it's fun
<malay>macam</malay> teaching
because it just give a lot of motivation when
you and your friend you teaching your friend rather than coach teaching a friend
you know because sometimes
your <malay>kawan takkan</malay> [eh] coach <malay>pasal</malay> they coach <malay>kau marah dia tapi kau</malay> as a <malay>kawan kau</malay> still <malay>tolong</malay> that kind of thing
ya so I guess
we have our ups and downs <malay>juga</malay> [ah]
both of us ya
wee sweet sweet
ya that that that's very demotivating is like
<malay>kau</malay> cannot
you
you will not succeed
<malay>kalau kau</malay> always feel that you are at the bottom
you know
at least something know
<malay>dah kita dah</malay> improve at least be happy about it <malay>jangan cakap</malay> !yay! <malay>tak</malay> last
how how would that be
how would that be happy for everyone when everyone is celebrating that we at least got fourth
it's very hard for a to rump up fourth though
and read up on fourth just one below third
you know
yes
