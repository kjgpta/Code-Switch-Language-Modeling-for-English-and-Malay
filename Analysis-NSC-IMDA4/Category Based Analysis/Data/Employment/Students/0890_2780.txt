super <malay>senang apa lagi</malay>
okay so (um) you are from #ngee ann# [kan]

like is it fun <malay>ada kawan-kawan ke tak</malay>
ya
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh kau punya</malay> time table like how is your
is it <malay>banyak</malay> time <malay>untuk</malay> relax <malay>atau tak</malay>
<malay>abeh pukul berapa</malay> what like what time is your lesson
[oh] ya I saw like I always see your Instagram like <malay>kau macam penat gila</malay> because you always like
remember that time when we went to school and you and we were literally at the the same
<malay>abeh aku</malay> wave at you and you literally didn't you ignored me bro I was so sad
I was so sad
I I waved so big (uh)
(uh huh)
period
<malay>tapi aku</malay>
no <malay>aku</malay> literally waved at you
and I was low-key like ashamed
ya
embarrassed [kan] ya <malay>aku pun</malay> I felt so <malay>malu</malay> because of that
ya because you know the that thing actually happened to me literally down your block
that time <malay>aku</malay> remember that I told you the story
like that time I was down your block I saw this girl <malay>pakai tudung</malay> exactly same as you
and then no she was
(err) I <malay>aku aku</malay> not mad at you <malay>aku</malay> mad at the situation because <malay>aku</malay> was so embarrassed <malay>aku malu gila</malay> I was down the block
and then
I saw (uh) cause it was at night <malay>malam-malam</malay> so <malay>aku</malay> saw this lady
she was wearing her <malay>tudung</malay> and she was in the dark
<malay>dia dalam gelap</malay>
it was you so I gave the biggest
wave <malay>paling besar di dalam dunia</malay> like literally like this
and then she just stared at me so I felt something was off
<malay>macam tak kena gitu</malay> situation <malay>gitu</malay>
so I was like okay maybe I should just continue waving
and she just stared at me and she just did her stuff so I'm like okay that is not #huda#
that if you lived at me then I would just like have stood there and not like
I don't know I thought you I don't know cause I look up to like ya
probably probably I don't know
ya so for me <malay>sekolah aku</malay> I think it's super <malay>senang</malay> to go to school because I don't have to take a bus
<malay>aku tengah</malay> flex right now ya
ya
ya
all the COVID stuff [kan]
ya cause now my school <malay>kalau kau nak masuk kau nak kena ada dia punya</malay> card like the specific card
measures no (uh) no as in in terms of the zones like for your school <malay>kau ada</malay> zone like different different zones
<malay>yang</malay> colour <malay>biru merah</malay> orange
my school is just as long as you enter with TraceTogether it's fine do you have TraceTogether must you download
ya
I think TraceTogether is quite convenient
like you get to
you don't even have to key in your information no more
so it's
<malay>kenapa</malay>
<malay>kenapa</malay>
ya
the only my school has #mala# at (uh) food court <malay>empat</malay>
no
period bro I don't know
ya <malay>tu pun</malay>
#izzah# is which one
[oh] <malay>kita punya</malay> junior [eh]
[oh] <malay>dia makan</malay> #mala#
ya ya <malay>tapi</malay> <malay>kita boleh masuk ke tak</malay>
to #dabao# for us is it
[kan]
I think #mala# is so good I kind of take it for granted
[oh] you did
[oh] you didn't
ya
ya count my blessings
ya
but the thing is #mala# at causeway point <malay>macam mahal gila</malay>
I don't know if it's <malay>mahal gila</malay> [eh]
no <malay>tapi</malay> (um) I told #amira# then I (um) (err) <malay>apa</malay> #jaz#
#jaz# she ate it it was like seven dollar per person cause <malay>dia tak makan</malay> the <malay>daging semua</malay> the <malay>daging</malay> is a mistake
who eats the <malay>daging</malay> you just go for the
that doesn't count as <malay>daging</malay> that counts as one of those processed meat <malay>macam</malay> spam <malay>daging</malay> is like literally <malay>daging yang macam masak tu</malay>
during common (mm)
(mm)
of course it's gonna be <malay>mahal</malay> it's like duck meat (err)
remember duck meat <malay>punya</malay> #ramen# that we ate at the <malay>apa</malay>
I was asking my <malay>bapa</malay> cause he was like asking like suggestions to eat and I was like [oh] can I suggest then I was like [oh] can we eat at the #ramen# and then he was like (err) I'll think about it then we never eat
because I was literally like craving it
tak
cause (err)
he was taking suggestions and then I was like assuming like [oh] it's an activity we gotta go then the next day I was like waiting for him to like invite us out and then he didn't say anything
(mmhmm)
#ramen# is like a top
like
it was good
ya why you don't like it
what you order [ah]
was it one of those like <malay>lemak</malay>
why didn't you put the spice
[oh] ya <malay>sebab kau punya</malay> stomach [kan] <malay>ada</malay> problem <malay>sekarang</malay>
<malay>kesian</malay> baby
(uh) <malay>sebab</malay> you're like a baby you can't like handle the full Samyang experience that sounds like a
a new problem I see was it good
wait hold on pause Samyang light is just like
just add less of the sauce [ah]
the flavour profile
do do you get when I'm length
(mmhmm)
<malay>macam</malay> like the gravy [ah]
then how was it

but the thing are like Samyang the noodles are like thick
(mm)
so you can say as in like you don't hate the flavour
!wow!
I don't I don't get why you don't like the carbonara [one] carbonara [one] is literally like the best <malay>punya</malay> flavour
<malay>jelak</malay>
carbonara

we only have carbonara in this house I had my dad
[oh] the packet
huge difference
which do you like
what's wrong with the cup [one] cup [one] is everywhere
(uh huh)
is it because you never leave it inside for a longer time because I like my Samyang to be like puffy what's the word <malay>macam</malay> like
ya I've never heard I've never heard that work before
are you like making it up
[oh] I don't know why but <malay>semalam aku macam</malay> on a
university <malay>punya</malay> rush so I was like looking at all the
ya because I <malay>aku fikir</malay> (uh) I really don't have a choice but to like look through <malay>siapa</malay> #lia# <malay>punya</malay> boyfriend <malay>sekarang dekat</malay> [kan]
what was his his course [ah] or should I ask like #lia# to ask him about <malay>dia punya</malay> experience
what like which one
<malay>ada banyak</malay> (mm)
<malay>dorang</malay> take in like
ya <malay>kau tak kau tak</malay> research ke
passionate
really
then what
then <malay>lepas</malay> poly <malay>kau nak buat apa</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
uni is
thirty eight
(mm)
what what's your
[oh] okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>siapa kata</malay>
you actually like [oh] so <malay>kau macam</malay> like committed [ah] in that sense okay
why
(uh) <malay>aku</malay> scared yang <malay>dorang tengah</malay> trying to convince you to spend more money by the way they say it
(mm)
they they were giving that
tone like [jer] you know it's like a little bit like don't fall for that don't fall for that
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh]
she ya you should just since <malay>kau ada</malay> connection might as well just take advantage of it [ah]
<malay>dekat</malay> singapore
<malay>kerja kat</malay> perth [ah]
few here
<malay>jangan</malay> world <malay>ni dah dah</malay> start <malay>ni dah</malay> start <malay>dah</malay> start
<malay>tadi tadi macam</malay> like on a you're still on the ground <malay>tapi ni</malay> a bit like floating
ya floating
(mmhmm)
but like ya that sounds like a plan [ah]
you I thought your mum <malay>ada</malay> your mum <malay>kasi</malay>
or I thought she was the one <malay>yang ada</malay> attachment <malay>punya</malay> issues <malay>dengan kau</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> like my <malay>kawan</malay> #elisa#
<malay>dia pun</malay> like thinking of
#elisa# (uh)
<malay>yang</malay> half malay half chinese <malay>yang</malay> whose in my classmate
[oh] <malay>tu tahu</malay> okay (um) #elisa# <malay>dia selalu kata</malay> but to her ma <malay>yang</malay> [oh]
ma one day I might want to go to like overseas or like migrate and then she's then cause she's like the youngest one and then all her <malay>kakak</malay> is like big
age gap
(mm)
so <malay>dia mak dia selalu</malay> like [oh] then I'll come with you [lah] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
so like
ya
so it's a bit like she said she was a bit like worried
not worried like I think it was a bit like
scared cause she knew that she could like never leave like the nest
cause <malay>mak dia</malay> is quite to <malay>tua</malay> [lah] ya
I mean ya [lah]
ya
ya ya
she's like super smart so she could like probably like get a scholarship and sweep it off her feet because
that's why she works like so (uh) hard [lah] because she knows that her position is like not
I think she has a four point O I think [ah]
no but if you have the four point [oh] it'll be known door because usually that
why [ah]
(uh) I don't think my
(uh)
she gets like (uh) awards [lah] she's always like the top two because (err) my friend daphne she has a four point O which I didn't know until
ya
why you so
ya ya ya
because I didn't know until like she posted on Twitter she was like [oh] guys I need to maintain my four point O like on for my intern
and she said it okay okay she did [lah] it wasn't kinda like show off show #offy# <malay>punya</malay> manner
so <malay>aku</malay> then I was like <malay>aku macam</malay> shocked because I didn't know this also like it makes sense [lah] because she's also like super smart
my course is so filled with so many smart people <malay>aku macam</malay> so intimidated
ya
grades
no no no no no
it's (uh) sometimes no no we're not competitive that's not like the that's just not our culture [lah] our <malay>punya</malay> course <malay>punya</malay> culture like no one is like
no one's like (uh) out there to get one another we're because we're such like a
we're like so <malay>sikit</malay>
<malay>punya orang</malay> if we like make enemies then the ecosystem will like break you get what I mean
<malay>kau punya</malay> course <malay>banyak orang</malay> y'all make enemies you won't you can just like
avoid
<malay>tak tahu</malay> (err) but I think she's still going for the
arts and business management route [lah] but I don't know what she's gonna do
but she has her whole life figured out [tau] cause like
she was telling me like
all these and then she was telling about how how her whole friend group
<malay>apa macam</malay> plan like have like one whole like plan for like <malay>dorang punya</malay> rest of their lives
ya [lah] like
after poly <malay>dorang gi</malay> university then after that <malay>apa kerja sikit</malay> then
like
get married like it was more like detailed than what what I'm trying to say
ya
so like whenever I'm with her <malay>aku macam</malay> like intimidated <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab aku selalu</malay> [kan] <malay>aku ada</malay> going with the flow <malay>punya</malay> attitude
but I know what I want to like but at least like luckily I got like what I want to do [lah] I think it's my intern [lah] you were right what you were saying <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>kau punya</malay> comment [lah] like #huda# I'm so proud of you
[kan] you're proud of me right
(ugh)
<malay>pergi</malay> overseas
<malay>tapi dia</malay> like <malay>pandai</malay> enough to go for local uni [ah] so I'm not too worried about her
(uh) I think her overseas dream is <malay>untuk</malay> like
after education [ah] like she wants like migrate
like <malay>kerja sana</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
!fuh! [oh]
get like (uh)
(mm)
help them
(mm)
singaporean
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
okay
ya it's a lot
(mm)
ya <malay>sebab dorang ada</malay> minimum wage <malay>semua</malay>
[a'ah]
okay okay (mmhmm)
it is quite low but that's the culture [lah] I guess so what happened to the guy
the seven thousands dollars a year
he just keep it
[oh] it's like a
okay
so that gave you hope to like be able to like
!huh!
(mm)
I mean <malay>kau ada</malay>
but the paying off is quite long [pe]
ya
and
so don't borrow that much money [lah] you want take a loan
you try to like pay
(mm)
(mm)
it's better to like have a loan with your parents than a loan with like a bank because banks are always like the interest <malay>semua</malay> the
ya I think the realisation that <malay>kita macam</malay> like growing up just like hits
are you gonna miss poly
[orh]
what would you like restart your poly experience if you could
what would you do different
what does that mean O two
[oh] <malay>sebab ada</malay> #dina#
then what course are you gonna go for for uni
ya
ya then do you need any like
[ah] foundation or whatever <malay>tak tahu</malay>
(mm)
(oo) doing A math again sounds like my number one nightmare
(mm)
I want to learn more about like <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>aku nak belajar</malay> more about <malay>macam</malay> like social work <malay>gitu</malay>
because like
when I went for my intern I really like felt <malay>macam</malay> like left (uh) not left out [lah] I just felt
not in the social work [ah] [kan] <malay>aku bilang kau</malay> social service organisations <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> like in the
industry
<malay>kalau</malay> all fails I I can be like a teacher <malay>kau pun nak jadi</malay> teacher
<malay>cikgu</malay> [kan]
<malay>cikgu</malay> #aliah#
(ugh)
(mm)
I mean like <malay>aku aku</malay> knew that I had like interest in like
<malay>kerja</malay> for like the community <malay>gitu</malay> like I like to give back to the society <malay>gitu</malay> because like
I don't know like
doing business just like sucks the life out of you like it's so like <malay>macam</malay> boring and like
I really like at the end of the day <malay>aku macam</malay> like
don't want to be an entrepreneur that's not the life for me [ah]
(mmhmm)
<malay>macam apa</malay> #haziq#
ya
#haziq# <malay>dia pergi apa</malay> <malay>kau tahu yang</malay> internship <malay>yang</malay> international
but then <malay>sebab</malay>
the overseas <malay>punya</malay> internship it was supposed to be overseas
[ah] <malay>tak tahu pula</malay>
indonesia
it it was some like
ya <malay>tapi sebab dia</malay> [kan] like
<malay>dia</malay> he okay okay so
I know <malay>kau</malay> kind of like sceptical <malay>pasal dia punya</malay> like wealth
<malay>tapi</malay> (uh) #elisa# like <malay>dia</malay> explain to <malay>aku</malay> like <malay>dia punya</malay> how
he is like a millionaire and then I'm like [oh] this makes sense so maybe if I explain it to you
in this like manner maybe <malay>kau macam</malay> like believe
him is it okay (hmm)
so <malay>dia</malay> millionaire <malay>sebab</malay>
he would like his family would like invest in like oil <malay>punya</malay> stocks
and then like the
<malay>apa</malay> return investment I'm like <malay>aku macam</malay> like a terrible
ya it's like worth like
hundred thousand which should like deduct to be like <malay>sekarang kau</malay> believe <malay>tak</malay>
okay
why
the me me on my arm
<malay>ni ni</malay> on like (um) oil
so like !wow! oil
<malay>dorang kaya dorang</malay> like old money
I think so
whatever [lah]
if
(uh) so he went for like
cause <malay>sebab</malay> (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
on last friday <malay>tu aku</malay> I had to do like a sharing
about my civic internship and then I thought I was gonna be like the only
sharer there who's like an <malay>punya</malay> student <malay>tapi</malay> #haziq# was there also and I'm like (ugh)
ya
<malay>kau nak tengok</malay>
[ah] <malay>nanti aku</malay> show <malay>kau</malay> I was like talking about [pe]
(um) civic internship has really impacted me in a positive manner
you know <malay>aku</malay> pulled out all the I pulled out all the cards <malay>macam</malay>
and then he also talking about his internship [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> really <malay>kesian dia</malay> [lah] <malay>dia macam kau</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> cause about COVID then he had to like
come back to singapore <malay>gitu</malay>
I think he was already like out
I think this was before
(uh) because
<malay>kau</malay> cancelled immediately <malay>sebab</malay> was like in a mess
<malay>tapi</malay> this [one] was like indonesia was still like okay [lah] singapore indonesia <malay>boleh pergi</malay> because it was like in the same like circumference
so they [ah] <malay>pergi</malay> [lah] but then
after that they were like (err) this is worst than we expected you have to come back then <malay>gitu</malay>
he did it online [ah]
he did his whole internship online
I think so ya
because your [one] is <malay>apa macam</malay> tourist <malay>punya</malay> management so you you had to like have people there
this [one] was like business so everything could have been done online [lah] so it <malay>semua</malay> makes sense [ah] I'm

it's like I think (uh) cause I think <malay>aku ada</malay> break from coffee <malay>sebab</malay> I was like
<malay>kat rumah</malay> the whole time so I didn't like really was like
going out and drinking coffee
then after that (uh) I think a couple of weeks ago when I texted you was the first <malay>macam</malay> like
time <malay>minum</malay> coffee then <malay>aku</malay> my anxiety was like I had like I was so anxious
and then
ya ya and then I knew it wasn't because like I was anxious before cause I had nothing to be like anxious about
and then suddenly <malay>aku macam</malay> like so like scared
ya it was so scary and then
that day <malay>aku minum</malay> coffee day [lah] because I thought it was just like a one off thing you know
<malay>macam</malay> you know experiment we have to do it like a couple of times to make sure you're right
ya ya ya then it happened again like I was so anxious then I was like overthinking
about things and it was so scary then I think
<malay>sekarang aku</malay> really cannot <malay>minum</malay> coffee again
which is <malay>sedih</malay> cause I love the taste of coffee you know how much I love like the taste of coffee
but I think I really need to do what's best for my body [lah]

my favourite kind of business is
<malay>orang yang suka</malay> baking then they sell like those
I'm <malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>bilang kau aku aku dah orang manis</malay> so I need to consume (err) <malay>manis</malay>

can't
like she wants them to act way more mature for their age <malay>dia ada dia punya</malay> expectations
<malay>terlalu</malay> high

like
and she's she expect all these guys to have like a stable job when <malay>apa dorang kat</malay> poly <malay>ke</malay> serving
like
you know <malay>kita tengah sekolah</malay>
(mm)
why
ya
(mmhmm)
<malay>kesian dia</malay>
but I don't think she can like she can realise that (uh) because she's in too deep already
is it <malay>sebab dia desperate</malay> to like
can like also get out of the house or something <malay>sebab dia punya</malay> environment very like toxic <malay>sikit</malay>
I know they are strict [ah] but I don't know what
