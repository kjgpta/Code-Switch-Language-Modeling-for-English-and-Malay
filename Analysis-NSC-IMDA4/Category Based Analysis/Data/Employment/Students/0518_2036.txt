the moment they stress me about studies I cannot function any more
ya
(mm) ya kind of mine wasn't give up I just cannot function
no okay I I have a reasoning
you know why it's because [kan]
if you
okay for example you give me this assignment
you tell me it's due
okay no no no back then here was my rationale
it was because
the class is the next day [what]
why are you looking there look at me
okay so the class is always the next day right
and then whatever is going to be taught in that class is about the previous (uh) homework [lah]
the later you do the more you'll remember
that was my rationale
no [meh]
it's like
okay for example [eh] you
I don't know the
if you if you study the later later part the more you can remember [what]
until now I still do that
[ah] [lah] primary school not that hard
I didn't say it wasn't that hard
to not remember a lot of things
because the teacher make us struggle
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
same [lah]
[ah] think you know you are only one year older than me

that's how I got into <malay>dikir</malay> [what]
it was because
ya at first #hannah# say (err) we got this this and then we need people then I was like okay [lor] sure [lor] then just join
then every there everyone there was so nice and I feel I liked it

(mm) because we were the leaders [what]
like in sec four we're already leading the whole team
