!huh! serious
[oh] like that I play [eh]
I also just finish my exam like a week ago
so
I think I can start
<malay>main balik</malay> [ah]
but my rank is really low
like
I think I even hit the chicken
<malay>yang ayam punya</malay> rank
so I'm not sure but I can
log in later and see
I hoped they revamp a lot of the
better [eh] no their
hero <malay>lama</malay>
cause like they are so underused like
I'm pretty sure they still got value left
[oh] #layla# and #eudora#
but
<malay>aku main</malay> more to majors tho so
but I think I want to try playing fighter also [ah]
(hmm)
but I (hmm) but I used to play assassin also [ah] last time but I stop already cause like assassin is too squishy
then
[oh] and the toxic player back then is
<malay>melampau</malay>
so
I try not to play assassin anymore then my rank also went down like from eighty percent
and then it falls to like
I think it's lesser than fifty
so I'm still embarrass if people ask me for my rank and not to mention <malay>aku punya</malay>
skin is
one of those really premium skin that no one can get and truth to be told <malay>aku</malay> actually spend
diamonds
on that skin
I spent like
sixty dollars just for the skin on a a hero that I don't even play anymore
so
you know what
I will play mobile legend I will make that sixty dollars worth
okay so you're mythic but
like at least for me [kan] <malay>aku kena baca</malay> all the builds <malay>dulu</malay> [tau] <malay>dengan tengok</malay> video <malay>semua</malay> before <malay>aku main</malay>
so if you wanna if you want me to play [ah] I need to like
really do my research for my sixteen dollars game I'm bad seeing revamp heroes them I'm pretty sure they going at the buff heroes also
really
do my research for my sixty dollars game
(hmm)
but since they revamp hero
then I'm pretty sure they're gonna debuff heroes also
and then I definitely can't play sixty dollar #karina# anymore
okay wait no I will I will not I have I have to it's sixty dollars
to do it
I think
I will start slow [ah] do you know that
<malay>kalau</malay> rank
rank <malay>siang</malay> my chicken rank
all the players are new right but because I'm not new so I'm actually
wait how do I say
like taking advantage
of the situation
where people think like <malay>kita semua</malay>
player <malay>baru</malay> but
truth to be told there's a nerd under there who knows all their builds
and like witnesses
so
I'm gonna like
I'm gonna rank up and I'm gonna purposely lose so that I can stay in this rank forever and feel like a
like a winner
are you with me
okay okay [lah] if you say the toxic is already lessen
<malay>aku</malay> join [lah]
(err)
but since you're a mage or a marksman then I think I will go for those like
I'm close range [ah]
cause like if you fight from afar then <malay>siapa yang nak</malay> fight <malay>dekat depan tiada orang</malay>
[oh] ya wait I actually I can actually be a tank I remember I would do when <malay>kita</malay> lolita <malay>dengan apa</malay> [ah]
like lolita <malay>dengan siapa</malay>
(err)
is it I was aurora
I'm not so sure
(hmm) but
okay ya I think I'll be the tank I think I remember being a minotaur
and I was just going hulk on like everywhere
(um) but <malay>aku nak</malay> try fighter <malay>juga</malay> [ah]
I got this one new fighter that I rarely use but okay wait I didn't spend money on this this is
all hard work (uh huh)
(err)
I got the premium skin the what is it called [ah] the dragon
the dragon hunter no so bad ass
ya ya it's the #freya# it's the fighter and they did <malay>dia orang macam</malay> revamp #freya# right but because <malay>macam tiada orang</malay> like no one really hear nor really plays #freya# that much so
take #freya# for granted so that's why when like if you see people who know how to play #freya# [eh] #freya# but actually I've actually right actually do not know how to play #freya# at all I think that one time when you did show me play #freya# and like I got eighteen kills [kan]
actually <malay>itu aku</malay> smash buttons [jer] bro <malay>aku tak tahu apa aku buat kadang-kadang pun aku tak tahu aku tak baca</malay> skill <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> just smash smash
<malay>tak tahu macam mana menang tapi menang</malay> [lah] then like
I know you say I'm good but actually in the truth I was just smashing buttons
(hmm) so the skin pretty [lah] but the skill not there [ah] <malay>itu itu</malay> I think <malay>kau main dengan aku punya #freya# aku</malay> think <malay>kau pun boleh menang</malay> eighteen <malay>senang gila</malay>
the rank so I think <malay>aku</malay> just
go back to ranking up [lah] I cannot stay my chicken lane forever right
okay [lah] I will rank I will rank
I also can like ideate do some research on #freya# <malay>sikit</malay> [jer] <malay>bukan macam</malay> full blast <malay>macam aku punya</malay> #vexana# <malay>semua</malay> yet if you hear my #vexana# right
and I like I the few times I play aqueduct but man I'm going I'm gonna hang all the way and zero death brewers zero deaths my kiddie is so high you she's the queue depth ratio you know as it
like I
the few times I play
<malay>aku dapat</malay>
<malay>menang menang menang</malay> all the way and zero deaths bro zero deaths
my is so high
she's the kill or death ratio
you know what's that right
ya so the kiddie [eh] like shows your survival later but !wah! I tell you when you play [lor] ringing like
ya so the like shows your survival rate [lah]
like !wah! I tell you when you play low rank right
like it's so it's so easy so like
(um) <malay>tak payah fikir tak payar fikir sangat</malay> [lah] some more #vexana# is like slow kind
but when you play low rank the players are also slow
so <malay>macam</malay> easy target <malay>gitu macam macam dia orang</malay> walking ducks then <malay>kau</malay> hunt <malay>dengan</malay> rifle then it's hunting season [lah] bro so like
shoot shoot [jer] <malay>tapi aku</malay> mage so ya <malay>aku</malay> shoot shoot <malay>gini lembat gila tapi</malay> target <malay>masih kena</malay>
<malay>alhamdulilah</malay>
okay I will I will stay stagnant I'm so long I'm having fun I'm flowing I'm good I'm gucci and I will I will rank I also want to challenge myself if it's I always play low rank then easy kill hunting season fun <malay>dia macam</malay>
it gets boring [kan] I need a challenge also
(mm) that's why I'm trying to find new heroes to play I try cyclops but
cyclops have so many weaknesses
<malay>merapek</malay> it's like one of those weak
majors but <malay>kalau kau tahu main</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi kalau kau tak tahu main</malay>
then <malay>ramai orang panggil kau</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [ah] jessie is bad which is not good that's why I left the sixty dollars game
but it's okay I I will practise because I did so much research back then
and my win rate right now is like sixty eight percent I think that's not so bad for just a few matches and some more I think back then
the few matches was like in epic
the rank and come on you don't see people play cyclops in epic rank unless
like one of those suddenly no choice you they have to take a mage so they have to use cyclops
you have to take a mitch whose entity cyclops nail kilo but so kilin so long you don't take our ronaldo aruna is bloomberg to good a good idea
then okay [lor] but so long okay [lah] so long you don't take aurora tho
aurora is <malay>lembab</malay>
<malay>dia tahu golek golek</malay> [jer]
<malay>dia belakang</malay>
and okay she's good but
but her damage is good but
dude she's too slow man she's slower than #vexana# at least
#vexana# burns (um) <malay>dia punya</malay> target <malay>semua tapi</malay> like aurora
<malay>macam</malay> step <malay>lawa</malay> [jer] shiny shiny <malay>macam dia setakat</malay> over then I <malay>dengar</malay> [eh] <malay>tak nak nanyi</malay> let it go
to [jer] <malay>dia tahu</malay>
but okay I'm like try to play fighter and ex cause
my if I can smash button blindly and still win at #freya# if I were to put my hundred percent
I think I can
I'm invincible
okay since you have so much trust in my #freya# I will give it a head [oh] but
besides #freya# what else because you cannot play
fighter what is this dragon <malay>apa ini</malay> dragon rider
[eh] <malay>dia jadi</malay> dragon <malay>ini bukan jadi</malay> dragon rider
<malay>ini apa</malay>
dragon tales [lah]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tak pernah nampak</malay> character <malay>itu ini</malay> [lah] what's in the league
but okay besides fighter do we so need a tank I'm still trying to find the tank that suits me
because I'm someone who
what I say
like have you seen me play #balmond# I went to ulti on minion
I I don't even think the minion took damage [eh]
so like
I think <malay>kalau ada</malay> background music <malay>untuk aku punya</malay> #balmond# [kan] <malay>nanti bila dia buat yang</malay> ulti <malay>itu dengar</malay> quack
<malay>pasal tiada orang kena</malay>
but okay [lor] #balmond# <malay>aku</malay> think
no okay why <malay>aku</malay> choose #balmond# [kan] because when my sister (um) she just started playing so you have new characters to play
and like #balmond# is like one of those free [lah]
so <malay>aku</malay>
choose #balmond# [lah] cause I think not many people want to take tank if you really really start so low like you're low rank
then
I play #balmond# and then people think it's a it's a fighter but actually it's a tank so so you have like extra health
so
while I was on the filed playing [kan]
whenever people like it's quite easy to it's actually chase players
with a #balmond#
and then when you start spinning what they don't know is when you spin and you hit
the tank beyblade
you I'm actually gaining health so like what that that's what they don't know so you know my health is going down right but actually their health is going even lower because I'm actually gaining theirs but I only learn this recently cause I
I did my research on a #balmond#
okay at least <malay>kau sedar diri</malay> then <malay>boleh</malay> [lah]
<malay>kau jangan</malay> step <malay>jadi</malay> tank #yu zhong# <malay>ke apa</malay> dragon <malay>orang semua ingat kau nak</malay> dragon up <malay>ke</malay> dragon tales
okay [lah] [eh] the eye
(uh huh) ya I did my research on #hilda#
do you know they revamp #hilda# that's why it's actually
(uh)
<malay>dia macam</malay> hype <malay>sekarang</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia orang dia orang</malay> revamp #hilda# and like really give her
a lot of buffs from what I read which is
one thing is the health regeneration
regeneration when she's in the bush
so <malay>korang semua</malay> recall [kan] this #hilda# sneaky <malay>dia dekat dalam</malay> bush and she's just recovering health consistently
so like recall button #hilda# they don't exist you know
she's just like working out in the bushes gaining health doing push ups
[eh] but
it's twenty four K coins and I'm so tempted to buy #hilda# but I scared like !wah! I scared like it doesn't suit me but I like the
<malay>kau tahu kau dalam</malay> bush [kan] then you press this one skill later your speed <malay>laju</malay>
<malay>nanti kau</malay> zoom <malay>dengan</malay> #hilda# <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> muscle muscle <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>itu yang aku suka macam kau dah terperanjat</malay> like <malay>kalau ada</malay> music background [ah] <malay>nanti dengar</malay>
then she suddenly just ran out the bush running
ya but I will practise her [lah] if I but I think I'm gonna spend on shortcuts first [lor] cause like I don't want to waste twenty four K coins I don't have ninety coins in my wallet unlike some people I don't know what are they doing with those coins
<malay>apa itu dia orang nak</malay>
you save one million coin then you get bonus is it <malay>mana ada</malay> spend [ah]
<malay>simpan pun buat apa ini apa</malay> saving account
okay [lah] ya I think if we
were to put a real term on #hilda# it's like all of a sudden [kan] <malay>kau tengah buat kerja</malay>
then all of a sudden <malay>ada</malay> one train railway rail suddenly all of a sudden right a railway underneath appear under your feet then suddenly one train coming towards you then obviously you at the railway how to run right [ah] <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dah ada tempat</malay> protector <malay>semua</malay>
so <malay>dah</malay> [lah] <malay>habis</malay> [lah]
well but I don't know [lah] I don't know how to get her I think I need to farm up like farm faster cause I don't know when I'm a tank right I always keep thinking of supporting
other players but players don't support me and I that that that actually kinda applies in real life so
apparently
life imitates art
#hylos# I don't
I mean the reason why I don't like #hylos# cause there's this thing where he does is that he will use his own
was it mana to like like be a
a working furnace where he just burn like he's burning himself to furnace constant consistently then <malay>bila</malay> mana <malay>dia habis</malay> [kan] then
you burn your health then <malay>macam</malay> like you the tank so like people already burning down your health then <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>kau dah tiada</malay> mana then <malay>kau pun</malay> burn down
<malay>itu dah</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> double edged sword [lah] <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>kena macam</malay>
lost world <malay>itu</malay>
that's why I don't like #hylos# I mean ya he's thick
but
that kind of a skill takes
people who knows how to gauge when
to fight
then when to retreat and then went to fight again and then retreat
where as #hilda# is like okay retreat then you go to the bush then you work out work out and exercise <malay>minum</malay> protein <malay>semua</malay>
then you go into the field full health
<malay>itu lagi macam</malay>
but I need to practise #hilda# I so so scared <malay>dia orang pun</malay> debuff #hilda# [eh] cause it's like legit a lot of players are playing #hilda#
why why do they ban uranus though I mean like he's such a
he's such an undervalued hero being played in low rank then when you go meet ranks suddenly <malay>dia orang</malay> ban <malay>macam tak</malay> make sense [lah]
unless
no [lah] [ah] ya it doesn't make sense but besides uranus <malay>dia orang</malay> ban <malay>siapa</malay> like basic gusion
worse [eh]
(um)
is it the ban benedetta
I think
what is the new ban like new players
I thought it has always been three heroes being ban
[oh] [ah] [lah] actually cause I think only the last
two hero last two players of the team gets to choose who to ban is it
[oh] no wonder then
(mm) then I guess #hilda# is might be my next choice in
buying
with my poor twenty four K coins left because I don't have savings in a game account I mean why who would do that
who why why would you [oh] ya cause they don't know how to play new hero
[oh] cause did not admit cause <malay>dia orang tak baca dia orang tak tahu baca dia orang suka</malay> smash smash button <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>entah masuk</malay> meeting <malay>macam mana itu</malay> kidding [lah]
or am I
(mm) but anyways besides
a tank
speaking about a tank
<malay>nak buat apa dengan kita punya</malay> container tank <malay>itu</malay> [eh]
I mean staycation is in january tho

he's already boosting my company okay cause like dude he is like always grabbing like he really don't mind spending twenty six dollar on himself just to grab
it's cause he feel bad that I didn't get a grab home

at night so I don't know why he so
adamant into

okay okay since we're not gonna bring rice cooker [kan]
but you say you need rice you need your rice then we have all the
so they have pots and pans then
is it safe to say that we can
cook rice in the pot and pan
like a natural rice cooker we do it natural way even though it's electric fire but still

okay wait wait #haizat# don't eat spicy [ah]
[oh] my god
<malay>nanti</malay> you take over cause I might just end up
seeing a lot of negativity about him
ya I feel like I'm just I'm just like talking bad about that all the way
but did I lie
I did not
so
it's facts be [ah] I did sidetracked but it's not like
[oh] and do you know that he is he is
do you saw the who who and the care bear thing right
okay do you know that he's actually
he fully endorsed her to wear both
cause he say it's cute
and then he say can he say he say he don't mind wearing also
I am and I I'm I I'm like
you gonna spend eighty five dollars on a care bear <malay>punya baju</malay> okay wait if you want to buy the <malay>baju</malay> just the <malay>baju</malay> and then you wear like jeans
I mean I mean if you're happy if you happy that ya go go ahead
but you want to you want to get the shorts as well then
I don't know I just have the urge to throw a rock at you
and then I told him
if you really don't mind wearing that care bear shirt [oh] my god I'm side tracking if you don't mind wearing that care bear
[kan]
you one day when we and we meet who who
but we don't tell her that
that you bored but you wear you wear both set like the shirt and the pants I will pay
then we meet who who now want to see I want to see these two
these two species in their own natural habitat and how they interact cause like I don't understand
why why why would you spend on that care bear <malay>baju</malay> and then wear outside
but why would you also spend so much just to wear inside of your house so obviously you'll be wearing outside at some point [kan]
but the shorts you got to go though
the shorts is a no no
okay I'm side tracking back
I'm just letting you know that
#haizat# agrees
with the care bear <malay>baju</malay> and <malay>seluar</malay>
and I cannot imagine him wearing it cause he have very long legs so it's going to look extra
extra
weird on him I don't know I imagine spongebob <malay>kaki pakai</malay> care bear shorts
!whoa! you're only questioning it now dude you should have been [oh] okay and another thing he he actually also agree that you and him are like two peas in a pod
I don't know ya actually you guys are [oh] my god ya you guys are just that ya different taste one K pop one is like I don't know western artists I guess
why am I the only different one why am I always the one that is just meeting either one of you !huh! what is this can you all please
do a collaboration someday or something !huh!
no [lah] just kidding [lah]
I am the the glue to
what are you two (um)
amoebas
okay wait so
before they I don't know where we're going with this but
going back to our stay cay plans part two
(err) okay first day <malay>kita</malay> check in then <malay>lepas</malay> check in
[eh] no no first day <malay>lepas dah</malay> pack
then we meet up earlier cause I know #haizat# won't be sleeping
then we have lunch then after lunch we check in
then <malay>lepas dah</malay> check in
then we put our stuff
then I'm pretty sure we're going to be like !wah! look at the bed
!wah! look at the sofa !wah! look at the dining table so after we're amazed by literally everything and anything then
(mm) I'm quite concerned because #haizat# haven't slept or rest yet
so I think
I think we can save to say <malay>kita</malay> rest
first on the first day
then after resting on the first day
dinner <malay>kita makan luar</malay> like around the area just get the feel of
the feel of where we are
then <malay>lepas itu</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> (um)
we can go container gym
but I think I would rather just go back to the container and we just
take in the feel of how it feels like to be living in a container
no I think okay since before that right like on the first day <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>dah lepas makan</malay>
then <malay>kita</malay> rest <malay>balik dekat</malay> container then the gym is not that far then I'd rather we just gym at night
then because I feel that we're the type of people who actually stay up night to just talk about anything also so can we at least like keep a limit we we keep it like three then we sleep like
five hours no need go gym in the morning [lah] I rather gym at night also I think we're all gymers at night
[oh] wait <malay>tapi kau takut kau takut kau takut</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau nak pergi</malay> okay okay <malay>pagi</malay> let's go <malay>pagi</malay> gym <malay>pagi</malay> gym <malay>aku lupa</malay> sorry
okay okay <malay>kau lari</malay> [kan] so me and #haizat# <malay>kita dalam</malay> gym <malay>kau lari dalam</malay> container [lah] <malay>kita buka</malay> window so we can see each other
<malay>nak tak</malay>
okay okay so
