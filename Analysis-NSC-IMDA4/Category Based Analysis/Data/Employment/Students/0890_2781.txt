cause like I went cause remember I told you last week the korean <malay>punya</malay> stall aunty <malay>dia kata</malay>
[oh] if by next week it's not
open yet that means it's closed forever so I checked monday first thing in the morning I checked it's closed so
!aduh!
I don't know what to do [eh] #mala# and me are like
halal
halal
okay then what was stopping you thought
[a'ah]
[oh] <malay>aku dapat apa</malay> <malay>ada</malay> #mala# and I saw like my malay friend <malay>apa apa nama dia</malay> (uh) #izzah# from #izzah# is from band remember #izzah# my
<malay>yang tu</malay> ya ya ya
and she was eating #mala# so
and she's quite one of those like religious kind of girl so it should be like halal [kan]
I don't know I was thinking of texting #rusydi# like
to either #dabao# or like see if she can like register us in that time we said I'm willing
to go the extra mile
to be registered in but ya
I did I didn't and I was like everyday I eat #mala# I was like
pray I was like to #allah# to count my blessings <malay>semua</malay>
you took it for granted [ah] that's why it's gone now it's your fault it's literally your fault
no I have you eaten there before <malay>kau pernah makan</malay>
[ah]
[oh] ya the <malay>daging mahal</malay> ya
you usually eat the chinese sausage it's
it is
[oh] ya ya I did take that
that time <malay>aku makan dengan</malay> #arlef# (uh) <malay>makan</malay> #mala# <malay>dekat</malay> I think it was last year
we got the like the duck
the duck <malay>rasa lemak dia sedap</malay>
ya it like flavours the whole dish
ya
ya
Ichikokudo #ramen# [a'ah]
your <malay>bapa</malay> never let you go <malay>makan</malay>
as a family you mean like family dinner [ah]
ya so I think to me #ramen# is not my
<malay>macam</malay> not my type of food do you agree
no like no the one <malay>yang</malay> at Ichikokudo
[oh] you like you like yours [ah]
no I didn't
to me <malay>rasa dia terlampau rasa dia terlampau lemak</malay> because <malay>aku makan dia punya</malay>
(uh) garlic #ramen# I felt like
the fact that it's garlic <malay>dia dah</malay> cut
the richness of the flavor [tau]
but it was super like <malay>lemak</malay> for some reason and cause I didn't take spice I didn't put the spice also why didn't you going as far as I didn't like wanted to be
I didn't like want it to be spicy
ya
ya stomach <malay>aku ada</malay> problem bro <malay>aku tak boleh makan</malay> spicy food period
ya
<malay>tapi</malay> I that time I [eh] you know [oh] my god I forgot to tell you about this
I bought Samyang light
ya
ya
(uh)
no because when you add less of the sauce <malay>dia punya</malay> flavor
it's lesser
it's
ya you can barely taste it
do you do you get where I'm like coming from
the ya the the the gravy
to me <malay>untuk aku</malay> because Samyang [kan] (uh) the normal noodles <malay>dia punya</malay> calories about five hundred
but this [one] the calories is lesser so I feel like I'm
<malay>kurus sekarang</malay>
it's literally about three hundred seventy calories
and the but the noodles are slightly thinner but it's the same texture the sauce is like less spicy
no but it doesn't affect much [ah] to me
<malay>abeh dia punya</malay>
but the taste to me the sweetness is a bit a bit stronger
<malay>sebab</malay> you know like you put it like there's less ties to numb your tongue
[oh] (uh)
your ability to taste is there but it's still very spicy to me I was literally still dying
ya
to me <malay>dia nya</malay> carbonara <malay>dia nya rasa terlampau</malay>
almost <malay>bukan</malay>
Samyang
<malay>dia nya rasa</malay> almost <malay>bukan</malay> Samyang and babe <malay>abeh dia punya</malay> noodles also not <malay>macam</malay>
something that <malay>aku</malay> eat
<malay>aku tak makan</malay> that kind of stuff
<malay>kau makan dia punya</malay> cup <malay>atau dia punya</malay>
no cup <malay>atau</malay> the packet
[oh] <malay>aku</malay> prefer <malay>aku</malay> think there's a like a
[ah]
the packet [one] not the cup
the cup [one] I feel like it doesn't like <malay>kau</malay> try <malay>makan</malay> Samyang cup <malay>biasa</malay> not even carbonara the texture <malay>semua lain</malay> [what]
<malay>kenyal kenyal</malay>
[oh] okay
<malay>kenyal kenyal</malay>
no <malay>kenyal</malay> is like (err) <malay>perkataan yang betul</malay>
serious
[ah]
<malay>kenapa</malay>
[oh] you <malay>kau tengah</malay> looking through universities [eh]
#paolo# <malay>kat</malay> yes correct
(oo) <malay>aku</malay> (uh) <malay>dia punya</malay> course is (uh) sciences <malay>sosial</malay>
ya
(um)
<malay>kejap</malay> [eh]
(mm) bachelor of
[oh] <malay>dorang ada</malay> human resource <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>tapi aku aku tidak</malay>
<malay>begitu</malay>
passionate <malay>tentang</malay> human resource
to be honest ya to be honest
okay <malay>aku</malay> I I know <malay>akan</malay>
sound a bit <malay>dunia</malay>
I don't know <malay>tapi sebab</malay>
<malay>macam aku</malay> really <malay>nak</malay> try <malay>pergi</malay> overseas [ah]
<malay>aku</malay> just thinking because it might it's not really plausible for me to go overseas because of finances
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> a real thing is it will take two years only if I go overseas
instead of three years I'm <malay>aku</malay> looking at western australia <malay>nya</malay> uni [kan] <malay>kat</malay> perth
<malay>abeh dia punya</malay> fees about thirty eight thousand
<malay>tiga puluh lapan ribu</malay> (uh) per <malay>tahun</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay>
if <malay>aku punya</malay> is eligible <malay>untuk</malay> scholarship
(err)
okay so then I would I can get ten thousand off a year ya so it'll be twenty eight thousand and I'll only be there for two years so it's about fifty six thousand
<malay>abeh</malay> accommodation I can stay with my uncle <malay>tapi dia punya orang</malay> was like <malay>betul ke kau nak tinggal dengan</malay> uncle <malay>kau</malay>
no like I I called the overseas education it's like a
they liaise with the university for us
ya I called ya
ya <malay>abeh</malay> when she was talking to me <malay>dia kata</malay> are you sure you really wanna stay with your aunty because I mean it's not really a good idea [kan] <malay>untuk tinggal dengan kau punya sepupu semua</malay>
[kan] ya ya ya
that's why I was just thinking then she said accommodation about (uh) eighteen thousand to twenty thousand a year
so <malay>aku fikir</malay> forty thousand extra that's
ninety plus already besides cost of school
true <malay>sebab aku punya</malay> uncle <malay>dengan aku punya</malay> aunty <malay>dorang punya rumah</malay> is
quite near to university [tau] like <malay>macam</malay> actually <malay>dekat</malay>
<malay>abeh dorang ada banyak bilik</malay> spare cause <malay>dorang nya anak semua dah besar dah kahwin</malay>
ya like for real ya
right
<malay>tapi kalau gitu</malay> I have to take a gap year <malay>untuk kerja dapat duit</malay>
ya
ya <malay>abeh kerja kat mana</malay>
(oo) period
period
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> start [eh]
bro
<malay>dah</malay>
<malay>dah kat dunia dah dah kat space</malay>
[a'ah] <malay>betul</malay>
ya attachment issues
#elisa#
[a'ah]
<malay>dah besar</malay> [lah]
(mmhmm)
<malay>mak dia nak ikut dia pergi</malay> overseas
okay
[oh] <malay>mak dia</malay> attached to her [eh]
<malay>kesiannya</malay>
no but <malay>sebab dia dia</malay> youngest in the family [what] so I think it's like expected [ah]
<malay>tapi mak dia</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> what I thought you said she's like financially like
<malay>tapi</malay> her mum let [lah] is it taking a loan
super smart okay
how her is like almost like it is like three point eight kinda vibes
no but if she has a four point O it will be known [tau] because usually that is like honour roll
people get four point O in their courses usually like
like is broadcasted to the whole cohort
like during the process do people like the does the teacher like favour her
[oh]
daphne also four point O
what
daphne is the one <malay>yang</malay>
[oh] ya ya of course [lah]
[oh] <malay>tapi</malay> when <malay>kau tengah keluar dengan kawan kau</malay> do you guys talk about <malay>pelajaran atau</malay> completely like no
[oh] so your yours are just casual friends [ah] like <malay>bukan</malay> competitive
vibe
(mmhmm)
[oh] <malay>korang macam</malay> united [ah]
[oh] okay
ya
make enemies with a snap of a finger
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay> #elisa# <malay>dia nak pergi</malay> university <malay>mana satu</malay>
[oh]
<malay>dorang ada</malay> plan
[oh]
down to the T I guess
ya
(mm)
[oh]
[a'ah] yes
ya
<malay>tapi</malay> #elisa# <malay>mak dia bagi tak kalau dia nak</malay>
<malay>menyambungkan pelajarannya di luar negeri</malay>
okay okay okay I mean everyone has that like dream that they want to go overseas right
<malay>kerja sana</malay> [kan]
<malay>kau tahu tak</malay> the main <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> that people <malay>nak pergi negeri lain</malay> [kan] is because <malay>dorang nak</malay> migrate [tau]
like for example [kan] <malay>aku pergi</malay> (uh) perth for university there most likely I would want to settle down there also
that kind of like no as in like if people go <malay>macam</malay> for
like (uh) someone from singapore <malay>dorang nak</malay> (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>belajar kat</malay> america boston university
like why would they want to come back because their university degree cert is mostly applicable there [what]
so it's like it's meant to like <malay>macam</malay>
facilitate <malay>dorang untuk keluar negeri kita</malay>
ya
so <malay>macam</malay> like the thing about <malay>ambil</malay>
loan right is a very risky
I saw this (uh) tweet <malay>pasal</malay> this guy they took a hundred thousand loan <malay>tak salah aku</malay> hundred thousand <malay>ke</malay> hundred fifty thousand <malay>untuk</malay> (uh) go to <malay>apa</malay> university <malay>di</malay> america
I don't I don't think singaporean I think it was from china I I can't remember [ah] I honestly can't remember
<malay>abeh lepas tu</malay> he he they took a very big loan right but he got a job starting salary <malay>tujuh ribu</malay>
ya so within like five year he can pay it off
so it's like <malay>macam</malay> the starting pay is a lot [what] seven thousand is a lot [eh]
ya I mean if I feel like in <malay>negeri</malay> america
<malay>dorang nya</malay> starting pay quite high [seh]
[oh] ya they have minimum wage ya that's right that's right
singapore like university degrees I think like three thousand like I find that quite like
low [ah] to be honest
which one
that's all [ah] he can pay it off in five years it's like a it's like a return on investment kind of vibe [ah]
<malay>untuk</malay> [ah] <malay>aku punya</malay> perspective
no <malay>bukan</malay> hope it's more of worry <malay>macam</malay> if <malay>aku pergi</malay> overseas education what if <malay>aku tak boleh bayar balik</malay>
right ten year <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
but ya
but it's still a bit risky [ah] like what if I can't find a job
[kan]
ya but I mean I'm just putting it out there into the universe about the overseas thing
cause I'll obviously try my best to go into a local [lah]
like no matter what
(mmhmm) <malay>abeh</malay> ya
it's quite scary [ah] to be honest
go overseas and everything
ya
not really I didn't make much memories that's why I want to make sure <malay>aku punya</malay> university <malay>aku</malay> make as much memories as possible
<malay>kalau boleh aku nak</malay> give it another run [lah]
(um)
not choose my class <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] time <malay>aku masuk</malay> poly I actually chose to be in O two
like my class is number two like there's five classes so O one O two O three O four
ya
and that time #dina# was my only friend <malay>kawan aku satu</malay> [jer]
so <malay>aku was like</malay> okay let me just be in the same class as #dina# but if I were to redo it again I would appeal into the same course I don't know
but I would not choose a class
[kan] what course right
I think <malay>kalau boleh</malay> aerospace [sia]
ya because you did you know that I have a passion for planes right
foundation no because they will reteach A math A math is in year one again
of polytechnic ya
ya
but ya so about local university <malay>kau nak pergi mana satu</malay> and like

<malay>dia</malay> business vibes [ah]
[oh] ya
ya period
[oh] <malay>tentang</malay> addison rae
<malay>aku</malay> just I think I'm <malay>aku</malay> just
inspired by addison rae
<malay>dia seorang</malay> businesswoman <malay>yang sangat gigih</malay>
she does so much like work
<malay>dia jumpa</malay> kourtney kardashian
<malay>aku rasa</malay> [kan] <malay>dia yang paling banyak</malay> (um)
drive ya
and personality
<malay>dia punya dia seorang yang sangat gembira</malay> all the time
do you agree
[oh]
[oh]
[oh] ya
no no the thing the thing <malay>yang aku sedikit marah</malay>
[eh] <malay>marah</malay>
the TikTokers in general
<malay>kau</malay> do you know #avani#
do you notice how
<malay>dia sangat bosan</malay>
as a person
super
<malay>kau pernah nampak</malay> videos <malay>dia tak</malay>
no no no <malay>kau pernah nampak video dia tak</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> james charles [eh]
no <malay>aku rasa</malay> the only reason I mean I know you say <malay>jangan tengok</malay> video <malay>dia kalau tak suka</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi</malay> the only the thing is I don't think <malay>dia</malay> deserve all this fame
no she is
she is like serious she has like millions
I know #avani# is not as famous as the rest
<malay>dia punya</malay> ya
<malay>aku tengok dia</malay> collab <malay>dengan</malay> james charles [tau] <malay>di</malay> YouTube
and when they were talking she was completely <malay>sangat bosan</malay> as a person like I literally <malay>macam</malay> couldn't
even james I feel like james couldn't even like hold conversations with her
like as a person she doesn't have that personality that
is linked to a influencer
ya she's just like any other introvert
who just got this fame and then she doesn't know how to talk like at least with all these you should learn how to talk right
but you don't
ya <malay>abeh</malay> charli #d'amelio# <malay>pun aku rasa</malay> she don't deserve I mean she's a good dancer
she's a good dancer but does she deserve hundred million do you agree
<malay>ni</malay> something <malay>yang aku</malay> have been thinking about [ah] serious
ya nice but does nice deserve hundred million followers <malay>kau kata</malay> yes <malay>ke tak</malay>
ya because it it literally convert
okay
to be on a record like none of the TikTokers because it literally it's just fifteen second videos
it's just fifteen second videos I think
no <malay>aku rasa</malay> okay what makes me like a bit angry about charli #d'amelio# is <malay>dia punya</malay> latest video <malay>dengan</malay> maddie #ziegler#
the <malay>dorang buat</malay> makeup
<malay>dan</malay> the way she talk is so soft okay soft can be a good personality but it's like no substance and like no
ya but if you have this fame you should at least learn [lah] to
ya that <malay>itu apa apa aku fikir</malay> [lah] <malay>tentang situasi ini</malay>
ya
ya
but then again their net worth is like <malay>berapa</malay> million so <malay>aku</malay> have nothing on them
ya period bro nothing on them
ya
ya
do you think she's interesting
no when when we talk about influencers we don't talk about talking to them do you think they have a lot of personality because that's like the
a main selling point like james charles he's so interesting
no he has an it factor
that's what I'm trying to say
ya
he's
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay <malay>aku faham</malay>
<malay>cuma aku</malay> just (uh) <malay>aku baik dengan dorang aku aku</malay> think <malay>dorang sangat</malay>
(um) talented
<malay>dorang dah dalam bidang menari dan</malay> stuff like that
<malay>tapi</malay> I just don't think they deserve this much followers [lah]
based on how they talk like they cannot talk they can't host like <malay>macam</malay>
like legit it's legit just (uh)
circumstantial I feel like because of quarantine <malay>semua orang dalam</malay> (uh)
phone <malay>dorang</malay> so
and I think <malay>dorang punya</malay> it factor comes from not talking it's just the videos they make
ya so I don't think <malay>dorang</malay> deserve all these big opportunities you know
<malay>yang</malay> (uh) <malay>miniman yang baru</malay> [eh]
[oh] <malay>yang</malay> trend <malay>baru</malay> [eh]
no I don't <malay>aku tak minum</malay> Starbucks [ah] bro
period
[oh] <malay>kau dapat</malay> anxiety <malay>macam mana</malay>
going out and drinking coffee
[oh] ya <malay>malam tu</malay> [eh]
fidgety [a'ah]
to naturalise to (uh)
ya
<malay>kau</malay> that time <malay>yang aku minum kopi aku nak</malay> pass out <malay>kau ingat</malay>
ya no is <malay>yang</malay> I drank the whole cold brew remember
I don't drink coffee I'm already cannot drink
remember
<malay>yang kita minum</malay> [tau] it's like that coffee drink
ya we studied at #ngee ann#
Coffee Bean
that night <malay>yang aku nak</malay> pass out <malay>sebab aku</malay> exercise after that
ya <malay>aku nya</malay> heart was already like dying <malay>aku</malay> literally was like
I don't know it was so bad like
it's like having an anxiety attack but like #intenser#
<malay>abeh</malay> I thought running would help it but running makes your heart rate high but then it like <malay>macam</malay> complicates things <malay>aku</malay> literally was like about to pass out
after that
like for thirty minutes later ya I I literally like I don't know it was so bad
ya
drink coffee at all that time <malay>aku minum</malay> (uh)
I didn't like I eat at twelve you know like usual lunch <malay>tapi aku belum makan</malay> dinner and it was already like six and I was already very hungry no snacks nothing
so I was like (hmm) <malay>mak aku ada</malay> instant coffee so <malay>aku nak</malay> try <malay>minum</malay> [jer] [lah]
it's the white coffee [tau] you know it's like basically caffeine like zero per cent [eh] zero point one per cent that kind of vibe
so <malay>aku minum</malay> then after that it was okay
but then I ate dinner at about seven thirty <malay>gitu</malay> like one hour later
ya
and knowing that I have like
caffeine like resistance and like all these like bad stuff
time <malay>aku makan</malay> dinner suddenly <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> light not light-headed [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
anxiety a bit
<malay>abeh tu semua masa nak</malay> pass out <malay>terus</malay> I had to like stop dinner and like sit and like drink water
ya weird [kan] <malay>aku banyak</malay> pass out situations [sia]
ya
I feel like it's worse that I didn't pass out because I get to feel everything except black out you know
so I feel like it's unfair like let me pass out bro just take me in
what
ya
ya <malay>tak boleh</malay> serious
ya
<malay>aku macam aku</malay> just don't drink air flavoured [ah]
if you do you like if you notice I seldom I mean bubble tea
that time I didn't drink for like (mm) a few months
but recently I could have been buying again okay usually I get
(uh) usually I get the like the like the fruity type <malay>macam kat rumah</malay> #amira# that time I drank
then circuit breaker I didn't drink bubble tea
ya
I like to drink passion fruit green tea

I have like five projects to do
(uh) no [ah] like in week six now is only week two
<malay>tapi macam</malay> we all need to start [ah]
[eh] <malay>aku dah boleh</malay> book <malay>aku nya</malay> test [tau]
<malay>belum sebab dia nya</malay> date <malay>tak</malay> suitable
have you done your simulator
you should do it ASAP [tau]
(uh) the simulator <malay>bukan ikut</malay> stage doesn't care doesn't matter
you just go to <malay>kau punya</malay> new bookings
<malay>lepas tu kau tekan</malay> simulator there's three that you have to go through
twenty five dollars each <malay>tak salah</malay>
ya it's it's basically just to get your money [lah]
it's so useless even if you pass fail it doesn't matter you just have to go through the simulator
then it will be easy
then you should do final theory ASAP also
<malay>sebab kalau tak</malay> like I like I don't want you to clash with school
final theory is more to me final theory is harder than
(uh) <malay>dia nya</malay> first <malay>yang</malay> basic <malay>dengan</malay>
theory
no it's different content also you memorise a whole different set
I think I took like two hours memorising everything

<malay>apa</malay>
[oh] student do not required to book simulator lessons for this course means <malay>kau</malay> manual <malay>tak yah naik tak yah itu ke</malay>
or maybe <malay>sebab kau sekolah bukan</malay> private

#booboo# and molly
(uh) molly (um)
#booboo# cheated on me with my brother
she was literally on his lap sleeping then I'm like [oh] my god #booboo# you're so fake
ya because molly molly is like that molly is exclusive [tau]
molly only loves my brother no one else
he only #manjas# me when he need something <malay>macam nak makan gitu baru</malay> he come to me
<malay>tapi kalau tak</malay> he ignore me he got attitude [one]
<malay>tapi semalam</malay> molly <malay>macam manja dengan aku sikit</malay> so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay

<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak suka</malay> #rafi# [ah]
and I'm right right
do you think my intuition is right
about people
no <malay>macam</malay> when I first <malay>nampak</malay> #rafi# I knew I I wasn't gonna like him

#dina#
ya my intuition is always right
no as in she's always sus she's always sus
wait what other things <malay>aku</malay> I remember like getting a lot of things right <malay>macam</malay> regarding all these sus things
ya
but <malay>aku</malay> feel like <malay>aku</malay> reacted accordingly though like
that's why I don't feel like super bad because <malay>aku rasa</malay> just #safirah# is like overreacting
not like in a bad way but like it's just #rafi# like
ya I do because I didn't wanna hurt her but
I just don't like #rafi#
which is right
ya <malay>tak</malay> no <malay>kejap aku nak</malay> explain <malay>dengar aku dulu</malay>
okay so basically <malay>yang pasal tu yang kita keluar dengan</malay> #xu shi# <malay>aku</malay> #xu shi# <malay>dengan</malay> #safirah# <malay>makan</malay>

say everything [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like why you do this to #safirah# and all <malay>abeh</malay> #safirah# was like no
but then she was like [oh] but you know what you know what I actually mean right
ya
so I got I got what she's trying to say but this thing that happened yesterday what I messaged #rafi# in private
is a separate issue
ya it is impulse it's a separate thing it's not like
what I'm gonna do you know

<malay>abeh aku macam aku</malay> I know #safirah# <malay>dia terlampau</malay> serious <malay>untuk</malay> relationship
<malay>kahwin</malay> which is good
is <malay>bukan perkara yang jahat</malay> [tau] <malay>untuk buat gini</malay>
<malay>tapi aku rasa dia terlampau</malay> serious when the guys are literally like
seventeen years old
<malay>mana macam</malay> it's <malay>macam tak</malay> add up <malay>gitu</malay>
like <malay>dia nak</malay> settle down <malay>sekarang</malay> which is so unrealistic at this modern day and age
ya
like when <malay>dia</malay> message <malay>dia kata</malay> [oh] <malay>kenapa semua orang</malay> <malay>atau semua orang masih sekolah</malay>
then like what are you expecting you know what I mean
she's nineteen [lah] I mean like <malay>kalau nak kahwin</malay> at least twenty three <malay>baru</malay> find a real like a serious [one] [lah]
I feel like it's a bit <malay>macam terlampau cepat</malay>
and it's like she shouldn't be finding for a boyfriend right now (uh) like in all honesty
my mum my mum said <malay>macam</malay> you shouldn't like you gonna break your heart
like she's gone through two you know how like heartbreaking it is like I cannot even fathom
you know what I mean like it's so tiring to like go into this cycle <malay>macam kau percaya orang ni</malay>
<malay>abeh</malay> last last <malay>dia pecah</malay> [kan] <malay>hati kau macam gitu</malay> [jer]
ya it's so unfair for her [ah]

like most likely you won't be out there <malay>macam</malay> looking for like
love
elsewhere you know like you will get it sufficiently from your home that kind of
no <malay>macam</malay> like falling like for the first guy you talked to that kind of vibe
ya
that was (uh) <malay>itu yang terjadi kepada</malay> #irfan# <malay>apa</malay> the first time also
it's just sad for her
<malay>dia punya dorang nya</malay> family messed up [kan] #irfan# <malay>nya</malay>
