apa you belajar kat sana
then which one which one your most favourite ah mana satu
my course ah my course is uh also known as apa uh marine engineering
like dia macam um okay so basically
like my job progression kan lepas
err apa err diploma kan is like working either apa the sailing or or at a shipyard gitu ah
okay for third year aku rasa uh aku what ah
so like um for me I I pick the shipyard job ah because I heard of like very good like uh what response from like my seniors say like shipyard is good over sailing ah because you know sailing got like a lot of commitment you know like for sailing uh bila kau sail kan uh macam
enam months like that
six month gitu ah away from your families lah which I don't think I personally think I cannot ah you know
but it's definitely something aku macam look forward to ah like in in the future ah gitu
then also apa eh okay um apa dia eh oh okay
but like I planning to ah so now apa eh uh my first year kan ah I only got to like try out the different ah so like we all can like
apa choose ah the various types of sports or
kat sekolah we you can choose ah so I for the for me I pick the apa floorball lah like something new lah for me like I never try before ah
apa eh uh
quite fun ah you know enjoyable your ah kawan kawan you know quite fun ah
apa sport I prefer
ah apa eh okay got offer quite a few sport ah
you know you got apa soccer and basketball got tchoukball gitu
but I I don't know ah for poly I maybe won't pick like apa eh
uh clubs as in macam
got like the engineering dia ada punya business
then macam
I was planning to join ah in the first year tapi
apa eh uh tak dapat like you must go for apa
like I talk banyak tau
I like talk a lot for the interview but then I tak dapat you know
but hopefully if I tried apply again dapat ah
like for your course other than like programming gitu
for me personally kan uh I enjoy the apa workshop ah not for like year one
because I apa secondary school I pilih ah what as my elective I pick D&T okay design and technology ah
so like for me is uh is fun lah cause it's actually something new ah some s- some of the what uh workshop practice or something you like welding uh you got the two types of welding macam gas welding ngan apa
arc welding ah something new ah then I macam lepak lepak you know
but err on workshop cause I workshop ah aku rasa macam four hours ah gitu
then okay for my course right uh they got year one for year one to year two they only have like workshop practice you know like they equip you with like uh different kind of apa eh dia punya skills ah
err apa they
it's another workshop but the that workshop right is like dia macam ada
if you just go for interview eh no sorry my bad but instead of interview apa eh uh internship when you go for internship err what without any skill how you gonna progress right know what I mean
uh purifier room okay purifier room is macam like they do the heating of the main engine all that right so in this room right err you are given if I'm not wrong is part of a test ah it's like they are given five minutes to fix all the valve properly to the pipes
if I'm not wrong kita will be in groups of five people five people so you have to like maintain the piping system
but for me because I choose shipyard it doesn't really concern me ah cause shipyard job it's not like maintenance of the ship you know shipyard job is mainly macam like inspection you know like okay as
ape benda like other things I do other than in school lah
kay for me right apa eh uh in my free time I like to game you know
but then like okay okay firstly I start when I game right uh I start off with mobile gaming ah then I started moving to apa dia punya competitive scene ah
it was like in the early twenty fifteen sec- my secondary school days twenty two ah then the prizes macam uh gift card vouchers so like as a student I I would not want to miss out right
ya so you obviously ada experience kan
mm can lah you just you just go for it ah dulu
ah okay lah because like semalam I got study like the whole night you know like macam two
at three gitu I went for an appointment ah
how should I say macam
and it's like ya is what very what very contagious you know so it has to be treated then I read up read up then they say apa eh uh it needs to be like a surgery needs to be performed
you know so I immediately have to go down for consultation ah so like okay I pick today's date because I thought like apa eh
legit all the makcik makcik atuk atuk oi all queuing up lah
gitu then
once they cut open they take out the apa
macam a skin from like either of like my back right then and cover the wound area after incision is made
apa eh
you suka apa
uh do like apa small business eh is it is that what you do
ah ya calligraphy business when uh like apa notebook ah
what do I normally do kat rumah eh
the apa uh apa airports cover business obviously not bad ah the business the profits ah ya
like the apa the Paris Disneyland
ya aduh
but but then macam there would definitely be still restriction lah you know like beach maximum capacity
but then again if like apa dia punya deadline is like
I don't do right then my will be affected apa
ah apa our school work ah ya
prep you to for interviews in the near future have or not for is there like any course ada tak
like for this semester one kan uh I have this uh project called the module name is which is apa eh uh
so like uh we all macam is
uh two from then macam two from school of computing and two from school of business then they all mix together
for apa uh
macam a few weeks ago before our final group project so like uh it was during uh hari raya haji right
ask me to come at like what in the afternoon you know for me to uh help them with something and present then when I tell them macam I say I cannot ah I like damn busy today I got my
they should know the different type of apa
err the type of programs dia punya different types of software ah to do like animation ke
tapi kan I tell you ah these guys kan is even the girls tau
they diorang semua they don't want to do the work they expect the guys to do okay and they expect me to do when I come from engineering you know I have no background knowledge of apa different type of drawing you know
is to help people with depression you know so like apa eh uh we have to come up with an app we decided to come up with an app
more with macam err people ah online people online ah like strangers you know not in not strangers lah
so we decided to put in like some cute cute thing ah like apa the apa the
then our app also ada you have err what ah you have the therapy consultation tab
since our app is based on uh like I said the apa eh the macam Pokemon kan like the virtual pet right
it you you will get like virtual currency or coins ah basically like everyday you log in to the app you get five coins so what what can the coins do so our team decided to macam what I decide to do ah
so like the shop right we also have a shop ah the app also have a shop so it's the shop right we put err like the what ah poke food poke food includes like the apa
cause like usually my what when I go for interviews I rarely aku macam uh rarely know what to say ah
kirakan oh K K

okay then lagi siapa lagi dekat sekolah kau
aku pergi yang yang tepi funan tu
okay then um kau tahu yang macam rushaidi abeh humaira
dia dengan humaira semua sama dia sama class dengan aku juga then after that like he used to like me ah that time where we were we were young macam merepek kan like obviously kau just anyhow choose and like a person then lepas tu dia macam tulis a letter and then dia kasi kat humaira then dia suruh pass kat aku
I think humaira did but then she just tutup balik but then like humaira tanya aku eh humaira told me macam eh macam mana dia kasi aku letter sia dia suruh kasi kau then I told her aku tak nak aku cakap dengan dia tak payah kasi aku then after that she apa ni she insist she kasi juga she give it to me then aku buka aku baca then aku macam you know lah I like you lah whatever then after that aku nampak rushaidi was like hiding and looking
then then pastu aku nampak dia tengah tengok aku sengaja aku koyakkan kan then aku buang dalam rubbish bin
dia tengok dia macam dia tengok dia dah terkejut tau and he was shocked lah then after that he uh but after that he still continue to like me and you know he whenever I say like uh where's my block my teacher ask where's your block all abeh he will story to the class dia akan cakap his house is behind my block abeh dia cakap something then teacher ask which school do you wanna go then I say xingnan then he also say xingnan
ya bodoh kan it was damn stupid sia

aku belajar A B C semua itu aja jangan-jangan then yang oh kau punya is islamic school right
oh I saw kau ambil gambar lah
ya you look the same tapi but ada lah nampak difference
kat kindergarten
kau pun sama perangai macam eh
sekarang apa dah okay
but dia tak tahu eh
dia tak ingat he didn't even remember that
ya any stories dari primary school you went to which primary school
why korang never just start your name with like arina and diana
ya so sekarang orang panggil kau arina kan
oh ya abeh dia takyah surgery
kurang ajar sia tu
apa nak cakap like you grow out of this
ya last time I was okay cute then after that suddenly the you know period eh period pula sekali the maturing phase I oh my god I just look so oof but okay lah at least now I look better
ya but it was so funny was so funny literally funny gila
nice ke
sekolah kita is just not creative
primary five right starting of primary five I like this guy so much then I was I already prepared I rehearse kat rumah you know I rehearse how do I tell this guy then then I talk to the wall all this like pretending like that guy is the guy ah then after that sekali I met him in real life that time was Mendaki so Mendaki class then I told him ah I like him right then he reject me sia
you don't know who but her name was zulaikha I told her macam eh I like this guy sia then she she encourage me to confess to the guy you know I confess to the guy right then after that tak jadi then I told her semua then the guy cakap like he not ready all this then after that she like she cheer me up all this right end up you guess what two weeks later she got together with the guy
you gave me encouragement and all then suddenly kau yang get together with the guy
oh my god dia dah pergi dengan amira is it
see kalau she want to lie to you kan what is this
petty sia kau
zennis yang kawan dia iman tu she's muslim right
oh then kat luar it's already the swimming pool
oh she wear jubah
wait but right dia is she like religious
eh diam lah
buta sia
then after that why you all sit together dekat-dekat
but I actually want to know right how how you found the motivation to wear hijab like fully like what makes you
apa eh yang safi saw in this guy
okay wait I actually know the story okay tapi you just story I remember I remember the story
I can see that he's very introverted you know it's like very maacam senyap from his photo also I can see he he's a very senyap kind
tak macam how how you feel like okay uh from the start eh like when you just know him
have you ask afiq whether did he like really wanted to find a hijabi girl or
then how how you feel like eh boleh if I if the guy like macam afiq eh he talk to me like that he tak jaga my hati right I straightforward nah this is not the guy then I will just like stop it how how did you just continue
tak tahu ah I just I think my heart just not open yet you know okay sekarang ni orang kau nampak yang selalu marry kan you see like mira filzah also she marry someone she met a few times only
see sekali aku like twenty plus then I met someone yang macam betul-betul like god open my eyes
she can like him not for his looks cause he's more I saw his post kan he's more of those macam work kind of guy
that kind of guy the more pandai kind of person I rather more fun kind of person than
macam aku rasa boring though
itu ah macam I thought if mira with zizan right zizan is like he he's fun and entertaining what he don't have looks I don't mind sia
they say like charli you can just post anything what and people will just like it what she can just post a picture of her stoning and she can get millions of like gitu-gitu dah ya
abeh yang the bella that one she just
no lah you very kaku sia in front of
jom ah jadi agent rumah
exactly the rich yang tak perlu they get more stuff than the people who need need cause they want promote their products obviously can make this kind of people
eh not bad sia my only drop to two point something I think ni will drop some more
dia dah dia dah twenty one he start at nineteen
twenty habis itu twenty dia twenty one eh twenty
habis poly
then after that he have to go so I think twenty one dia enlist or twenty
let's say pergi twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty three dia akan keluar twenty three baru keluar
itu pun kalau dia straightaway like okay after this I do this after this kalau dia macam nak stop sekejap nak kerja
no cause that one is right I think is kalau I don't know ah I think because I oh is masters masters then you need that one to two years of working experience
bachelor is before ni kan before degree right
you should join before before poly my friend dah masuk NAFA now
so if I'm not wrong damn expensive though but kena kerja one year
he singaporean also he have to kerja one year and tak pergi sekolah for one month
tak tau dia kata tak dapat then he work starbucks for one year baru work
tak tahu lah dia suka ah dia suka
some more mak dia tak nak bayarkan he have to pay himself
abeh yang she study and she's good at it also it's good lah because like if you have uni you have uni like you have a degree then after that you will have higher pay enter only will have higher pay if not you're let's say if you enter with a diploma then your gaji is two point five then if you enter with a degree your gaji is three point five something like that
ya if not if you enter with a diploma and then you have to slowly work up you know macam two point five abeh maybe after two years later your boss naikkan gaji two point seven two point eight I don't know
so is kalau I just stop at diploma I can make like three point two ah if I go for a hospital
so they add up together dah seven K seven K is enough
bagus ah
but like I think for comfortable life macam betul-betul comfortable you don't need to think about financial issues right minimum five K I think
uh no it's the same uh like food but then another another shop so like she buka same shop
mana lah aku tahu kan
like I tried lah like my mum own cooking at home sedap ah takkan aku nak cakap mak aku masak tak sedap
ya then she learn she learn from like internet facebook all this I don't for she interested in this kind of thing eh like kitchen I am not at all then she ask me to help aku macam I don't like lah this kind of thing then after that she ask my sister itu semua untuk buka this kind of shop
ya you know yang kedai yang ni she actually wanted to
oh ya you actually wanted to tutup the shop and open because she want to open another shop but then end up she think back pasal her her work workers macam tak bagus her workers like take advantage like she pay her worker like seventy dollars per day
ya it's just like that I mean dia punya pekerja like the food standard is always macam tak constant sekejap sedap sekejap tak sedap that kind
my mum pay monthly four K orang semua terkejut sia
dorang macam how you make money here then mak aku macam uh cause my mum she smart lah in business she smart in business she just put everything macam orang nak taruk barang tu semua kan then they just tell people then she just put on her barang
so she just take everything and just put macam no matter benda tu orang nak ke tak just put lah like kalau orang nak beli
tapi because the shop is too expensive per four K per month then I tell my mum takyah lah tutup ah kedai ni mahal sia
like if let's say if you find another shop like one K plus then that three K can be yours then can add up to your three K can be six K already you earn then this one you pay four K to them just like that I mean bill kena bayar sendiri
bil api air semua kena bayar sendiri then aircon dalam tu macam rosak gitu so cannot feel
ya uh tak dia repair but you know the thing is kita tak ada aircon ah the aircon macam tak boleh rasa then abeh you have still have to pay for the aircon shit
pastu engine dia keep trip ah macam dia punya mak aku my mum say can only open like two switches at a time abeh macam mana nak masak cepat-cepat like two switch at a time kalau nak panaskan it's like very lambat kan
abeh lepas tu then they they thing keep trip the whole thing just trip kan tak ada lampu for like thirty minutes tak ada lampu tau then the person will scold us say I tell already right you can open two two switch
what the hell two switch abeh dah lah mahal abeh kau cakap buka two switch
merepek kan then mak aku dah aku cakap dengan mak aku tutup jer ah kedai ni then after that my mum macam sedih ah to leave the kedai seh like like the kedai then after that my dad already dah tukarkan the wire the whole wire because you know last time can open two switch now my dad dah tukar we can open all the switch already then it won't trip bapa aku cakap they use the wire yang lousy the wire like literally the cheapest wire
ya that's why kau buka tu switch jer dah trip
exactly abeh lepas tu bapa bapa aku yang buat sia semua yang the whole wire then he do by himself then like you know my mum already put in a lot lah for that shop abeh dia sedih nak tutup the shop then after that when we ask her to tutup she like tak nak ah then she say you know what if I continue to just open the shop then at least she say monthly she can still get three K what she open another shop then she can earn more what because she's interested you know this food food shit ah aku tak aku tak interested
jom ah kita buka sama-sama kau masak aku
right right kalau kita buka together then you can cook then I will be the server
kita how about we do western food and not
malay nasi
kita taruk mi rebus plus fish and chips
or like put like chilli crab punya sauce right
or we put um kuah mi soto
ya I can see you your love for soto ayam
that soto ayam
murah seh
malay food I like you know yang nasi rawan but that was so that is so good uh uh
but it's like at pioneer point I don't know I think can sit there and eat but then kedai dia selalu tutup my father always go saturday tutup sunday tutup then my father macam apa ni business macam mana nak buka ni kalau
pasal dulu it never close you know
mahal kedai tu is like you know that time they asking from sara for twelve K a month
ya sara says sara told me last time I was close to her juga what last time
yup because at first it was at four K plus after that they saw macam sara punya kedai always banyak banyak queue then long queue every time then the person keep increasing macam you are trying to benefit from people punya business
kedai lain semua dah tak naik tank
is cannot what cause that is the person's shop what kalau kau it's either you stay or leave ah gitu if the person say okay if you don't want pay then you leave ah
you imagine eh kalau kedai sekarang ni yang that twelve K a month you think they can earn or not after that
and like apa the shop obviously the shop owner dia sengaja nak sara punya father keluar that's why naikkan tinggi-tinggi nanti sara father cannot pay then surrender the shop
kedai tu ah
tu jer that's all you know
cause they always keluar gi malaysia all this together
now dorang ni ke
is either at home biasanya dorang masak kat rumah then they send to the shop
ya ya that's why maybe they busy ke dorang both at the shop
sekarang bapa dia bawa grab pe
should be business tak cukup or like they have a lot of things to pay ah pasal dulu kan the business very good
then after that sekarang dah tak bagus then the father ambil car abeh ambil motor berapa banyak biji motor dia nak then the father buy for the kakak the abang pun all motor abeh sekarang business dah tak bagus how then he have to grab ah bawa grab pay for all this thing because obviously all these you haven't pay finish what
kena bayar so it's either untuk aku your if I am the father I will surrender the motor then just use the car
abeh nak bayar banyak-banyak how to afford
tak lah aku tak boleh ah
kau berani naik motor macam nasib kau afiq ada motor kan nanti dia
abeh takkan kau nak bilang mak kau kan safi nak naik motor dengan
dulu aku naik motor dengan aku punya kawan lelaki semua mak aku aku rasa mak aku tak tahu at all sia
tapi actually aku pun takut aku macam dah fikir macam kalau aku jatuh ni eh kalau ayah aku tahu mampus sia
it's not like it's not the guy's fault what you also want you also want to naik
uh apa eh
uh econs ah ya and it was like so difficult but we were on a zoom with like seven other students then we all buat the test together
we just macam one student apa tu one student screen share dia punya screen like when he was when he while he was doing the the quiz ah
we all help him lah do the quiz then after that then we all collate the answer abeh kita submit
but lucky lah cause like I never study my friend also never study then we just action jer macam like uh A A I think it's A
huh kenapa
um aku tak tahu yang besok deepavali actually
tabbouleh eh kat itu uh arab street eh
boleh ah
I tried before also kat arab street but
pricey kan macam it's mahal
oh is it macam dia macam cake right eh no
oh yes yes yes yes yes ya ya ya ya ya ya I know what I know what you're talking about ah that one sedap seh
oh kat arab street also
baru buka oh
I feel like eating apa konditori dekat arab street
is it damn sedap serious ya
but its like damn sedap lah when I go there like aku always beli
oh dia jual ice cream eh oh ya ya ya ya but I never try the the waffle one
ya wah so today you jalan-jalan ah oh
wah wait you pergi dengan siapa
ya I just did school stuff cause aku belum habis essay
bila submit deadline
ya so that's why ni kena fast game
ya abeh rumah dia
my friend's house tadi
rumah dia macam sejuk ah then I was like sneezing
abeh but if she off macam panas
the kipas not strong enough
ya and then we just ya we just had lunch abeh supposed to uh apa buat our assignment ah then she like uh penat ah
ya then I was like eh I come to your house then her parents balik her parents balik uh apa dining cause we were studying at the dining table
then the was beside the dining table and macam their sofas and everything ah right
then parents dia okay I eat dinner ah abeh just on switch on the then we are like trying to study
I think but she wasn't even doing work so it didn't bother her lah and I also think macam she
dah biasa ya and she like couldn't tell that it was like affecting me cause like maybe it does
don't want ah so rude ya some more rumah dia like I don't want to say
uh apa tu last week did you watch the soccer game
tottenham siapa eh I think
dengan siapa I don't know who then um gareth
ya then we won apa eh jap let me check the score I think it was like
ya but it was like macam last minute was like a last minute goal ya
ya nasib but we needed it because after the
second was apa eh can't remember ah maybe like
everton ke apa I don't know and then uh but only for like half an hour they were top cause they had a match with um wolves dengan
but you had school or memang takde
oh then but sampai bila
your macam when's the deadline
rabak pe
then um oh that time you mentioned kan ah yang you nak pergi tu
but okay so if borders buka pergi tak
cause sometimes like even borders buka like still doesn't mean that you know can go right
but dah buka borders belum it's still closed
but anyway um I just found out yang the international business students in my course
uh they are supposed to I think in their like third year they're supposed to go to lah to to study abeh sekarang border closed right and also the cases rising kan
then I think cause I didn't know that we have another campus kat dubai
ya I didn't know that ya so then I heard lah macam I don't know if it's true or not macam the students will go there
that's why macam tak
that's why macam like tak dengar at all right about dubai like corona cases ya so
but lucky I'm not student ah cause anyway if in in any cases macam both tak buka or both not accepting like foreigners then you waste your money right
I remember that aku teringat there's this um guy in my primary school macam he he's from new zealand ah
ya tapi dia mix macam cina ah dia cina dengan
so last time aku ada this whatsapp group
and also last time my english wasn't that good like it wasn't great lah and I like my grammar macam like
uh sembarang right ya then after that
I type something I think I type like macam
he oh sorry I typed if I'm not wrong lah maybe something like she have kan salah right ya
ya then I macam at that point of time I was like rude
a'ah mak dia masak tak lah we ordered food
ya then she was like oh malas then I was like okay lah fine just order jer
okay lah I think that time also aku dua minit abeh aku hit curb abeh dia like terus suruh balik
ya mine also mine was smooth also macam
ya or not confirm like lambat gila
ya and the pakcik
I don't know I think dia penat
uh like some allied educator dekat but it's under ah ya
it's outdoor activity macam outdoor outdoor learning ya
belum she just went for the english test
but I think the english test should be final macam like the final round I guess ya then she will know lah ya
ya then kalau she nak ajar kat secondary then kena ambil degree ah ya
I suddenly macam nak apply for
at first macam
tak my ambition eh dengar my ambition like when I was younger was to teach macam like ya like I always know oh maybe I want to become teacher whatever
and then like and then throughout mm secondary school poly macam okay not so much like not so much of like I wanna be a teacher and things like that
then suddenly but now I don't know why macam I feel that maybe being a teacher is not so bad after all
so macam like what you do
oh okay so macam for example
so for for example macam okay you like a company wants to manufacture food ah so they will come to people like you is it
oh faham faham
macam niche lah right ya baik ah
oh anyway ya speaking of becoming a teacher like the whole point I feel that a career should be fulfilling right macam
I don't want to just ya like I don't want to just work for the money you know macam ambil duit abeh balik ya
as in nursing belajar nursing
but to be honest macam just take one thing at a time ah
ya I mean and she baru start kerja
exactly abeh nak ambil nursing
but it's tough lah I mean it's ya it's banyak nak kena fikir
no as in aku tahu ah
not in the in that regard but macam
don't know kalau don't know if like it's the right choice or not ya
so did you apply for the for the madrasah course
ilmu ilmu apa eh pengetahuan dunia dan akhirat ah gitu
and kebanyakan macam orang
duh but orang muda ya macam our age ah
it's not a syarahan it's really macam kau belajar buku like all the buku tak tahu lah dia like macam ada banyak banyak buku
kitab sure like okay sure ya
but interesting lah ya macam some like you never know that there are things that there are more things to be explored ya
macam sometimes the things that you know you think you know actually you don't know
ya so and it's interesting ah and the ustad funny
macam he's like the abang-abang type dia macam just buat kelakar ah like every single every single lesson
not we are not rapat lah but macam
as in like it's not like we talk everyday ke apa
ah ya like ya we are just no but serious macam in the whatsapp group like everyone's just like nice to each other lah ya
because macam not that productive
oh abeh
it's recorded ya so macam what's the point
if you wanna sit in abeh some of the students tanya banyak soalan and they can take up like twenty minutes you know just asking
cause I remember I was rewatching uh one of the videos kan as it dia macam just tanya for like like twenty minutes non stop
abeh lecturer dia boleh layan and he's a he's an old man lah so of course lah macam I think dia macam like
ambil hati and he would he will also macam just jawab lah all of apa dia punya questions
ya so ya it's damn unproductive lah but then again macam if go back on campus lessons only like tiga jam
but malas ya and jauh jauh seh tempat dia
but I tried going to campus before aku naik train
ya abeh kena stop ah dekat
ah boleh ah no
lupa ah lupa
tak pernah pergi but that time once I went there aku stop dekat I think bugis
err tak I stop at bugis abeh tukar
ya duh takkan I stop at bugis sia abeh kena naik bus
so but to be honest my dad said that like kalau my apa my kakak dapat then my dad will belikan kereta
just change ah macam siapa siapa like I don't know like depends on our schedule
no lah for what balik ah
ya fikir ah
but jauh naik public bus
satu kat kan
abeh the other one
but tadi I not tadi lah the other day I took train macam semua orang like rapat-rapat
ya no but there was like social distancing in the cabin macam they separate with those things
ya and then they remove like I think belum lagi phase two then they remove
macam just because like oh decrease ye ye o jer abeh tak ye ye o seh
mm kat mana
no tak cause that time I like aku lapar gila at like two and I want to order ah abeh like closed ya
no like macam ya
it has been right ya I get I think macam cause COVID abeh dia orang tukar
but that time aku pergi raimah dengan kawan aku
malam ah ya and it was like damn crowded then I was like oh I should have known ya
no but uh dia nak lepak that's why ya
then where macam like kat rumah kau ada tempat makan
but ya your place macam takde tempat like makan right
oh kopitiam macam masih ada apa
kat like your area
oh oh takde macam mama mama shop gitu eh oh
then besok kau buat apa
eh lah kau buat
oh wait so it's macam ah grab oh
ya but I think aku macam now that I'm schooling tak payah kerja ah
because susah apa
penat and also I'm not doing well in school
it's not I punya tak tahu jaga masa ah ya
not continue but like macam
aku rasa macam like everyone
macam lepak kat rumah all then so you don't feel guilty that you are doing the same
I don't know kemas rumah serious macam every single day I just like kemas rumah
like macam satu dua hari abeh macam last
no lah but now aku try ah macam exercise
no because macam okay that time I remember I was like
ya then my like my muka breakout seh macam
ya my muka breakout then also macam
ya right tadi you keluar
macam that's important
um ya nak besok
start sekolah
start oh tak
kan ikut time macam ya
dia orang ikut ah dia orang punya punya
I don't know I don't think so takde pun
I'm curious now how come takde eh
then your school macam usually is it two weeks
baik pe
penat seh I didn't know uni was this difficult
macam in like after after I finish working lah that
kan abang aku tinggal kat situ ya like macam just visit dia ah
tak um brisbane
ya but boleh drive to gold coast ah ya
but uh on the left or right dia punya driving
ayah aku just uh apa drive ah kat situ ya
and it quite easy macam I see lah I think it's quite easy
kat singapore tak boleh
kat singapore tak boleh
ada pe
sentosa ada pe
tak tahu rope eh
dekat kallang ada
oh ya life jacket kau nak pakai life guard
yes I did yang my dad even showed me a photo
are you serious seram pe
ya but I read somewhere macam
let's not look at western countries as like good places that like we can retire or stay you know what I mean macam ya
no I ya I ask her no I think I was like telling her lah macam oh I'm not so sure what I want to do with my life then she was like okay do you want to stay in singapore or like overseas
and then she was like okay for me I know that I don't want to stay in singapore that's why I study in cause I think she have plans lah to stay there ke apa
and I was like oh okay cool I mean bapa kau ada duit lah so boleh hantar kau belajar luar negeri
because macam our like surrounding countries like asian countries
macam for what
ah it's it just doesn't make sense to me macam
as in macam safety
and also macam when you settle down obviously macam you have family education here is much more better
much more better eh much better singlish betul
tak tahu ah dia orang nak relax ke
ya I think honestly I think they just macam nak that like macam kampung kampung ya they just want that ya that kampung vibes honestly
but my dad always like wish that he has a kampung to go back to
ya but I don't have but I do have like macam
um apa malaysian relatives lah then when we visit them during hari raya or whatever but now since like COVID cannot visit them
right macam okay lah
I think dia macam just nak experience not for youtube I think dia memang you know sometimes you have those kind of people that just wanna live off the grid
ya I'm like macam don't post lah if you're living alone quite dangerous what
you know what I mean macam any people can like if they know where exactly you're living like ya so scary
but berani ah dia tinggal kat kat hutan
probably ada apa permit ya
masak ah kat rumah mak kau suruh masak kat rumah tak nak
I I don't know ah for me macam aku tak suka um
but I don't know ah macam
western but macam I don't know
ya but europe macam quite dangerous now right ya
mm kalau I mean like
ya and the country also macam is it easy
but like like I said macam religion is the most important part lah so macam kalau
aku boleh like beribadah
but as in like he's he's okay lah gatal
guys kelakar or not
like macam he recognises the fact that he needs to relate to his audience
rabak seh
damn rabak
ya and then macam
ah best friend dia
I don't know but they say tottenham ada chance
but I don't want to jinx it to be honest because every time macam the fans cakap oh macam eh kita boleh menang abeh like always something else happens
and liverpool oh and also liverpool ada banyak players injured
so I think right macam this is a good time for other teams to step up
ya serious and like if they don't macam it's just a waste
see tengok man U is fourteen in premier league
jap aku ada extension
kau memang itu uh I mean do you subscribe to premier league
oh wait so now takde match ah
ya I just I just perasan
ada lah
ya of course ada
abeh kau menang eh babe sorry what
oh yang kau uh
tepi jalan kan
as in like they abeh ada satu pakcik tolong kau right ya
oh abeh kau lambat
tak I don't think so I think that's memang and it makes sense ya
park the bus lagi
oh okay kesiannya
oh sedihnya
tak nak join ah
takpe lah
it's a mood it's a mood dia tinggal dekat uh
oh itu jauh babe jauhnya ya allah
and then yes nak try sangat ah try dua-dua sekali lah
why not and so entah macam dah try dua dua dah cukup ah
dah dan rasa okay lah dah dah puas then I I
um cari jodoh cari jodoh who is next
I was like please please kakak you don't have anybody let me just try for for one hour
no no no no no no sabar sabar no no okay so the the um
I downloaded for her Muzmatch kan can so we just wanted to see how the app works right and so like we never put anything about her tau like macam
gambar nama jer like we never add in anything in her bio her profile or whatsoever and then after that um
err upload lepas like bila-bila masa ah
tak payah terus upload
yes ya you try you can just try now after that lepas tu like she just delete but then she still receives like emails from cross match cause it doesn't entirely
delete your account it just delete like it just delete the apps on your phone lor then macam the account is still there there's something about you what
kalau let's say you nak nampak more calon kan
he was cute he was cute tapi kan
orang-orang kat sana kan is really looking for
in dia punya database include international people
macam like
yes what what is that yes tapi kena bayar
to show that you are really serious and not like having fun you know that playing around Muzmatch tak payah
like I'm not the kind who superficially macam oh if you give me this this things about you list me this things about you then okay
no lah I mean sometimes dia orang K when I say dia orang serious kan it's like dia orang betul-betul serious want to put themselves out there
ya like it really just depends on your rezeki I guess
ah itu lah
oh ya ya ya ya but like first date you terus want to pergi trekking
sebab you duduk side by side
jangan date orang gatal
okay ya I agree with you pasal the movie like
kalau tengok movie tak boleh berbual and then you
buang masa like if it's a date like like first date you know that you buang masa like dua jam tak berbual then like
if you going out to makan and everything
uh no I feel like trekking nanti um
macam very superficial ya first ideal date ah I feel like
and then like dia orang masak sendiri you know and like so cute then they have like those picnic baskets and then like oh ya it's so cute
the mat tikar flat lay yes yes yes yes
ya so macam if you think like those cerita like or like I don't know like macam
but what if like the guy betul-betul macam very disgusting very rude
um so I I suddenly remember pasal you did you watch the smart local ya
by um catfish K catfish tu bukan kucing ikan okay tapi so basically like
ya do you watch like the netflix punya ha what's the
and then they will have like conversations bukan bukan it's not a cerita it's like dating reality
sekejap eh
many couples right only two got married tak salah I
I have but I have a lot of my batch mates dia orang dah beli you know
so it was about this article about this um malay muslim lady who decided to make halal mooncakes because
there are a lot of halal mooncakes in singapore and then her caption was like you suppose to hiatus already his her caption was
dia orang tak sedar diri oh my god
then kalau let's say kalau kita bilang dia orang kan oh
korang ada chinese privilege or whatever kan dia orang macam
kecil hati oh mana ada mana ada korang korang ni just oversensitive lah
I pernah ada kawan ni
dia tak percaya chinese privilege exists in singapore
tak tahu because is is okay
so dia betul-betul tak percaya tau chinese privilege exists
habis dia dia buat this long twitter thread pasal
it doesn't exist pasal oh um
budak-budak melayu tak bayar school fees untuk sekolah it's very very cheap compared to budak-budak lain
dia betul-betul usaha tau untuk
it's uh uh oh my god when I read it I was like K lah buang masa jer lah I baca tak ada apa-apa it's okay thank you very much
so kesimpulannya
awak a'ah yang
tak kisah pasal um
I think like dulu um
thursday asal
interview like the teaching like the macam mana
for a lot of times sebelum final like final year lepas dia dah graduate baru dia orang terima dia
kalau tak selepas dia cuba tiga empat kali tak salah
like setiap tahun dia cuba
oh bukan
medium or kecil
oh tak ya
oh tiger no tiger besar ah ee
cute gila
oh ada
oh is it the kind that you duduk dalam haiwan ya ya ya ya I think that's better honestly
kita orang yang patut dalam this cage sangkar
sejuk eh dua minggu lepas
err I pergi river safari with my family
boring to be honest uh is like the word like it it was kind of dumb cause kita orang kena bayar
untuk masuk the boar rides five dollars
they don't have the crews anymore so then the boats then kita orang pergi naik it just like a short it's like macam
ya kita kena bayar five dollars but besides that everything is like
kai kai masih makan jumpa makan makan makan
habis dia makan ya
so dia pun pregnant lah
oh ya dia makan banyak tau tapi yang the pregnant
ya so then the apa tu err
err kai jia kai kai kai kai dia asyik makan tau dia habis makan satu bamboo stick panjang kan
selepas tu dia dia crawl dia ambil lagi lepas tu dia patahkan dia makan lagi
the whole time dia just makan tau I was there for a good ten to fifteen minutes I just watch
eating and eating my god dia orang cute gila
uh apa tu apa tu kucing and also you know those macam couple couple buat video
no it's not it's because kita orang asyik tengok some videos pasal couple couple so the algorithm just
macam sedih kan
ya but like I feel sometimes dia orang post benda yang
should have just kept it to themselves macam something not everything other people should be
like something are just so intimate macam I recently saw this video pasal
oh um dia went through
miscarriage and then dia punya
teman lelaki tengah nangis on the bed dan macam dia tengah comfort teman lelaki dia I think
a bit dia ambil video on this stuff dia macam saja nak post jer then I am just like this kind of things in life are
uh I like when I watch videos macam dia orang
tunjuk dia orang pergi on dates tunjuk orang buat begini begitu cute cute
apa ah apa challenge
husband bila dah nikah bila ha
adam apa siapa tu uh huh
pelamin dia kat rumah eh
nak tahu ah
bodoh lah
emcee cakap um mari um teman-teman dan keluarga
um semua orang sila carikan pengantin pengantin perempuan hilang
oh my god that time my sister pergi kawan dia punya kakak
um majlis perkahwinan then it was cantik gila dia tepi laut and
it's it's not open dia bukan takde shelter it's sheltered cuma tapi dia macam how to say uh it's like kampung style open windows so there is a shelter but it's tepi laut
like it by the beach tepi laut kind cantik gila like dia punya deco and like the view
true true kalau nanti hujan masuk confirm mahal it's definitely mahal it's a it's a well-known expensive wedding venue no no K see I have
this rule is that kalau I nak kahwin actually takde majlis pun okay actually ya
like secara jujurnya majlis bukan untuk kita majlis untuk ibu bapa ya ya like because
ya orang kecil hati kan
terima kasih kerana menghadiri um bersama
alisha dan sekian terima kasih
she very lawa
she I beli her using my own money you know my own duit my hati my buah hati my baby boo tak payah lelaki dah just you got a new laptop life's great baby
you didn't do anything the entire day so perangai lembu lah
perangai what
okay perangai babi then
like you like if you just put it on top of your table it just looks rose gold like I don't know whether is I mata potek or like orang Apple mata potek I do not know like I genuinely don't know
so now officially girl girl is broke I dah tak ada duit I nak makan pun tak boleh you know I was like thinking of buying like
broke because the money is set aside for something what do you mean fake broke apa lan jiao kau apa merepek kau nak cari gaduh ke apa
lepas tu I
right since primary six I was primary six okay like I will like dulu kan my mum pakai tudung
so like dia pakai tudung then kalau dia nak potong rambut kan nak kena pergi to somebody's house you know to tutup aurat and all that lah
like they are like fucking far extended family kind of shit lah but like raya have to go to their house cause it's like some nenek punya nenek punya kakak punya some shit lah
like knows the auntie so like she will go like when she was younger to cut her hair then once I started like to pakai tudung in primary school my mom brought me there lah instead of like the normal kedai barber and all that
since fucking primary six sampai last year this motherfucker has been like forcing me to jadi dia punya
daughter-in-law dalam bahasa melayu apa
yes okay I keep on forgetting that word obviously menantu material right there but like she has been wanting me to be her menantu for god knows why like I'm so messed up I'm so fucked up but she still wants me to be her menantu you know dulu right when I was like like twelve nanti benda dia macam kecil jer ah macam she will be like
orh like what do you think of my anak like that like nanti aku duduk like dia kasi aku makan nanti dia cakap you think by the way his name is okay let's let's give him like give me a nice Malay name like he's actually decent looking he's not ugly
um she like ask me like what do you think of #Adi#</P2 then I'll be like like apa kau merepek like that is your son what am I actually supposed to say you know
then after that like I don't know about you ah but I don't know like what happened like it just started to escalate then like last year right I go and salam dia punya mak lah cause like I don't know why
then I have to salam the mum then
I salam dia nya mum and then straightaway dia punya mum was like
err kenapa lambat sangat nak salam mak mentua
huh sejak bila aku ada mak mentua sejak bila I'm like fucking nineteen and I was like
kenapa kau datang lambat tak nak salam mak mentua kau and I was just confused you know I was just like
lady hold up hold up I love it that you love me so much like thank you I sayang you also baby and you always feed me good food but like besides the point I have never even spoken
like is always the mum and the sisters looking at me up down ketawa ketawa gelek gelek sendiri and then like he's never there
I thought about that because I think I'm just dreading next year raya and then that is one of the things that I'm dreading ah
like I tudung and all that
cause every year I go to her house and every year she will like ask me like do I have a boyfriend what do I think of her son kau nak jadi aku nya
menantu ke tak that that happened last year lah but like you know it just escalates to suddenly I'm the menantu that's all
kan I don't know it's just like a melayu nya thing
like makcik makcik be really all up in your face be like kau nak jadi aku punya err menantu ke tak
menantu like girl girl doesn't like to cook I like to bake but I don't like to cook
is that a good menantu quality like
especially if makcik got a son that is like freaky
makcik I am permanently staying here you like me right can I get married now
you nak I sekarang tak I umur baru dua puluh tapi okay dah
I okay I budak uni
I don't know what else to say I budak uni
I suka masak
like I don't know what is a good quality to be a menantu in the first place
is it so that means what when you just register straightaway kau pergi primary one like you cannot skip anything is it
tak ah the only the only madrasah that I had went to was Andalus and then it was only until like what
so I go and boleh pukimak kau dia tak tahu ke
oh my god bodoh lah so the only vocab that he knows in Malay is
and like adjectives like sedap
and lawa
gila ya the jiwang kind of shit but then doesn't actually understand what's going on
oh no the motivation is gone padahal nak cari ilmu eh okay okay sorry sorry
like I solat I got clear skin I got good grades
it is scan scan tu eh
ah lepas tu
so wait he got he tunang in twenty seventeen he putus tunang in twenty seventeen and then he go and find her again
you know you'll never know might like still sayang and like I don't know like
okay what the what the heck he's so weird you want to meet your girlfriend but then you also want to berak then you don't want to berak first and then it's just like
I don't know nak cakap childish ke nak cakap tak ada otak ke tak faham sia
like first of all you are like freaking like twenty something and then you want to berak abeh kalau kau nak berak pergi lah cari toilet yang kau nak pergi kacau kau nya girlfriend cari kan toilet buat apa siak
kay wait kau nya boyfriend jumpa mak kau sebab macam kena caught is it like like terserempak kat somewhere then she's like no
lelaki tu yang nak lelaki lelaki tu yang suggest and then she was like ya and I was just like
lan jiao I've been together with a guy for one year my mother tak tahu sia
actually I also tak faham lah
so apparently they actually stated to each other both like both of them stated to each other like I'm not gonna play around but is both of their first relationship but then they actually clearly specify I tak nak main main okay and then suddenly I tak nak main main equals to you kena jumpa mak I
so like I tak faham girl girl tak believe it
I just tak faham I was just like
was the one who told my friend like eh I want to meet your mak
I just tak tahu
like he's not the one that you marry and then korang like wah full blown invested like I don't know ah I I was just confused I never would
so this girl like freaking younger than me had a boyfriend lepas tu buka bank account
sebab nak kahwin like they actually like
dulu I would do it dulu I was that kind of girl okay I wouldn't go to the extent of like putting my money
and you know dapat
tell you so messy perangai everybody semua perangai macam sial
I really never tried blue coral my entire life but everytime a Melayu comes by
I never tried it before but like the Melayu right god like the typical like if the Chinese walk pass you know they're gonna be like peach green tea lah the normal milk tea the Malays if they come right jesus christ they're gonna make me do ice blended at the back and be like blue coral smoothie chocolate oreo

the baju is green colour and then my tudung is yellow in colour so maybe that's where my name like nyonya telur came about cause girl girl imagine with that circle face and then the yellow tudung really not cute
the sekolah is in the middle of like a hutan
like then next day they went and like find out who the guy who the guy is like siapa lelaki yang cium anak aku you know it's like maybe I don't know
my yayi and my mum pergi ah pergi to the masjid and then after that they actually like found out the the guy that kiss me
it was so messy and then like I was just like I don't even know how he looks like you know sekarang I cannot remember like I cannot remember anything
they will just say you know lelaki yang cium #Syafiqah#</P2 kat madrasah
you know dia literally casually called the dude that name and apparently that he's still in my life
but I don't know who he is I've never seen him before but his name will pop out like my nyai will like talk about it to my mum
to tell her which is just I just waddle waddle up and then be like mama mama ah ada orang cium #Iqah#</P2 kat pipi and then I like went like this to my cheeks and all that and then my mother was like what the fuck is going on
and then my mum went down the next day with my nyai to go and see the guy and then apparently the guy like people will fetch your child what cause it's like in a ulu place
then when like I was maybe I pointed to the guy or something and then the guy was with the mum and then the mum barely knows my nyai
I cannot believe it ni perangai

apa ah what was it ah
macam make you make you wow gitu ah
asal asal still kena cause kau jiwa melayu apa
okay like in the future I kau
tapi like um
ah kalau macam like
um mix ah apa mixed racial marriages gitu kan then anak anak dorang semua mixed like muka campur gitu ah then
ya lah then it will never never end what gitu
apa sia lapan bangsa from where
like you are only from your mum and dad pe tak kan like you want to kira your nenek moyang semua
tak ada kau kata like it's not um
like it's not fair for like kids to have as if not fair for people to get based on their dad's punya race eh tapi at the same time kau kata like they shouldn't choose so
like kalau
okay kalau kau chindian kan like chinese indian then you want to buy a house then you know cause of the race racial apa tu the quota that one right
cause like kalau this one
dorang dah ramai gila cina
so kalau kau chindian then kau identify your like you can choose right then you identify yourself as indian then you can take but if you identify yourself as chinese then you cannot take cause
a'ah I I don't know if like we can jual like jual to melayu eh jual to india or not
then I know like you have to jual to like
uh it's like a social social inequality cause kita minorities selalu
okay ah I don't want to say selalu cause it's too like absolute but
uh banyak kali
chey dipinggir yes ya yes ya
ya dipinggir is like ah macam jadi outlier gitu kan
um honestly aku rasa
so aku rasa macam
cause kalau tak ada quota ni semua kan confirm there's like racial different like racial segregation ah cause like macam
kau imagine ah woodlands confirm kampung melayu sia woodlands yishun
yishun tak sangat yishun maybe like yishun maybe like chinese a bit ada indian aku tak tahu
eh eh kau takmo
yeah um abeh punggol probably
I don't know macam cina maybe
this like racial quota right is only applicable to public housing so macam all those like private private properties semua kan macam like rumah sebuah sebuah semua
dorang tak ada seh that's why like they can get away with all this like
ah like segregation so it's like in private housing private housing there's like the kau tahu macam dorm
that foreign foreign workers punya dorm so it's like
like ah for workers and from china semua they live together then from india bangladesh semua live together since like the segregation is there already and then also like in in like
um expats ah macam those orang putih then they tend to live in like bigger houses pe so there's the macam they are quite detached from our society
eh diam lah eh yes yes
um like I want the windows to be like top down kind ah macam macam gini ah and also I want a balcony that can look outside like can sit outside kind
then like malam malam boleh just

it's about eh dia punya main character nama dia irfan seh
ya and it's a it's very like easy to baca and
easy easy to faham huh it's not love story ah it's like a sahabat
ya kau dah baca ah tu
so beauty to me I would define it as personality and manners adab lah adab
mm okay look before kita start kan um
uh okay macam mana nak cakap eh um
so macam uh sebab kalau kita lawa pun macam mana
ten years down the road bila kita dah ageing then you know it'll be no longer as beautiful as you were
um macam for example friendship lah macam kita nak buat kawan baru kan
err tahu tahu
inshaallah tak
okay okay untuk aku kan because poli poli aku lah macam what I can observe was from my course most of them most of them like
macam mana eh um define
my course banyak cliques tau then um in the year one ya during year one we have this orientation kan so macam apa aku observe kan
they the popular ones they tend to find they tend to clique each other so like popular what my definition of popular is dia orang popular and then they are
macam for me uh in my course most of the cliques yang macam the big cliques right they tend to I mean they are closer to people um they
they are closer to people that macam ada good looks semua so macam
so it's very very subjective lah in terms of macam mana dia orang select uh friends and ya and how the friendship last till
but then like if we were talking about like general industry so macam teaching ke uh
ya design ke ataupun like social service ya F&B also then I think what is for me if I want to be an employer then I would first look like experience and like how willing is a person
it depends beauty macam
but I think that one also subjective because some people they they have this they like certain uh like macam for example for female right they like males macam
the lelaki yang ada certain features so ya so it really is very subjective but for me
aku rasa macam are we talking in like first first
um like kau nak share
okay uh okay untuk aku kan macam if I want to find a partner
then I would say beauty in their personality and mindset sebab macam
uh for me I place I I put more I mean macam macam mana eh my first first
how do you say it macam
uh for me to identify that person as my partner in the future I would uh my first check list is like mindset or personality so macam ya because macam
macam mana eh kalau kita uh kita tak
we are into only the good looks then like I said macam in apa ten ten years down the road they will also age then they will no longer look the same so macam to me I will look more in terms of the long term
cause long term aspect lah so macam mindset and personality so macam personality and mindset is something that your bring uh macam mana eh it's like since yang kau dah ada personality and mindset also so it's like how how how your personality and mindset um like
macam mana eh what uh your personality and your mindset is what attracts me most rather than your goods uh rather than your looks because for me I emphasize on the personality macam like for example ten years down the road kan kita dah macam dah kahwin semua habis kita when you have your children then like if you
okay uh firstly memang aku ada watak a lot of insecurities and low self esteem
then secondly macam
uh memang high punya
dia lebih lawa lah ah
before we go to the next question I want to ask macam
okay okay best ke dalam topic of friendship kan
friendship bila kita buat kawan uh buat
buat kawan for the first time
to me uh in terms of boys or girls I would say girls sebab macam
I don't know whether boys I mean they do have insecurities and all but they place more on like macam their
macam the friendship is base more on macam
like like you can even see like the conversation between girls and boys boys mostly macam I mean
not to generalize lah macam like boys they generally talk about like
uh apa macam like topics that are not so emotionally involved I would say ya
mm actually for that topic aku pernah lah belajar lah in aku punya course if like
macam what we think is a society it's not like um good but then it's still functioning so
macam is not on the same same bar but it's still functioning so it's still called like a dysfunctional it's it's called something functional something lah
rather than to have a society that macam everyone is equal but then it's not functioning in terms of macam they are not hardworking or they don't have any high hopes ya
disanjung yes yes yes
macam content is it the content they deliver
they they apa tu they are attached more onto the expectation rather than reality
lain macam extra
okay so for fashion um back in those days macam nineties eighties kan
macam the fashion do um I'm not really sure because I don't live in that era but like the fashion mm
err yes based on pictures also lah then yes it's very laid back and macam
like I'm I'm not sure whether it's true tapi macam aku nampak dia orang macam tak terikut-ikut dengan dengan the fashion trend you know so macam dia orang tak terikut-ikut and then it's not like everyone wears the same clothes wears the same clothes types and then as compared to now macam
we have like the uh what the term E-boy E-girl then the uh then the what type of new dress macam hipster hipster so macam
mm so macam
the no um the fashion macam mana eh do you think the fashion style and fashion trend is more
macam is more very very common in this era as compared to eighties nineties or fifties or like do you think they are both the same regardless of the era time so macam do you see the word saturated so everyone wears the same clothes and all
oh pasal journey is it
apa tu macam um right now uh
macam mana eh uh so if you so the current society sees someone who cares like who does like self
care then self love and everything and someone that is very like they are an alien so because society now is macam kau ada banyak kawan then you are in a big group
then you are seen as someone who is um ada ada uh ada value lah then ada macam ada tempat dekat society but someone macam just dia macam apa seorang
then dia macam pentingkan not really pentingkan diri as in they know what is the what they want in life and they they have like self love and self care lah so like what what you think of like um this society standard macam ya
that was jodoh seh
we ngam-ngam
and I think for our friendship also um we are not that judgmental like in uh between ourselves so macam
ya and our friendship is focus more of like sharing and kita macam banyak advice each other so so like it's really something
the negative side there's uh society standard then we share our own like experiences then now we shall like focus on beauty itself lah since beauty was so macam
ada okay uh ada kebaikan dalam kecantikan kecantikan yang terlaung
mm so it's like full package lah macam good looking very humble also
but I heard okay so that one is um macam kita kirakan macam uh role model yang macam
someone who is err so macam mira filzah dia macam actress kan
western eh uh aku tak berapa tengok
mm okay then for ni kirakan kita ambil contoh dari macam uh pelakon penyanyi semua habis kalau macam in your own
macam those not as
those not popular lah so macam kawan kau
ke or like someone
yang macam dia lawa and very like lemah lembut and all
it's something macam
ya macam uh kan cakap pasal uh apa tu
deen and deen and dunya so macam apa tu dunya means like world lah so macam
dunia tak di akhirat lah so
so macam aku rasa macam sekarang like budak I mean not to generalize okay but like budak-budak sekarang is more
aku rasa macam sebab macam singapore kan dia uh nak tinggal dekat sini memang mahal gila apa
so macam the focus more ya the focus more is on like the world lah instead of like the the uh afterlife
ya so like now now now is like very rare to find like those yang macam dia ada dua lah so macam dunya and deen
so like more macam be comfortable in your own skin
ya sure okay so kita tinggal like a few more minutes lah so like I would should we end it off with like a one message to our future self
okay so aku start first lah so regret aku is to be the beauty standard so macam dulu uh secondary one primary six semua kan aku macam very uh very insecure lah sebab macam
kita ada influence dengan K pop apa so macam kita nampak woo macam lawa seh and kita pun tengok kawan kita pun macam lawa lawa semua I mean kita macam tengok diri kita sendiri macam uh we are not there lah so macam ya so like what I regret was like uh
like aku terlalu pentingkan like kecantikan dari luar instead of dari dalam ya
um then jap
like I think message something like to to remind you during your apa macam uh bila hari-hari yang kau perlukan kata-kata semangat lah I would say
um the priority will be uh ke uh work live and
I think pressure in terms of like macam kahwin ke tak kahwin ke macam marriage lah so I think
I think the pressure will be more bila kawan-kawan kau dah start to slowly get married so macam you'll feel very pressured so um my message would be um
ask you and pressure you indirectly to do so focus more on yourself and say cause macam to to to learn to prioritise
do ask ask to do macam-macam
akak kakak last kerja kat mana
okay kak okay kalau kalau kerja kat situ kan apa yang akak pelajari
jadi kiranya kakak telah belajar lah daripada incident tu
okay kakak sekarang mempunyai um experience experience di dalam bahagian industri baking um kalau kakak diberi pilihan untuk mencuba industry yang lain industri apakah yang kakak mahu cuba
apakah yang menginspirasikan kakak untuk mencuba mengajar uh kanak-kanak yang kecil
kira kakak tahu kan yang kanak-kanak kecil ni kadang-kadang mereka akan menjadi susah untuk dijaga mereka mungkin nangis merajuk bergaduh jadi kakak rasa kakak have the skills untuk cope with this problem
dengan adanya technologies sebagai telefon bimbit dan tablet adakah kakak rasa yang teknologi ni baik ataupun tidak baik bagi kanak-kanak muda
kakak ingat tak bila kita kecil dulu bila kita around ten years old ke eight years old gitu bila tak ada komputer semua or bila takde handphone kakak ingat tak apa kita buat dulu bila kita time kecil
kakak ingat tak dulu beza eh sebab dulu kita takde netflix takde youtube kita cuma tengok live and live kadang-kadang if you want to go to the toilet nak kena tunggu advertisement
then remember last time you have to apa nak kena rush the toilet kalau nak kencing ke apa ingat
sekarang senang jer now if you want to go toilet or what you can just pause like sometimes if like I think about it kan like how did we survive last time like kalau you've to watch any shows you only have we have to look at what's on the schedule we cannot watch anything we want at anytime and then also last time there's a lot of advertisement like even now
like if you think about it nowadays we have a thirty seconds youtube advertisement right like you think it's a bit susah tapi like back then advertisement on is like two minutes three minutes and like it's a lot so like it's crazy how times have changed right
like there's only one computer in the house then kalau if the if I want to play then he have to wait for me and then like now all of us have our phones and we can just watch our show anytime you want you can play the game on our phone anytime you want correct yes
so kakak remember the first phone that you got do you remember about it
ya without a doubt malaysia food is good way macam

tak tahu apparently when she eat the TruFitz is it helps to curb her appetite
and maybe because she maybe sometimes she eat dinner or like she minum air so it makes her full
kau takkan lapar because I ate that for like one week what and it does help wah I don't eat a lot in during lunch I don't eat a lot during dinner
dah kena skip everyday
pukimak penat duh berapa kilometre aku kena skip
so basically it's like a blind cane kau beli ah blind cane jer
bodoh lah oh my god burns
ini burn sia burn apa tu dia punya tu tak
macam ni kita kena berbual for tiga minit
is the one after naruto mati eh naruto mati pula since when no sasuke killed roshi maro and then after that he went on a journey with this
zabuza punya student I don't know his name ya ya with the purple baju ya I don't know his name I forgot and then with the currin and they went to find juggo juggo is the orange colour
bye bye I'm just so patty and then kau kena cakap
and aku campak
kau kena macam nadira macam sasuke like how naruto call sasuke
bodoh lah
ya ya ya because literally kau boleh macam gini
so macam very boring you know and like some more all all my other friends like we want to meet up
if aku ada pagi punya kelas then she have petang punya kelas then if have if I have petang punya kelas then she have pagi punya kelas then it's like you really boring
lepas tu it's like how to say
it's very dry cause sekarang tak ada hands on cause of the COVID so kita tak ada jadi hands on activity
then I'm like central ada macam
uh childcare kat dalam kan tapi kita tak dapat pergi and we suppose to pergi so now it's like really dry and like err boring and all we do is like datang school lah habis kita tak buat apa-apa kita just do nothing we just like sit there and then we revise our own work
but then at the same time macam best sebab
dapat jumpa kawan pe
dapat jumpa kawan habis like
we go eat together sometimes tapi macam sometimes cause semua tinggal jauh-jauh so we cannot
do anymore but then college central still do but now because ah recently ada like COVID
case at college central so right we don't do anymore unless macam is online class tu pun online class we do like a lot of like projects like we research about the different type of sports and then we research about division of different type of muscles
habis lepas tu kita buat powerpoint slides about the muscles all lah
but ah then actually tak do like any like that is kalau kita buat macam project ni kan
it is counted as kita punya participation mark
so that is considered your exam marks so like sports and wellness we count that a lot somehow like we count that a lot lah from the projects that we do since we cannot do like real life cause we are supposed to learn like swimming rock climbing cause they all have like their facilities there but then we now kita tak boleh buat so we don't do anymore then we have like
I already took like test I think earlier this year cause we learn excel and then macam quite senang lah cause you just is given at basically it is given the answer is given like they ask you oh your chart must look look like you all like pivot table must look like that so it's actually given
but then cause just like you figure out how to do it so and then when we like in the weird thing kan pasal
each of the people can there's like uh over hundred like there's marks points but they don't tell you how much you get they just tell you pass or you fail and what's your final nanti kau your
kau dapat when nanti kau dapat tahu ah kau do like well ke tak then after that for my class like kan you can if you fail
or you like don't do so good kan you have the opportunity to retake your punya like test lah but then my class tak ada orang retake cikgu cakap like all did like quite okay all did quite good then I was like thankfully so we dah ketepikan tu dah lama diketepikan but then project went on like for a long time
like for a really long period of time I mean module tu macam cause very frustrating cause it has nothing to do with our course which is early childhood so nothing to do kan so you learn a lot more to macam business more like
options and like assumptions that why the company go back that kind of is more to that kind of stuff but then like we did our project and all but she never tell us like our final mark yet then life skill is more of like presentations like how you present yourself is more of how to say macam
uh in macam experience through experience cause we do a lot buat macam relationship management lepas tu kita buat the time kita buat like kita punya individual presentation kan it just
we in right this is the frustrating thing ah cikgu just go just go through
cikgu just go through mana part yang kita nak ada buat assignment one dia orang tak ajar like throughout macam in secondary school they ajar everything what even if like those tested only a bit right they go through everything with you but then in like you need to go through it yourself and then sometimes the information and dia orang bagi pun
uh is not correct so you have to search online about that kind of stuff and then you have to remember like cause in early childhood is more of like you have to memorise a lot of things like kenapa budak ini nangis then kenapa ah dia tak eh separate dengan parents jer then uh what kind of symptoms
so macam a bit dry it's very dry
business writing is more to macam you write emails letters
then is easier in a way because ada multiple choice
twenty out of thirty you should get cause teachers said is like a giveaway mark but then yang section yang lain cause you have essay and all that kind of stuff so that's like the
we are like like you said lah this is just semester one it feels like we have been in school for like a long time like we entered like april oh we entered april but like it's it's like we have been in the school for like a year then we still we forgot some if we forget that sometimes like macam how to say
individual task now then you are going to take off our exam then our holiday which is only two weeks we cannot even go tak boleh pergi mana-mana sebab COVID
tak yang mana eh tak boleh keluar sedih and then but then like it's all like we just want to like finish the exam and get it over with cause it's
tak boleh keluar cause mana-mana pergi tak ada duit
so mana nak pergi kalau tak ada duit kan
and then like ni then can think about like other stuff
but they want to tanya you to continue this course like in poly so it's very hard
do like I I I just like to get it over with macam
senang kan kalau kau
aku like I can do bila-bila aku nak I can do any time I want and I'm the type that I want it to be like
macam I'm a I'm a bad person lah I that really really die die I want it to be like perfect like near perfect I want it be like
like cause I there are I've grouped with like there is a lot of like banyak gila is the amount of like group projects right is banyak is like until like every week you tukar group you've just tukar tukar tukar constantly you tukar cause cikgu first of all like
the reason they give is because sebab apa cikgu nak kita meet
work with people they want dia orang nak tengok how
speak english or like other ada apa language from overseas then you will be sent overseas that kind of stuff so they want to see how you are
macam mana kau boleh cope dengan working with other people
kalau aku group yang dengan kawan aku aku sangat frustrated tau
cause I'm the type that okay just get it over with like when you I don't cause I'm also like very noisy aku macam noisy playful naughty but when I do work I just want to do work that I I realise that's my attitude like when I doing work right I just want to like get it done macam complete ah cepat habis cepat kau pergi relax cepat kau pergi like
one corner kau there duduk kau boleh cikgu pun orang bila cikgu bagi time kat kelas untuk buat project kau just duduk jer apa habis tidur
like that kind of stuff but then like almost this semester almost like semua my project kan is die like hujung hujung last minute submit like eh but eh is good work lah we are able to provide good work but it's still
depends banyak dengan who you work with
honestly like there are people that cannot work together ada like yang they are mm
people it matters what my friends like girl friend but I cannot work with them like I cannot work with one guy in my classmates name ima cause he just talk malay cause he macam he's really a perfect
honestly banyak orang cakap is easy in a way it depends they are some courses
banyak yang senang like
senang for you to masuk senang for you to complete senang for you to get a good grade even the teachers admit that if your classmate macam kau yang classmate bo chup like serious like
tak buat kerja kan I mean kau do kerja yang you are given kau boleh dapat A even though gonna work is like so bad
eighteen nineteen seventeen for O level they end up there just because mostly is because of math cause we are very weak in math and then early childhood pun tak ada mana kau perlu ajar math kau ajar one two three four five under ten pun sudah okay dah you are set for life in that career in that sense lah
like because of that guy and people tend to look down so macam
but then macam what they never think is that
really competitive you know like the other type that macam every lesson ada soalan every lesson ada soalan every lesson ada like macam oh
they like the macam
they really think about their ranking a lot lah macam I know that some macam
my friend sawar she hasn't really think about ranking lah but she's clever but rela also clever but she also don't think about ranking macam kita
sorry to say but melayu more relax lah
kita macam more like okay tak apa kalau pass pass kalau fail fail gitu tapi we try hard
tapi macam there are a lot more other races macam they are very keen on
macam competing macam hardcore gila ni semua kan so to me there's no maybe is going at a slower pace than poly because what we are learning is what year ones are learning ah but we are learning it break we break up
more slower in a sense kita boleh more slow but
because I'm used to like I'm the type of person like in secondary school macam aku dah fail fail fail fail fail lepas tu bila kat the end aku macam okay pass macam I made it jelita bah cause I I do set expectation that are high
in it's all about okay every time must be good results and it's like the pressure is mounting up macam
I aku rasa macam very like less freedom cause like continuously like okay everyday I have assignments submit by this submit by that submit by this like even though like I have more assignments than some of my even poly friends like they are more chill they relax actually
senang jer macam gitu then I'm just like oh my god why is this so stressful I was like cause I think that was my mistake
aku go into thinking that macam
senang like ni like it will be nak very easy
but anyway I was inside already like first two weeks first week of school it kill me like okay because no orientation because you straight go into our assignment which drove me like crazy I was like okay I need to find a kid I need to find a kid takkan tell me budak tapi tak nak observe budak tu lepas tu I nak tanya write report pasal budak tu then I'm just like oh my god I cannot do this
but dia orang ingat like macam ni senang cause kau jaga budak jer pe kau jaga budak kau budak tu mak dia tinggalkan budak tu kat kau habis kau jaga jaga but actually
we watch how the budak grow
like how he is doing cause sometimes cikgu yang responsible for like the early childhood of the child the more the responsible is to see if there's a problem with your child developmental wise cause by certain age
like you know we grow up right we grow up knowing nothing then kita okay just besar macam okay lah by this age dah cakap actually there's a
oh I look back my slides right I'm learning ah I'm like tengah revise jer aku macam apa yang aku tengah belajar ni apa kena mengena ni dengan budak-budak and we revise okay that's actually link kita belajar pasal brain then kita faham okay which budak pakai which part of the brain when they are doing this budak pakai then we are just like oh my god we are just learning like
seniors mereka cakap from the first year
kau boleh tahu how hard it's gonna be for the next year
then it's obviously kau dah tahu like you are like
macam it is and there are some poly kids they go into early childhood in poly eh tak tahu apa-apa they don't know anything about budak-budak you don't know anything like
some people even like masuk early childhood they don't even like kids that much cause it's just early childhood is how macam early childhood has
so end up you jadi cikgu atau jadi principal more of that but then
it it is a very stable job cause obviously that job is not gonna that job cannot be taken by robots that kind of stuff so it is a very stable job everybody's gonna like end up like being a teacher so macam that stability is what people want in life kan
dia orang nak duit dia orang nak macam ni but that they don't pay a lot they don't really pay a lot you know in the sense that they do not pay a lot but the stability that
for the next few years kau ada job untuk dapatkan they focus on that then a lot of my classmates they want to go university there are already thinking even up when they start thinking okay aku nak pergi uni from my mind is like okay I know I'm in but do you want to go to uni
I want to I don't know initially memang aku nak baca psychology
that how a child thinks it can further my career in a sense but it's also what I'm interested in but I haven't decide macam belum decide kalau aku nak kerja ke atau aku nak sekolah macam I'll pass macam how to say ah
poly obviously I aku tak nak just stop at like I want to learn more there's a lot more things that I can learn at poly I know that and then
my friend said that in every like I was macam very when dapat pergi kan you are very saddened at the fact that you go cause when your end goal is poly but then my friends said that apa tu once in your lifetime you must experience life
like everybody like is that kind of stuff and you will have a lot of things do but sekarang COVID so kita tak ada buat semua tu tapi we still have like
like just a few week days ago last week we like before our exam like our teacher brought like some snacks and she brought she bawa nintendo switch jer pergi class ah semua orang main just dance is like that kind of thing
all of us want to go poly semua nak pergi poly kita punya ultimate goal is poly
macam bila kau kat first day
dia orang tanya kau like um
then like I think about like ninety percent not hundred percent said they want to go poly and then you see okay ngee ann temasek ngee ann temasek that kind of stuff bah banyak orang cakap dia nak pergi twenty percent want to pursue uni psychology
macam susah tapi that
bila aku tengok semakin aku cakap okay memangnya it's gonna be hard cause there's so much people there's forty people in this room but then like
that's obviously true lah then macam very susah then I see you learn by laju so aku dah macam
oh my god I cannot take this aku macam dah stress I remember ah me thinking that when I do my assignment like oh my god is already so stress aku dah stress gila masa buat assignment aku tak boleh like sometimes kalau kau message aku aku tak reply apa-apa aku just macam
I cannot do this aku tak boleh aku tak boleh aku nak focus like I not everybody when like it's my assignment I just like do my work
how am I supposed to adapt into poly I mean the transition macam I think itu yang susah transitions to secondary and tertiary life cause it's
totally opposite cause in kat ah secondary school all these are the teacher untuk guide kau like okay kau nak buat ni kau nak buat ni okay kau nak submit kan ni kau nak submit kan tu in kalau kau tak nak submit cikgu macam eh kenapa kau tak buat submit
ah kau nak submit tau next time tapi dia dia orang tak remind kau they don't remind you they didn't like teach you everything in that okay ada exam make sure belajar tu jer aku macam what the hell aku macam come on man like
adaptation is how you are ah adapt let me ah I think most people tak nak it's understandable kalau kau tak nak
cause kalau kau dah badly adapt poly right kenapa tu like you kau tak macam you cannot get used to
macam I know ah focus a lot in group work
also I think everyday every thursday is our presentation day every thursday then now change every day like every assignment like macam cikgu ajar one chapter okay by next by tomorrow submit your slides then by this day we gonna present
I cannot I think that's the thing I need sufficient time to study I'm the I'm a very slow learner lah macam you have to admit I'm a very slow learner I'm good at language language macam mother tongue
your english you need to at least get a B somehow because language is very important macam but then now they are making like macam oh mother tongue punya base preschool semua kan but it's still english very important
cause like at one point you realise that a lot of your learning is due to rephrase the words macam there are some things about ah what we learn about like theory psycho analytic theory this kind of stuff is where there's super ego and then like ego that kind of stuff is where we learn how like you know like there's macam kat movie
like macam devil and angel right that's like a real theory and then we learn okay how it affects children
punya like thinking how they make decisions macam mana then macam oh budak ni
like is like macam evil not evil lah
is what you truly desire then how to say super ego is the one that influence you to make good decisions in ego is the one that is making the decisions so these two person are just influencing then macam ah when we realised that it's hard macam susah
serious susah bila aku kat muka sekarang kadang-kadang hujung just tidur I cannot take it aku macam kelas pukul lapan we start at eight and we finish at five and it's back to back classes I don't have a lot of breaks in my class how could I text I don't have a lot of breaks
kita back to back classes
then you get very tired get very tired and you there's more information that can go inside your brain then when you go back home right you macam I think the
macam kau punya record senang kau record like how to say that time aku the whole way aku tidur like it was like two hour class I just sleep the whole way through I off my camera and off my mic then I slept
then there always there's someone in the class that always record and send it to the group so that's a good things so aku tengok balik recording okay macam okay now we have to mix and match that kind of stuff macam keeping balik cause it's very hard to concentrate online class
it's no matter how like late your class is right I just sleeping is like more better like kau tidur jeng kau nak nanti kau bangun kau cakap okay fine
it's just seriously hard oh you know macam now is
now like macam honestly okay at eighteen right ah when I turn eighteen of my birthday I did a video call with my friends
I have a older friend right aqilah kan a year older then dia she tell me macam tegur aku lah
what kind of people you want to mix around with kalau orang mana yang kau mahu dekat dengan
cause biasalah cause in like in religious terms we cannot cut out anybody but still
and eighteen kan kau obviously kawan kau bukan semua ada boyfriends kan sekarang jer kan oh ajak kawan ada they're going out dia orang keluar kat boyfriend dia orang lepas tu dia orang go to the beach even kat COVID COVID ni dia orang text sahaja it's just like ugh I want that I want that but there's no one to have that with but I want that
then like it's how you deal with that situation macam okay kau nak boyfriend tapi kau tak dapat kau nak buat apa are you gonna be like sad but I mean now I I don't know I'm not sad I'm more like okay lah kau tak ada boyfriend
that's why I relax macam okay now I realise you know macam ninety percent of my friends that you macam
my close friend lah macam kau aqilah megan they prioritise studying over anything else they prioritise like how to say like or guys studies
that kind of stuff and then the I realise maybe hada you know she has macam ada boyfriend sekarang kan
takes a lot of decision tau cause kau one year kau nak pergi mana kawan kau semua nak moving along with your life what dia orang tengah kerja dia orang tengah belajar dia orang tengah getting uh upgrading yourself in a way lah then kau nak you won't have a lot of people to spend time with you
betul tak unless you have boyfriend lah but then your boyfriend also studying then what you gonna do
it's different ke so it's college lah so she can work after NAFA but she wants take a break
cause me megan aqil kita plan lagi
ke korea belajar
then we're just like come on hada then she just said kita tak nak
she she doesn't kita tak nak how to say dia nak take a break dia tak nak continue belajar cause I don't think she prioritise
we we are scared to admit but ya we are we we would choose our education over guys kita macam okay kita macam single sedih kan cause sedih tak ada boyfriend
sedih dan lain-lain but
if a guy tells me that my biggest turn off in a guy kan is bila dia bilang aku jer tau dia tak tahu apa nak buat into the future
I don't like aku macam god you need a plan dude you plan your life you need
to get a job you need to like come on like dia nak kena get dia life straight I like I find guys like macam tahu what they are doing in life right very attractive first
susah kalau nak like okay mm we are young so we are supposed to experience a lot of stuff we macam get it lah but then macam we
who you are in life you know macam eh sekarang ni school decision um aku selalu cakap tau oh tapi some people doesn't mean determine who we are who you are oh I'm like
like cause my okay my my parents in a sense they don't really macam put pressure sometimes they do but I kind of understand but top that
and then but the but then macam to me kan the
the aku punya pressure towards myself is lebih besar
so at the end of day kan I'm scared of the disappointing myself you know because macam kau already
macam let's say I aku ada a lot of thing spent untuk diri aku aku ada like a lot of
I actually single best gila sebab kau first of all aku boleh tidur pukul berapa aku nak
like aku boleh tidur pukul sembilan pukul lapan siang
how to say aku tak sangat
aku tak nak lelaki yang macam sticks around all the time
I don't like that I don't like macam macam I have seen a lot of my friends banyak bagi tahu aku apa everyday kau everyday jumpa
macam kau okay kau tak ni macam kau tak rimas kau aku tengok kau aku rimas tau
macam I cannot cause I have I like hanging out with my friends I like hanging out with my friends I like doing things like cause like ah you know I'm crazy right when I watch something I binge watch it like then I can watch like five episode of like criminal minds in one day then I'm like ugh like come on like that crime the passion you know that kind of stuff but then like how to say like
bila kau dah seorang eh
kau ada banyak freedom you know kau you can do a lot of things because now banyak of my friends that break up they are like oh my god
single is fun but after two months they're like oh my god I can't believe you have been single for two years then aku macam aku tak nak kan saya lelaki aku macam ah you know macam my life has been fun all this while
I feel like even if kalau aku dalam relationship kan I would take it very slow
cause obviously aku nak date for long term
apa yang kau nak in life like is it a need or is it a want
I feel I I want a boyfriend but I'm not gonna die if I don't have it cause I'm fine now like aku tak ada boyfriend tau macam
most of last most of my last time my friends ada contact kan can go back with aku akan text macam balik punya eh ya aku balik macam but then when ah I go back home alone
I feel fine apa I feel like okay I'm fine I can sleep bro tak ada tak ada orang cakap dengan aku aku jer tidur jer janganlah aku tidur aku boleh tengok tiktok like the whole way home I'm just watching like tiktok and nobody disturb me
that kind of stuff kalau aku nak pergi aku lapar aku nak pergi makan
then I'm just I just call my friend that okay kau nak you nak makan tak the I the best thing is aku tak payah minta not minta macam aku tak payah macam
like worried keluar dengan kawan lelaki boyfriend aku macam marah eh kenapa keluar dengan lelaki like I can be friends with whoever I want like literally like no doubt you are free but in a sense bila kau dah free for too long
tunggu macam how to say ah
first of all you learn to love yourself back kenapa macam cause girls highly like not just girls even boys sometimes bila dia orang break up eh dia orang kena dump they think that macam somehow ah what's wrong with me berapa muka soalan kau kan tang is like kenapa aku then you have to over that
like time where you like okay aku ni okay actually it's just everyone around me that's shit
kau just macam build up on yourself lah
aku faham ah in a way and then
cause fikir banyak pasal orang sibuk sangat pasal orang tapi tak fikir sendiri sendiri
then bila now I'm thinking like at the end of the day kau seorang jer during this pandemic I spend a lot of time jer I think I spend the most time with you during the pandemic
like bila aku dengar anything I have this habit of like using my phone even when with my family cause aku just nak text all the time then sekarang macam I like brother and my sister they were sick ah what earlier this year so when they go out they always don't want to be ask like
so they always want to have private they want to call girlfriend malam call boyfriend calling ni kau tu
family is important to me macam I think because I grew up
me and my siblings grew up separately so we all came together kan kita macam really emphasise my dad my dad really like
how happy I was when I was with them thing macam
my family is a type macam
kau nak faham like kawan friendship semua
macam is not
anytime boleh end
walaupun kau rapat kadang-kadang eh
kau boleh end kan tapi family kau will always be there with you and you need to understand because kau dah besar you are adult
adult you know macam
aku sekarang I'm eighteen right you don't stop me but I still ask their permission when I want to go out like can I do this can I do that I still ask permission and they still like I don't mind sometimes my mum used to have this family link like macam ah she she like how to say
location ah phone kita like she can switch off she can like switch off our phone
but then like but the way you have to install it cause she recommended my mum have a best friend right she recommend it to her friend but her friend was not happy her friend was like kenapa kau nak lock phone aku macam that kind of vibe you know then bila kita the way my mum install it on our phone right
my mum just macam how to say
my mum just like ah give me touch you punya phone
then kita kena bagi like my siblings just like macam uh tanya like they never ask
aku aku reply aku macam kalau mak aku minta aku phone I aku macam tak tanya aku macam tak ada benda nak hide
I have nothing to hide so aku just bagi
kenapa main kenapa cause he's always playing game
so dia macam very agitated tau so macam
and then macam kita dapat balik kita macam okay and lepas tu she lock our phone like at certain times and when we want to download stuff you have to ask her that was in sec five you know cause it was last year
that wasn't like what tu bukan masa aku muda-muda tau tu last year tau sasha knew about this like apa tu
and then after that she always like lock kita punya phone semua kan then habis tu when family time she lock off kan I was like but we don't ever feel macam
cause like and macam kalau you
that app kan kalau kau pakai more than eight hours kan dia orang lock kau punya phone tu kau tak boleh buka so maximum is eight hours I've never gotten my phone lock cause aku sahaja I spend a lot of time with my family and my friends
I spend tak tau it charge charge semua pasal kita just macam bond banyak-banyak bond
so macam aku I never had that problem
and my sister had more for a few times and then she was okay with it kita tak pernah marah kita macam bila app tak ada kan then we understand now kenapa
naturally now kan kita spend a lot of time together a lot kita tak on the phone kita macam I say to my mum
I have to sleep early today then I don't watch movie like this year during the COVID we watch like the whole harry potter series as a family like every night kita watch the harry potter series as a family macam
uh like at eight after my that eight eh like all on my apa dia off day kita just duduk habis kita tengok harry potter like kami pun tu nangis nangis hujung gila pun macam kau orang mati macam it's that kind of vibe you know then macam but when I spend a lot of time with cousins kan I realise that their families are different
macam they don't really tak kisah sangat pasal family dia orang say
okay aku dah besar pe okay like now what eighteen
kenapa nak spend a lot of time with family
shazlin dia family tak pakai baju raya dia matching tau
dia beli sendiri so pakai different colour ah but my family is like every year like we sit down and we talk about it was like my sister always want pink eh
my brother always want blue then my dad want black but we'll always decide okay satu colour jer
then we buy like same colour and it same with macam makan tau like it's like puasa right we all like put
our suggestion in a bowl then that she picks up every day then she read out then she's like okay today I pick out like we do that every year but we do never complete cause every night ah last day usually last week kan kita banyak makan take out like my dad will bring us all out we had that tradition then bila aku macam spend a lot time macam
with other people and aku realise like I'm lucky in a sense that way cause my family is very close
they dia orang tak macam
dia orang tak macam forbid
but they are like they advise you need to understand they my mum always told me my mum always cakap why do you want to have a boyfriend you are so much more you want accomplish why do you want to be tied down
a lot so macam my mum is like don't want do that then I just talk to them freely like if I have even friends' problem I talk to my mum very freely I talk to my dad then my dad give me advice even education like macam every time I'm moving on to another school or another part of my life I always I always discuss with them I'm I want to do this
I definitely eat rendang
rendang actually that's a good question why tau because
I selalu makan rendang
hari raya but then mak mak
mak always masak like anytime she wants
so when she everytime masak I everytime makan and I love the taste of rendang
so I makan everyday ah
dua bulan makan rendang straight
maybe for my breakfast example then maybe petang makan with roti then malam makan dengan noodle
ya lah ketupat is the best lah definitely
you put serunding oof
actually kari ayam pun boleh makan dengan noodles and like
you had lemak cili api pasta
sedap je lah cakap
sendu lain lah
macam step know it all ah
kirakan the big shot ah
people yang ego
so macam
I just can't stand kalau orang nak macam nak step besar ah nak step orang yang nak step I really just cannot
kirakan dia champion ah kirakan dia champion
more better lebih baik
then hidup tak ada objective
tak ada makna ya because for example if someone
work in terms of because orang dulu dulu mana ada kerja orang dulu dulu
ya so macam
ah so macam buang masa ah hidup
he was searching for things that he wants to do so he was trying so many different industries if his he has like failed banyak banyak industry he dah masuk he fail banyak
and then after the dia dah buat the apprenticeship dengan tattoo artist dia buka kedai dia sendiri
at forty five and kedai dia successful
you rasa you
dah puas with the thing you buat kan
if not sampai bila bila pun kan you tak akan
dapat that this is the life that I want
all that thing yang you dah explore remain inside your body
ya because when I learn a lot of this traditional stuff kan you know I did all traditional stuff
and susah untuk kita nak
that society punya ape tu what do you call it requirement
yeah you go first ah I tak tahu apa nak
because melayu always masak with agak agak
so it's nice when it's agak agak
I want the rendang italian
mana-mana ah
my most memorable meal was your macaroni goreng
your macaroni goreng
and we ate dekat stadium
dekat lantai because we like we just that time I think that was the first few dates that we had kan
like you just cook macaroni goreng for me and then kita duduk dekat
right dekat stadium punya entrance
and then we just sat there and people were like taking bicycle around lari lah apa lah buat exercise lah
we wanted to go kallang wave mall and lepak dekat waterfront punya tempat tu
zaman bila kita pergi ice-skating
I tak ingat lah
I tak ingat
I think so eh no kallang wave mana ada movie
ni hundred need to lookout ya you can see it it's gonna be huge
imagine you get you a hundred lipas ee
yeah yeah kan I cakap
rendang because that's what I deserve
so so you rejected my rendang answer but you gave me kari ayam
apa sia get ignorance
all my punya members lah and even my friends
they say when I masuk dalam bilik
makan oho
if I nak pilih satu eh
you pilih dulu ah I think I know yours
yes please there's another outlet kan
I thought dah buka
somewhere in the west eh or center I tak ingat I know it's not in the east
a'ah seh sedap seh itu
muak because of the cheese dalam dia punya daging
sekarang nak masuk airport leceh ah
buat lawak eh
you doa lah I got car
try kalau pergi changi airport parah baby
because changi airport punya car park kan
so kalau kita gi Shake Shack boleh makan kasi habis five minute okay ah
yours is yellow kan
apa good energy
apa superpower itu
I would say the power to control my kentut without having stomachache
orang nampak me
you know what's a death note kan
which avatar yang botak ke yang biru
oh yang botak eh
tak ada tak ada backup on that statement just because dia budak botak you tak suka
dia macam Ipin with power
badang stuff
ya then then I tak gi mana mana ah
you tak keluar eh
you tak keluar jugak eh
I thought you say you dah catch up already
tomorrow confirm if keluar ramai orang seh
dia makan taugeh macam makan keropok
after she wash right while she's cooking and waiting for the other things to siap right she just take the taugeh and put inside her mouth like is potato chip
rosak eh the lidah

so six thirty dah habis then I balik dengan dia so macam surprise juga apa kan ya so so then macam either that or I still meet them at causeway point ya habis lepas tu end up like we didn't agree on anything ya and then on wednesday she text me yang she ordering food on friday so means dah confirm lah kan ya
I mean not really discuss lah but then like we talked about it but we don't we didn't came to an agreement that okay we shall do this you know that kind macam we just talk then lepas tu but also because it's her house and then we we we know like I think she know I know that like you cannot just come the house that kind because there got one time

buang duit jer
cuma just
kenangan kenangan yang lalu ee I don't know I cringe
true especially this year raya like
uh kita tak dapat pergi jalan raya kan then kita tak dapat jumpa most of them so we really haven't seen them like one year plus gitu
oh I thought worst I was like oh my god no hal
can't ejek seh
to eat it because I really like the biscuit and between like me and my datuk like um
he always like uh cakap like
the biskut is biskut hospital lah dia tanya oh adik nak ke tak biskut hospital ini then I'm like yes please please nak like it's so good like macam like um
I will makan it with Milo or like or like minum teh gitu then I will eat the biskut together
that biskut ada banyak kenangan [lah] with my datuk so I used the biskut as the background of the painting then uh for the forefront of the painting like I put uh my sofa all like from the living room
like tribute gitu
so like I just joined it so I'm trying to start drawing again like I really rindu art lah
it's true it's like I I know a lot of people yang macam
they ada then uh like they
letak like all their energy into the
then their is like wrecked ah but then they are like very bagus in their
word of the day penat
it's very macam
asal kerja merepek seh
tapi sekarang susah lah because uh COVID ya then banyak orang
that masuk that programme jadi to have something to fall back on
legit lah compared to like having tak ada kerja langsung kan
imagine those lagi like
orang is not oh
I don't know macam cool
rasa seh tapi this is like
oh oh I know so you are saving the earth by not eating sayur because you love the earth then the earth need more sayur
my nenek love kambing man
she gonna give any excuse just to eat kambing
she can makan kambing for like
I don't know I think she can eat kambing for like
the whole month straight or something really seh we really have to macam kita kena macam hold dia back untuk
like from eating kambing it's just that bad but she got like high blood pressure all which is like bad ah
you just triggered my like primary school memories like I uh like my my last time school also they they tanam pokok Ribena then they they kasi like me macam
pegang the Ribena punya fruit
it was quite cool like but I don't know how the dia orang buat the fruit to the air gitu
macam like dia orang just
um dia punya buah dia like
like it's not even buah it's dia macam bunga gitu
tapi bunganya dia macam buah gitu eh
oh but tapi dia buat apa competition
oh dah itu jer
tapi cute seh
oh sedihnya
satu minggu jer
but I like the fact that we are like trying slowly now like we can we can also see like macam
singapore cuba try
jadi macam more environment friendly
I don't know dia orang buat like macam ada certain
just rich like dia orang rasa like that sepuluh sen pon macam tak ada apa apa gitu so dia orang macam oh just bayar it gitu
so like they will still bayar it like that ten cent like I think we should like push it up to like fifty cents or something I know fifty cents kan confirm orang macam lagi terasa macam like oh my god that is like duit like I should really bawa my own plastic bag or like bag in general
you know like very like feminine punya bags
apa seh I thought I want to like
kumpul duit from uh
family member ah like kita ramai ramai kumpul duit then like beli something
tapi right some of them already uh like dah beli like dah beli the present
ya then they buy like bag wallet gitu which is something that
I want to buy ah like I don't mind macam we kumpul duit then we buy like macam expensive like Coach or what you know like something a bit more pricey like more quality kan then how ah or maybe I should ask them ah but I haven't like ask them you know
dia orang kena ada bunyi gold kan like
mak cik tak trend ah
she just like gitu jer like it's usually like clothes like very cliche ah like clothes bag like wallet
actually boleh juga ah
boleh ah go jer
I think you know I think I can like kumpul then like buy
uh gelang tangan
because itu hari kan me and my sister we went to Tiffany & Co dekat jurong east
then actually kan dia punya harga pon like tak mahal mana ah like it's still like quite okay I can like kumpul duit ah or maybe like can be just like my immediate family kumpul duit then we just like buy gelang or something I think jewelry is like a good idea
ya boleh juga [ah]
jom kita bercatch up
sekolah kau macam mana ah
jadi seorang jurugambar is aku punya impian actually
tapi if I were to
like menyerah my freedom cause kan being a being a photographer is like a freelancer job
tengah cari ni tapi aku pernah ah satu kali aku um aku photographer cousin aku punya wedding actually
nasi lemak ah
okay ah kalau aku kena makan one dish for the rest of my life
aku rasa aku akan pilih makan pizza
pasal pizza tu filling pastu portion dia macam besar
okay ah not bad boleh makan for the rest of my life tapi the downside is aku punya health akan deteriorate rabak
pastu like the most memorable meal for you leh
oof aku pun nak pergi korea sia
eh hari tu aku baru tengok movie tau keluar dekat pawagam cerita dia pasal time capsule
so macam
aku terpikir ah if right you found a time capsule ah from long ago macam ten years ago gitu what would be inside your time capsule ah
ah ah eh kau dulu art major in secondary school terlupa aku
what to do kena kerja for a living but right terpikir juga aku if manja tak payah kerja lagi for like a living what do you think we will do ah
tak akan depend on just our government kita punya government bankrupt juga
so like macam
kalau macam gitu apa macam susah apa yang kau harap macam free gitu
healthcare tu susah juga ah kalau nak jadi free
education pasal education sekarang walaupun ada subsidy mendaki tu semua kan
mahal juga pastu kita singapore kita punya education kena tinggi baru kita punya job macam bagus bagus kau tengok ah nak jadi doctor education kena overseas university ke susah juga ah
kau kau masuk uni tak
aku punya course ni macam
kena masuk uni ah kalau tak aku takleh tak ada future untuk aku so university ah under medicine gitu tapi susah juga ah pasal very competitive punya situation so if I were to join a local university ah under medicine it will be so competitive with all the kids lor
aku punya impian actually nak jadi photographer ah tapi macam
impian photographer jer macam hobby gitu
so tak nak pursue sangat under photographer pasal freelancer kan so dia punya
hmm so just extra income kalau aku tak ada apa apa ah tapi sekarang aku ni belajar under medicine so
aku punya first and foremost punya important punya course nak masuk in uni will be under medicine ataupun
kau pula kau punya course apa ah
tak ah aku nak cari kerja sekarang pun susah
and then kalau nak try under pharmacy pula dorang punya
you all need macam diploma degree baru boleh dapat the experience
aku tengah cari kerja ah sekarang tapi pasal
times are tough ah so I know for government pun they macam
a bit tough to find job now even though macam
so a bit lah I don't think so I can tahan lor
eh berbual pasal COVID COVID ni semua kan eh aku dengar that time kau kena
satu kat malaysia
the one in singapore was refunded very fast but the one in malaysia tu a bit slow ah
um that's why ah if like you want to study overseas as a melayu I think kan australia will be the most safest because
you know australia they very open and stuff so like ya but then when you overseas you need to stay in a place where ah the place has accommodates to what you are lah like being a muslim so kalau kau nak tinggal kat korea kau kena tinggal kat itaewon situ ah ah cause I heard situ banyak kebanyakan melayu tapi contradict juga situ juga banyak tempat clubbing
so right semenjak kita kat rumah kan confirm kau tengok banyak Netflix kan confirm so macam cerita apa kau tengok kat Netflix
tak aku tengok movie eh
I a bit scaredy cat ah to watch that show but right talking about devil daughter teringat aku pula aku punya favourite show sekarang lucifer I don't know kalau kau tahu ah tapi banyak orang tengah bebual pasal cerita tu so basically dia macam ah detective punya show so they solve crimes and all that tu macam aku punya favourite genre ah ah so basically lucifer tu dia dia actually devil dia syaitan tapi tak ada orang terpikir that he's really the devil until like his face his devil face came out then like um then people started believing it ah cause they are like mere humans kan so dorang macam a bit scared of him but he's a really good detective also ah he work like hand in hand dengan the detective cop chloe it's a great show ah but it's super overrated now

tu pun aku dah lama tak jumpa last aku jumpa pun february yang aku turun sekolah abeh then then hari tu aku nak wish happy teacher's day pun aku lupa

oh yang A-level punya dah quite some time ah dia tak ada dia tak ada banyak masa kan sekarang dengan A-level dia so nak jumpa dia pun susah kau pula
kau punya kawan yang best friend kau dulu kat tampines kan jauh kan
cause kan one of my friends yang A-level dia dia sekolah dekat jer ah not that far so macam to me also can also pick a place to find a day then like we just you know we just compromise a bit lor but cause we not that far right so not too bad ah cause our group of friends then got three of us so
I actually sometimes I want to see some teachers outside of school lah so like if I see them at least I can I got chance mah to say eh how you doing but because I never see them outside ah a bit sian lor then lor cannot catch up with them at all then macam susah ah gitu even during hari raya this year macam like nak gi ah apa rumah cikgu cikgu kan tak boleh pasal COVID kan so tu pun nak catch up pun susah abeh bila catch up pun macam kalau nak catch up kat luar sekolah tak tahu kalau dorang nak ke tak pasal kebanyakan cikgu kita kan lelaki
zoom raya ah it was like um I got two session ah one with my mum side one with my dad side morning we meet my mum side cause hor but our my mum side not a lot of people so it was easy to coordinate just call I three three like three families ah like mine included lor but then my dad side ah eight siblings eh difficult leh then they all very they cannot hear one another
dress up tak dress up ah pakai dress jer pastu dulu punya baju raya ah aku tahu lepas baju raya dengan buat rambut sikit sekejap jer lepas tu

not too bad ah can visit this year for hari raya haji like like five people per family eh five five visitors per household so you eh hari raya haji you got got visit your aunty your cousin I don't know
hmm eh then like hor during the circuit breaker hor what was your most like you cannot tahan one
I cannot tahan ah I think ah I had to celebrate my birthday during circuit breaker like my birthday was right after the circuit breaker um announcement ah so a bit sad ah then like you know uh cannot have the big celebration like last time so I celebrate with my family lor but then I celebrate with my family also cannot do much cannot eat outside mah during that period of time so all order in lor then like a bit special kind of situation lah cause first time mah celebrate at home nobody else so okay ah not too bad hor how about you what is the most difficult part bila kau during circuit breaker
ah I drink bubble tea but like cause I a bit lactose intolerant so I can drink maybe like the small one if not like my stomach a bit upset so aku punya favourite bubble tea is called HEYTEA dia cuma ada kat orchard dengan jurong so tak banyak sangat ah aku quite picky on aku punya bubble tea KOI Gong Cha tu semua okay ah tapi aku lebih suka HEYTEA it's more settling to my stomach kirakan so if I buy bubble tea I will buy kat orchard ah kat situ kalau dekat dekat dengan rumah aku Gong Cha ah tapi tu bila kakak aku belanja tapi aku sekarang dah tak suka bubble tea kau pernah try mister coconut
yang colour pink yang mana satu
oh cause I go with my friend ah then my friend helped to pilih then you know she like a bit like a bubble tea expert ah she keep all the bubble tea chart all in singapore but then like um cause I wasn't that much of a bubble tea fan before so macam aku tak tahu apa aku nak beli abeh dia tolong aku dia tolong aku um pilihkan apa bubble tea like I think I tried the kalau aku tak salah aku tried the not the pink pearl ah I tried the tapioca pearl kot oh tak aku try yang black sesame pearl tu macam tak sedap sangat
aku rasa eh HEYTEA pun macam quite expensive aku rasa depending on apa kau beli ah aku selalu beli brown sugar so HEYTEA is about macam five eighty gitu then kalau kat CHICHA San Chen kau pernah try CHICHA San Chen tak
oh tu dia punya pearl very chewy very um sedap in my opinion tapi dia punya brown sugar nya tu macam macam macam susu ah basically dorang letak susu jer so but then I like their pearl ah not bad not bad sama dengan HEYTEA tapi kan paling mahal kan is uh not too sure eh hmm maybe
maybe maybe KOI aku dah lama tak tak try KOI
aku tak suka pearl dia ah to be honest like I tried the pearl ah it's a bit I mean I cannot I cannot expect lor cause their pearl is not the high end kind of pearl right so uh I just anyhow ah but like I buy also I a bit scared to try the pearl pearl or like the normal bubble tea lor I always try you know last time the one year of secondary school there like the bubble tea is the milo milo blended ah ice blended or something like that ah small like that lor
shiok bro shiok I tell you my favourite drink ah is horlick cause of that I I I cannot stop drinking horlicks ah I tell you is like wah out of the place eh my favourite drink now so like wah thinking about my school food ah oof now ah got halal mala also in one of the food court so not bad ah then their mala also not bad is just that the disappearing chicken the chicken keep every time we buy the big chicken ah suddenly come out ah after they make for us the chicken only left like three four pieces eh then we don't know where it go

wah but then the downside of it right I must always wear my jacket cause it's so damn cold leh like I swear I don't wear jacket right I I I confirm I want like shiver till damn bad I tell you but then after lunch ah somehow ah the aircon a bit leh sekali become hot but maybe because of window open ah then that's why the sunlight a bit strong at that period of time
sometimes ya ah cause like we want the space to study right after school ah cause we need the school wi-fi then lor all those kids there already book table then they make noise then they stay there until quite late ah then they play their game I don't know league of legend or mobile legend lor then they take up the space in um in the library eh then we cannot sit there to study cause they take the space already what they we cannot tell them uh excuse me we need the table mah so just have to tahan lor like wah leh then like the tables we need right then we no choice we just sit on the floor ah sit on the floor also a bit cause no charging port no charging port then laptop die ah ah this kids ah
but I say ah she a bit lazy to go out cause got the safe entry thing then like nowadays also I got nothing to do mah so I sit at home with her then entertain her then now she at home she look at new recipe right then she make it all then all the makanan now right very different it's like post post post COVID like suddenly she add on I don't know what bunch of ingredient ah inside then all the masakan masakan lauk lauk yang dia buat kan semua macam different so macam dia ada add add extra ingredient kau tahu tak
lebih sedap ada ah tu memang ah tu standard tapi different tu different it's all macam ah how to say ah modified ah I guess
hmm oh I like soup ah so like my favourite will always be sup daging ataupun sup ayam but then sup ayam she tak buat sangat ah cause she say like a bit susah so tak tahu but ya
the thing is right she like she cook in the morning ah she cook in the morning I sleep you know then I wake up she finish cooking already even like sometimes she want to make the snacks ah I don't know if you got try before kuih keria wah that one I help her and stuff like pudding and stuff ingredient all I help her buy ah cause that's the least I can do mah then Sheng Siong also a bit a bit pity on her ah to go down buy stuff so I might as well just buy for her lor
dekat tu dekat ah jauh pun jauh cause I in the inside I the most inside the neighbourhood mah so to go out it's a bit troublesome also take like about fifteen minutes like that
walk ah don't want waste money don't want waste money buy ah apa sometimes take bus ah if I lazy want go home like that ah I take bus but other than that I walk ah walk faster
actually tak I go seorang
because  macam takde kawan gitu then  takde orang cam ajak but also  macam I want to like stay at home honestly cause like I really tired from like all the school work  berlambak kat like when you were studying

 pandai pandai that's a smart idea yeah
oh yes like you know like I I was thinking about it I feel like I don't want to  kerja kat office I think that is so  macam stressfull because you have to deal with  orang lain some  orang tak kan  macam suka kau you know and then you have to deal with the boss I mean like you may or may not get a good boss you know you never know then yeah I mean like the working hours
I mean like it's it's tiring lah from what I see like I ask my sister right like how she work like she also have her own office drama  padahal dia tak buat apa apa macam ada orang macam just don't like her lah like especially since she got award she got an award right for being the best a good worker like this ah the person was like jealous of her and all so its like so annoying I don't know I think I want  aku nak jadi boss

bersama conversation partner yang I dah pilih
so err untuk conversation ini yang pertama sekali I have my own sister nama dia rismah okay
so for this recording's conversation partner err rismah akan uh introduce herself you can start now
okay that's very nice okay thank you so much for being a part of today's conversation eh ah terima kasih banyak-banyak and sekarang kita akan err bincang
jadi setiap conversation kita akan berbual pasal satu topic
atau lebih lah kita tergantung uh it depends so untuk topic hari ini kita akan berbual pasal
mango buah mangga any thoughts okay so bila dengar bila first dengar jer uh this word what comes to your mind bila dengar mango jer when you hear mango what comes to your mind the first thing apa jer
I happen to like mango juga so uh bila dengar mango jer kan macam woo sedap ah like
rasa macam wah
macam nak makan jer mango eh macam sekarang ini pun berbual pasal mango jer macam nak makan sahaja so uh first jer kita uh bila dengar mango
actually bila first dengar jer macam rasa
I don't know if you've uh I don't I don't know if any of you dah pernah dengar ke tak but
the brand mango ni memang makcik I memang suka pakai baju mango this T shirt from this brand nama dia mango err by the way ini
tak sponsored lah eh so kita ya faham-faham jer
okay so what comes to mind bila dengar mango kita dah berbual okay so now we are proceeding to the shape of the mango so describe the shape of the mango let's go
okay jadi err buah mango ini kalau kita berbual if we talk about the shape we are
um it's slightly bended it's bengkok sikit ke dalam kalau you tengok betul-betul
something macam apa benda ya shape dia so
mango ini memang interesting memang it's
we can somehow cut it well in a way that kita boleh makan betul tak
mm so kita boleh potong belah dua we can cut it into half and then we can cut it in squares so dia macam kotak-kotak gitu so we can we can eat it like that atau kita boleh
kupas kulit dia and then kita boleh makan
macam gitu jer macam
apa uh we slice it we we can just slice the
and okay shape it's memang irregular tapi dia macam bentuk yang okay lah macam kan macam tak
uh selain daripada besides the shape
about one or two colours so dia ada colour yellow dia ada colour oren
and dia ada juga colour hijau so yang
okay selain hijau there's also there's also red betul tak
okay so err these four types yang paling banyak kita like the ones that we see a lot
usually the the ones that we usually see betul tak so
err yang paling sedap
I honestly tak tahu yang mana yang paling sedap because I've only tried
but honestly mango is my favourite my favourite fruit as well macam memang I don't know it's it's nice so uh the fact that it's both our favourite fruit let's talk about why it's our favourite fruit
mango where can we buy where can we find mangoes nak cari dekat mana eh mango ini
dalam context singapore eh kita boleh cari mango ini
senang nak cari sebenarnya it's very easy to find because
dekat mana mana ada like dekat setiap penjuru singapore mesti ada mango
mana mana mesti ada lah mango
kadang ah sometimes there are like fruit sellers that just
just so that they can sell their their fruits lah gitu jadi dia orang jual buah-buah yang dia orang dah tangkap ke dia orang dah
dapat ke tak tahu dapat dari mana but dia orang jual lah
literally dekat stations and
di dekat singapore ini like we all live err somewhat we we kinda all live near an station betul tak
err besides supermarket pasar mana lagi boleh nak cari mango
err as in it's very easy to find mango lah dekat singapore ini kan pasal it's it's a common fruit
product apa jer yang kita boleh pakai kita boleh cari apa um tak tahu lah
makeup makeup mungkin ada kot eh macam yang rasa mango I I tak tahu tapi so far macam okay let's say kalau macam product kalau betul betul ada mesti ada macam uh shampoo
conditioner yang rasa mango
ah lip balm pun ada
there's a lot okay okay besides like beauty products okay tadi we we were talking about
mungkin kita boleh talk about mango tea
teh teh yang berperisa mango err mango
banyak juga tahu and it's it's err
it has calming effects uh I don't know honestly mango just makes me happy maybe not everybody feels the same towards it tapi err definitely
I bet yang those of you who are listening to this you all already feel like you all definitely want to get mangoes right now betul tak
so err apa lagi eh
dalam segi product kita tadi dah berbual pasal beauty products kita dah berbual pasal
but kita belum sentuh ini
memang dessert paling banyak have you tried any desserts yang ada mango
entah eh when okay when the colour the colour of the mango kan yellow kan
bila the first thing when you see
you will associate it with a lot of good things because the colour is very attractive honestly I think the colour is betul-betul attractive
my attention to it so bila nampak macam colour colour bingsu like she said uh she mentioned earlier bila nampak colour colour bingsu macam
ee nak ah tengok macam the first thing I see is the the
apart from that I feel like dia consistency dia memang
memang cukup eh macam it's not too watery dia chewy dia macam
just nice ah texture dia dekat dalam mulut it's
macam it's it it it seems like she's explaining a little too deep but it's okay
I mean uh we're literally just talking about mangoes for the next one hour maybe we would just you know if we can finish all of the things that we can talk about nanti kita boleh berbual pasal buah-buah lain buah-buahan lain pula kan
okay jadi dari segi product kita dah berbual pasal bingsu sebagai dessert
apa lagi eh
um maybe itu jer kot maybe that's all we have for mango products err I mean
if we're going to talk about benda-benda yang kita tak boleh tak boleh makan there's definitely mango as a brand itu
uh itu macam
yang quite popular and has been around for quite long as well
cuma word mango jer kot I mean nothing interesting about that but
the fact that they could bring it as a brand and could make it something like macam betul-betul macam wah nampak jer macam wah
uh besides that uh kita berbual pasal resepi-resepi mango ada apa-apa resepi tak yang kita tahu
betul betul I feel like ah okay but honestly I think err
ya you can do anything you want dengan mango cause I feel that
entah eh
the it's interesting that mango is the topic untuk hari ini pasal kita actually tak
kita suka makan mango tapi kita tak pernah berbual pasal mango we rarely talk about mango so now that we are talking about it now now we're really really thinking
mango pudding we always have mango pudding dekat mana mana pun mesti nak cari mango pudding especially dekat wedding
like at your friend's house mesti ada err
because kita tak pernah I mean jarang lah ya berbual pasal mango that's what I find it interesting kalau kita berbual untuk our first recording kita berbual pasal mango pasal
entah I feel like none of us actually think have you ever think
tak pernah ada kan
I really wish ada mango soda
um that's that's right that's actually quite smart maybe you should try that next time kot
uh do you know that uh in some parts of the world dekat luar negeri some parts of the world dekat tempat lain
the fact that dekat southeast asia dekat asia tenggara kita actually the king of fruits ini
so besides that uh okay the the scientific name eh untuk ini ini buah is actually mangifera indica
okay it's a drupe or stone fruit itu macam semacam buah itu the type dia nama dia stone fruit
kan uh ada berry ada apa apa semua then this one is just stone fruit which is cool because memang if you look at it
okay so it means ah okay what stone fruit means is actually the the seed is large so dia punya biji err biji buah dia itu memang besar
okay and mango itu actually juga native dekat india
dekat india itu
uh southeast asia asia tenggara that's why that's why we said that it's really really easy to find mangoes here because
how interesting is that macam
lama gila seh like what the hell
now we're born okay at this point of time I have no idea what I'm talking about but kita go on jer eh
size dengan colour dia juga tapi dia uh lain-lain
an impressive nutrition profile ini betul betul
err mango ini memang penuh dengan khasiat there's like so much nutrition value value
means that err selain kita besides kita besides
and then apa lagi eh
okay in this website yang I dah cari ini dia kata err in fact studies link
err digestive health and eyesight dan juga has a lower risk of certain cancers
okay nak tahu tak uh nutritional value dia
okay so calories sembilan puluh sembilan
one point four grams gitu lah
carbs err twenty four point seven grams habis dia punya lemak dia is zero point six grams
lagi eh okay dietary fiber two point six grams
copper wah banyak eh dia punya nutritional dia copper err twenty percent of the folate eighteen percent of the
apa itu tak pernah dengar but sure seven percent of the potassium six percent of the riboflavin
thiamine four percent of the dengan magnesium four percent of the
okay err dia dia bilang dekat sini it also contains small amounts of phosphorus panthothenic acid
selain daripada itu mango pun is very high in antioxidants okay
okay enough in the nutritional facts we are left with three minutes to talk about mango and maybe the next thirty minutes kita boleh berbual-bual pasal buah-buah buah-buah lain lah pula eh
okay experiences dengan buah mango eh
I don't know every experience I had with buah mango is quite interesting because
I always have mango bingsu dengan kawan-kawan ke dengan siapa-siapa betul tak what about you do you have any uh interesting experiences dengan buah mango
um betul I think she's right
memang I think buah mango ini senang busuk eh and dia masak cepat so
ya just just bila dah beli itu when you
uh as uh your fridge ke tapi it doesn't have to be in the fridge also lah I mean orang tiap-tiap orang it depends right oh and err talking about experience dengan mango I feel that I like to cut up mangoes macam potong-potong mango habis taruh dekat dalam freezer
woo dah keluar macam
semi frozen macam entah sedap macam ice you know
betul that's I agree strongly dengan uh whatever that she said and also oh my god I can't believe I forgot about this
exactly itu pasal okay like okay let's just talk about it I suka mango ice cream yang dia dekat yang ada macam popsicle itu
oh my god bila you take one bite dia macam
wah panas-panas makan itu sedap seh macam seriously like that's the best
betul I don't know
cara you explain macam a bit weird tapi tak apa lah eh I I think we get it so whoever that's going to vet this audio please I apologize kalau topic dia macam lame sangat but we'll try to get better topics in the future definitely
take a break from mango topic because uh whoever that is going to listen this for one hour mesti boring gila dengar kita berbual pasal mango betul tak so let's hear about your day what have you done today
question dia tadi satu question eh tapi dah melalut eh tak apa it's okay
okay this week actually is my first week err since err holiday that school resumes so err as per usual I had my class today tapi because you know kan sekarang tengah pandemic tengah
tengah you know like the the virus is you know masih dekat singapore masih ada cases lah kan so today we had
it's really it it's it's really sad because I see I pun dah melalut tak apa it's okay
okay back to the topic err seriously I think quite sad because dah berapa bulan seh dekat rumah like
I was hoping that we could go back to school because I really am productive dekat dekat sekolah like my brain my work like ah I can just think and do work
much more than I can do work at home macam macam mana eh macam susah lah buat kerja dekat rumah cause you know you have your bed you have your
your I don't know food there's a lot of food so you get distracted easily dekat rumah so your productivity level is not as
maybe not maybe some of you all feel that dekat rumah lagi err productive lah but today is uh
nothing too extreme nothing to some macam okay okay jer lah I still managed to get some of my personal time today so that's nice
okay what do you think are you the type of person who would do work or who is more productive dekat rumah ke or is more productive dekat luar
betul exactly
I had sambal fish and sambal egg
then err ada this apa nama dia macam soup petola gitu
dengan bihun bihun eh ke suun
I think it's suun this dia macam bihun but it's like um
I don't know it's similar to glass noodles yang dari japan so I think that's what it is then apa lagi eh um ya that's what I had today and I had a sip of tea
today um because you know uh work's getting really really stressful jadi macam you know we just had have a sip of cammomile tea then err lepak lepak dah itu jer
okay if it's up to me I would like to talk about apa eh apa yang best eh nak berbual okay let's talk about our favorite music
um kalau kita berbual pasal
artist okay kita berbual pasal genre first okay we'll talk about genre my favourite genre is very err much the same as hers um it's very wide I don't have a specific genre
is in a genre that is not my favourite genre do you get what I mean macam
my favourite song is this symphonic song called canon in D I think you all know this song lah macam okay that song is my favourite song
just gives me it just brings out a lot of my emotions that I rarely have jadi macam bila dengar jer macam oh my god my emotions semua keluar but like
let's talk about the next genre my next genre yang favourite itu let's see I think for now I don't have it's a tie between err western songs dengan
however macam similar dia itu macam sama tapi lain lah you you you get what I mean
dia punya upbeat dia punya instrumental semua sama tapi it's just that the language probably different kot macam that's the distinct difference
okay and then um my favorite song from western and let's see I think it's paling banyak lagu-lagu western dekat kot that is the one that's very popular
I I would say lagu um
uh dah lupa tajuk dia
ah I tak tahu kalau banyak orang dengar lagu ini but
it's called mevoy M E V O Y daripada eh the one that is that sang the song is julieta venegas
that song is very nice dia
apa lagi eh ah oh ya so that song in from spain I don't know if he she's from spain I main asal asal jer
sebarang ah apa lagi eh okay from korea I guess I would say my favourite song is
entah banyak man I have a lot of groups that I like
then err okay I also because err this is my family is an um indonesian family so kita dengar banyak lagu lagu daripada indonesia juga lah so err
we would say it as pulau jawa
that's where we come from and then lagu-lagu from there is semua
variety juga eh macam they have err songs yang macam western western gitu dia orang pun ada songs macam ballad
dia ada genre genre ah koplo oh my god koplo my favourite genre
it's dia macam traditional gitu tapi dia campur-campur dengan lagu-lagu lagu-lagu barat
lagi eh ya so that's my favorite music okay kalau let's say your favourite food apa what's your favourite food
I mean I'm I'm feeling it right now cause ya I mean tak boleh tak boleh avoid lah pasal kita berbual pasal makan kan so automatically as human beings kan kita first thing berbual pasal makan jer mesti fikir pasal makan betul tak
betul exactly but eh tadi you berbual pasal tenderfresh kan I tak pernah seh pergi tenderfresh is it
is it murah ke mahal ke
it's okay I mean err okay kalau macam okay err for me kan kalau makanan favourite I is
I categorize my favourite food dalam dua
categories tahu macam satu I like err
satu is comfort food dengan lagi satu is food
I okay comfort food ini kan is the the the category for comfort food ini kan is the type of food that I can eat
everyday tak jelak-jelak like
tak bosan bosan every time every time I can just I can eat that everyday literally tapi kalau macam let's say kita berbual pasal err the food that really like macam
okay so my first one my comfort food eh is bakso mi bakso I don't know if you guys know that
mungkin dekat singapore ada singapore definitely ada
tapi kalau dekat malaysia I'm not so sure dekat brunei pun I tak tahu sangat
but definitely dekat indonesia dekat singapore ada confirm
so that's my comfort food err mi bakso
I would have a lot of sambal to go with it and I also have ah pansit goreng
pangsit goreng in um english is basically just a fried wanton lah kan
I know it's like a little bit like whoa apa sia
but that's like really macam once in a while gila like when I have money that I'll get that
kalau tak no usually my friends would be the one that would bring me there treat me
I feel bad but you know it's a it's a good treat I mean kalau macam birthday jer kan macam confirm
confirm dia orang plan dekat situ situ juga pasal they know that I love the K
okay so now we talk about favorite food apa lagi eh

I juga boleh eh I pun boleh berbual bahasa melayu lah macam normal cause we're singaporeans kan I'm born here

first day  pergi sekolah physically
people who work as influencers selalu macam gitu like think about it singaporean pun banyak influencer pe yang like they don't really do much like you know all the pretty chinese girls on Instagram
fast paced I guess I used to play a lot of I started with um apa tu
uh I started with BlackShot then like I used to play my with friends in the computer lab when the teacher wasn't looking then we started playing BlackShot together then from then I started playing two like I got tell you before right I started playing two with my uh primary school guy friends cause we used to walk back from together then you know sama-sama right then when you get back home also we together we play like two together lah then we didn't study much but that's besides the point then uh I remember one time like he was teaching me how to
I stopped playing for a while oh no I also played Halo two at my friend's house a lot ya that was like cause you know I got primary school punya clique kan then kita used to go to his house like my friend's name is hadziq then we used to go to his house during the holidays then we would go there and we would play Halo two then how it works is that you know the screen then on top got the like player one then below got player two so it was a split screen then dah kecil kan then my like you can see the difference between people's proficiencies side by side then like I was running around trying to find my friend right cause I wanna shoot her then she was she was walking then she stop then she had to turn the other controller eh the other what do you call it joystick ya she had to turn the other joystick and then she walked then she stopped then she turned the joystick so she cause she couldn't like like like coordinate her hands or something so ya I ended up beating her a lot so
like he really he really suka macam game game lah macam gitu then he will always buy stuff like new games or like he'll put like emulators uh into his computer and stuff then you just attach the
better like it's pretty good ah I don't know if it's still that good now I guess it's just I got used to it you know dah biasa
the ratio was really off it was like twenty girls ten guys or I think nineteen girls eleven boys something like that ya it's pretty bad then they will always play together then I also was interested lah then one time they ajak me then like like we started playing together then that's why they taught me how to play PUBG
but I felt kind of bad lah I was quite a team burden back then but that's just because uh I wasn't used to the game I think but it was really fun apa tu uh selalunya selepas exam or selepas sekolah then kita just you know there's like convenience stores usually right ya then we would go there then kita makan sama-sama then after we finish like eating then we just play PUBG together lor it was nice it was like one of my favourite memories from ya ya it was damn ah it was really nice lah I like thinking about it
combination of a lot of their own consoles they just kind of improved on the design sikit-sikit
four four four or three it was I was super young then I went to uh my makcik's house siapa eh
ya so I think I stopped playing that I was thinking of getting Smash also though like I don't know I didn't know if it would translate well onto the Switch Lite or not cause I know a lot of people would prefer to play it like on the screen then some more like kalau
your friends come over or something then you know you would want to play on the big screen together I guess so that's why I didn't get Smash ya I got Mario Odyssey instead ya and then I ordered uh Stardew Valley the one that's macam uh Harvest Moon ya but I ordered it like what two weeks ago or a week ago then the store hasn't contacted me I need to them on Facebook I think
tak ah aku beli kat uh you know
ya then dia orang ada website pe so I just searched up the game there then aku cari cari cari and I think kena like they have to ship it out from somewhere else then like aku faham ah like it takes awhile to ship stuff over to singapore but like two weeks is a bit of a long time then they never contact me then they said like I went onto the website yesterday in class then I was like uh searching if they had like any issues with the shipping cause of COVID right then uh apparently if the store doesn't contact I need to contact them either on Facebook lor I need to email then I don't know do you think it's better if I email or if I on Facebook
if I send an email also maybe tak baca that's the thing right I ordered a day six album like in
days gone by punya era like the retro punya ah
aku order march kan then sekarang dah
like dah nak dekat november
ya but I don't think they meant to scam me lah I think they just genuinely forgot about it then uh I need to get a refund probably but I've already waiting so long then macam paiseh sikit to you know
maybe cause they have more people so it's more spread out I guess then maybe that's why they got more time to enjoy enjoy sikit
january like even before my birthday seh then ya it's it's so early I mean it's good lah maknanya like they get to
abeh kalau bukan april what's the on after that
I think I think I understand what the commando thing is because set lin's brother was like commando in ya in it's kind of ironic because they're not singaporean but you know as in like they weren't born in singapore ya ya they're burmese oh ya ya ya ya ya that's why his name is so weird set lin ya then um they became singaporean like they got singaporean citizenship then his brother was commando then uh if I'm not wrong right they are the ones who are most likely to risk their life when it comes when it's like going to be war lah like they're the ones doing the more dangerous stuff so that's why like when people do that's what that's that's usually what they think about lor it's like do I really want to risk my life for this certain role it's a good role like there's a lot of honour that comes with it but also like a lot of thought lah like what if singapore actually does goes go to war then you know macam sedih lah to see to have your mother worry about you you know while they're back home ya then I remember at HeadRock
malaysia tak tahu honestly tak ada ah thailand thailand dia orang macam draw lots sia I think I remember cause apa itu bam bam went to thailand back to thailand then he was or was it ten they were like sitting together then they were like waiting for it to happen then they just draw draw draw draw the lots then after that end up both of them don't need to go
when it happened it felt macam hunger games seh honestly like why don't you just drawing why why do you gather everyone there to draw lots like just do it like I don't know in an office then hantar letter kirakan like so
so pelik to have everyone there macam
oh yang uh grave of the fireflies
itu sedih gila sia no it's because macam it's
my uh apa itu arwah nyai uh she came from indonesia then dia naik
aku ingat dulu kan it was like a big ship like a big ship then she just hopped on and then she rode to singapore but no she naik sampan sampan kecil dari indonesia jawa like she took that sampan all the way to singapore with like I don't know one like a few of my aunts and uncles my mum wasn't born yet my mum was born in singapore then she came all the way to singapore ya then like my arwah datuk was a security guard or something ya
she told me during the war like they the japanese would always like seek out very pretty girls ya so like she knew like her neighbours they would purposely macam apa eh uh mud ya they would take mud and then they would just rub it on their faces trying to make themselves look very very dirty cause they don't want to look like appear attractive to any of the japanese soldiers lah then that was quite scary then had to ration out food also that was the worst then you know my mother she used to I don't know lah like like they were really it was really really like they were really poor
then makan apa-apa jer lah cari dapat daun ke apa then ambil jer lah makan jer
ya then she but they always tried to have lauk lah like uh even back then you know
in canteens or something people selalu makan nasi taruk kicap kan but
like even back then I don't know why ah but that family of theirs they never did that they at least have like one kuah to eat together ya cause I think
even though they were poor my arwah nyai didn't want them to feel poor you know like at least have something lah had something there to eat together then ration out lor as much as possible ya
serious it was it was a sampan kecil aku I swear I ingat I thought it was like gonna be a really big ship then I talked to my sister about it then she said you realise it was a sampan right like it wasn't a big ship then I was like huh how she fit inside the sampan then she said oh like the same way everyone else does ah you just squeeze together then just hope for the best ah then can you imagine how many days that would take from freaking indonesia all the way to singapore on a sampan with other people some more
then ya then she came to singapore I mean either way they would have gone they would have gone to indonesia anyway ya but it's okay lah if my arwah nyai didn't come to singapore in that sampan I would still be
jawa so
but my mum a bit merepek seh like you know that time japan kena tsunami and like earthquake it was pretty bad right the
uh apa eh
macam tak kena ah ah
mm okay ah four hundred thousand but but still fifteen thousand out of that much is still quite a lot right then um there were a lot of people saying that they saw a lot of the spirits of the people who died ya but weren't like harmful lah they were more of like they were very lost like a lot of them said that like the hantu-hantu ini semua dia orang
I may have watched a malay drama about it like this girl was a victim and then she moved like she became like I don't know ah she had foster parents or something then she grew up with them then you kahwin orang kaya or something I don't know but anyway cause of that I learnt more about the like the thing that happened ya it was really bad like it devastated
you know cause of the water and then like kasihan lah cause
I think belum eh
ya uh for I read somewhere I think on reddit uh ada orang kata bila dia tinggal kat zone
under had more amenities or something ya or it was decorated nicer lah but at the same time it's also because has a lot of financial backing cause since they're the super majority so it's kind of like a grey area of like maybe they do want to do a lot more but they just don't have the means you know then it's kind of like I don't have the means to show you but I can show you I can't and at the same time you know mm politics macam confusing ya
I don't know why she went to when she could have gone overseas though I guess why she just wants to be back here since she was overseas for a while ya but her friends from her international school ada yang pergi uh mana
ya international school lah so they're kaya gila lagipun we were supposed to go overseas
tiga kali seh supposed to go overseas bangkok tak jadi then malaysia tak jadi then japan pun tak jadi
I think yang paling heart pain was that we couldn't see the tokyo olympics cause we were supposed to if we could have gone this year then like okay lah memang kita boleh pergi japan any other year but the problem is that we can't always go when the olympics are happening you know and then dah lah like how do we how do you even get tickets to go to the olympics
aku pun I mean like I was willing to settle for kita just stay in malaysia overnight seh or like for a few nights then to pun tak boleh literally a week before we went lucky I asked if we could get a refund or not just in case
sedih gila it wasn't even just border tutup seh border tutup then circuit breaker fuh terus my my mood just plummeted
then next year internship dengan mampus
last movie I watched I think I think aku tengok dengan anwar dengan irna

yeah itu pasal ah nak buat apa right it's so sad seh like the amount of opportunities that we missed this year
kita tak tahu seh whether next year you can go or not
same oh my god last time I always go to makan sushi and the paling best right is like when malam malam kita go driving then we go and eat Ramly burger
but his burgers sedap gila oh my god actually like the authentic malaysian experience and I love it but like now
kasihan seh like
habis sekarang sebab COVID then they cannot do all these businesses you know like how they used to do and it's like so sad
huh tak best seh
dress up as a pocong to scare them
actually that's quite kelakar sia like honestly can you imagine malam malam tengah drive
habis tiba tiba nampak pocong scary wei I also will turn around seh LOL
yeah honestly but when in singapore tak ada apa apa jadi punya
like it's like okay kalau keluar terus kena ah arrested
habis like dia orang semua like they have fun with it ah but like I think I'm still grateful to be in singapore
no I don't need to go like all my lessons are all online and like seriously it's so fustrating I'm so penat
so it's like you always think that you have assignments due when actually you don't then like stress gila tahu honestly
it's like you would think that kalau belajar online lagi senang kan but no that's really not the truth it's really harder but the thing I'm grateful is like there isn't as many exams
but luckily for me tak it's like
our exam dulu kat um like hall besar besar kan sekarang it's all just in class
then honestly to me like tak ada vibes ah like there's no
and like honestly susah gila nak focus because like
ah tak my exam is all written
next sem we're going to have macam coding classes but this sem so far tak ada ah most of it is just like theory memorizing all so it's all on paper
eh but I thought they extended tak eh
best apa honestly I hated like
so it's always I feel like macam I'm the only person yang cannot focus at home but honestly I really can't you know but all my friends say like
oh it's so fun because no one disturb you or force you to do homework that kind of thing like it's very free and easy for them but like I tak rasa honestly
like for me like susah gila lah to focus at home like to juggle between like your life
ada satu tempat untuk belajar satu tempat untuk like stay home and relax you know then now is like very different
oh typical like mak melayu right honestly like they are all so naggy I think it's like
they are just born with it and I'm scared that bila kita jadi mak kita pun sama honestly I don't know
and I started using like photoshop of my laptop to like tulis notes and stuff
I did learn like a bit from this COVID nineteen situation bukan lah banyak sangat but
oh I only makan there like once before then I got try macam their chicken it's ironic cause I don't like chicken
but like their chicken is one the best but honestly I think a lot of people say that that's their best menu item right like the rendang
oh who did you makan ah malayan council with
oh man low key nak makan seh
like honestly but like you said mahal gila like I still remember the
memang normal lah cafes in singapore all the food mahal kan tapi like
yeah I always sesat at arab street honestly like
I can follow Google maps but I'm like honestly so bad at following directions so I always always sesat
more often so now I think I won't get sesat as much hopefully
I've been thinking of all these nice food to makan but guess what I can't makan cause I'm broke I can't find a job
same susah gila nak cari kerja serious like super fed up you know I'm like so fustrated
that kind of thing so like obviously semua orang apply apa kan
then bila apply then dia orang tak get back then macam tak faham seh like
I don't even know if I want to kerja at this kind of places cause honestly stress gila
like nanti ramai gila customers habis nanti got like fussy fussy people all but hopefully like
like dia orang macam sengaja right like they never like properly advertise their job scope
then only when you contact them then they will be like oh you have to do this nak kena buat itu lah nak kena buat ini lah
and I just don't understand like I've seen so many job postings like I also have that Telegram thing like apa satu
then like all ten never get back to me like serious tak faham seh
I don't know just make it easier for people to apply especially now macam COVID nineteen
time you think like senang meh cari kerja
yeah like honestly the tunggu like untuk tunggu like for them to get back to you that's like the worst part lah honestly
then like fikir fikir about it right it's like
you say a week right then any time in between that week pun you can call me you can like text me tell me I got the job
will end in a few months tapi tak
hais all this money that went to online shopping and now like yeah we can keluar but like barely pun
like I buy it for what I can't even like pakai to keluar and it's like so heart breaking
have this kind of spike and all then like when it terjadi macam terperanjat you know
we were like oh it's china's problem like kita semua ingat like oh china jer apa yang ada virus ni
like honestly I think in our heads we all thought that it would be like SARS because SARS was very contained in asia tapi tak seh
like tiba tiba ada berapa banyak cases
sekarang [dah] like how many one million two million kind of cases
like honestly banyak gila and if you look at the I'm so glad I don't live there because they are so like
and honestly like dia serious tak guna ah honestly he doesn't even do much for his country
and it's like now I see all these TikTok videos of like people who don't want to wear masks and like tak faham seh like
I understand wearing mask is susah lah but like you have to do it for the sake of your safety and other people also what right
yeah but if you think about it macam kasihan seh orang orang kat because like in the end
if you think about it all these old people who like they don't know much about the virus cause it's something like baru to them right
then maybe they will just dengar what he say because in the end he's president what he is the person who does everything and has the right of way
so it's like so kasihan
yeah exactly something that the president don't have and it's like so merepek sia you think about it it's like
it's like now I'm kind of having holidays because my exam only like on thursday lepas tu habis kan
ah kejap eh
so he like macam like got my attention ah then like wah he not bad sia honestly
but tak apa ah maybe this kind guy will be the exception kan
tuk tuk and like nenek will have these kind of names
super super tinggi but like one seven five not bad right
like okay lah I'm not like super upset about it ah tapi um macam sakit hati ah like because like
he just double tick me sedih tahu
I only made the account semalam so it's like what
banyak gila like malay guys who like match with me
daughters as in macam anak anak perempuan
it's like very personalized so macam you tahu macam he don't use it on other girls
I don't know the guy so far okay lah I think everyone macam
extra bosan now cause of like COVID nineteen
intense apa
like tak pernah dengar seh a dating app like this like OkCupid is so chill what it's like
habis lepas tu start talking but like Bumble is so intense what the heck
you got try before right the K Fry chicken sedap tak
ah seh honestly kita selalu pergi malaysia because like the prices are cheaper right especially with the
it's sedap gila like I don't even like dim sum
yeah like dulu kita kan selalu pergi malaysia like my family will go to like
makan like we are always eating you know
like you said there's not much to do in so it's always like makan makan makan
like kita
in one day I think we will makan at like what three different restaurants and three different places
like konon konon macam food tester ah try out like all the food in malaysia and
but like honestly like best gila seh that experience it's like
like you say everything that is not halal in singapore is halal in like malaysia
so it makes my life so much easier like you know every time I go like kena makan pepper lunch
I think it's like I saw your story then you saw my story kita dua kat kan then you like ask me where I going then like you said oh I going there also then I remember it was so funny
habis like tengok bawah
eh is that anna habis my whole family macam
siapa ah dia boleh like terserempak in cause we are singaporeans right
best apa imagine being able to go to an Apple store and like just woo spend all your money on the stuff honestly good life
I rindu seh like I used to love going weddings you know why
cause I want to makan nasi biryani
but yeah basically macam
so our weddings we'll make sure that we eat nasi biryani then we will make sure that it's the most
authentic nasi biryani cause you know sometimes people try to like put a twist on nasi briyani and all tapi tak
our weddings will always have like the nicest nasi biryani and honestly I just miss all that
he always does macam poll on Instagram and then got one time he tanya which is a must have for your wedding
then people didn't vote nasi biryani I was so sad you know I felt like it was a betrayer because
every wedding has to have nasi briyani like
when I think of wedding I think of nasi biryani right
yeah and another thing that I feel like kena ada is sambal goreng pengantin right
mm macam macam pelik also pe like hari raya is a holiday by itself you should enjoy it totally pe like why would you want your wedding in the middle
you know apparently got some people who purposely do their wedding during puasa so tak payah makan
but like how pelik is that like puasa is like meant for
puasa you know macam
mana orang nak pergi wedding mana orang nak pergi celebrate semua macam merepek kan honestly
exactly it's just weird honestly now thinking about it sekarang COVID
err wedding kena ada apa apa dua puluh orang jer kan
you know like honestly you know how malay families macam selalu kena ada wedding besar besar kan honestly I wouldn't mind
like I've always been telling myself I don't want a wedding yang besar besar because
okay you think about it you eh you're the pengantin right then like penat gila seh you must tukar outfit berapa banyak kali throughout the day
habis you kena salam salam semua orang kena senyum the whole day I don't want
macam my wedding to be full people yang my mum tahu you know cause it's my wedding pe shouldn't it be people yang I tahu not my mum
yeah I think yang paling penting is like the wedding it's like you do for yourself
yeah you did for yourself but then everyone remembers you as like the bride yang cantik yang berseri you know that kind of thing yeah honestly
yeah it's like a half half thing lah need to see whether my husband in the future kaya tak kidding
you know macam like err ada movie this one movie I forgot what the title is ah tapi macam
dia orang best friends dari kecil then they came up with their own book on how they want their wedding to look
habis like they in the end they ended up fighting then they weren't friends anymore
like honestly I forgot the name of the movie ah tapi the movie best gila
since dulu I've always wanted to do like a
I don't think being special is important but I think like just being unique not normal macam lagi best ah to me
I haven't thought of children's names yet but I'm pretty sure like that phase will happen soon cause I'm like so bosan now
yeah like in singapore macam susah gila nak like get all these things ah honestly cause
susah eh nak dapat all of it yeah so it's like
yeah I also think about it like err my dream die do right is to belajar in Australia
but actually like if you fikir about it lah actually it's better if you get into a like local uni because technically they are better
but I just feel like the experiences you gain bila like you go overseas and all is just very different you know
then like I don't know I also pun nak migrate but then if you think macam sayang right cause everyone is here then nanti raya macam mana raya will be
but I can't imagine now like sekarang jer [dah] susah for me to speak malay then imagine like when I have a child in the future
like you know dulu all my family members call me celup because they say like I always speak english even though I should be speaking malay that kind of thing
then when I got into higher malay in secondary school semua orang terperanjat macam huh
how did you even get into higher malay when you malay like berterabur
yeah actually it's true ah macam
we're not so good at malay right but we're not that kind yang want to totally forget about our language
like dulu like in malay class my cikgu always say like you want melayu to become obsolete is it
how all of you tak tahu cakap melayu semua then like I think about it like true seh like
how can a language just disappear macam sedih kan like you grew up with it and then like suddenly one day you see nobody speaking malay
so I will try my best to improve my malay sekarang I don't know
yeah honestly faham ah like hari raya is very like
kau tahu macam mana nak buat brownies

ha nampak
topic ni berat eh topic ni is very this topic is orang kata very wide dia punya spectrum is very wide that means we can talk about a lot of stuff doesn't need to be just beauty in terms of appearance tapi beauty in terms of everything not just
uh look wise tapi beauty in uh nature beauty in personality beauty in
there's a lot this topic is memang kita boleh counter bad or good we can counter about this so it's a really good topic I would say for the first
uh time kita berbual
so okay kita start gini lah eh kita start with the first one is
what is the definition of beauty to you okay kau kau start dulu apa kau punya definition of beauty pada kau
oh that would tu bagus tu yes that that is bagus err bagus bagus
I don't see myself as kau tahu kan macam victoria's secret punya type punya ke lawa memang tak lah memang not even near that lah but because I I have my insecurities um based on appearance juga which itu pun is another topic eh kau kau pun tahu kita kau pun tahu about me about
which people in our society is blinded by that sebab
standard kalau kau lawa orang pandang kau people will look at you and then they say but that doesn't mean that your personality is good that doesn't mean that your attitude is good so that is what
tapi for me beauty kalau kau lawa pun mana pun but if your if your attitude is macam gitu then
then memang you know what I mean
memang tak boleh tak boleh dianggapkan as beauty overall and it it this is our perspective ramai orang ada different punya perspective but we're we're not gonna touch on that but we can just uh it's between the both of us what is our definition
oh okay for me my kawan the friends that I go like the friends that I cari atau dapat it's okay we we can talk about poly ya kita punya poly days is kita tak I I don't see like oh kau lawa I'm gonna be friends with you no no no no I never sebab
kau lawa I was going to say you no no no no I never sebab
I mean I don't know for me memang I don't see
go towards that sebab it's not gonna be a genuine punya relationship you know
sebab it's just gonna be
for clout macam you know you know some people uh there there is some uh cliques ke apa whatever in school yang macam okay sebab kau lawa kau popular I'm gonna to go to you because
I'm gonna get that that that popularity I'm gonna get that that fame dia ada attention so I think is there a generation that can is there a genuine relationship that can that can last you know
which is memang maybe not because during after kalau your your school is is done then that's it will you ever meet the person yang macam will you know the how deep the relationship goes how deep the friendship goes
macam for me and you eh macam this is kita pun semalam baru jumpa eh we just met yesterday with our with our friends and that is like kita punya relationship first first kita start from sec one
and until now it last ramai of my other friends macam kita dah macam you know after that macam dah start to putik putus but with you and err err our friends yesterday it is a long lasting macam kita tak awkward tau and that that is something that I see down the road we are still gonna be friends forever inshaallah
you know we are all beautifully in our own ways but what I what I see in friendship is that the how we treat each other you know kita punya chemistry kita punya behaviour
kita punya personality because okay imagine kalau the reason why we are both still friends is because our personality towards each other is that we care we are genuine kita takde macam makan orang makan orang you know what I mean like like betray or
tak payah cari beauty for clout or fame because it won't bring you any betul tak tu
like fashion wise you know is it oh damn okay I think I get what you mean my my course pun ada juga yang those type of cliques that
uh handsome uh lelaki kat dalam my course yang baik yang humble yang tahu yang dia orang tak stuck up but there are also cannot deny that that there are also um
uh girls that they they dia orang punya dia orang macam you know they have that that beauty standard lah dia orang ada that
fashion wise in terms of beauty wise and and they are not they are sombong they are arrogant you know
so so macam it's a
I don't know err macam for me that's not the right I mean okay but it's hard you know cause you know you know they say kalau kau lawa you should then uh take advantage of it like you know you should your personality pun kena bagus
sebab but but people people who are lawa usually you know you know dia orang dia orang I'm not going to say all but
most of them gonna ada that ego you know that ego that that it depends lah how you are brought up you know
not just that lah beauty in terms of you know right uh now we are all going to that stage of working kan it's always kalau it's always macam you see this um
not just competition but macam okay if you are pretty then you might get that job have you heard about this I had experienced that macam sebab this person is sexy ke apa ada landed job
I mean that is for us yang mungkin macam of a lower standard
betul betul asalkan orang tu baik kita dah kita bersyukur eh I mean like as long as the person is good then by all means go ahead you know
tapi uh beauty in appearance or beauty in mindset like personality wise would is that uh
this we can say about our macam okay in the future kalau you nak cari um
is beauty important macam appearance wise or the best is macam mindset or the opportunity of behaviour what do you think about this
ya tu memang tu memang tu memang
ada yang suka cute cute ada yang suka macam E-boy E-boy
uh no err not not not the first uh judgement because because first judgement memang is just gonna be appearance and a bit of hi and hello but uh overall macam to to find that the quality wise for a for a future partner
okay kau okay kau kau share kau share dulu cause ni pun uh is an interesting fact
true true I mean for me I think that is considered beauty sebab okay some people say intelligence is beauty
intelligence is beautiful so actually appearance is is nothing macam okay lah first judgement yes appearance tapi kan people say kindness is beautiful to me intelligence is beautiful to me or macam
uh macam the the act of uh sharing macam
uh caring the your you punya personality that is beautiful so
macam I think beauty eh is is
is again subjective sebab
ada orang eh they say macam asalkan kau kemas kan macam kau err you are clean you clean yourself macam it macam bukanlah you I'm asking you macam pergi plastic surgery to be beautiful no no I think I think ya as long as you your the cleanliness of your of your the state
but but overall macam the of how you take care of yourself macam for the macam kita how we how we like its like macam you know like we we kita basuh muka something like that you know
the sense of beauty sebab okay macam beauty eh is again macam very it can be very um
nak trying to fit in inside the society that you are in you know what I mean
you know uh I I got this macam macam experience kalau we we talk with our friends ke apa we always like ada juga topic topic yang macam ini maknanya macam anxiety anxiety of being in a crowd of uh people
uh again it's it's about um macam low self esteem you know kau ada face gitu tak aku ada I I have low self esteem you know cause I do have insecurities insecurities that macam to me I find that
macam kau do do you have any like um
insecurities ataupun macam low self esteem towards this kind of uh topic
I pun sama
sama sama sama sama for me sama err like I think
susah eh macam
unless kita kes yang macam our confidence level is very high ya but of course
terdetik lah kat dalam hati tu mesti ada yang setitik yang very kita rasa macam eh alamak you know what I mean
I I came across this one uh uh apa tu uh it's a meme lah the it's a kid the kid says macam the kid was saying uh dia like macam to god tau god uh
okay but I think betul lah macam
for me pun times yang I I I would say to myself like
if I'm not smart then at least make me beautiful lah you know which is a wrong mindset sebab that means eh
if I'm uh pretty I will get somewhere I would get uh at least a modelling job ke apa you know at least I have something tapi
tapi okay siapa tak nak lawa kan siapa tak nak handsome buat apa dalam dunia ni
um tadi nak tanya tanya seribu question boleh
I think kan for me okay kita kita perempuan kan but I I think um generally generally speaking kan I think it's the girls is it but not me lah
subjective subjective but but I think kan it's more towards the girls sebab kan kau tahu lah macam we have like boys and girls is different what kita punya how we hangout how we
pergi towards that that
that apa tu tujuan like okay I'm gonna find this kind of clique
to you apa to you which one for you
ya ya ya macam in terms of gossiping also lah you can say that dia orang macam more towards okay maybe gaming or like like like
some other stuff which macam for for girls maybe some of them will talk about eh look at that I mean eh macam eh have you heard this about I heard about macam some of my friends uh classmate dia macam eh kau tengok tu eh kau tengok dia ni eh kau tengok you know they we they are always macam
that's kind of the topic yang
for you know me and you kita tak kita we don't go to that because we we have other other better topics to talk about
kaum wanita lah it's always kaum wanita
tapi ya ya but uh uh um to mention macam orang yang tak lawa
tak but it's kini it's how society pandang you know what I mean
maybe okay maybe we can talk about society you know sebab this is how society looks sebab to be honest who started this thing called macam
uh okay uh kau tak lawa kau tak boleh kawan dengan kita atau if you're not if you're not handsome or if you are like this uh or if or if you're
this of this race or something then you cannot be cannot be cannot join inside this society who started this thing mesti ada dulu maybe in history ada jer yang macam
okay kalau you macam ni I you see it all started it's not it's not it's nothing to do with um you can say ni lumrah manusia tau you know kau tahu benda ni macam this human standard the world doesn't do this tau it's us the humans that
that did did did this kind of thing that it makes it into a problem actually kalau kalau we all treat people the equally uh got nothing to do with beauty there maybe
there will be a lesser percentage of people having uh insecurities there will be lesser percentage of people being low of low self esteem sebab it's how which society you are if you are in singapore okay but then
macam okay I'm not gonna I'm not sebab you get it's subjective it depends some ada some parts of the world takde macam gini but some parts some of the world
that is very macam sebab it's all about the fashion it's all about the the the vibe that is very is very concerning what that's why ramai orang macam ada yang every article is that people suicide you know
tak payah cakap pasal you macam gini kan it it can be because maybe sebab uh you are having this disabilities which I I very pity this for people because how could you judge them how could you bully this kind of people I mean they got they they never do anything to you what betul what macam
dia orang tak kacau kau apa or like they judge you base on your uh clothing ke based on your I'm not gonna say about appearance but maybe we can uh about also about also macam status
hierarchy system macam kaya and poor
is is tak berapa bagus
not just beauty tau macam pasal poor and rich pun boleh jadi problem you know because of that people get bullied people got outcast people I've seen uh kau tahu kan macam kat sekolah kita kita nampak kan macam budak budak ada yang kena outcast kan you know what I mean
that macam uh the economy won't go if there isn't any hierarchy you know what I mean
that that is true that is true dysfunctional something okay you got to search for that uh after this dysfunction but I tell you a bit macam betul lah like
takkan semua sama right pekerja then if like that if like that some people also don't want to do work what because
true true true so memang ini
lumrah lah eh memang memang it's the world lah it's just it evolve like this lah to be honest mesti there is there is gonna be uh plus minus there plus minus macam you know macam kau tahu okay uh dunia hiburan
about okay uh western world atau K pop eh macam for example that kind of thing
usually yang lawa jer pun yang disanjung disanjung disanjung
eh actually no actually no I think it just it just involve in the korean punya
the K pop world you know what I mean sebab in western world we don't look at beauty what we we we judge based on uh music wise kalau kita suka kita suka macam for example like
uh there are uh idols macam mana eh
macam okay uh like
tak I think macam it's different kita tak boleh compare we cannot compare like western punya industry like the hollywood and and also K pop sebab K pop I I it's always gonna be the most handsome idol atau the most prettiest idol that's gonna get that fame
yang lain semua you know especially when you're in a group of uh like of kau pernah kau pernah uh come across this article tak dia macam there's this one idol dia punya member tak berapa lawa tau macam
to me it's fine lah but it's ada sikit macam different daripada ada ada lain lagi lawa then all the all the macam the paparazzi right would is taking the photo of that person at the side where where the the other member that is tak tak not of a pretty tapi is in the middle
so I think that is also rabak lah to be honest
ah memilih kasih padahal sama group tau padahal they are in the same group
to me I think music or acting is just okay acting is a different thing but music wise if the music is good then go ahead lah like like why sanjung uh idols that are very pretty or handsome when you don't even know them no you don't know what
their personality whether they are they good people sebab ada jer yang news turns out that oh this idol did this this idol did this it's a bad thing but then the fans tak boleh tak boleh percaya tu the fans doesn't uh
yes you said it betul apa
macam you have to move on because you you know this idol this idol doesn't know you
you wish tapi okay but see this is how beauty
beauty eh macam
uh sexiness ke based on their face ke or whatever then then it's it's it's gonna go towards uh bad punya
okay not I'm not just talking about the K pop there I'm just talking I'm talking about okay perspective as uh the macam those those fans yang sanjung sangat kan it's not uh it's not it's not a good habit for them what sebab
sebab right when things doesn't go their way then they they are not inside the reality world you know they they maybe can start to like macam harm or they can start to like threaten which is not a good thing correct or not
macam kau tak payah ada beauty then you you you that doesn't mean that you cannot achieve success you know I mean
tengok jer macam um oprah oprah oprah winfrey you know she's not like the lawa the most beautiful whatever right but she got that that that kindness in her she got that skills she got that uh hosting punya and she can be successful you know what I mean
yang benda uh success
it also goes with macam top uh fashion wise you know what I mean
macam kau tahu kan dulu uh okay zaman sekarang right you know if you were to just wear like uh sloppy
macam T-shirt and cause that's what I I do sometimes you know but and then kita pergi kedai mamak something like that right
kedai uh kopitiam or something like that people might like
nowadays people might think macam they they will look at us like eh dia ni biar betul you know what I mean like
like are you are you are you seriously going to wear that you know and that's it that's where kita kita I'm gonna feel macam
tapi get it it's it's how era goes you know sebab zaman dulu imagine if okay right now this is the the beauty standard is like this right dulu time maybe like early two thousand
a dress with heels to a kopitiam people will look at you macam eh you biar betul
lain macam but but right now if you were to do that maybe people will like
uh think macam oh kau lawa macam it's fine
so see how this uh the the era macam how uh move eh you know what I mean
lain eh which is weird eh macam kadang-kadang macam bila kita fikir wah
as technology becomes more macam
orang kata apa lagi gempak then
jap eh
tak tahu no no no no no I'm not talking about you as in macam those people who are who dress like hipsters they are not hipsters dia orang nak step jer macam they just follow the trend you know what I mean
I think there is like macam photos trend I guess kita kita use simpler uh simpler terms eh
as you know macam around starting to see because here I feel it
you know what I mean sekarang uh is we are living in the world where
social media is a thing is uh macam instagram you see what people post you might want to follow you know what I mean
uh this kind of thing uh macam pinterest uh
dulu tumblr okay tiktok sekarang tiktok kan
sekarang tiktok where
the you you I mean you we see everyone's punya life you know what I mean
all the youtuber all the your favourite idols ke your punya favourite punya artist uh kim K ke whatever you can see through just from your phone or your
you know what I mean so maknanya
due to that that's why uh people are like following macam okay macam E-boy E-girl you might not be an E-boy E-girl tapi you just want to fit in or you just wanna ya you wanna look cool
tapi to me I think
you can you can follow whatever you want tapi kalau you have that mindset of because I wanna look cool I think that is not the right thing err you know what I mean why say you you if you want to dress up because you you you
you kind of like suka dia punya style macam some people you can we see oh I like I kind of like this style I want to try
ya go by all means tapi you shouldn't change your attitude your your personality because you are now in this this group ya macam that is that is not the right way sebab macam kau kena genuine with yourself lah macam
imagine you are not like that right tapi sebab kau nampak uh your maybe your cliques are all macam
uh going towards the the this kind of people and then you change your personality not just so if you if you uh if you just change your clothing then it's fine tapi you change your personality your whatever
because of your friend then it's not a good thing kalau if you change for the better then by all means go ahead because that means that is a good uh circle of friends that is a good company tapi if you start to macam okay maaf cakap eh this can be very sensitive sebab imagine if your circle of friends uh macam smoking
then you you follow but actually you you know that is not you know that okay maybe you know that is not right tapi you buat
because you want to fit in then I think you shouldn't uh people like this they shouldn't do it because you should just stand for your own right macam you you don't need to fit in why you want to fit in macam
with people macam mana eh I I say you don't need to get okay macam mana kau nak get this thing
so macam you know like um you know they say there's a saying macam uh everybody goes comes with you but can't go with you it's like macam macam mana eh like
err macam the journey like imagine you you want to go to the next level
ya ya or or you you find someone that have that same mindset tapi you you don't
but because everyone's macam kau
needs a level up you know what I mean macam level of for the good
tak bagus lah tapi macam like see this is how uh trend setting macam
it's not gonna be is is is a beneficial to a certain extent if you know if you knew it tapi if you don't know but you follow the bad company of friends ya maybe you can touch this topic later tapi if you follow that kind of group yang buat benda tak elok then uh then you should
you should have your own pride eh macam you know what I mean kau punya pride kau tak payah follow orang lain punya orang lain punya instruction ada betul
boleh boleh boleh shoot jer shoot
pandang rendah is it pandang rendah you look down on them oh
where you stand macam mana you know what I mean like if you are going towards that big group macam tadi kau cakap
as long as it's of of a good value then by all means go ahead macam if the crowd is gonna be supporting you in terms of your macam it will lead you to a success atau macam lead you to good stuff good vibes then by all means go ahead sebab if you know the circle of friends is good
by all means go ahead tapi kalau you think there is not of good but you just want to fit in based on
the people's sebab you nak ada you nak ada friends you know what I mean like quotation macam you nak ada friends punya pasal then you go in but you know that you don't fit in but you just want that that popularity then it's that's not a good uh there is not a good tujuan sebab kalau kau really nak
I mean you know some people macam for me no eh macam for me I got this thing where
kalau aku takde kawan then I'm not gonna I'm not desperate for friends like I just I I mean you know there are some people
kita nampak I've I've I've seen this
they they they okay they got problem with the friends and then they they dia keluar from the group kan dia keluar from the clique and then dia cari orang lain immediately just because you don't want to seem alone
but but then then then like that much macam you like like tak bagus lah I I rather be alone you know what I mean I I rather people see me as alone
and I have my own uh pendirian daripada
I I think uh I need to find I need to find a friend because uh because people might think nanti macam I got problem
same goes like your question tadi whether that loner is degrading themselves no I don't think so sebab if the loner if that loner sometimes loner tu feels that
there's nothing wrong uh he he or she is of a good uh direction even if the person is alone go ahead I I kita support aku support tapi kalau
sebab you know people who are alone they might they might have problems or or stuff that we don't know of and we cannot judge based on oh kau seorang maknanya apa kau takde kawan you know like you don't have friends
come on that is childish lah I think we should all be mature enough to feel that maybe the person like to be alone because you know if he's an introvert because some people some extrovert also likes to be alone you know macam they don't want to go with the crowd cause it's
sebab if you want to go for me eh aku aku I like to keep my circle of friends close macam just a small circle of friends that I really call true friends you know sebab to have a big friends bigger friends in the crowd do you have to have the commitment you know what I mean and is it gonna be beneficial macam mana eh
you know kawan kosong and kawan that is really true
ya so back to your question where kalau the loner is degrading or not or
let what people think go ahead society if society doesn't like you or doesn't like what you wear or doesn't like your face or whatever right they they get did they will always throw find some ways to throw head to to to degrade you whatever but kalau you it's hard it's hard to say macam for me you know I just say but if I were to
tapi what I I can advice macam
tak payah kisah pasal orang-orang yang gini sebab they they they don't deserve your friendship they don't
dia orang tak layak pun sebab kalau they they judge you they whatever they insult you then are they of a good friend then no
macam you you know kita aku case macam the clown eh macam the class clown and then and then when I okay okay for the kita ni ni macam podcast eh tapi macam okay for those who tak tahu
aku I'm I'm okay I won't say that I'm I'm ambivert macam I'm
an extrovert and also I prefer like alone time or whatever right but when I first met mahirah kan macam okay dia macam pendiam tau but actually she's not you have to get to know her to know her
tapi uh mahirah aku
ya it take a long time not years lah tapi but no maybe years for somebody but for me it's a it's a connection
but no aku respect kau sebab okay you you call yourself introvert right
but you are successful kau
for those who tak tahu
kau chairperson seh kau your leadership skill is really aku sanjung aku macam aku tabik err sebab your leadership is the best
and those who don't know don't know tapi once you find good people right you you stick to them macam for me thank you for being
my friends chey macam sedih pulak jiwang kenapa pulak sebab sebab it's true it's true
ya around sec two is where we kita more like kita dah kenal sec one but sec two is the year where
kita macam eh dia ni dah gila dia ni dah gila
kita punya gila-gila dah start kita punya gila-gila kita punya hantu hantu setan dah start eh dah start eh ya that's that's tapi wow those are the great days no those were the days where kita don't give a shit about appearance wise you know what I mean
kita kalau like eh how beauty what ever no kita macam kalau kau baik kau
kawan macam kau boleh gang dengan kita go ahead like come advice kita takde macam
seek uh clique clique mana ada kita open seh open macam ni
whoever nak join join asalkan kau uh you have that
you I mean uh sometimes you are good you know I mean kau kau orang baik tak payah macam pandai ke apa tak payah tak we don't we don't we don't do that
no kita tak kita tak
ya and now that we are matured right kita punya topic pun makin mature eh
friend pun kita dah macam we we we talk about mature stuff now and also confirm kita ada joke around but
we we kita takde mahu kita we we don't like really like judge people I think
tapi that's that's the that's the good thing about our
yes aku aku respect beauty those people who I find really pretty right aku macam aku macam respects seh like you know what I mean like like macam celebrities I would like wah
like wow you know what I mean macam uh models yang macam handsome pun aku macam wow you know like
aku aku take that as a role model you know like wow that that is
macam wow lah you know what I mean
there are some macam kau tahu you know mira filzah tak
dia punya beauty kan
and her personality oh my god dia full package you know she got the personality she got the great voice dia punya voice kan lemah lembut kan and then dia pun lawa dia dia okay
dia tak lawa lawa tau
but her lawa is very sweet type you know what I mean macam kau like sedap mata memandang you know what I mean macam you you you can just like look macam
that kind of beauty aku macam respect sia aku aku aku tabik
wah that is good that is the best kalau you've you got the full package you know that you are beauty and then you are humble about it wah
kalau kalau western pun kau kau handsome tak western kalau western hollywood style
kalau aku siapa eh
okay we we okay we we don't know like their personality how lah but but there we but we appreciate their dia orang punya beauty
yes we appreciate kita tak macam
jealous or judge you know like eh rambut kau lawa tak tak eh no no uh when when we judge is because kau punya character
like like you you are you you you are pretty but then you are like very snobbish or like you are very arrogant and that that is when we like macam alamak come on lah you waste you waste your beauty
why waste your beauty but you know some people don't know that macam
like macam you know what I mean it's it's how you are brought up juga lah how does everyone
she's beautiful to me and her character macam yang macam motherly kind of uh you know what I mean of how she brings me out aku
of a role model like wow like like macam
macam kita kita we wanna be someone like that you know what I mean
we wanna be someone like that that's that's what I see macam
and and how dia macam ajar like even when she come back work she still like teach my younger siblings
macam ajar then wah
um tak payah cakap pasal beauty lah it's macam dia punya attitude wise you know what I mean
the is that tapi kalau macam if you want to say like like western punya or like macam barat
uh pelakon ke apa kan then I would say neelofa
is the ya malaysian punya actress host uh business woman sebab kan uh kalau kau tak tahu kan dia buat this brand apa yang neelofa punya tudung and then she's she's she's successful sampai pergi uh
milan uh to the the business berkembang
she is a great uh host she's a great actress also and she's a great business woman and that and at the age of thirty I think she's thirty right now thirty one or something dia masih belum berpunya she's still single but her driven of uh being that success both dunia and akhirat aku boleh cakap
it's it's like wah macam
it's something that macam you god bless you you know
uh role model because some more is a woman ya women and and malaysian and uh of a islam uh muslim also so ya that's that's a great thing apa tadi kau nak cakap
betul betul betul the I mean the the the life the hereafter lah
ya tu oh my god singapore living ya
why ya true true it's hard to find someone that of both that is wow I think memang it's very rare no not just both tapi your character pun baik your personality pun baik
I have the most the utmost respect the utmost macam
role model lah I think that is what we call role model being both are woman or man yang macam you know that you have okay for the guys handsome uh bekerjaya and um uh apa we can cakap apa faithful is it faithful and then um of a good personality then
memang susah nak cari but these are the people yang macam you risau tapi again to those yang kita okay kita boleh uh rumuskan eh sebab we got like a few more minutes tapi um what I can say is that we shouldn't just um we shouldn't just
uh okay what's that word eh I want to say that this kau tahu kan macam kita kita jangan just tengok yang lawa kita just tengok yang handsome you know what I mean we we don't we don't err okay don't pay attention okay as in like don't pay attention to all these or to the beauty of appearance sebab
it will just make you rasa diri you yang kalau you know that you are not of that beauty standard it will just make you more depressed or like social anxiety or like self esteem it it will decrease your self esteem also
so I feel like we atau whoever shouldn't pay attention to that because you just bring us down what like we won't move on we won't we will live in fear of being judged or being outcasts then
as long as you in order to to overcome all this right just work hard and be your this macam successful of yourself just to be a better version of yourself kalau just you know what I mean like
betul you know what I mean ya right there's the there are other aspect just just be of uh just be humble be kind I think kalau at the end of the day right
you can people will love you even more than just those beautiful without character betul tak
so just ya just be on that don't worry kalau
yes be comfortable in your own skin it's hard to to directly macam choose to that but slowly slowly I think I think as long as you macam you work hard to become what you want to be and then you you your character is nice you don't you when if you are up there you don't judge the people below you because you never know bila
so then you just be humble lah macam
you know what I mean macam we get five years back what we we regret
it can be anything doesn't need to be of like what beauty but it can be anything then baru kita move on to ten years down the road what should we
macam it it it has come to a point where
macam because of beauty lah because of like insecurities and like low self esteem I tend to like
I I think myself ni macam takde value
and it has come to a point where macam whatever people take one for me aku macam mengalah aku like okay give in give in give in cause I felt like
to have like prioritise in me sebab I I tend to like
to like macam jaga hati orang ni jaga hati orang ni jaga hati tapi siapa nak jaga hati kita orang seh
you know what I mean so it has I should be more macam have that confidence which I I aku tu tu last time eh tu last but right now I have I work on that and it's it's I find that
so to the next ya uh future advice for your for the next five years or ten years down the road apa kau punya advice
true true that is that is important and macam to just have that little selfishness in you so that
ni is important betul okay
ellen punya ellen put aside eh tapi tapi
betul this is my pendirian I know where
higher status kau manager your kau they treat me they treat us macam kita ni beginner but we because because of our age then they they they degrade us you you know what I mean so I aku macam to me I would never treat anyone like that be it even if one day aku
treating people nice is you is a must sebab how can you judge sebab I got people around me macam they they judge okay for example
kalau kau punya job uh macam uh cleaning wise ke apa kan
kau why would you uh I've seen this this is another topic err like for me okay I just share a bit of my intern eh I was treated badly by the supervisor
it's because uh kita they can bully us you know cause they think us we are like uh kuli we are like beginner
kita macam baru masuk industry then they they they bully us they they not just uh okay if we if we are bad right if we are rude then by all means I deserve that treatment tapi if we are respectful if we are willing to learn but you you treat us like macam kita sampah or like you insult us you
you treat us badly you you you you call you are racists I I got you know a job interview and the guy was racist to me but then I felt like oh my god you you you you forget where you where you start you kau kau dah lupa diri kan this is what happen when kita lupa diri so I I I just want to advice myself that oh my god please
nadia don't ever lupa diri sebab one day kalau I get that extra money ke I get that extra title ke I might forget about myself and people below me
because I myself experienced it how bad it is and I know how it feels like to be treated that way so in the future I advise myself that never treat people that way because you will never know bila this uh blessing will be taken away from you you know what I mean that's uh

there's only one in a few times ah tapi banyak kali macam
nanti kalau berbual dengan dia kadang kadang nanti ada intellectual talk dengan dia so macam kadang kadang aku macam just borak dengan dia macam biasa kan tapi kadang kadang nanti ada intellectual talk
abeh dia nya intellectual memang bagus ah macam entah budak budak soci semua gitu eh
ah macam fikir ah gitu macam dia macam that time pun kita discuss pasal
in macam different races in singapore ke tak payah macam gitu ah
ah habis kita cakap all the pointers macam actually tak payah semua
aku rasa kita kena ah
entah aku rasa tak tahu cause macam
okay maybe in the future then tak payah aku rasa in the future macam sekarang still kena ah cause
no ah macam sekarang terlalu awal macam I mean right now technically kau nampak orang kau dah tahu dia india melayu atau cina kan
in the future pasal aku rasa there will be like a lot of cross cultural nya marriage ah mixed
sampai kan dah terlalu banyak mix then dah susah
nak categorise so in the future baru macam tak payah categorise ah
ye lah ye lah
tapi macam
okay abeh kalau macam kau dah mix like
dalam kau ada lapan bangsa macam mana
ye lah kau macam macam one quarter ni one quarter tu one eighth
let's say let's say macam okay if your dad is like half malay half chinese then mak kau is like half indian half eurasian
ah bila dapat anak macam mana
alien eh tak
macam mana seh tu
then ah kalau race ikut bapa jer kan macam
it's not it's not accurate kan pada kau accurate ke aku rasa tak ah
and pada aku you shouldn't like ah
macam pelik seh I mean race is something like you're born with so kau tak boleh choose seh
construct ah ye lah
oh tak maksud aku
ye lah okay it's not fair cause macam
cause then mak dia punya side macam mana like
kira kan it's unfair for macam mak dia punya side ah
macam kalau the race just ikut bapa dia
let's say kalau race ikut bapa dia dia tak macam melayu tapi dia bukan melayu pe actually dia mix still mix what
then lagi satu apa tadi yang second nya
aku just rasa pelik tau macam you're born and then macam kau choose your race and then some people choose cause of nak dapat benefits ke apa ah tu dah macam
kau boleh choose to
ah betul lah tapi that time aku dengar macam kalau kau cina
err okay kalau kau melayu kan kau bila jual rumah
kalau boleh jual rumah to melayu atau india tak boleh jual to cina
ah potential punya customers sikit and then
and then cause of that kan the value of your house will drop kira kau sell at a lower price ah
tak lah tak lah ada satu word
as in oh okay okay okay boleh lah
yishun orang gila semua kat sana
kan actually betul pe tak eh yishun besar so
betul juga ah tapi ya lah like
kalau dorang buat a quota for private housing then
tak ramai seh melayu dengan india beli kan
kesian seh yang melayu kat situ
kau dah besar kau nak beli rumah apa
okay kalau kalau kau ada duit untuk beli condo will you buy a condo and will you stay in the condo
kira ambitious eh kau
macam sorang ah
oh macam macam gini eh oh okay okay okay okay
tak ada tak ada eh wait ada ada ah aku pernah hantar makan
kat those rumah
macam gini juga ah tapi mahal dia tapi mahal
ya mm pasal ada balcony okay dia dua tingkat dia tapi dua tingkat
ah all the units semua ada dua tingkat
sort of ah dia dia macam ah dua tingkat kan tapi atas is studio apartment
then kat bawah is like the living room and the bedroom ah so it's like macam
mm kira kau boleh overlooked the first floor kan ah cause
aku rasa government buat gitu pasal they want to encourage ah encourage families macam to live with their parents
so if studio apartment kat atas macam parents nya bedroom dengan
ada ada satu ah apa lagi satu pintu kat atas there's two gate satu pintu
ah then connected by tangga ah
aku ada ni ah aku ada sedara yang tinggal kat sana
tak ah
not nice ah dia nya studio apartment atas kecil gila
ya studio ah tapi not nice ah and then like macam pasal makcik pakcik aku da tua kan so like sometimes the whole day dorang kat atas jer tak turun bawah pun
cause everything is ah malas macam kaki pun sakit pe so tak boleh turun bawah
ya pasal dorang ada dapur kecil juga kat atas
ah then dorang nya living ah living room rak kecil and then bedroom dah
oh back to the question so kira kau nak beli condo ah
kira kau nak beli condo ah bila kau dah besar
ah seh aku pun
ya kalau ada macam gitu I I nak
I don't know ah I I mean aku macam tak nak beli private housing
for investment purpose okay ah tapi untuk tinggal tak ah
um aku nak aku punya kids macam
main kat playground lari lari
tak tapi aku nak more macam
not just playground kira dorang nak main bawah blok okay aku kasi dia main bawah blok lepastu dorang main dengan budak budak
ah at those area kan dorang punya kawan ah dorang main main
ah then ah gitu ah abeh
tinggal pun everything is dekat macam private property jauh sia serious serious ada yang macam jauh abeh like very secluded aku tak suka ah actually honestly aku prefer macam
kalau dia punya neighbourhood macam bising sikit
macam so kira macam best ah kecoh macam happening ah ya
ah bising tapi in a good way nya bising ah macam
budak budak semua main semua ah not bising
matrep naik motor perah motor lepak ah not that type of macam tempat ah

yang keluar breakfast
uh mister teh tarik is
uh apa eh

as in part uh like me lah apa
so you said so so you just agak-agak lah
sembarang ah
can see not tak nampak
ni I'm pointing at it ni
ah pukul dua belas
but then jurong west tak banyak shift ah
jurong west tak banyak shift
every time I check for shift right banyak kat sengkang
ya tak ada
kalau macam dapat degree or
that that that time my friend uh intern dekat vietnam then she she went to what what was it ah
I forgot I forgot ah it's it's uh apa beach area ah
singapore punya different
at ni ah ni pun ada apa malaysia
kesian ah
uncle janggut
then boleh cakap jepun
buy a kampung house over there
she's busy jaga ija
jangan ah
her like stomach area sakit
sakit perut also not sakit perut
then from the living room I pergi buka pintu for my mum
then I gostan a bit and see
cun-cun my mum also ah
come bagi salam asalammualaikum warahmatullah then I'm like mak mak mak mak tak tahu apa nak buat then her carry her barang pasar
but I don't know what she's doing now ah I think dia tengah baring tidur
main-main you see
uh what are all those memes people makan the pot
tak tak I should recommend this to
front load tak boleh ni apa
is it macam laundromat
macam mana nak hmm
ya that was back then lah but sekarang dah kena buang kan so tak ada guna ah nak tengok tu semua balik
so aku rasa lebih aman ah kat sana
ah saudi arabia ah mecca rasanya kat mecca sana semua
no aku
uh aku tak pasti ah apa pasal corruption ni semua tapi I did read over the news that uh ya there were some corruptions by the make government or by the royalty by the royal families itself ah but then
amazing I would say sebab dorangnya taste
a bit different from asian nya culture dorangnya makanan lebih masin sikit lah and it might be hard to find in singapore or asia itself
I will to get a chance to meet messi ah you know I like I mean both of us like to watch and play football right so if there's a chance I would want to go there and meet him ah tapi
disebabkan COVID period kan aku rasa no chance lah nak gi sana nak jumpa atau maybe kita nak tengok bola kat sini pun dah tak ada tak ada chance kot
maksud kau kat mana kat negara luar atau in singapore
so far aku rasa dorang dah main dah start main cuma it's just that no ah spectators are allowed in the stadium ya cause if they totally stop the football industry right the football clubs will ah suffer a lot of loss ah cause they have sponsors coming so they still had to let the games to continue lah
actually tu yang aku pelik ah but then uh I did make a research ah on the internet and I found out that uh they make money through uh fans memberships the merchandises like example err satu apa ni baju bola kan they could sell for fifty pounds and they had millions of fans across the globe what so kalau satu kalau semua beli mungkin they could sustain themselves in a short period of time before they actually recover lah you know before the
ya aku rasa kau pun boleh tengok apa dekat facebook apa semua especially in singapore err aviation macam-macam kerja ah ramai orang kena buang tapi bagusnya err kita tengok singapore government they give a lot of grants and financial ah aids to um singaporeans ah
ah tak lah sekarang aku rest jer kat rumah sebab uh apa to stay close ah with my family
sebab you know I want to keep myself safe and
finding a job at this period I mean it might be subjective lah but I would say it's hard lah ah you know to find a job that ah that is suitable with me tapi
ye lah aku cuma sekarang aku cuma pakai duit savings aku ah alhamdulillah sebab aku dapat save for the past err
months that I've been working as air steward kalau tak mungkin aku kerja lah cari mana-mana kerja
aku actually risau juga cuma
alhamdulillah again aku dapat save quite a lot
I mean aku tak ada aku nak bilang kau kan but then ya I would err the savings that I save
oh ye lah aku
aku baca hari tu kat facebook juga
ah apa kerja as a swabber is it they could earn like
maybe cause err they are finding people who are willing to work uh a risk a risky job lah tu pasal they are willing to pay that much
tapi to volunteer to be a swabber I mean is a risky job so I don't think people would actually volunteer lah sebab bahaya kot buat kerja tu jadi maybe it's better if government pay them lah you know
a lot of people are losing jobs and they are taking a reduced pay and I wonder how people will be able to pay their bills their mortgage and et cetera lah you know tapi
nak cakap susah memang lah susah tapi memang perlu teruskan kehidupan kan jadi tu lah aku pun wonder on how singapore would cope with this um COVID nineteen lah
and tu pasal aku rasa penting lah untuk err ada plan lah untuk masa depan tak semestinya kena cepat-cepat nak kena kahwin atau beli rumah sebab banyak lagi yang kena fikir sebelum membeli apa sebelum ada anak sebelum ada family atau beli rumah aku rasa
err you know a lot of children I don't know lah maybe for them it's a rezeki but in terms of singapore context
primary school children kan tak payah bayar school fees ke or maybe edusave bagi lebih banyak sikit ke you know
you know you got to pay that you got to pay this aku kadang-kadang pening ah sebab aku dapat gaji jer aku kena kasi
apa ni adik-adik aku eh sorry adik-adik aku pula aku mana ada adik kan aku kena kasi mak aku abeh aku kena bayar bill aku kena bayar macam-macam lagi ah then aku kadang-kadang barely aku cuma ada kadang-kadang five hundred for myself like in every month
so walaupun I would say I'm not saying I'm in a comfort zone but
I mean I sometimes I really wonder macam mana orang-orang yang err sewa rumah atau mempunyai apa ramai apa ramai anak lah you know rumah mereka macam mana dorang bayar tau dorang punya duit makanan duit sewa rumah duit bayar bill
being raped which I'm totally uh angry about tapi tu lah aku pun tak boleh buat apa-apa sebab aku pun duduk singapore mungkin kalau aku ironman mungkin aku akan pergi sana lah aku nak save dorang tapi dalam keadaan sekarang aku cuma boleh mampu doa kan dorang ah
tak kau kau rasa kau rasa apa macam kalau err ye lah sedara kau sendiri
tak ke tak ke pelik kau sanggup untuk pukul budak kecil I mean mungkin kalau kau mak bapa mak bapa pun kau tak sepatutnya pukul budak-budak tu tapi
ini kau pukul ramai-ramai dan kau rogol perempuan semua I really
ya I really err I'm really disappointed that um the muslims are treated that way and also another case is sekarang ni happening in this world is
uh present representation of the whole community and as you can see in eh aku tengok err kenapa police dorang err
apa treat all those uh black people with such violence and brutality
where recently kalau kau tengok news err satu orang dorang siapa nama dia george floyd was killed
err aku tak tahu apa yang tak
police police tu fikir lah sampai sanggup nak bunuh apa err orang tu dia setakat err apa ni ada fake duit jer which is twenty dollar counterfeit bills so I don't think it's fair for them to hold him on the ground and kill him intentionally in front of people
err orang masih boleh you know kita duduk dalam negara yang berbilang bangsa kan aku rasa kita masih boleh hidup dalam aman cuma
dekat sana ada this thing called bumiputera where the malays are given
wanted to buy this house at taman melawati lah you know in kuala lumpur or something but he can buy it at two hundred thousand but you can only buy it at five hundred thousand
you have you don't have that bumiputera rights where you can
should be bersyukur you know they could actually get everything at a cheaper cost be it houses healthcare and and you know what actually kan kalau dorang gi klinik they could actually
they uh dorang cuma perlu bayar one ringgit jer tau one ringgit for basic consultation whereas in singapore if you go to a
they err they are involved in this corruption of certain companies and kau aku fikir dorang ni tak rasa berdosa ke I mean
okay ah berdosa tu dah another level dorang tak rasa bersalah ke sebagai seorang menteri dorang ambil duit rakyat
duit eh rakyat dah bayar cukai dah bayar segalanya dorang ambil duit tu and they can just buy I don't know they heard I heard that they buy
kapal apa yacht eh I don't know how to pronounce that if they buy diamonds it's something wah that's no no I mean you don't have to be minister lah like that you know what you think about that
ya I mean let's say that he I mean he should have a lot of money as of now and mesti dia akan dapat lawyer yang bagus-bagus ah and he might win the case and just uh go off with a bail or maybe instead of twelve years he only can he will get in prison for one or two years ah so
is a joke you know is a joke you know kau kau tengok ah kita punya uh how how well
actually actually memang ada tapi err
uh he he's called the yang berhormat speaker you know he's the man in the centre that uh will call on each uh each minister to speak up speak on his opinions and points for his respective
I really err you know in melayu ah they say kesian ah with the speaker cause he always get shout get shouted at by the ministers
you know some of the ministers say eh speaker diam lah eh speaker apa ini you know they are very chaotic you know and
bro uh I don't find it weird ah cause sebab apa tau
all of the ministers actually ada fake degree you know he actually beli
di apa a fake degree on internet or something or apa eh dia suruh orang
pergi ambil degree for him so that he can have the degree for himself to eventually apply for future jobs or something lah I mean memalukan seh kau
I mean kau dah tak
kau atau kau malas atau kau tak pandai lepas tu kau nak suruh orang buat kan sebab kau nak dapat kerja yang bagus and
are recruited uh based on merit lah you know though he they are they really speak well they really project their points and their opinions well on how to improve the life of singaporean and ya aku aku happy ah macam singapore ada government yang stable ah walaupun ye lah ramai kata apa lah ni minister ni tak bagus lah minister tu tak bagus tapi
aku rasa kita nya government quite stable lah and aku happy to see that ya
eh actually aku terima soalan ni banyak gila ah dulu kan aku
aku fikir aku nak duduk malaysia the reason being is that
ah the peace and financial freedom mungkin sebab masa tu I mean still uh sampai sekarang lah aku masih kerja kat singapore kan and I'm earning singapore dollars
and when the money is converted uh into the malaysian currency it's time apa times three apa so satu dolar tiga ringgit and you when you go there kau boleh spend apa-apa kau beli makanan ni baju ni pergi apa spa apa bagai and kau boleh buat apa-apa ah tapi kau fikir balik kalau kau duduk sana
and kau kerja kat sana eh you might not be uh spending lavishly or you know living happily cause you are earning malaysia ringgit example you are earning two thousand ringgit in malaysia
you know early morning four and know people are still sleeping and kau baru bangun dah kena siap apa naik bus atau naik motor pergi kerja sini and okay lah mungkin kalau kau masih muda dalam twenty plus thirty plus it might be healthy for you to travel here and there from singapore to malaysia
sebab ya the you know the okay example kau bangun pukul empat pagi then kau kerja sampai lima pagi and you have to go through the jam probably can take you for two three hours and kau balik sampai rumah lapan malam
and you know kau barely have time for yourself ah you know kau rasa kau akan do that for a long term or
you know try to spend two thousand ringgit in a month there you know you wanna try living there two thousand ringgit I mean
of course ah it's not easy for them I mean aku pun ada sedara kat malaysia and they are actually
struggling actually live in ah you know dalam kampung-kampung semua and um kalau kat singapore apa orang kata is it or gross income lah dalam dalam satu rumah tu mungkin dalam seribu ringgit
atau seribu lima ratus ringgit and
it's still tak cukup you know cause they are living in a dalam rumah dah ada lima orang enam orang I mean mungkin barang-barang murah tapi
ye lah barang-barang lain macam bill makanan apa semua lah macam-macam and still tak cukup untuk dorang so we cannot really compare ourselves to them I mean everyone have their own struggles ah so we cannot justify on what they are facing ah but kan in singapore itself it's very hard you know
ya I mean okay in terms of religion in islam relationship before marriage is haram
I think it's very important you know to have more money to be stable I mean I think in singapore lah you know penting gila I I mean it's very important to be financially stable
I mean what's the point of you having a partner and you are struggling and you are expecting your partner to help you you know to tolong you to to uh you know to give duit I mean
and ya that that's why we the relationship in singapore is very complex and that explains ah birth rate in singapore is declining kan orang takut sangat nak ada anak sebab
ya dorang risau kan apa tak uh tak ada tak cukup duit lah tak ada time and
aku tak faham ah kenapa entah aku kalau ada anak aku tak akan tak akan ada maid aku tak akan ambil maid untuk jaga anak aku sebab
I I want to be there for my own children I don't want to I don't want my child to be nurtured by another stranger you know I want to you know besar I want to saya aku nak besar kan anak aku dengan kasih sayang aku sendiri bukan
setakat kerja daripada pagi sampai malam balik tengok sekejap they don't know I want to be there for them
you know give them kasih sayang lah kau kau rasa tak pelik ke kalau anak kau you know dibesarkan dijaga oleh maid and maybe one day dorang tak kenal kau atau maybe dorang sayang maid lebih dari kau
gitu lah I mean
to have a to have enough money is very important lah singapore kan kalau kau
kau kau bayang kan kau spend
it's not even compulsory pun to have your own wedding
so yang penting I mean in our religion islam kita nikah dah cukup
tak penting pun then after that
ya I mean the the money that you supposedly want wanted to spend on your wedding right might as well you spend dekat kau punya rumah kau can pay lebih deposit
ya lah aku rasa rumah and uh duit um savings untuk anak kau lagi penting lah
this is gonna be super senang for me
apa okay
ya alah so this is my last semester kan sekarang so
classes that's only like once a week so aku macam like
but it's so much like cause the previous semesters uh I was like so freaking like stressed but now I'm still stressed lah you know sebab sekolah standard but now I feel like
so I was supposed to submit an assignment not assignment lah like a task macam homework yesterday but then like she didn't give me my feedback sought
aku mad ah so I didn't submit
for my time table tak banyak apa punya classes
macam like start at like twelve but like the bad part is balik rumah like lambat so
kau stand out sikit lah
no kau tahu that kind of situation where ada orang wave kat kau and then they're not actually waving at you
so why so kenapa kau mad kat aku for the okay uh huh
so kau fikir yang
you thought like I was giving you some uh attitude gitu lah okay got it
oh kau tengah flex on aku pasal dover dover oof
sometimes I really miss just like being able to like pergi sekolah kau without
I thought kata takde like COVID punya
orh I think confirm like my sekolah mala is like
confirm ah tak halal mala
cause like I went cause remember I told you last week the korean punya stall aunty dia kata
oh aku dapat apa ada mala and I saw like my malay friend apa apa nama dia uh izzah from izzah is from band remember izzah my
yang tu ya ya ya
pray I was like to allah to count my blessings semua
no I have you eaten there before kau pernah makan
oh ya the daging mahal ya
that time aku makan dengan arlef uh makan mala dekat I think it was last year
the duck rasa lemak dia sedap
your bapa never let you go makan
macam not my type of food do you agree
no like no the one yang at Ichikokudo
to me rasa dia terlampau rasa dia terlampau lemak because aku makan dia punya
the fact that it's garlic dia dah cut
but it was super like lemak for some reason and cause I didn't take spice I didn't put the spice also why didn't you going as far as I didn't like wanted to be
ya stomach aku ada problem bro aku tak boleh makan spicy food period
tapi I that time I eh you know oh my god I forgot to tell you about this
no because when you add less of the sauce dia punya flavor
to me untuk aku because Samyang kan uh the normal noodles dia punya calories about five hundred
sebab you know like you put it like there's less ties to numb your tongue
to me dia nya carbonara dia nya rasa terlampau
almost bukan
dia nya rasa almost bukan Samyang and babe abeh dia punya noodles also not macam
something that aku eat
aku tak makan that kind of stuff
kau makan dia punya cup atau dia punya
no cup atau the packet
oh aku prefer aku think there's a like a
the cup one I feel like it doesn't like kau try makan Samyang cup biasa not even carbonara the texture semua lain what
no kenyal is like err perkataan yang betul
oh you kau tengah looking through universities eh
paolo kat yes correct
oo aku uh dia punya course is uh sciences sosial
kejap eh
oh dorang ada human resource dengan uh itu
passionate tentang human resource
okay aku I I know akan
sound a bit dunia
I don't know tapi sebab
macam aku really nak try pergi overseas ah
aku just thinking because it might it's not really plausible for me to go overseas because of finances
macam a real thing is it will take two years only if I go overseas
instead of three years I'm aku looking at western australia nya uni kan kat perth
abeh dia punya fees about thirty eight thousand
tiga puluh lapan ribu uh per tahun
if aku punya is eligible untuk scholarship
abeh accommodation I can stay with my uncle tapi dia punya orang was like betul ke kau nak tinggal dengan uncle kau
ya abeh when she was talking to me dia kata are you sure you really wanna stay with your aunty because I mean it's not really a good idea kan untuk tinggal dengan kau punya sepupu semua
so aku fikir forty thousand extra that's
true sebab aku punya uncle dengan aku punya aunty dorang punya rumah is
quite near to university tau like macam actually dekat
abeh dorang ada banyak bilik spare cause dorang nya anak semua dah besar dah kahwin
tapi kalau gitu I have to take a gap year untuk kerja dapat duit
ya abeh kerja kat mana
dah start eh
a'ah betul
dah besar lah
mak dia nak ikut dia pergi overseas
oh mak dia attached to her eh
no but sebab dia dia youngest in the family what so I think it's like expected ah
tapi what I thought you said she's like financially like
tapi her mum let lah is it taking a loan
daphne is the one yang
oh tapi when kau tengah keluar dengan kawan kau do you guys talk about pelajaran atau completely like no
oh so your yours are just casual friends ah like bukan competitive
oh korang macam united ah
eh tapi elisa dia nak pergi university mana satu
dorang ada plan
tapi elisa mak dia bagi tak kalau dia nak
kerja sana kan
kau tahu tak the main macam
sebab that people nak pergi negeri lain kan is because dorang nak migrate tau
like for example kan aku pergi uh perth for university there most likely I would want to settle down there also
that kind of like no as in like if people go macam for
like uh someone from singapore dorang nak uh apa
belajar kat america boston university
so it's like it's meant to like macam
facilitate dorang untuk keluar negeri kita
so macam like the thing about ambil
I saw this uh tweet pasal this guy they took a hundred thousand loan tak salah aku hundred thousand ke hundred fifty thousand untuk uh go to apa university di america
abeh lepas tu he he they took a very big loan right but he got a job starting salary tujuh ribu
so it's like macam the starting pay is a lot what seven thousand is a lot eh
ya I mean if I feel like in negeri america
dorang nya starting pay quite high seh
untuk ah aku punya perspective
no bukan hope it's more of worry macam if aku pergi overseas education what if aku tak boleh bayar balik
right ten year gitu kan
mmhmm abeh ya
not really I didn't make much memories that's why I want to make sure aku punya university aku make as much memories as possible
kalau boleh aku nak give it another run lah
not choose my class kau tahu kan time aku masuk poly I actually chose to be in O two
and that time dina was my only friend kawan aku satu jer
so aku was like okay let me just be in the same class as dina but if I were to redo it again I would appeal into the same course I don't know
I think kalau boleh aerospace sia
but ya so about local university kau nak pergi mana satu and like
not like like course sebab I know kau tak tahu like
uh kau I think I can see you're like interested dalam
bidang uh social services
is it kau punya internship open up your eyes
oh kau tak nak ah
the jutawan di dalam kelas kamu
aku percaya dia ah
oh return of investment gitu eh
um okay investment aku boleh percaya
tapi hundred thousand tu aku tak boleh percaya
oil banyak ah tapi
mana parents dia dapat duit tu untuk start investment in the first place
oh kalau gitu aku macam boleh percaya sikit
ah sikit ah
uh tapi okay lah makes sense tapi ya you were saying dia punya internship
oh kau share tentang internship kau eh
uh huh tu nanti
ya period abeh dia end up kerja di mana
tapi same place tapi online
dia business vibes ah
oh tentang addison rae
aku just I think I'm aku just
dia seorang businesswoman yang sangat gigih
dia jumpa kourtney kardashian
aku rasa kan dia yang paling banyak um
dia punya dia seorang yang sangat gembira all the time
no no the thing the thing yang aku sedikit marah
eh marah
kau do you know avani
kau pernah nampak videos dia tak
no no no kau pernah nampak video dia tak
dengan james charles eh
no aku rasa the only reason I mean I know you say jangan tengok video dia kalau tak suka kan
tapi the only the thing is I don't think dia deserve all this fame
dia punya ya
aku tengok dia collab dengan james charles tau di YouTube
and when they were talking she was completely sangat bosan as a person like I literally macam couldn't
ya abeh charli d'amelio pun aku rasa she don't deserve I mean she's a good dancer
ni something yang aku have been thinking about ah serious
ya nice but does nice deserve hundred million followers kau kata yes ke tak
no aku rasa okay what makes me like a bit angry about charli d'amelio is dia punya latest video dengan maddie ziegler
the dorang buat makeup
dan the way she talk is so soft okay soft can be a good personality but it's like no substance and like no
ya that itu apa apa aku fikir lah tentang situasi ini
but then again their net worth is like berapa million so aku have nothing on them
oh okay aku faham
cuma aku just uh aku baik dengan dorang aku aku think dorang sangat
dorang dah dalam bidang menari dan stuff like that
tapi I just don't think they deserve this much followers lah
based on how they talk like they cannot talk they can't host like macam
circumstantial I feel like because of quarantine semua orang dalam uh
phone dorang so
and I think dorang punya it factor comes from not talking it's just the videos they make
ya so I don't think dorang deserve all these big opportunities you know
yang uh miniman yang baru eh
oh yang trend baru eh
no I don't aku tak minum Starbucks ah bro
oh kau dapat anxiety macam mana
oh ya malam tu eh
kau that time yang aku minum kopi aku nak pass out kau ingat
ya no is yang I drank the whole cold brew remember
yang kita minum tau it's like that coffee drink
that night yang aku nak pass out sebab aku exercise after that
ya aku nya heart was already like dying aku literally was like
abeh I thought running would help it but running makes your heart rate high but then it like macam complicates things aku literally was like about to pass out
drink coffee at all that time aku minum uh
I didn't like I eat at twelve you know like usual lunch tapi aku belum makan dinner and it was already like six and I was already very hungry no snacks nothing
so I was like hmm mak aku ada instant coffee so aku nak try minum jer lah
so aku minum then after that it was okay
but then I ate dinner at about seven thirty gitu like one hour later
time aku makan dinner suddenly aku rasa macam light not light-headed tau macam
abeh tu semua masa nak pass out terus I had to like stop dinner and like sit and like drink water
ya weird kan aku banyak pass out situations sia
ya tak boleh serious
aku macam aku just don't drink air flavoured ah
uh usually I get the like the like the fruity type macam kat rumah amira that time I drank
aku constantly telling you
Sharetea nya lemak kan rasa dia
it's like sikit tea
like two per cent tea abeh ninety nine per cent milk
dekat Dunkin' kau beli matcha I didn't know what doughnuts you buy but anyways
mochi doughnut mana satu tu
oh right aku tak tahu
oh kau pun manis
semalam aku keluar dengan nurin
no semalam aku makan kau tahu remember the Texas Chicken punya biscuit shortcake
ya I didn't I yesterday aku makan yong tau foo for macam six aku dah lapar gila kan
aku eat the same thing all the time
ya aku always get normal
abeh lepas tu uh nurin nak dessert ah
abeh uh kita pergi Texas Chicken tapi aku macam a bit full still macam kembung gitu
so aku macam tak ah then she bought the chocolate one
aku rasa dia ni ya allah sedap seh aku regret not getting one for myself
aku was too full like my stomach was
aku dah lama tak treat myself ah to be honest
eh tapi sekarang oh I think in terms of food I mean
um recently actually aku nowadays tak spend banyak in all honesty
aku tak shopping tak beli baju seluar semua

uh dia nya first yang basic dengan
okay not to flex tapi aku aku masuk
uh aku masuk bilik aku masuk lambat kan dia nya final theory room
oh student do not required to book simulator lessons for this course means kau manual tak yah naik tak yah itu ke
or maybe sebab kau sekolah bukan private
kau next time kau tanya instructor kau ah when's your next uh lesson driving
tak ada opening
he only manjas me when he need something macam nak makan gitu baru he come to me
tapi kalau tak he ignore me he got attitude one
tapi semalam molly macam manja dengan aku sikit so aku macam okay
semalam aku pergi Muji let's talk about Muji sekarang
tapi kau not there what
ya but yesterday I aku gi Muji untuk get a notebook like that
on my laptop tapi tak macam aku rasa macam tak lit kan tulis laptop I I prefer handwritten ah
a'ah betul
hari ni hari apa ah
halloween hari apa
hari ni twenty nine esok
hari sabtu eh sabtu is saturday kan okay period
kenapa bad terms
macam mana amira tahu yang safirah nangis
apa safirah kata
no aku aku macam tak
but aku just feel like safirah do you think safirah overreact atau like she react accordingly
aku just tak suka rafi ah
no macam when I first nampak rafi I knew I I wasn't gonna like him
but most of the time aku punya intuition is right though whenever I have a bad feeling about someone it always happens
wait what other things aku I remember like getting a lot of things right macam regarding all these sus things
but aku feel like aku reacted accordingly though like
that's why I don't feel like super bad because aku rasa just safirah is like overreacting
ya tak no kejap aku nak explain dengar aku dulu
okay so basically yang pasal tu yang kita keluar dengan xu shi aku xu shi dengan safirah makan
safirah kan masuk Instagram dia then I was like I told safirah I'm super angry
aku macam nak message dia gitu ah macam just to
say everything ah macam like why you do this to safirah and all abeh safirah was like no
cause she dia tak reply aku tau do you dia reply kau
abeh apa perasaan kau when dia reply
apa perassan kau when safirah replied
apa kau punya fikiran tentang business dari rumah
oh kau suka makan benda manis-manis eh
oh ya doughnuts are nice to me aku suka doughnuts tapi it's like air
aku that time the last time aku makan doughnuts is the Swee Heng aku suka yang that kind of doughnuts
yang sedap yang besar abeh ada chocolate rice kat atas so sedap
ya I feel like Dunkin' Donut nya lagi air airy
kan macam tak tak tak kenyang
oh kau suka complicated flavours ah kira kan
aku just rasa
sedikit sedih ah tentang this situation
safirah needs I told I told my mum about situasi safirah tau about the entire break up
abeh aku macam aku I know safirah dia terlampau serious untuk relationship
kahwin which is good
is bukan perkara yang jahat tau untuk buat gini
tapi aku rasa dia terlampau serious when the guys are literally like
mana macam it's macam tak add up gitu
like dia nak settle down sekarang which is so unrealistic at this modern day and age
like when dia message dia kata oh kenapa semua orang atau semua orang masih sekolah
she's nineteen lah I mean like kalau nak kahwin at least twenty three baru find a real like a serious one lah
I feel like it's a bit macam terlampau cepat
my mum my mum said macam you shouldn't like you gonna break your heart
you know what I mean like it's so tiring to like go into this cycle macam kau percaya orang ni
abeh last last dia pecah kan hati kau macam gitu jer
ya tapi aku just feel bad ah
then macam do you know about safirah punya parents
no but because like I was also telling my mum like macam my mum said if you come from a stable family
like most likely you won't be out there macam looking for like
no macam like falling like for the first guy you talked to that kind of vibe
that was uh itu yang terjadi kepada irfan apa the first time also
dia punya dorang nya family messed up kan irfan nya
ya eh ni ni skirt yang kau pakai that day eh yang plaid ni
buat kan
sebab dah besar kan
moyang apa ah
damn you saw your moyang
okay uh kau nak start
aku join poly through which is the polytechnic foundation programme so from N levels supposed aku gi
ada ada minat ah so aku tak ada problem
eh tapi
aku tengah doing muay thai
dari silat then go squash
aku tak tahu is just
it's not my thing ah dikir barat
tak tahu ah aku rasa stage fright
then maybe because of that abeh dikir barat as I see is quite interesting ah like to watch not to do it yourself you get ya so
that's the difference ah aku sebab
err that is macam
macam tu aku fight is ya ya ya
ya because from secondary school so I mean wait from primary school aku
uh sepak takraw pe so
that that competition macam orang tengok is normal
aku since young uh aku
not really sociable lah aku is a introvert ya
since primary school lah aku introvert so
but primary school lah aku still had this macam close friends so aku still okay secondary school also I had close friends but
still join takraw which is good and made a lot of friends there
okay that's the tough part sebab aku
aku didn't really got problem thus aku student counsellor so so aku tak boleh macam mess up lah so basically but the student council part also aku it wasn't
and then err dorang kira kan
sebab aku really from a
aku considered mature for the age so my my teachers like nominate me to be student counsellor lah in sec two ya
aku actually tak nak sebab aku just just malas ah then so uh the funny thing is
aku didn't even go for the interview even though I had to lah
dorang dorang naik dekat uh assembly hall panggil aku dorang tanya err
okay aku cakap ah I don't want to be student council then he say okay okay and like a week after that they like one of the student counsellors came up they say oh you got duty today then I'm like what
and then the and then the teachers would believe me ya nanti ada orang hantar aku
go to sick bay nanti aku cakap stomachache and all that
guilty tak sangat right ya then
but to be honest aku rasa dorang tahu lah tapi dorang just macam
macam okay ah can just go just go
aku first job aku was uh burger king which aku finds
so aku just join and then they quickly like train me
after staff day takde lagi
kind of lah because dorang macam err kira kan
uh business kecil so uh
macam referral kan so aku kerja
I think aku dapat thirty forty
kau kerja is a different environment
so kadang-kadang aku kat orang kahwin kadang-kadang aku kat macam some ah a'ah macam gitu just at some park or some event
eh apa dah kerja
for me I at least is why I chose this course engineering right at least is about sebab aku lagi prefer hands on
rather than macam
so next year kita dua gi internship
you quite excited ah untuk shore
uh aku
so aku gi belayar second sem
which is exciting ah untuk aku sebab aku pun join sebab dia punya sailing the part
exciting tapi
scary juga sebab aku aku tak tahu macam
sebab aku pun planning uh
aku start family and all that so ya
even though internship kau dapat shore kan
aku rasa there's still a chance untuk kau sail in the future you know macam kalau kau still carry on with this career then aku rasa why not kau ada dia punya diploma kau ada experience
takyah disappointed sangat
kau stuck at shore
yes sebab untuk aku err
aku rather sacrifice
aku punya time untuk uh
because it's it's not just okay can you imagine macam
ah exactly jadi untuk aku macam it's worth it lah kau go for six months
then got free for like like three months gitu three or more then
macam by the time aku reach macam tiga puluh empat puluh is
even workshop takpe sia fun so
aku suka ah
honestly following the trend kan aku rasa aku
we'll probably be posted to firefighting tapi personally aku nak army
ya sebab
aku tak tahu ah aku just
aku ada interest in the armed forces juga
kira the army navy ataupun air force ah
tapi firefighting pun untuk aku okay
tapi aku really tak nak
um macam dari dari kecil
aku main bola bawah blok ke apa kan atau aku gi skate ke apa nanti dorang datang screen abeh
ya and then since young aku had that uh
image of them macam dorang just
datang sini screen screen macam aku budak kecil kadang-kadang pun aku lepas sekolah
err aku pergi seven eleven beli maggi apa kan aku makan bawah blok tu pun dorang kadang-kadang datang dorang screen check check EZ-link semua aku don't find it
macam practical lah macam kau just kacau aku kan at this point ah so I never really had the interest for police
I think the the the bad part was sometimes check bag aku
maybe dorang check rokok ke apa abeh aku
aku just found it like like weird lah to be honest like until now also I still feel
I I take it personally ah sometimes but but I I try not to because sometimes also at nanti dorang tengok aku
dorang tengok eh kadang-kadang dorang panggil and dorang check bag aku macam just
but ya that's why aku tak nak police
then kau
eh tapi air force
macam mana nak cakap eh
macam ada engineering punya part ada communications punya part
I because to be pilot also susah
kalau dorang offer kau untuk macam uh continue
posted to air force eh kau kau rasa kau ambil tak macam macam
I think boleh tau sebab the thing is I went for the
ah ada dorang macam test kau punya
so macam
err aku betul-betul nak so
months before that kan aku aku practice with this movie so aku aku tengok youtube video
aku take online test
unfortunately aku tak dapat ah dorang tak bilang score
sebab dia ada aku rasa eight to ten different tests
uh ada yang aku rasa senang ada aku rasa susah
honestly overall aku rasa aku did not bad
ya so tapi tak kesah dapat tak dapat
okay obviously kalau ada
aku aku definitely would
honestly kalau
the job areas like engineering atau uh communications
kalau pilot lah who don't mind
sebab dia punya cockpit dia ada dia punya ah
aku tengok macam national days semua kan nanti ada dia punya jet like cool lah untuk aku
sama sama sama six years
so macam aku untuk aku primary school is when you develop your own uh character
sebab tu aku rasa untuk aku primary macam the most important
but ya primary school aku is uh
I think to through sepak takraw also
err develop aku punya own personality
is aku
I'm a quite macam quiet person
jadi aku dalam class pun aku macam diam aku dengar macam apa cikgu tengah berbual
err tapi bila aku join takraw baru aku macam
uh jumpa orang-orang ni semua and
I was quite good at it ah sebab abang-abang aku pun dari takraw
and then the coach was the one that macam kira recruit aku
through my brothers ah dia dia nampak aku dia cakap eh join ah join ah takraw
then then uh aku join and then
and then err it was funny ah sebab aku was
coach aku pun macam confident aku boleh main
I think by primary four aku managed to be captain of junior team
ya so at primary four aku the captain at junior team and then primary five aku captain of senior team
ya ya that's why dari situ aku macam belajar macam this leadership roles
macam macam mana nak uh
sebab dorang macam dorang jaga aku ah kat sekolah
kalau aku tak buat homework pun dorang macam marah
primary school was fun lah cause of takraw I mean
sebab kalau kalau err
tapi depending on tekong kalau dia left hand ke ya
uh kadang-kadang
and then if the tekong is left legged then feeder nak kena belajar campak
atau striker
tapi aku lagi suka striker
takraw was fun lah tu tu pun macam mana aku macam
belajar ah the
sekolah-sekolah ni semua masuk nationals
queenstown primary tak pernah dengar
tapi queenstown secondary ya
oh sebab aku rasa
okay aku remember primary five
against err since the first round kita
kita beat every school
the west zone okay so kita east zone err
uh school ada east north uh west dengan south
jadi kita dari east zone
jadi kita meet all these different schools yang kita tak pernah lawan pun tapi kita beat them ah
err using basics kita tak ada macam fancy fancy semua tapi coach kita ajar macam betul-betul master your basics
kita beat all these schools from
ya tapi aku
surprisingly national that time primary five kita beat dorang juga junyuan ya so kita macam kita ada this momentum ah which starting sampai finals kita tak kalah
uh menang qihua
second team kalah
and then so is it was one one and then my team had to win ah untuk champions
so macam every year since nineteen ya ninety ninety plus ada nama ni semua but never tampines north primary school
a'ah sia aku nangis rabak sia tu
aku really felt the responsibility ah
sebab kita punya vice principal kat situ
but the tampines north tak pernah achieve this kind of achievement
wait delta league apa
think macam
so aku
abeh aku nampak that time kau post kat instagram macam
dorang still cakap apa boys become last at least
dorang shouldn't macam just celebrate because you get at least fourth macam dorang should celebrate the change you know
wah takde love life lah okay tinggal macam four minutes
aku attached
aku jumpa dia through
dia pergi cambodia
okay so total sec two that time ada macam
ya boleh click ah so
but that time sec three uh dia suka orang lain
ah tapi aku don't mind sebab
just find her pretty you know macam I can
oh ya aku okay then
relationship dia tak work out
ya you you you kinda like macam jauh
ah how was it mm boleh lah
boleh lah
like um boleh lah macam I didn't expect it to be hard as it is
it's more to macam satisfactory lah unexpectedly good
ya ya ya and then you macam mana
mm sama sama
mm ah understood understood ya cause uh macam for me kan like uh
I don't enjoy anything online at all from ah daripada lectures
really I cannot I feel like um like like very unproductive it's like err no no is is err don't even don't even get me started talking about it cause like really really really really malas
malas abeh ah tiring lagi so macam
abeh like um macam mana ah your exam punya like err format like how how was it like it's it's online right so macam like how how did it go
leceh ah leceh
oh for mine like the maximum like the longest longest exam that I had was like ah twenty four hours ah so I cannot imagine like forty eight hours was like huh forty eight hours lama gila
like the questions banyak ke like were there like a lot of questions
no difference tak ada tak ada difference
like why you using serious tak dengar
try ah cakap something
mm cause it sounds like uh err dia macam tak clear sangat so like try it's ya like I cannot really understand what you're saying ya
sangat what you trying to say ya
blur blur sikit
oh for me kan ah yours is like forty eight hours so is like mine is mine mine was ah twenty four hours tapi like the lecturer lecturer like give like specific instruction tau like the instruction were like very specific so
eleven questions and then lepas tu um the eleven questions tu like ah the marks were different lah for each questions the marks all very different like some were three marks some were two marks some were ten marks like the maximum was like ten marks ah so like um
ah for like for each question err um my lecturer specified ah like um berapa banyak words
number of references needed like how many references needed for each ya so it's like like some some of the questions I feel like um macam ah tak make tak make sense ah cause like err questions two marks jer atau three marks but like uh dia nak
dia nak um the words like limit dia like two hundred fifty like can you imagine like a like a two or three marks question with like a minimum of like hundred fifty to two hundred fifty words
we had to like really um arrange like how do I how do we answer it like to meet the requirements so it was like um time consuming lah ah which explains why maybe she like kasi us twenty four hours untuk buat
ya twenty four hours eleven essays I didn't like tak tidur cause like ya I mean it's not that I didn't take breaks in between ah but then I did take a lot of breaks in between to be honest
ya and then then nanti last last you'll be like rushing rushing and then like err everything is like all over the place then you'll be like panic and then like you know and then like for I like what um like for for me that the twenty four hours uh punya exam it was like macam
uh it was penat ah but then like
but then like uh how do I say this dia macam
my back crying for help and then ya and um like mata sakit and everything so macam err no it's not very like ya it's the worst ah I would say the whole the whole
like if they weren't lenient maybe I would don't think boleh lepas
cause like you know you know there are times like um uh like I I attended like online lectures but then like macam like I was there but I was asleep
ya ya ya serious tak bedek
all okay cause I had this like um ah I ada kelas ni eight thirty tau eight thirty in the morning so like
I mean being at home obviously your macam sleeping schedule semua all over the place kan like you just like you will sleep at like three like two like very late lepastu like it's a struggle to wake up in the morning obviously so like ya but then like even though like uh um the what apa nama dia
ya so I didn't want to like affect my attendance so like like every time like eight thirty I will wake up just in time like for the lecturer to share the like google meet link ah I would join lepastu the minute I join and then like right ah terus I I would just go to sleep
and then every time when I wake up the class is done like the lecturer is not even there anymore then she left the google meet and I'm still there I mean I I honestly think uh I bukan sorang cause ah when I woke up then I will see like two to three people
in in the google meet and I'm like okay I think we are all in the same boat ya cause no I I really feel like macam
I really cannot I mean physically physical classes eighty thirty I really feel like it's already um not a good idea to like take up eight thirty classes ah apa lagi eh online like tak boleh oi
eh tapi lecturers you semua like
they were were they like mostly lenient or like they were do you had like some macam trouble juga with certain lecturers
mm faham
most of my lecturers okay lah I I guess like they are trying to make it things easy for us and also for them I mean it's it's two-way kan macam if they make things harder for us it will be harder for them also so it's like they were trying their best I guess and cause it's semua benda macam very baru untuk semua orang
I think everyone macam masih nak adapting to the whole new situations so it's like uh I I appreciate that uh lecturers I macam they were they were okay lah but then I did have macam trouble dengan some
lecturers ah cause like I don't know why ah tak tahu kenapa ah tapi like I ada satu lecturer ni she was like um
I mean ya I don't know I don't know why ah cause I've I I I don't err I don't macam I tak I don't really like her style of like how she organises the whole um the way she conducts a whole the whole class it's like
um cause it's online kan abeh macam she doesn't
she expects us to err macam
gone through everything I mean technically of course we have to go through everything on our own mostly like have to do our readings and everything I mean faham lah we have to do that obviously but then it was like I would say like ninety percent like the whole coursework that ninety percent had to be depended on ourselves
ya so macam it wasn't helpful lah she was expecting us to only come to her only bila kita ada questions so it was like very hard for me like ah apa eh like macam cause especially I don't have my books with me so like
I I left my books in malaysia we had to rush back to singapore like during the so we didn't I didn't have time to pack up whatever I need so it was just like take whatever I whatever I needed and then just balik singapore but then like you know so I had I had to leave my books and I really I really I use my books for references like to do readings and everything
ya I mean cause I I don't like I don't like online I really cannot like absorb things online so I prefer like reading like physical books and then like extracting the like macam apa tu the points and everything but then my lecturer was like
ah dia akan cakap ah apa tu
dia akan cakap okay this is the topic we're going to ah this is the topic that you have to you have to read any questions ask me and then she would upload right upload like pre-recorded lectures with slides but only like
on our own so macam I was like ah it wasn't like helpful at all I was like I didn't understand like a lot of things and then like I was like having trouble then I tried my best to like find resources online whatever it is lah to to understand to faham kan
I I understand that she she wants like kita nya level to be like of really university students tapi macam
I mean cause cause she makes everything a bit complicated like the whole process of the whole coursework it was like very very leceh like from the from the submissions and then to the assignments like she was like very particular about a lot of things they were macam banyak gila benda nak kena like we had to follow hers her format
and it was very very leceh and then like
it was very leceh and then time consuming and everything so and then it was group work and which is which was worse cause uh uh I had to handle dengan all those um group members who are just useless
working team members which was hard lah cause I mean you know assignments are like supposed it's very heavy and it's supposed to be like macam equally divided kan tapi like like the pressure was more on like the lesser lesser working members the more work needs to be done right for each member
like I feel that I don't know I I'm just like um malas ah want to layan like
like you know all these drama so I will just be like I do my work like whoever wants to do it do it and then we just proceed if people care enough they would ask the progress ah of it but you know some did some did not so it was like ah whatever like really I don't care cause for me I care about my grades like you did dorang tak kesah then dorang punya pasal ah
but then like for me like I really I really care about my grades so it's like for me I don't want to deal with like such like such group members so is like ah whatever ah suka hati ah nak buat pape pun boleh lah ya like ya it's like
like apa tu
uh apa nama dia like you know like bila physically like with physically it's very hard to meet up with group members like what else online right it's worse
um and then uh like for like certain my other lecturers like they they decided like like yours ah similar to yours like dorang kasi kita choose um nak apa tu nak individual atau group work so it was like okay lah I I honestly prefer individual assignments so I don't have to like deal with anyone you know you just get to settle it on your own
ya ya ya I mean it's your own your own uh I mean it's kind of scary lah to do be doing assignments like individually tapi macam you know it's much easier cause you get things done faster I mean not faster faster but you know what I mean kan like faster in terms of like you just have you just you just do it on do it on your own don't have to like go having to ask or like you know divide work and everything
ya ya exactly exactly exactly ya it's all like on your own so macam settle lah senang kan habis cerita eh but serious I'm not looking forward to the upcoming semester or the summer semester cause I'm taking are you taking the summer semester
oh dah start dah
ya one class aje okay lah tu
same cause uh for me like I haven't I haven't started sebab mm I baru I baru jer register the class
cause today is a public holiday for malaysia merdeka kan
okay tak
oh pasal apa tu
oh jadi
oh jadi
mm or the like apa tu cerita dia like is it
orh cerita cerita dia like what the whole is it like series eh
series berapa season
I don't I tak suka ah tengok series
I I don't enjoy um like I don't know like maybe sebab macam it's either like I get bored easily atau macam I'm just hard to impress ah cause I will always ah sebab selalu kalau I tengok cerita kan nanti like like if macam dia series
nanti I nak tengok halfway jer
sometimes not even halfway I will just macam ee boring ah malas done dah that's it
especially kalau cerita dia romance kan oh lagi malas no no no tak boleh I I really
ya I macam I mean
sometimes you just you know ah macam just to
just enjoy macam for entertainment macam okay ah but then
ah I would just macam be like err a bit aje ah tapi nanti bila dah get too much nanti I macam ee tak nak tak nak I'm not watching this ah especially if
kalau macam cerita dia very predictive kan no predictive predictable kan so I macam err tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh I will just be like okay my last then I'm just I'm gonna finish watching it at all just
move on sebab tu I prefer tengok movies ah daripada like watching like series or like sitcoms or whatever lah you call it
so I'll see lah eh I'll check out and see kalau I managed to watch a good place then I akan bilang you lah
tapi dah habis ke the series is it like done
oh really itu jer ke tak ada cerita lain yang you boleh suggest kat I
um cause uh I when I get like macam betul-betul bored and then I would watch K drama kira like K drama is like the last resort kalau betul-betul dah boring gila then I would watch K dramas
but on a normal like day with like a lot of other things to do no like I'm not the sort lah like macam
uh what I do is macam I would watch rental videos on youtube like really anything like really like suggested stuff right I would I will just watch it macam I picit and just tengok jer
ya I mean just like every like a really a lot of things there kan and macam for me ah macam get bored easily like videos paling lama pun um fifteen twenty minutes dah lah that's it
not like not like macam really lama-lama videos like orang berbual banyak-banyak no no I would just like watch random stuff
if I macam
sometimes I watch like like really random ah like I can be watching macam ah I'll be watching like cooking shows or ya to like macam make-up stuff
or like really like random stuff like people punya like macam room tours or something I don't know I just like really just anything ah
tak tahu ah I macam sometimes tak ada pape pun I will just like
tengok jer check jer it's just like see just see jer like I I'm I do I would I'm not really active lah in terms of like posting stuff ah but I'm very active just being online and like seeing like post by other people lah
not like really really must those people who really post like stories like every day and then like have those like really small dots on their stories tak ah I'm not like that just that I just like enjoy like watching stories of other people then like macam look at other people's posts and then stalk people
not really stalk but like macam look at their profiles and like you know random stuff like really random stuff
like macam
I don't know ah it's just very fun to like read people's like thoughts for me ah macam I really macam enjoy macam baca baca tengok
ya ya ya ya tapi like macam it just makes you like macam talk to yourself like macam eh
like eh interesting eh ah macam you know got those kind of things like is
which like macam I really like ya I mean I really respect those kind of people cause I'm I would say I orang dia I'm very I'm kind of very I very opinionated actually it's just that I don't really express it out openly
ya I mean ya I mean when I do I do ah but I don't do it like all the time like when I really have things to like really express it out I would tapi macam selalunya mm no that's why I really admire people who really can talk about things like especially macam
like you see when like people really like speak up on like uh like current issues like I I really really want to like I really wish I could macam kadang-kadang macam eh like ee I really like like at the back of my head kan macam there were like a lot of things tau I really want to say a lot of things but then like I macam oh like uh
ah uh ya exactly so it's like especially when when things are like like all these sensitive issues right I really wish kadang-kadang I boleh just cakap jer tapi
I I feel that um my knowledge or like current issues it's not like I'm not fully equipped on that like I'm still like I still it's not I'm not I don't like um follow up on what what's happening kan tapi like I feel like
no matter like how much I'm updated with what's going on I feel like I'm still don't have enough knowledge like like the lack of knowledge in me to really macam go out there and speak up about things like this ah
ya ya ya I mean like for me macam kadang-kadang like I feel I takut kat walaupun
my my twitter is like private like private account tapi
huh tapi I I I feel like macam like even if I were to tweet it out like I I I will just so scared of being judged even though like my my followers are actually quite limited ah tapi you know you just have that like fear of people like judging you even if it's not judging you people I I'm I'm afraid of people having like certain like impression of me for having like certain opinions on things you know
ya I mean cause ya cause things like this like you really need you really have to know your way around words kan like you don't want to macam you don't want people to misunderstand what you say at same time you don't want to hurt their feelings
in a way you know you you just want it to be like a general kind of like um discussion like a healthy one lah like you don't end up being like ya you know end up like in like fights or whatever I don't know it's just really cool I find it like macam very cool for people to be doing that
ya ya I mean they are very receptive receptive they are very receptive ah so macam okay that's good that's really good then that's what that's what I find very interesting about twitter ah
I mean I I find out a lot of things from twitter twitter is like my go to I would say macam go to newspaper ah
sometimes memang mm mm sometimes memang tired ah actually we would like sometimes you feel like something it does get overwhelming to me tapi
penat ah baca dorang nya tweets
I think it's just how it is right you can't you can't get like semua orang to agree what you what you what you have to say it's just the fact that you know when you like express things out you have to like brace yourself for like you know back lashes and everything cause confirm have one
oh kalau instagram
tak ah tak tak honestly instagram not really cause like
I follow a lot of people but then like um I get tired of watching stories eventually so I will just like mm I will just like like exit lah when I macam dah malas want to tengok banyak-banyak but some some stories I do enjoy ah but others like when I feel like um macam ee malas pe nak tengok I will be just like
mm mm mm sebab yang the first few ones will always be the one that you always watch right for story ah so macam okay dah tengok ni semua okay dah that's it I don't have to look at everyone's ya cause some people um for me
I feel like I I as much as macam I respect orang lain punya way of using social media sometimes I rasa macam people exposed too much and I don't want to know faham ke
mm like I mean as much as like suka hati lah you nak buat apa dengan you punya instagram tapi sometimes know what they share sometimes buat me uncomfortable so macam I sometimes tak nak tengok ya so I macam okay ya ah
oh cute gila ya cause sometimes they will just like all the um macam celebrity punya anak kan they all like ee geram lah
geram they just really I don't know it's just geram lah
especially those ah I really ah I cannot tak boleh
have you been to like macam uh any weddings like since since phase two
is it yang young counsel eh
pergi dating
letters hantar surat jer
sorry apa
tapi hantar surat like not even
and then jap
dorang hantar surat jer
tak tak like even whatsapp ke I don't know ke like like they don't use like technology form punya like
it's letter right I mean letters macam take time kan untuk like untuk reach the recipients and it's like I mean I feel like dia macam you know orang dulu dulu punya way of like coupling
okay I mean okay ah I think for me right even if you want to keep things like quote unquote macam traditional kan I would at least use email lah you know
you know letters really take a very long time and it's like all the way to medina so macam wow for me I'm I'm very impatient person so macam
like kira macam you know it's like kira macam you have to really
tulis a lot of things you wanted to to really really update you know everything in like one letter then you have to send it all the way
I mean they they macam taking it taking it slow ah
right taking it slow faham faham
macam would you
would you like if macam let's say your parents nak matchmake you would you would you like be open to it
but then okay okay okay okay okay I mean look okay if you were to change the situation kan macam for example
since you cakap you ada someone already like kira you are seeing someone tapi like if you were to change like the whole situation for example um if you are done with your studies kan dah habis belajar then like you not dating anyone
alamak tapi nak cari dekat mana
for okay bila comes to like my love life right I I'm the type of person yang if we vibe we vibe ah so if like from the start if we can't really click then I don't think that that's like hope in it so I will just like you know what it's not it's not happening so ya so to be matchmake right mm I think for someone like me it's gonna be hard lah it's gonna be very hard
ah I lebih prefer things to be like to happen like naturally
I mean I mean I know lah like macam like when it comes to like matchmaking like it's like it it takes time you have to like get to know the person and stuff
which macam I am open to like getting to know people but then the the hard part is like is like when you when you really get to know the person and everything it's like it's it's a whole new thing where you will have to decide whether like is it really going to work out or like you know those kind of thing so macam
so macam I don't know I'm so like to answer your question I tak sure ah whether I can actually
go on with it or not it depends who depends on the like candidate that it's been picked for me but then again like ah similar lah to your parents my parents tak macam gitu ah so ya
dorang macam ah cari sendiri they don't ya they don't meddle with my love life
um I nak lah tapi you know I feel like I've other things to settle think like love is like the last thing I would want to think about ah
and then you know from there on like more on like working on myself first lah then I can think of like things cause like I don't know like to have like sekarang to have love life like right now
ya ya ya ya that's why so um malas lah also like
mm cause like I had like previous like history with like bad breakups so it's like I really malas and tired want to like start again and to to meet someone new no I don't want
ya ya ya malas ah
I really don't want I just macam uh like I would
I would just like I like currently just enjoy that like the apa company of like my friends regardless of gender lah like whatever guy or girl just like enjoy it being friends mm but nothing beyond that I hope
do you have an aim like macam at like age apa umur berapa
I think everyone would think like macam they would get married like after their studies no like everything will be nicely like arranged but right now I'm like
cause like I think to just have degree is not enough so like I feel like I need to like um oh like what do I say how do I say this macam build up build myself up more in terms of education baru macam stable
to have like better jobs and everything kan to have like like a proper stable career then like then then can lah then boleh lah then can lah
dah dah lama kan tak berbual so macam it's really nice we should really jumpa soon you know

ya ah tadi pagi aku baru baca pasal dia seh
entah aku tengah tengok video apa entah then like it's just in my suggestion
ah yang big bang top

what song I think davichi aku tak tahu

eh kau tahu tadi kan
takde tadi pagi aku try bangun then aku nak sarapan ah
abeh then lepas sarapan aku buka YouTube
abeh the first thing yang kau tahu from YouTube YouTube punya wah macam living room nya YouTube ah
ah macam macam if you connect your YouTube to your living room's
what the hell okay whatever then the first thing pop up kan is this ah apa eh
you know jin ifrit kan
ah the the the jin yang play with fire okay that sounds funny but
okay so technically we have a lot of jin kan it's a
but ya okay so kan but aku tengok video dia macam kelakar a bit lah but then
err okay aku skip to first part eh and then when so he he took this err a pair of shoes
cause this house was I don't know macam terbakar last time so ada ashes and there was something and then
so maybe the owner ada perempuan and ada a pair of shoes so this person this blogger took that pair of shoes and then put in front of the door
rumah rumah cina I guess
abeh uh huh
the the shoes is the direction is towards a door okay in front of the door so kira the pointy part of the shoes is towards the door lah kan facing the door
then so he go down you know just checking out buat kelakar cause he was scared so he sing along lah
tak handsome ah
mana ada kucing okay lah maybe maybe for us it's like ah he must have edited that lah ha
ya tu kau boleh cakap macam oo who's the one who change the direction okay so so he continued exploring the house
and then err apa
ya cause memang nampak terbakar
tak tahu ah eh
oh okay and then bila macam dia masuk
I think masuk bathroom or kitchen ah I forgot
and then suddenly like tempat tu very panas you know then dia punya tahap panas until there's a smoke come out of nowhere
dia punya fire spark and then tiba-tiba spread all the way dekat lantai so pasal kau human kan kau akan lari apa and then his live was being cut off oh he was doing live ah actually YouTube live
mm ah so he went out the house or room I don't know then dia try to put off the fire back
tak dapat semua ah only sixty percent
yang kat lantai lantai dia uh hilang kan
then bila dia
he saw the thing on fire no the room suddenly sampai
ya you remember that I said the object was like ada smoke coming out
no cause it was during circuit breaker apa
circuit breaker then ramai orang work from home so I was alone in the lab no interns no what
your tempat tinggal
dekat ah satu bus jer kot
apa tu naik one six eight jer
no dia naik one six eight then dia turun dekat jalan kayu kan
mana tahu so it's like a a palm thing sized eh
he kerja malam
kalau aku aku dah keluar seh
kurang ajar seh orang macam gitu ee
tak mahu hidup please
orang tengah kesusahan kau tak tolong eh
kurang ajar sia
today malam ah
is for orang yang buat korban kan not us
perempuan I'm not sure usually lelaki
I mean kalau kau baligh I guess I don't know
kau import
I think they will but restricted takde viewers viewers eh whatever ah ah ah ya ya
go masjid doesn't mean I always do korban what you think I'm that rich ah
no lah aiyo I don't even eat kambing
no ah only eat biryani and tulang merah
that's the only kambing that I eat
actually pada aku tak ah it depends on how you cook actually
no that's why aku very selective with like orang masak kambing kan aku tengok reviews dulu
err so far aku rasa biryani masjid jer yang sedap
you know yang yang kat sekolah kita yes tu from one of the mosques ah I don't know
it's like for four people to eat it in fact sikit jer cause they say girls always waste food
I mean don't blame us ah we finished it clean seh kita minta dua tiga kali
tu pasal seh
eh you are still growing takpe lah
I don't know korang kira the the high ah
tapi kau pernah pakai yang very tall what
ah yang penting aku tak kan
aku pernah pakai flats uh fifty which is what five no wait to
so perempuan eh
uh eh five tinggi tau
kau pernah pakai that time
siapa eh siapa nama dia fatin fatin nadirah
ah tu semua takde
no lah cause sec one aku tahu
then semua orang macam tak nak join dorang punya group so thirteen me cause I was unhappy with mumtaz then I asked my friends cause they were closer with me actually
then I kept eh you all want to join me kita book kita sewa bus then macam okay okay ah okay lor
aku ingat lah kau ni sec one sec one sec one aku ingat
no they were with dorang ah
ya I mean you keep blaming when like kita orang not everyone you know there's only like a group of people yang cari pasal dengan kau
actually understandable ah cause we were talking about class there what tak nak kawan macam
ah macam tersisih gitu
okay dah eh dah habis eh
but kena force take everything back
I don't want to take private okay aku tak nak stereotype ah but you look at the people who take private O level
tebalkan muka ah
and apparently I I was the only one yang retake
the rest all go out cause previous batches right they do have seniors coming back just to take O level but then now I don't know everyone like very ego don't want to come back malu I guess so ya lah tapi ustazah siapa masniah tak salah
ah dia kata dengan aku apa kalau awak nak retake awak kena ambil fully dengan arab arab sekali semua aku macam eh serious ah ustazah
aku ah aku dah penat aku nak O level jer tau
previous seniors ah like they retake tapi they are exempted from
which what I thought it would be cause kakak aku macam gitu
tapi aku kena ambil everything then aku bingit siol
ah kakak aku retake
oh siap eh
jap eh
sebab dia macam ada good and bad tau if like your your current self go back to the old times like ada good and bad
oh my god don't forget her benci though
aiya I still cannot forget you know aku tengah copying notes down and she was talking I don't know about what uh shakespeare
aku tak ingat ah but
kelakar gila ah sebab I my meja is the only one that is extended out so literally I'm in the middle of nowhere and like she's doing it in front of me I was like
yo how how does it feel when you just broke up and then like eh kau tahu dia macam gini kat aku kat aku macam ya allah
sec two sec three ah but like after dia ni pe
kata-kata dia macam he was very depressed after breaking up with me like bullshit lah
like clearly everyone the whole school is talking about you you know like eh sudah lah I don't have time for all of you
eh tak cause okay cause my relationship was low-key relationship kan of course ah I don't want to expelled what
no maksud aku at that moment
that's different maksud aku low-key is like
ya okay maksud aku low-key kan that time was like cikgu-cikgu tak tahu part ni tak keluar tak heboh-heboh
so actually tak ramai orang tahu that I was in a relationship with him we study ah whenever we sit in the circle you know ah our our own things sit in circle then talk about then like eh amin like shafwa is it amin like shafwa right eh but I know shafwa like amin ah they always go out together aku dah macam
camne nak cakap eh aku jer asyik put in effort ah for me lah that's what I see ah don't know about him maybe he said like I put in effort too then macam ya lah
sebab tu buat aku penat ah
so okay pada aku really shafwa is just the reason
kau world ah
oh just like that guy siapa eh
ya at that time kau pun macam ah
was it the apa
yang is guy
pengotor seh
macam mana dia nak lupakan kau the girl that was dragged
eh aku nak takoyaki nya where to get ah oh my god so tempted
one satu satu for six dollars
berapa the twenty four dollars plus kan
oo tu aku one seating habis kan
eh jangan ah macam ni tak baik seh
eh aku nak try ni ah yang apa Boms and Buns eh
ya ya ya it's just few shops away from Chulop jer sebab dorang tak dapat beli shop tepi
tu lah aku tengah fikir
eh lepas kita pergi Boms and Buns we can go Spize makan wah aku dah lama tak pergi jalan
when was that bro that's not in bedok actually dekat somewhere else
it's dekat ah lain punya branch eh not bedok
I mean same company ah but different cook what bodoh
I never tadi aku makan ayam masak merah seh like I only eat a little
okay but then kan aku ingatkan aku makan sikit cause I want to buy that that chicken kan but then when
okay wait I finish I wash all my plates already then I open foodpanda just now ah I was I was looking at GrabFood and foodpanda tu then like whoa eighteen dollars
ah ya ya ya you can't deny that it's pedas
entah eh
maybe the chili dah absorb or something no
apa the noodle
what do you mean by anak luar nikah
oh tak tak tak macam serious macam in love gitu abeh uh dorang macam eh aku nak kahwin ngan kau ah because like I know I feel like I'm ready for this marriage abeh like um you know the
the parents macam oh you too young you know why why you want to get married so young you know and then they are like no I want to get married now now now what do you think
haram lah like that
okay so it's like err kes macam err okay scenario ah it's like err
they halalkan like that ah
macam apa mm macam nak date other chicks or what
I think I think by the fourth year ah aku dah settle down sia aku dah macam damn this is long and it seems like much of a long shot see
but but to me ah by the third or fourth year ah it will give me like a sense of macam
ah that's the thing lah because of the current situation right like right now we are both schooling abeh tak stable so even if we wanted to tie the knot kita masih takde
like tak ready because of money ya
tu lah
tapi honestly speaking my parents are like scared because like we are okay both I think I can understand from both parents point of view because they like err
they don't want both of us to macam sekolah halfway sekolah halfway then after that err drop out because what pregnancy or we need money to to support ah to support each other or like err
I don't want to commit anymore sins eh and it's not that err macam bukan aku yang tanggung fully tau is like my parents around who has to tanggung for my sins also so it's like aiya I don't know lah susah I don't mind getting married now
macam I think it's kind of true you know I have a lot of
err friends yang macam ah don't want ah I I need money I need money like err aku takde duit nanti tak boleh hidup and I'm like but money is not everything what you know there there is a lot of things that accumulates to life you know ah macam entah
macam kalau kau tak ada duit kau macam hancur ah
like nobody was rushing for everything traffic was normal tak takde orang yang macam marah marah you know kat singapore macam
semua orang nak boom boom boom rush rush rush even in public transport especially in public transport semua orang macam oh alamak aku kena masuk
entah when I was still
correct eh okay lah jam is another thing in singapore because we're so small ambil macam the I don't know in singapore is so dense the popular the popular apa the population ah yes is so dense and like there's this
actually a lot of people want to err masuk singapore you know to because singapore is safe in terms of the health and all that and kita macam number one tau tip top tau
like my dad boss they actually when COVID started in singapore right they flew to spain and then after that bila spain kena dia cepat cepat balik ke singapore
macam kalau kau sakit ke apa kan ada disease siapa kau tak tahu apa-apa kau datang singapore singapore can like handle it you know
donation like that okay and then like err a lot of children from asia kind of thing dorang macam err
suburbs is like farm area macam all the rural ah ah ah like rural area like people
I remember dekat punggol macam everything must empty takde barang you know there was a a lot of land yang kita boleh pakai
and then kita macam
you know last time I err we go pancing tau
pancing dekat macam illegal places
eh aku pancing lah
err how to say ah macam hutan-hutan oh begitu kita pergi kita drive dengan kereta masuk hutan mana entah random
serious tak joke ni betul kalau ada orang dengar ni confirm dorang cakap aku pernah ni pak cik pak cik confirm tahu punya
so err I think kita pancing ah but then after that I think the government know about it lah so no choice right err they I think they close macam a lot of the places ah and then err kita the only place kita boleh pergi is
flats because population kita kan makin besar
kita ah foreigners also coming in a lot of foreign talent
then err apa singapore pun is a district for business tau kau tahu like a lot of people come here to make deals and like because it's a common ground macam
si kim jong-un datang kat singapore dengan si donald tu kan dorang datang ke sini cause we are neutral
ah aku ingat aku ingat the apa banyak macam sibuk kat shangri-la tapi semua orang macam ee I want to see liao ah that kind of thing
eh singapore ambil kesempatan eh but it's good err apanya rasa publicity
ya it was good publicity for us ya sebab wah terus semua orang macam wah tengok oi singapore lawanya shangri-la wah macam semua nak pergi kan
tapi err I err aku rasa ramai orang ada misconception especially after rich crazy apa
eh I think after that that one right so many people macam got to know about singapore kan because they mentioned in singapore banyak kali tu
but the funny thing was apparently there are rumours yang cakap rumah tu bukan kat singapore
rumah tu some of it was filmed in malaysia
okay aku tak pernah tengok sorry ah
serious no joke aku tak pernah tengok
I don't know I felt like it was just too hard cam am I right macam and it's
phua chu kang yang adik
oh betul
kan rambutnya poof
okay K K salah salah
I thought they were itu
dia memang jelaka ke dia every movie pun dia jelaka
ocean eight one is jelaka
he cute I got see him before as in like I mean like nak
alamak takde chance lah
banyak okay K
that time aku kat rumah abah aku then he say uh he ask me ah eh do you want to watch mulan or not then I say
but people say don't support mulan then but then I do want to watch lah macam
tapi I want to see if the cinematic is good or not so
so aku macam okay ah maybe just watch but I didn't really pay attention to it ah
I was not fully there but I watch macam sepuluh minit lepas tu chao
and then after that I came back I oh okay so this is the scene ah ah ah oh ni scene dia abeh apa dah jadi uh oh ya so I didn't really focus but I kind of know macam dia punya jalan cerita
ya why kau dah tengok oo on the cinema
oh apa dragon tu mushu eh
aku sedih bila mushu takde because that was that played a very important role you seh
alamak aku tak ingat [ah]
tapi it changes everything seh like the jalan cerita is not there anymore what
I remember seeing that one the the guys macam fooling around mandi
the mandi part I saw that one
ketawa sial like apa jer K but anyway then aku ingat bila
cause yang lagu dia it keeps playing that's all everytime I watch the music keep playing sia then I was like what is this leh why why the like in the real cartoon got so many songs you know everybody's happy
but then this one it's like keep playing reflection reflection reflection sini reflection sana abeh
alamak ku tak dengar
speaking of movies when was the last time you pergi cinema
kita pergi tengok cerita alamak I forget what was the movie called err
it was like err X-men punya series ah
ya macam this group of kids with super mutants ah new mutants ya
ajak aku then K lah
eh aku tengok ah sia
tak semua ah aku tahu the first one
no not the first one lah the first one is normal apa yang dorang
ah apocalypse aku tengok
back to the future dah aku tengok
aku tahu yang err
err yang the first one the first one ya normal kan the second one is the dorang balik right flashback kan the third one is
ah ah si jean tu
mm wolverine tiga ah tiga
bila semua cinema semua busak busak pula buka bila cinema buka
baru err it was one of the movies that was being released together
takde lah when no lah after COVID bah
eh after COVID eh macam COVID dah habis juga
the there's the scooby doo new movie yang macam merepek ah honestly
eh tapi yang the one that I was the the one I was so disappointed eh was a quiet place
aku macam siala
sakit hati tak dapat tengok it's not released
ya abeh dorang semua orang dah get ready ah I think it was
aku dengar bila but it was going to be released
sekali when the government announce yang the circuit breaker period kan lepas tu dorang macam sorry cancel lah ni semua ni semua and it was like a couple of weeks maybe two or three weeks
aku sedih sia I was like walao so close
tapi boring ah bila kat cinema we were separated see and we were three people
so I was like macam mana ni then kita okay lah terpaksa lah I just ask uh apa
I mean like it's okay what I just because I also don't have any interest right in this movie sorry sorry apa
okay maju cari online ah
macam okay they needed this staff to jaga the cinema halls and they needed this staff to save entry then they needed counter staff
but now they change seh they change to err counter err satu orang so the counter will take all your orders macam kau nak tiket ni you want some drinks okay uh when you pay already there's this like queueing system macam McDonald's
so apa ni
so kita tunggu lah macam McDonald's begitu
even at Timezone tu kali aku pergi
ya aku pergi Timezone
eh Timezone bes seh but anyway I went to Timezone also
ya true makan duit a lot
uh same lah like they just kesian aku tengok a lot of people do a lot work seh then macam to me it's extra work ah
oof kenapa pula
ya sia eh speaking about that and plus even if you commit such crime like that if you get caught lagi like
but ya lah I I think you brought up a good point seh like I think this second job that okay maybe if it's a side hustle yang tak take so much of your time ah then maybe can ah
macam what
like eh walao I'll be angry seh if I have no social life boleh mati sia
oi susah sia
okay the time or money eh okay kalau if let's say I am married lah
ah that's why that's why I say money is tak not so bad ah it can be a choice ah
I think being in singapore macam very I think just singapore lah ya
keeping it to macam singapore punya contexts ah
oh tu lagi ugh
although I have to say that macam uh
like that one that one can say that the government is trying to improve because err there are more ministers talking about it and macam a lot of people are more open to listening and like they don't just macam categorising as orang gila you know that kind of thing
that one rabak seh semua orang macam ah ni confirm stress jer
tak mau sensitive seh ya tapi ya lah err I think it's
have you heard of this macam disorder called multiple multiple
apa I forgot ah split personality gitu macam
gitu split is the one ya kau pernah dengar
aku pun tak tahu sia
uh okay I had actually aku tengok this YouTube video tau err this this there's this girl lah aku tak tahu ah
err then dia macam tunjuk tau macam mana dia punya
disorder macam dia punya err how like she just teach more about her itu [ah] her her macam mental health I guess
you know it's not mental health is just the disorder lah eh dia punya diagnosis ya
and then dia tunjuk tau macam mana like she changes from one person to another person that kind of thing
wow I didn't know such like wah seriously macam ee aku tak pernah nampak sial gini ya because of internet ah ya basically things from the internet eh macam exposure seh
ah ah macam recommended
yes that's the okay honestly when aku first heard of it eh I was like
what ya ya eh apa sial this is this seriously macam for real I've never heard of this sia
and I was so shocked by the err apa personalities that was in that girl you know
okay dengarnya ni alters
ya tak betul not not really tak betul but macam split kan macam banyak power
okay they will get strong tiba-tiba all that right
ah tapi tapi dia ceritakan as much as it is an exposure to this disorder it also portrays a little bit uh macam fictional of the disorder macam bilik
so ya you should watch it you know ah that girl I forget I know her YouTube is dissociate did or something like that kau tahu anthony padilla the YouTuber
anthony padilla ada ah kat YouTube ah then he he did that the interview
ya then uh he interview ah the girl then the girl show got this budak kecil inside her body eh ya then budak tu kecil tu keluar tau
as each alter has their own um role macam there's the protector
ah there's the protector there's a apa mediator there's the child and all that so
aku tak tengok movie dia actually
tapi aku tahu pasal movie dia
macam err like like those scars lah like that
macam superhero right right right they had a motive right together
uh I feel like uh apa ni the movie is good exposure lah
eh I mean is rare to to see all these kind of people like I've never met somebody in singapore ah actually tak pernah aku nampak dorang macam begini ya
mm three wishes eh okay firstly I rasa I nak jadi billionaire
jadi billionaire I feel secure
can actually solve a lot of problem macam if like in case of emergencies like
macam accident ke apa I have the money already
I can like feel rich you know like macam jalan sana jalan sini eh I like this stuff I can just buy I like that stuff I can just buy that kind of thing
so I want my own transport and rumah
so like what you asked right I rasa transport I nak motor ke kereta ke
I nak my own private jet so that I can travel everywhere
tak payah nak tunggu flights pun
like I want to go here and there I can macam eh sembarang eh aku nak flight okay aku naik aku punya private jet that kind of thing
like also kan macam bawa orang lah like can bring you and like the other families to go travel all that
ya so macam tak payah buang duit gitu macam you know sekarang kita nak naik plane pun nak kena bayar for the air ticket right
have the private jet why not I just macam families let's go like I can
I can payung you guys for
transportation ah eh tapi duit belanja tak
I want to conquer a lot of language so macam
ada skill like that kan
like what's you skill oh I can speak a lot of language gitu macam but I want to speak like the common one lah macam mandarin uh korean it's like
common sekarang then
kalau macam kita dah tahu berbual ni semua macam nice right like
since it's a wish right dia macam bukan macam magic gitu kan kalau magic gitu kan
eh sudah aku nak letak magic I can speak a lot of language and be certified rather than
I want to study don't need lah tak payah
you know about yang seratus dollar the one that government wants to like the hundred dollar voucher right
or like amusement park ah all that ada tourism
you want to picnic ke nak overnight
rather than macam
kalau dia dua ratus lebih then
you can only use your your own only kan abeh bayar seratus lebih gila
maybe we can picnic ke apa right what you said picnic then kalau kita picnic pun kita nak kena keluarkan duit banyak
macam hotel then chalet ke apa kan untuk staycation gitu kan mm actually not bad ah I think the idea is not bad abeh kita boleh barbecue lagi kan kalau kalau kita macam
chalet ke ah kalau macam chalet tu boleh barbecue pe
and then macam rumah okay rumah maybe like macam if it's like four hundred we can just
so it's like satu orang like berapa berapa puluh dollar gitu or hundred something like that
then the food also we can ask them to fork out like about twenty dollars or twenty or thirty dollars gitu
untuk makan dengan minum okay ah nice then we can just cook or we can like macam chalet or what we tempat dia boleh masak kan so
we can just buy our groceries ke apa
then we macam simpan dalam fridge then esok tu breakfast boleh masak
semua then
I think by lunch gitu we need to
because right takkan kita nak buat macam so called birthday party tak ada decoration ke apa kan
I mean we can buy macam dekat daiso ke apa kan so dua dollar dua dollar murah ataupun kita boleh beli kat neighbourhood kind of shop kan
so I'm not sure if kalau mm but it's a nice idea lah to macam
buat both
because we can macam save up a bit of money rather than macam
satu birthday party lepas tu birthday party lagi habis duit then
tu confirm confirm kena bayar lagi eh service tu
nice but I don't think macam I don't think hotel is a nice choice if you want to do that kind of thing
cause hotel confirm have their own macam
I don't know they will have their own kind of rules and regulation macam like after this timing that timing you cannot do this kind of thing right
we should use chalet or something rather than that because macam
kalau ada rules or regulations susah ah kita pun nak buat macam we want to save
cause sekali tak save eh uh government pula
ah ya lah like some agency datang ke apa sebab kita buat bising ke apa habis kena bayar lebih eh
err macam
ada rooftop like that ah
not not really rooftop dia macam not rooftop or shelter tapi macam indoor sikit
ah we can we can find the place around there so kalau hujan ke apa kan kita tak kena
because marina west coast east coast tu semua is all
so kalau hujan ke apa we still boleh lepak depan situ
for a picnic with my friends we actually macam
abeh okay maybe kalau kalau macam hujan lebat sudah kita pack up sudah hujan lebat kan
because it's like alah sikit-sikit jer point point point
gitu jer kan
I mean we got the what is called ah yang besar tu parasol eh
ah yang payung besar tu
we brought that also so kita letak betul-betul kat tepi situ we letak so
ah macam ada what is it macam terpercik eh is it terpercik macam hujan kena
if we macam takut hujan splash on us then we put the uh the payung besar
mm even though we under the macam cover kan but still lah we just
kita tak kena ah pasal kita letak payung besar tu
macam glamping is it dia macam wait ah
I don't think dia orang akan macam
err kau nak stay pukul sebelas sebelas lebih dua belas gitu I don't think
I think that's good though but rather than macam we since we going to overnight or something right I don't think we should
err take macam morning like that no we should like macam petang petang gitu
we should rent from petang petang
sampai ke malam like that so sampai esok pagi ke sampai esok petang tu ya we should rent that kind
so that macam
but I I don't know kalau ada macam ada orang lain yang tahu skate macam you don't know how to skate kan
abeh kalau aku roller blade sorang eh sedih sia aku orang semua cycle cycle cycle aku eh roller blade dengan aku
oh I remember that time my eh my cousin our cousin our cousin said nak pergi zoo
merepek pergi zoo pergi zoo tengok binatang jer
both of us we don't really like animals macam hey kau datang sayang kau tengok-tengok jer binatang tu
maybe aku tak appreciate ah but
I seriously want that instead of macam pergi to be honest I felt right it's like one of the best choices
gila I will just research about it later lepas tu nanti kita tengok
cause I felt like kita macam tak spend banyak time
yang macam cousins we don't really have much
I'm like I'm schooling all that macam all our timing clashes so we don't we have the time to macam jalan-jalan together
we can actually macam save up a bit of money ke apa eh lepas tu pergi shopping ke
macam nice right
ya tak berapa lama kita plan eh picnic pe picnic engkau dah dua tiga tahun
I mean I don't really like the pantai but okay lah can
I mean I'm okay with it cause it looks it looks nice the one I just googled just now it looks really nice and I felt like macam
eh macam best jer tempat ah gitu
if I'm not wrong kallang ada
mm tempat stadium tu
I mean kalau hujan ke apa kau tetap boleh climb apa
sama lah aku goal tahun ni
nak healthy lifestyle
healthy ke benda jogging tidak malam siap kerja makan
oh but talking about tu you know just now eh just now mampus you know that time
I wanted to try dia punya rock climbing
cause I rasa macam eh long time seh tak rock climbing why not eh
malu ah kalau jatuh ke apa eh orang keliling nampak dah lah rock climbing dia dekat tengah-tengah dunia gitu eh
embarrassment lah lol kat kallang wave tu kan
we can also macam watch movie also dengan dia orang
eh do you do you think the one that you suggest ada ke apa boleh kita tengok cerita lepas tu
makan makan berbual berbual lepas tu lepak-lepak eh
tak payah ah buang duit ah
I thought this one dia orang dah sediakan tempat tak ke
they sediakan already right they they have their own designated punya tempat pe
so I cakap lepas tu kan like what you say lepas tu kita cycle kan so pagi-pagi boleh cycle pe
dah cycle kita pergi mcdonald's ke
ha gitu kita pergi makan breakfast because we only bring makan untuk dinner dengan yang so called small celebration tu
then morning cycle cycle tu semua beli makan breakfast tu semua then after that
if they want to play at the seawater suka hati ah kan
I thought of like I don't know if I should bring my guitar or not but then macam
chey minah melayu sangat ni if I bring guitar and then
and then you play guitar macam eh macam dalam drama eh
but nice and then we can like macam take video photos
it's either kita macam nak balik rumah ke kita macam nak continue to other place ke apa not bad ah
tak payah nasi ah merepek picnic picnic nasi nonsense
no lah but since it's picnic I already know lah takkan I nak tu buang ni
nice if kita since kita nak buat macam birthday party celebration that kind kan
we could have just bihun goreng and nasi goreng eh sedap
is it kita nak potluck gitu
kita bawa makan dia orang bawa air ah kita suruh cousin kita bawa air
ice since dia orang nearer ask them to buy ice cube also ah
huh cucuk what
gila kalau semua benda kita dua jer yang buat
ya that's why I say dengan kita dua nak buat macam macam jangan buat kelakar
you know you talk about macam letak dekat skewer gitu kan
instead of letak kat skewer tu kan then we can just buy you know yang macam selalu orang barbecue ke
orang birthday party ke apa yang besar tu
ah so we put everything kat situ
ya lah so mi dengan nasi letak dekat situ tapi yang macam nugget ke ayam ke crabstick cuma
tak payah letak belakang lah
but I think we can do macam benda lain I mean
I I thought of like macam
buat roti sandwich or
or apa eh tu nama
I mean you say macam tak nak everything fried fried what then macam tu semua I mean it's easy to do but
whatever lah I mean tengok jer lah if if I feel like doing it ya I will do it
mm actually okay ah boleh ah one one dish jer ah lepas tu kita buat yang you know
uh we buy it's either we buy or we just find yang besar gila punya tupperware tu kita buat yang
buat satu jer lah tak payah buat dua gila kata
goreng goreng ni sambal goreng pula lagi tak payah lah
boleh boleh actually not bad can
air I think air
we are going to like have birthday celebration ni semua from
today to the next day what so of course kita perlu air pe
now like that I want like macam then we half half ah macam one is the normal drinks then uh macam
half is normal drink half is err carbonated one so macam sedap ada orang nak ada air sedap
oren oren carbonated
ya because he say it's better to just buy there lepas tu pergi pe pasal murah pe belakang
boleh lah beli a bit of chips chips yang kita nak okay maybe the chips that they buy is not the one that we want or we can just discuss what kind of chips that we want ah
but then even after we discussing obviously we need to buy the one that macam semua makan pe
so macam if you like macam like me
I sometimes feel macam oh without this I cannot sia I need this snack ah macam gitu eh
so so so I think that one nak kena beli sendiri ah
then mi oh I think oh ya I think we also need to ask
I don't know mi hoon goreng ke
mi goreng kuning ke okay ah anything can
I thought you cooking the nasi goreng
nasi goreng cina sedap eh
you masak nasi goreng cina tapi you campak ikan bilis
I help you potong ayam
okay lah boleh boleh ask your husband lah
dua packet untuk ramai orang memang tak cukup
tapi kalau kau letak sayur macam dia dah macam-macam pinggan like that what macam bowl
okay then like that takpe kita suruh dia orang buat sandwich tapi dia macam gini
lepas tu uh the tuna
ya ya what I mean dia punya roti
roti dia kalau ada crust suruh dia orang potong crust dia
lepas tu crust dia we put inside one of the plastic and then kita boleh buat
roti gula ke apa with the crust
the crust is very easy to do what setakat
crust tu kita setakat uh letak
so that it's easier so and then you can uh apa tu masuk dalam air fryer
masuk dalam air fryer lepas tu you jadikan macam snack keras keras sikit gitu
then you can just make roti snack or you don't need to
uh apa tu you don't need to air fryer or what
ya I like mushroom ball so we buy mushroom ball and instead of fishball and then nugget dengan fried chicken right
terlebih fries nanti soggy
okay ah I think we cun cun nice already ah everything we plan is nice already so I think we can tell them
instead of the one that we want to staycation tak payah lah buang duit lah
kalau kalau glamping tu mahal sangat
kita lepak kat tepi beach tu jer
letak mat kat situ ah lepak jer kat tepi okay ah
nice plan we both of us plan is like cun already
we want to go out picnic we tell them already what so but then kita kata maybe kita should go next year
during kak nadiah punya birthday dengan sambung together with abang punya birthday
we just said that but we never say about macam kita punya surprise birthday party what so okay ah dia orang pun tak tahu
they need because I think like macam whatever they like ah or need
cause I feel macam
okay lah then that one we can bring dia punya husband or something you know or someone else or adik dia
we can bring to buy to pillih dia punya dress ke apa because
kita punya taste tak ada lah sama sangat
oh ya so I don't know if we should buy denim sebab denim mahal
so tak tahu ah kalau kita nak beli denim beli denim kalau nak beli dress beli dress
colour code untuk kita waktu kita pergi picnic yes
since kita
since kita pun nak overnight right so kita colour code dua hari ah
but tak nak black ah common
I want red actually but I felt like kalau hujan macam mana
petir guruh ke apa ow aku takut
takpe ah suruh dia pakai baju kat dalam lepas tu yang tu tak payah butang
tu I don't know ah but we can just discuss with them later since we already discuss everything
so the colour coding later we can just ask kau orang ada colour apa kita ada colour apa ah
I actually like lupa
I lupa nak reply her
okay I'm going to reply her after I makan
then like after I makan I was like
tapi like I don't want then I felt like
so semalam like
I told my mum and my kakak was like
to like clean like cause apa nama dia err yesterday I spent the whole day shifting
my almari from my room to my guest room
then I was doing it myself I had to take out all the buku-buku
and then I shifted all the I I I simpan the book balik
and then what happened to the one keluar you know what time we keluar or not we went out like
so we only went into spotlight and I told you about the patterns that I wanted to beli right
I went to spotlight sebab I want to find
for the inside layer for my mask cause I want to jahit for my
which tak habis-habis
ya so I was trying to find a breathable kain
main thing that I wanted to cari was the
like find the kain
turns out it was like dekat dalam
an almari
tadi tadi while while bathing I was
cik saya nak order
nak order suji boleh
tapi usually like people sell suji that
as I was saying tadi
I was trying to think macam like
err when is a good time for us to record lah cause macam
at five masih very very very memekak
crowded here and because that time masa masa we shot at kim punya place
yang we went to jewel eh I think
like all my close friends I only like keluar with the for like
like satu bulan eh no dua bulan sekali kind of thing you know
or like tiga bulan sekali
ah ya ya ya apa
give it a listen nanti lepas ni
I think the korean industry is kind of like macam
apa nama dia macam mana nak cakap eh
and it's damn big it's like besar gila and
real lah macam
pakai yang the one that I told you about hari tu that it karat
four hundred okay so it's four hundred plus for two specs kan sebab it's like one for one
um when I was buying it I was like thinking kenapa dia punya
kenapa orang nak kena ada promotion for specs one for one like who would buy
oh it's a good deal cause like macam
mum and my kakak ah
patutlah dia jual one for one
sebab dia punya specs tak guna
then I was like lepas tu dia cakap eh cause like
your degree naik or something right
is it just tak masuk akal to me
then my kakak cause my kakak was telling me ah that um celebrities who
share that dia orang beli their glasses from owndays like they keep on macam promoting owndays that means like
you can try off the shelves kind of thing and I guess that's why macam a lot of
specs shop is dekat dalam the display then you have to like engage the
is on display everything at macam the racks then you just take and tak payah
like the the shop that I went to dia
dia dia dia dia I sound like I'm singing oh my god
while waiting for them to fix my kakak punya glasses
like berani gila
don't really show they don't really report the exact number is because macam
they have to let the migrant workers work sebab of the number of attempted suicide cases are rising
talking about apa nama dia um
fight for women's right and all that stuff and then I masuk then I was like what is all these two faced people
I feel like writing and radio is very two faced macam
macam that
but then you only do a little like sikit
but like playing with stocks are like macam gambling ah
naik or turun
my nenek sheryl was sharing with me ah that like
so my mind is literally macam peanut
macam there's there's there's there's a lot of like useful content and some merepek content
different tiktoks everyday kan macam like it like within
nanti it will refresh like and then like you will get like a whole new set of like other stuff
and stuff like that and and like to reach out err to a bigger audience but macam
like I masuk also to tengok what people
no I masuk to tengok like people send me
stuff and then I'll be there for like half an hour and then that's all like I I can only like I used to be able to macam
and when guys do that is like tak ada perempuan lain ke
like as in macam
like to me right it's like tak tahu malu ke like you already like cling onto like someone
try everyone else macam
macam like common ya
they are macam
suruh dia kahwin chef ah
there's a lot of like male chefs as compared to female chefs so kalau dia nak kahwin kahwinlah dengan
even if they don't have like long term macam five years or ten years if it's if that's too long for them I feel macam
they should have at least like a one year plan kalau tak macam
what you menganggur
oh I don't know what to do with my life I will think about it oh serahkan pada like allah and that kind of things then I'm like
where's your usaha man like you can't just like sit down and expect things to fall down in front of you like you have to work for it
habis nanti like if if you say that
if you tegur them about it right nanti dia orang macam
the first time apa ah
who was like cause like his his profile he put there macam
I was like oh he is one eight one that's tall then I was like oo I'm going to talk to him sebab dia tinggi and then like I can finally wear heels if I date him
like atas sikit
macam like a higher angle you know
you know my dock marts punya sandals

I mean at the end of day I mean ah how how much netflix can you watch right within a day I mean aku tengok netflix one one hour drama pun dah aku dah macam lethargic gila like alone like to be staying I mean right now I'm staying home lah because because of this the whole entire err situation
I mean K mine was quite interesting I mean err as you know aku kan buat caregiving job kan to my friend so err I mean yesterday I was just resting I mean the day before so of course err
um when it comes to have to my friend need um what I do normally is I go over to his place um I will like um prep him lah and keep him proper and like aku mandikan dia
uh and then dia nak berak and everything so aku dia and everything then aku nak kena siapkan dia so everything took like one hour plus and then after that
err we were waiting for transport because kawan dia nak kena hantar tau hantar dia so we were like one hour late for the appointment so we're supposed to be there by three
but we only managed to get the transport by like three forty five lah almost four lah so lambat lambat lambat gila so by the time we reached err the hospital
err hospital tu somewhere around dekat err in the east
so it was almost four so by the time kita masuk then the the therapists were saying like err one hour lambat and everything lah last standard procedure lah huh but they would just do their best lah because of this COVID nineteen kan
so okay lah I mean it it then after that aku hantar dia balik and then lepas tu bila aku hantar dia balik after that there was guest that came in so the guest happens to be err like err dia punya adik punya wife punya parents
so of course aku nak kena siapkan lah I had to like wipe him err tukar baju dia tukar t-shirt dia and everything so I had to like prep him and then he was dia pun nak makan
dia dah makan err then the the parents of err dia punya err apa tu adik dia punya wife masuk tau into the room
and then it was like so awkward ke tu orang tua aku tak tahu kenapa dengan orang tua but bila dia like when they entered the room aku dah tahu okay this is going to be a very sombre sedih atmosphere
it's kind of betul gang ah they were talking to my friend and then they started to cry aku dah macam ya alah aku cakap no don't cry and then after that the one thing that made me even macam tersentuh sikit lah bila bunyi apa tu
your phone ah kacau jer your phone oh your alarm okay tak apa tak apa so apa tu semantic noise so ah so okay back to my story so lepas tu ah then the the mother lah the mother said to me lah ah nama anak nasri ya
then like mm a'ah cik nama saya nasri dah okay I was feeding my friend right so after that the mum was like nak nak tahu kan anak suap anak suap err err kawan ni anak dapat pahala aku dah macam aku tak tahu apa nak buat do not know how to continue the convo
ya ya ya ya ya and then aku dah macam
ya ya it's true it's true and then aku macam and then err lepas tu err then the mother was like saying err um saya jaga err suami saya dia masuk hospital enam kali then I'm like eh kamu bual err personal story pula kat aku aku dah macam macam mana nak react ah so aku macam then I I try my best
a'ah I tried my best to stay composed lah then after that err aku pun dah macam alamak aku tak boleh kalau orang tua dah start nangis then they started to cry aku dah tak boleh aku dah macam no no no no this this cannot dia they they the both the husband and wife started to cry while talking to my friend then
I almost I am macam tak boleh I cannot embed in this kind of situation because if I'm in this kind of situation I would end up macam tersentuh ah and then automatically my air mata will mengalir you know so I was like then I was like quickly err err apa tu kasih suap then after that I just say uh
cik takpe cik saya nak kena keluar sekejap lah so I went out of the room lah then when I went out the room
and then kau tahu apa you know my mum's friend um
she cannot enter the room you know of my friend ya kiranya my my friend punya mum
mother lah kirakan ah tak boleh masuk you know inside the room because you see ah
because yang sakit tu anak dia tau so bila so she is and then she's also sakit so when she will feel sedih you know she told me personally you know like
she she try not to enter into the room because when she see her son in that condition dia akan nangis
ah yes yes yes that like she feel like macam anak dia akan pergi dulu you know so there are moments where when I come over to the place
and then aku dekat dapur and then the mum would would like tell me lah like like you know err the mum will cry you know in front of me and then the mum will say err
tu lah err takde orang lah yang dia kesian you know aku punya kawan macam dia kan sekarang pun yang jaga dia it's like the father and the maid apa the maid is actually supposed to be doing the house chore and on top of that help out mum you know
but but she has an additional job of taking care of my friend lah so macam so sometimes bila dia tak mampu to help out my friends she has to help out the mother first apa because the mother is the priority first apa
so you know at times kau orang kunyit dia mulut dia pun aku kenal pun macam minta minta minta nyawa err dia pun sometimes will say you know like err
puas hati masukkan err dalam ni lah rumah orang-orang tua atau rumah orang sakit
can you imagine saying that to your to your you know your mother when your mother listens to that you know how how broken she is when when you you talk like that but but dia yang sakit dia tak fikir perasaan mak dia so that's why the mother there are a couple of times already ah and then the mother the mother say lah macam
and then like the dad also around seventy plus also so they are like macam golongan really yang orang tua lah
so sometimes bila mak dia nangis aku pun tak tahu macam mana nak react with aku dah macam huh macam mana nak what am I going to do am I gonna do I need to bring a tissue paper or what and then I just like macam err takpe lah cik sabar lah cik cik tahan jer lah
but even the the mum also say lah macam the mum somehow I can feel like the mum macam somehow appreciate aku lah macam akan cakap apa like what you tell me like err
an outsider wouldn't do this to to this extend to help a person but the mum macam
the mum really appreciate aku ah the mum macam sometimes I think the mum dia tersentuh lah and always look look look
look out on whenever I come come over and everything sampai dia pun nak masakkan nasi rawon ah tak silap
because they dia dia orang orang boyan I think boyan ke jawa I think err jawa jawa sorry dia orang orang jawa
the parents are orang jawa so so so nasi rawon is like a big thing lah so I didn't come on the day she masak cause I was just too tired then I told my my my friend lah like macam eh aku tak dapat datang ah tolong kau hari ini sebab aku penat
so the then the mum said ah tu lah cik masak ah hari tu tapi tu lah err anak tak nas nas tak tak dapat datang I'm like sorry lah cik K I mean
honestly aku cakap dengan kau
aku kan nak balik kan in in september and october you know whenever I tell that to my friend
uh dia automatically dia akan sedih so aku dah macam tak tahu macam mana aku nak react then he he say to me lah like hey can you do macam online from here then I'm like huh how am I supposed to do online and then I mean half half of me macam kalau boleh nak tolong dia
I mean after so many years of just macam you know you know that what I mean the situation of of what you are right now macam you know feeling very lost I mean I was there last time macam kita have that conversation with beberly kan
ah yang kat mcdonald's err like I was very very lost when I was like what umur aku twenty two all the way to twenty seven can you imagine I was lost for almost five years
so so that's why I was like telling myself err when when comes to to my friend lah ya aku tak boleh tolong dia all the way but I can help him out to this extent because I tell him personally like
you know with this COVID situation it will be very hard for me to ulang balik come back because of the whole swab test err quarantine and everything I mean at the end of the day dia dia pun nak kena redha and I aku pun cakap dengan dia lah macam
you know the fact that you are somebody there are a lot of people who come to your aid when you when you need help because you think about it is just macam
he always dia dia selalu ingat yang
yang aku jer seorang yang boleh tolong dia padahal orang lain pun boleh tolong dia
then aku sudah cakap aku aku aku cakap dengan dia lah macam kenapa tak nak panggil aku punya cousin setakat cousin aku dengan kau lama apa enam tahun apa
tapi dia dia macam tak lah macam macam err then dia cakap lah yang cousin aku tak take initiative and everything
mum betul betul betul
memang membastard rabak punya
ya I mean I don't know lah err I mean err if I if I want to share you personally then kau macam
err he even ni tau that he gave a certain amount of money to me tau
and the amount is one K with dia kasih aku dia jadi macam sedekah kat aku dia cakap eh err you take lah this money to pay for your semester fees as alhamdulillah but at the end of the day at the same time aku rasa macam
kau tahu macam you are tied down to something that's why aku kalau boleh tak nak macam
I don't want to accept the money lah you know honestly in all honesty I don't want to accept the money but because um dia dah ada ni ah you know sometimes orang sakit bila dia niat kau nak kena tunaikan dah niat kan
so aku just accept graciously lah and aku and I I I feels that money to pay for my err semester fees err for my err semester lepas
ah ya it feels like an amanah you know so by the but aku pun rasa macam serba salah lah macam need doing kaus eh macam
then dia cakap tak apa tak apa just ambil aku macam alamak macam mana tu but but you see like see aku dah macam you see ah like my my my err university journey like a hamburger lah alhamdulillah I would say that macam err my urusan has been dipermudahkan lah
uh with regards to my semester fees I mean err I have contribution from my late my my late step grandfather my late uncle and then then dia juga ah apa tu contribute to my semester fees
ah rezeki so macam like I say lah like you are tied down to something lah so aku kalau boleh macam
ya and I like somewhat in debt but at the same time aku macam
macam this is my my share lah macam aku kalau boleh tak nak mungkir tau macam because
aku rasa unless you are dedicated to the person and then macam you if you are not dedicated to the person you would not help the person all the way to the extent lah I mean as I do not know of any other person who does the same thing as me I think I'm the only one lah as of now lah
mm betul
betul understood understood I faham faham
kira him selfish lah in one way or another
mm lepas tu
oh macam gitu eh

I mean in your situation now of the fact that kau macam you I mean you kau kau agak you are quite
you are in a situation you are in a difficult situation right now lah like like does your family macam help you out do do do they do they like err do they like give their their hand or shout out to you like eh do need help do they even ask you eh syaf kau okay tak

err dia tak go through apa you and your uh and your other siblings went through the hardship you know nak cari makan and everything and how your mum raise you guys up and everything
eh kau nangis ke kat situ
you haven't kau takde intention nak go onto public sector ke
masuk like teaching I don't know maybe
but untuk I aku rasa macam
err the ones yang err macam study hard apostrophe
will progress kuat juga then the ones yang err tak progress are the ones yang macam mediocre
will just fought out in society aku masih ingat err I remember you know the A three teacher that geography teacher err he
ah now when I think about him ah when I think about that statement ah about what he made at last time ah aku macam eh you mean people who are working in mcdonald's is that bad ah you you are that ah that
macam his statement ah macam ada sense of macam elitism you know macam macam macam how our err government ah macam gitu that kind of it's like the vibe right there the dia kasih ya
macam very similar to how the government macam how the government is like lah so aku fikir eh you mean apa yang people who don't do well or people who are just average in society I mean they they they they are not successful padahal aku rasa orang-orang macam ini they are more like happy
I mean of course they want more but they are err apa tu content with what they have so
to but I just mention the name but never mind it's it's a it's a acronym okay so um so before I went there in my head I always thought macam able to kan aku nak belajar kat sana then I'm like I I'm like how am I supposed to cope with the system over there and everything
so it was quite apprehensive lah in the beginning lah or when I went there but after I went there I realize that the system there is very different you know from singapore cause singapore kan pakai cambridge kan and sana they have their own system tau ah for apa tu macam for how to grade and grading and everything
and then kat sana aku perasan wah the they're very smart you know like the malaysian is super smart eh we're not talking about the one in you know we're talking about every other parts of the the country you know macam ones from sabah with the ones from johor
the ones from perak like aku dah aku I was quite shocked you know like my classmates are damn super smart
but aku realize about them is what they lack is
they are they are very err examination based kau faham kan exam yes book smart exam examination centered
so it's like they can they are they are hardcore memorizer you know their mark their marking style is macam hardcore memorizer
and of course the system over there is macam err the examination is err it's it's it's it's very straightforward ah macam uh you the question is there you just vomit out back that's how you score but then like if you wanna talk about like err those yang macam err critical thinker
is tak banyak tau kat sana
the ones yang critical thinker is surprisingly is the ones yang from singapore people like me and my class and my other class and my other classmates so we would tend to ask question yang macam critic yang macam higher thinking ah
but because our our education system is dah macam nurture us like this kan but bila when we go there dia orang think yang kita ni super on tau
so aku macam huh super on eh not really leh it's just that uh our just that our culture macam singapore culture has trained us to be like this macam and then some more you have to understand aku kat sana aku pay enam ribu eh
so every hour and every minute tu bagi aku is duit so if I don't ask the question am I not wasting my money and my dad's money
ya so so that's why that's why I feel like macam when ah so sometimes they they the malaysian kat sana pun bila dia orang tengok aku pun dia orang macam
dia orang they are quite intimidated lah even my classmate also told me ah yang the very first time they met me they she feels that I am aku sombong aku arrogant aku cakap eh serious ah
she say ah engkau macam poyo ah aku dah serious ah poyo
ah poyo then I'm like but but because the way I bring myself with aku I'm not the way I bring myself is my my my my like my my kepala would be like very up and then I will look at you like bitch I'm judging you that kind but I it's not like it's not like that it's just that I have to
put up a very hard exterior lah because you are overseas mah you're like you need to hustle apa and then then
alhamdulillah I would say that I am coping very well lah I mean during the first semester I got three point seven for my but it's during my second semester that aku drop really really bad because first I was very complacent second um
so can you imagine I was the one who did everything from scratch and then it got shared so I told myself err then I was not really focused ah like I still remember like the day before the exam baru aku nak belajar can you imagine
ya yang answer script
ah it's like a macam err I based err meaning ah I I will use the past year exam paper then I will answer the question then most of the time the the questions will will be almost the same ah like every four years is almost the same that's what my one of my friends told me lah ah who has studied in
um ah in semester three I was very low key nak mampus tau aku macam aku every question every every essay that I did I didn't really share with anyone I just kept quiet uh I even like um tak post anything about about me are preparing for exams I just was just very very low key ah
ya and then this coming semester four pun err aku hopefully lah I can get a err very good lah but all in all aku cakap dengan kau I mean
I don't know I don't know lah macam but but you see ah I I remember that time ah aku baru balik dari kedah tau nak balik err pergi tak silap ke singapore uh
then aku dah eh macam mana kau tahu then she say oh I know lah because of your accent and the way you talk
aku dah wow I'm shocked man
talk betul betul betul
eh err you she she's a teacher in a she is she is a graduate from singapore eh tak silap aku eh no no no err no she's a she's a alumni of
but her brother actually err studies in and err did err did her his master in something like that then the brother got married to a singaporean girl err so to cut the story short dia cakap dengan aku lah eh uh you kan orang melayu kenapa you tak stay kat malaysia err I think you should
err take this opportunity to work in malaysia I think you would try you will thrive very well in malaysia then you got me thinking eh apa dia cakap tu maybe there is a certain truth you know because kat sana aku perasan orang melayu wah babe privilege babe
macam privileged gila aku cakap privileged you know
yes yes yes exact bumiputera thing
yes yes betul betul betul then aku cakap lah eh but you know it's not that hard it's not that easy you know cause I am a singaporean malay then err aku cakap dengan dia lah I was very frank with her I told her err you know how kat sini kita
err macam casing kita punya bangsa kan macam tindaskan
err or we are being like extra lah kirakan not extra lah we're just being err we are we we we're looked down
tapi kat sana it's err it's bangsa dia orang yang look down kau faham kan so dia macam terbalik err macam dia err aku cakap dengan very frank ah then dia cakap ya I faham I faham tapi tapi aku rasa sana pun dia dia rakyat is not
I mean is a very hustle and bustle city lah but the expenses there is mahal nak mampus
I find like macam barang-barang dah macam barang-barang the shampoo body shower oh wah I tell you mahal sangat macam satu
one body shower macam dove eh twenty four ringgit eh siala twenty four ringgit when you pay when you pay fifty ringgit to pay for the twenty four ringgit and when you left with that balance eh macam kiwak macam eh this is very expensive leh but when in singapore
when you pay fifty dollars for the same amount of eight dollars you you have the balance is still a lot kan then it's like worth it kan padahal it's the same current it's the same rate but just different currency so honestly if you ask me whether
I always thought like macam is quite cheap aku I when I go over to like macam kedah I go penang wah it's even cheaper sia barang-barang dia then I'm like I'm quite shocked lah in one way or another
and then err I mean I always got teased off lah I always got teased yang eh err by my classmate eh kau tak nak kahwin ke dengan orang malaysia
aku macam ah kahwin orang malaysia kau tahu tak aku punya preference apa
no I'm serious I mean I I have I have this classmate she's orang johor you know so she dia macam dia macam merajuk you know dengan aku because aku macam friend zone dia
no no no that one is another girl that one is another class that one is another department err that one is err sastera that one is my my my own classmate lah and then macam macam mana aku tak friend zone dia babe dia
dia she's from okay dia not very the feminine kind of girl oh dia macam very kasar then dia suara very loud and then dia very macam err like you you can sense a presence you know and then she's very she participate in every college activities
and then aku kalau aku betul-betul nak menghala kepada
ke jalan yang lurus and then my choice of girl is somewhat very feminine you know macam honestly like ya ya ya I mean yang orang yang pakai tudung yang very very very manis to look at I don't know ah that is my kind of preference ah when it comes to
ah sia aku macam siala I mean
ah syak kurang ajar lah tak lah but I don't know I mean I don't know you never know what you never know err our future like who knows maybe kau one day get married or aku one day get married you'll never know
but but innocence that macam aku punya preference when comes to I have I have a type of of of of lady of or a girl and yang aku suka lah and my preference is macam yang putih yang dia no need no dia tak perlu putih sangat it's just putih dia pakai tudung ke very very typically uh
eh aku tak hitam kita sawo kita sawo matang kulit kita is sawo matang
sawo matang tanned tanned sawo matang
so err ya so and then kurang ajar tak lah hitam is hitam and then after that um then aku kat sana aku kan macam abang-abang aku kan macam abang-abang singapore kan
ah ya ya ya you know my suara is always like hello
and then lagi suara aku ah my my voice will bounce apa whenever I use the mic when it comes to presentation err in lecture hall
so macam I'm known as the suara abang-abang lah but then dia orang tak tahu lah they akan close all
no I'm serious ah no aku dah macam aku cakap dengan kau aku macam double lives ah kat sana you know like
in school I am like quite err the abang-abang but
ah eh babe do you know that aku that time menang err did I did I show you a picture that I aku menang err prince of the night you know for for an event
macam ah so I I won like a prom kingish punya competition
I know it sounds crazy aku pun tak sangka and I was the host emcee for the event and and the judge was my lecturer so what he he he actually chose me as the prom king err or the prince of the night aku dah huh apa ni
no because um he chose me because I was I was one of the I was ultimately I was the only one who dressed very well that night aku ah because I was wearing blazer
ah ya I was I was wearing blazer then I bought this like yellow punya macam like a macam like a apa tu belt ke apa dah apa-apa lah and then I yellow err
I think ada I pun nak tunjuk you guys ah then so I was quite shocked lah so
so like err like err like I tell you like I I feel like I'm living a double life macam kat kat sekolah aku macam very quiet quiet baik-baik but
but at the same time aku aku kan quite wild kan like you know the number of people aku met aku err make friends with babe by in instagram by in facebook I'm still making friends up to today
I mean it's called networking lah although kawan aku yang kat singapore ni tak err I have I aku tak pernah disclose anything about it to do you know even that time I post err something about me going to kedah in my instagram
wei babe dia sampai err dia he actually
then lepas tu member dah sedih eh so dia dalam keadaan sakit dia dia boleh lagi sedih and aku dah macam eh kan kau dalam keadaan sakit kau boleh fikir yang aku nak macam
babe kalau
so macam ah you don't have to tell the other like I don't have to tell my friend lah because it's my prerogative apa
ya this my acts also apa so but
so I was like telling myself oh no no tak boleh aku dah I I cannot post this kind of err this kind of post anymore because he will be triggered eh ni nama ni triggered dia triggered gila dia triggered lepas tu dia triggered lepas tu dia start questioning me lah macam kau pergi dengan siapa and everything lepas tu dia dah start
ya then dia macam sedih lah dia dah sedih and everything aku dah eh siala ni member nak sedih
engkau ah kalau you see eh if you are sakit kau tak payah fikir tau benda begini you don't even have to think about all these all you think is about your preparation to meet
siap aku cakap dengan kau ah aku pun sometimes pun macam bila dia nak macam err intimate dengan aku aku sometimes pun I tried to elak you know because
berdosa kan kau orang tu tengah sakit lepas tu engkau kau engkau macam add onto ke fill onto his desire dia memang ada desire tu kita tak menafikan everyone has desire desire
but kena control lah aku pun cakap dengan dia eh you control lah you tak boleh terlalu on sangat leh because you never know ah in any bila kau orang cakap dia tengah kita tengah buat or kita tengah intimate sekali err tuhan tarik nyawa dia ke gila
in that kind of state ke you know because it's he's in that kind of that state state and then he's like he's super sensitive I mean at the end of the day in every situation err kalau tuhan nak tarik nyawa kau people err god would just take away your nyawa lah understood I mean
I'm trying my best to just keep up with my studies kita pun lagi tiga minute correct kalau you berapa minit babe kat situ
okay so aku pun tengah trying to keep up lah with my studies I mean I'm left with just err semester five six and seven so semester seven I'll be in here in singapore doing my internship
I I as of now I have no intention to work in malaysia lah unless there is a good opportunity for me but even so err I did ask macam consulted over there lah like they say like they if you're a foreigner you are given like macam temporary contract eh
so aku tak nak ambil contract I aku rasa it is very risky to be doing contract work and then on top of that kau kena cari err rumah then on top of that kau kena settle your visa and all those shenanigans so aku cakap no no no I think I rather work in singapore so it depends on which industry I'm going to
but you see ah the thing is I aku because I'm here mah so I am not able to network as fast
as I'm over there so kalau kalau if you were there is is is it's easy for me to network and everything but I'm trying my best to like network lah and the end of the day aku pun tak sure lah what kind of err prospects I want to do
I I see myself writing for a article in a journal you know I mean it's it's an academic journal so and the um I mean that's that's the thing that aku aku don't mind doing lah but for me to do that is like I need to go into the academic
punya sector like to become I'm not necessarily become a lecturer but maybe err
err take my master and maybe I don't know take my in language and because at the end of the day err in language pun tak banyak orang yang ambil apa unless you are really passionate and interested in it lah
ah what and tails and and and then you just hope for the best lah but I'm just glad that my study punya period is going to be be done and over with very very soon
then macam ah nak masuk sekolah pun senang /malay
oh in Australia belajar macam basics like Mathematics English
err habis tu I also belajar macam
oo my most favorite ah is definitely um belajar apa ni Law because it's very interesting lah like I get to learn about you know Australian law and it's uh it's a it's a subject that you know you don't learn
dalam err Singapore punya education I mean secondary school punya subject
ya I feel I feel you macam susah nak nak part dengan family kan
eh uh the dalam sekolah you do you do macam any
ya floorball is fun I last time before I pindah to Australia I was also in a floorball team
tak fair
hopefully lah maybe you can try next year you know never know your kau punya chance kan
huh biar betul
wah I've never heard before eh I thought you only can join like you know your only your faculty punya apa tu punya wah I didn't know you can actually do that
oh um sekarang I tengah ambil apa ni interaction design so not a lot of people know about this course because like my school is like the only school yang ada this course
um basically kat dalam course ni I do macam coding dengan design it's a very
a pasal like
coding dengan design macam tak banyak orang tahu buat so
feel like it might help me in the future when I look out for jobs cause now macam um banyak benda is like about technology kan so ya I feel like this course uh actually benefit me lah in the future
ideation so macam kita belajar macam mana nak uh brainstorm ideas uh for a project and it helps us in our like design thinking
so uh for you ah you said you were in like um marine engineering right so what like what what are the the modules yang kau enjoy
I can't I can't imagine myself in that situation macam nanti</malay>if if I were to be in that situation confirm I I would panic
so susah tak macam kerja like in a like a team
then uh uh besides sekolah kan like what what do you like to do macam do you have macam other hobby ke or apa apa benda lah
ya I I know how you feel like during secondary school pastu ada apa O level abeh stress takle fikir yeah
oh during my free time I suka
uh macam uh draw I also like to err tengok apa ni
ah anime ya that's my favourite but I haven't really been doing so because takde time kan poly dalam I'm in a design course so I don't really have much time to uh do my hobbies which is kind of uh macam sedih but yeah so
actually ada banyak plan but like the thing is that I just like I'm just I'm too scared to
but um I'll probably you know I just want to like build up confidence in myself first then um maybe in uh um year two then I will start macam join like start trying out for ah I've actually picked
macam a few is err firstly is ah floorball like um aku kata tadi kan as I've mentioned uh floorball and then second was silat
and then third is dikir barat ya but
ya it is it is that's why macam I'm like a bit takut to um you know join their team because err macam dorang nya expectations like a bit high you know so I'm I'm I'm afraid like tak boleh meet dorang nya expectations
but I think right I think confirm boleh pass punya confirm
oh mesti sakit eh
then the the surgery bila
it's okay it my my my mum my mum has been through the same thing then dia dia kata like
um it's actually not that painful lah because like you know they put you in uh on sleep right so like you won't feel anything like you only feel it like once you bangun so I don't think it's that bad ya so you don't have to worry you know
and anyways it's for the better also so I think ah after if I think it's better to get like the surgery done like as soon as possible because you know you tak nak any macam side effects kan so ya
how how how would you feel like macam you know before you enter the the room like what do you think like macam like your feeling
uh I've never I've never apa ni had any surgeries before
I can't imagine the macam dia nya sakit
tak lah I never say
ya ya ya so macam during my free time cause ah
apa ni I I love doing calligraphy right so I like macam I have I have like a mini business where
I uh buat calligraphy on orang punya macam notebooks and stuff then I sell it for like um quite a reasonable price lah so it's affordable to everyone and I also like playing with colours and
uh I like aiya basically like um doing calligraphy calligraphy so ya that's why I decided to macam you know buat this business because
cause a lot of people kan you know singaporeans kan diorang suka macam study kan then banyak orang suka buat macam notebook diorang macam cantik cantik so yeah that's why I I thought like why not you know just like
decorate their their notebooks and stuff so that diorang ada macam motivation to belajar
kan sekarang COVID kan so like uh kat dalam rumah what do you do
ya ya is good because like you know now COVID like a lot of like businesses are like affected right so I think this online business thing is also macam a good way lah for orang to you know macam get that extra cash
then like after after macam COVID kan
you where's where's the first place yang you want to travel
and remember yang kita semua jatuh sakit after we played at the beach
it was actually quite funny because like everyone who swam at the the beach semua kena apa ni jatuh sakit
yeah hopefully once like macam the border dah buka then we can go
after macam this COVID situation I think the first place I want to travel to is uh mana ni Japan
I've been there bila when I was like I think five years old
I was very young so macam tak ingat uh I don't really remember a lot of things ya so that's why I wanna macam go there again and then macam like immerse in the culture and stuff
ya I I mean Japan also macam if it's like an interesting country ah macam menarik you know pasal
like because uh I told you before I'm an anime lover right so like I want to go there macam collect diorang nya apa ni figurine because like banyak orang kata macam
is macam quite cheap ah so I was like okay ah then I I think if if cause I like to collect
the the work is macam due next week kan then I would only do it like macam tiga hari before the the due date
ya because I don't know sometimes I'm just too macam penat nak buat buat the assignment so that's why I keep you know pushing back the assignment ya what about you
always use my I'm on my handphone asyik tengok Instagram semua then it's like I don't realize like the time has passed and then when it's like already ten o'clock I'm like oh dah lambat ah just tidur lah besok boleh buat
macam like group projects eh
oh recently I I ada macam this one err group project like I just finished macam err dua weeks lepas is apa it's called studio project so it's basically like because uh
so my group kita buat we did this uh macam is like a E storybook kind of thing and then we drew our own characters and macam the setting all also we we draw ourselves using Photoshop Photoshop is is a very susah app
to pakai because ya it's only my first year and then is also my macam my first time ah pakai then it's like susah ah then like all my other friends macam they are like quite experienced in it because some of them are from ya
so so for the past two weeks we've been trying to make the story macam interesting ah so like when users uh see the story then they can like
interact with the the book by clicking like macam arrows and it will lead them to it will lead them to like the next uh page or something so that's like macam there's an interaction there
Animal Crossing is a very in game now eh a lot of people have been playing it I'm also very curious macam banyak orang like semua main ah then I was I'm also like quite interested to know like what's so you know special about this game
macam look forward to ah
wah that that's quite a handful you got you got banyak project to apa ni buat
yeah it's good also because like kan year three we ada internship right I and I also heard like before you start your internship you have to actually go for an interview for um untuk like the company before diorang accept you in
I I actually I didn't know that like I thought internship like diorang we're just like straight away masukkan you inside there but I didn't know like you have to macam go through an interview so I think macam it's quite it's quite beneficial lah like apa diorang
ajar teach kat dalam yeah
I also had like a similar a similar module I did apa ni uh previously
where also same it's called uh effective effective err communication skill so diorang ajar macam mana
nak you know err if err communicate effectively and how to like you know gain uh confidence
powerful words I guess you can use during your interview so like to macam macam you like sell yourself so
ya I I actually find that module actually quite interesting ah but macam sedih ah because like it was only for a semester I wish it was longer because it really it really helped me ah from someone who is actually macam
macam takut to like you know stand in like to talk during a presentation to someone I am now who err is uh confident enough ah to present and actually ya it has really helped me in my presentation
and macam it's like quite cool lah because like then you can macam cari orang in the same course as you then after that you can make friends from there like for me err there's this macam ada this uh girl that she came up I mean she texted me then she was like eh I heard you're in the in the same course
then uh she's like uh let's be friends ah then from there uh we started being friends ah then err when during poly because err mostly it was on Zoom right because of macam this COVID situation semua so everything macam is online
ya so err ya then err in school like when we macam jumpa
face to face it was actually not bad ya we we we we acted like we we've known each other for macam many years
ya so it was like quite easy lah in terms of like making new friends yeah but I think now the only thing macam susah is that uh is like the modules ah because ya I mean like some of the modules it's like I've never macam done before
or I have no interest in and then ya like for example coding I've never done tak pernah buat coding before so yeah I I get to learn like new things and stuff
I was going to cry you know cause no orientation then you know my school got this like macam party for the for the freshman then don't have cause COVID
oh I think I think flag day is not bad to be honest it's it's just the the weather that is like you know kind of makes everything macam
macam the badge gitu so yeah so I went for the eight hours shift one ah so it's not bad ah tapi panas gila
and the and the worst thing kan towards the is tengah puasa you know tengah puasa then like me and my friend macam like eh nak batal ke nak nak batal ke tak nak batal ke tak
then we then kita almost batal lah my then my friend dah tak boleh take it kan then she was like ah batal jer lah
eight hours was uh painful lah then kita jalan jalan
ya we we we we walked around the whole of Tampines ya but it was very very rewarding pasal uh at the end of the day kita dapat banyak donation
huh biar betul
kay lah not bad you know at least you all macam you know like put money inside lah donate also
but if you were to do macam flag day again would you do it
penat I couldn't macam buka my mata
ya it was during bulan puasa
ya cause we had to stay under the sun because like a lot of the macam the tempat yang ada shade kan already dah ada orang so me and my friend like macam terpaksa ah kita stand
under the hot sun then collect lor but that spot was the best cause banyak orang lalu sana so ya so we got a lot of donations there then after that we told our other friends then they start coming then after that we were like alamak shouldn't have told them
ya true hopefully lah I I I really wish macam this COVID situation will macam die down ah because it really affects ah kita punya life
a'ah so kita kena bual bual macam untuk satu jam kena cakap like in both like melayu dengan english so boleh tak
okay maybe kita nak cakap pasal like kita punya favourite show boleh tak
oh movie apa
wait like buta like like how buta hati atau like you know
wait cause the the guy was the cause of like kenapa dia buta
tak senonoh then after that
wait tapi the guy know yang like like
the guy is dia apa tu yang punca yang the girl punya
lelaki tu wah
memang macam like I don't know like cannot like straightforward you know
ya lah but like macam it's so coincidental you know like macam the girl dengan the guy is like
kedai ya
but macam it doesn't make sense like
ya ya I think kena tengok right
your abang is my adik
I think it's kind of takde lagi is it
pasal dia ya dia orang dah remove then it's the show's about you now like scientist like geeks
and then like they they are very awkward with like perempuan you know like the girls and then like eh like macam like when I watch it I was like oh my god that's like so me you know like I like to like you know uh macam baca buku all that thing and then like won't interact with other people then lepas tu like
then lepas tu he I think dia orang ada like sepuluh seasons and then like it's all started off when they were still like young like I think like twenty years old and all that lepas tu dia orang dah besar sampai like dia orang like tiga puluh lebih and until like
and then it's like I think is it is interesting because like you actually you watch the seasons like you actually like following their life and like you know like you tengok like macam dia orang like grow to become like a better person
so macam damn cool because I also because like dulu kan macam banyak orang ingatkan like orang yang suka science semua ni dia orang semua macam apa tu ganjil like very awkward right like they feel like they macam cannot fit into the society
socially less awkward and also because like macam if you realize it's also about our life where like when you are younger you tend to feel like you cannot fit in but you don't need to change for anyone
because like I remember one episode kan like macam young sheldon is like the most awkward there's this guy nama sheldon
school like not really a professor lah by research scientists and then lepas tu like um banyak orang ingatkan dia macam tak boleh fit in
but then over the years apa dia dia dia cuba like fit in to like parties macam because ada seorang perempuan popular ni neighbour dia
kan and then like um dia like invited them like this clique of like nerds to like the party then lepas tu they will they will feeling very awkward because dia orang dia orang like cuba to interact with like the rest
ya dia orang semua ingatkan dia weird sebab like dia datang pun like dengan baju tak senonoh
until the party and cannot fit in lah but then lepas tu then he realise that oh my god
apa tu daripada dia ni kecil sebab dia ada tengok show ni daripada kecil call doctor something so it's like a show about like doing experiment like science fair then that guy become like movie star or something like that
ya so it's quite a good show like and that's not the only thing lah because like dia dia dia pun like was single all the way then lepas tu dia orang ingatkan takkan ah kahwin then ya because a lot of people think he's weird then tak he still have friends but then he realise that
he realise that um apa tu to like
like it's very awkward all the way but then they realised that sometimes right in relationship or in life you have to compromise betul tak like he cannot like
ya so they actually show us yang macam love
terus jump to it
it compared to like them right so it's like a contrast kan dia orang carry macam opposite of each other
ya so dia orang cuddle cuddle dia macam like eh let's get married today you know
and like and then like there's also another couple there then they always have like intimacy macam dia orang selalu buat benda tu then like
oh because you pakai like all the duit birthday for all this
I know you said you show me the photos mah and then macam it's damn nice what
no lah but waffle kan macam murah takkan they will charge you lah
okay but haji lane is overpriced sebab tu lah you cannot compare
ya seven dollar is is actually murah ya but it's at where somerset
that means like macam kalau they are not like at the central area of singapore kan it's usually cheaper
ya lah that's why it's cheaper lah kalau if it if it's at town right confirm mahal
what no lah but tu untuk buka like cafe in singapore quite
so you become like ibu
design the place itself kan macam they will just you just need to hire a person to do it then after that you just forget about that person you don't need to be part of the cafe
it's not it's very mahal and like ya
it's like macam you know like we we it's like our like previous kedai lor
ya it's like you need to know makanan apa sedap and then like sometimes kan you hire the chef and the dia tak tahu masak
no but actually makanan tak sedap pun tak apa tau cause like sometimes some people they just go there ya enjoy the aesthetic and like the ambience
ya the ambience of like the whole cafe and like macam it's cool lah like
you know like your makanan K cause your makanan tak sedap kan at least your coffee sedap or like you get like some unique like latte art like what you say
ya ya lah you see I love coffee you know like I can drink like coffee macam tak ada gula
ya like takde gula is like totally fine with me ya
actually I want to ask you kan macam like K this is a weird question because I just see at the prompts um if you have like tiga like wish that you wanna wanna
ya like okay like kalau tak ada macam K if like there's no boundaries because you know like macam you tengok aladdin all that right it's like you cannot kill anyone you cannot love and you can't make anyone fall for you or you cannot
okay let's make it like you cannot be because like you know it'll be more interesting because like you wish for for example like oh I wish that I have my own restaurant but it's not monetary like kan like duit apa tu apa tu it's just ya cause if you just say like I have a million dollar kan tak fun
cause like I feel like I'm macam sangat lost
there's too many like macam like direction that you can go like because you imagine kalau you stay in malaysia then like ya tak banyak ya like I think you will only get like
like kan siapa like most people will go either retail and then like or office world lah because in singapore we kita kita believe in like equality right
so that's why I like I like the so for me macam like I'm so spoilt for choice like even after working kan like I don't know whether that's the thing that I really want
even though I know it pays well like gaji besar but like you know like we we it's tiring and then like it's penat and then like you gonna remember you have to going to spend like maybe like thirty years of your life doing the same thing all over again
ya so like you have to choose you have to either choose like whether you want like flexibility or you want to choose you want money like like I don't think like you can okay lah maybe you kalau you start your own business you can be have you can have stability like in the future but at the start macam betul susah
ya bukan like the
ya cause you know like if you go jakarta like I don't know you wait did go batam ya you went batam before right and you know like macam some places are very crowded then you know they don't care one ya
they do though because that time I went national gallery then dia orang semua duduk dekat
ah dia orang semua loiter dekat you know that there's this like footpaths
ya and then he shouted it's like a way the way to national gallery then lepas tu the maids are all group like crowding there like there's like more than five people crowding
and then kena pekik sia they were like oi is you new like why
and then lepas tu the maid then after that the maid was one of them was stood out and then I was like they talk back to the person then I was like with my friend lah then I was like oh my god what's this maid doing ah
ya I tak kisah so I just like walk away and then lepas tu they were like I I don't even know what happened next but I just saw the last part was that the maid was keeping quiet
tapi like
you are just lucky cause like in singapore macam even when you are younger like they will bring you to overseas already like you have a chance to go like china ya school trips or that school overseas trip
ya so we all ya I think singapore bagi kita like money to like spend for all these trips sia so I think it's like I think that's a good thing eh
dia sounds like internship kan then I was like wah
ya macam like people from korea guam that's why
macam like banyak orang that like
than I want to focus on my career and studies rather than doing business cause like even though I think like business macam it's easy to
okay lah it's not easy it's like is feasible but some you can I can do it but like macam I don't feel like I want to pursue it cause I want something to like fall back on like a safety net
you should go with afal adik
like just you know like our family so used to like eating like those kind of like you know macam tempat
tak bersih sangat lah also it's okay ya ya they don't care one
science kau ah
kak ya you know inshira right she's working like so called full time in nurse
who's kak epah
kak malinah that one is
ya oh tapi K takpe kita boleh masa baru
oh I see semua busy
ya but I used to be sociable but then I realize like eh okay because maybe I tak I think I know why cause you tak you've not enough money
bagi set aside budget berapa like berapa duit
wah lama sia
oh you nenek say that
mahal is it
like cheese I don't understand yes ibu also don't like but ibu okay with it you know why
I setuju oh you ramen
no ask kakak to help you lah
like selamat datang ke podcast saya
ya but I don't think macam like podcast kan ada
ya but then after that radio become popular then now radio not really no but they they still are relevant because people drive listen to radio ya but then the problem is that podcast is taking over radio cause we fly it's like that's why bapa all listening to podcast now
ya I know what you mean like macam but for me right if I clean I'll be happy

I think I did but then no I think I just like rapat-rapat with him but I didn't confess ya he didn't know that but then like I apa tu
primary school I had this best friend kau tahu syadika
you know syadika she work at cotton on before but then like she we used to be so rapat you know like how dulu kia tak ada phone so we gave like letters
everytime we gaduh I will like write letter our locker is atas bawah tau so I will put the letter inside the hole
ya then after that we we we concealed even before she read the letter as after that bila dia buka
a'ah seh no but then dulu aku punya bila aku primary school to secondary school I was very like the way I text very like demanding
then when I was primary six we went on a holiday then after that I kena accident
then in the accident like I was at bali then I was going back to singapore from malaysia then after that uh the car swerved cause like something hit my dad's car dari belakang tau then after that he swerved inside the longkang
then after that he went atas balik like he swerve the car back up lah but then when he got back the car on the road was like the other side you know like how it apa tu the car cars are going this way his car was already like this side and he stop then after that four of my siblings were out of the car like tercampak keluar then when I suddenly I was in this longkang like nasib I sedar diri if not they wouldn't like find me cause I was in a very deep longkang but then my legs were all in pain so I cannot like panjat the longkang ah cause I wasn't that steep but my legs was really really in pain then I shouted for help then this guy piggyback me up cause ambulance wasn't there at that point in time so I was put inside this car then my adik was also inside that car also aiman aiman
dia pun kat dalam kereta tu then after that bila ambulance datang I was like vomiting a lot lah because like the apa itu how to say ah traumatic
no it's not trauma it's like macam if your body or your throat then macam dia force the food out
then after that I vomited a lot like a lot it was the worst I ever vomited then bila apa itu aku
ya then after that it was quite hard ah masa tu cause I'm a singaporean what then after that bila aku dah masuk the cause my tangan all sakit then I was wearing short sleeve abeh dia cakap no choice but to apa tu cut my baju then after that when I cut kan the doctor can say like it's very smelly
ya cause I keep muntah what
I keep vomiting then after that he say huh busuknya and then like I like what the hell
like dia not ya
then after that they almost like took another person like cause my bed is here then another granny's bed is here so it's like tepi-tepi tau like side by side then after that she went like the person dah already angkat the grandmother
my dad wasn't there at that point of time and then my dad was like eh this one yang pergi singapore bukan itu so the the granny almost went to singapore then the the nenek was like very confuse lah
was like what mana aku nak pergi
my dad had to angkat gini
when aku sakit dorang like like a lot of people was around then he was stitching some stuff aku tengah sakit tau then after that they keep like talking loudly
ya dah draw tau and then they wanted to cut there then after that my dad straightaway like apa tu
call singapore cakap that they want to bring me back even though like they can do the surgery there because like aku nak balik kat malaysia pun lama juga what and then like my this one wasn't growing a lot there wasn't a lot of blood clot so like I like went to singapore first without my family yang the rest kat situ then I had my surgery
ya mine is worst cause I need surgery but the second worst is my my adik
ah syami syami dari sini all terkoyak
eh sini dengan sini terkoyak but then here already got bacteria infection
so like like it's terbuka the flesh all terbuka they didn't clean the the wound properly
then after that um my mum also not happy you know malaysia right they they ask you they insist that you go to apa itu that you stay in the malaysia then they ask you for money every single time they ask you for duit every single time
uh they ask for duit everytime then you know even my my adik want to wants to go back to singapore cause my mum already dah already going to inside ambulance you know the nurse have the audacity to say my mother that he cannot bring the baju that he was wearing cause that is hospital punya baju
then then dia cakap if you want to bring you have to pay tengah sakit-sakit baru nak gi singapore then you say that
and then after that my uh aunty cause my aunty from bangi went down cause dorang nak tolong like cause a lot of family members takkan nak my dad my father jer nak handle everyone then after that uh dia cakap dah like she shove the money inside on the nurse space
like nah ni duit kau you want right you want so much you go take
exactly then after after that ya even the johor one was like that then then the johor you know how you like if you are patient you need to put insert that thing inside baru aku cannot feel right
this one you know what they ask you to do they ask me to pay you know like um macam how to say ah tube
ya then I balik kat singapore then singapore was very fast I'm not being biased but was super fast like then I went to surgery then after that I was in I I I went unconscious for like one hour two hour it wasn't long ah it's not coma or what
after that what ah oh ya then dekat hospital there all my siblings went to singapore also what then cause that time was I was in primary six
is like I think the height only tukar
bodoh lah
ya ah and there's one I saw like international school like orang putih
their school pun their atas eh their top was plain plaid blue it was very very nice then the guy wore the plaid type
sakit ah mata
hmm ya lah you can kau tak amazed dengan senior jer kan
aku I didn't pandang seniors at all
cause most them actually thought I cina so I like okay and I didn't hang out with you guys much what
not but it's not really confessing lah it's pasal she took away my friend or like my friend lie to me
sec eh eh sorry sorry primary five primary six sec five eh primary five primary six apa tu uh I had this friend nama dia alia
um she live near here also sometimes I see her but she looks the same anyways ya then I was very rapat with her lah I thought it was like we we will be best friends that kind of thing and then after that this amira came into the story then when amira came dorang started to be rapat then at first I was okay lah then we can all rapat together what then I tell her like you know we have this stay back during holidays for primary six
ya then after that ah I told her eh jom lah balik together since we live near cause we used to live that neighbourhood last time
after that we tell her I told her jom ah uh like balik together then after that she like okay then I went to my locker and then when I go back eh dia tak ada

but she damn rich she live kat atas jurong point
no but their house legit lawa gila
like you know like how the loft story the condo but theirs like level one then after that there's a balcony you masuk
ya then then their house is like when I went to it was so lawa like you know like rich kid then after that she wore like this this like apa tu jubah butterfly jubah
ya cause that time we went during raya what
then after that she also satu hal ah I think she don't like me also then she
her mum pakai tudung I think she is religious
disappointed she she ah dia pun ada adik the adik I think now secondary school still
me uh um buka cerita this one I had
cute ah dia dulu
shut up diam ya every morning
then after that um then after that he confess his feelings that's like okay ah I I mean can just okay then we keluar together
and then after that like I'm when I was relationship with him right I didn't felt like myself like I even like cause that time I was ready like after after uh secondary school then I during secondary school cause I wasn't wearing hijab fully what
then after that after secondary school I wanted to like legit wear hijab and not let guys see see my hair but then like he says that it's okay to see my hair
haikal now with another girl that time kat paya paya lebar kita nampak dia pe
siapa no she don't he don't have chinese girlfriend
with izzat I didn't even think about it at all but when we started obviously but when I was with afiq like he really like he really I mean about the bare necessities he really respected me like he didn't insist on like nak tengok rambut pay more runway or something the whole time he that one
is the ya but it's very apa oh ya ya but it's very rare to find cause all my exes like that one they don't care that kind of thing
then like dia kerja kat cafe
ya and dia kerja cafe sekarang actually I want to no but then it was very like he didn't even pandang orang bertudung
legit his friends know that about him and then he out of all his friends he he's the one who don't date much and then like ya and then he used to very mean before he met me like let's say he has a strong opinion again he will just blurt it out like and then if I even if you are good mates with him right he will just like straightforward say oh you're not doing your shit better do your shit now that kind of thing like but after he met me he became like better lah like he don't straightforward say because he try to jaga my hati at first he don't know how to jaga hati perempuan then I was like at first I was annoyed you know that one month when I started talking to him I actually wanted to stop talking to him you know
because I know then he will have like a strong opinion with it I started out slow then sometimes obviously I become mad then I tell him I mad at you he's like kenapa marah I was like I don't know you figure out yourself then he's like like it's the first time someone tell him that to him like then after that I think from there he start to take care of feelings more even his friends cakap that there is banyak difference from him dulu and sekarang ya which is good lah then after that from that like eh this guy is different like really really different from my exes
kau what about your exes
I think she want to elak I think she want to elak like to touch each other cause it's haram to do so
mira filzah the type kuat agama type what
dia ada cakap what the interview
I think mira like more of agama more than that type of stuff
like he made fun like cause there was this girl she's not wearing hijab but he can like sengaja see the sepender
after that he just say eh apa awak curi my sepender eh selama ni saya cari-cari tak dapat then everyone like ya I was so shock also cause like
does she have a boyfriend dia ada boyfriend

is that why you tertidur in the bus
I don't like bus sebab every time I take bus I feel like I senang get lost

dekat opposite this sia dulu here our old house that time habis sekarang kat sini ya the bus masuk like around here I got lost trying to get back to our old house macam budak bodoh saya
I have I I mean like dulu ingat sikit lah macam nak jalan pergi library ke pe

they always yishun tempat dodgy
actually yishun got quite a lot of places like kalau compare dengan tempat lain it has ada juga mix dia
like twenty four hour places tempat nak pergi like play bowling got rock climbing also right
the place you stay at lawn rasa tu ya nope I don't think so
tu jer I want see more
I always I always want to go tapi macam
ya alasan jer
but you vomit tapi cakap fun ah
I tak tahu whether where eczema affects my blood or not I hope it doesn't but like
ada chance

dia orang main try try jer
just poke and biar berdarah lah
I feel I am scared sia if you if you vein rupture sama benda dengan dia orang poke salah ke
seram sia
oh shit saya terbaring
kenapa jadi gemuk sia
I don't know bro kita mana pernah belajar benda ni semua
right now sampai sekarang
I think isn't the lobang at your vein maybe ya
I might uh might try to donate my blood bila bila ada lagi ah
you go yang kat mana
oh oh kat situ
leceh ah nak belajar dekat luar tapi all the seats all cannot they don't allow us to sit
kat mana seh
err di ada orang belajar I think telcom ada orang belajar err airport also ada orang belajar seh
eh I wanna buy some stuff from Shopee but I I know like I don't have duit now but like just
a little bit cause I got something that I really need right now so macam uh kinda need like a proper charger yang tak rosak
I mean you can check the review what ada yang not bad pe
I want to buy a lasting filer sebab yang filer kita ada always so soft then like a few use then dah tak boleh pakai lagi
that's it's easier but like dia macam satisfying juga ah nak tengok
macam mana dress dia
I think it was me I liked it but like pendek sangat ah I don't like when my legs are like too exposed
kira nak tutup sikit lah but like like I don't like it when the dress is like above my lutut
uh I don't know I just nak try dulu sebab I feel like silver necklace macam tak kena sangat because
lagi lawa and fitting as a necklace then silver but like with other jewelry macam earring and rings
feel like silver lagi lawa
I hope like when school start next sem dia dah buka balik and like kita boleh balik sekolah because I cannot tahan anymore
my become so rabak sia
just in case bro the four pointer in my school drop tier like this sem he got like two point nine sia dia boleh drop sampai three point six from a four pointer
kesian seh
oh yay can to school then I can tidur I can tidur in the car yay
keluarkan kereta sendiri ah
huh serious ah dia cakap gitu
motor convenient tapi but nak bayar a bit ya ya ya
as seen from my friends dia orang
I would go for motor lesen but like ada satu motor ni saya selalu nampak dia black it's like black
it's Yamaha but I still don't know what model it is tapi it's so pretty
tak boleh ya
then like you spend money on it tapi tak pakai
oh ya yang electric punya
then owning kereta sendiri
habis nak spend lagi
wow wow dah kaya
I told you I already bilang you that I'm not good at it what
I just don't like it sebab nanti kadang dia rasa melekit tu
sebab macam campur dengan peluh ugh cause I always put it like in that in between joints
tak suka sangat ah
I actually don't mind it sia sebab it stop me from garuk
can don't pemalas or not
tapi kalau dah ada why would I buy mah
err rarely sebab sekarang tengah pakai mask so like I don't see the sun why would I wear
right see it's a two way thing not bukan I saja pe
I think is their like new collection ke apa
I have never ada interest in wallets I feel like asalkan it can hold my cards and my money
um baik ah kau
kau eh
kan ah itu susah
ada pekik kan a'ah
um kat sekolah selalu kena check in check out temperature taking semua
tak suka ah
nak minum air pun susah kena keluarkan mask semua
macam lek bro lek bro cuma nak minum air
a'ah kena kena nak kena sepak muka
oh oh did I tell you about kat sekolah kat sekolah kan got this girl dia macam irritating gila babi tak tahu
a'ah dia macam bites off macam gitu you know
dia macam tengok aku macam stare stare macam gitu
tak ada tapi like I I cakap dengan dia like tapi her vibes macam really off lah like dia macam suspicious dia macam cakap dengan aku like one way then she will go out and then she will talk to someone else another way
okay tapi kan like
I felt very petty lah tapi like um what's another like do you have any like macam petty reason
you like don't like somebody even though like macam
just met ke atau
macam Tinder ke muslim match ke
but it makes sense because macam like if you going to get to know that person
and then they they are like the way their vibes macam tak link dengan kau so it's very weird of course of course you would say no
kau gen Z
ya semua semua online
like orang can find like what they need to know about you through online social media semua tu
if you going to use normal you going to use a different name itu kan catfish
okay kau betul kau betul
kalau age lain sikit macam um please remove remove ah kan I mean as long as you're over twenty one so it's
macam mana okay ya paedophiles out of the way
technically it's a podcast cerita malam punya podcast kan
ya I guess that's like a pet peeve kan macam orang like lie about their age basically they fake their personality
ini what pet story ke apa buat pet story
huh makan um
makan Maggi bro a'ah
ya ya lah I lead the simple life senang sangat pe
aku makan mee gorengnya tak it's the
tak it's the Myojo one Myojo brand um ya
oh did you hear ada restaurant baru kat bawah karma
tak tau ah
oh alamak alamak kesian
macam perangai perangai dah change ah macam gitu
alamak so sweet nya
alah macam gitu pun boleh alah
kenapa monyet monkey lah
dia kepoh ah jer
I know lah tapi macam third party terdengar
that's mean tak baik sia
alright makes sense it's okay you want clarification just as in secondary school sekolah menengah
who are like there to like support you kan so macam like if you if you find like friends who are girls then macam they just want to like
befriend you so they can get to know like your best friend or something like that tu salah macam salah sikit
but I think like like the karma that's going to be served to me but kalau
tapi kan if like if like karma were to like be served to me I think it will be like
dia cakap dengan aku like uh the way I
break up with people macam traumatising sikit
dia cakap macam sikit jer lah tapi
like revenge lucky revenge kan macam
oh okay for siapa
I will give karma back to him sia like macam
oh macam like he will say oh girls like perempuan tak boleh buat ni pe kena ada lelaki semua
ah ah ah ya ya ya macam gitu macam gitu tapi kan like I'm I feel macam
macam like you got nothing to prove
aku rasa because right I realise
if macam like
like some guys kan macam them they try to over like try to be overconfident
no because kan like kalau dorang macam like they get into a relationship with you then dia rasa macam okay
subconsciously dorang macam project their insecurities on to you
um does it's like whatever they are lacking then dorang macam insecure gila babi then they like ah macam mana I cannot
um tapi like confidence is good like in a person tapi macam tapi kan if you're like too overconfident then you are just macam hiding something then it should it like you're hiding something to the extent where you are actually projecting your insecurities on other people so please get therapy
please get therapy ya please get help because macam I macam I don't like the fact that macam some guys ada
because dorang macam live so macam insecure because of like maybe what somebody else cakap dengan them or like something that somebody criticise them or whatever and then suddenly they are like insecure for their entire life and then they like project it on to you and then now suddenly using that and then fuelling that anger and then they are like I'm angry at you because somebody said that I'm not tall enough something like that kan a'ah
I I I I will agree lah women are the same but I feel like macam like perempuan semua we are so like in tune with our own emotions then especially we will like in like a group of girls and then we're like very comfortable with each other which kita boleh blush out berbual banyak-banyak we can talk like this end to the other end like how we're doing in this conversation
macam podcast sia tak tau
I'm edgy I'm cool I'm so quiet oh my god macam sounds like me
um okay alah kesiannya oh no
even if you are just friends ke atau macam mata air semua you don't own anybody
macam overly clingy
to get kan duit susah
I just macam
kat padang padang killer yes oh it's farm

um probably macam I'll talk about my
two elders so gizmo's one of them and then like precious is the other one ya I feel like she will be low key macam
hidung tinggi a bit sombong sikit because she's very pretty she's very pretty
ya but tapi right I think she will be the macam queen bee very pretty tapi dia very macam
oh banyak sia
I got four other cats eh macam mana

you need to train them macam really train them because macam kalau for cats kan like they can be a certain way kat rumah
but but sometimes macam you go to the vet clinic then they macam ganas ke they like to scratch around is normal lah because they're not comfortable mah tapi kalau dia kat rumah they're very comfortable they're very loving macam is so easy for them to like
they're not like dogs dogs kan you need to macam train them properly like okay here is where sit or like here is where you poop pee whatever

hey sorry I know I came I'm supposed to come like an hour earlier but I came timing gini
yeah tapi like luckily I got like direct bus ah I mean it's a long bus ride but it was a nice long bus rides
yeah macam
like forty minutes then like I was thinking to myself like shall I take a train or what then macam like
suprisingly ada eh cause macam like apa
newton or something then I have to keep like tukar tukar actually no like last year I at dhoby right and like my line is the green line then I have to keep like switching and stuff
yeah I feel like I mean like I understand that we have to wear the mask and stuff tapi like
macam so leceh you know like I'm still so
yeah I was supposed to go for like two concerts this year you know I was supposed to go for yungblud and rex orange county tapi like COVID
mm begitu lah nak buat apa kan
apparently like supposedly my ah first ah music festival lah kirakan so macam like excited kan
habis COVID habis like pun tak boleh masuk I really miss you know I want to go like
you know makan sate malam malam
murah and it's like so nice to
then like she sell err she her husband sold those like bakso cuts you know
and because of COVID cafe dah tutup seh then macam like we feel very bad because it's like
she's kind of like she lives in a kampung right then she just like gave birth and then like
tak ada duit like the only source of income was like
from her husband then macam like baby tak ada duit then the other time
we called her during raya the baby tengah demam seh
like mum's siblings and stuff cause we like kita like very rapat dengan dia
bila raya right like dia orang tak boleh keluar negeri you know like I mean
if they live in you have to stay in then after that like you like for raya you cannot balik kampung which is like
their bandar is right so like their family members are all back in like kampungs and stuff
yeah that's not the case but I think I mean like I think it's also just because uh during like hari raya like that time
like try to leave by car right and then like there were like the police or something that dress up like pocong just for them to go home
yeah like you know the police or some volunteers lah you know macam they dress up macam pocong gitu habis just to like
scare cause like malam malam kan dekat
dekat hutan semua tu so macam like it scared them and then like
patah balik sia I got see a video of it it was kind of funny
I think they did tried to do the same kat indonesia also during like the whole lock down thing but then
why I mean like yeah I mean like I think in singapore it's not too bad like compared to like maybe in the west gitu
it's all pakai laptop eh
like you pakai laptop then like it's just what like
sometimes when I'm doing my work and she's just my mum's always at home just like kenapa tak buat
you know like kenapa tak buat
err tak tak tak tolong mak or something like that you know so I'm just like
I told you kan like the day before I pergi err the malayan council
then err you know portion dia orang kan besar kan so like I couldn't finish it so I brought home
like you know I cannot finish and I don't want to throw it away because like mahal kan
then uh he's like okay so I just met him and then like kita lepak
sekejap I got screened by an officer at like that hour I thought like I also like to panjat you know cause like
also then after that like at night I went to like jumpa kawan you know just to lepak also
I don't know there's this thing called the the rendang daging salai or something
it taste like you know the kuah is sort of like rendang then with linguine with like scallops
sotong and then there's like daging salai on top lah which is like I don't know
really sedap lah it's like a taste of like you know you I feel like a lot of fusion foods don't really work out tapi for them is like for western and malay food to work it's like
yeah I mean like I'm not sure about rendang being the nicest but
tak sedap you know everything is sedap
no I mean like I I'm fine with it but if it's like a weekday cause macam like tak ramai orang
so macam especially with the whole COVID thing I pun like a bit paranoid you know there's like so many people
cause like I don't mind like paying for that price cause like it's sedap you know and then like
pre pre COVID lah they like to give us like free stuff like for example like free cake or like sometimes they give free mussels gitu
I mean it is arab street lah everything there is like mahal and yeah it's a once in a while thing so
ayam madura which is like oh yeah
ayam geprek you know something like that like very indonesian based
but it's just a bit leceh cause like arab street and some of like it's in the middle of the road
I don't know I use you know like kat Telegram they have those macam groups kan then macam
you know they mention things like for example like oh they never mentioned the pay like berapa or just like
oh you have to go through this course first and we won't pay you for it and stuff and then macam like
benda gini all should be like you know when you advertise it should like it should be there what
habis dia orang tak ni so I was just like
yeah and then it's like macam cause like sometimes like
at least tak payah you know terfikir fikir you know kalau dapat ke tak
don't tell you the full truth then macam like I feel so cheated by it if I'm being honest
akan lama gini you know
cause like I thought like when it first came to singapore I'm like okay lah macam
but I thought like okay lah like lama lama pun maybe by the end of august or something but look it's september and it's still the same thing
and at most apa apa boleh makan kat luar jer tapi still need to wear mask and then like I'm just like
so that stupid idiot of a president cakap kan like
like the president cakap lah and then the next day
really ada orang ni seh like actually drank bleach and stuff
mm tapi macam like a bit
that this like donald trump like macam dia punya priorities is just not
which was so bad cause like you know like it was already tengah COVID
so I feel so macam kasihan for them lah that they have such a bad president like this
common at all you know like so kasihan huh
hey that's not bad I mean like no offence lah but for an average melayu you know it's
okay lah like you know you cannot expect much from orang melayu lah honestly sorry but yeah
you know reciprocate also it's a bit like sakit hati
kau tahu macam boring seh like
cakap lah benda interesting you know I received a joke once like
cinta like I that time like during I was on like dating apps like
like it's always the girl that has to like initiate dulu ah
habis like macam for a girl I don't know how it works but I believe
from the second you match ada like
dua puluh empat jam for you to uh respond then like
no I think it's macam like concept baru because macam like typically it's always like the guys that have to like
like wipey mat melayu sort of things like you'll actually find like
so macam
err there's I find more like foreigners there and stuff tapi now I don't know lah I mean like cause
cause like Din Tai Fung sana kan halal right so like I want to give it a try but like
never got the chance to like I normally every year always naik like with my family
it just became like an unknown tradition then this year tak dapat pergi it feels so weird you know cause like
normally when I go to I get very like jelak because it's like there's not really much to do besides like you know chill
tapi like
this year tak dapat pergi it's just like I want to go back
I thought halal tapi tak halal then after that I tried in malaysia and like I'm just like I'm so in love I can't believe this is not halal in singapore
but I was from a wedding tu I like
I came in like my kebaya so it's kind of funny but then at the same time like I think it's kind of normal
me and my cousins all nak cabut because like
cousins so it's like rapat but
not very rapat
going for like jemputans and stuff like that pasal macam like when growing up gitu
macam I don't know I'm like very rimas cause macam panas kan then you have to like dress up semua and then like
pergi ah wedding tapi tak kenal siapa you know then macam I
told my parents I said like yeah I'm not going to go anymore tapi I do enjoy if it's like
then you talking about the biryani like I think it's always a star of the show right then um
satu kali that time uh my my aunt I think
just I just decided to go lah because like macam I was I I know her what
then she kahwin
the biryani was just like next level
so like tak payah makan for the rest of the day
and then like sometimes they always like kasi kita bawa balik then like got the ayam masak merah then the nasi minyak and all that
okay okay nasi biryani would be the first one I think of then next will probably be like nasi minyak
then like rendang and ayam masak merah that is like the three I mean that's like the staples I mean then maybe like
like from ah um you know ikan tiga rasa like you know the crispy fish and stuff like that
other than that I feel like what else is not like why wouldn't there be biryani and stuff like that's so weird
who like got married like during like the second week of raya and I feel like
you know it's your wedding right go ahead but I very pantang you know cause I feel like I'm from a
then like to have a wedding macam like no offence ah tapi macam like spoil seh
then might as well don't do a big wedding right just kahwin like or something you know
I mean like why why do people do it buat penat jer cause like normally like
people are just more tired during ramadhan you know and then like
kejar maghrib and stuff like that just to eat with their family then like you know there's terawih and stuff like that I think this
ah tapi I
ah I think recently they uh naikkan to maybe I think fifty
I I mean like the idea of it being small it's like okay I get it you know like small wedding then macam bigger honeymoon lah kirakan tapi macam
I'm also like the first child right so macam I feel like I understand my parents point macam dia nak you know show us off or something
and then also like personally I feel like I have a lot of friends too and I feel like you know kalau tak
invite satu like if I invite like sikit sikit tu I don't want like dia orang sakit hati ke apa
tengok lah macam mana if anything also just like kahwin sikit sikit then like you know like
you know so macam like a lot of like the kampung kampung roots are still in within my family
so macam like a lot of things I do is still very traditional like personally I would still want that whole
you know macam gantry thing like you know you have to like fight your way to get in to see the bride and then like the whole
silat thing I think I I it's just for traditional purposes you know but then like
if I were to get married in future you know it's like I pengantin apa like it's like I will be pengantin once in my life only what so macam like
actually I don't want to I don't want do it under the block though cause personally I just feel like panas cause like
like you can still house like a lot of people and stuff and also like I'm pretty sure there's a playground nearby so like budak kecil all can like run around
first daughter you know I mean like this sounds super geli and it's so merepek cause like considering I'm only like ninety right but like
you know macam like considering like the financial and stuff like that like is it like worth
I thought about it like australia is a bit too near I mean like it's not to near it's more of like dah banyak
singaporeans there's banyak asians then like you know the whole like kiasu thing going on
so I think to myself just like you know okay lah then mat salleh at least I know I got chance to be the top right tapi like
dengan asians maybe not you know so I I've always thought like maybe I want to
nak migrate like like you said lah with the whole like tradition
uh like you know it's like very like new like you dah biasa with the whole family gathering then I thought about it like
like I've also been called like celup lah like back in secondary school like I couldn't do malay at all you know
she wants to pass down her malay down because she said I don't trust you dengan your melayu
gitu but I feel like if I think about it if I ever get married to a malay guy he like one requirement is that he has to speak better malay than I am because I
no lah I feel like it's also important cause macam like it's just like your self identity juga apa then like
I feel like at least in singapore also macam like the malay community is like
rapidly macam the language is dying you know I feel like
personally because macam like okay lah like if you were to
make me like you know sit in a malay class in malay in bahasa err in malaysia or something I feel like even the top scorer of my malay class
it's just different lah macam like melayu sini the standard macam lower you know then macam a lot of people like just
dah tak tahu pakai like they don't really speak
then also macam like some of them like don't even know how to cakap you know
so yeah lah then like macam a lot of like little like ah traditional things are like dying too
like macam like anyam ketupat you know macam like
my family ah bila raya we still make it a thing lah macam every year we still do it you know and it's like
sedih ah because it's like you know I grew up with such like memorable err like memory ah you know with a lot of like memorable stuff from the first day of raya and I feel like for me
holidays just like I mean like hari raya and all like becomes like less enjoyable I always enjoy getting ready you know like
the whole you know buat kuih raya and like ayam ketupat and like just like getting already getting the house like raya ready
macam best ah like you know but like
then ya then anisa pun
I come late also lah cause dia kata dia nak datang pukul tujuh eh tak tak tak dia di
rumah pukul tujuh setengah then sampai pukul
lapan setengah begitu then the end she said because err
a'ah memang jauh
dia tinggal lagi jauh dari niza
why she comes to why she is coming to school cause she got itu
hari ini dia ada photoshoot
who is the vice head menarik ah
eh dia orang nak start recruiting untuk itu
ya but is it some ad hoc tak ada heats
sampai dua-dua sekali seh
that's quite funny though like once terus dah
sad I think next next sem kita set out account ah
macam kan I don't know how it works but maybe ada profile serious how is it
one hour one hour terus dah dapat
I tak perlu upload gambar sendiri
then what if like the person dah kahwin then lepas tu ada masih orang nak try hit on the person
menarik oh god
oh it's like didn't see lah cause like your apa tak nampak apa-apa pun kan
eh then you know the Instagram what's that filter where they have their halal meter or haram meter thingy
oh cause like someone told me one of these dating apps they have this halal haram ratio or something
we have been wanting to do it just for the loves ke
to go but then I always feel bad because you like you say orang kat Muzmatch macam dia orang serious
ya it does oh ya about apa yang you said
how do you feel about that isn't that like a dating app but then macam physical
kan kan tak macam kalau dekat
kalau physical physically macam desperate tapi kalau dalam dating app tak desperate ke
apa-apa lah nak buat apa-apa apa lah apa korang lah
oh so much sia on topic ini
paint tengah picnic oh my god that is so cute
ya oh my god then like the apa
but then macam kalau the date doesn't go well I will be like bye I don't really want to share this sunset with you
oh then I will stand up lah try my best to stand up to him then like if macam
dia tak kisah pun like he is so obnoxious and so full of himself then I won't even bother lah I will just walk away
wait apa tu catfish
nineteen and this boy sudah gatal
I think I do cerita pasal dating apps or dating
wait cerita netflix oh
dating dating semua
oh kan apa ada some cerita-cerita cinta pasal
where the parents just like apa pair them pair their children up then like they their children won't know each other and and don't see each other until like the day before the engagement or something
macam dia orang beli under the fiancee skim thing cepat kan then when I see it I was like ah
nah ah just say they macam I wouldn't want I know that through all these apa
bodoh apa-apa apa-apa sebab oh multiculturalism at its best
then I saw one uh caption uh bukan caption ah macam post
dia cakap pasal the politics then I think it was about this
uh like it's so sad macam because of all this kind of things it's just some disagreements
uh kadang dia orang tak sedar diri tau
macam sedih lah macam what can you do also
tak kadang dia orang akan suddenly berbual pasal the privilege that we have for example the Mendaki thing and the education stuff
mm kenapa orang chinese tak percaya ah macam
ya kan orang-orang chinese tak faham lah
then lepas tu dia orang kata apa
hidup dalam susah hati ini dalam negara ini
ya that's the thing like everybody keep telling me like apa macam eh kita orang sepatutnya macam bersyukur lah sebab
kita orang tinggal dekat singapore singapore bagus ada orang jaga ada orang kasi kita orang solat ya ke dia orang kasi kita pakai tudung dia orang tak we don't die just because we are muslims they we don't get shoot just because we are muslims
entah lah
kelakar eh tadi berbual pasal dating abeh tak pasal-pasal berbual pasal politics pula
it's just so campur up
ah tak nak
I always stop dekat second around
macam banyaknya rajin budak ni kuasanya rebutan
oh then kita orang sama lah tak tahu lah kalau this time dia orang akan
um accept ke tak we shall see
a'ah that's why like I thought we hari ini nak keluar
nak nak meet up with my friends then
furama kat mana
tengok lah
ha siapa seh manusia
zebra zebra kecil
tak tahu I don't don't really understand your range no
a'ah dia suka tidur
tu dia purr
I want to go to safari yang dekat africa
atau dekat sri lanka pun ada ada
uh sangkar
uh sangkar sangkar
eh terima kasih lah
bukan safari safari betul
dia makan untuk apa jia jia tu lah
maybe he ya don't kind of pregnant begitu he buat to rasa something like that
best nya hidup dia orang
ya but now but my apa algorithm is more of ya human babies and cats
ya no but actually banyak seh macam
tak tak hendak tak apa lah just get over eat I just get over eat
other house on TikTok and stuff and they've been doing macam ni
mm mungkin dia orang pun macam nak
ah tapi ada satu macam
macam quite I don't I don't really like it like they have this challenge on their on their house opening I was like
entah macam ada beberapa challenge
oh tak there is one challenge that I like
is was like um calling my um my girlfriend or wife a third name lah I think that's quite cute actually I like that one but some other challenge macam questionable
tak tak she doesn't follow me anymore yeah tak nak kecoh sia
and then his pelamin is so pretty I love it
kat luar some function hall or something then my friend went to his wedding then I kaypoh kaypoh tanya dia kat mana
takde any spaces for children then like they will just run around and like that then orang akan marah and plus like it's a safety hazard for them because like there are food around hot things around and there are just so many people and so many tables around it's not safe for them so I thought
right if I were to have a children corner you won't see the bride on the pelamin ah you'll see the bride
dengan dress dia lagi
oh my god I was thinking of that tetapi kan tetapi eh tapi kan macam singapore's weather doesn't really allow us to do that
that macam abeh tengok sunset kalau sunset dia lawa oof lagi best then kita boleh tengok sunset sama-sama
like the whole family tengok sama-sama
then macam at the same time I'm scared like hujan tempias even if there's like shelter ya and confirm mahal seh ya would you want to spend so much
like I want a small majlis jer
tapi nanti orang sedih nanti macam baiklah
like I really hope if I end up getting married macam the

hmm sedar pun diri kau
it's like where do the macam foreigners who come to singapore like like why they not as hot as the ones in their own country
sana dia punya street fashion aku tengok habis dia punya models all
tapi tapi aku pernah try
I feel like if they open up other outlets in other allocations confirm lagi laku because it's cheap what but I still remember the one yang aku pergi dekat down town east punya the staff there really really rude
no no the old one that time aku gi makan it was around eight with my kawan then they be like oh we are closing already faster what you want
aku macam I just wanted my food and the they were like macam give half like like half effort

that's why I cannot wait until aku dah dapat kerja full time
gi mampus ah if it's one point eight K per month or whatever asal kan aku ada tempat just for myself
but that is the market price for all of places nowadays kan sebab kalau if you think about it kan
kalau aku nak macam pinjam for just to move on and move into a common room
that's why ah as long as okay I only move out and find my own apartment if aku dapat at least four point five to five K a month
aku just hoping aku aku masuk physical therapy at least aku boleh

cleaning the house aku don't mind tapi part nak kena macam kau tau like could you please if he pernah asked me you know could you please help me clean the ceiling of the balcony
and he made me clean it then I was like you're lucky because I'm staying for free kalau aku kena bayar dah that one you can do yourself one
benda macam like the weirdest stuff he will ask me to do

eh alah nanti dengar I will say this after the recording ends
once again you pasang your earpiece what ah
ya aku rasa kalau kau ada if you have if you had one superpower I think so it will be will be the world will be fuck because like
imagine kau kau marah kat aku tapi kau tak puas lepas tu seluruh singapore
tapi kau kat dekat sana kau tak puas so instead you go for the whole singapore
and lina pula be like why you doing this who will kill me
apa eh
or go to search go search naruto punya macam you know wikipedia you know got naruto punya
aku that's why aku no it only show I'm fucking tired
jap aku nak adjust aku punya
the doctor said that because I went to check out from my eyes what the doctor cakap tau apa is because aku rabun too much then the skin is lose then the muscle is weak so what I have to do is
rendang kenapa seh
tapi kalau you makan rendang selalu like wouldn't you get like too sick of it
like kalau for me kalau I makan rendang hari hari or like
it's like jelak seh
tapi I don't like I don't like to makan
to me kalau nak makan rendang kan
just makan dengan ketupat je
I don't like serunding
no lah I don't like serunding
okay with rendang but I don't like serunding
wah if I can only eat one dish for the rest of my life I rasa kan
a bit a bit susah leh
I think ayam lemak cili api
ayam lemak cili api or kari ayam
kari ayam hm
kari ayam kari ayam if my mom masak
because because right wah her kari ayam is
kari ayam power gila babe is power gila like dia punya pedas is just nice abih makan dengan sambal belacan then
dengan nasi oof
power gila ah
I think the idea of curry noodles is bad like imagine you lemak letak cili api and then you letak
mee mee dalam ee like
lemak cili api other than that what what do you want to eat
dia punya tarik abih dia punya daging dia punya lah soft punya lah
banyak you know dorang bagi banyak abih dorang punya soup pun like sendu gila is it sendu
macam oof macam sedap like
no macam
thick is it thick like tebal
pekat ah pekat
sendu is it sendu or seru
what is the most pettiest reason that you macam
satu orang buat kan like like kalau dorang buat then you macam tak suka
macam you don't like ah like like it's like you're petty like you really macam nak tempeleng gitu
I think right for me right wah I don't like kalau kalau dorang gedik
kalau perempuan oh my god kalau kalau like any if I see this minah eh this girl come up to me macam
cakap like
eh punya lah ee macam nak
macam nak lempang je seh
like I want to hit her I want to like ee like ee can you not be so gedik a not
and then another thing is like kalau dorang macam
like dorang macam step step
dorang macam world lah world lah macam
macam world lah
like dorang macam they're like
ah ah ah macam dorang bebual terus macam eh aku aku like aku pernah seh pergi kat sini pernah seh do this do that macam like
oh I got like hit up by girls at this club you know macam
ah macam macam big macam world ah world haprak gitu ah
cuba try cuba try
oh macam dia macam like oh like like ah ape tu
macam like I'm better than you tapi actually tak lah tak lah better sangat
macam I more better but then actually you not that better lah
kita party lah sia
I think kita
kau tak payah kerja kalau we don't have to work right
what do we do I rasa we enjoy
kita party
kita macam buat hal masing masing I think we will achieve our dreams ah
I think that is for sure macam
bill bill yang nak bayar ni semua
kalau we don't have to work then don't basically macam
the only reason why we work is nak dapat duit kan
buat hal masing masing ah
we achieved our dreams like we macam finally enjoy life why what what I would say
tak ada makna ah gitu
macam tak ada makna meaningless lah
tak ada challenges ah
basically time lah I think yang the most issue for my
ya but the thing is to me then then again age is subjective what people think that twenty four is like oh nothing but to me I rasa macam twenty four is like oh my god I don't have time anymore you know I have like six more years until thirty and then what am I supposed to do next I mean I kena kahwin kena beli rumah
to me the only factor that I rasa that I'm losing right that I'm risking is
failures and time because I don't think that I have the time to macam
ya but at the same time macam they still like if to me that those are like lucky people macam dorang macam
bertuah lah to like you know at least hit at least find something that you know they're good at even if even on that even at that age
like even though dorang dah macam tua tua gitu macam forty plus tapi macam masih dapat
dapat buka apprenticeship
buat ni semua like
but at the same time kalau asyik asyik kena
macam like if you always like you know kalau you always work work hard je asyik asyik work hard abeh lepas itu macam
macam tak ada tak ada luck like people don't like it's just not your bidang lah it's not your industry
like you try so many things macam you try masak you try restaurant
retail abih you try ah apa lagi ah engineering abih lepas itu
you don't know you nak buat apa
so macam you'll never run out of things to like
betul juga ah betul juga ah
what you say ada ada sense
kalau you cannot minta for like more wish
okay so my first wish I rasa I would be eternally rich
so I can beli anything that I want
macam at least macam treated as human beings lah
at least macam in terms of salary in terms of of the will
kaum lelaki tengok kita basically I just wish for like you know equality you don't look at us as like object
but the thing is memang betul lah darjat wanita dah naik kan memang tinggi lah di islam tapi
break out of it right like it's so hard for us to like break out of tradition because it's already been part of us for so long like since kita kecil sampai sekarang dah besar pun
kalau kita nak macam you know like cakap example like wedding my friend
they are going to like make a big hotel wedding because ah suami dia is apa itu anak seorang
they want to buat besar besar because they are only going to have one wedding ever
kan membazir and then like to her she feels like she don't need lah because most of the people she won't she won't even kenal
and then at the same time macam in at the same time you so you follow lah if you mampu ke tak betul tak
uh ideal matches to be kahwin
must be soft spoken must be so macam
at the same time you know I'm glad that like you know I went over there macam like
yeah I like like went through whatever yang kesakitan all this nangis nangis kat sejadah ni semua macam
is at the same time macam you do have like some of this
regret macam eh kalau aku tahu aku tak pilih dia aku tak cakap yes kat dia macam
okay for the third wish kan
kita kena make it a fun one
kita kena macam as merepek ah tapi macam like
like jangan serious sangat ah
so kirakan I can masak any makanan that I want
entah eh
right right I think so too I think I will be like but the thing one thing I don't let is to ikut recipe
I for me I don't really macam I tengok recipe I look at the ingredients but I don't macam ikut one tablespoon
one pinch of salt all this kind of thing I tak ikut
you know I mean agak agak is like fun leh it's like oo you know you are making a portion or you like making something like oh it's a hit and miss like oh if hit
today then like okay good for you if it doesn't hit then okay then next time I know that I have to put more gula and stuff like that
frenzy it's like a it's like a trouble it's like a to me it's like macam like that time I masak sambal tumis telur eh sambal tumis like mixture of sausages
lobster balls meatballs dengan
buat sambal tumis tapi kan tak ada bawang merah tau like there's no onions
so I decided to use bawang putih
and to me because mummy kata
bawang putih is like a good alternative and also like you know bawang putih is more flavorful macam kalau you masak nasi goreng if you don't have bawang putih it's fine you can just use garlic garlic is important lah basically
so I use garlic and I put like five cloves of garlic and it was to me it's a bit too much lah because you can literally rasa the garlicky taste
and then I did macam lada kering
and all that jazz and then after that I tengah masak kan
and then I was just like I feel like dia punya
bawang putih punya taste macam still overpowering you know
so I letak sugar and then it was like uh
so I put then I put kicap and then I put uh it was like a it was like a frenzy ah it was like a
like a carnival like basically macam
I just I just whatever I can think of right I just campak kat dalam
yes imagine you ask me for rendang
I can cook any rendang you want rendang johor rendang penang rendang sarawak
italian rendang you want the crispy rendang
rendang and yes I want uh the skin of the chicken is not crispy you know
ugh serious nye
appreciation so far macam like Singapore nights festival all this
you're going to say about the penang right the padang kari that we had in Thailand right
oh my god okay jap jap jap
apa eh okay you say yours first ah
bukan kita nak pergi ice skating ke
and leisure park sana
no kita nak pergi bowling ke apa
atas tu ada ada movie
kenapa kenapa lah manis sangat diabetes tau
then kita makan Nandos dekat berjaya time eh
apparently I kena santau
yeah I kena santau abih lepas tu I tak ada mood apparently my mum said I was someone else then I diam je then my mum belikan makan I didn't even touch it I didn't even eat it then mum hold me ah she felt like my body was ice cold
and then she was like like she baca baca all this
apparently after we left after we leave the punya mall right then then I was okay already then I rasa lapar then I feel like want to eat
then my mum was like okay lah let's go eat dekat kedai makan yang kat bawa like some
macam sikit sikit/malay lah like
where mummy masak me birthday for my sixteenth sixteenth birthday
because like mummy right she only masak bila birthday for the rest of my sisters
but my birthday right she always masak macam sotong
or macam kari ayam lemak cili api macam this kind of but she never masak any birthday for me then I feel like eh
how come never masak me birthday then I ask ah mummy never masak me birthday for me ah
then she say you you want you nak is it then I cakap ya
then she masak me birthday and then I sakit on that day
okay what how how bodoh is it
if one horse size otter eh that one seram seh
tapi kalau hundred otter size horses
kecil kecil macam miniature gitu
ya ya ya that's true you like tendang tendang tendang then it keeps on coming back
yeah that's true that's true I think ya I think I also ambil the
is macam macam imagine kalau you jumpa lipas abih besar punya ee seram nya tapi tapi like
tak sanggup tak sanggup one is enough
yeah I think gila seh
tak ada orang yang boleh ambil dia ah like tak ada orang boleh defeat dia ah even thanos you know even thanos like start ask the army to rain down
apart from rendang if you talking about like metaphorically
kalau if you talking about food I think I will get uh kari ayam
I already say kan
kalau metaphorically I think right I'll get
a bit too sassy lah macam that's why I think people don't like
like macam macam okay a bit world ah I guess
no lah but it's more of like okay like arrogance as as in macam
entah eh arrogance as if like I'm a bit too over confident
entah eh
merepek lah what you mean intimidating you not intimidating at all lor
no as in macam is not even like you not even intimidating lorh
yeah I'm I'm talking about macam or you talking about work ah
ya but if you have to kalau you nak kena pilih satu je
Jollibee atau Arnold's
simple gila dok
ya lepas I think we can we go again
ah belum buka lagi
I think central kot like
ya dia punya fries dia punya cheese tak lokek seh
gila dia punya dia punya cheese
dia punye cause its potato bun
so is different but at the same time macam rasa muak
no lah still can go cuma tak ramai orang ah
my friend semua dah pergi seh this week I see all of them
semua pergi jewel
tak tak ramai but dorang semua pergi pergi jewel
tahu lah you ambil I lah
tak ah kata tu pe dating dating mestilah bawak kena ambil orang must fetch me from one side then must bring cannot complain you know
ada pe
berapa is it by minute or by entry
gila ah
kita pergi kita pack ah
kita kita makan kita pastu kita ciao tempat lain
okay apa
okay okay ah kita berapa lama lagi ni
lagi lima belas minit eh
kena does does it have to be one hour
mm fikir fikir
but that at the same time if you have if your body is fit your muka haprak but then your personality is nice then okay lah
and if you manage to macam you know capture me with your humor then
topic topic perbincangan
cause yellow is a good energy punya
like you look at yellow then you just like oh you know sedap mata memandang gitu
so macam
turun a bit the pain threshold
but sometimes you just feel like you need to feel the pain like you know you rasa macam
macam like if I want a sandwich I get a sandwich if I want airpods if I want a pair of airpods I get airpod if I want a laptop I get a laptop
and resale and kahwin everything
itu lah you don't have to worry
nanti what if you jadi pervert ke apa
like my greatest enemies right and then see what they're doing and then macam blackmail them
entah dia macam merepek ah
dia macam world ah I guess
to me dia macam world sikit ah
ya dia macam tak serious come on man you are the avatar man
I rasa tak keluar tak tau ah
for so macam tinggal
tapi monday I have to like upload
I mean macam I have a lot of pages a lot of a lot of development which is good but I'm technically in terms of the number of decks that have I'm far behind and I have two more weeks to complete fifteen decks
everybody else dorang tak macam explore tau dorang macam just do one that one that one that one that one that so macam
I don't know how they can just like not explore lah I I like exploring I like to macam
yeah I like to macam
if I see something I want to develop a bit more and more and more macam you know let it let it branch out
I see it so it's gonna be this if I see this it's gonna be this so macam
cause it's sunday kan
but I feel like this year macam I don't think they they should actually have
merepek ah like who comes up with this stuff
ya but at the same time and then like you you then dorang kata dorang nak do salute eh for nurses
claps and you know singing home and then like bonus macam at least just increase their pay for throughout their career
ya macam sausage all this kena potong potong kadang kadang pun I macam makan
okay lah is it bubble tea or macam Boost
kan I think so I also prefer Boost
ya then sometimes you just feel like like example macam you pergi interview that time I gi interview then after that I just
err my name azmirul I'm from singapore poly sekarang sekolah
you wanna talk about kita punya singapore poly life lah so far
sekarang boleh manage ah tapi like last time when I first entered aku really tak minat the course
so it was kind of susah lah untuk aku
oh pasal dulu my first few choices was uh business business finance abeh aku minat tourism
so I put there only my first six choice ah then my marine engineering was aku nya tujuh ke lapan ah
I not sure but yes ah aku aku tak minat tapi
aku nya points also don't give me any chance to go anywhere so aku just kena taruk the aku just kena taruk any course that I can put lah
tapi along the way alhamdulillah
aku minat ah aku minat
aku minat ah aku minat marine engineering nya module
so kau apa sekarang lah like what are you doing in school what are your activities
aku in dikir barat ah as you know
I I always tried to pull you in dikir barat masuk dikir barat tapi kau tak nak masuk so
now I really want to know the reason why kau tak nak masuk dikir barat
okay lah boleh boleh
muay thai pun
bukannya muay thai nanti
ada stage fright ke like macam ada spectators tengok
right faham faham I understand
because sekarang pun COVID
then like kita lima hari five days of school but we only come to school three days four days
then kadang-kadang
sama juga I went through the same process only that I wasn't an introvert from the start I create trouble almost all the time in secondary school
in my apa tu uh younger days ah my sec one sec two menengah satu menengah dua that kind so I
every month bapa kena call down until I was about sec three ya that was I realise yang
so that's when aku sedar lah that I have to bulk up kalau tak memang aku takleh survive N or O levels
I did get twelve points ah takleh
a decent decent decent grades for all my subject yang aku ambil
then aku end up in poly now
ya what is the most macam
what is the most naughty thing yang kau pernah buat secondary school
seems quite introvert and the most yang paling
so kira kan self self nominate kau terus masuk
actually talking about yang student student council student leader and
dulu like what you said I was very naughty nakal gila
macam apa aku buat semua aku kena tone down pasal aku chairperson of the class and my school dorang ada selalu macam best chairperson
best leader best apa so I was like
I cannot I cannot be last lah basically macam in the rankings so macam sec three tu memang quite tough lah is like I'm still naughty
but end up nanti cikgu jalan
dekat lorong angkat buku aku tolong ah I go angkat
teacher you need help ah then aku angkat aku angkat kan masuk staffroom
so kira like that was one of the worst because I didn't want student leader at all but I got it so aku just suck it up lah
and my teachers in sports leaders suka aku
pasal aku not the quiet type
but students leader punya cikgu tak suka aku pasal dia rasa aku naughty sangat so there's there's two ways that
goes around the school lah tu yang aku tak berapa suka pasal cikgu nanti ada different opinion about the same person
that's that's being naughty lah dekat sekolah
oh kira tu naughty ah kan
kira tu naughty ah kan
tu bikin kau paling guilty ah kan
guilty tak eh
jadi cikgu tertipu kan
so macam dorang dah bless ah
so lepas O level after N level
you got work as in got work part time ke
aku kerja yang kau tahu volunteer volunteer punya
yang nampak dekat uh fast jobs nanti dia cakap oh you volunteer for this run you get fifty dollar allowance ah kira that time too is big money for me know so kadang-kadang kalau ada shape run colour run or standard chartered I would just go for the volunteer
that was my basically aku nya work for my whole N level till when I go sec five ah
so aku akan kerja all the way
then basically nothing much ah aku just kerja dengan members dengan kawan-kawan with all my friends then after that after my O levels I started working properly I also work same F&B but not burger king staff
experience aku pernah tau sekali kerja
tiga hari jer off day aku nya gaji at that point of time was
going at seven fifty per hour and satu bulan aku dapat satu ribu lapan ratus
selepas minus
so if anybody interested join staff masuk lah ya so
irony but I do have some problems lah I do have some problems over there in terms of how I can click with the people because usually orang-orang yang kita kerja kat luar tu tak sama age
the same pemikiran lah basically so aku just
aku just tahan for two months then aku just took adapt aku just try to adapt to the situation lah yang aku aku was in
they are the best they are the best people to work with so friendly baik gila
ya they have to to keep to what let's say shampoos necessities semua dorang kena beli then they have to keep at home
wah salute ah dorang
I don't dah
oh is not always the sama part lah
like macam
as in aku prefer tau honestly aku would prefer a busy
a busy working environment pasal at least aku ada benda tau nak buat like something to do kalau they never come and visit they never come and buy your stuff you feel like you more tired and the time go slower
macam benda ni semua I can see cikgu kita are harsh in some ways but they are also training us to be macam very independent because in the future semua benda-benda engineering ni semua
they won't hari-hari tengok kau buat
that's why macam I feel engineering early brush you lah and if you you are not focus in the course you will really flop ah
macam betul-betul flop then susah once you know once dah jatuh in poly susah nak naik balik
aku masuk shore which is first first semester so right after this semester aku probably has a month's break then after that aku dah kena masuk intern lah
by dia punya sailing
aku nak belayar basically I just want to go
explore countries negara semua negara england semua whatever lah
uh yang ada ports semua kan saudi arabia ke whatever
so aku memang aku memang tahu yang kalau nak
dapat sailing results must be very strong
so aku legit work very hard
untuk aku year one year two tapi
aku punya type is aku tak suka lawan dengan takdir ah
so at the end of the day aku don't mind shore kalau dapat keppel okay lor
kira very good orh keppel
ya betul
but ya lah you so you are willing lah kau kira willing untuk sail every year six months
time kau balik pun dah penat
so your ultimate goal is to get macam
pasal you are not away from your family too long
surveyor macam benda relax ah
okay ah during during circuit breaker and all we all semua stuck dekat rumah
pelik but yes aku
aku found a love from
karma medic lah nama youtube channel
and aku suka biomedical from there so I did more research on it
fun fact during secondary school I took physics but all my physics class I never go you know where I go I go inside bio class duduk belakang dengar
but ya the love come back and I feel like kalau I do well in my poly get the highest that I could
I can probably try for biomedical engineering when I go uni ke apa
ya so talking about uni kita belum lagi lepas
wayang ah
so ah the frogmen one tu yang paling gerek ah
so aku nak masuk navy tapi aku tahu
aku tahu tak probably tak ada chance lah masuk navy kan
ada chance will be slim
but yes ah so kalau
tak aku nak try my best to go police
kalau police pun
aku kena train banyak so definitely I got a feeling that would be PES
kalau tak pun I don't mind
eh pula I don't mind civil defense
tu pun pergi tau sampai berapa tiga puluh minit dah sampai
my father never go so aku rasa I'll be the first to enter so I think I know always the first person will always kena hijau from the trend lah that's what they say lah but no hijau for me because secondary school I was in
and find it boring lah my opinion macam gitu-gitu jer ya okay lah tengok macam mana
tapi kalau aku dapat air force who wouldn't take it
chey wah pandai seh tak ah intelligence
what was your score though they never tell you tak bilang
but how do you think you did though was it like okay did you find it difficult ke apa
kalau let's say ke dah dah minat nak sign on
kena berapa bagus wow
ada size dia ah
sekarang berapa years
masih eh masih sama aku ingat sekarang dah tiga tahun jer primary school
bila primary school kan nanti
nanti kita tengok movie movie who's your idol who's your idol who do you like
that kind of thing you so from there kita semua dah
dah basically know the type of person you want to be like err like for me last time when I was in primary school
one of the first macam entertainment punya movie show kan was ah
macam I didn't realise tau yang itu semua watak
as in tu semua bohong macam bedek tu semua just rekaan tau I didn't know
then I thought macam okay let's say macam dulu undertaker betul-betul lah dia jahat betul-betul lah dia nak nak nak menang jer nak kasi orang sakit
so I like the character so everytime I come school I try to walk like macam undertaker
buat mata dia yang roll eyes back
so kira macam last time primary school was one of the best times because
kita explore ah
kita explore banyak benda
satu hari kita undertaker the next day we john cena the next day yuka civi
ya in primary school also dulu kita suka buat banyak parkour
striker yang
bebas like horse kick right
have you ever win the finals pernah menang
who's your bogey team ah macam selalu jumpa dorang mesti
macam you felt just dropping on your shoulders like suddenly
for me kalau bab-bab
macam atau activity kan
I was goalkeeper you know you know when kau penjaga gawang in primary school
if the goals you concede so we basically second round kita dah keluar everytime
kita masuk south zone kita keluar kita group stages
then secondary school I was in so kau tahu ada banyak
lah yang joget-joget sambil marching
ah make the police create the league untuk macam orang-orang tak
untuk all the budak melayu not only budak melayu lah budak melayu budak cina there are all types of races to come as a team to play football
so I entered that under my school name with all my classmates with all my schoolmates my juniors and seniors semua masuk
tu pun second round kita out
I join dikir barat
I join dikir barat and my first ever performance
so of course after the performance aku nangis siol
aku really my heart was pouring ah
so that that was when my mood for dikir honestly
aku kena aku kena step in to change
for dikir barat
I didn't it's not I didn't want to take it but my parents ragu-ragu ah
my parents will think eh macam mana aku nya anak nya results
sekolah pelajaran akan jeopardise ke tak
that kind of thing so aku pun macam second guess ah aku second guess but I love dikir barat so much
in dikir barat twenty eleven champion twenty twelve champion twenty thirteen fifth twenty fourteen first
the podium kind of accomplishment something that you never face before like macam nama engraved dekat dekat kau nya trophy I also never had the recognition of
pemenang dikir barat singapore poly never had that kind of recognition so but I feel like being a captain itself
it's a heavy responsibility tapi we have fun doing it right like it's fun leading and it's fun
macam teaching
your kawan takkan eh coach pasal they coach kau marah dia tapi kau as a kawan kau still tolong that kind of thing
we have our ups and downs juga ah
kau cannot
kalau kau always feel that you are at the bottom
dah kita dah improve at least be happy about it jangan cakap yay tak last
that that that pada aku tu yang paling penting ah dalam
dalam inner change
you can't keep thinking of eh kita dulu last
as in berbual macam single ke attached ke seeing someone
mana lah aku tahu aku dah lama tak jumpa
kau boleh click ah basically
cinta monyet eh dulu
happy ah dapat berbual dengan kau talk to you for an hour get to know you a bit more
and terima kasih ah
eh hello dah lama tak nampak kau how are you ah
eh can ah go makan lah
biasa biasa jer
penat ah tapi manageable juga ah baru habis peperiksaan seh
eh aku terdengar kau nak jadi jurugambar eh
so sekiranya kau kena like menyerah segala-galanya mengejar impian anda apakah anda akan menyerah
never mind lah slowly slowly eh order makan dulu ah
I think I want nasi goreng you leh
eh if you were to makan a dish for the rest of your life right apa kau pilih ah
tu ah tapi power seh sedap seh
that time ah aku pergi south korea aku makan dia punya barbeque shiok tempat dia pun boleh tahan the place damn atas
um agaknya adalah juga macam like report card or like artwork last time ah zaman secondary school cause last time I always like do a lot tapi biasa ah hilang ah
aku ni sekarang penat kerja sia so tiring to work
eh never thought about it sia agaknya kita depend a lot on government kot
betul juga ah tapi kau tengok ah situation these days like a lot of people keep asking for help leh

wah sekali ah we never realise our bank account negative already
eh berbual pasal COVID COVID ni semua kan aku dengar that time kau kena pergi concert kan apa jadi ah
I don't know eh cause ah I quite close to my family but right my course I think like kebanyakan ah I dengar dia suruh belajar overseas cause singapore tak offer banyak arts then like usually offer is like overseas tapi don't know eh overseas dia jauh seh macam kat gitu kalau you can choose tempat nak belajar overseas where you want go
okay okay make sense make sense but eh kita macam orang melayu ni susah seh nak belajar overseas cari makan semua
to be honest kan aku not the type to tengok ah why right aku that time sampai tak tidur seh kau tahu cerita girl from nowhere
tak tak it's a series and wah I tell you wah eh my mind I cannot think straight eh it's a thriller show dia macam she damn sinister like then I went to research a bit ah then dia cakap like she's anak like a devil's daughter and then right she always like come back she will mess up with people I think you should give it a try you should go try watch you leh what kind of show you watch
so kirakan dia syaitan tapi dia tolong orang ah
no leh ah to be honest ah I a bit scared eh that place damn ulu but don't know eh banyak orang kata best don't know should try maybe you can go one day
oh then kau tak plan nak jumpa dia lagi ke

tak apa lah dah puasa dah boleh gain balik eh tanya ah what's your favourite kuih raya
wah legit ah lain kali pergi rumah dia dia buat ah
favourite kuih raya to be honest tak tahu eh agaknya cornflake ah everybody's like confirm favourite one tapi kan sekarang these days banyak modification ah ada yang tukar nanti letak kismis lah eh tak suka seh I like the original one
hmm biasa biasa biasa ah last time I also like that ah tapi wah sedap [seh]
tu ah like personal experience right then wah every year confirm hor you open your cabinet raya finish already still confirm got a few more then obviously we go people house we ask them top up we helping them finish what make their money worth
I think ah I don't actually remember seh I think hor wah I think I just go makan man I go makan but sad lor makan only five people per table mah so everyone have to sit far far apart like now also you want go makan see everybody also sit so far apart
hmm eh then like hor during the circuit breaker during the circuit breaker hor what was your most like you cannot tahan one
to be honest ah aku ni boleh consider ah ada obsession sikit singaporean ah typical bubble tea wah when they announce ah that bubble tea closing wah jialat I already like stress eh cause like how I don't know how long they reopening what then I tried to find like other ways that I can like sub to my bubble tea wah nothing beats to it eh legit I then I just wah keep thinking of it pastu bila dia dah buka nak beli tengok queue dia tak apa ah kirim salam you leh do you drink bubble tea
eh tu sedap seh ya actually kan aku nak sub tu untuk aku punya bubble tea tau bila circuit breaker then wah jialat that one also close everything close then I don't know what to drink anymore then I think ah the circuit breaker ah was like diet to me
you buy the which one I heard the paling trend nya kan is the colour pink tu
yang pearls dia colour pink then when you go Playmade what you drink sia
eh abeh kalau compare kan semua bubble tea kan kau rasa mana satu yang paling mahal
tak eh sedap tak
oh abeh entah eh aku macam nak beli pun macam berat hati seh mahal seh uh abeh kat sekolah kau aku selalu dengar dari sekolah kau orang selalu beli bubble tea sedap ke bubble tea dia
I don't know eh to be honest ah I don't really like my school food cause first day my I I I know your school got like student price right my school standard price leh for public also then it's quite pricey then also ah not a lot of halal food then want find halal food cannot really find anywhere then maybe hmm like can only eat like McDonald's like that one easy ah halal but if you go food court that all ah quite difficult then hari hari makan nasi ayam ah then don't know eh got try my school food before
wah jialat I tell you ah wah if can ah I want buy roller blade sia it's damn far it's like my school is one end to the other end cause last time ah dengar dengar ah dorang kata my sekolah building burn down so dorang nak reclaim dorang letak at a new place ah so dorang letak new place tu dorang letak kat belakang then wah punya lah jauh like katakan eh you thought ah you thought you reach school early but wah you still reach class late but luckily my class got fifteen minutes grace so like okay lah can still use that fifteen minutes to jalan jalan your school leh your school so spaced out seh it's not besar but I think it's quite spaced out not far meh from one class to the other
but your school ah a bit weird leh cause like if see from in front ah quite small padan ah got behind behind some more quite complicated leh don't know how you can like learn how to find your way around
eh but right I know your school ah a lot of people just go there wah say only ah study always tell parents study but actually they don't really study one ah confirm like only merayap here merayap there then walk here walk there only you irritated or not
eh but sekerang tengah COVID ni tak ada orang kick you out ke you still can study at school meh
hmm but okay lah at least not like a lot of student now so so a bit better you all still got a bit more space then some more ah COVID now also you all kena separated must sit far far apart right
eh how your nenek ah like she cannot go out she at home only ah
wah not bad ah your nenek can know how to use this atas atas app
okay okay no wonder I was about to like wah so atas this one nenek modern is it then like your other family member leh they go out they work from home or go out also
hmm so like that nobody at home your nenek find more chance to keluar lah
then do you prefer her lama one or sekarang one
hmm then favourite makanan like masakan dia what for you
hmm then kau often tak tolong dia kat dalam dapur
but tak salah your area semua dekat dekat jer kan
oh abeh usually you all walk or like what
hmm but okay lah at least you with your nenek is it then you got friend then you can talk talk like that
hmm then wah did you miss your nenek cooking when you go school or what
dan hari ni kita akan berbual tentang anything under the sun
school sekolah
super senang apa lagi
like is it fun ada kawan-kawan ke tak
abeh kau punya time table like how is your
is it banyak time untuk relax atau tak
abeh pukul berapa what like what time is your lesson
oh ya I saw like I always see your Instagram like kau macam penat gila because you always like
abeh aku wave at you and you literally didn't you ignored me bro I was so sad
no aku literally waved at you
embarrassed kan ya aku pun I felt so malu because of that
that time aku remember that I told you the story
like that time I was down your block I saw this girl pakai tudung exactly same as you
err I aku aku not mad at you aku mad at the situation because aku was so embarrassed aku malu gila I was down the block
I saw uh cause it was at night malam-malam so aku saw this lady
she was wearing her tudung and she was in the dark
wave paling besar di dalam dunia like literally like this
macam tak kena gitu situation gitu
ya so for me sekolah aku I think it's super senang to go to school because I don't have to take a bus
aku tengah flex right now ya
ya cause now my school kalau kau nak masuk kau nak kena ada dia punya card like the specific card
measures no uh no as in in terms of the zones like for your school kau ada zone like different different zones
yang colour biru merah orange
the only my school has mala at uh food court empat
ya tu pun
oh kita punya junior eh
oh dia makan mala
ya ya tapi kita boleh masuk ke tak
but the thing is mala at causeway point macam mahal gila
I don't know if it's mahal gila eh
no tapi um I told amira then I um err apa jaz
jaz she ate it it was like seven dollar per person cause dia tak makan the daging semua the daging is a mistake
who eats the daging you just go for the
that doesn't count as daging that counts as one of those processed meat macam spam daging is like literally daging yang macam masak tu
of course it's gonna be mahal it's like duck meat err
remember duck meat punya ramen that we ate at the apa
I was asking my bapa cause he was like asking like suggestions to eat and I was like oh can I suggest then I was like oh can we eat at the ramen and then he was like err I'll think about it then we never eat
was it one of those like lemak
oh ya sebab kau punya stomach kan ada problem sekarang
kesian baby
uh sebab you're like a baby you can't like handle the full Samyang experience that sounds like a
macam like the gravy ah
I don't I don't get why you don't like the carbonara one carbonara one is literally like the best punya flavour
man aku baru makan Samyang on is it yesterday or two days ago
is it because you never leave it inside for a longer time because I like my Samyang to be like puffy what's the word macam like
oh I don't know why but semalam aku macam on a
university punya rush so I was like looking at all the
ya because I aku fikir uh I really don't have a choice but to like look through siapa lia punya boyfriend sekarang dekat kan
what was his his course ah or should I ask like lia to ask him about dia punya experience
ada banyak mm
dorang take in like
ya kau tak kau tak research ke
then lepas poly kau nak buat apa
you actually like oh so kau macam like committed ah in that sense okay
uh aku scared yang dorang tengah trying to convince you to spend more money by the way they say it
she ya you should just since kau ada connection might as well just take advantage of it ah
dekat singapore
kerja kat perth ah
jangan world ni dah dah start ni dah start dah start
tadi tadi macam like on a you're still on the ground tapi ni a bit like floating
you I thought your mum ada your mum kasi
or I thought she was the one yang ada attachment punya issues dengan kau
macam like my kawan elisa
dia pun like thinking of
yang half malay half chinese yang whose in my classmate
oh tu tahu okay um elisa dia selalu kata but to her ma yang oh
ma one day I might want to go to like overseas or like migrate and then she's then cause she's like the youngest one and then all her kakak is like big
so dia mak dia selalu like oh then I'll come with you lah macam gitu
cause mak dia is quite to tua lah ya
and she said it okay okay she did lah it wasn't kinda like show off show offy punya manner
so aku then I was like aku macam shocked because I didn't know this also like it makes sense lah because she's also like super smart
my course is so filled with so many smart people aku macam so intimidated
it's uh sometimes no no we're not competitive that's not like the that's just not our culture lah our punya course punya culture like no one is like
we're like so sikit
punya orang if we like make enemies then the ecosystem will like break you get what I mean
kau punya course banyak orang y'all make enemies you won't you can just like
tak tahu err but I think she's still going for the
apa macam plan like have like one whole like plan for like dorang punya rest of their lives
after poly dorang gi university then after that apa kerja sikit then
so like whenever I'm with her aku macam like intimidated sikit ah sebab aku selalu kan aku ada going with the flow punya attitude
but I know what I want to like but at least like luckily I got like what I want to do lah I think it's my intern lah you were right what you were saying apa
kau punya comment lah like huda I'm so proud of you
pergi overseas
tapi dia like pandai enough to go for local uni ah so I'm not too worried about her
uh I think her overseas dream is untuk like
like kerja sana
ya sebab dorang ada minimum wage semua
I mean kau ada
it's better to like have a loan with your parents than a loan with like a bank because banks are always like the interest semua the
ya I think the realisation that kita macam like growing up just like hits
oh sebab ada dina
ah foundation or whatever tak tahu
I want to learn more about like apa
aku nak belajar more about macam like social work gitu
when I went for my intern I really like felt macam like left uh not left out lah I just felt
not in the social work ah kan aku bilang kau social service organisations semua
tu like in the
kalau all fails I I can be like a teacher kau pun nak jadi teacher
cikgu kan
cikgu aliah
I mean like aku aku knew that I had like interest in like
kerja for like the community gitu like I like to give back to the society gitu because like
doing business just like sucks the life out of you like it's so like macam boring and like
I really like at the end of the day aku macam like
macam apa haziq
haziq dia pergi apa kau tahu yang internship yang international
but then sebab
the overseas punya internship it was supposed to be overseas
ah tak tahu pula
ya tapi sebab dia kan like
dia he okay okay so
I know kau kind of like sceptical pasal dia punya like wealth
tapi uh elisa like dia explain to aku like dia punya how
in this like manner maybe kau macam like believe
so dia millionaire sebab
he would like his family would like invest in like oil punya stocks
apa return investment I'm like aku macam like a terrible
hundred thousand which should like deduct to be like sekarang kau believe tak
ni ni on like um oil
dorang kaya dorang like old money
cause sebab uh apa
on last friday tu aku I had to do like a sharing
sharer there who's like an punya student tapi haziq was there also and I'm like ugh
ah nanti aku show kau I was like talking about pe
you know aku pulled out all the I pulled out all the cards macam
and then he also talking about his internship ah tapi really kesian dia lah dia macam kau
apa cause about COVID then he had to like
come back to singapore gitu
kau cancelled immediately sebab was like in a mess
tapi this one was like indonesia was still like okay lah singapore indonesia boleh pergi because it was like in the same like circumference
so they ah pergi lah but then
after that they were like err this is worst than we expected you have to come back then gitu
because your one is apa macam tourist punya management so you you had to like have people there
this one was like business so everything could have been done online lah so it semua makes sense ah I'm
be tapi aku didn't like expect there's like oh
kau nak cakap pasal addison rae
I think that's like her brand lah that's macam apa jojo siwa
oh ya allah
then kau jangan kau jangan tengok video dia lah it's like she's not forcing you to watch her video
like I saw dia buat yang makeup punya video yang dia buat like clown
tak tahu lah
tak tahu lah I just see jer
wait aku Google avani net worth sekarang
oh dia tu takde like takde dia punya it
whoa kau kau memang critical of her eh
she's ni budak kecil
ya allah you're too critical of this show eh
dah kau punya addison rae punya sharing dah habis
would I love to talk to her but if I know like aku someone sikit
like dia he can talk lah
so but james sekarang kan dia ada banyak like years of experience sebab dia kan he was like he was the cover girl
he was the first like male punya cover girl so he went for a lot of apa talk shows dengan ellen semua
you know so kau you need to like be like
baik like kinder to them sikit lah please
tapi dorang famous
kau nampak yang TikTok punya
coffee punya tu manis oi and I was like seeing like four pumps of like mocha you know you saw that one
I aku aku bilang kau kan yang coffee kadang kasi aku macam anxiety so aku macam aku sangat
it's like I think uh cause I think aku ada break from coffee sebab I was like
kat rumah the whole time so I didn't like really was like
then after that uh I think a couple of weeks ago when I texted you was the first macam like
time minum coffee then aku my anxiety was like I had like I was so anxious
and then suddenly aku macam like so like scared
that day aku minum coffee day lah because I thought it was just like a one off thing you know
macam you know experiment we have to do it like a couple of times to make sure you're right
sekarang aku really cannot minum coffee again
which is sedih cause I love the taste of coffee you know how much I love like the taste of coffee
was it because of anxiety or apa
kau bodoh eh that's like the worst
kau macam better lah so
tapi tak pernah pass out
the day you actually pass out then you're like oh huda aku pass out I'll be like
kau nak pass out kan pass out lah
I guess now sebab aku tak boleh minum coffee then it should be easier for both of us ah so whenever Starbucks ada one for one I will never ask you
best punya
because uh aku try the LiHO punya pun
um it just doesn't hit as much as Sharetea punya oo
the matcha doughnut yang aku beli that day
it was so sedap sebab aku popped it in the microwave for like ten seconds it
but I bought also the mochi punya dough the like circle circle tu
uh mochi okay aku Google eh sebab uh kau tahu newt dari TikTok

halal punya baker

ya dia date untuk
like she wants them to act way more mature for their age dia ada dia punya expectations
terlalu high
and she's she expect all these guys to have like a stable job when apa dorang kat poly ke serving
you know kita tengah sekolah
is it sebab dia desperate to like

you know banyak demands
the protected gear ah eh and then uh quite safe ah kau kau kalau ikut all the safety protocols ah everything should be fine and should be
guess there's no I would I would say little risks involved ah I mean I'm a clinic assistant myself so I've been working there for six months or so and I've been healthy ever since aku tak pernah ambil semua seh so aku maybe ah my immune system is strong but I would say that if you follow the protocols everything should be fine
mm kalau kau tengok betul-betul kat luar pun there's a lot of a
uh and it's been a growing trend ah I see a lot of uh races actually uh branching into this line cause selama ni aku tengok pun orang yang kerja grab food pun ye lah orang-orang kita kan betul tak
tapi sekarang dah macam banyak orang nak cause of the situation then they have no choice and they know that
kalau aku aku ada bini anak semua aku kena jaga aku kena kerja at least gaji aku eh aku at least rasa kena at least two point five and above ah itu pun depends kalau aku ada banyak anak ke tak kalau tak aku rasa kerja-kerja normal is quite risky ah kalau kau kerja macam
err gaji yang one K plus jer unless if you only living with your wife
mm that's the mindset of the youngsters nowadays ah you know our generations especially tapi if you were to think about it
know the traditions tu yang susah tu the culture of our our race kan kita nak ada banyak anak nak kena
you know cause they can't even sustain themselves abeh macam mana seh nak sustain kalau ada anak semua kan nak kena bayar bill
bayar susu diapers semua I mean of course definitely they they you know dapat baby bonus ni semua tapi berapa lama seh boleh tahan
tak boleh tahan kan aku rasa
ya but singapore pun
I mean kau kena faham-faham ah singapore dorang akan kasi kau grants for free nya apa
err like sekarang kau tengok dorang dah increase traffic eh electricity nya price nanti air pun nanti mungkin naik so but I mean the government they are doing their best lah I think cause they really want singapore to success to succeed as a country kan to remain at the top
abeh no choice ah
government I think government will try their best lah but we we still have to find ways ah no matter what aku rasa
kita kena hustle ah this is a hustling years lah just like macam dulu ah time SARS zaman SARS dulu pun dorang
economy pun jatuh tapi kau tengok slowly
singapore will rise up again and it's really up to ourselves ah we cannot really depend on the government we have to hustle and hustle till we make it ah orang cakap
so speaking of which you see the bills for our housing dah berapa jer
tapi personally aku tak tahu ah aku rasa
easily if you're stressed you know you have to take care of your body ah mentally physically aku tengok ramai sekarang kerja kerja kerja tapi tak exercise tak you know take their time to you know relax to ease off kalau tak
kau pun boleh terjejas ah kesihatan kau nanti kau pun teruk ah
macam lagi ramai orang I mean dorang dorang memang susah pe so I think macam aku nak cakap dorang dah get used to it lah abeh tapi I think this is more troubling for people who are in the
uh wealthily macam orang yang senang abeh tiba-tiba jadi susah macam gini kan then dorang macam terus jadi stress sebab tak biasa dengan keadaan macam gini kan
dalam susah aku rasa sebab dorang dah biasa susah so dorang might know what to do or might hustle even like normally ah they do like hustle really hard tapi orang yang dah dah biasa senang dah biasa ada kerja
high position semua gaji besar tiba-tiba kena buang abeh tak boleh survive kan gini so that's why dorang stress kan
and then we have to fight through ah and speaking of which kan berbual pasal COVID aku recently baca news trump kena COVID is it true
aku tengok ah siol tapi the thing is kenapa china buat macam gini eh I mean what's the rationale
behind their their actions macam I I don't think there's any benefit or anything to prove
apa ni world
organisations eh yang the one with apa united nations is it
dorang pun are against it tau abeh aku tak faham kenapa they are still doing this eh but I think cause they are in the position of power so they don't give a they don't care ah aku just buat ni tak ada orang boleh stop aku
so even though aku might say that I'm not
with trump but since trump is against china kan aku might side with trump ah just for the sake of you know of what he did of what china did to our muslims kan
then aku rasa it's it's it's really cruel ah but I don't know why kau rasa kenapa dorang buat macam gini eh
which are aku rasa it's just too much ah to be honest this is just like macam zaman-zaman dulu seh if kalau kau belajar history kat secondary school semua kan kalau kau belajar kau tengok ah hitler kau tengok macam orang macam um stalin of what they have done
so it's aku rasa it's just it's just effed up ah aku rasa zaman sekarang dah rabak ah aku rasa nak dekat akhir zaman serious
sebab setahu aku eh
the black err civil rights activist ni semua they have been fighting for the black lives for so long and yet
I don't understand the the the reason why they are so against the black people macam
aku rasa tak tahu eh macam
that's what I heard also ah macam apa ni dia ada counterfeit nya duit kan
but I think this is really just how the the mindset of the police or how the system of the police dekat america is being
ah so kalau aku rasa kalau kau as an american kan kau tinggal kat sana baru kau tahu ah macam mana
aku tak aku tak imagine kalau this situation were to happen in singapore
kita sikit jer dah riot dah satu satu dunia satu ni dah kecoh satu country
apa lagi kalau legit kalau kita nampak kita kita kalau witness kita nya own singapore police buat gini confirm kecoh habis perang habis kasi habis ni cakap
ah aku rasa
I think it memang exist ah aku rasa the government is doing their best that's why they have all these laws have all these
take care of the other racial feelings but you you cannot escape from all these soft racism ah it it will happen in all countries in all places and aku rasa that's why the government
tapi nak buat macam mana kalau government tak tekun dengan dia punya laws semua kan tak tak really ah
be serious about this then aku rasa kita nya country
will be like other countries ah I mean let's just look at our neighbour ah malaysia kau tahu malaysia sendiri kalau
okay aku sendiri melayu kan aku tak nak cakap
tapi aku rasa the malay rights over there it's
it's belittling the other races ah tak tahu ah aku rasa dari malaysia
so kalau aku bangsa lain aku cina kata kan aku cina eh abeh aku nak beli rumah aku malaysia citizen tapi aku cina setakat bangsa aku cina tapi aku kena bayar extra mahal sebab aku cina
eh a'ah betul juga eh
macam dorang tak bersyukur eh macam apa dorang dapat
that's what aku personally see lah or feel bila aku when aku tengok kat news
err videos on the internet what what kau rasa macam mana sana kau pernah gi sana tak
and it's sad to see ah tapi aku tak faham ah kenapa najib dia dia dah kena tangkap kan aku dengar dia dapat confirm he's dia dah found guilty kan
it's just so chaotic macam tak ada orang control seh macam those pekik-pekik suka hati abeh marah-marah parliament lain
of all this it's it's very interesting to see how other countries govern the people or or choose their people to represent what aku tak faham ah macam aku tengok aku nak ketawa seh macam
boleh dorang ada orang macam gini to represent eh
mm aku pun nampak ni dekat facebook or youtube ah
but ah I think it's on twitter tapi how did he get away with this how can you ask someone to
but aku aku really wonder how
ah recruitment and the position that is of power ah macam ni semua position important important seh abeh kau suka-suka hati kalau boleh just get away with all these things
if you were given a choice eh kau will live in malaysia or would you want to live in singapore
the money money wise I think what I would do aku would probably kerja kat singapore
tapi um
tapi aku would live there so aku can know have a lot of make a lot of more money ah abeh aku boleh spend
ah tu eh that's true eh aku rasa I mean
tapi if if I want to be in singapore also having to wake up later and then it still it still I think in singapore it still all about work if you are in the not in the higher position ah which you have to climb eventually
aku rasa it's all about
or to live happily in singapore whatsoever tapi
ah currently I don't have any girlfriend cause we are living in hard times and I I don't think I can uh I think it's more important for me to focus on myself ah sia I need I need to get more money first for myself imagine if I have a girlfriend abeh aku tak boleh sustain mata air aku
then teruk ah puas hati aku ada banyak duit then aku boleh ada girlfriend then aku boleh you know
kita dua-dua boleh enjoy
tapi ya lah
then what kau kau ada mata air
know we we may not kita tak tengok orang-orang lain macam mana juga
people who are happily in the relationship together they dorang macam relax jer tak post apa-apa just happily stay together and all that so I think is I think we should not be influenced easily ah
to tengok orang macam gini semua kan I think ada segelintir ah mungkin dorang macam rasa the same thing tapi
ada juga ah golongan yang you know uh having good relationships ah so aku rasa kau should give a try tapi ye lah likewise you know aku rasa sekarang tengah susah kan so now it's not it's not the right time to to find a girlfriend but rather to upgrade yourself ah
whoever is lacking in in terms of financial or whatever tapi
for my race but entah aku rasa macam
tak boleh ah kita tak boleh sebagai lelaki kita kena tetap
you know tunjuk yang kita boleh lead anak orang betul tak
tapi no choice ah this is how
we uh most parents are dealing with their child cause kita pun nak kena survive pe nak cari duit it's all about money ah singapore is all about being financially stable ah and that sacrifice have to be made ah kalau kau nak
so aku rasa that's why some cultures they
abeh uh
abeh macam uh
dah terpaksa ah aku rasa it's dah macam
dah ni dah kehidupan orang-orang kita ah sekarang zaman-zaman sekarang lagi-lagi sekarang tengah hidup susah so
that's why aku rasa financial planning is very important kita kena plan sekarang before having a kid you know not just funfair buat lepas tu at last kita susah then all these problems come later for us to think so right now we have to think first before having a kid what should we are we
are we stable cukup tak makanan cukup tak duit untuk keluarga bayar ni bayar tu
and to have a beautiful family ah tu aku rasa ah um yup
on your end kau rasa apa
boleh ah you know got this uh oh god
finally dah holiday sikit ah so boleh lepak at home and uh
just main computer lepak keluar dengan family ya
macam gitu jer ah you never you never do anything interesting you know like

if we go korea but I don't think we will be able to handle dia orang punya

what the world is then we get macam
aku lagi penat daripada kau you know I did more things than you yesterday and I'm like
ya pasal lah penat
cause I don't know if I can do this anymore film penat sia
there's this macam
cause if you think of it that way and it depends on which mazhab you're looking at also
pasal if you're talking about
like kita punya mazhab memang we're not supposed to try gambling or anything
there's other mazhab that's like
like this idea of mazhab is it going to be valid in like fifty years if we're all still here
that's like my question because the mazhab thing came about because of
macam concerns lah
then is the mazhab thing going to change or what
a set in stone thing cause the mazhab thing was never like set in stone
people there might adopt our mazhab punya practices
she will be adopting other mazhab practices and when she comes back here
just about sembah this one tuhan
and believing in our prophets our rukun iman and rukun islam
touching a dog is haram so ya that's like my
macam over
to be fair kasihan ah dia dia macam

I want to say tak monday aku ada itu ambil course malam tu
tak boleh tak boleh cause currently is already practical right then they say err practical lesson takleh miss oh but monday onwards they taking live blood
the other time kat mannequin mannequin so taking each other
entah agaknya ah aku takut gila sia
oh tabik salute
tak apa it's okay good things await for those who
dah habis out of stock so sad
wallet yang tu lah yang the sometimes by designer tu I wanted the the the apa tu oh gosh oh dusty pink I swear I tell abang syafiq to buy fast
tengok oh but this one bulky
the one that I want is very apa tu very tipis dia boleh macam is literally wallet tau and then when you put the phone behind dia tak nampak bulky but cannot use with err cover I think
not phone casing bag lah it's a it's a wallet bag dia ada put phone belakang and it has chain chain strap
tapi tu bulky seh
I can't find any know macam like boring dia punya stroller semua macam like not the one that I want and they mostly is pre-order so that day I want to buy on the spot
abeh takleh ah abeh apa
ya so you open is really very nice actually I like the stroller then me and my friend kan keep on cari-cari like which one we want then finally we found this one is very nice but it's super expensive lah but it's okay lah one time beli
dia tak lightweight it's very berat it's like eleven
abeh lepas tu err I like thinking lah whether to get or not because at first
cause at first macam there's a there's other Nuna demi grow that we wanted but that one like besar gila and then but that one can put two people in two babies two babies
your head lah how can you sit ya you see you see tengok tengok show me ya that one that one the the tu a'ah cantik kan that's why you you see the video it's
cantik kan ah actually dia ada another one it's called Nuna Mixx ini Nuna Mixx next yang Nuna Mixx tu dia fold sama macam ni tapi dia tak boleh shorten so dia macam dia compact err so yang ni yang baru ni dia compact and very
apa tu dia fold just nice ah and it can stand on its own and then dia boleh recline sampai ah lay very flat untuk baby baring ya and then dia punya
dia punya canopy boleh tarik sampai kat bawah the canopy the tu the cover ye lah bila dia tidur then like sunlight right either that or you ah you don't want people to see the baby right then you just cover the whole thing and then the wheels are very big
like no you use up to six months after that lepas tu dah tak boleh pakai lagi
it's meant for something like that lah macam is heavy or probably the height or weight is not ah suitable untuk dorang anymore
so I decided to take I decided not to take the bassinet kind but I'm getting a car seat so that macam kalau I want to take grab ke apa ke
because only grab can use uh if you want to take grab you need to have a car seat kalau you take taxi tak payah car seat
cik usop kan kawan abah cik usop ah what oh my god my toe sakit gila skit gila
tapi why seh why is it even swollen eh
no lah I scared lah cause that time I also sakit kaki again you see already not the stroller you need to see how the dia nya tu
how it works ya you will see how how dia punya tu works I got so many things to clean
ya and then the belakang the belakang is meshed is like macam like on hot days right you can just take out the the top part lepas tu when she baring kan belakang dia dia boleh rasa ah panas eh apa the air and then this one also boleh buat like bassinet bassinet
because bawah dia punya feet area kan you can just snap out dia punya feet area tu then you snap back inside and then it becomes like a bassinet like that lah
abeh lepas tu I also like the I like the colour of the handle bar sebab dia colour vintage colour ya and then another thing because I bought it is because dia boleh pusing and baby can face me instead
ya and then like let's say lah macam err apa I don't want people to see her right even though she's facing me I can bring the canopy all the way down to cover her instead but she still can see outside because when I bring the canopy down dia tepi dia ada net ada meshed so she still can see some sunlight
ya it's good I can't wait can't wait for the barang to sampai next week I think about seven days
what baju mm mm
oh this is the baju you say you wanted to pakai eh wanted to buy and then scared dia tak sampai on time
hais so many things oh I want to give away a lot of bags away those tu semua kat dalam box tu I don't know nak tengok ah bag aku yang nak giveaway how to do work like this haiyo
a'ah seh dia dah half lah
and then washing machine pun belum habis the washing machine haven't finish ah so many things to do need dia ada dryer kat dalam dia but ya dryer dia is not is not ah drying lah tapi nak kena like ya it's damp so you you still have to like you still have to sangkut sidai outside
outside ah but it's now raining so I think I'm just gonna put it here then maybe kalau balik rumah jurong I will just bring bring along kalau macam I stay lama ah
ah ya tapi eh tapi ni tak boleh masuk banyak kalau dia nak kalau dia nak basuh like like everyday dia basuh like dua tiga kalau jeans jeans susah ah
tapi laundry mat it's okay lah just get laundry mat lah better what can wash all satu kali ni wash dua tiga kali nak kena wash seh as in cause banyak kan so kalau baju baby okay ah baju baby
is very little and small so I will just dump everything masuk dalam tapi bila drying dia kan it's sikit sebab dia punya drying is dalam basket kecil tu you have to keep inside that basket kecil then kalau letak banyak-banyak it won't kering
I mean it's good cause kita dah tak larat nak cuci tangan pakai cuci tangan ya socks underwears all the small small ah ni lah T-shirt can T-shirt can but then you see ah if he even if he wash this one right maybe he can wash and then drying he go down
go to laundry mat to cuci to dry satu kali and is more saving lah dari dia pergi pergi bawah then washing machine and then after that you know oh no cuci is one thing right and then dryer another thing right so if he manage to to wash kat sini kat dalam washing machine ni
uniform tak boleh masuk ni busy uniform masuk dalam ni ada ah just have to search ada ada but masalahnya dia nak angkat benda tu ah pergi toilet everytime
orh okay lah ya he can there's there's a slightly bigger one like like maybe double the size of that ya tengok ah dekat lazada ke shopee ke ah no lah ezbuy don't want ezbuy lambat sampai tak habis-habis seh
I mean shopee sells everything oh you know semalam kelakar abang boy called me
he said that his shopee nya barang delivered tapi tak sampai cause he find cannot find the barang so so I said to him lah you contact the seller lah and say mm that the barang tak sampai then after that ah then I fikir balik confirm he he don't know how to do all these lah kan maksudnya never mind lah you give me what's the items yang missing and then your home address ah
lepas tu he he already give me everything then after that he call me again he say takpe zurah dah dah jumpa mak buang kat dalam storeroom because because mak thought it's sampah because it comes in a plastic yang macam ya so mak thought it's sampah nasib baik mak belum buang he just dump she just dump it inside the storeroom abeh the funny thing is arrisa tak
cakap dengan mak is is barang ni tau don't know ah maybe ah cause mak ambil buat masuk agaknya then arrisa also
it's either that or it's either that or the dia macam ah saw it saw it somewhere lah
it's funny then after that I arrisa also laugh I heard over the phone lah kelakar gila mmhmm then mak ingat sampah
nasib baik tak terbuang baju baby seh I think she bought baju baby
I told her go shopee buy all the stuff don't buy me then actually on that day yang datang sana I wanted to show her macam mana nak pakai so busy and all that nasib baik ibu dah tunjuk dia
then abang boy macam like ah pening kepala cause she will start buying stuff I say it's okay lah it's still cheap seh rather than you want to go kiddy palace so expensive
I don't know mana tahu
then you think my back not sakit meh sit like this no because my kaki is sakit that's why macam duduk gini I think I'm gonna feel the same thing like that time apa the my left my left thigh sakit so I need to
because dia macam tangkap belakang I don't know ah but it's so sakit like and now it's not so bad yang that time nya really very bad it's so painful
ya let's hope I put cream esok malam ni nak nak urut lagi
tu ah
now she take lesser naps tau macam she can stay awake for longer time cause she's like almost two months already I can chill I can chill
mm the other night I didn't I didn't I I lambat change her ni kan change her diaper wah she melalak like kena pukul seh she rimas
aura after this we mandi okay after this can go mandi lah can go mandi lah correct
but it's funny because I I do your right side more than your left side you know cause I cause tadi I put like that right then you see so fast ya then this side yang tak then this side I've been doing like I'm very careful
she wants to stay awake dah nak tertidur dah
eh sakit seh I think really ah my leg no no no my toe my toe my toe not my leg
cause the other side also hari tu sakit tapi orh this one more painful
that time sakit dua-dua tapi this one the left side is more painful
then I was like ni siapa seh at first I saw the name lah but the name kan bukan aiman dia letak dia letak is it aiman instagram
oh he put aim E S R eh aim nama
ya lah aim nama dia apa aiman amsar eh ah
mana dia dapat that idea you should ask a'ah as in aiman aiman jer lah then suddenly the mother put aisar oh adik dia adik dia apa
a'ah ya ah semalam I heard you talk to shakirah pasal nama why ah like suddenly you you say macam dulu her name is aura nur sofia about her
mata dia gini jap lagi nak mandi dah tidur lah pula
aiyo nanti she cannot fit some of her pampers dah tak boleh fit dah masuk S oh ya I don't know whether you know kasi baby punya susu macam mana like how the increase right but I read at the tin kan eight weeks to twelve weeks sekarang kena kasi hundred fifty seh
then I like hundred fifty hundred fifty is this full you know satu is it okay
then I like see because macam macam dia still small seh abeh lepas tu kasi hundred fifty I feel like macam
tummy dia not that big what that time kasi ninety dah muntah-muntah aku kalau kasi semalam macam buat hundred twenty she never even finish she drink like fifty jer
that's why I say hundred fifty is the current it's the now right now nak kena buat hundred fifty then hundred twenty pun dia tak tak minum habis macam mana
first month pun kita kasi ninety jer tak kasi hundred twenty ya that one I know dia boleh reach that kind until that amount
ya because I'm worried that it's too much for her but then when I read the ikut the tin punya instructions eh because ah this week eh next week wait ah two more days she'll be eight weeks already so eight to twelve weeks is hundred fifty then I like shock seh macam huh why skip hundred twenty then suddenly hundred fifty apa seh
hundred twenty ah so now cause last time when she drink dia tak tak minum banyak kan macam dia tak habis ninety right I will start doing sixty so now if dia tak habis hundred twenty I will do ninety cause she has to increase apa she cannot stay sixty ninety she needs to go up to ninety hundred twenty okay we gonna drink like that untuk you okay
I'm going to make like that if not you tak habis susu wasted wasted wasted
masih ah daripada semalam does it really look swollen ya slightly ya slightly yes

so my school starts actually for now it's like um tengah holiday semester one holiday then semester two starts like
october nineteen tu pun now is just only like semester one jer belum semester two then like it's still like year one so
macam I feel like year one ni lama gila
ya my friends also like nak ajak hang out also my friend you know sarah
she ada club so she sarah and nasrul ni uh both of them is club is school of applied science punya
ah is more like your own course habis is more of like leadership punya kind of
then um tak salah
sarah have like err apa ni event ah for their um for their so she's the one that like macam like overall in charge
so ada ada um ada ada groups yang kena buat event tu one is her group kena pilih another one is another group tapi nashrul punya group like um tak kena chosen and after like she's very busy with her club
until I don't know I think until next two week then after that next two week baru like we
I also have my own tapi tak apa lagi pasal malas
ya pasal malas
honestly I respect those people yang macam dia orang sudah like for two years
and then doing the same thing that budak poly buat then having to go through the same thing like for another three years kat poly it's just so tiring and exhausting ah that's why sometimes I actually understand for those people yang
selepas they choose to just work
apa ni uh studying in poly because it's very tiring honestly
poly kan macam also is like poly so like I feel like macam ni poly example I take it as eh having to do it for another three years it's just no I am not like
it's not like macam easy you know like for those people who really like um
buat the assignments the project the presentation having to do it the same thing all over again in poly is
salute those people who macam have the determination like and motivation to like just continue going to um poly ya
phase is just um submitting your diploma ranking course lah kalau your interview is fail then like for my friend sarah kan dia dapat interview so dia pass interview and then she already get her what ah her results that like she can go in like like her place for
um pharmaceutical science memang sudah chop chop for her so macam okay lah she sudah selamat she don't have to like focus on her grades you know because dia memang can already it's like
so macam kalau interview sudah pass then okay you can go doesn't have to look at your and all lah
but for me because my interview tak dapat
now focus solely on which is uh kita orang pasal kita orang tak ada exam also so they look
over um they oversee our daily grades for each module and each day macam for us kan ada orang like
um sekolah dia orang satu hari is like is combination of subjects but for me is like kalau math is
then after that kalau there's a mixture of A and B is banyak and like the A and B is a lot then after that your confirm like high is like um three to four
gitu then kalau macam C banyak gitu then maybe around two point five to three point five gitu then um
like baru berapa compared to my other two friend I think they did more better lah in a sense
my diploma ranking course also I put first as biomedical science and pharmaceutical and biotech memang nak try dapat biomed if like if cannot also I would go for pharmaceutical science like it's okay for me but my my other friend my one of my classmates which is
jordan dia like
dia like mati-mati nak biomedical science jer like he go to common science program solely for that course but the thing is if he works hard for it
but the thing he tak put in effort and expect to get that course which is doesn't make sense lah cause a lot of like biomedical science is a course where it has like a high competition you know a lot of people want to join in because of the jobs they offer and all
biology also tak pernah dapat A
A susah nak dapat then it's mostly like B and C so if you want to go bio biomed also like you have to study really hard lah cause it's the um they focus um on biology the most
so like this semester tak ada exam so I next semester ada exam
still haven't to the point where I want to give up and all still okay pasal assignment dia pun is
tak banyak like is mostly more for lab practices and safety assignment then for the rest is like after you done for the day kan like through read virtually like other then after that um
habis ada quiz juga that you have to do like you have to submit before twelve
then the practice question is like biasa macam homework gitu
mostly banyak presentation but it's good lah
because like prepare you for the future cause confirm um when you enter working life there's a lot of presentation you have to do so I feel like other advantages and disadvantages disadvantages pasal like I think you will feel like
kalau I memorise I think I can say it confidently but somehow if like impromptu kan is just like my weakness like
then pasal presentation the
presentation was okay as times goes by then macam
senang lah but because they will give us like a problem statement and then that problem statement we have to solve it with a powerpoint slide like our answers and all like what we think what is our opinion on on this problem statement and then present it to the class but sometimes when you have like team mates yang
our lunch break is equals to our study break like our presentation punya tu
sometimes I'm like wow kita dah eighteen
like you know when I was in like primary school I always like admire those people with like secondary school near um uniforms so macam eh how is it feels like to be like old like kind of old lah then I was like
now that I'm like at that stage kan aku macam actually it's normal macam biasa like wow it's just normal lah honestly
and it's okay cause macam tak ada boyfriend kan it's okay lah macam we don't really take that into my mind macam oh like die die you
must have a boyfriend must have like someone by your side like keluar dates with you know I think
I don't really mind lah kalau I have a boyfriend or not as long as macam that is like um kawan dekat you know I think
relationship with your friends and family is already good enough for me pasal later so you like have studies and all by the time you're like busy and all your studies like take over your schedule and all so like there's
NAFA is like lah kirakan
like different people also like different lah honestly like um the things that they're prioritising and it's all like semua ada masing-masing lah hanya
cause in the future also if you want to get married and you want to start a family you wouldn't want your family to macam have a lot of worries like oh pasal duit and all that of course you want your family to be macam stable lah like in every um ya in everything you know
it's very hard lah like I feel like kalau family tak cannot like tak tak ada like stability and all that kan I feel like ah one day confirm will fall apart punya
and some more I also like the type of person yang tak message orang
like wow kalau dah malas dia punya malas is malas tak aku boleh like
for one week straight tak berbual-bual siapa-siapa cause like I'm that type of person ah
so macam ya I'm okay with actually single also is not bad
like sometimes also like after I break up kan macam wah like heartbreak this heartbreak gila babi you know like that kind
but then like wah like sekarang I'm like okay with it like I over it I'm like
but even though like there are times macam eh macam nak ada orang like to be by your side like a boyfriend lah okay kirakan like cakap good nights and good mornings all but then still I think
kita boleh get over it lah there's just like moments where we really like want to have that someone that kind you know
so like sometimes kalau oh ada family gathering kan it's nice like to talk about our own life like just joke around about something ah even my sister like
like uh video call her friends during ah apa ni I'm having a dinner so I I feel like macam like in like
you will need to have like some privacy you know it's not like okay lah kalau ada kawan tu okay but then like kalau it's time to like for your family you focus on your family jer tak mahu get mixed lah like video call with friends like
other time you can do what like kat sekolah pun jumpa kawan yang like jumpa kawan habis kat rumah also like kawan then like when are you going to like you know um
mm spend time with your family not really ya tak ada
wow I'm lucky to be in such a family kind punya vibes cause different family different ah ada family like focus um
solely on like spending time with families other families just like heck care you know but I feel like in the future kalau nak ada family I think I would like spent mostly like my time on families then kalau like my anak-anak macam ada boyfriend ke girlfriend ke aku macam nak bagi advice sikit
I got here lah so I mean initially we plan to meet pukul dua belas gitu but then I was a bit lazy so I was lazing at home so I went then I stayed then
I then I will just okay lah I want to naik basikal then now I'm regretting it lah
hot pun it's not tak panas sangat macam hari yang dah like the past few days it's not really that got lah but then I mean its a good time also now like three o'clock I cycle then forty five minutes to your place tak tak jauh sangat it's eleven kilometers
and the weather cuaca pun okay juga lah so I mean it's okay you got lah so I mean it's
I remembered I I need to refresh the the the mandatory law tapi dia cakap difficult if you doing exercise like any exercises running jogging cycling tak payah pakai mask pe
so I think when it comes to mask I wasn't very I mean I didn't wear a like a proper face mask yang kena and the one the government kasih atau the one that they government suruh lah
I just use the kain like the one the the they call it the kain untuk muka
with like good high speed then confirm things are gonna go to your face so it's like prevent ah barang-barang kena muka like some debris you just go to uh face what's that at least apa dia ada protection because if not like
deliveroo so like most of the time it's like cycling and it's like but the pathway is tempat kosong so I will I can just keep cycling at maybe higher speeds like
like I can compared to a car I mean not until forty kilometre lah maybe twenty ten kilometer per hour to cepat juga lah but then
then some more ada construction tempat construction so
so the tempat construction is just debris ah then the habuk-habuk masuk hidung then I was like my nose a bit itchy lah then I mean
okay ah then ya so that that was the time yang cause that one tempat dekat dengan forest forest sana because it's the ulu ulu tempat ulu sana so
by chance I wasn't wearing that face that that mask then ya lah err lalat masuk lah hidung
eh lalat masuk mulut
I mean literally it's not at house anymore lah dia dah dekat luar lah
eh ya dia masuk lah I mean
you are cycling penat-penat jauh it's like you are jauh then
you are breathing in you need a lot of oxygen so you I don't think you are gonna pakai mulut eh pakai your hidung ya it's kena use your pakai mulut lah you
then by chance the thing masuk and nasib tak masuk my the the air pipes it masuk my esophagus straightaway so I just telan
dia makan betul ah I also tak berak-berak so okay ah
sakit no ah it just
I think it's just extra protein ah I don't know apa dia makan kat that ulu area and I mean forest I mean housefly they flies are basically came from maggots what then then they evolve
so I don't know maybe there's something they rotten there then I'm just extra protein lah abeh some people confirm makan maggot what good
you want nak makan bat
currently I'm taking kat the the ubi sana lah I mean
I am like I mean cycling is a good thing ah like naik basikal if you exercise you go distance and if you work pakai kerja deliveroo or grabfood you earn money also then I mean but then I still schooling then I need transportation also lah like but I mean by motor also can work use for my grabfood and deliveroo also so I mean might as well I get a bike license lah bike license boleh tolong apa like like two in one so just settle everything
aku pun tak tahu but I I think depends lah I think now the the rate dia dah really drop dah jatuh so
cause I think now there's a influx dah banyak I mean cause of corona a lot of people lost their jobs so they also now kerja ah apply for foodpanda grabfood deliveroo
I mean I I mean I have a ada grabfood dengan foodpanda eh apa deliveroo account ah I don't really need dapat masuk joined foodpanda lah so I think
I those two is enough ah and then now also masih because I'm now masih like recently kena diagnosed dengan hyperthyroidism so my saya I just sakit sangat lah I just susah nak nak exercise so ya so I mean now I cut down ah just do less
I don't remember calling it docket uh I think the maybe dia orang it's a foodpanda punya benda ah pasal for apa grabfood dengan deliveroo they call it ah incentive so dapat incentive like you deliver ten ah
thirty forty dollars that was itu pun only for
peak period like friday to sunday but then friday to sunday also you are not the one kerja lah the orang lain semua kerja kerja so you are challenging others people I mean not challenging you are like
competing competing orang-orang lain semua ah so
that is grabfood lah for for deliveroo incentive punya ada every deliveroo every delivery for for peak is extra maybe one dollar to two dollar so the good thing for grab for deliveroo is I mean
like you in a in a pickle you just call jer nanti they just will assist you ah tolong just tolong you like just like that grabfood you call sampai besok pun dia orang tak angkat
oh ya ya depends lah kalau dia orang nak kasih tip dia orang nak kasih tip ah I mean in singapore I mean singapore culture itself tak ada tip culture what it's like sometime also there are people
you'll give tip nanti dia orang fikir eh ini aku dah buat dah dapat kerja duit ni apa pasal dia kasih duit lebih ni apa aku buat ni like they are thinking that's like something wrong but then is in the end they just wanna tip so i's a singapore it's not not a tipping
ya they give ten dollar I tip just kasih ah
ya they give I mean because the tip you can just give it through app atau the cash so they will just give you cash ah like from singapore's tipping
food their tipping like their the the person the company they ambil duit the the that it was supposed to tip but to you so it's like
rabak ah but singapore I mean they tip you you get the tip ah so that's what the company the company
well I mean because tak ada duit selalu no pocket no cash in the pocket so they tip using a card using the payment make payment pakai dia punya that account lah so ya so my biggest is paling banyak is ten dollar ah lah but now is they give me cash see me
looking cool then give me ten dollar lah itu dapat terus sepuluh dollar just just the just deliver and it was a tempat pun like also like legit
cause it was a big so basically tempat dia is like depan depan rumah dia tempat makanan then he just like maybe
fifty meter and lima puluh meter jer I go down take food go up
and that really the delivery fee like what I got is already seven dollar then this add add of a ten dollar dia orang kasih then I got seventeen dollars I guess just for fifty meter pergi angkat itu jer
been a long time ago lah like dah lama juga ah I've gained back the empat ratus tu so
like four empat about four hundred is still a good price for a good bike that is like
with the accessories ah barang like
it's err I mean you want to do something you on the road ride bicycle also or pavement you want something that you can rely on you you pakai benda yang murah-murah terus benda rosak yang mati pun kalau apa-apa jadi pun it's you what
the thing is sometime pun orang like you rider you will sometimes take naik basikal you I mean then you anything happen like then eh guai lan padahal sometimes you forget eh your your means your safety first lah you don't even remember you like you just wanna get that money but then you lupa about yourself lah so it's quite stupid ah sometimes like you
we are paid by duit apa by by by time so the time you cepat you get more money so kadang-kadang tak pakai otak nampak tu green green light belum green light tu showing but you want nak to go you want to go
ya lah so safety also have to come first ah because you are doing this thing like even like for me I take bicycle more high risk lah but then better I can go in to the like where the pedestrian jalan jalan lah so like senang
then then compared to bicycle ya but then you I since I can go two in one go to the road and pergi the pedestrian pathway tapi
kadang-kadang pun singapore drivers
memang semacam ah
err talking about check back blind spot tadi on the way here already I was I was really know I was
like busy but I'm not crossing on the zebra crossing I'm like walking on um from the main road going straight so dia dari the the the other side nak masuk the main road from the zebra crossing ah the junction so the
the driver dia tak nampak ah I like I was really prepared to break from jauh but I was already dah macam dah nak
I was really like to be beside her in that main road dia just jam break ah then ya I will I will initially I already jam break first
cause a he she right I don't see her like dia not stopping so ya she so I think I might fail her ah
I mean not my problem also I like legit I was already on the road I'm wearing blue colour boleh nampak apa dari jauh then like there was a car like
I was with I'm already maintaining my speed and never slowed down she just didn't tak ternampak tak nampak so I mean I was I already my two hands really prepared on to you break ah
so she just she jam break herself ah then just I hear dia cakap sorry sorry sorry but I don't think it's got that sorry you cannot help her lah
oh ya err so sekarang I'm taking my bike license lah like I mean as a someone who I think honestly as a
I mean it's a good thing for a license lah you easy save best like for demonstration but then I think when it comes to you are dari the cyclists ah you are like basically the food chain ah kat bawah sekali
ah tahu mana bodoh bodoh yang macam basikal orang bodoh
ya like I think then I think the instructor pun cakap you because some people dah dia dah ada three A license of the three class three three license
then they dia orang nak ambil class two B then they then I think they instructor pun cakap ah you now okay now you guys are from start from car now you but sekarang nak nak naik motor then now you know orang motor apa yang jadi so just now I was doing practical lah I did revision but then I think what reason siang sangat because
like cepat sangat ah because I haven't booked my prac six yet overnight to go out on the road
uh prac five is the revision dah I mean it's the internal cost lah but I already cleared that just that I did revision because dah lama tak naik motor
six kat luar
oh you mean keluar from the to the main road ah yes I that one I can see beside because whenever I go there I also naik basikal so I can see apa yang or like what's happening ah kata orang too happening sia I also macam takut ah nak nak nak nak keluar that main road just to naik basikal
I because I choose ubi pasal pun like dekat dengan basikal so I think I I mean naik basikal sana okay lah I don't want to naik basikal every time go pevery time go
I mean aku pun don't mind lah kena ride on some something ride on me but
depends lah so I mean every time I mean cycling far okay lah once in a while occasion so like how aku naik naik basikal sini to to here then also I need to go back naik basikal so depends lah but then nak every time nak take lessons no thanks ah
I will just take public but then now pasal nak dekat so I naik basikal to jer lah
dua puluh enam dua puluh enam the practical like depends lah kadang-kadang in the evening that is twenty eight ya but then ya when it comes to outside the road then it's it's like ten dollar extra so
I mean basikal pun okay for exercise like I mean comes to dapat motor pun okay lah you
like for transportation because now also tengah like belajar pun like easy lah like boleh bangun lambat sikit nak pergi sekolah dari bangun cepat-cepat abeh terus naik public abeh public tempat penuh sangat then you cannot sit down terus macam
I don't know lah I think when it comes to transport singapore it's always macam
I I I don't know lah macam ada ada hantu dekat dalam orang-orang dah mati dulu-dulu punya perang cari balik
singapore I rasa lah I don't know every time it's like damn haunted start the singapore transport for the I mean the buses everything is err I mean reliable just that I don't know why ah
I was I rasa kubur-kubur dan kena you dug up the kubur then underground then hantu dah semua datang
is it I don't remember I don't I don't no the bike kat sana is one sixty
I don't know ah I want to jimat duit pun okay lah but then I want to nak like I mean nak nampak handsome sikit ah so
tak handsome sangat lah
ya like ah muka aku pun buruk sangat so kalau pun tak tak boleh tolong tapi at least kalau at least I from a seven maybe masuk naik atas ke nine ke eight ke all over there ah
you pandai juga eh motor kau
I think when I think kalau nak beli motor pun I'm gonna buy I think buy maybe uh as a second second owner ah not gonna buy until dah nak habis maybe maybe
kalau ada duit of course obviously I will buy ah like a first hand but I think I still need to figure out ah like
like usually when it comes to like my future career I don't think motorbike is a good thing ah macam like that's because I would be macam jauh away from singapore ya like for enam bulan so I think see how first lah
ya like I mean that's the that's the one thing lah ada ada datang balik terus the tyre hilang tinggal handlebar jer kat sana but park kat carpark tinggal handlebar I mean obviously there's one thing lah but
ah I so that's why I need to see first most probably tengok lah most probably I just comeback
then uh I think most probably I will still nak ambil class three three license lah I mean
I mean we err like uh nak buat family cannot be bringing your child kalau ada child naik naik naik motor pe I means still can lah but then like cannot lah like but singapore I mean were asking if want to naik naik bus pe public but then
like when it comes to reliability macam barang-barang selalu breakdown you think you can trust can you trust singapore government
aiya I think that one too vague lah like everything can be improve lah semua benda boleh boleh improve pe ada benda merepek pun boleh improve
so tengok lah like I don't know I mean sometimes you cannot rely on wanting too much ah nanti benda problem nanti then you are relying that thing benda rosak then you are
so pandai-pandai ah so that one also cannot rely too much lah
oh ya so I've been talking so I think maybe like your turn ah berbual for I mean this conversation we are having so
which um the surprise yang paling besar yang orang like give like give you like you have a shock of your life
oh so like ah okay okay so duduk lama-lama then suddenly you just don't know either dia orang datang so they put your car then what happen next
so we basically dah kereta you just waiting waiting then dia orang dah sampai tempat pick me pick spot then they just like
so they already park lah so then after that dia orang nak bawa to the place to eat lah so and so tempat makan dia at where exactly
okay now let's understand so siapa like you who siapa who was there like siapa kat sana semua like is it your all your soccer mates ah is it just them or ada orang lain celebrating
okay lah I mean ya I mean the also quite gerek lah but then like I mean
I think it's a good way to celebrate birthday ah orang like you are with lah people you love orang kalau kawan help your family depends like everyone like ada orang macam nak celebrate birthday they just want to celebrate themselves tak nak orang involved
everybody orang celebrate differently ah so I think it's good lah like you know what you want like you how you want to celebrate and that's and your friends you know that's how you want ah ada some people you want to celebrate they will they think that invite invite dia padahal dia tak nak celebrate they are just nak lepak kat rumah
nak tidur tu jer so I think I mean it's good that your friends you know what exactly like you want ah
just kasih duit jer I I happy don't really need to buy me stuff ah I think like ah you give me duit I I can spend myself you give me a voucher kat also I happy dapat beli beli makanan makanan biskut ke apa kat rumah
so I think that will be is enough untuk like for me lah tapi
I mean it's good lah you like your friends chip in everything for barang-barang for you
right your your this celebration is quite I mean quite interesting lah like like it's like it's very it's a very like emotional roller coaster ride you like you are shocked don't know what the heck you are eh apa like what is happening and like
tengah buat apa ni what they doing sia you are dalam dalam hati is just takut tapi it's like excited like to find out
ya like I say ah duit vouchers are a good thing ah like I think like you know I mean they're doing it
for your friend or you like just orang just acquaintances you just tanya the mutual friend like eh apa dia suka ah like like like the person's hobby like for example like you know this person like likes to apa
pergi shopping rather you maybe buy a like get err voucher from zalora or something as long as I don't know I I also tak shopping banyak sangat
and ya I think the typical barang for guy is orang kasih apa eh kasih those perfume I guess the the they demo apa lagi uh they don't call it perfume dia orang panggil apa eh oh cologne ah cologne but I mean
I don't know lah jangan nak nak step atas cakap perfume sudah lah for me lah okay but
err tapi ya I mean for guys I think
ya the the best the most easiest I guess is a watch lah like senang ah unless orang dia macam those uh yang benda benda the all the watches dia dah dah dah ada rolex all the thingy thing then you then you just
alter course lah tak payah fikir pasal tu
even grand but then orang orang orang siapa seh ni aku tak berbual then terus it's like
it's like err it's like eh ah like awkward lah you cannot be yourself like you are they because they is grand lah so so orang kalau fikir okay invite orang lebih lebih padahal you want grand but then the people that you want that can be yourself tak payah tak payah no need to hide your personality gitu
okay that is I mean birthdays lah but then it's like I mean to me you fikir fikir birthday
what are you celebrating like the person's life like celebration like apa that has been going on on his life or like petty celebration of the I mean let's celebrate the longevity of the the person lah dah dah dah tua dah lama or you want to like celebrate whatever the person
okay whatever you said that one orang terlalu fikir jauh sangat like you I mean like birthday birthday ah
tak payah nak mm susah sangat like what you said kalau orang nak book tempat pun as a as an example kalau the person birthday is on the december you want to book which hotel thirty first december orang orang confirm like it's gonna be fully book lah so it's gonna be problematic
so like I mean ya lah there are some people want to have the most grandest birthday nak barang-barang semua yang bagus ah like I mean for a celebration lah it's like it's a once in a lifetime
I mean birthdays ah once in a lifetime ah you can you are gonna be that age for once only uh unless err I don't know percaya reincarnation that one different topic lah
okay uh uh ya I guess that's susah ah tapi I think dah nak they by their by their age
jauh lah like plan ahead very far like for example birthday twenty fifth december ah then you have to book very early but then
banyak banyak hotel pun nak book is quite hard must be nearer to the date then it's be very very hard lah pasal you're not the one like celebrating an occasion some people are like christmas where or whatever else they are celebrating ah
okay lah ya I mean ya lah I mean going overseas also for a holiday or a birthday trip but then ya lah COVID sekarang buat everything susah even
not even just nak keluar holiday like nak keluar untuk kerja overseas is like the deployment kat overseas is orang semua susah susah is like now everybody kena in singapore like thinking
like they're like whether this apa apa this career dia orang tengah buat is on hold pasal of a pandemic so it's like it's a big talking point lah not just birthdays ah so like all other like holidays or even like work ah kerja kerja critical this is a it's like a
a good err thing that is I I I think like it's a good thing that is happened lah so like orang can just reflect is this a good like like it's like reflect ah like in the future is this ah like like you have to have a contingency plan ahead jauh jauh lain ah
I mean the furthest I went paling jauh is U like the I went to that was bila kecil-kecil ah los angeles that was during winter I was I was only like four years old so I don't really remember apa yang I did
I mean it helps lah you you got you like you already plan lah nak pergi okay okay I want aku nak pergi jepun so I want to like at least belajar a bit a bit of keep like a keywords like
taberu makan like like all those ah keyword like taberu makan and ah coco desuka like ni nak pergi err like go where nak pergi mana go where some something like that lah so I think and when it comes to
food like what you say halal okay ya it's very hard lah nak cari makan makanan halal but then
I mean yang the big staple food there is you can just I mean minta so I guess ikan sushi nasi and one
I mean hokkaido no the highest I've been of in like the altitude is I think is only yokohama that eh no oh no tokyo is lagi tinggi dari yokohama so no that's the highest I've been is to tokyo so but
I think hokkaido tempat tempatnya ya is I mean from what we know as been advertise that their whole their what they're known for is
their I guess their ice cream and stuff ah benda-benda cream is usually benda-benda yang sejuk-sejuk I mean that that that latitude tinggi-tinggi pun memang understandable lah so ya I mean hokkaido is when it comes to makanan tempat benda sejuk lah dessert
I think it's not also just that lah I mean you also tempat
where there their place is like like even like you can say the japanese also dia orang pun cantik juga I mean their complexion is there tempat pasal there tempat sejuk if it's cold then you don't really sweat much tempat so it depends ah
I mean that's understandable lah you see orang-orang yang mat salleh orang those memang the further north
but the percentage point tak tinggi sangat lah so it's ya lah I mean that is all geography geographical location which is depends ah
honestly I think it's a waste of money orang like I think singaporeans is always
they have a or like they call it fomo fear of missing out it's like it's just takut eh orang also pergi then I never pergi it's like I cannot talk about it sial berbual abeh then they just they don't they just want to go just for just to make sure people know that dia orang dah pergi so that can talk
this is a this six hundred like what you say is a lot untuk nak anuh dah just for a very premium dining experience which is I think it's quite I don't know for me quite merepek ah orang nak belanja then up to them
kaunye favourite drama apa
boleh macam-macam ah I mean you can go korea korean drama
actually aku tak tahu like legit
eh tapi I mean like you always tengok ni apa
so what you macam you punya favourite drama
oh jadi kau most of the time tengok yang variety show ah
aku rasa is tujuh hari
okay apa cerita dia
bedek ah
aku sekolah then
ah yes kita semua more of like
itu actually rabak gila seh
betul betul I mean kita tengok
kita selalu tengok I think YouTube
yes ada dia punya timing serious gila
that's my macam go to err
it's the it's the only time that I baca surat khabar
a'ah betul kau habis cerita kau
aku kat tepi tengok aje dah habis belum
langgar tak timing dia
thailand drama not for me I mean aku tak tengok sangat thailand drama
yang macam comedy movie because they quite funny ah
aku tahu lah I mean
so obvious cam dia ada adam apple and
ada like they very tall for guys dia punya features macam very tall then very rough hands
that's macam
dia punya telltale sign ah
now now because of surgery also susah nak apa tu nak err nak bezakan lelaki ngan perempuan you can lacking of open you know you know
oh ya actually aku tengok juga kat Facebook that one oh my god like really look like ya really look like a woman
that that's the dangerous part kau imagine eh kau imagine macam
uh aku tak tahu aku bawa balik ni
uh oh my god aku tak boleh imagine aku tak boleh kau imagine reaction ayah ngan mak
tapi long distance relationship apa
dia kat singapore abeh perempuan tu kat malaysia
so they just communicate by ni ah cam telephone ah like just call
boring pe kalau tak nampak
ya long distance relationship susah
tak ah I mean I got see like couple of my friends macam they take uh long distance relationship kan then it never work out
tak lah banyak perempuan tinggalkan lelaki
a'ah legit kau tengok ah boys to men kan
it's not a norm tapi macam it's a thing
I don't know the period ah I mean dua tahun apa I's quite long dua tahun
like you nowadays very susah ah nak dapat
ah dapat yang baik
more of like a kampung kampung area I mean that's quite good
kalau future wife I will look for if she macam religious
ah religious um pandai masak
pandai masak is important yes I know I know you I know you don't know how to cook but it's a fact kakak you nak kena tengok dia punya
oh ada banyak lah I mean um looks looks kalau looks wise kan aku tak macam
tak tak kesah sangat ah boleh cakap
ya I mean looks nowadays kan kau tengok eh looks doesn't matter lah for me looks doesn't matter but most of the time guys go for looks ah which pada aku is just uh
which pada aku is just uh not a good thing it can lead you to I'm not a good thing I mean it can lead you to macam
bukan aku cakap not all aku tak cakap yang all beautiful ladies
perempuan lawa is basically jahat ah tapi
kalau katakan eh like ninety per cent
kalau from my point of view lah aku tengok dia ni lawa tapi oh dia buat kawan aku macam gini oh
it give you macam a thought ah macam so perempuan lawa macam gini ah
like my like nowadays it's more of kita judge the book by its cover kan
I mean you can judge a person based on dia punya personality first tapi sekarang most of the time they judge on looks
just because dia tak lawa eh dia ni macam gini ah dia ni macam gitu abeh kalau dia lawa dia ni macam gini dia ni macam gitu
last time is more macam they understand each other like
macam mak ngan ayah punya time is more ah wah aku suka dia K eh she's the one for me macam gitu like
like last time people is more of a macam loyal tau sekarang is more of K ah
ya attention kalau nak cakapkan they need attention ah
because now is kita living in a modern society tau so this modern society and singapore is quite strange to begin with faham
tu pasal ah
that's why they need attention as like macam uh pleasure
not uh pleasure ah macam how to say ah
kalau married couple for me kalau nak attention is very hard ah
tapi kalau nak cakap kan eh um
aku kahwin dia tapi dia tak kasi aku attention tapi kita ah macam you're not ah giving both
kau nak selalu cakap I need attention tapi you never see the point of view
as a married couple you need to understand a lot of things apa
no ah kalau nak cakapkan piece together all of it kan is susah juga pasal
sekarang is more like kita have different thoughts different feelings kita punya emotions all jumble up
jadi kita ah
and singapore eh kalau kau nak tahu eh singapore is rated one of the most depressing country in the world tau serious
because of the stress that macam kita put on ourselves just to survive every month
and singapore eh have the macam the highest divorce rate
mostly melayu lah tapi
it's very hard lah because nowadays more of like dia orang um
dia orang tak cuba fikir ke depan tau
they fikir okay macam orang putih cakap yolo eh
you only live once kan so they never think macam ah beyond horizon tau
dorang just fikir okay uh aku nak party ah all the way but dia nak kena fikir juga
end up you need to have a family you need to have a life a you need to have a career if not you're going macam downhill ah
so pada aku wise eh nak cakap sekarang punya zaman is more stress lah basically
tapi yang penting eh daripada drama boleh pergi marriage
I mean like is like macam uh a playhouse tau
kau boleh buat mistake tapi kau boleh buat mistake tapi it's uh it's scripted ya it can be soft because you're in the playhouse kan
aku ada tu aku ada tu thought tau eh what if I were to become this guy this rich guy
what if I apa kata kalau aku jadi dia ni aku jadi dia tu
macam oh but it's not going to happen ah it's just that kau ada dia punya thought ah tapi end up macam kau face reality ah basically susah gila
kalau nak cakapkan drama
drama is okay cakap-cakap scripted kan
tapi aku lebih suka macam reality show
kau suka variety show variety show is most likely buat macam games talkshow api aku lebih suka macam aku tak tahu ah kalau kau tengok shark tank
it's about macam got an entrepreneur tau
entrepreneur apa pula eh
oh uh macam kau businessman
kau businessman so kau nak jual kau punya idea
ask people to support you lah macam gitu beyond this five people ah
I mean these five people at the end will uh will macam cakap ah okay aku akan sponsor kau kalau tak semua cakap big no ah
ah one of them can sponsor you two of them can sponsor jadi it depends ah on idea bagus tak
it's not voting basically macam kau datang sana kau ada idea okay kau nak orang tolong kau pasal this five people they are very uh
uh their influence is big tau and their market is big also jadi kalau kau amik dengan dia orang kan you will gain a lot
jadi that's why they a lot of people go there actually tapi that's why I like reality show it's not scripted
bondi rescue apa
kau jadi lifeguard
macam ni eh bay watch
so basically kau suka more of like cerita yang berkenaan dengan
kalau in-laws bukan adik ipar itu mertua
um brother in-law abang ipar
oh my melayu
so by the time the lifeguard actually masuk laut tu balik kan this couple dah face down
lemas ah drowning ah
abeh lifeguard tu macam sedih ah macam eh
tapi it's not their fault apa they they it's their job it's their job tapi
kadang-kadang it's not meant to be ah it's not meant to be
it's macam aku boleh cakap kan this world eh is scripted
macam K you cannot predict this one you cannot predict that one but like only god know lah macam
tuhan aje tahu when is your ajal when is your this one when is your that one
so you cannot predict ah if they are meant to die that means K ah mungkin diorang pergi somewhere better lah
oh macam err
it's ah macam mouth to mouth ah
oh that penat gila actually that one is very penat
diorang try to keep their emotion macam in check ah
it's like macam kau tahu cerita yang dulu kita masuk adam khoo workshop
pasal seratus orang dalam trap dalam bottle
abeh diorang work together just to save this one person's life
it's yang diorang actually got no where to go tapi dah ada this high macam it's a escape route escape route eh
so diorang ah cakap okay that means mungkin korang satu orang pergi keluar panggil orang datang
so diorang panggil budak ni ah budak ni pasal
it's not pasal ringan he's the
it's budak kan they they are all adults ah
kan is they kesiankan K so they so okay kau pergi panggil orang tolong kita I think about seratus orang gitu ah they all stack onto one another
then uh pangku yang budak tu ke atas then
then diorang pergi dia dapat escape ah budak tu
abeh bila dia datang balik dengan pertolongan eh it's too late
like the ninety nine people dekat botol tu kan died
that's macam gitu lah
they cannot save ya they cannot save everyone but it's great ah macam diorangnya job
guilty conscience ah betul
tak salah north depan south belakang
east kanan west kiri

ya yang K yang ini untuk makanan jer ni memang khas untuk makanan jer channel ni dia takde post apa-apa lagi selain makanan jer orang makan because pasal kalau umi buat satu channel umi tak boleh campur-campur
pasal kadang-kadang orang suka tengok ngaji tengok ngaji jer you know what I mean umi kalau nak umi tak nak kalau selain melainkan kalau umi dato aliff ke dato vida nak tunjuk kehidupan takde orang kisah pasal umi kehidupan
so kalau umi nak buat channel umi buat satu satu topic tu satu niche umi boleh buat macam kesihatan ada orang buat macam err buat duit anything lah okay lah okay contoh eh contoh contoh let's just pakai contoh orang lain
okay um kita tengok channel channel orang lain eh kita tengok berapa banyak dia buat okay contoh um channel siapa siapa yang ustaz ustaz apa ustaz kazim
kazim kan kasim ke kazim eh okay ustaz kazim kazim okay um
ustaz kazim okay lah tak tahu nama dia siapa how to spell

okay jap eh kita tengok dia ada lima puluh ribu juta view gitu dia punya langganan ada lapan ratus umi umi check umi punya recording is it still masih record
okay lapan ratus enam puluh satu ribu kan subscriber
okay okay lah ni ni anggaran jer dia buat dalam three point two K per month okay tapi the thing is benda ni kadang-kadang dia anggarkan jer it might not be true macam sometimes dia boleh buat lagi banyak lah you don't know okay lah let's tengok macam channel um celebrity eh
siapa ah siapa yang buat channel err okay lah aliff aliff syukri okay dia suka buat youtube kan
okay jer bonda rozita
um ni bumi ratu channel okay ni jer
okay dia buat dalam empat ribu lima ribu lah okay per month
ya ini channel dia okay dia pun channel dia um bonda whatever

aliff aliff boleh kita boleh cakap crack lah umi tak kisah
dia orang tak tahu okay not
okay err kan dia okay terlajak laris ni dia banyak tau dia punya
okay dia dia punya video banyak okay tengok eh dia punya langganan langganan berapa okay satu point empat satu juta okay dia punya upload dah seribu lebih ah video dia dia dia naik kan okay um and then dia punya view dah banyak dia tiga ratus lebih pasal dato aliff ni dulu dia bila dia start tak banyak orang tengok lama-lama kan banyak orang tengok jadi
okay dia daripada malaysia okay um dia punya okay estimated dia punya anggaran dia sepuluh ribu lebih okay
ya sebulan yes so kalau convert sana tiga puluh ribu ya ringgit lah tiga puluh ribu ringgit so this is
I mean ni bukan dia punya ni salah satu stream untuk salah satu apa tu dia punya periuk nasi ni bukan dia punya main source dia ada business dia this is just untuk marketing jer buat this is channel is untuk marketing dia okay
umi buat ngaji lah I'm doing this I'm doing this for your ngaji no lah remember I take video for your masak that one I haven't upload yet
that one is okay kalau kalau masak boleh taruh lah cuma um tak kalau nak ramai orang tengok I don't know lah maybe like very slow lah kalau nak cepat tak boleh cepat lah kena macam perlahan-perlahan upload upload lama-lama they will increase dia punya views
pasal sekarang kan umi nak buat kan untuk umi ngaji that's why suruh umi buat ngaji punya you ajar tajwid like macam satu video tu dua tiga minute you berbual pasal qalqalah
qalqalah then you give like contoh ayat
okay then you okay ni episodenya okay ni dah okay ni lepas qalqalah you cakap maybe hukum lain lah I don't know hukum lain untuk tajwid okay episode ni dah berakhir kita jumpa lagi pada episode seterusnya gitu something like that um
ya but kalau umi buat ni umi kena consistent lah umi tak boleh buat macam
ngaji okay kalau umi nak orang orang tengok umi kan orang kena macam cari umi punya channel pasal umi nak belajar sesuatu dulu kalau umi dah misal kata umi dah banyak buat video nanti kalau umi nak ngaji later later boleh ah tapi sekarang I think better you buat macam video yang
um boleh
boleh juga tapi ngaji um
kalau umi belajar tajwid is tajwid is better lah
lagi bagus umi boleh ajar tajwid dulu ngaji nanti lah nanti because ngaji you know banyak orang lain pun boleh ngaji kan I mean it's on they got all the sheikh sheikh all to ngaji whatever then ngaji can can but not now lah now we focus on your tajwid first or your iqra
ya boleh mm ajar tajwid then maybe umi boleh also ada lagi satu series untuk orang yang baru baru nak mengaji ajar iqra macam ajar dia apa huruf huruf hijayyiyah all that
lepas tu ya lah that that's what you can do and then you can do a lot of things

before the real sem year two starts end up year two starts abeh kita orang tak main benda pun
what happened kau gi japan kan

pendek sia satu minggu
maybe it's just dorangnya tempat like the

so one is dua orang
then the other two is like seven seven dekat jer I know one is thailand
macam kalau dapat bagus ah
is the is the duit
pun ada cover so okay ah
tapi like circuit breaker tak boleh keluar rumah pun private how to say
kat rumah masak jer
I still go out quite a couple of time lah pasal kerja
apa eh aku masak
like the only memory I have is aku punya adik tiba-tiba cakap nak
buat macaron macam
as for me aku ada bake ah I still got bake at home with my nenek
tapi aku punya adik like don't really bake abeh tiba-tiba you want to start then you start with the hardest thing you can think of aku ingat siapa punya birthday eh aku punya maknya birthday eh
then macam dia nya plan macam fail tau dorang buat macam first batch macam tak jadi
then uh simpan dalam fridge sekejap
abeh second batch pun macam tak jadi
the capsule ah ya that one susah
like the apa ni dia nya height
abeh then you need to like coat it
oh a'ah korang exam
okay ah tapi like the past mm dua minggu tiga minggu macam kat rumah kat dalam bilik macam
dekat mana eh dekat rumah chloe eh
alah dorang dua neighbour
aku pergi sana end up aku masak mac and cheese
abeh dorang tiga tengah sibuk dengan dorang punya coffee
susah kan
tak tahu cukup bro
like I didn't cook a lot macam I cook a bit just for myself just to see apa ni
whether it's good or not lah like the combination tapi macam all four macam not that
berapa banyak then the low heat
tapi yang actually susah singapore mac and cheese is the type of cheese
the slice punya ah abeh the third one I went to
aku tak ingat ah aku beli Cold Storage kat kedai tu ah yang Cold Storage yang Fairprice Finest tu
dia ada aku beli jer ah
confirm I cannot remember nya
korang masak like during is like not really
masakan melayu kind
so that time I tried my nenek then I just ask
what was it ah some sambal
can't remember I think was like ayam masak merah
then end up the only thing yang aku ingat kan is like there already aku masak tom yum nasi goreng tom yum seh
like korang korang masak is like
like ikut measurement berapa sudu all those kind of thing
then when my nenek masak then she ajar right then she just like oh ambil sikit ambil sikit ni ni ambil lagi banyak abeh ni lagi sikit then I macam stress sia I don't even remember what is sikit what is banyak
that's why part ramadhan susah nak masak
so end up macam nak masak sayur pun depends on the age of the sayur that kind of hing
Gegar Vaganza is the one show that all the orang tua tengok
I don't know lah my datuk nenek always watching lah
but is not macam it's not macam Singapore Idol like they get new people then they is like talent is more of like already existing
ya like bring back the last time lah like hady mirza menang pe Gegar Vaganza that time
I never show you meh yang hady mirza nya
uh cinta luar biasa
okay later I show you then quite funny I saw dia nya starting that was his like second or third episode
then like he was saying he went back to Gegar Vaganza pasal like
that's why end up before that also dia buat macam
belum lagi early bro
then I will wait there duduk depan then dengan phone is like mana akid I just press record
ah dia nya kakaknya wedding ah
tak ada lah
cause dia nya cake was from my shop
aku ambil dia nya cake then I took Grab then I go there to her house ah
I think initially dorang buat they were looking at hotel tu semua
went on with it ah kat rumah but okay ah
okay lah but I never actually ask how much they spend that time aku punya kawan pun kahwin
then I think dia nya masak pun is dorang masak sendiri
dorang tak order cater tak I don't think is cater that wasn't cater pasal tak banyak orang datang
like they didn't invite a lot lah but then it's kat Zoom
then they like she invite kawan pun like secondary school just me and another person
then she invite like two of her poly friends dah tu jer then her bridesmaids lah
so it's like even as the bride herself dia tak invite banyak orang
okay ah but now banyak dorang
as in the company dorang buat is like cater hantar rumah pe
like the thing like that like that that time that mariam punya mak
with some you know the you remember the the the link that afiq sent to the silat group
about some gym bag yang you can sign up
tapi nak cakap apa eh
melayu aku err melayu aku melayu aku sekarang pun aku sekarang tiba-tiba tak boleh berbual
oh okay okay saya faham saya faham
it's just quite funny then wah my cat just manja like you know no tomorrow you know
okay but you know esok I tomorrow I have a meeting again
no not silat only I responded sia
cause I cause I'm reading the mail now apa
ya lah memang bukan main-main tapi afiq ada cakap pasal err kan syaz dapat kerja baru then syaz ah dia cakap macam aku boleh rasa afiq dah tak ikhlas sekarang
no tapi so aku tanya dia like kenapa dia err
okay so like I ask afiq like why he keep why does he keep holding this on macam for so long then he said that uh because syaz just got a new job then he doesn't want to err like ruin her spirit ah or something like that I don't know then I'm like that's damn that's damn bastard lah serious like damn bastard
I don't know I think they wanted to go out makan or something and then like they wanted to like because amar didn't want to be like so exclusive then he wanted to invite the two of us
because we have to keep we have to fill up the one hour usually when we talk we don't fill it up what it's like kita ada we have blanks you know
so amacam eh amacam so how
faham tapi itu so basikal bapa dia apa
ah takkan faz minta izin bapa dia habis bapa dia tak boleh ikut
ugh kenapa
apa yang okay
tapi kita nak berbual pasal apa eh
apa just just ini cakap nak berbual
apa yang kau merepek eh
eh kau punya melayu rabak juga eh
kau just just berhenti bercakap okay apa kamu
tapi aku dah lama tak berbual melayu macam gini ah so susah juga ah
kau nak kau nak kau asyik berbual bahasa baku jer that's why kekok
tercakap bahasa inggeris ah
memusnahkan recording ini recording dalam bahasa melayu apa
so kita sekarang tengah merakam pe
kenapa dah lama tahu bahasa melayu kan jadi macam gini
yang tertiba okay okay aku faham aku faham
err aku just tak faham ah kau nak cakap apa eh
dulu kita err apa eh
apa yang kau tengah berbual eh
ya allah susah
kenapa kau kena pakai saya awak ini ah
oh gitu
okay jadi kita nak berbual pasal apa sekarang
boleh juga lah kita buat gitu
kau asyik cakap benda just
kenapa eh
aku rasa tak ah
tapi sekarang ini kita speak in full sentences ke
ah okay ah macam gitu ah
dude your oh my god your malay sounds so kekok
kenapa eh
but macam mana you terkeluar Zoom
okay tak apa I I ajar you macam mana nak pakai Zoom dulu cause I use Zoom everyday so I'm quite
okay lepas tu kena sign in usually cause I'm under like my my account is under the under school so I punya sign in is just under sign in with tapi kalau you punya personal I would think you have to um sign in pakai
your own email lah tak okay but let's just pretend macam you ada your own email okay
okay so like selalunya when people ask you to join a meeting you will have they will macam send you a link kan then like from from the link you you just
select you can see like my background kat sini kan you it's apa um it's virtual screen so maknanya my background takleh nampak lah
kalau kalau messy kalau
so you can change like your virtual background ah at the bottom at the start of the video and then you can just pick choose virtual background so during class I selalu pakai virtual background cause belakang messy kan so I don't want to like show my background so kalau it's not the option is none it would be no virtual background
tak ni dah log in dah
so uh you can also add in your own photo so for me I macam I create I even created my own background just to
bagi lawa lah so I I use this
tapi kadang-kadang kalau pakai ni kan it's
so background is done and then um apa lagi nak tahu
okay so like for usually your share screen will be under here I think that it's the same for tablet dengan iPad I think ah ya
I'm not sure about um apa not android apa nama dia Windows punya laptop but
so kalau I pakai desktop kan
it will show like so even if I'm on Zoom and then I click open my WhatsApp punya web
ya but if I pakai if I choose the Google chrome punya kan
so even kalau macam I tengah pakai Google chrome lepas tu I open WhatsApp web
dia tak akan nampak I punya WhatsApp web
ya cause cause I choose only my my Google chrome punya err window
so like this would be hard macam uh once you share screen this will be your screen and then you can just toggle back to your Zoom I'm not sure about for for Mac I can just um
okay then another important is your mute button cause you know selalu macam
you selalu cakap then ya so muting sometimes even or when you whisper orang boleh dengar
and then it goes the same for the video lah kalau your video takde they will just show your name like this
ya then you just unmute usually for me dalam class I'll just unmute I I'll just mute myself
ni lah
tak yang tunjuk you tadi
she download on iPad and then after that whenever you download an app on your iPad dia akan tanya kalau you nak err apa
macam for privacy measures they will ask you to like allow allow camera allow microphone
ya yes so like for hers tadi um
so even kalau even kalau dia
so kalau you pakai video kan
uh apa nama dia
actually you can see yourself lah kat tepi
right so as long as you see your name it means that you are apa the video is done I mean the video is off
apa done
and then other basic things is like macam
raise up your hands or err apa
okay I don't really have it oh dengan yes no
okay so they will just ask oh ah who knows this question who knows the answer to this question raise your hands then you just angkat tangan
tapi angkat tangan takde kat sini lah
apa rename yourself so if let's say but you can only rename yourself you cannot rename for others unless you're the
so record is just you boleh tengok balik lah the recording
record on cloud means on your Zoom account which I which I prefer cause if you if you record macam macam that time I conduct my master classes right
macam movie gitu
find a way to upload that huge file to make sure everybody can see it then susah lah
ya then lepas tu I just um I tried out uh record on cloud
then orang akan just
ya orang akan be direct redirected back to the to the Zoom
chat ah okay cause ni tak ada participants sekarang kan so
mm then you know you can change err to everyone ataupun to a specific person
mm tak boleh
tapi kan ada orang cakap yang like what like the host who
ya so I don't know I don't know if it's true but just to be safe I don't like saying anything like nasty things about my lecturer kat dalam kelas lah ya
so make sure you bracket privately then when you send a message kan you have to make sure yang apa you you click back to everyone
tapi kan sometimes get confusing cause the messages your private messages and your messages uh your and messages apa to everyone
ya so you just have to macam baca betul-betul lah like which one is everyone which one is to you only
usually when I want to like ask my friends something then I'll just like click to apa to to my friend ah
breakout rooms is just uh macam tadi you experience that smaller rooms right so basically let's say you have a participant of macam
lepas tu orang tu nak breakout into smaller groups to do group work
macam create let's say two rooms
and then like as a host I will just break up the rooms but as a participant bila I tengah tengah tengok
cause for adults I don't think you guys pakai much like for meetings only right and during meetings also you don't really talk much like you let your boss
ya but like students we always have to tutorials then like when tutorials you have to talk to get participation marks apa
ya so if you like uh if you're a host then you can schedule meeting so like let's say macam I conduct my fundraising master classes kan the other time I will I will schedule a meeting and I'll just pick the time the date and then
mm I think it's better than apa what's the other option the outlook is it live live
but it's so susah just now
no but like but like what was your apa what were the activities that you do and everything
escape room ada virtual
I tak
I tak pernah pergi lah but like how so so what must you do in that escape room
cakap lah
apa it's the starting of the
I mean technically it's in the poem also what so like even if you baca like
but this is done by the escape room punya punya company lah
oh so like the facilitators like bought this escape room and then cause like they had you had a separate facilitator macam team bonding facilitator right
cause cause got my for my global studies punya apa
no it's like macam okay basically if it's physical kan in school then they will give you like nearing to exams lah macam your apa midterms or your final year then they will give you like err a literal goody bag
then inside macam ada foolscap ada snacks ada like ya then like all these are like
err apa get
promote ah sponsorship ah sponsorship ya so you ask for like you ask this company for sponsorship lah but usually like if it's a bigger scale like what like your whole faculty punya goody bag then it's usually easier but like for us cause we are just a small apa faculty group kan
in the end they were like okay we give you the sponsorship but um is to try out our apa
um room punya fee
they will ask you to get a certain number of people it's like a trial run dulu lah
tak tak tak kita play for free cause they just they just want to see if you can get the people or not
cause the main point of sponsorship is you nak orang uh you want to get as many attention as you want as much attention as much attention as you want what kan ya
you have to source out for the for the people lah but in the end we couldn't cause it was only for android punya phone
and then cause at first they tried to apa
E-vouchers for apa three different three different categories macam welfare eh welfare pula beauty uh food and macam activities lah like yoga and everything
but like the sponsorship rate was the the turnover the turnover was like just so low then in the end macam I think they just decided
ya so it's a bit sad cause we tried to macam we tried to
apa delays and everything a lot of the sponsorships tak reply cause COVID sekarang then even their organisations not doing well apa the companies not doing well
like even like activity punya entertainment places pun tak not
ya then now I just finished my fundraising punya series oh
ya then then even if four hundred dollars at first macam kita
we just like no confidence ah macam it's so susah
uh members in that EXCO group like he gave like constructive criticism lah he was like you you pass the target but then like a lot of people also macam donate in bulks what like you and mama
seventy per cent seventy per cent pula seven dollars out of like our total is still quite a lot what
just you sorang jer
apa embroidery the worst was makeup cause I think macam is so common like everybody can just watch YouTube tutorials
so so that one a bit but in the end err a lot of my EXCO just join in last minute so to the person teaching the makeup class macam it's not that bad lah ya
cause it was still macam ramai then she was like oh my god didn't expect this much this many people and then I'm like oh ha ha ha nasib baik cause there's only like
three people yang sign up ya and it was very no three three or four people yang sign up
from the faculty punya group
oh at first he I don't really know him but I just tahu pasal he lives in my for
not not like as close friends whatever it's more of acquaintance macam I saw his uh
I saw his poster inside the inside the lift the other time pasal
ah this excel course lah pastu I macam and I wanted to join that time tapi I had something on that day so I couldn't make it
I was dengan tengah planning for this fundraising I was thinking like hmm like what other interesting courses would people be interested in
then I thought macam I think
err apa
not hands-on macam very practical skills that people would need macam in their workplaces in their school right
he was just like ya sure sure lepas tu I I went to find out err he thought the class was like he was conducting the class for the somali refugees
then I was like no it's not then I was like oh my god so kesian then he was like no no it's fine I was like okay
dah I told him already but
two and half cause the maximum kita anuh is
actually I don't even know what's abang doing
like what what what did he macam in the end
oh bukan as in what is he selling like what kan dia
oh macam
macam GrabFood lah
so it's it's just plain rice chicken dengan just different sauce
mana seh
I don't know I just go novena untuk err skin centre
ya but the soft launch abang nak buat apa
but it's a a like you know like stall in in a food court ke in a
in a shopping mall ke
okay lah like atas atas punya food court cause I heard like there's apa
err pasal it's this semester is all online kan I didn't even step in school like for one moment
err go back to school to study apa
no at first cannot sekarang dah boleh
but jauh
you boleh tampines hub is the most not conducive environment ever
it's so bising you ever went there before
it's so bising like the there's a playground I mean if you go there like two that you know that kind of like hours like no more shops then okay lah understand but like
but it's not conducive and then people study like outside yang kat atas semua it's so hard
but like two hours macam so sikit if I want to study there
ya and then nak nak nak belajar kat luar pun
some establishments macam Coffee Bean they have no no laptop policy like cause they know a lot of people like going out to
tapi it's a take home so it's like twenty four hours
but that's the worst like I did that for my previous exam err my job punya module
cause they know we have twenty four hours and you have like the liberty to cam use all these
your laptop semua kan
even if you have friends macam
paiseh kan nak tanya
so it's usually like like apa a combination of err topics
very very little exam and then it's all replaced by assignments which I thought macam lebih lebih bagus ah
uh non exam modules and two exams pastu I macam happy lah yay three three modules no exam
ah ambil kau semua submission at the same time cause usually
if if you have two assignments or three assignments usually lah err the macam apa submission the deadline is
tak tahu kenapa lah but it's just like that ah
but the assignment like most of my assignments here um especially towards the end there will be this like one major like so all like consolidating nya assignment
ya so like let's say I have this refugee policy punya mod
my major apa
so you you bayangkan I have to do that and that's not my only module I have to do I have my other modules and top of modules I have readings to do readings which will help me in my modules
semua yes you see
twenty eight october eighteen october you see it's all like about the same sama-sama
macam now
ya the the amount of time you take to finish one essay right like you tak percaya you tanya kak shima the amount of time you take to finish one essay is like super long okay
there's the planning then you have to make sure like what you write is coherent you have to reference and then you have to find more sources that everything is so much easier to like just belajar for that one
uh like you belajar for certain period of time and then you just do exam for one day
I just got my I just go my apa
twenty third november baru end
then cause different assignments is different weightages apa
like like I think it's cause macam they don't want to people to know the bell curve also
mesti I macam huh
no but it's also like sometimes a a blessing I guess cause like you get like B B then like you work so hard on your last one then you don't know right so like when we dapat results you macam
lagi cepat stress
you naik year three year four it gets harder and harder what you have to take harder modules kan
I just want to macam freeze my lah so that it won't macam tak turun tak naik I mean I mean naik is possible it's very hard for you to naik lah honestly
ya tak turun lah basically
dorang nak tunggu vaccine
ya so like they were thinking if they like delay they hope there will be a vaccine that will come out already lah but unfortunately tak ada vaccine
ya then they they said but they will extend cause the application for the next round punya dah actually dah tutup
but then they just buka balik then they said oh it's until oh it's two more days actually the deadline the due date
then you said then they said you can apply but your just your application will just be like as though you're a new student so macam tak kira kalau you ada you were accepted like me like in your exchange you will still have to like
my major punya requirement is that
like in sem one and sem two consecutively cause it's like macam group work
okay so technically year four students you cannot go in your sem two so sem two is out lah I tak boleh pergi lah
mm so sem one but my course my my major ada this requirement that you kena ambil this particular module
like in sem one and sem two consecutively so kalau you miss out in sem one tak boleh ambil in sem two jer tau
two uh apa different modules from two different universities
and then after that time difference also cause it's it's like a macam group work gitu ya
ya which is why like we were we were okay we were okay with um just like err apa nama dia
uh doing online kalau boleh
if you are apa namanya I lost my train of thoughts already ayah keeps calling
no I mean it's it's actually calling your it's actually calling pula it's actually trying to like
take two different err from two different schools macam macam mana you you can attend two different schools like it's at the same time some more
I don't really have hope yang kita akan pergi lah cause it's ya it's quite hard
but they have to wait one whole semester for us to continue working again which is macam tak baik lah like who which which organisation is nice enough to do that
no kalau kalau
kalau one kalau one year then I won't lah like no and and it's not just them it's like
the faculty I mean my major macam just extra want to have this module to be different cause now we are like interdisciplinary module everything
but the the new application yang dorang kasi it's more
apa there's more options ah
kena submit lagi ah
if you submit you get accepted you can still reject apa and you and you won't
you've been looking forward to this but nasib baik I I stay in dorm if not like I really like no uni life at all
what takde
know like kak shima stay in the hall everything
what it what people are mad about is like macam the the college tak
they don't they don't dia tak relay apa-apa
only after two weeks they reported baru ada like
the laki lah
it took two weeks just to macam do something then that speaks a lot what
jap eh ada ayah ni apa apa ayah nak ni
jap jap and then after that like they and then we were like
and then like just cause of that even though like other sexual harassment activities happened in other universities like not much attention is placed on them just cause like like you know macam sensation lah like the media just wants to like keep on uh saying oh again
no but but in but kita punya people keep saying my uni right you know in other universities it's worst but but it just don't hear reports right
hi uh my name is rismah I'm eighteen years old this year and my birthday is coming so tolonglah belikan present ke apa ke
err lagi err
kebanyakan buah lah sebab err cause I like mango and
oval kot
ada yang oval ada yang bulat tergantung ah
tergantung buah dia nak grow macam mana
uh itu jer
itu jer kot sebab
betul lah kata err abang saya ini dia
ada yang bengkok ada yang straight
ada juga mango yang panjang kalau kau orang pernah nampak lah but then
itu jer
sebab mango ini kan it's very very sweet and
jangan cakaplah bila okay ah kadang uh nak makan mango ini ada kalau kau orang pernah lah
err kadang ada yang tersangkut dekat gigi lah
ada yang terselit dekat sana sini lah sebab kan dia orang punya apa itu
cause mango pun dia punya biji dia ada macam tali
so nanti dia orang terstuck dekat gigi ke apa ke but
other than that macam it's really really sweet and okay kalau kau orang nak tahu
cakap tadi yang ada colour
apa oren lah hijau lah merah lah kalau korang nak tahu um hijau is mango um mangga muda
um means uh mango yang masih belum masak lah and if you want to know the sweetest mango is the red mango
ah kalau kau orang nampak red mango itu lah mango paling sedap dalam dunia
so kenapa dia favourite sebab mango they're just relaxing they just
dia macam very juicy boleh buat juice and
oh banyak pun ada giant pun ada
ah cold storage pun banyak so
but macam macam ah nak cari mango ini dekat dingapore memang senang gila
so um jangan jangan apa
err pergi try lah I mean pergi try makan mango kalau siapa siapa yang tak suka makan mango pergi try confirm akan tambah lagi
mesti ada confirm because
so people will confirm keluarkan product product mango um like lip balm ke yang rasa mango
atau lipstick yang rasa mango kita mana tahu kan betul tak
lagi um
lagi err apa
mesti lah
mesti ada macam bingsu ada flavour mango
habis lepas itu um recently my friend bawa kan uh I
apa eh um I think it's a mango float I uh they call it mango float
so dalam pun ada mango and
every single dessert eh confirm for me ada mango punya
sebab kalau tak ada mango tak sah that's me okay kalau tak ada mango tak sah mesti ada mango punya kalau
tak ada mango tak nak makan
kan betul tak
ada diabetes uh diabetes ke it's also good for their health tahu kalau dia orang nak makan mango pun
sebab it's a fruit it's bukan makanan manis it's not too sweet it's not too bitter so
boleh uh mango ni boleh dimakan dari segi um budak dari budak budak sampai lah ke orang tua
and ya like I said it's very very healthy so kalau boleh kau orang makan lah mango and
mango ni colour dia yellow tahu colour dia unique gila and
colour dia is macam matahari macam apa
apa word itu um macam um apa menyinari eh apa
uh ah like macam dia just
and bila kalau um like my brother said ada mango mango tea eh
kalau telan itu fulamak dekat dalam tekak boleh rasa sampai dekat dalam badan it's really really really refreshing guys so kau orang kena try mango kalau kau orang tak pernah try
um recipe eh recipe mungkin um I tak tahu eh
tapi um
siapa siapa tahu buat mango juice senang gila just pecah-pecahkan mango
ah letak ice and letak air sikit dah jadi mango juice
so that's adalah err itu adalah satu ah recipe yang kau orang boleh try
um tak tahu nama dia mango apa lah terserah kan kau orang lah nak namakan apa tapi mango itu macam mango juice sedap gila
apa lagi eh err atau tak nak buat mango cake
tak pernah ada orang buat mango cake
boleh letak mango buah-buah dia semua
um hias cantik-cantik err colour pun kuning sama macam mango
atau chef chef yang dekat luar sana yang tahu buat mango cake ah bentuk dia betul-betul macam mango dia punya texture dia design dia semua ah pun boleh juga
oh kau orang pernah try mango puff

maybe polar ke dekat um
prima deli ke
there's um cakap pasal recipe
uh and berbual pasal cakes and stuff I think um
kau kalau kau orang yang dengar macam lapar juga eh
I tak tahu lah recipe apa yang ada untuk mango tapi um
mango tak ada recipe lah like you can do whatever you want with mango you can smash it you can just eat it
and bukan makanan jer yang dia orang keluarkan dia orang keluarkan syrup juga
betul tak I mean like they uh they they they
untuk like special ah special occasions ke atau like special events ke atau tak
it's just so nice that macam like
err like we love mango everyday we eat mango tapi
so bila
I also macam like
oh dengan mango mango eh oh banyak sekali um
after you keluarkan from the freezer
I just tak tahu ah macam suka sangat lah err mango yang it's very very cold so
bila telan kan when I eat this mango right when it's cold
I just feel so so so refreshed macam tekak ini sejuk gila especially when it's during hot days like sunny days
cooling mango oh my god it's just refreshing so much betul tak
lagi-lagi when
really really really really satisfying you know macam
bila tengah berpeluh eh tengah like
just finished err doing some activities with your families dekat park ke and everything then this
err ice cream seller tiba-tiba datang and then jual you ice cream and then you bought this you buy this uh ice cream punya eh um mango ice cream
then you telan during these summer days
tengok my accent pun dah jadi woo macam sebab dah sedap sangat dalam otak ini walaupun tak makan
I pun tak tahu so because
kalau dekat sekolah ada kerja I'm just going to do it
but when dekat rumah macam tiba-tiba nak
like cause mostly kita kan kita semua ada practical kita semua ada theory
and kalau kat sekolah ada practical I will always do it and kalau dekat rumah ah like he said home based learning
kalau ada theory
I'm just going to revise ah if tak then I'm just going to listen to whatever
cikgu explain ke or
other subjects ke other topics I'm just going to listen
but other than that I think kalau dekat sekolah I'm productive kot because mostly I'm doing
tak pernah malas ah tak tak pernah sekali malas ah
malas pun kalau dah penat kalau dah shag gila
tapi um my last meal
entah I I I I come back
jangan cakap lah eh I think my favourite food for now it's um chicken chop
black pepper dia orang is just
ada rasa lah like confirm ada rasa punya lah macam
tak boleh describe ah sebab sedap sangat you know macam nak makan sekarang juga you know something like that have you ever felt like that way when you talk about your favourite food and then you feel like you're hungry right now
betul-betul gila I mean like
kita macam tak berbual pasal makan pun we're still hungry
apa lagi kalau tengok kalau tengah tengah penat eh habis tengah lapar habis scroll instagram
oh my god macam dah itu tak apa sedap pula itu and
lagipun it's very rare for us to find in singapore so
hais buat lapar jer
I don't know if you guys tahu ke tak syafiq kyle
he's a malaysian um actor and dia pernah main dekat cerita nur
as dalam dekat cerita nur ini
dia main sebagai um
as an ustad
dia baru balik jordan for um untuk apa
err mengetahui lagi uh lebih lanjut dia punya pengetahuan sebagai ustad lah like
he wants to become an ustad you know because his family is really really pious well he came from a pious family
with a what do you call pelacur
dia nak cari err apa
dia nak cari err
so I think this cerita boleh you know
dari cerita nur because cerita nur is mostly all about err religious yang
siapa-siapa yang suka tengok cerita yang you know ada ustad habis ada you know macam
yang suka dengar ah ayat-ayat suci al-quran
you can just uh pergi tengok cerita nur because
apa lagi bila syafiq kyle tengah
fuh syafiq kyle tengah baca al-quran
merdu gila like
banyak lagi ah my ah I have a polaroid of him
I hope kau orang yang tahu situation COVID nineteen ini
tolong lah pakai mask eh tak mahu tak mahu tak pakai mask
because wati sounds like you know bibik bibik punya nama
macam makcik-makcik punya nama you know like bibik wati no please no I mean only only my families can but not my friends okay not
sampai december and I'll be graduating already and I think I'm planning to take um maybe
err talking about language err languages ah I can speak macam biasa melayu
then nanti you nak tengok cerita apa
Greenland apa lagi
to be honest kan I don't know how they record
like macam mana macam mana dia orang record
so then tiba tiba kerja continue continue continue then err
but what if they start recording okay tak apa ah then that means the movie wouldn't be out what
I mean pernah lah macam let's say like you know you're scrolling through the channel kan
then macam oh disney channel then got mulan then tengok ah then like oh whatever
ya then the I think like was it because of the dad macam rasa
disappointed pasal anak dia perempuan so tak ada orang yang boleh carry on
okay what do you mean by terpaksa because if she's terpaksa kan okay at first she's a guy eh she's a woman
tak tak pernah tengok that's like okay I watched the movie but I don't know what the hell the movie is about
she she sakit then she baring I think sick or whatever I don't know
orang tengah berbual pasal mulan
oh so even okay the dad tak boleh pasal dia sakit
tapi in the in that government even though kau sakit ke apa eh sorry
even though if you sakit
okay even if you sakit or not tak kisah you have to go is that the rule
so the the mulan dia macam kasihan kan that's why she left that note
oh what to curi
no tak the first wish yang dia buat is dia nak jadi prince
I think bukan renovation it's just macam err
ya there's no one tapi that time eh that time I went is before corona is it
cause they I think pasal dia orang dah tukar eh
yang wave wave pool the big one
dia macam very mundane the wave not really like power
no longkang longkang yang jalan sendiri lazy pool
ah longkang longkang
and the actual olympic punya swimming
you you try move your apa ni paket you taruh depan you
pasal kalau you tengok you punya sound wave kan dia macam when you kill let's say
grey tuan
oh cause my one dia gerak banyak seh maybe because my voice is loud ah
okay okay you see ah my my wave besar tahu
I I jauh begini pun boleh dengar
there was this one girl yang
I was with macam sama sekolah
so kita just grow like from nursery K one eh
nursery K one K two whatever whatever whatever kan sampai P six
then my adik dengan dia punya adik pun sama kelas
so then dia orang macam kacau kacau my adik kan adik dia lah
kalau they if you find one
guy and one girl in the same class for very long time then they will just start to assume yang kau orang ada benda
ya so begitu jer lah tapi
it was just like macam
a topic in macam mak bapa berbual
bila primary six
kan then I tak tahu kenapa ah
then macam rasa macam suka suka macam nak jumpa
ya allah eh wait eh belum habis eh jap
ya so macam uh apa ni
suka nak jumpa that kind of thing
macam cute kan P six
eh eh eh eh dia ni
ni what do you mean by you like the person you like err you eh
I thought eh sia ah dini gerek sia kalau dengan dia pun best
but I think I think my one is amplified eh like berbual
tak pasal I berbual biasa tahu this is considered normal to me tahu but then it's like
you know there's in a group there's that one that takes charge macam let's say kalau you nak keluar
there's that one guy okay lah kita gini ah then everyone macam okay ah go ah no problem macam yes
actually when the robot tu dengar gemuk
then the robot dengan dengar apa benda dia ni bual pasal gemuk
so ya there's leader ni
actually just just two people tahu
so macam let's say okay
so everywhere they go kan ah okay lah jom ah like then okay lah pergi makan ah okay lah jom ah jom ah main bola ah
okay okay lah go ah that kind of ya so macam primary school what I did was
P one P two begitu

then I masuk class kan semua tanya ah I remember seh
tengok eh what did you do
ya that's why macam tak kena
eh dah lama tak jumpa
yeah I'm just my friend is just to find a jobs lah flexible part time jobs you know to suit my schedule especially like my intern is not paid right  abih kena cari kerja sendiri lah
 asal boring what you doing at home
yes it almost three years already and we are gonna graduate next year  tak sabar rasanya
stress kan  kena buat ni semua but I'm glad  macam its all over already lah now dah holiday  boleh enjoy
 apa was the assignment about duh
 apa itu I tak faham
err so far only  satu je lah like one module err we learn about airport management it's quite interesting lah cause you get to learn about the operations behind a airports right like how the run or what what other things involved yeah
oh my dream job is to be stewardess lah like cause  macam you know that time the first time I took a flight to penang then the stewardess served me right then from there I was like inspired I want to be like them
so from there  macam I work hard lah to you know I do research about aviation about stewardess all these
yeah that was one of my dreams  tapi macam susah lah  nak jadi pilot you need a lot of qualification yeah so now I just want to be a stewardess first lah I see lah if
I want to work at singapore airlines lah but  banyak orang cakap susah nak masuk ah because high standard  semua so now I looking for maybe other travel budget airlines like the Scoot or Jetstar asia
oh sekarang ni I I tengah tengok drama korea ah korea ah cerita lama lah cerita legend of the blue sea
just now I eat ah  nasi with  kari daging
wah  sedap nya
 boleh jugak your mom  masak semua
 macam hari raya pulak
yeah but then like my other friends they  banyak kena campak dekat err company  yang tak related to aviation  macam logistics then like some of them will be like under administration or marketing that kind of job
 belum susah cause  aku tengah cari flexible or adhoc kind of job kan  tapi mostly like they want you know minimum commitment three to four days a week that kind and like you know office hours yeah so hard lah I need to find a flexible one because I scared if they ask me to come to the changi airport then if I working the part time job then I cannot go there how you know so I need to prioritize my intern first
yeah because because like I said lah like the participation never all actually I do participate but I just don't unmute my mic because I don't dare and like ya lah a bit  takut ah when if you talk then you will talk alone
good lah was it a  macam manageable or stressful
 abih kau macam mana macam ada plans  nak buat business eh
tak they see eh I see like they sell those gadgets you know like speakers lah
just like the other cafes  semua those that sell the mains all yeah
 sikit sikit lama lama jadi bukit
yeah this one also actually I I don't want it to be at somewhere ulu somewhere err a place people cannot find
you know like some cafes like in the ulu places right then people want to
and cannot be ulu lah like I said
 sekarang
you mean like malay food  ke
 tauhu bergedil lah I I love that  tauhu bergedil then what else ah bubble tea the what ah oh that time I saw err dalgona bubble tea or something
yeah mostly all at bugis east area like you said lah in the west also not much  halal options cause very boring lah east is the best lah because they have a lot of good food there
a'ah  kalau kereta senang boleh pergi mana mana jer  jauh jauh pon takpe because very convenient
 selalu pergi lah  kadang kadang malam malam ikut err  abah aku pergi isi minyak isi minyak kereta err  pastu kita orang gi makan burger or we go McDonald's right then eat their burger is so nice duh I like their McDonald's menu
yeah but Ramly  dari sana but then I don't like because err  banyak sayur
oh I I've eaten before um  apa tu
it it is okay leh not is like it is a bit like err  ayam and  daging ah
I mean  daging beef a bit a bit like that it just a bit  keras
there's also err burger  arnab
I don't know why I was daring to try that deer meat lah you know cause like I'm there already so  mak I say just try something new because I like to explore what I like to try new food
then that stall also they got sell the  ais kacang
 senang ah  nak cari makanan halal untuk kita
ah I miss also I want to go the  tapak food truck
yeah like the food range for maybe seven  ringgit onwards
that time I bought the buttermilk chicken rice it's ten  ringgit
talking about  nasi lemak I remember that time I went
 abih err  kita orang makan  nasi lemak  dengan lauk lauk lauk pauk you know  nasi lemak then I I  taruk err  ayam of course  ayam ah  ayam goreng
then  taruk like some other  lauk ah like the  sambal telur you know  sambal kerang wah it's really nice
 halal food options so it's so easy for us to find  halal food so like at our hotel right err just across the street there's already like two to three  halal restaurants then as you go down the street there is more option for you lah
 tak I  pergi jogjakarta
 mertabak manis
 sedap gila seh I  suka gila
I've been getting a lot of comments  macam bapak aku dengan pak cik aku cakap eh dah dah dah  apa eh

then ah tak apa ah malas sangat bawa
then in the end we go there then because we got no bento no jala no what so in the end we use rod stand
rod stand the metal rod stand then we we just asar the tip make sure it's slightly sharper lah we go inside the water
we see we see we see one crab we whack so all the crabs right the twenty plus ah all got one lubang
all at least got one lubang one
think ketam bunga ah
wan one wan one dah tidur juga ah no you wan five I think then wan one wan okay wan one
he thirty plus wan tu baru kahwin wan three drive lorry eh err van van sorry wan four I never seen before
ah this wan one sleep han dah sleep then hakim tengah masak
err the behind the crab island lah ah pulau ubin he was there at pulau ubin then after that so I I told err hakim eh err nak nak tukar tu ah umpan because he's
then I ask him eh you don't want to open your rod campak umpan then he was like nanti ah tengok then I was like okay lah tak apa ah I go I go change my umpan
the the rest of them was doing their umpan on the left side so I went to their right side
then ambil ah udang hidup pegang lah benda tu goyang-goyang then tengah tengah dah dah dah
dah poke ah dah poke the udang
then dah campak dah campak dah rilek ah then I was like ya tengok it was it's a nice scenery lah then then I realised I I heard something on the right side then I was like itu apa tu then I I listen closely lah
then it was actually azan ah ah three
three azan I don't know azan buat lah terkejut I also don't know lah
ya three ah azan then I was like azan eh then because I look to the I look inside I look inside the forest then it was pitch dark
then I was like the only the only way this can be like real ah if there is a kampung beside lah
so I keep the story to myself first then the next day I ask nos eh nos beside yang tempat we pancing got kampung ah then tak ada lah then I was like
oh tak ada ah pukul tiga pagi lepas aku tukar umpan
I heard ada macam ada orang tengah azan and I I stood there for quite some time lah just to make sure I'm hearing it correctly lah eh kau tak bilang ah
oh kau tak kejut aku then I was like apa nak kau jangka buat apa dah kat situ
so he was like um tertidur
then he tried to sleep you know ah he always try to sleep when he pancing one then he try to sleep then he cannot sleep know then dia pusing pusing pusing then he he looked to the right
then you know that that place have you went to that place before there's like this big tree lah kat tengah-tengah in the middle of the open area then he wake up then he looked to his side
he was quite close to the tree lah then he saw one nenek one nenek
walk pass then he was like ah the nenek told him like cu cu dah tahu sini tempat keras kan asal malap jer di tempat you eh macam tempat you pula eh no no no not that
why why um malap jer tempat cucu ni tak bagus tahu malap-malap like he was just saying like is not good that the place that they was fishing is dim like because my friend usually he bring one big torchlight lah but that day he just never on it lah then
apa tu err macam this one is mystics lah like mystic mystic stuff so he was like
keep quiet then rilek-rilek then the nenek um turned and walked away walked into the forest or something like that lah
then the driver say got one time he was passing by ah at night ah then he actually saw at the pokok there ada err pocong ah tengah
so it it means that like that nenek come to actually warn them that that place very malap then got other stuff also lah then that that nenek just go there to warn them lah like be careful you see
ya is ya so but that place that place quite is is quite nice lah but it's just malam ya malam kena jaga-jaga ya
no no there was no building around us so is is like okay this one is where the driver will drive eh drive then this is an open area di sini ada satu pokok in the middle
path ah actually the right path also can you will see pulut ketam in front of you that stretch like that ah towards the tip lah you can see the whole tip of pulau ketam
then your past few days macam mana your past few months ah ah the time the last
time I met you then you say you just berhenti kerja pe you just stop work
so apa you you apply mostly what type of apa industry
what phone call eh kau cakap bahasa melayu sikit kau english all the way eh have you never notice beginning
so you apply for your job back to back to the story ya back to the cerita so kau dah apply kerja habis semua tak dapat ah all all rejected you
sakit hati ah
surrounding have a few other masjid in the east
no lah I think this kind of things right is where you as a person who have experience have background juga kan
you will need to come in and explain to them oh tak lah this the way the reason why I letak the moderator first then followed by the asatizah then followed by err fandi ahmad is because
um according to my knowledge in the industry like I took diploma and whatsoever uh I know that first kau kena letak the moderator first
why why why the moderator first pasal dia yang akan moderate everything then followed by the asatizah who are
no lah to me I guess is in it really boils down to people's knowledge and also how flexible they are in this type of macam situasi lah
ya that's why lah that's not like you said lah is tak professional lah
of course is the comic lah because it shows that things are being brought down to your level itself it's not that you your age group akan dibawa naikkan to the adult level so you know that
when you go you will experience things that dalam kamu punya age group lah so it's better for you in that sense ah
ya and also actually I I actually salute people who do freelance photography and everything because the camera dah berapa mahal then err the time you took to edit I actually
pernah I pernah help you out with the edits even though I got no knowledge ah tentang video ah the video that
the video that I recorded the video that I recorded was for one of my internship lah then after that then apa tu the thing is
kenapa tak ada any background in Photoshop ke apa ke so nak edit tak tahu macam mana nak edit so I ask you for help that time
and the thing is it wasn't like per say it was tak susah because tak banyak animation tak banyak at that time lah it's just
trying to put two videos together to match the sequence itu pun dah boleh jadi gila
then ya I understand because as a programmer nanti I do some programs ke apa and I mean some more I'm getting paid know because I'm an intern
later dah dah buat setengah jalan nanti eh hakim um actually the client tak suka uh this part of the game ah can change it then dalam hati aku macam what it took me hours to get that part working
so I need to change and then I need to figure out I need go and research tengok whether apa tu apa yang client tu nak is feasible tak can it be included
into the program itself macam the way the mechanics works and everything then I need time so oh sakit
true story actually sebelum ni banyak cerita dah cakap
no lah is is just pelik lah
dah start merepek
you know the back to the story sikit right just now I talk about my intern so my intern kan I was being paid err one thousand dollars
eh rilek ah rilek ah dengar dulu but but the thing is the time err I'm from
so bila kita um want to sign up for apa tu for internship you need to go through this website ah I forgot what's the website oh my apa website dia ah
ada lah website tu ada ada lah masih situ ah
so I went I went there then I went to search the thing is right I filter my search according to gaji so the highest paying one I highlight it first I I
I filtered it according to whether I I want to do the job then after I filter then there was like I think fifteen over ah fifteen over jobs okay then I filtered through gaji like which one is higher pay lah
then I went in then I went in rilek-rilek talk with my colleagues then got other interns juga situ they are leaving already
then I was like eh your gaji berapa ah how much kau dapat every month one thousand huh eh one thousand sikitnya
wah sikitnya one thousand then they look at me like how much you are getting paid then I like oh according to the website they say I'm getting paid like I don't know lah but
then comes my paycheck I went to see one thousand then I like apa hal ni
malas you know typical malay right
like you know typical malay ah once you know you need to go the extra mile it's okay lah rezeki di mana-mana
no you will say can boleh macam mana oh you need to sign up this you need to do that ah tak apa
Grab lah last time you were talking about Grab because ya no because I was like trying to go see macam dia punya timeline ah like what do you
kau cakap kau nak kerja Grab I mean as a
Deliveroo oh betul eh jauh
if you if you hustle even more macam hustle demi hustle jer is like that then usually you can get like four four orders
if you really can't get anything because apa tu okay lah I got learn some finance also lah kan you should know lah so is is quite is quite a need to actually like have some kind of
ways for you to get money in lah rather than just duit terkeluar duit terkeluar then also I know that you have been out of job for quite some time
then it's not that you don't want to find job it's just the rezeki belum masuk lagi in terms of your full time whatsoever so I
if I'm if I'm you then start off with delivering dulu lah then while delivering then you can because when you do part time

uh I'm like it require three months aku tiga bulan dah start sekolah ape kalau gitu
eh I play with me I will download it and then boleh main sama-sama
I don't I I err boleh boleh tanya orang lain
oh err ada lah or
ya because they tengok a lot of TikTok and then like there's this gamer she played with a group of friends so funny I like I want to try nak cuba
oh my god it's like okay so I watched his TikTok of the like they play Among Us right he's so funny this intruder you know what's David he he swipe the knife right then after that got someone coming into the area that he killed a person then you know what he did he just press press press dia punya butang after that he hide the body behind him
mm betul wah I miss playing night games with people
yeah that's why they say what ruins friendships small UNO atau Among Us then I'm like
err all meat but I can still eat daging lembu yes
yeah because daging lembu selalu macam they have this smell
yeah yeah and then tak boleh tahan it's really bad for me especially like when my parents cook right then I always make a big fuss right I hate the smell
I mean tak boleh predict pe so
yeah especially since err nanti the fish will macam bau ja hanyir so people don't like fish when they're pregnant usually also yeah
nak but then
bila nak pergi what's the plan
twenty eight agak near lah kena check again
okay yeah my poly friends also dia orang selalu nak jumpa habis tu macam tak ada benda lain nak buat ke they all already start uni
tak sekolah lain-lain seh
entah lah dia orang nak jumpa makan lah nak jumpa belajar then I'm like kau semua belajar benda lain-lain abeh nak belajar sama-sama
yeah then macam guys move on
that's why then I macam aiya whatever lah it's up to them then next week ah minggu depan ada orang nak jumpa then they were like oh kita tunggu untuk Carea to like give when she free to meet then I'm like
yeah then eh I just open the chat habis tu I kan I just say mm err you guys go ahead I'm not free
then the makanan they all want to eat also selalu dia orang nak minta makanan I tak boleh makan
yeah cause dengan our secondary school friends kita tak ada macam masalah macam gitu pe selalu it's very easy for us to settle food what
yeah then is don't know lah is that time like I think after school we all wanted to hang out then they were like oh let's eat Umisushi then okay aku tak boleh makan
yeah it's like oh let's go out and eat together but then in the end you never show something that we can eat together right habis tu buat apa nak kata kita makan sama-sama
yeah I understand it's it's like when you meet dengan dia orang it's supposed to be enjoyable but when you meet them then at the end of the thing you're just like penat seh why did I go out I regret going out of the house
boleh experiment then you see mana satu lagi murah
uh yeah aigoo dah lah tak ada kerja habis tu bus fare pun mahal hais
oh I was so confused by it I I didn't do the survey dia punya yeah
yeah I mean it's very different perspective of problems lah like for us our problem is that we cannot get on the bus but for other people it's a different kind of problem like before we had the wheelchair accessible punya bus how do wheelchair people like get on the bus
cause even for like macam orang yang tak boleh nampak like visual disability they have new apps macam the what's that they say like you can take a photo or something with the handicapped phone then they help you read out the text or something like that
cause even for my school cause Ngee An kan ada that dialogue in the dark so we have the what's the term called the sight disability pun I there was this period of time I had like macam class right then every time if I reach school dekat this certain timing I will see that makcik that cannot see then I will help her but she will need help to cross the bridge
oh forest no tak dengar eh
wah was the forest fire macam bad
oh my gosh why apa gunanya gender reveal seriously
it's macam
pakai banyak sangat duit habis tu tak it doesn't add any meaning to anyone's life honestly it's just
I guess maybe we have different values like untuk kita if you have a child is more of like between yeah it's a blessing it's between your family you and your husband
wah ah speaking of Kelly and her mum the cake that she mm baked untuk your birthday wah I still think of it sometimes
yeah cause I mean I think the cake macam dry because dah simpan satu hari pe dah potong then you give it to them the next day but wah the whipped cream I was so amazed cause selalu whipped cream kan diorang buat cake is either macam banyak sangat then too sweet or like the whipping cream macam how to say ya macam berminyak is that the word like
yeah don't cause you messaged me habis tu you messaged dengan orang lain kan and we were like err dia tak kan beli cake kan like err err err
that's why when you asked me kalau nak cake then I like I like cake but kalau aku bilang aku nak cake nanti kau beli macam mana
no she panic cause yang when you were working together yang ada satu hari ni then after that kita send message then you pakai dia punya handphone kan then dia eh guys Nisha pakai aku punya handphone then we were like oh did she see the chat
yeah then we ni we panic right then kita tukar dia punya group name it was supposed to be like what about thirty first then we changed to orientation twenty twenty
yeah eh I can pinjam you my account to watch
cause yeah cause this one kena bayar
it's it's super hilarious macam you you boleh nampak their innocence as normal people and not like it's so funny
err sekarang dah ada empat if you want to include macam behind the scenes ada lapan in total
no no I was talking about the merchandise yeah right the cawan was okay this time round the merchandise quite cute yeah they got cawan I was like
is is like your cup nya design is like rounded at the bottom and then the colour is green
right it's ugh and it's not very like macam merchandise is you
wah you know the only time yang diorang letak diorang punya muka right the I think is the merchandise I was like nampak macam dua ribu tiga belas
mm I see so many Youtube videos of people like they are not fans but their room is covered in punya bantal</malay lah dia punya soft toy then I like
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the the chibi the tiny Tan oh my god oh I wanted to get their things and then after that aku nampak dia punya harga dengan dia punya shipping fee then I'm like
dia punya shipping macam boleh beli tiga dia punya product tau I was like ugh
yeah that's why when I renew my membership right the membership kit is like twenty then after that I checked out right dia punya shipping the whole price went up to seventy then I like
oh no no no that one change already cause that one is diorang punya old style
you want to level up untuk dapat lebih banyak benda you must do the quiz and fill up the test
tak dia this one is more like accessible I guess but it's also scary cause people who are not their fans can easily buy and get in
tapi bodoh lah just tak you spend like ape thirty dollars just to kacau orang on the website
well nak beli this macam sweater it's a knitted sweater lah then I also looking at this skirt
yeah err I think the skirt dalam dua belas dollar gitu
tak it's just I want to save up the money first
because the shipping is only macam dalam dua tiga dollar gitu aje not much
yeah cause macam it's not really like ethical I don't think is ethical like sourcing it's probably like those cheap cheap warehouse punya factory lah so yeah
dah boleh off
like in that one stream because kirakan everyone dapat lepas geram ah that kind of thing so finally can get to give him money and people will send him like five hundred dollars at the time I was like damn these people got money I also want sia I haven't sent my first super chat but I want to send to someone I'm planning to do it when someone is doing then I can be like thank you for your service thank you very much
this girl also she she debuted like I think a month back her avatar is very cute she's like a shark girl she's super cute with the tail and all that she debuted like less than two months ago then she already hit like a million subscribers everyone was just throwing money at her it's insane dude and these people never even don't even need to show their face they just sit there act cute on camera play game tu jer easy game dapat duit
so everybody was like okay just wait until the next character banner comes up which I think will be zhong li that's why tu aku pun nak sia he's so hot I cannot I really cannot
uh oh then yesterday I was watching another one of his streams it was it was the funniest like games stream that I've ever watched because so there's this girl her name is chihiro yuki but basically she's her main character is like uh this magic girl and then but sometimes she she uses like a deeper voice kirakan macam jadi lelaki lah that kind of thing so uh then she was streaming Apex with that voice and then suddenly these two guys two of her friends join in then they like want to play along then dorang pun buat suara merepek gitu then they were like oh I want to do this then they were like shit they were saying it in the in the like manly voice and then suddenly they go back oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that it's damn funny but if they stream didn't last for that long long lah but
tapi I faham that situation that was me when I was playing when I started playing zelda I was like so kecoh you know I'm like aku macam budak bodoh sia aku aku nak nak simpan dia nya apa tu I wanted to like stop I would accidentally press the arrow button like to to aim the bow and arrow then after that bila aku nak aku nak cancel kan aku lupa nak cancel then instead I press the left side dia nya down button and then that's how you activate the whistle right then after that instead I start attracting all the monsters in the middle of the night macam budak bodoh sia I died so many times while playing that
lagipun you main you like now you play is it PUBG or is it COD
the theory of relativity for fun like this guy then I remembered the one thing I used to play a lot I had the Wii Fit then aku just duduk itu dengan apa tu dia nya itu like the the white punya platform itu then I look at the thing then I'm like eh aku berat ah sia then after that I was like okay whatever moving on but that was quite fun then but I did have the
uh I don't know ah I don't remember her name but I went to her house cause my mak nak pergi masjid so she had to drop me off there ah then she was then oh my cousin like she was playing Mortal Kombat on the then you know at the ripe at the really young age of four then like she was playing it and I saw it and I saw someone's spine get ripped out of their body and then um ya it kinda traumatised me I couldn't sleep that night cause I was always looking at the door I was scared that someone would come in and then rip my spine out ya so that's
oh serious ah dia orang belum like you beli kat mana Shopee
I think you try dahulu kalau dia orang tak reply baru send email
serious masih belum
it's kat Carousell or what
BTOB huh BTOB can they okay to be fair I guess half of the band half of the band is still in the army but the first thing I think I showed you right the first thing like changsub and eunkwang just got like uh they just got released right recently then the first thing they do is go act stupid or some national television show where some matching gold and silver outfit with the X on bodoh it's like if I don't know if you know but they did something similar like a long time ago
it's it's like those body tight suits then changsub pakai yang gold then eunkwang pakai yang silver or some or it was the other way around it was like skin tight you know it's the kind cuma muka dia orang jer boleh nampak and then they go on national television you know and then they go sing some stupid trot song then they come out of the army okay lah admittedly now is a bit more classy dia orang pakai macam like black they like the black business pants black business shirt that kind but doesn't take away from the fact that they are doing something so bodoh but okay lah I miss them I'm glad they're back those two are probably my favourite members
so now I'm but I'm so I'm glad that in wait in the army got to rest I'm glad that he he and key got to enlist together that one was damn funny the video with the band members dia orang tengah buat hal kat belakang tu kan tu merepek sia but at least at least it's good to see that they're having fun in this
tapi dia orang punya army macam best jer
like the concert I remember eunkwang was inside one like dia orang masuk army buat ke pe ke dia orang tengah buat some musical school or what sia I don't get it dia orang ada military band lah buat performance sini performance sana dia orang buat parade abeh tu kita kat singapura dia orang macam nak mati sia
I feel like april some should have gotten though I was talking to my secondary school friend the other day then then his was he had to enlist in april tapi dia dah dapat
I'm aku aku pun tak tahu sia I have one friend who cause dorang ada I cannot I don't
he got an offer to join like dia orangnya commando training or something like that it's like macam
I feel like elite is too is too strong of a word but macam lebih dia orangnya fitness level is a bit higher than the rest
seram sia then he then they said that oh they will learn
kirakan body of the army isn't it or is that weapons infantry
tak kan
ah I remember I remember the whole fiasco everybody was like oh my god what happens if they need to enlist like guys chill it's their it's the law they need this is bigger than you guys weh tapi seram seh the fact that they have to draw lots I feel like that's scarier I rather just everyone enlist like that
there has to be a better way to do it rather than drawing lots it really felt like oh dia orang dah tak boleh kesah korang nak macam mana nak buat macam ini ah tak pe lah aku tak kesah ah pick lots jer lah gitu jer
gitu jer really that's the gitu jer the effort
but it's seram sia
ah itu itu itu itu itu that was probably the most war like thing I've watched but
and it's budak kecil lagi
the part when dia apa itu dia kasi batu eh batu then dia ingat it's gula or something like that
my nenek was I remember she I cannot remember if she told me the story or my mum told me the story
dia orang tengah I think they were like searching the houses or something like that then
dia nya mak bapa they put her and her siblings
rice sack then letak kat dalam drain then two of them the siblings they put they hide the siblings inside the rice sack cause dia orang masih kecil kan then dia orang letak kat dalam drain dia orang cover then after that they ran away I don't know what happened after that I didn't really ask I kinda wanna know but I don't really want to ask cause
lagipun masih kecil sia it's
dia orang naik sampan serious
you'd be budak indonesia now wow
it's the one that resulted in yang dia orangnya nuclear meltdown kan is it
cacat isn't the right word because it looks very pretty but it seems like it's all deformed and like
correct correct it's like what you see in like sci-fi movies gitu seram siot I wonder if they rebuilt it
merepek sia this guy
but I do but I guess that's the one thing about japan ah dia orang they're very secular
new zealand aku pakai hijab kan then bila kita masuk okay lah granted this was quite a long time ago
kita me and my mum my dad cause me and my mum dua-dua pakai tudung kan kita masuk cafe dia orang tengok kita macam kat zoo sia dia orang macam
like bro chill I'm ten like don't okay I wasn't ten but like like like don't need to stare so hard you know but then when bila kita kita pergi japan all that they were much more polite about it even if they didn't like it they didn't say it outright
belongings anymore you can't retrieve like old photo books so it's kind of like everything your whole life just got washed away like that ya and at that time I think a lot people at the beach also so ya lah it was quite suay that it happened and I don't think it just affected aceh it affected some parts of malaysia also ya ya then kat situ pun ada macam satu family dia orang pun dia orang tengah main-main kat beach then dia nya anak pergi lari near the coastline ya then
seram pe
that's true ya the pros are pretty big considering that we have like protection from natural disasters singapore like singapore is a pretty safe country I would say like the fact that I can leave the house with the windows open and come back with everything still intact I think that's pretty impressive within itself like I saw the news dia orang kan like ada orang malaysia tinggal kat singapura since the borders dah tutup kan
limited is it like orang like pekerja so like I think either they went back or the police found out or the neighbours ke pe he found and he had the house they had the house had been broken into then apparently the thieves the
right it's so gross kan like can you imagine you come you cannot go back to your own country because of COVID and after that when you go back all your stuff dah hilang then ada orang tidur kat dalam katil kau ee seram sia I cannot it's gross it's so gross
for all the homeless people in like los angeles or that part of los angeles cause itself is besar gila kan there's only two doctors who are offering who will go around giving out free healthcare free check ups for these people like can you imagine the first the the fact that firstly there's so many homeless people is already like so telling of korangya government but then the fact that so many doctors like come on obviously there has to be a lot of doctors right in america the fact that only that cuma orang dua orang jer are willing to give out free treatment for these homeless people like they seriously what do you lose from it you know like where's your basic sense of humanity if you've got you've got the knowledge and skills korang just check up sikit pun boleh pe the fact that only two people regularly do it
it's so insane I cannot stand america dia orang nak vote pun buat hal
it's gross sia then now also I just really hope really really really I pray to god ya allah please forgive me for all my sins just just make sure donald trump tak menang serious I if people if
people are still dia orang nak tulis apa tu cause you can write in to you can even if your candidate name is not there right you can write in the name of someone which is a bit bodoh ah honestly like what's the point a lot of people dia orang tulis nama kanye west tau because he was he's been joking about it no it to us he feels like he's joking but to him it's like he's it's real right he's been talking about oh vote me in for president president guys then I'm like
asal kau nak buat macam ini ya allah serious why it's so bodoh I cannot and the fact that
it's like I was a bit scared because jangan vote opposition for the sake of voting opposition like you kena tengok pandai-pandai lah look at the zone if it's versus what
reform party or something the the group that nampak macam gangster mat mat on the street macam mat biker ke pe macam at like
if they can't even give a proper speech if they can't even sound motivated on national television you think they can take care of your zone and all like pandai-pandai ah don't vote anyhow for the reform party lah
like I get that it's good to have opposition but pandai-pandai ah don't
I have to admit though cause dahulu I tinggal kat serangoon kan I used to stay under worker's party area yang hougang serangoon aljunied itu I have to admit a lot of things were broken a lot of things weren't fixed properly that kind of thing but I guess you're right lah ya dia orangnya financial backing
but that's the part that I don't get kalau they're dia orang dah kat dalam government
abeh itu then they want to upgrade the resident's like area
ugh so sad I really cannot I'm I'm never gonna get over it aku serious nak pergi overseas
that's why sia the moment we were like waiting for the news is the border going to be closed or not but then bila kata tutup then we were like ah shit
it's only end of week one there's so much stuff to do already and I don't know what's going on I feel aku masih belum tengok election video takpe takpe whatever selama aku dapat mark attendance it's okay takde exam pun tak yah kesah
but did you know now that I think about it right at first I was like very sure that I wanted to do magazine but then now that we're actually during production production macam
hmm like not bad seems quite fun also but I guess we have to wait until we actually see what it's like bila the test ah I'm just scared
like that thing anak luar nikah jer
no like okay maybe they got married at eighteen pasal ada anak
wow there's a lot of way way sia macam
okay dalam segi agama I would say okay like really just wise like follow your religious maybe it's a good thing lah like just to settle down like err apa to prevent like any sins or any like um what does it call
no no mm haram and thing and like macam um uh what is it macam the bad like people won't talk bad about you what does that thing call
so macam apa ya
honestly no ah because like nanti macam ingat kau macam main main
like you think what this one main main is it like you what your girlfriend you break up patch back patch back merepek what
ya so like I think okay maybe eighteen is a legal age but no I think that's like marriage like maybe that's too young but unless like how to say like ah I've heard lah stories macam aku nampak yang they got married at seventeen or sixteen ya islam
that's the thing I don't know is it in singapore or malaysia ah malaysia ku entah leh maybe it's normal maybe is not lah but like they say like you know then I see and the thing is the best part is that both parents like err what is restu
ah ah they give restu ah they give I the blessing ah dorang kasih blessing dorang
then it's like wow like that's I think that's takes a lot of courage ah for parents nak kasih restu like to cover him at the young age but then we don't know what the reason the actual reason behind lah kan
now the only thing I can think of when you say young marriage is like maybe they did something or maybe they just like tak sabar
they just want to like so macam like oh
if I get married oh you know everything will be like halal you know macam ni ni ni ni like actually ah he's the one or like you know what I don't know how to explain but like macam
so if later macam if it's just reflects to the people and there's like oh kau tengah stereotype just because I'm young
for me ah okay ah kalau kau tanya aku persendirian aku tak tahu ah because like I think I I really believe yang macam apa ya love does not apa ya time does not define love ke love does not define time ada kat that thing ah
like kalau kau jatuh cinta kalau kau like you and then you feel like he's the one he's the one ah because like I heard stories like my apa apanya cikgu
she was in a relationship ever since like in secondary school sampai ke tua like twenty six like that she was schooling my school like she was ready she was asking to marriage but then guy still wanted to play around
like macam he he wasn't serious he still don't want to get married
no no not not the other chicks lah like macam he's just not ready for marriage dia tak dia tak belum fikir kan lah okay for my cikgu kan she's like okay let's say lepak ah ya
okay the guy likes to lepak jam beberapa jam ke dua tiga pagi tau just lepak bawa blok berbual-bual rokok tu semua right my teacher is like by eleven is like eh aku tak penat jah like I want to go home I want to sleep like so like that ya so macam they they I think it's like eight years' relationship
ya ya they call it off they dia orang tak tunang pun ya they broke up she broke up with him and then after that err kak got to know
find new people think she dated one I think like less than a year and I saw she tunang and then after that a year after that she got married ya ya
ya that's the thing like actually I was shocked that she she like she was okay lah maybe dia ada rasa sedih lah I mean siapa tak rasa sedih kan kalau break up
but she's like you know what this is not what I want like like she knows what she wants tu aku yang jawab aku respect kau ah
you really follow me ah eh kalau ikutkan hati aku
I mean like I've been single for the longest time for so macam like
you know you just gonna get any guy then kalau like kau okay aku okay kita go ah sia
but then it's like okay let's say kau
kau dengan my dear kau berapa lama
boleh but then you think your parents will agree
oh tak boleh sambung uh huh
ya I think I've heard stories like they they they just like marry by paper but they still macam go on lah macam I think they are like schooling or something macam let's say kes kalau ni ah
from there ah then masuk like okay lah slowly perlahan perlahan kayuh ah
society nya sekarang now is like I think apa ever since okay let's say our generation ah eh like okay let's say my after our parents' generation like maybe the like early nineties or like the late eighties all of them run dusted the career minded path semua yang tak nak kahwin pun
mm like angkat kaki hurry I already late for work
and then lepas tu macam like complain bila jam
eh amboi
oh I thought like actually yang aku akan like will go itu I thought like people would really go to because like we like
okay aku dengar macam actually dorang nya price for okay pharmaceutical wise lah ya pharmaceutical wise dorang cakap mahal it's very mahal some
some medications dorang cakap is mahal gila some I think it's like affordable
apa tu suburbs

ya something like the guy I don't know why the guy would like got hype like to me he's okay jer lah like okay lah handsome handsome tapi macam
kenapa kurang jahat sangat sia just because like okay his asian looking and he has a like apa american-ish accent he has an accent like so actually he's from malaysia like
tak handsome tak hebat
they say have is it at sequel or I mean like a trilogy ke apa ah aku tak tahu ah tapi ada lah itu it's like

lepas tu like because of that apparently china ban the movie that's what I heard from my friend that's what I heard from my friend they say like err ban in china that's why like it's very accessible on the website lah so I watch it on website lah
and the quality is not that bad honestly it's not that bad tengoklah then like okay I know mulan is not going to be the the the macam typical Disney tau like there won't be any musical
the bila aku dengar that part right I like eh aku dah boring lor because I I really love mulan the the cartoon one eh aku suka sangat lagu reflection
ya lepas tu apabila dari life general tua sahaja donnie yen ketua ip man
lepas tu aku disappointed sia
so we like her to fall in love with the general like shang but she fall in love macam another fellow err apa soldier
that's the thing okay so according to my mum mak ku cakap like pe you need pe you know something different daripada like typical Disney ya exactly if Disney like
I expected like some entahlah I was disappointed lah with but jalan cerita was okay like is like normal lah and then lepas tu okay what my friend say that before like err I watch the movie my friend said the the the mulan lead actress

okay let's go back to first thing that we kita berbual tadi we are always rushing for time kau nak aku kerja dua job family mana
ah kau nak complain pasal ah apa apa apa err birth rate uh decreasing of birth rate because kau nak suruh aku kerja dua kerja eh
eh dia ingat dia senang ah dia minister ah
oh my gosh woo lawak wah kejap kejap kejap
part time boleh seven dollars sikit saja
up just up the pay by what nine dollars I think I think nine dollars honestly like this time okay lah fine this time because of COVID mungkin susahlah let's say non COVID period just up the the part time to like nine dollars at least ah at least
ya exactly the only thing that were that one is just time ah minyak okay lah let's say we don't we don't use the the the car or the bike ah we use scooter
tak ke minister gila nak sama kita kerja dua job
my places places apa
okay tempat kerja aku
uh apa they they have this form to let uh what does it call ah macam and need to sign ah let's say like oh to confirm that I'm not working another job you know that thing ah ah ah that one
the second job ya I mean obviously saya nak saya boleh ah tapi like macam still haiya entahlah I really think it's a bit
let's say kau kerja government government based job
then lepas tu second job tak akan eh you cannot you cannot have two government jobs also what
to do the bake bake uh apa
uh apa ya so aku kerja full time abeh lepas tu
more income because you kau penat seh
bagi kamu pilih time or money aku pilih money pasal apa aku selalu broke
ya it's a very tough question lah that's like aku just like it sucks ah you gonna sacrifice ah kalau kau nak duit takde time kalau kau nak time kau takde duit
so kita penat
kalau nak link to suicidal thought suicidal rates also increase what
where last time they think that eh apa you suicide you depressed only it's like oh you're just stress
ya I think because one thing sekarang internet accessible what so ya it's easy then that time uh apa
projects school project aku apa kena search for mental health oh my god
the more I read because okay the thing is it's just not depression there's anxiety there's uh what panic disorders there's these disorders eh banyak sia disorder
and like the more I read is like thing kan dorang macam cross
cross link macam cross link gitu ah it's like it's so like when I read like eh am I reading about anxiety or am I reading about another another disease because it's like so similar but it's actually different oh my god and like macam when I read it is like
ha jijik the split
tak tak tak tak eh tak eh haiya
ya ya ya it's also a great exposure also lah then that time ah apa aku I don't know what was I doing when YouTube then like I wasn't supposed macam the feed eh ah no no not recommended I don't know lah
diagnose ah this woman and it was like old like macam eighties seventies so it was a black and white video
then you know how like that that that generation of people right like you know their voice especially for women okay ang moh ah mat salleh
dia dorang punya tone yang suara macam macam very like happy macam tu kan imagine that and then like
oi kata tipu
is tak betul
nanti ya
the going to the last part ah apa uh when the beast came out
ya the beast came out then the girl like was ready with the short gun kan then lepas begitu uh dia gitu err dia macam dia nak bunuh pe talking about pure and impure you know about that part
basically the girl has macam like history lah she got rape dia kena rape daripada uncle dia
when she was young then lepas tu when she grew up obviously dia macam loner bawa bloodshed rumah then lepas tu she I think she got suicidal thoughts lah she got self-harm so there were scars like
but normal girls because she he kidnapped three girls K one of it pure than the other two mereka macam popular kind then is like oh kau tak pure
kau macam tak kisah gitu pasal orang something like that ah
but when they showed the scars of the girl who's like oh you're pure because in a way is like dia tahu rasa sakit kau tak tahu rasa sakit that's why aku rasa dia pure daripada kau
okay I guess so it's gonna be the same thing maybe entah bah
wait wait wait so kirakan like you land in Singapore and then after that they give you the mask or like err
ya we top we we top the rank ah isn't it we we top the list for the the number of corona virus cases tu lah pasti
but by that time um we actually had we we we travelled quite a bit before like kita pergi Bangkok for like satu minggu holiday
even though like you know there were threats of um like you know this unknown virus being spread around lah tapi
we went to Japan habis habis lepas tu was like that was when it was more heightened initially we were like thinking nak pergi ke tak nak pergi ke tak pasal
dia pakai dia the kind macam dia pakai mask
habis like in the aircraft when you know when we are all confined in in a uh metal tube with like hundreds of um other people like he will refuse to wear dia punya mask and I'm like
aku tak faham so anyway
sorry so ya begitu lah but ya then after that it's like err
uh they took unpaid leave and then after that err I I I tanya dia orang lah like eh so what's the deal now are we are you getting fired or like are you staying on err what's the situation cause it's like
you know it's very uncertain then dorang cakap macam eh kau lucky sia kau um um you left at a very good time and then I'm like
but ya macam begitu ah and err like you I'm also looking for a job but getting there but the good thing is I'm studying
you do you remember that um the viral video that fiasco the whole Ateeqah Mazlan punya benda that was super funny
she need to gain sale you know technically okay I mean like you know she put she put her nose where it didn't belong so it kind of like macam padanlah muka dia
cause it's like I know I know like she means well but it's like why do you need to go and call up siapa is it or something is it I can't remember
ya habis tu apa macam like she called them and then she tries to get like answers from them dia macam nak dia berniat nak
dia I think I think her niat is not to like viral like be like isn't like to to make to close down home based business but it's more to like
spread awareness of like the current regulations that are in place um apa eh
uh like the current regulations that are in place mm related to home based business begitu
tak satisfy is like an understatement because dorang I mean like you know like melayu punya backlash is like next level dorang macam like oh err
err dia ni dia ni dia ni nak apa nak tutup
kan as in what do they say uh they said something about like err nak tutupkan err nak kacau periuk ah
periuk nasi orang something like that I don't know but it's so like ya it's well meaning but misplaced
dia macam kena dia tak kena pulau dia kena kecam dia kena kecam gila babi so funny
okay I did not think that it was our good friend Hadi pasal si
of course lah I mean like it it I mean he is an unsung hero I mean like during the whole like during COVID eh sorry during it's like people will stuck at home okay lepas tu diorang semua nak kena makan kan
and then half the time like for me my family everybody stuck at home so my mum macam frus
dia orang masih kerja like you know I mean they are adjusted out there you know I mean like more than uh more than ever and like
it's still a kerja ah kerja tu kerja lah but like you know
because it's like I had to leave for dinner after that but like they they they they featured like some macam
the apa tu barang barang for the err how do you say the the items for the supermarket kan
how how long is that show two hours is like dua jam I don't think you can like squeeze everything together lah
highly taxing job for example kan macam like in a family a a low income family of like for example dia punya anak dia err anak dia special needs kid
habis lepas tu the parents are like you know they got retrenched or something and then they're older habis dorang tak ada they don't have the means to go and rent a car and stuff like that there's still a lot of things to consider
people who are like who are eligible for like macam help because for whatever reasons they earn
more than like slightly more than the the particular um like income ceiling for example and then after that like macam err
a lot of thought in it but I just cannot encapsulate it in words so is like macam you know like when you when you read something and then you have thoughts
so is like ya I don't know and we talk about like a couple of different topics also sometimes so macam I guess
well not really as in like I I at school during circuit breaker circuit breaker's thirteen April right so it was a interesting time for me like err because err apa
and then after that they started to implement like a lot of different measures and then it was very leceh pasal like you know because
there were at least macam twenty people in the class then after that like err we
you know home based learning and then after that we were the only ones who are still not doing home based learning so macam kita very move very FOMO
and this was the very funny part so kita orang punya exams we  kita ada dua exam like
for for one research module and another one eh apa eh
we were revising and basically we were revising based on err what the exam usually entails lah macam like
like like ada ada open ended and stuff like that and you based on like going to school and sitting for the exams then COVID happened
err so that time nak like in the end we for the first time in my life actually I did an online exam can you imagine back in when I was working ah
uh there was one there was one module there was one module where they say it was closed book tapi kita orang macam like
eh get real lah kau ingat apa kita orang tak akan you know go on Whatsapp lepas tu kita text eh kau tahu tak what's this what's the answer for this but in
so it's like um basically we were err there are there are like three different kinds of exam so macam like open task
so macam like we get on we we all got go online lepas tu we all sit down together
buka tu link duduk for two hours ku duduk situ
kau buat tu err exam just like a normal exam tapi err ni in the comfort of your own home  begitu
well nothing because okay for that macam the time exam kan the time exam is like you cannot hire anyone to do it for you
so it's like it's the thing where I mean like ada forty eight hours exam that I had recently it was like
ha you memang betik
I enjoyed my life met so many many different people habis lepas tu like now err bila I'm like more settled a little in life sort of
but like for for uni it's a bit more difficult especially now pasal like err how to say this like um I'm much older than I was obviously
dia pandai tahu dia pandai she graduated from mass comm eh no she graduated from advertising
Ngee Ann similar course tapi dia punya dia punya
distracted tak tak boleh tahan so I had a project before just like macam like maybe two weeks ago ya so dia sibuk dengan dia punya boyfriend punya birthday
habis lepas tu dia punya kerja macam you know it's a group work
so nak kena betul betul nak kena duduk and then discuss lepas tu nak kena tulis apa apa in a powerpoint
presentation nak kena prepare pasal kita orang ada presentation and then after that we have to write a report also
two people writing the same report is a mess and a fact is is that kita kena buat like a very intensive research initially and then after that is like after that it's like more of like a solution finding kind of thing
I said to her okay you know what aku buat aku buat yang lit review punya part lepas tu yang lain lain semua kau boleh buat senang
so basically we had like a google docs where we had a dumping ground of like macam kita orang punya um information and everything
and then the only thing she needs to do is to just write the bottom part of the the the essay the report itu pun dia tak boleh buat
the fact the fact is like I ain't going to do that but as in like okay so dia boleh
dia boleh lah pergi mana mana like dia punya boyfriend dia punya twenty third birthday dia pergi prepare all the apa tu
gifts for him bagai can you imagine twenty three birthday presents
because is like even though when I was working tak ada chance my boyfriend has ever going to get X number of presents however old he is from me
itu part time just
we are online uh we doing online lessons right now kan so like half the time kita
um kita log-on like at 9 o'clock
us to participate know like you know breakout groups you know that kind of thing and leceh gila then I was like err
tak nak ah malas ah but like so basically like for how many weeks eight eight eight weeks um
still in my bed and then after that like when they are discussing then after that you know I'll try to make an effort to get off my bed and then after that duduk dekat atas meja lah and do my work
this semester so I macam like to be able to connect with them in a level err I mean like online everything is very cool
as in this particular Food Panda thing dia punya promo jer daripada dulu ke baru sekarang baru saja as in like err
entah lah
ha apa
kita boleh pergi pe Sentosa island or like pulau ubin ke pulau hantu ke like our friend went to pulau hantu what recently
itu itu next level I was
kejap now is like almost two o'clock ya I what's what's classes what are classes
eh thirty plus dollars compared to my twenty five thousand dollars is nothing okay diam sudah diam
no tak payah lah just stop jer
I don't know ugh I I don't have access to the the Whatsapp right now kejap eh
oh really wait wait am am I dekat now
still jauh eh
serious I'm very distant eh jap jap eh wait wait am I am I am I am I closer now
boleh lah eh
mine I would say ah alhamdulillah I'm I'm very grateful for the results cause I expected worse but I guess my lecturers were just being lenient ah
the usual physical examination like we had the the ya I mean usually we we uh our exam punya duration would be like three hours right
cause ya but but but but it's not the usual ah question answer kind of thing ah cause ya ya cause it's like um I'm taking it uh for this for this forty hours exam is like it's it's it's err what's the subject oh education secondary uh educational psychology nya subject so it's like
tu lah like err initially I was like
sorry sorry banyak kan aiya but
lima soalan jer lepastu saya harus jawab kan dalam masa empat puluh lapan jam ye puan-puan
is it macam like I I sound very distant
dengar oh faham faham
faham jer cause like
um apa tu
mm mm mm faham faham faham
bahasa melayu nusantara ya so ya I mean ya but you are taking level two right ya so ya so like she I mean it's good lah cause it's like monday until thursday
ya merdeka ya tu lah
uh cerita dia like it's about um cerita dia it's about like um this person
eh aku selama ni err dekat dunia aku aku
buat jahat jer tapi kenapa like ya tapi kenapa like she's quite dia macam like she's she's asking herself she's questioning herself like um tapi kenapa aku dekat the good place like shouldn't be ya macam like tak ke patut ya lah tak ke patut aku dekat the bad place ya but then turns out that
it's a funny show ya it's comedy it's like eh dia nya genre is like comedy
cannot ah eh ya I mean at times it's very macam cringey uh and very like cliche the storyline
ya ya ya ya it's it's done that time dorang baru habis like I think it's around
no no no no like finish for this season ah and like boleh show ah
ya so I think dia baru dia baru habis jer like this year
hmm let me think I tak tahu ah cause like you you tadi cakap kan you not easily impressed
takut eh macam dah I dah list everything dah like and then suddenly oh oh oh I mean like I have a full list of recommendations ah if you want
really ah like like I mean like what you usually do you you just scroll ke macam mana
mmhmm ah can can can at at times it can be like macam it can it can trigger your macam thoughts juga ah like macam
um faham faham I can see I can see ah ya ya ya ya
and they don't mind tau like they just put their macam opinion on the twitter out there and macam
to me it's so brave and it takes a lot of courage to do that I just cannot macam like imagine the the what the critics ah I mean I think the critics are like macam I think I I I'm usually macam scared about like
the critics or like how people will judge me after that ah basically like oh you have this kind of thought macam you know kind of thing but then ya I mean it has uh huh
can can macam there's something that stopping you kan macam err okay to me usually I would say
to me I will usually say um ya sorry to me I usually macam what's stopping me at the same time is like my baseless assumptions ah atau macam baseless thought faham ke macam I didn't do a lot of reading but this is what I thought so I'm not sure like if I should like express it you get what I mean
ya ya ya ya oh my god oh my god faham faham faham faham macam like oh you you have this kind of like ya ya ya
ya but ya I also like respect them ah like um I mean like ah as to what you said just now about like I mean let's say if macam somebody or someone doesn't really agree with that that that opinion of theirs
like they are able to actually discuss about it faham ke
like to me I think if I were to put something kan then if another person would reply then I would be so cuak already like macam okay so what should I answer now macam wonder like
kan kan kan like I wouldn't deactivate cause of that ah basically macam like I wouldn't deactivate twitter just cause I I know that like through twitter you can get uh like updates ah like and they talk about like this sensitive I mean like especially I mean the millennials right you know right
mm mm mm like macam it's very toxic eh why would they share but
true true ya I mean and how's instagram been for you though I mean ya instagram aplikasi instagram ya I mean like do you think it's overwhelming as well
tak eh
ya ya ya I mean like I think these days pun macam I asyik
tengok the my kawan rapat jer I mean like ya my kawan rapat punya stories jer mmhmm
oh faham faham faham like macam uh you can keep this to yourself ya ya ya ya
oh my god kan I mean like you tengok alisa dengan yusuf ya allah

I mean I think dia masing-masing ah dia masing-masing if you're okay with that then ya okay ah
why you diam seh ya ya ya ya true true true true

ya ya ya ya ya ya cause like I think ah also like the kakak the kakak is ah kakak tu macam at the same time I think like she's she tengah like focus on her kerja first ah
and the suami also like studying right tengah belajar so I think both of them have their own commitments ah macam first
ya taking it slow but then it was actually not that slow ah I think they they kenal for like tiga bulan
I don't know I don't know I can't remember how long they kenal ah but it was really I think I think it's less than a year dia for sure is like less than a year ah
ya cause they are being matchmake orang like matchmake them so ya
ah looking at my parents' situation no okay if kan I would kot l'm looking at my current status I I would I wouldn't I mean

tadi kita naik grab
my mum my sister actually nak beli makanan ah lah then dekat balik dia beli makanan okay lor
McDonald tu ah beli
takleh pause eh
as in what apa intersect
eh mana ada
maybe we cannot do podcast sia gini
ya we cannot do podcast gini like we just sit down and talk talk talk then
you have to talk about contents semua
podcast podcast is this one one hour imagine tiga jam
ya I don't have I don't have banyak cerita in my life ahmad ada banyak cerita
campak phone ke
nak McDonald nak bubble tea
macam-macam eh
but he only ya he die tingkap ni
this is not even the worst err same cousin same uncle ada kucing he got five cats
ya no no okay this one five cats but then but then once it's pass away dia new lah still got five now the recently one it's a bit sad
my dryer is very warm and cats like warm places so he go inside and macam lie down sleep ah
no dryer untuk untuk the clothes ya washing machine the circle thing
ya he always he don't know tak perasan no he just put the jeans inside he put jeans inside
tutup then ya start ah then he then
then he thought it was the jeans cause the jeans heavy what biarkan ah one hour
then no blood no blood then my my makcik my makcik open
shout lah basically nampak
very nice ah the cat very cute very very pretty err nama dia cleo
cleo cleo cleo tu lain cleo macam cleo macam cleopatra gitu like kat egypt
kesian know
but that's one thing err why can't it just meow already lah cry for help sometimes the cats kalau sakit
what are you doing bukan how are you doing
oh ya I forgot how is your haus kau batuk lagi ke
mm cause aku perasan juga like I notice your cough in your um videos I notice that your voice is like almost gone you know and um and also like when you have kahak in your throat and then you like you need to clear it before you talk then I'm like why is she speaking like this why is she not um clearing her throat first before she talk
kenapa dia ni macam gini kenapa dia kenapa dia tak dia tak rasa sakit ke and then turns out that you've been having bad coughs like for a long time so how is it is it better now that you started your medication
susah tak nak pakai tu like how did you know how to use it did you like Google it because if it was me I would have to Google it
oh I think I think I saw that but I think I saw that like lambat
orh kalau tak kau macam tak boleh nak nak inhale like deeply ah
must be hard because actually now I'm better but I think when I was in school pun I used to have bad coughs yang dia tak teruk tapi dia lama
I have kahak so I have a lot of kahak that goes in my throat and then also in my nose like in this area so dia macam satu it's the same thing where it's like all over the place
ah so macam sekarang ni I can recognize it lah when I'm having when I'm having a sinus allergy reaction
macam at that time I think I didn't know cause ah before
actually err is a lot better that I can eat chocolate now the only thing I'm not eating right now is um tempeh
err roti kicap
I know I know no but ya I think these three yang betul betul I've been avoiding because
err at first memang I avoided everything I avoided like vitagen yakult lah yogurt I mean I still don't eat yogurt ah apa tapi macam kalau yogurt is in mm is like a flavor aku boleh makan tapi macam tak banyak lah
dia is is in at yeast allergy it's like um err fermentation is fermentation because
because yeast kan is a product of fermentation ah so macam tempeh pun aku tak boleh makan because it's like soy bean fermented
ya macam tu sebab lah is it's hard for me sometimes to detect what I can or cannot eat because macam tu lah because uh in some kadang-kadang aku makan
err apa gatal but actually you know uh when I went to clinic my it was really bad my skin was in bad condition because I just got like new macam active err areas yang gatal and everything
and he asked me if I started to eat any vitamins recently and I did I started because before that I had a very bad ah episode of sinus punya ni like selsema for like one month
so my dad told me to start err drinking yang effervescent tablets tu barakah
so I did and then he ask me I started err started drinking that and then he said that oh ya it's very bad padahal kan I look at the ingredients of the vitamin and it doesn't say anywhere that it contains um macam yeast ke apa but I guess is one of the by products when they make it
err so err tapi recently because I at first I memang betul betul jaga my diet and then I notice at this one time okay at this time is funny at that time it was like very very bad
but my aunt she forgot that I cannot eat kicap because kicap is such a common common thing kalau kau masak kan
so dia
ya ya no at that time she's making nasi goreng sambal sotong tau like leftover sambal sotong so dia letak lah kicap tu sikit just for flavour
and then I was I already ate like one full plate and then she's like aina I'm just like but I don't know how I don't remember how but she said that she put kicap and I was like
tapi I was already but you know I can I have medicine to help with the itching so malam tu aku macam aku dah ready lah untuk makan ubat
so at that bad macam is just a little bit because when my skin is not dry so the gatal pun dia kurang lah I can control it so when err after that I realise that you know I should try to because it's been
so macam I should start
trying out food yang I'm not eating
so I I drank like vitagen once and it was okay tapi aku kurang lah I don't make it a habit to drink it a lot
ah cuma sekarang ni aku tak makan roti
err kicap tempeh yogurt jer lah
actually supposed to go and see the doctor bulan enam but at that time kan I was ah I couldn't go because clinic tu dekat tangkak
ya tangkak kat johor but it's far lah
you know why because is betul betul dekat hujung
betul betul dekat hujung dekat singapore like really is like there
so macam
because especially because my house is err dekat danga bay which is
and then my window is facing the um memorial the sungei that goes like I can see the boats the fishermen boats ada kelong and then I can actually see the island of singapore in the distance
ya tapi I'm I didn't go to singapore I've never been to singapore
I used to because when I was younger kan mm kalau kitaorang balik johor
I and my parents and like their cousin and their siblings kan dorang semua dah ready bawa passport cause they would go for a not even a day trip dorang nak pergi kat dorang cari um like the juice fruit juices that are not here in malaysia some of the products juice juice
dorang some some ah dorang tak produce dorang tak hantar that brand dekat malaysia
so they will go there macam is a trip for them and then kitaorang budak-budak would be left at home it's like freedom for both adults and kids
we'll all be like so jealous wah tak dapat ikut pergi singapore and then I realize and I got older and I realised that singapore dengan malaysia takde beza
sama jer kan sebenarnya
ya it's the same I think ya sama jer it's just that you know at that time I was like wow singapore
ah that's why it's at first it was hard for me because the memang my family memang suka makan roti kitaorang we can go through like one bantal yang besar tu like two days so now substitute is wraps lah
mm so macam always ada tu or you know like prata yang frozen
ah kalau if I go to AEON I will buy the croissant
croissant croissant itu memang one of the benda yang paling kelakar
because kau dah terbiasa
ya apa
kan cousin aku kan belajar
tunggu jer lah lunch is almost lunch time
usually kau yang masak ke
um I think dia tak not used to the routine yet but as a experience based on my experience is a very good
err routine to have to moisturize and when I say moisturize kan it's not it's not just um sapu lotion on dry skin you have to be bilas with water first and then you have to pat dry and then baru you lotion because then baru dia ada moisture
ah ya ya tapi macam you know if I if I mandi awhile like
wear it bilas and then I put lotion and then is very effective kalau you moisturize it overnight
dia sendiri dia tak pandai jaga that's why you know when I was
mm but when I was younger and it was bad memang my mom would paksa
err because sometimes it hurts tau untuk mandi cause when you have open sores and then my mum would force and she would watch me
so macam masa tu kan I
ah tak tak
yang ini yang yang aku makan ni dia powder tapi dia dalam capsule
ah and then eh that time I cannot I couldn't eat pills I couldn't swallow pills pasal kau tahu uh sampai menangis like I tried to eat it until I cried
I open the capsule onto a spoon lepastu aku makan
it's disgusting tapi
maybe you should try you know work yourself up you know potong tiga ke to get used to it instead of makan powder jer
tapi dia macam faulty lah
can jap I give you the link cause I just gave it to darren but it's like
it's like uh after I register tak boleh nak log in pun
tak tahu lah dia punya website dia macam faulty tu yang si nai cakap semalam dengan doctor john
ah you when you register to use your apa punya account
try lah nanti apa I think they need to um solve on their site before they do before you can log in
I get it I get it lah but thing is kat you need like a car
ah tu jer lah I think that's that's really the only macam problem that I have
ah itu jer lah tak banyak pun tapi they haven't responded to my email
aku dia ada dia ada dia macam err inquiry box dekat website tu
ah so I I left my email and then the topic was internship and that if they receive um interns undergraduate internship apa ya program
tapi dorang tak reply maybe I need to email them directly
ya actually I I agree dorang punya one of the malaysia punya government or any authorities when punya weak link weak point is that dorang punya website is very poorly handle
ah bukan tak pandai they don't see the need
ah macam kita kan apa-apa pun kita akan website dulu ah website website
so tapi aku cari lah kat johor kat johor pun banyak juga
more opportunity banyak tempat but it's definitely gonna be far from my house lah
tapi okay lah as long as you know
yes apa ni apa aku cakap oh when I was in second year
I did go to aquaria kan aku pergi dengan shikin
and I saw um some of the stuff dia tengah macam recording record of the the fish and the the thing in the tank
macam like writing on the clipboard so aku tanya dia aku tanya dia uh kalau apa dorang ambil aquaria ni ambil intern ke lepastu dia kata dia pun intern
ya and then she said that uh apa I ask lah yang selalunya yang feeding kan yang diving and feeding tu dia kata anyone that has a diving license boleh I'm like ah
ah tu lah I wonder also
jauh lah tapi it's either you have a long commute atau you sewa rumah dekat situ lah sewa bilik
kau tahu tak fasha fasha nak buat intern kat johor
sebab uh ya lah but she wants to be close with shami dia nak jumpa lah
so this so kita orang macam dah pernah cakap sebelum ni that if she gets an internship in johor I would I mean if we get in the around same area
ha mari mari tapi johor ni kan besar so we don't know lah
mm mm tak tahu kat mana tu jer ah when I think that
macam is I'm so scared
I saw because I did see my brother going through his internship pun susah gila nak cari no no company would want
mm tapi
tapi I did see some private companies yang bagi internship not bad lah
takde I'm trying to find material for my tapi
I don't know if I can just use the paper that my supervisor bagi like
dia dia kan my old title was combining water quality dengan uh macromentoes
so I did my field work tapi since we cannot go to the lab
dia dah published dah tapi dia co author jer dia bukan the main author doctor chan lepastu dia ada data dekat tempat yang sama of macromentoes so aku kena analyse the data of macromentoes compare it to the published paper punya data
dia punya paper as a reference for my water quality part
um I think I have a I think I have an idea of how to do it lah tapi you know ha I actually finding the material for me is the hardest part
macam aku aku try the system where when I read I highlight the paragraph
pastu I go back to it and then aku akan copy paste for the whole paragraph I go I put it in my word document
pastu I try to retype it
tapi sometimes it becomes macam disjointed because you know you're taking a lot of sources and make it into one paragraph
sometimes it feels bad tapi tu lah gunanya supervisor
oh laju kali ni supervisor kau laju
last sem aku rasa macam supervisor aku jer yang asik minta ya your supervisor was so quiet
sebab haritu kan kitaorang ada meeting mentor mentee kan dengan doctor chan
uhh macam on the our presentation dia cakap
the examiners all are impressed dengan kita punya presentation
pasal our presentation wise we are all macam mantul tapi when it comes to the writing
ah writing kita ada macam slack
I think must me and my feelings pun macam gitu macam
mm sometimes aku rasa macam oh my god is he like mad at me or is he like not not so not satisfied with it tapi sebenarnya okay jer
is like we you know we have in this other lecturer yang uh
ah and tapi aku rasa macam my supervisor and your supervisor they are not the kind to dismiss that kind of questions dorang akan jawab
cause I I've had experience with it before because I did ask stupid questions ya lah sebab kita nak tahu kan we I'm I was scared of doing the wrong thing when I was going on my field trip
ah memalukan like you feel embarrassed
yang dekat terengganu eh
did you hear about the girl kat terengganu
ah yang kawan ah
wei tu gila dah
ye lepas lepastu dia boleh Whatsapp lagi macam acting as if like nothing
eh bukan bukan mak dia ada kat situ ke
mm macam ramai kan orang punya story macam banyak version
kesian dah like
wife dah lah sakit lepas tu anak dia yang anak dia yang first kan
but it's so sad lah tapi memang
ada video evidence kan that she entered the house
mm dengan apa I think like hair in her hand
tak boleh log in kan
dah tu lah I think you just wait ah because think somewhat tak boleh tak boleh
I think someone did text the yang apa doctor jaga situ puan puan lin eh
aku tak tolong masak aku tolong dia basuh jer
kan dia macam semak
orh dia panggil okay ah
my mum doesn't ask us to help kalau dia tengah masak
ah macam after tu I usually just go and see lah tapi dia kadang-kadang dia minta lah minta tolong
aku pun tapi aku kurang lah because aku kan tengok drama yang aku tengah tengok ni bukan dekat netflix
so macam is a lot of more steps to
to watch it tapi sebab you know K drama they are so long
macam kau kena tengok tu kau kena duduk situ for an hour to watch it
I didn't watch that because I saw a lot of people punya comments
but I think the K drama yang I watched that had a lot of err long episodes was prison playbook
itu kan I don't usually watch uh slice of life punya drama
I usually watch macam investigative atau medical tapi somehow prison playbook ni
it's interesting and dia kelakar
dia cam just a nice balance of kelakar dan sedih ye dia kelakar more kelakar than sedih
best tapi tu lah ada episode dia yang one one and a half hours
ni pun kalau sejam aku rasa dah lama dah
sebab you know I'm used to watching um english
english punya series english punya series paling lama pun like forty minutes jer
and then kalau comedy kalau comedy tu
lagi lah twenty minutes twenty minutes jer
that's where I really like pick up on spoken english because I used to read a lot tapi macam tak bercakap lah kan
so when I watched it I pick up on the slang and the the the pop culture the references macam inside jokes
ya dah you know masa tu kan dia kat dalam dia kat channel hallmark
and it was at eleven forty five at night every episode baru
so macam my mum was um was very strict with this about bed times ah usually macam ten tu we're ready to go to sleep
so we only me and my sister lah my oldest sister kitaorang akan sneak out untuk tengok
I don't know ah sometimes dia perasan kot tapi dia macam biar jer
I think my parents do that a lot when we were kids so that you know biar jer lah macam
let us get away because sometimes kita kena belajar lah to be
especially because kitaorang kan ramai there's like six of us
ah benda macam ni is like a small thing let it go lah
I used to macam tu lah my sister and I would break um bed time
a lot sebab kitaorang nak baca buku nak tengok
baca buku yang I don't know time at first it was bagus you know but then after a while we really like bought a lot kalau kitaorang pergi big bad wolf or sale yang like ten bucks
and then we would have nowhere to simpan and then the worst part is that we have books yang we haven't read but we want to buy new
ah banyak jer sampai sekarang tak baca
tapi my mom dah simpan semua buku dekat my grandma's house punya store so kalau nak cari balik kena cari dalam store tu but I read books on my phone now
wei kau nak dengar tak aku punya mimpi yang paling aku ingat sekarang dan paling merepek
anak dia pun ramai tau anak dia like wait eh one five or six tapi semua boys
uh the oldest one it's like us around the same age lah cuma the last one the last one beza dengan the second last one was like twelve years or something like that
uh the last one is still is still young still a child still a kid like primary school but the second youngest is our age I think so dorang handsome tau
pernah aku pernah mimpi I was marrying marrying one of them but but it's not
ya this is this is is my dream but I often memang get err
often memang get a really bad not really bad not bad dreams but they just like very weird dreams because
aku jarang tak mimpi then
yang macam banyak kali one of it I can remember is that daripada aku dulu daripada aku kecil tau masa aku dah pandai drive lagi I always dream
that's like daripada dulu lagi I've been having that that one specific dream
sampai I can imagine it now
tapi actually I
I think it's interesting tapi most of the time
I don't really remember unless I betul betul put in effort untuk remember I won't remember
ah I will that's why sometimes I wake up and I'm in a bad mood is because I had a dream yang
made me ah macam you know it's a bad feeling
apa yang what was
I don't know I don't know why we are in our last semester tapi our lecturer wants to
mm mm tu lah
sabar jer lah
bedah pun did you see her tweet
no did she replied me she said there is someone who replies the list responds to the list in a group pastu aku macam oh okay aku dah tahu dah siapa
tapi dia dapat lagi sorang siapa ah
cuma dua orang tu jer
not sure I remember dua orang tu jer lagi sorang tu I tak ingat pula wait ah I see I got I send you the picture right
cause kesian
mana eh nama dia oh ni oh dia dengan okay lah
sorang tu jer lah that's like really bad
tapi tira punya group macam best cause she got
ah cas dengan tarvin
cuma cuma sorang tu jer yang macam eh sikit
alah dia start march kan
march kita start tak tak kita start intern in march
ya march sampai july
adoi so kau kena your intern has to be there lah
orh boleh kerja ke tak
ah err january tapi
dah prepare I mean they are preparing but I don't know how much they can prepare now that cannot ah selangor tengah kan
dia macam I I asked my mum because even dorang punya engagement pun they postpone
so I asked my mom if it's still uh is still like enforce at that time and tak boleh nak buat tak boleh nak buat kenduri
my mum said nikah jer lah dulu and then kenduri we can think about it later
ya tapi dorang dah ada lah dewan apa semua they have already corresponded dengan that person for now they are planning as if there's gonna be an actual wedding
aku rasa but but because
err we know the guy we are friendly with him ya I used to do it with him so aku rasa macam I don't feel like
ah apa I don't feel like I'm losing her lah sangat
ah and then he's nice I mean we argue a lot tapi kitaorang gaduh manja manja jer because I think we have the same like almost similar personality
ah it's like we are both the opinionated and then kitaorang memang minat benda yang sama like we
apa semua so I can talk to him lah about and he's very friendly even to my family
mm casually talk to him so it's nice tapi macam you know my sister getting married
the last one tu supposed to be lelaki but
keluar perempuan so dia tak balance
but I'm grateful because I am right now macam paling rapat with my younger sister
because you know being the youngest she matures a lot more than kitaorang
form four lepastu tak tak matrix
dia adik aku yang last tu dia sorang jer dalam sekolah
kita orang semua dah ni dah
yang aisyah tu
pasal yang atas dia laki eh
tapi kalau kau tengok the difference between my sibilings I always post their pictures

oh tapi rambut dia sekarang dah tak tegak dah rambut dia dah leper a'ah comel gila
I don't know I miss them cause dah lama tak jumpa
best dia makan semua benda especially fruits
dia basically kau suap apa pun dia buka mulut
and then kalau macam my sister duduk atas kerusi kan pastu dia kat bawah and she's like she's standing then my sister holding a fruit and then dia akan tries so hard untuk panjat my sister's legs
adoi tapi dia dah pandai lah main and then she doesn't like cats like you
she's scared of cats kalau kitaorang video call kan and then I'll be like meow meow then dia macam huh where's that coming from where's that coming from dia takut then sekali kitaorang nak kasi dia pegang kucing dia pegang dia peluk aku kuat kuat gila she's so scared
mm aku rasa pukul enam eh

so um like recently he talk to me again like I was it was after like my birthday so like he wish me then became like a like a weekly a weekly talk like we we tend to talk macam weekly so like there was more conversations happening ah
um haprak lah sis no lah eh

that one is not my teman lelaki
that one is my ex lah K bekas lah sis bekas bekas
okay it's correct yes yes so basically my friend like jumpa dia on like lah then the best part is my friend my friend match with him to see just to to to have like you know just just match

I know like I pernah do that also to my friend but this is legit legit this is legit this is legit so it happened to me pun okay okay kita kita kita is like sama kita sama okay me and my friend but this is a this is different friend okay

oh banyaknya
so um we actually met at bugis so then we went to walk around at bugis junction first because we want cause uh we want cause we met late afternoon so we decided to not we decided he ajak me go solat at masjid sultan
so we went to walk around first then around me six fifty then we made our way to masjid sultan then you know now got the safe entry staff so we cannot really um masuk early kan so we had to waste our time first before we go to masjid then
then um like a few days later like he had a bad he got bad news that his friend meninggal
ya that's one thing like okay I'll give him space cause like you know orang tu baru meninggal kan
aku tak expect kau to be like
I always confront him when like I feel that it's too much or something I always confront and I always tell him macam
like at that point in time aku tak cakap apa-apa cause
honestly that last conversation kan he dia minta maaf cause um dia tahu yang apa macam
he he knows he's in the wrong ah kirakan then he apologize then I was like okay since you apologize you brought up the matter yourself pe so I included my own thoughts about that matter ah
over that maybe my words or something I don't know lah but it's just like macam I feel like he could have
if kalau dia datang balik kan
I don't know kalau jodoh jodoh
it's not fair or tak boleh ah macam what the what the hell is this but at that point in time I wanted to confront him about him not talking to me but at the same time I'm like but he's mourning his friend so I gave him the space but I occasionally check up on him so
yes ya and also macam
when I think bila fikir balik kan
um datang balik pun
if really then I'll give in ah but if not then malas ah

location penting but
provided let's say there's no more COVID there's no kan macam we can still go down and like there's a lot of eateries museum
hey okay firstly it is not a sports mall a sports mall is actually dekat novena which is to velocity
right secondly it is a mall for all ages and all people from all walks of life so kalau let's say you're a foodie there's lot of places
to go to let's say you are very hip and you like there's a place for you too and let's say you are you are someone yang macam suka
macam gini ah
I am stating the facts of the funan mall and I am I like that mall I mean you dah pernah pergi dia punya rooftop right and the views from there thanks to me who brought you what do you say about that

but actually kalau view from the top of parliament is actually lawa juga cuma I think only special people or special circumstances allows you to use the drone macam gitu ke
but wah kalau
your drone kena shoot down seh kalau you fly
mm betul juga
I just read this article um one of the big hotel chains also tak ingat apa nama hotel itu ah so they are offering

what I feel is that the mothership feels like SGAG kind tapi they are more seniors I tak pasti
is this going to be a funny answer ataupun serious answer
okay I'll make a guess mungkin SGAG
well as compared to my point of view macam I follow both SGAG and mothership on their social media so
wow so old fashion macam zaman-zaman dulu bapa bapa
tapi checkers macam
wait dam
oh dam lah okay okay

so let's say ada dua player right so I'm player one you're player two so I
put my pieces on the black boxes tapi you put the pieces on the white
okay faham faham
you cannot move back tapi boleh move forward
ya betul itu

or certain um outlets sahaja
eh jangan gitu lah
kita boleh cakap english dengan melayu jer tau okay
oh my god talking about mister softee now I feel like eating ice cream macam mana ini walao

um when I was in school macam doing research on like economists and economic crisis
ya when we're younger there was this thing happening macam at that point of time we don't feel it lah obviously cause we too young
to experience it tapi
but I guess it's a silver lining right like you know the way you guys are now anyway so macam more comfortable
ya do they still find it macam alien when you
travel to other parts of singapore macam cause you don't know the place well and stuff cause for example like me kan kalau
I drive up to the east especially for with myself or with myself pula on my own
with my parents et cetera macam it feels very alien
I pergi tempat lain gitu it's not somewhere that I'm comfortable with actually unless macam
no other places in singapore make you feel janggal like out of place except sembawang
macam you make your own decisions and stuffs
levels like what period in time of your life macam you
five years five right lima
no dark past I'm digging out from you you're safe okay tak zilch

you literally just nak leave singapore just for the sake of it after all this
rehat and relax at the R&R

okay okay ya singapore kecil apa statewide sia
actually singapore if you know kalau kita nak divide into you want to think as if of state right how would it be though
you know prior to his discovery of singapore right malaysia doesn't exist apa
ya no pasal dulu orang melayu banyak like the population is a lot
but then what happened what telah happen
eh but we should go makan soon ah lama tak makan sia like proper punya makan
eh bro I almost selalu tengok confirm like almost everyday ah aku pergi YouTube then search burger ke or like steak punya cooking videos
dorang like starting jer the they got all the items or like at first you know they buy all these kind of stuff then as
quite sick ah that one then I got see yang dorang restore dia punya samurai punya sword kan sick sia
oh that one actually kena ada license ah dulu dulu when secondary school tak payah aku tahu kau tahu Otaku House
dulu kan
tak dulu ada dulu secondary school aku dengan kawan aku selalu pergi beli macam
is it tiga hajat apakah hajat-hajat itu
oh cannot lah that one is too gila okay maybe I start first
if I got three hajat the first one would be I want to talk to my kucing
cause because I just like like every time I always like talk to my kucing and then I I become like a gila person and I like berbual merepek I legit like talk like my kucing is my kawan
so if I if I can actually talk in cat language maybe my kucing will talk back to me
but macam fun lah
alamak if macam tu then
but I want to like faham what my cat is talking or like what my cat is thinking
if you get to like pilih if you can only travel to the future or to the past
like kalau I'm given a chance to travel back right I want it to like
just be macam what's that like you just watch like you cannot do anything to change
ya I tak nak apa tu I don't want to travel to the future
cause I takut that if I see macam what my future is
macam I risau lah that my what my actions will
oh ya that's true but okay example lah if if in the future I see that I become doctor and then abeh I I don't know I
okay no no no change change change okay in the future I see that I'm something that I don't want to be macam engineer ke
or cikgu then I'll be like oh okay okay ah try to like then I'll try to do something that won't make me like a cikgu
but actually like in the end also like I don't know then it will affect my like what I'm doing right now lah and then macam tak ada thrill if I know that in the end I'll become doctor then
then I'll be demotivated to study cause I know my future like okay lah later I become a doctor so tak payah belajar banyak sangat
tapi fun lah
cause macam sleeping takes up so much of your time you know my cikgu always say that oh kalau example if you sleep like like okay for imagine if you sleep macam eight hours a day
that means like your whole hidup right you only if you are sixty years old that means you sleep for like one third of your
so he say like just sleep like empat jam cukup lah tak payah tidur banyak-banyak
then I fikir also like betul lah
but if I tidur
sikit sangat also I also ngantuk
ya ya I understand okay how about like tak rasa ngantuk
okay how about tidur sekejap tapi can still work the next day
feel like sleeping legit bazir my masa
oh I faham
makan so much gula
and all the merepek food
abeh I think I think
cause my ibu and my ayah they dia orang got diabetes lah okay not my ayah my ibu
ya I a bit takut but at the same time tak kisah lah
and cut down on the gula-gula
oh wait no maggi goreng
no ada indomie and maggi eh mi sedaap
actually I last time legit suka eh ibumie
ya sedap but then
I don't know why everyone say indomie so I like oh oh okay okay sama sama lah indomie indomie also
the flavour macam lain sikit right
it's like lain sikit
mi sedaap they legit like tak lokek their bawang
but their bawang a bit macam
weird lah cause their bawang is bulat-bulat
it's I don't know it's bulat-bulat and then when you gigit right like sometimes it's so keras
kan maybe it's like bawang but
covered with tepung
so it's just like they goreng the bawang already
oh I tadi I eat uh briyani
okay lah tapi macam apa banyak sangat apa tu minyak
daging I don't like
what the wait they jual where
I I want to like tahu what like what others are thinking about me
I feel like pelan-pelan I will I will adapt to it
and like what you know during the time I go up to to to aqil to ask for the gambar
and then imagine I I tahu what he's thinking
and then legit like if if like he tengah fikir something bad about me I'll probably like okay tak payah gambar then go back
actually takde power yang
yang I don't know
is ada hikmahnya that
um ada udang sebalik ini semua
tak pernah eh
I legit tak pernah dengar
apa eh let me think
if macam if you don't simpan the benda right you won't even remember that it used to exist
then you don't really rasa anything
so maybe sometimes macam lebih baik lah if you don't already have it
what is the one okay wait I read in malay also okay sabar sabar eh
okay apakah alasan yang paling remeh yang menyebabkan anda tidak suka pada seseorang
alasan that is paling like is okay
I can think of one alasan that is very remeh
the alasan is like is that maybe dia orang punya suara is a bit weird like if it's macam you know like if you dengar like someone speaking and you can know that they're just so annoying
by the way macam entah eh tak tahu macam mana nak explain
ya faham kan ya tapi like that's macam legit merepek lah
kan kan macam nak sepak jer kan
but sometimes is just macam salah anggap salah judge
ya that's why it's like legit remeh merepek
wah that one I tak boleh angkat also
ya kadang-kadang macam geram nak tolong angkatkan kaki dia orang ke
apakah genre drama atau rancangan yang paling anda gemari
maybe can macam berbual pasal a recent um drama you watched
you want to mulakan dulu
I think I faham a bit
is it macam
okay it's not really genre lah but okay as you know lah I suka like anime like recently like I watch a lot of anime
like why I like anime is cause the apa tu the characters legit macam cute gila and you know like they're like the the guys
they !alamak! I don't know how to explain they are so handsome
and okay like handsome tu satu lah but and then they they are macam they are so perfect also
ya and ya and macam kat singapore you got like you cannot find anyone macam tu and so like ya lah like anime
it's like very fun to watch cause they are also cartoons so faham-faham lah it's like
ya and some more can beli all of their stickers or baju and stuff
and usually the anime their their plot macam very exciting and very fun lah cause it's not like real life so there's banyak
you can tambah benda merepek that doesn't make sense or something that isn't macam logical in real life
and it will still be bagus
kan macam
eh just ask me I can tolong ask rina also
I added I follow your adik and she legit so funny
oh my god my adik also you know my adik is like like very young
and he type macam legit like budak zaman sekarang like you know you know how you type macam oo whoa whoa
and the thing is he's a lelaki you know so when like sometimes I I tengok they way he type or he hantar me message and I legit sometimes macam a bit disgusted
ya and and his macam ejaan is lain you know like you know when you um eja like no is N O he eja like N U U U U U so it's nuuuuu
ya sometimes you must apa tu enjoy the moment tak boleh cepat sangat lah kadang-kadang we cepat sangat nak grow up then we put in like so much effort
to not macam live your age and then in the end also you regret
you want to bertitik tolak to another question
if duit is percuma then
I want mm I want bubble tea to be percuma
then I can rasa I can rasa all the different flavours
because sekarang I just keep buying the brown sugar fresh milk
you know I baru beli the sandals right
and then tadi I keluar lah I went ikea and apa tu it was like a bit scary cause I don't know I don't know why like when I pakai the sandals it feels like like high heels or something
ya ya and I takut it will cabut so I was like I was like trying to macam walk slowly and it looks a bit weird my mother was like eh jalan betul-betul lah
don't know cause apa tu sebelum tu I had uh one pair of rubi shoes and it actually like lasted quite lama lah
ya cause kadang-kadang it's only until forty
that's a bit kesian
oh oh my god I benci when when like they always look at me like I want to curi something
if it's just what like how I'm acting I think I was acting macam biasa jer
tapi legit menyampah
maybe they kena force to do it
actually kan if they if they tak cakap welcome then that means they just diri kat situ and stare at you so maybe that's why they welcome welcome
oh I did I did okay apa ah I actually just bought like baju
and seluar and kasut ah cause like tak ada banyak benda that I need and I
I'm actually cause I look at my wardrobe and like I got so many baju that I don't really pakai all the time
and it's like I simpan it's just cause I simpan cause I sayang you know I don't want to I don't want to buang
then I keep macam telling myself dah tak apa lah next time can use but
I don't actually pakai it lah so so I like
chose some baju that I want to give away and I'm giving away to rina cause she
she tanya lah ya and then but from eleven eleven ah what
I bought two jeans one white one black then I also beli ah two blouse ya one white and then is another blouse and then I also bought skincare which is apa tu ya
ya ya correct and the kasut lah
the hitam one the kasut is actually very nice
I actually nak pergi typo cause I want to buy some stuff from typo
ya tapi macam jauh ah cause I baru eh I pindah right
I pindah like from last two years I used to live nearer to like JEM but now I live like nearer to jurong point
ya if you naik the lah
you mean lampu raya
I want to apa tu volunteer
but like you know I tadi I went to the volunteer dot website and like most of the places like the volunteer places are like at the east eh
eh I I tak faham why I always so penat
like I sleep for apa like dua belas jam also I still can be so penat
wait you bangun pukul berapa
so actually I bangun pukul I bangun pukul lapan and then I
uh I tried to do stuff until pukul dua belas then pukul dua belas I went out mm I went out to ikea
macam chemical
entah it's like cause it's soya right
oh oh it used to it used to be apa tu from macam animals ah like dairy products but then now they change it to vegan
then macam tak sedap lah
ya actually macam takde apa-apa nak buat kat situ
tapi tadi I went there right and there was only like families
macam takde takde orang pergi dating ke takde budak-budak
mmhmm kan eh we also going skating right I a bit takut cause I tak tahu macam mana nak skate and then
okay dulu lah when I was like kecil like very young long time ago I I use the skates like the the that skates lah the fat one the wheels are very fat right
ya and then I jatuh you know and then I didn't skate anymore
no no no it's the roller blade the apa tu the roda is tajam right but then the skate the skating the indoor skating that we're going is the roda is like roundish and fat
so I a bit takut to go skating
I just tarik all of you down
I I think the the apa tu yang the round wheels right is harder to balance
ya cause like example ah you diri and then if you diri too straight then you can jatuh eh
ya you can jatuh backwards or if you sandar right you can jatuh also that's how I jatuh last time
oh my god I don't even kemas my bilik
I want to beli you know the like the mirror that is like panjang
but I also want to install you know kipas on the wall cause my kipas now is kat lantai
like cause I need to tarik my kipas everywhere cause
I'm panas then sometimes tertrip on the wire over the wire ya and my kipas also tak kuat sangat
cause now our window grille kan like we need to pasang the the mesh if not like our kucing can escape
ya so we want buy the grille that is like tak besar sangat so the kucing can like no need cannot escape lah
and we no need to pasang the mesh cause now like we all the windows got the mesh
ya no no no it's only the top and then the mesh like tangkap all the bulu
ya so we malas to bersihkan so we just change the window
eh when we keluar on the nineteen we should go to fatburgers
fatburgers ya is a apa tu sign
I think huda want to makan fatburger
no but apparently it's sedap
kat ang mo kio ada I think
oh ya kan kan tapi COVID so tak banyak ah
ya ya that time also I go then like a bit kosong and it was ya I think it was a weekend also cause usually banyak orang sampai tak boleh jalan or something ya but it was kosong ah
apa eh jap
you have one child but you have another one percuma oh
huh that's that's a bit gila
actually twins twins a bit fun when you grow up how many anak you want to have
your apa tu parents very cute
I mean they still muda
my my ibu and ayah they kahwin when they were twenty eight
ya and it's actually my my ibu still schooling cause she
she join like madrasah lambat lah and then she want to like continue islamic studies
so like like she like she never even kerja after she kahwin eh after she kahwin pula she never kerja after she like belajar
so after she belajar which is like she finish twenty eight then my ayah already macam apa simpan duit for how many years already so he sponsor everything
he sponsor the majlis the honeymoon all and then they kahwin at twenty eight but then they ambil like four years to get like my abang
so like they got my abang at thirty two
and you know they tunang for how long
they tunang for six years
dekat huh ya usually orang tunang apa dua tahun
eh I want to kahwin someone baik someone baik someone kacak someone
kalau boleh lah tapi tak boleh kan takpe
can ask nabilah nabilah got buat tu before
you want to berhenti here
how cause I very like macam my friends also like I buka ah
continue ah your story curi how how did he get away with that
the audacity adik curi daripada bapa
macam mana you dapat though
I think some kedai like some shop they will ask some shops tak kesah that one best kalau like if your muka then they like ya ambil lah wah
how I cannot I don't know like I got like macam masih you know ya
like I go I my I sprained my ankle then got like headline fracture then I kind of cannot play sports now then like I feel very insecure like you know because the thing is right macam pasal body like when you are like bigger in size but then you you play sports or what but then when you play sports what did I say oh ya then I stop ah cause I fracture then like the thing is like you know when you are bigger in size
and then but then like when you tak buat apa-apa then like they will just keep on attacking you the same you know like just now we talked about all the aunties seventy year old is like what the hell dude but then you like when you have something macam like if you dance dance is also a sport right or play other sports they will like not say or like you can will just skip one or thirty you wanted to say you know like just now we talk about
say something back but then ya makcik makcik sekarang tak tahu like ya they not it's like bukan tegur it's like menyindir then I'm like wow oh really ah your parents like that
especially in front of other relatives tu aku sakit hati betul oh my god correct not even secretly that is oh my god ya
I am not saying why but like I rarely meet my friends or like girls in general that want motor right ya most of them nak kereta I mean like ya oh sorry I don't know what I mean I don't understand like
then he like at least you got there ya so sorry ah I quite shocked ah but alhamdulillah at least he got there I mean macam token you got hear that before the token malay like what were we talking about again
I heard people are not like some other girls cannot take it then like you know you just risau then like if talking about the context as a female but like if you are also not gonna say cause you are under a superior macam tukar macam sergeant kau then kalau nak buat benda like he can macam threaten you
ya okay I think I agree also but then the thing is I'm not trying to say that we are as women are not strong or what it's just like K we can macam move on to the topic of like the whole like sexism misogynistic ideology in singapore like do you do you nampak the news baru keluar like ah this chinese man
dia freaking like molest budak kecil perempuan and like upskirt and then he just got like seven months probation the thing is macam kalau nak cakap pasal sexual cases like harassment kat singapore the government just like turns a blind eye towards it like why is the system so whack
I've never seen a muslim like righteous of para muslim say that like alah but then like maki alah also like did you see the french people right that was like
ya the thing is like cause french they are trying to reach like circularism macam dia tak nak apa-apa religion at all kat dalam dia orang country or tak nak individualism kat dalam country dia orang also dia orang tak nak ah tudung semua tak nak which I don't understand because other people from other religion macam nuns tu semua
because they tutup also right I'm not saying they shouldn't also I'm saying like why the double standards macam kita orang tak boleh dia orang boleh and then the french the macaron you know the french cookie the president ya dia kata dia tak suka hijab cause we look scary
but then like as much as we understand do you see the thing with us is right I'm not saying like I'm not saying we are greater than them but like muslims we endured so much and like we've been we are the most oppressed religion but we understand and respect the fact that they cannot understand our religion but they cannot give us an ounce of respect that just infuriates me a lot lah macam aku boleh err macam hormat kau punya agama asal kau tak boleh hormat kau tak faham pun the very least you can do is just give us respect
they don't even no the thing is that they are so ignorant dia orang tak kesah but the thing is even if you tak kesah or like don't care just leave us alone there's no need oh really but the thing is they don't care I think is not they don't care they just hate us for some god damn reason I don't understand why
ya I think cause of our agama also cause you know nabi muhammad he say cannot hate anybody and you respect I think a lot agama and morales also I just don't understand why why do they hate us but
singapore is so sheltered honestly seeing as to what is happening in like all over the world kita dalam bubble and like do you see how many people are like I'm not saying they are dumb but I think we are like so selesa and comfortable dalam singapore then when you like tak kesah
I'm not saying you but like you know some malays like they say the N word and apa lagi like just perangai dia orang ah I'm wanna believe is adolescence but macam bodoh apa like kalau kau tengok balik they end up what the fuck I'm not supposed to say that
like what was I doing back then you know I don't know the new generation of mak minah scares me ya scare me like dulu dulu is not this bad like honestly in my opinion like right now even though last time got gang fight or what is like never serious in my opinion ah tapi sekarang macam I see them like throwing maki ah mak kau
mak kau ya is just uncomfortable lah to tengok like the younger generation
is very sedih ya macam kalau cause the thing is um like the older generation tak nak pergi I'm not saying
that we're gonna like you know right when the time comes it comes but then is gonna be our turn to lead and then we kalau kau tengok the younger generation aku macam err like you know just sad to see I'm not saying we are all bad
apa dia buat ni ah
honestly I don't even think you are a minah you just look like a normal malay like ya
ya you see the thing is with a lot of muslims nowadays they fikir just because then they feel macam
judge you and then when they want to say something or like like to say something ah is not even tegur is like sindir like asal kau I'm like um sorry sally like like you know like asal kau pakai tertutup asal kau I'm like um I'm trying my best you know like the way they tegur is it comes off very like offensive maybe it's just us I don't think I don't think I'm that sensitive
some people like please please others just because they want something but then I think like there's a difference between like pleasing someone to jaga hati or pleasing someone to get them to be your friend on games or something like that that's like very different though but sometimes I think people get mixed up about it
like just because I told you this and then you ungkitkan balik I hate it when people do that like when I tell you something and then you just suddenly bring it up again even though I did not mean it in that context macam apa ni bodoh like no like like I would say the younger generation that is cause
I mean the older generation I can tolerate a bit ah a bit sometimes they a bit too proud ah of what they are you don't have to ya they don't have to bring themselves up ya they bring us down to bring themselves up macam dulu aku kecil-kecil how ah I don't know lah
wow congratulations wow masuk jannah esok but I've met some people that dia orang err like hafal al quran all that until like not say fluent or what I'm not sure that's what they are trying to do but it comes off that way or maybe I tersinggung sikit sebab I tak boleh hafal but like you know there's no need to
I come after you eh aku baru habis khatam tau kau tukar ke tak kau kat masjid mana macam like wow and usually is like not saying what ah but is the madrasah kids pun macam gitu ya and then they
eh I don't know cakap bahasa arab aku macam okay thanks oh my god ya oh my god ya is it like sometimes aku like just fikir and talk about these stuffs
like deep down I will ask myself is it caused by cemburu or what but honestly honestly I no you know
but like macam it just like sakit hati the way they talk to us is like that
then then like you don't like skip the drills and then you continue like then you khatam like you know there's some people that go to some extend in order to macam rasa bagus sebab dia yang not even about quran or what like just in life general macam
dia lari empat round you you baru lari dua round then you just say oh I finished eight rounds macam gitu you know like the competitiveness and like ya I think is like
how you act on it also apa dia buat pasal tu dia dia yang vlogging vlogging tu kan okay
I only have one girl friend that ada lesen motor and she bawa scooter ya comel bodoh and is very is the lah like I think morgan I'm not very familiar with motor but I think what is that ah
okay sorry I didn't know it's comel at least you will come to school and like like that but I think like hujan a bit difficult though ya mm ya but how hard like how I have friends who have like motor the besar one just like five K starting price
wow dah fikir jauh sister
mm ah inshallah actually study like last month you know COVID COVID the thirty five guest should have went for it lagi murah really I have like some friends and cousins actually only a friend and two cousins
kahwin during so they only invite dua puluh lima orang then the others like online it was like cheap not cheap ah but like compared to what the malays you know malay weddings are so expensive sis you dah save you wanted to get married twenty two
kalau ada jodoh then it will happen
but wow I'm betul-betul cannot believe that you like dah plan I'm like wow cause like bila cakap online like you're eighteen I'm like cool she's still a student too I'm like she's still around that eighteen age wow
wait you ambil berapa course kat mana how much is it ah I heard private course like expensive what did you sit for like apa you belajar
same same industry also um how you cari course like this oh
but I think like your course and dia punya timing betul-betul chun like cause of the pandemic betul-betul cari like orang apa ni like healthcare people ya they cari ya ya so that was the timing was nice but the pandemic no lah
tak nak try hospital like oh okay okay
oh that's a bit leceh
untuk kahwin okay okay sorry sorry
is he oh no not reservist right oh okay okay sorry sorry I mean how old is your that one oh okay okay kat tekong
yeah oh okay is that a lot I have friends that habis satu kotak like one kotak per day like how what the fuck oh wow isn't it like mahal because I have friends also they pokgai pun masih nak beli rokok
ya then kalau tak pinjam I don't understand the
pinjaming the satu batang satu batang thing it's so funny like halfway through class satu batang K minggu depan okay
cause like my family is don't smoke like my parents tak smoke langsung then when I masuk poly then I'm like to me culture shock cause um none of my friends like close friends smoke but poly oh my god everybody whenever you turn somebody is smoking and like
wow aku macam quite shock nampak dia orang as kelakar to me but like to them is a norm but dah biasa is so cute like minggu depan aku bagi kau balik like wow
comel that's legit selling seh I never see the photo legit wow smart smart no ah no lah
oh my god then they tell the anak-anak look down look down lower your gaze tutup mata scary seh oh man ya
I know some girl friends will be like chill sister I do not want your mat tahir
anak siapa tu astaga
same like like rilek-rilek ya ya macam sendu ours apa sia minah-minah ni
then like they refunded to me aku malas nak register balik and then now online registration got registration fee like online fee I think it's like three dollars or four dollars aku macam I don't want lah I gemar cara
but private mahal ya motorbike but actually I learn how to I don't think is illegal cause my family has like houses like in indonesia then we also have family there then sometimes we just ride the motor there like they teach us lah so technically
I can bawa already I mean if you is this going to be used against me but in singapore I have friends who takde lesen then they just bawa motor they just bawa as long as you tak kena tangkap
I'm not trying to teach you or what but I have friends lah like you know they just bawa takde lesen as long as you tak tangkap is okay takut risky
no but you can beli motor tak lesen
can like my friend no err family member that can pay you see my friend um jual his motor to this kid he haven't even get his license
then he dah dah letak nama dia bayar dah dah ambil dah budak tu I don't know if he has his license already lah but at first when he beli takde I don't know how he gonna learn also cause of like circuit breaker last time but at least he is learning now
but ya but don't lah don't it's illegal illegal don't do illegal things you smoke like cold or hot ya I can smell it why honestly bila my friends cakap pasal ni aku tak but they said got the feeling the feeling
they said hot sakit berat berat is it what you say heavier ah
but you know one brand like gudang garam that one like gold mine cause I don't know how my friends got it but they like bawa ke sekolah and then they spread ah ya like I don't know how they supply dapat like that day budak ni bawa tu macam
you know when they jual it then that thing you know then dia kasi kasi orang I don't know if they beli or what ah but I'm just like very curious macam mana korang dapat ni semua especially when they are underage and then beli
I mean eh that's a huge flex eh you want to like minum bandung I want to drink bandung in bandung like wow I mean if
you had the money like takde feeling there ah makan french fries kat singapore
you want like just keep quiet right and then tiba-tiba segan takutkan dia orang why is it quiet ah
kelakar bodoh aku tiba-tiba like ah budak ni tak nak kasi duit mm mm inshallah
kasi surprised kasi us another surprise
tapi feel like banyak though on the other side apa sia budak-budak ni
I mean who doesn't duit tu siapa tak nak though
podcast though like in singapore is very like the podcast that are available in singapore is very niche semua nak buat like orang cina-cina you know like the youtubers siapa ni I don't watch them but I think they have podcast and is so like damn I feel lah in singapore when I look at podcast I have never seen or I haven't come across
broadcast melayu like in english but then by malay people
like not about religion because most of the podcast I see if it's singaporean right there's like religion aspect to it maybe if you want to start then you start ah then you have that you occupy that spot but I don't know err malay podcast usually talk about agama like a lot of it
I pusing so no lah eh I only ever seen like those ya but that one is like tiga puluh sen like you can buy it at the convenient store ya ya ya that one you pass around your friends
lighter kau ada lighter tak lighter aku dah habis ya that's the thing I hear a lot also
no like again with the race I'm not trying to pull the race card all the time when I'm talking but like I don't know I just tak nampak banyak orang melayu yang mungkin aku tak baca berita harian ke apa tapi I feel like all the
newspaper propaganda so I don't even bother looking at it but aku tak dengar banyak macam success story for melayu that's like wow you know
mm I think the latest entrepreneurial I heard about is like this chinese couple they start like a pet grooming service ya untuk anjing ah I mean that's for them ah that's a niche for them but like aku tak dengar pasal melayu pun asal kita punya community diam jer
kan kan aku rasa dia orang dengar macam bosan though
no I think like when we send it to them then dia orang akan dengar and I think cause cause the video they show dalam form like changing changing the code switching that one I think they akan belajar to like analyse the way we cakap
interesting ah macam I think this is something only bilingual people do I mean no shit lah how can one person with only one language do it what you know but then I've never heard of a chinese person speak in chinese in mandarin and english like campur is usually one one like ya around me lah is like very rare and like
most of my chinese friends don't even speak mandarin cause they hate mandarin I don't know why ya some of them hate the bahasa ibunda I'm like bro
ya betul betul
aunties or what will come up to me and ask me how to get to a place in mandarin K like I understand a bit only but after that aku tak faham kau nak aku buat apa I get so like at first confused but then like cause before I wore hijab
I I look like a chinese like ya I don't like it cause one time I got offered bak kwa before I'm like 我是马来人:wo shi ma lai ren no bak kwa for me no oink oink for me sweetie
but like the err chinese aunties they will like literally like look at you for you to stand up ya ya then I'm like I'm like no no especially if kalau tu bukan apa ni reserve seat why the why should I ya you know is not entitlement right ya of course

okay so basically it's macam uh it's a video where I go to places that's really cheap and at the same time it's affordable for students like students themselves
tapi the thing is and one of the things that I researched on was longkang fishing and longkang fishing was very I feel it's cheap tapi it's tak accessible
longkang fishing

he saw the girl and he saw the girl punya purse dalam tu ada like berjuta-juta cash so being like a poor ass human being he stole his her purse he stole then he tried to walk away from her hotel but then he felt bad then he came back and he wanted to take his notebook

um aku tak gurau ni
mana you need to pandai cari lah you cannot obviously find those yang
apa tu yang what do you call that
you cannot you cannot go to a like a shop itself kalau shop tu ada brand it's definitely going to be expensive you need to buy something yang tak ada brand sebab okay if I tell you um chanel
a bag from chanel or a baju from chanel and a baju from H&M but it's the same exact baju it's the same exact colour however will there be a difference in price
abeh tak nak layan sia aku
wei aku macam nak buatkan rumah untuk coki
and then he like the circle carpet outside if you have saw it and then he also suka bilik mak aku
tahu ah
bilik mak aku a'ah dia dah romantic mood
eh kau ni dah kenapa tengok banyak sangat siao
blackout lah like opaque like eh windows pula astaghfirullahhalazim
ah sebab kau kan vampire
so your house is like just dua tingkat you know you look at my cat
no but then if you open the tingkap near your bilik it wouldn't be a problem right near your room
tapi our air freshener that right there is like an ioniser
tu the white colour thing the ioniser it it basically right it helps you remove all the bad and harmful macam bacterias in the air and then keluarkan the cool air
I cannot understand punya fame you know I realise something weird about me I like like groups that are not famous
he has like wow I know him badan dia like okay it's just something I would like to have you know asal ada benda yang memekak luar kat situ
I'm not saying maisonette is like atas bawah tau rumah dia macam rumah shafiq tu
I mean if you want if you want to have your own house isn't it macam you want your own space
why oh because you just live in your room eh sekarang dah terbiasa gitu lah oh okay okay faham faham
so ah rumah aku ni sebenarnya banyak buku tapi buku-buku ni semua dia untuk perhiasan aku tak baca pun
uh huh atuk aku ada kasih aku buku bila aku P three
cerita dia pasal kampung girl a'ah dia sebenarnya nak kena kahwin dengan siapa lah aku tak tahu
and then it got really complicated aku tak pernah habis baca sebab I find the character so cringey
and it's like macam about love and I'm like awkward reading a love story
but aku rasa kalau aku kasih ulfa she would like it I guess
ah about apa don't get me you know I feel like she has very high standards
macam even the like okay so that day I ask her like
what ah to jaga her atuk and nenek and then she said that her mother is currently working for jems I don't know but I think got out something
like that time ada thing but then in the end she managed to go also pe
ya lah ngok
serious ah asal
ah selalu gitu oh my god girl you want me to get started on christina and ulfa eh no salah nama christina and insha
so what happened is that they are keys team both are them ada boyfriend kan however the thing with insha is that she's for always with her boyfriend like twenty four hours with her boyfriend
so it's so weird sebab macam it goes to the extent that the netball cage key the cage key that the captain have to hold is with her boyfriend
and like macam okay so you're not do you follow them on instagram okay but anyway but if you do then they actually like macam you know how like friends and celebrity couple sometimes they get in a bad condition or situation they always like put up this act or show that's what okay insha did to christina so on like
she she said that macam kalau in terms of apa
and then I was like are you guys best friend I texted christina tapi ya that's not how it is
dan dan hari tu dia orang keluar together they did a double date lepas tu azhari didn't have money like I don't know I don't know why azhari didn't pay for it but then akif paid for it like christina punya boyfriend he paid for insha punya cable car ride

like in that one stream because kirakan everyone dapat lepas geram ah that kind of thing so finally can get to give him money and people will send him like five hundred dollars at the time I was like damn these people got money I also want sia I haven't sent my first super chat but I want to send to someone I'm planning to do it when someone is doing then I can be like thank you for your service thank you very much
this girl also she she debuted like I think a month back her avatar is very cute she's like a shark girl she's super cute with the tail and all that she debuted like less than two months ago then she already hit like a million subscribers everyone was just throwing money at her it's insane dude and these people never even don't even need to show their face they just sit there act cute on camera play game tu jer easy game dapat duit
so everybody was like okay just wait until the next character banner comes up which I think will be zhong li that's why tu aku pun nak sia he's so hot I cannot I really cannot
uh oh then yesterday I was watching another one of his streams it was it was the funniest like games stream that I've ever watched because so there's this girl her name is chihiro yuki but basically she's her main character is like uh this magic girl and then but sometimes she she uses like a deeper voice kirakan macam jadi lelaki lah that kind of thing so uh then she was streaming Apex with that voice and then suddenly these two guys two of her friends join in then they like want to play along then dorang pun buat suara merepek gitu then they were like oh I want to do this then they were like shit they were saying it in the in the like manly voice and then suddenly they go back oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that it's damn funny but if they stream didn't last for that long long lah but
tapi I faham that situation that was me when I was playing when I started playing zelda I was like so kecoh you know I'm like aku macam budak bodoh sia aku aku nak nak simpan dia nya apa tu I wanted to like stop I would accidentally press the arrow button like to to aim the bow and arrow then after that bila aku nak aku nak cancel kan aku lupa nak cancel then instead I press the left side dia nya down button and then that's how you activate the whistle right then after that instead I start attracting all the monsters in the middle of the night macam budak bodoh sia I died so many times while playing that
lagipun you main you like now you play is it PUBG or is it COD
the theory of relativity for fun like this guy then I remembered the one thing I used to play a lot I had the Wii Fit then aku just duduk itu dengan apa tu dia nya itu like the the white punya platform itu then I look at the thing then I'm like eh aku berat ah sia then after that I was like okay whatever moving on but that was quite fun then but I did have the
uh I don't know ah I don't remember her name but I went to her house cause my mak nak pergi masjid so she had to drop me off there ah then she was then oh my cousin like she was playing Mortal Kombat on the then you know at the ripe at the really young age of four then like she was playing it and I saw it and I saw someone's spine get ripped out of their body and then um ya it kinda traumatised me I couldn't sleep that night cause I was always looking at the door I was scared that someone would come in and then rip my spine out ya so that's
oh serious ah dia orang belum like you beli kat mana Shopee
I think you try dahulu kalau dia orang tak reply baru send email
serious masih belum
it's kat Carousell or what
BTOB huh BTOB can they okay to be fair I guess half of the band half of the band is still in the army but the first thing I think I showed you right the first thing like changsub and eunkwang just got like uh they just got released right recently then the first thing they do is go act stupid or some national television show where some matching gold and silver outfit with the X on bodoh it's like if I don't know if you know but they did something similar like a long time ago
it's it's like those body tight suits then changsub pakai yang gold then eunkwang pakai yang silver or some or it was the other way around it was like skin tight you know it's the kind cuma muka dia orang jer boleh nampak and then they go on national television you know and then they go sing some stupid trot song then they come out of the army okay lah admittedly now is a bit more classy dia orang pakai macam like black they like the black business pants black business shirt that kind but doesn't take away from the fact that they are doing something so bodoh but okay lah I miss them I'm glad they're back those two are probably my favourite members
so now I'm but I'm so I'm glad that in wait in the army got to rest I'm glad that he he and key got to enlist together that one was damn funny the video with the band members dia orang tengah buat hal kat belakang tu kan tu merepek sia but at least at least it's good to see that they're having fun in this
tapi dia orang punya army macam best jer
like the concert I remember eunkwang was inside one like dia orang masuk army buat ke pe ke dia orang tengah buat some musical school or what sia I don't get it dia orang ada military band lah buat performance sini performance sana dia orang buat parade abeh tu kita kat singapura dia orang macam nak mati sia
I feel like april some should have gotten though I was talking to my secondary school friend the other day then then his was he had to enlist in april tapi dia dah dapat
I'm aku aku pun tak tahu sia I have one friend who cause dorang ada I cannot I don't
he got an offer to join like dia orangnya commando training or something like that it's like macam
I feel like elite is too is too strong of a word but macam lebih dia orangnya fitness level is a bit higher than the rest
seram sia then he then they said that oh they will learn
kirakan body of the army isn't it or is that weapons infantry
tak kan
ah I remember I remember the whole fiasco everybody was like oh my god what happens if they need to enlist like guys chill it's their it's the law they need this is bigger than you guys weh tapi seram seh the fact that they have to draw lots I feel like that's scarier I rather just everyone enlist like that
there has to be a better way to do it rather than drawing lots it really felt like oh dia orang dah tak boleh kesah korang nak macam mana nak buat macam ini ah tak pe lah aku tak kesah ah pick lots jer lah gitu jer
gitu jer really that's the gitu jer the effort
but it's seram sia
ah itu itu itu itu itu that was probably the most war like thing I've watched but
and it's budak kecil lagi
the part when dia apa itu dia kasi batu eh batu then dia ingat it's gula or something like that
my nenek was I remember she I cannot remember if she told me the story or my mum told me the story
dia orang tengah I think they were like searching the houses or something like that then
dia nya mak bapa they put her and her siblings
rice sack then letak kat dalam drain then two of them the siblings they put they hide the siblings inside the rice sack cause dia orang masih kecil kan then dia orang letak kat dalam drain dia orang cover then after that they ran away I don't know what happened after that I didn't really ask I kinda wanna know but I don't really want to ask cause
lagipun masih kecil sia it's
dia orang naik sampan serious
you'd be budak indonesia now wow
it's the one that resulted in yang dia orangnya nuclear meltdown kan is it
cacat isn't the right word because it looks very pretty but it seems like it's all deformed and like
correct correct it's like what you see in like sci-fi movies gitu seram siot I wonder if they rebuilt it
merepek sia this guy
but I do but I guess that's the one thing about japan ah dia orang they're very secular
new zealand aku pakai hijab kan then bila kita masuk okay lah granted this was quite a long time ago
kita me and my mum my dad cause me and my mum dua-dua pakai tudung kan kita masuk cafe dia orang tengok kita macam kat zoo sia dia orang macam
like bro chill I'm ten like don't okay I wasn't ten but like like like don't need to stare so hard you know but then when bila kita kita pergi japan all that they were much more polite about it even if they didn't like it they didn't say it outright
belongings anymore you can't retrieve like old photo books so it's kind of like everything your whole life just got washed away like that ya and at that time I think a lot people at the beach also so ya lah it was quite suay that it happened and I don't think it just affected aceh it affected some parts of malaysia also ya ya then kat situ pun ada macam satu family dia orang pun dia orang tengah main-main kat beach then dia nya anak pergi lari near the coastline ya then
seram pe
that's true ya the pros are pretty big considering that we have like protection from natural disasters singapore like singapore is a pretty safe country I would say like the fact that I can leave the house with the windows open and come back with everything still intact I think that's pretty impressive within itself like I saw the news dia orang kan like ada orang malaysia tinggal kat singapura since the borders dah tutup kan
limited is it like orang like pekerja so like I think either they went back or the police found out or the neighbours ke pe he found and he had the house they had the house had been broken into then apparently the thieves the
right it's so gross kan like can you imagine you come you cannot go back to your own country because of COVID and after that when you go back all your stuff dah hilang then ada orang tidur kat dalam katil kau ee seram sia I cannot it's gross it's so gross
for all the homeless people in like los angeles or that part of los angeles cause itself is besar gila kan there's only two doctors who are offering who will go around giving out free healthcare free check ups for these people like can you imagine the first the the fact that firstly there's so many homeless people is already like so telling of korangya government but then the fact that so many doctors like come on obviously there has to be a lot of doctors right in america the fact that only that cuma orang dua orang jer are willing to give out free treatment for these homeless people like they seriously what do you lose from it you know like where's your basic sense of humanity if you've got you've got the knowledge and skills korang just check up sikit pun boleh pe the fact that only two people regularly do it
it's so insane I cannot stand america dia orang nak vote pun buat hal
it's gross sia then now also I just really hope really really really I pray to god ya allah please forgive me for all my sins just just make sure donald trump tak menang serious I if people if
people are still dia orang nak tulis apa tu cause you can write in to you can even if your candidate name is not there right you can write in the name of someone which is a bit bodoh ah honestly like what's the point a lot of people dia orang tulis nama kanye west tau because he was he's been joking about it no it to us he feels like he's joking but to him it's like he's it's real right he's been talking about oh vote me in for president president guys then I'm like
asal kau nak buat macam ini ya allah serious why it's so bodoh I cannot and the fact that
it's like I was a bit scared because jangan vote opposition for the sake of voting opposition like you kena tengok pandai-pandai lah look at the zone if it's versus what
reform party or something the the group that nampak macam gangster mat mat on the street macam mat biker ke pe macam at like
if they can't even give a proper speech if they can't even sound motivated on national television you think they can take care of your zone and all like pandai-pandai ah don't vote anyhow for the reform party lah
like I get that it's good to have opposition but pandai-pandai ah don't
I have to admit though cause dahulu I tinggal kat serangoon kan I used to stay under worker's party area yang hougang serangoon aljunied itu I have to admit a lot of things were broken a lot of things weren't fixed properly that kind of thing but I guess you're right lah ya dia orangnya financial backing
but that's the part that I don't get kalau they're dia orang dah kat dalam government
abeh itu then they want to upgrade the resident's like area
ugh so sad I really cannot I'm I'm never gonna get over it aku serious nak pergi overseas
that's why sia the moment we were like waiting for the news is the border going to be closed or not but then bila kata tutup then we were like ah shit
it's only end of week one there's so much stuff to do already and I don't know what's going on I feel aku masih belum tengok election video takpe takpe whatever selama aku dapat mark attendance it's okay takde exam pun tak yah kesah
but did you know now that I think about it right at first I was like very sure that I wanted to do magazine but then now that we're actually during production production macam
hmm like not bad seems quite fun also but I guess we have to wait until we actually see what it's like bila the test ah I'm just scared
bro you can't even masuk malaysia
buka the border
but when did it even tutup the borders is it recent no eh
but I also scared to masuk malaysia now though like now malaysia tiba-tiba banyak gila case
ya bro like in a day dorang ada macam three hundred cases tau
but it's like macam at area but still like like it's COVID man it's like the virus dia boleh spread cepat-cepat pe no matter where you are
I know like a a week ago or two weeks ago it was like oh uh one case dekat like uh what macam punya yang macam apa sunway lagoon I don't know then tiba-tiba two case seh tiba-tiba like twenty lah blah blah then tiba-tiba in a day like one hundred or two hundred I don't know something like that
basically like spike up like the cases spike up in a day banyak gila
for real so I'm kinda okay that kita tak boleh masuk but the thing is for the past few months it was close like macam asal kita tak boleh masuk tapi ni dia dah spike up balik so I don't know
dorang dah start balik apa dorang punya I don't know like dorang dah start they have to start like staying at home again
I mean I was I was stalking like malaysian punya celebrity then dorang macam yay lagi then I'm like oh really for real that was like four days ago two days ago ada orang post gambar I don't know
I know crazy right bro I literally just only thought like it was a getting better then like tiba-tiba spike up balik
first like okay like alhamdulilah ah like I finger crossed it won't happen to singapore like even though yang korea dapat apa the second wave tapi it's not as much as malaysia tau
ya but it like the cases are not like super macam uh as macam extra like macam banyak gila
ya mana ada time nak
nak stalk syafiq kyle
even though I tak suka pun I akan tengok seh super bored
no I just know that eh I only watch if I know the pelakon or if I like dia berlakon
did you even know there's like dramas like halted dia punya then I was ah before this I also like quarantine different time kat saudi kan so I was also keeping up to this malay drama dia I think episode thirteen pasal because of COVID dorang tak boleh film so nearly the drama is been like three months or four months it's like stuck at episode thirteen I think so I don't know how they gonna continue back or what
oh my god but aku pun before this I don't even like to watch K drama like I just I watch malay drama lah K drama malas gila so damn long
no but it's so annoying is like ah no but I only watch it if it's like if I like the main actor together macam
iya lah ya lah I know but like I just I cannot no but that one I watch one I watch so far the one that I watch so far is okay to not be okay that one I like and then the other one uh was when this dude ada breast cancer or something uh ya breast cancer ah
ya cerita lama
um apa like what cerita
that's why I cakap I tak suka tengok K drama cause it's so draggy
six times I swear every time she macam ah I don't know what to watch goblin then I'm like bro are you in this month in this like in this year because of COVID it because kita tak boleh keluar right and cannot do anything right I literally watch the watch goblin three or four times I'm not kidding
ya wait especially if it's like if it's like a korean drama like or like anime ke or a cartoon macam disney you know those kind of thing oh my god like macam fictional punya movies you know people write like fan fiction over them
for real for real I like macam one hour so attached to freaking marvel punya ah like you know because of like I was so attached to that because like whenever ah bila apa uh uh ironman died right so I was like damn I need closure I seriously need to like closure so I read a fan fiction on like how like after tony died like dia punya macam fake anak macam you know work to spiderman lah other than that like than I was like wah
that makes me macam happy already
I don't know but like as as for me if I'm like so into something right especially like macam marvel like after ni before I masuk uh I watch end game aku tengok like the whole movie sequence before that
then aku baca just to make myself feel like happier
why boring it literally gives me so much like pleasure and like macam warmth and comfort knowing that macam whatever at least spiderman ada girlfriend even though it's fake and it's not like real but like you know whatever
like I mean like even K dramas I saw like macam they did like alternate these stories of like that story
I mean the purpose tak semestinya untuk for that but macam mostly people macam when you like something so much like you crave for more what macam if you kau pernah tengok spiderman kan
you know how spiderman uh uh spiderman before this is like spiderman when gwen right macam peter parker and gwen right like ya but the one with tom holland sekarang ni is like peter parker and but tak banyak movie of peter parker and what so people make fan fiction of it then kita macam oh my god imagine ah so happy
ya it's okay tapi aku baca fan fiction just like just to make myself happy lah you know satisfy myself even though it's like not true not real but like it's okay
like what korean dramas kau tengok
how about is it that intrigued macam like
tak pernah like tak classy
like everytime hor I want I compare like malay dramas and korean dramas I mean since I am malay so obviously I would compare what like really like I don't know maybe it like speaks for the way like koreans dress in general they so aesthetic so macam
no but general in general like if you want to buat like if you want to macam buat the drama tau like K drama they very they like go out from like they very they like they they there's no boundaries like you know how like hotel kau pernah tengok hotel del luna right
like bro imagine that but in a malay drama I don't think so I don't think you can do that because you know why because in malay dramas there's like limits and boundaries that you cannot pasal religion that's why
ya cameo then he datang right
oh my god I remember aku tak think of that sia
at the end okay lah it's okay but kalau K dramas usually kalau cameo dia datang just to for fun like just there to like for that one episode one episode jer
and also I've never heard of like macam korean drama buat second season
for real abeh maybe sebab dia macam hospital hospital
of course [lah]
now like it's way even at like this malay station ah some tiga atau sembilan they they showing hotel del luna now you know
oh my god oh my god park seo joon dekat suria
bukan eh I don't know
like dub macam orang lain cakap take over orang melayu is talking like they speaking in melayu
no but dulu-dulu when my nenek watch cerita like macam apa uh you know the channel one
so it's a korean singapore punya channel but dia cuma apa tunjuk like korean show like they dub you in malay so weird
tak suka seh it's so it's so
like so uncomfortable I don't know I don't like watching dub one even anime macam english hmm weird
but ya eww weird nya
like audio original I mean I mean that's why they like like over the time like I don't understand when like people especially in the western areas who cannot watch movies that are not in english like you what if you cannot watch any uh subtitle uh the subtitle at the same time like hello it's not that hard macam buat jer lah like
like do you know like this there's this one time this I don't know this what this person daripada this uh are actor ke apa entah dia macam oh ya no no not even actor I think they were in general like kau tahu parasite menang uh a few awards kan dekat america
so like uh I think even the the actors there or like you know a few known people there and the people yang selalu macam dorang tak happy tau sebab a korean movie won like an a prestigious award
ya and then people pun macam but why though pastu dorang macam cakap lah like like it's not in english like how you watch a movie if it's not in english how you understand and then like bro you guys are dumb or what like you can really watch and read the subtitles at the same time but I mean because you guys are so used to only your own like only english which is so sad like
even I tengok even I I tengok malay drama I pakai english subtitle tau
like even though I understand what droang cakap I still put english subtitles because I'm so used to seeing like subtitle and the video itself
aku tak aku tak kan masuk tau aku kena dia aku kena tengok cakap apa
right I can I watched I I I scared I can see both you know I don't know how to explain is not I see both it's just like I can like if I hold my phone I just like tengok I can see both like I don't know how to explain but like I see both
tak ada ah sebab kadang-kadang okay because ada korean drama for me ah ada korean drama kan I don't know about you ah but from what I see right korean drama kan dorang ada banyak kalau you use the subtitle ah translation kan dorang banyak guna bombastic word tau
ya big word so I was like sometimes I take a few I take a few quite a long time to process tau apa yang dia tengah cakap ni tau
that's why I was like that's why that's why it took me quite awhile that's why I because that's because of that I have to like macam read it slowly ya so that's why macam kadang-kadang termiss apa dia cakap ya so I was like thinking are they actually memang
ya bombastic words atau dorang actually because of the translation then dorang guna big words
but I was like thinking macam if you watch malay drama english drama like I don't think they use very big big words
huh really macam apa seh
singapore punya oh my god malay drama tak boleh sia
paling tak aku tengok anak anak metropolitan that was long ago but I never even keep up I just
I didn't really understand the story I just know that they are like really like macam kids who like have problems that's all
anak metropolitan singapore
after that after that macam dia punya tu what
ya I don't understand seh how to use semua tak tahu
then tak boleh
huh you didn't even masuk like this year or like last year
ya I went like masuk oh my god last year I masuk banyak kali seh pakai pakai train
it was so fast no at first I was so sketchy tau aku macam oh my god mesti like lama mesti like boring and like tired tiring it wasn't even that long cepat gila five minutes jer
for real really the immigration was so fast but I don't know but I went during like macam the june holiday
five minutes I'm not kidding five minutes for my mum I I went many times right so the first time I macam I didn't count but apa but the orang cakap macam five minutes so the next time I came my aunt really taruk timer it was like four minutes and like uh fifty seconds four three ya she really put timer you know
tak tahu it was last year
but kalau woodlands shouldn't like it be like the water wasn't around the water area I don't know but I in the train but you know there's a train from singapore to right
ya it's so fast gila like that time aku pergi um dia ingat puasa lagi pergi situ pastu uh tidur kat sana tau okay pastu the next time I pergi I pergi pastu burger dekat uh pastu balik rumah balik like I didn't sleep at I only went back home because it was that fast
it doesn't even feel like five minutes it's like I was just sitting there nanti macam dah okay
cepat gila kan
even when I took the plane uh they say when I balik right from to singapore it wasn't even thirty minutes you know
but usually how long is it from from singapore to because aku tak pernah you I how many times have you been to I feel like I'm the only person yang tak pernah pergi
but it's not like macam okay ah this this this december holidays let's go like you and whenever you go to kau pergi sebab ada family business but then you macam okay we can also chill at the same time is that what you mean
seremban kat mana
I never been there dude the only time I go malaysia is eh I only go to pun macam satu dua kali
from there from um you from but you went there you drove or you naik train
huh what apa kau I don't get it you say thailand now you say england
the atas atas sekali
oh my god that's why I heard this person from singapore dengan kawan dia like naik the motor pergi mana entah like wait
the driver okay will like damn I mean it's easy if you naik motor ah but then it's so cool to do that oh my god
I mean but but it doesn't I think people usually who go backpacking they they are going it for like the view mostly that's why they don't mind macam hotel like cheap ke apa ke at least as long as they get the view
pastu gi walk you walk from one country to another
I don't know some people do that you know okay some people do that but I swear people who do that gila I cannot seh
like that like that that uh I don't know for you know dekat malaysia this um this orang dia jalan daripada to like ipoh or something just to just so that they can see their punya anak cause of COVID
ya I heard something like that like the father literally walked from one state to another just to just so that they can see the anak
just the just the thought of it macam you think tak [leh]
okay lah I mean kau nak jalan buat apa ye you can take the bus you know you're not in the dire situation to walk
mak I
have you no but you know eh uh few recent juga I exercise my mum I go walk from here to jurong east is not as bad as me walking in the reservoir you know I swear walking in the reservoir is way worse I walk from here to jurong east to like JEM to go eat it's not even that bad
I'm not kidding it's really not that bad it's really not that bad bro I literally walk from here to jurong lake garden I really walked with my cousin I walked the whole time daripada this belakang ni I walk sampai jurong lake garden I swear I'm not kidding I that was really a few days after I balik you know
from the bus stop pastu pergi masuk situ eh
go jurong lake garden but then my cousin satu macam let's go then I'm like okay I guess
like aku aku ah aku ingat kita orang akan stop dekat you know the you know there's like a macam park or something behind science garden eh science garden pula science centre
no apparently where where was like aku jalan jauh-jauh that was only five kilometres
ya like half what almost to bila I nak masuk jurong lake garden that was only five kilometres
I was walking I was walking from behind here you know the old block yang dah tak ada
that that's how I follow the route follow the route uh with um ikut pergi science centre
sorry lah baru balik kan I don't know my directions yet pergi JEM pun susah
dude for real oh my god I felt so stupid my mak kan you know how you can tembus from JEM to no no from JEM you can tembus to west gate west gate can go to ng teng fong to
my dumb ass literally my mum suruh I pergi nak cari barang tau but then aku confident dah pergi kat JEM dah beli barang kan pastu you know how there is also another there's also another shortcut from JEM to be big box
I don't know why my stupid my stupid brain went to the shortcut tapi how you know it's close cause the big box also close so I went to I went I saw the sign and it was the the shortcut was closed tau and then I'm like
oh alamak tak boleh jalan shortcut ni then my stupid dumb self literally walk like I really keluar I had to like cross I keluar daripada JEM really cross the road go to
do you understand kau faham tak I was thinking of how that shortcut was going to lead me to even though it's actually big box
I know I I took ah you know actually they close the shortcut then my mum macam huh really dorang tak pernah close pun pastu I was like ya ya ya they close pastu then petang we went again and then we went to westgate then I'm like wait and then my mum is like eh buka apa then I'm like gosh I hate myself
I was so confident I pergi aku jalan and then dia cakap tutup then aku jalan lagi then I'm like okay so it's really close that means I have to like walk like so far away to like from JEM to
I never I never look up you know I just masuk and like
I just need to know my ways see I'm just like not used to going out and that's why actually alone pula tu I'm still getting used to the idea I have to go out alone you know
I've never in my entire life I mean ya I mean okay cause it was saudi so I've never because of saudi I tak boleh keluar like no matter how how old or how young you are like if you are a girl usually cannot leave the house alone
they will get asked by the dajjal
protected it's haram right haram
orang yang not that yang
oh so the the ones yang ada faith and yang ada iman yang kuat they will be they will get protected
oh the real like muslim like one yang betul betul like hold faith
you will be strong enough you akan react out which way because you can never picture yourself on that day itself what
no matter how I I think no matter how macam you you even if you pernah experience pun I feel like if it's at that time truly you can never imagine like how you will react unless you for real for real like you can believe in yourself lah like your faith
ya so macam cool seh and australia kan
is it hiroshima yang ada nuclear
is it when you masuk that macam fake rumah then it
like macam what's like apa yang macam
no but I feel like I feel like if uh aku like hopefully not if aku like if ever if there was ever a time where there was an earthquake aku rasa aku akan panic to the point I will not hide under table I will just and then like suddenly everything fall on my head then like
I feel like no matter how much I prepare for something like maybe if it's not enough like I even if I prepare for it like aku aku tak akan when I panic aku tak kan think straight at all
as long as dia boleh protect your head should be fine lah
I mean dia if you you akan obviously kena squish kena squash by the building but as long as you tak kena uh ni apa fracture your head ke apa ke should be okay that's like the most important part what
ya I feel like macam when like when like uh whenever I see macam yang apa earthquake punya macam what's that word macam dia punya aftermath like you know how they find the people in the building semua
the ones alive their their their okay but maybe their kaki yang stuck kat dia punya macam I don't know like a hard apa benda entah
I mean obviously lah earthquake semua ni it's all in god's hand like it can happen anytime whenever it wants to
this COVID jer I don't expect all this to happen but I guess it's way it is I mean like a couple years back pun ada the spanish flu which was also like
macam a few decades ago I guess
ya but still macam like the way it's like I mean I mean it's a history macam memang tings like this happen like even if it's not common
but it was a big thing in saudi seh in like middle east for real ya I was so surprised aku tak tahu yang SARS is a big thing in middle east
and but I don't think when it happen kat singapore it was like that like wasn't academic also
dorang ada vaccination wasn't there a vaccination for SARS
but it's a like a it's like a like a macam what is it called like a respiratory
but isn't it a respiratory punya virus
like I even when I saw when I heard about SARS about like when I was in school I I didn't know like it was that serious I thought it was just orang sakit tiba-tiba
I didn't know it was actually that serious then now that I'm living through a pandemic which aku still tak boleh brain
we have to do an assignment and it was like oh what what do you what what can you write a macam essay about like how like a diary like a letter to your future self macam like what if feels like to be living in a pandemic or going to a pandemic then I'm like dude I can never imagine like twenty twenty like dear future self I am living through a pandemic like that is so gila like I cannot do you understand like how we're still alive it's so weird tak boleh seh
no but then I'm so impressed with the I was I was so shock when I saw like the news I was so impressed that after three months this was like the twenty seventh obviously lah macam I mean it's death like it's not good no matter how much how much or how little like it's not great but compared to other places I'm so impressed that
it's like it's like serious that you have to go to hospital but not as serious you have to go to a like major hospital gitu
like the one day two day stay that dekat hospital that kind of thing
I tak dengar seh I didn't know that
chey I tak tahu seh I thought that was like a centre research centre or something I was like why this hospital is so damn big
so kau nampak yang hospital
how many rumah dorang nak seh there are so many rumah sekarang kat singapore tak apa pun
but then like they now this now slowly right where like for my situation right now like in saudi they do this like apa saudi I don't know lah basically dorang nak kick out semua foreigners and they want to make the their own people work
that's why my dad suruh I pindah balik kat singapore cause he takut yang kalau dia tiba-tiba kena buang then like I'm in the middle of school then macam tak baik tak tak nice right for me to suddenly like ditch
but I mean alhamdulilah lah maybe rezeki it's better to also
actually dia kerja sana buat apa eh
no no there's this one type I mean I think it depends like sometimes he kerja in the office and then sometimes like there's this banyak kali aku bau dia punya freaking oil like I really hated the smell bro it like petroleum punya smell like it was so in the house and I thought was going to die you know
for real bau dia kuat gila
pakai oil semua kan
bila time kerja
it's not busuk but it's like you think you so chemically eh
like you you bila you smell you macam oh my god I'm gonna die
but that one is like macam refine oil macam dah
got difference it's like raw black oil so maybe pasal tu bau dia macam weird sikit
ya duh that's the thing no the thing is about oh bila bapa aku balik I I can't even see any stain on him you know
you mean so angry at the world or your attendance masalah
eh wait but the thing kan but the thing is kenapa dia nak tanya kita pasal intern bila kita dah habis intern and kita intern sama timing pe and now we schooling again
kenapa eh
is it is it supervisor dia orang lelaki or something like that
plymouth ah K that I heard jadi he can actually do it lah but the thing is the main topic sekarang is kenapa dia selalu awak ah
kenapa bukan saya saya yang single awak yang dah attached pe dia cuma message
tak tapi saya expect
okay saya tak expect apa-apa tapi kenapa dia message awak lebih daripada saya ah I think because awak lebih friendly ke awak lebih friendly looking saya garang sikit
awak kena faham eh badan awak petite biasanya siapa yang petite orang lain akan tengok as macam lebih sopan lebih lembut
percayalah saya saya tahu kita sama height tapi
saya lagi besar awak lagi sempurna okay K let's not talk about this okay tak proper kita boleh tukar topik dia K jadi nak saya bilang apa jadi pada saya dah
K kalau awak notice kan kehidupan saya tetap tenang sahaja
tak banyak complication kerana saya tak berbual sangat dengan orang lain jadi saya tidak ada banyak masalah lagi-lagi
okay ya lah tak kelakar okay jadi lepas tu I
nak message ah cakap thank you terima kasih like I usually do that for every outing like even if kita
I go out with you kan I always say macam thanks for today ke apa semua then
nak message dia nak message dia then suddenly dia nowhere to be seen tak boleh nampak profile picture dia cannot even see his contact profile or whatever
then I ingatkan oh maybe whatsapp glitch ah whatsapp glitch jadi
err tak ah kita dah nampak muka each other kita dah nampak then the thing is
my profile picture were tak catfish ah dia punya profile pic pun sama then the thing is he look so cute why why are the cute guys like this
oh dah okay ya basically every single social media platform and then tak nampak dia lagi and
that time lah eh saya just tahu dia tak suka saya tapi that's okay pasal
dah biasa kan online biasanya dia orang cakap apa ghosts ah ghosts I got ghost stick in my life
tapi tak apa lah ni kehidupan kan manusia what to do it is what it is jadi awak ada calon apa-apa lain tak untuk saya
calon apa ya
ah tapi dia bising lah
tapi tak semestinya dia lagi tua daripada saya dia apa secucuk how do how do you say that in english ah
jauhkan aku dari adik-adik ya that's true
ah okay wait how do you even know him same madrasah or school or
okay faham juga but let me tell you something K my type of guy is like you said soft spoken but can argue with me at the correct times
bantah no no no no bantah is you shake right
kalau saya buat salah macam saya berbual-bual dengan lelaki lain in a
in a macam manja-manja way of course lah mana boleh gitu kita dah ada boyfriend of course kita kena setia kan jadi macam I prefer kalau dia macam
berbual dengan saya eh you are my girlfriend seh eh janganlah buat gitu sebab saya tak akan buat gitu awak tak akan buat gitu kita happy sama-sama
oh my god wait tak
ah apa ah are you serious
ya tapi mind boggling because yang that time somehow ya saya kena roped into the story kan jadi I was also confused lah apa tengah jadi ni then err girlfriend nama dia pun ada mention my name
and the thing is kan all this time dia baik dengan saya tau dia tak pernah tak senyum pada saya dia selalu macam senyum nanti dia hug kalau nampak saya
muka muka dua ular kepala dua err agaknya ah
dengan pelik seh story gitu yang oh lagi satu saya nak bilang ah
bukan bukan nama saya jer yang dalam story itu kawan-kawan lelaki kawan-kawan lelaki tu yang perempuan dia pun letak nama dia orang sana
lelaki itu bukan gay lelaki tu straight cuma lelaki tu
ada juga kawan perempuan takkan tak ada kawan perempuan kan ya jadi yang ex girlfriend ingatkan dia tipu perempuan tu dengan saya tapi
apa mm mungkin dia tak begitu confident dengan dia sendiri ataupun dia punya relationship dengan lelaki tu jadi
saya tak tahu lah saya tak nak cakap apa-apa saya tak nak buka aib dia nanti saya yang kena eh kena jadi saya pun tak cakap apa-apa pasal tu ah saya just diamkan mm
err saya rasa saya tak sepatutnya tanya eh bilang awak tak apa lah nama dia orang semua tapi ni jer lah yang saya boleh bilang awak
yang lelaki tu kawan saya saya saya dah memang tak suka lelaki tu ah
saya cuma ah nampak lelaki tu sebagai kawan baik saya macam abang-abang
tak tak tak dia hanya kawan sahaja dia nampak saya sebagai adik saya nampak dia sebagai abang itu lah kita
punya perhubungan ah kalau faham lah jadi ramai orang pun tahu kita tak suka
a'ah satu sama lain macam kita yes correct we are just platonic friends but a lot of people know that
jadi my supervisor ni melayu you my mentor pula cina lah then kan ni sebelum COVID jadi kita kena buat kerja sama-sama kan jadi saya yang kena pass
uh all these work to let's say kalau dia cakap kena pass err find me to another person kan err jadi I just do that lah tapi nanti
the person I pass it to semua they tell me that it's wrong I'm not supposed to do that then I have to go back you get that feeling
oh okay but the thing is yang the company itself should also update their tablets or their or their desktop or whatever because the thing is we are bound to use it whether at work or what
naik turun bukit you know what let's let's grab this topic completely I want to forget about intern
but most of them still think that we are macam or they have a choice to not choose because I feel like
saya pun confused ah tengok bual-bual pasal apa ni okay tapi tapi saya faham lah saya faham awak kena ah
um okay K saya faham juga melayu kita memang hancur apa yang awak dapat grade untuk secondary ke primary school leh
saya saya dapat B three juga agaknya tapi ah
I do well bilang saya untuk retake kertas tu tapi saya tak bagi pasal uh saya memang tahu saya tak akan ada time untuk belajar untuk bahasa lain atau topic lain
tapi tapi akhirnya tetap fail
awak awak ingat tak yang that time kita tengah
nak cepat-cepat habiskan project sir farhan
then kita tak pergi class kita pergi library
then ah ya ya that one and then uh mister farhan ke miss judy yang pergi library caught all of us dekat sana
ya dia yang tangkap kita semua ah
ya I was there ah saya dekat sana then they nampak saya okay
the thing is kan yang that hari itu tangan sedang berdarah uh
tangan saya berdarah dengan saya tak nak um
lipat saya eh saya tak nak buka sleeves saya jadi ah ku tak nanti baju saya kotor kan kena darah semua
ya jadi saya lipat lah saya punya sleeves then ingat saya cuba potong tangan saya kerana saya sedih ya betul
dia dia ah lepas dia dah marah semua orang dalam library dia panggil saya untuk berbual dengan saya dia dia tanya saya saya okay ke tak lepas tu dengan saya tak tahu kenapa dia
dengan dia punya ketabahan tabah mean apa ya
oh eh okay saya tak tahu perkataan dalam melayu tetapi dia dengan confidencenya dia tanya saya awak sedih kerana awak punya agama tak kasih saya suka perempuan eh tak kasih awak suka perempuan eh
apa lah perempuan ni lepas tu saya cakap tak tak saya saya memang saya saya suka lelaki saya suka saya saya suka perempuan tapi ah ada ada limit dia lah yes
ah lepas tu dia memang paksa paksa bilang ah jer bilang ah jer saya tahu yang awak suka perempuan jadi takpe takpe bilang ah jer saya pun huh

banyak banyak juga ah macam what I have to go through
apa ni hidup aku dengan keluarga aku it's it's been a it's been a ride ah like just life hidup in general ah life in general
love is important ah for me like obviously love love memang
kau tak nak for
semua benda kau benci like it's all it's all based on hate
okay kau imagine
kau imagine kau hidup abeh macam abeh kau uh semua benda kau benci until like kau uh
kau cam kesah kan diri sendiri jer
untuk kau tak untuk kau apa ni worth it ke hidup

I'll call it a dunia yang kejam ni ah like actually like the world is tough ah
world is tough um untuk aku okay kau pun imagine
like takde link ah maybe takde

perbezaan dia ah lain ah as in soalan aku tapi cam tanya jer ah macam kalau kau bayang kan macam kau hidup
ah like everyday apa kau nak jer kau dapat
kau rasa pun worth it tak hidup
asal worth it
tapi kau dapat semua benda kau bayang kan eh kalau
ah tuhan dia tak buka dunia ni
like ibarat abeh buat apa kita percaya dalam syurga neraka kalau kau hari-hari
kalau kau hari-hari semua benda yang kau nak kau dapat kau tak yah work for it
kau tak yah stress about it
kau just cam apa kau nak kau dapat ah so like
it's always been that way sampai kau mati ah tak kan tak kan kau nak hidup
tak kan kau nak hidup gitu like
you like what's apa orang cakap what's the point of ah living
bukan like
ah kalau
kalau kau hidup aku nak obviously like
every everything I mean like if a life has a purpose what and kalau if semua benda yang kau nak then what's the point of living right like uh might but basically you were just saying like
we living in heaven ah dalam syurga sia kira kita rasa syurga ah terus dah tak payah hidup pape like kau pun percaya tuhan pe kan
it's been hard lah it's hard it's been hard to tolerate life ah as it is ah obviously ah I mean like uh saying it for everyone ya tapi rabak opinion kau kau cakap
semua benda kau nak dapat takmo rabak ah
tapi untuk kau kalau macam about like relationship with a girl
apa kau nak like
apa kau nak uh
what apa kau cari dalam
perempuan idaman kau ah
ya so apa apa perempuan idaman kau like
untuk aku I think like
that's uh in general tu apa semua laki pun nak lah
but like uh kau try think think harder think deeper like feel like deeper like apa kau nak apa kau sebenarnya nak
uh dalam wanita like because let's be honest ah like
in life you weren't like kau tak kan kau tak kan dapat perempuan yang sempurna like tak ada orang sempurna pe dalam hidup ni
so kau tak kan dapat orang yang sempurna so like just think deep like kau rasa apa yang those some qualities that
think deeper ah just like what's like let's say lah macam
cam aku okay let berbual pasal aku eh
untuk aku kalau aku perempuan yang aku nak is
someone yang err tak pandang aku macam
dia tengok aku macam lebih daripada lebih daripada orang lain ah macam uh aku nak rasa like I'm like I'm just someone who whose the only one in the world ah like you know
you know kau faham apa aku cakap like

it you know it keeps me alive ah it keeps me laughing I like to laugh you know ah apa ni ketawa semua orang suka ketawa pe
ya so untuk aku perempuan kalau boleh buat aku ketawa that's already
err you know kalau uh in english dia called it like what red flag for one side of the team if
if you get what I mean ah kalau faham ah kau faham tak
so macam
ya like kalau
kalau boleh buat ketawa it's already something ah it's like a lot ah for me
because to me lah perempuan tak perempuan perempuan tak kelakar sangat [ah] like like maybe
yang aku jumpa dorang tak kelakar dorang macam lame ah but I mean I find it cute as well but

aku cam aku cam in denial
I don't know ah for someone else to judge for you to judge or what ah like aku cakap dengan dia cam like
ah asal tiba gini cam takleh berbual ke like
tak kan tiba-tiba nak cakap
ah heartless like tak kan dia tak boleh ingat apa like uh apa kita dah lalui ah like everything
and cam
aku dah cuba ah semua benda sia aku cuba in that in the first one but
slowly I realised cam aku tak boleh buat pape ah and at one point ah I think I was just pestering her too much that I wasn't even pestering ah because actually tu
err hari jadi dia
and then dah gitu aku wish ah
bila aku wish terus ah dia cakap her reply was very
and then uh aku diam ah then aku cam dah gitu takpe then macam then dah gitu aku realised aku check ah then aku check WhatsApp and then just realised dia block aku
on WhatsApp dia block aku on Instagram
err every platform yang kita boleh berbual dia block ah basically
and then aku cam but
the last straw and then so aku cam
aku ambil jer ah aku just angkat jer ah apa yang telan jer ah aku just telan apa yang
dia dah tu kira
the last straw so aku tengok that was the
so I just thought like okay ah I guess aku kena I have to let go ah and
it's over the healing process lama sia
like gentle sia healing process lama sia tu first nya but
you know most of the time it's not going to be ah most of the time kau boleh cakap ah kebanyakkan tak ada orang akan last sampai
kahwin ke jannah from the first one tau
so itu apa aku cakap
siapa tak nak kan semua orang nak lah banyak benda sia semua orang nak like cuma
as I said ah macam tadi like
kalau benda semua semua benda kau dapat dalam dunia pun buat apa hidup pe
tak kan apa beza dia kalau kau tanya yang tiga wishes
cam satu benda jer
apa link sia
pape free uh makanan ah
tapi aku tak nak siapa tak nak free makan aku suka makan siapa pun suka makan
kalau boleh hari-hari Pizza Hut pun Pizza Hut sia hari-hari
muak ah tapi cam
okay but ya anyways walaupun kau berbual tak ada link
takpe aku continue story aku pasal aku nak berbual aku nya story
aku feel bad I feel bad for feeling this way
pasal aku dah dengan
aku feel bad a little bad
aku rasa cam it's a crime
pasal for feeling this because
I already have a girl right now okay kau faham kan
aku cam this girl was like
the ah let's say aku rasa cam second minggu of my school week
so basically this girl was the second my second date ah so cam I saw her
uh at this eating place kat sekolah
kat sekolah ah uh terus dah gitu uh
ini pun tapi ya aku dah nampak dia actually funny story is uh
apa yang kelakar is macam
actually aku
kawan aku lagi dua kau kenal juga ah ah actually tak penting ah cam siapa but like aku lagi dua kita dah macam
uh kita dah macam tiga-tiga dah nampak like ni perempuan
and then kita semua cam nak ah tiga-tiga nak cam don't mind try ah kita just main-main time tu time tu kita main-main tak kesah pasal pape ah
because ah aku pun macam rasa aku heartless afterwards
a bit lah maybe exaggeration but I don't think maybe a bit lah and then so aku cam main-main ah tak kesah siapa nak next siapa nak
try try jer ah main-main ah pape jadi jadi ah
and then so cam
kita tiga ah dah gitu kita tiga buat bet siapa kalah pergi minta Instagram
perempuan ni ah and then ah one of them lost ah so cam dia kena pergi minta
err dah gitu kita dah minta
tiga-tiga ah err in the end tiga-tiga dapat pe Instagram dah gitu err
dorang tak jadi ah dorang tak jadi try
ke apa dorang just
dorang pun ada sendiri sendiri nya somehow dorang pun
so aku cam ya I found this girl
to be oh first aku cam
for a few days aku tahan aku tengok story orang dia semua macam mana
aku tak plan pun actually nak
ah through dia nya social media jer ah as in aku tak tahu ah camne because aku belum berbual
so cam aku tengok jer ah dia nya social media dia macam mana
dia okay
so aku cam oh dia okay jer actually
because like aku found dia punya stories to be entertaining
kau tahu cam Instagram stories dia
uh cam entertaining
abeh cam kelakar kelakar it's really kelakar even for me you know
dah gitu uh
you know uh I was aku tried to aku go ahead ah and then uh aku tried to her ah and then
oh but I thought I was a little heartless maybe exaggerate ah cam
aku dia and then err
to to say ah love at first sight cam
pun exaggeration ah cam lebih ah tapi cam I like her a lot ah
at one point kan I could say bukan cakap not bad ah aku boleh cakap sempurna sia
dia cam dia cam uh ya ni ni ah ni ah this is the one ah this one I thought like oh
so kita continue so we talk we talk we talk berbual berbual berbual
sometimes we misunderstood each other it's okay because uh benda ni semua normal pe
ah so dah gitu takpe ah then
on that day tak salah aku sejuk
nak mampus ah aku cakap dengan kau sejuk nak mampus tak tahu asal it wasn't dia nak hujan dia sebelum hujan and then
aku pun demam so menambah ah sejuk
bertambah sejuk aku cam apa ni time tu tiba-tiba kita berbual ah on that day it was normal tau semua benda normal
kita berbual cam biasa uh
and then tiba-tiba dia cakap err dia ada benda nak bilang aku
then aku cam huh apa dia aku cam tak fikir buruk ah pasal apa yang nak jadi
so terus dia cakap
yang dia dah tak terus aku tanya ah

sama ah sama macam yang first nya macam just tiba
abeh aku macam uh ah what do you mean ah
and then ah dia cakap ah macam

aku cam huh asal seh boleh tiba gitu I thought everything was going good
imperfect ways I saw perfectness ah to me lah I aku nak honest ah like ni I know it's like very
the last relationship I pestered her and then like maybe it's kind of like macam guilt trip sikit ah but
ini I just learnt like okay lah I cannot do anything about it what
itu apa yang penting ah untuk aku like ah apa ni kebahagiaan dia
so kalau dia bahagia aku okay ah
aku cam cakap dengan dia then aku just cakap dengan dia okay ah if that's what you want then I love you enough ah untuk aku I love you I love her enough to let her go ah untuk lepas kan dia
so then aku cam
okay ah apa ni
the day uh apa eh
so aku just cakap ah I just give her a long note I said err all the best in life ah kalau dia perlu kan pape I will still be here you know I'll still be a friend if you want to consider me that you know ah whatever it is know I've always care for you
aku just cam
so aku just accepted how it was and how it is
and aku just wanted her to be happy
talk time and time ah again we don't talk everyday so untuk kau okay tak to be aku tanya kau dulu untuk kau okay tak kalau
kau kawan dengan ex kau
untuk kau okay kalau kau kawan dengan ex kau
okay aku faham ah but
okay so kita jadi kawan ah
and then like time and time I ask about her because I still care about her you know I always care you know to me untuk aku in my own
yang ni apa aku nak cakap ah so like
aku cam okay ah takpe as in I I mean lah I was already accepting it ah as it is I just want her to be happy ah kan ada

ye lah sekarang semua virtual
adoi adoi sorry
you like them ke
what ni macam dalam mimpi kau lah

a'ah macam my my my sleep was like very takde apa bangun macam oh dah tidur macam macam kan selalunya orang ah selalunya orang macam akan cerita pasal dia punya mimpi semua kan but I don't have one like I rarely have one kalau ada pun macam jarang macam tu lah

okay sama
ah ha ye
the one yang macam yang rambut lebat very
oh ye ke
mesti best kan ada baby
dia makan fruits dia very healthy bagus ah
comel lah very cute
wait you talking about cat kan uh aku buka tingkap bilik aku tadi
orh I'm okay ah tapi lately rabak ah because uh apa ni COVID kan so I cannot work so most of the time I stay at home then I just watch Netflix
atau just uh watch new dramas lah basically
correct correct then the one that I regret the most sekarang is uh apa ni the one that you invited me to watch ah demon slayer
for me personally right ah uh aku bukan a fan of apa ni macam cute cute uh type of err art style for the err anime for me I prefer like macam semi realistic so the ones I watch is like initial D but when I watch demon slayer on myself
I regret gila serious because it's like uh the storyline bagus and then like dia punya action scenes also was quite good and then I was really blown away ah so like aw shit I semi regret seriously I should have started earlier cause by the time I started right uh it was
that's why but err but err adding on to yang the older punya animes even initial D pun kan it started in nineteen ninety five it didn't reach that much so like so like the fact that it's brand new then macam it got so much hype and like so much um err attention right it just blows my mind ah ya and I really thought it's it's really nice lah and
not gonna lie ah it's very rare um for this kind of err shows or like this kind of anime to make me cry so got one time too I almost cried cause ah the part yang
err I think is the one yang the second episode yang dia pergi bunuh the very big demon then he touch the head
uh ya the the the one who killed the punya kawan
yes yes yes correct correct then the other one that affected me was um the apa moon that got strip of his uh power pasal dia tak uh eat enough humans the one who use the drums ah
ya uh I felt him cause when he was a human right he wanted to be a writer or something right then tak ada orang appreciate dia so like I can feel because I I also taking english myself so like I felt really
uh terkesan like I was like shocked lah when I cried a bit I was like eh tak pernah pernah macam gini the last time I cried was like err what endgame
kompang kompang gitu
err tapi tapi stress ah yang err dia punya battle tu the other one that err was more stressful was the punya the he was using the spider web or something that was quite scary
sekali a one time slash then mati
that's why tak fair gila serious
ya ya even the intro dia punya what they call it opening I don't know opening ah the opening was also quite macam blood pumping ah for me personally but the one that hit me the most like for me personally eh for you is the music kan for me is the ah story line itself
um uh give them a proper farewell or like a form of respect macam dia tak just bunuh cause oh you're a demon cause err he take the time to like understand them look back ah look through their memories and then like say like eh you used to be human lah so it's not your fault you became a demon so that that part is I think the
I I kind of uh apa ni regret a bit right apart from um not catching up to demon slayer earlier on is that err to be honest but previously I was quite judgemental of anime ah like macam I look macam ah sometimes look at the art style macam very cutesy cutesy dia macam takda substance to it ah but then when I take the time to analyse right actually some animes are good it's not everytime macam those like uh act cute atau macam very cringe cosplay cause let's be honest there there are cringey cosplayers and all that but some of the animes are really damn good so aku macam semi regret so for me personally ah for demon slayer right I started on naruto
um ah I know it's one of the best animes but draggy gila it's too draggy for me but I'm just gonna take the time to like watch ah but waiting for season two demon slayer then like you said you recommend also ah the day before pasal one piece so that one will try so I start naruto first and then one piece but I don't know which one is longer naruto or one piece ah actually
and then ya then but the good thing about anime is like each episode it's twenty minutes lah so it's not too not too macam mundane I guess
ya especially like the those korean dramas ya tapi are these sorry is this the format for err anime like each episode got twenty minutes atau
oh kira macam movie is it
ya the atmosphere won't be there the mood confirm hilang ya
because speaking of this music and setting atmosphere right I think you also got do like music editing right for your game before ya ya in in school cause you're taking ni kan sekarang ah apa ni uh I don't know if the name is still correct is correct me if I'm wrong
ya I see your math semalam jer dah tak boleh tahan that's why I I don't take math
correct correct yang semalam you show me the pasal apa tu row operation that one obviously I try ah but I really I really don't understand lah but the first few question I understand lah ya
ah something like that ya ya but sorry my math tak bagus sangat
because your friends always around you but I will say uni like really force you to be it is either you ah force you to be independent is one thing then like if you really try it yourself tak faham then you have to like uh you know push far and ask around cause if not right you are stuck ya that's what I felt juga
yeah I guess macam uh if like you if you like tanya then like you didn't try then think macam people think that you don't put in the effort that kind of thing then they will start to like have that kind of judgement so like that that that's the that's the dilemma I have also but most of the time I guess it it's our duty to try first and then like really kalau macam we are stuck there right then we just have to ask around if not really gone
ya but the the good thing about uh your course is that uh at least you know some of the people there already like some are before some are for me personally rabak gila ah ah I take english but then like err if even when I try my own right I really cannot do it so like most of the time I ask my lecturers a lot of question in fact I also got ask you some questions about my assignment juga
ya ya cause mak kau cikgu ya ya ya that's why it's it's true ah like I I always thought I had the mindset like boleh buat sendiri boleh buat sendiri just belajar jer just but then like eventually you're stuck then when you realise that you got different opinions right after you try right then at least you ah they call it um crystallisation of your thinking like make your uh ah word flow much more uh smoother ah in a way at least you can understand from different sides
ya eh tak tak I I saw in my study guide apa crystallise your thinking or something like it's not crystallisation uh like um basically they encourage macam um making study groups and all that cause for me like uh like you err yourself ah aku pun introvert that time um when I want to try ask macam malu-malu cause I feel paiseh ah like macam
oh kira macam the vibe is it like you can feel the vibe ah
in a way ah in the same time at the same time from what you explain macam is to juggle the perasaan of the people right ya ya you like you have to be careful cause
um some um I think it's very rare lah that there are people who are very macam clear cut direct cause most of the time people try to jaga hati and try to be more mindful what they say
as very um ruthless or very blunt lah macam later like even though the approach you have are valid I think the person will feel macam very um
ah that's why that's why rasa kecil hati kirakan ya
ah then when they continue doing that then they don't learn kan they don't go then like they keep having that mindset and attitude right then when they grow up right then will like realise asal semua orang keep attacking them ya that's the number one thing that's one thing I had to learn myself cause for me masa dulu I was very sensitive so now I try to macam balance out lah
ya can I share one story ya okay pasal I'm guilty of this so err so err err err the the one thing that err you mentioned about time management there is it for me kan honestly speaking ah
balance and all that so I admit ah sometimes I'm guilty of like not having that time management so I didn't have that much time to study so um before I made the decision to like sit out these two exams right like I uh consulted err my partner and my mother then they said that is fine lah then I think about it macam tak affect my grade cause there was a time before what I failed my exam then my uh drop rabak gila then lepas tu um
I have to rebuild it slowly so I thought about it like um if I can just resit for exam might as well take next semester and just err restudy lah and the good thing ah about my school now is that since COVID right uh they allow us to aid they're going to waive off the resit fee cause by right uh you have to pay the fee tau it's not free resitting the paper I think it's hundred dollars for mine for mine that time but now it's free lah cause of COVID so like I'll just do it lah but even though with these factors in place and I still feel guilty macam I feel so bad macam kirakan I can clear the mod one then macam I'm just dragging but when I think about it I'd rather take this than risk my again uh cause uh the last time I checked if I fail again kan
aku boleh tendang sekolah lah like fully ah I err I think that's the requirement for my school first is academic warning letter then after that is err academic termination then you have to it's as if err after you kena terminated it's as if you have to err re-enrolled lah to the school so that's the downside lah so I'm like ah I don't wanna take the risk ah I don't mind dragging but my still maintain
for one semester is like below two point eight straight away kena that kind of
ah ah that's what I kena ya that's why I'm like very scared now so like my now I'm slowly repairing so like it's in like in the mid twos ah if I'm being honest so like I think about it ah takpe lah just resit ah
I don't want to risk it ya sakit sia hati that time ya
uh are there but how there are different so that um when you speak a certain language right and someone is speaking a certain language they you don't understand each other then like how if you're speaking variety or dialect of it right you you understand so for example english your singapore english and malaysian english right you can understand but if I'm talking english eh I'm if I'm speaking english and kau cakap macam ah there are structures to it that make it different ah I think it's ah sorry if I pronounce wrongly mutual intelligibility or something like ya between languages ah
ya something like that lah like they have a uh a grammar structure specific for that language and a grammar structure specific for this language ya so we just study the differences ah ya so that's why they say we cannot understand different languages ah if like you use uh malay then I use english in like I really don't understand malay you don't understand english then like susah
it's a translation but then like err one word is before the other or one word is after the other so that's the that's the thing and it's very complicated to explain cause like for me when I see the like if you want to really analyse right like you there's a lot of different structures and then like err the placement of the words and all that so that's the difficult part ah ya I think there was once I I look err the one that my prof taught me was err apa ni
professor ya sorry err professor ah eh ah so casual panggil prof uh she talk about english in uh do I call it france or french french french sorry sorry sorry sorry france is the country ya allah eh sorry sorry err so basically um
pejabat office right
ah pejabat pos so it's like it's reverse ah so that's the different thing
ya I don't know cause usually my course is english in psychology but then now they rebrand it ah so is english language and literature so like you have to take a minor in that so like if let's say you take minor english language and literature with communications for example so like so panjang right so like ah tau boleh takpe lah just let it go but I also don't understand why they suddenly uh change it like that like um they just make it english language and literature like um why they don't have the presets cause last time uh when I first enrolled it was english with psychology english sociology something like that ya then like when I saw that um
ya tak comfortable
correct ya cause nanti err it will be natural
for you to start comparing with others tau then nanti macam okay for example you got a posh you nampak orang ni ada Ferrari then you see ah people got um apa Burgundy Burgundy Honda then later you get Burgundy Honda later you got Ducati it never ends tau so like when you keep buying more things like this you think like um err you're making yourself happy cause you are getting everything you want since you are a kid what tapi what you're doing right is you are sort of uh
apa ni putting all your happiness right into this materialistic stuff then eventually it just wear on you
unfortunately he died already ah it's iron man games of thrones tak game of thrones tak that uh one prime uh character in the Marvel uh
uh adding to your part macam uh when you're someone normal and you don't have any powers you eventually uh apa ni
belief and then like ah actually um it's not technically a superpower lah but it's more of like it's err apa tu
keep up that that's the that's the ironic thing eh cause I just realised this now I'm having this uh eh epiphany macam if you notice eh in endgame
uh black widow and iron man tak ada power tau but because of them right they save the entire universe you think about it because black widow sacrifice herself for the soul stone then uh iron man dia uh take the apa tu uh gauntlet from err thanos so like that part was already scaring me cause when he snapped right I thought it they really ah all the efforts for nothing but then like err he managed to get all the infinity stones on his uh hand then he just snap ah so it takes a lot of um courage to do that you know so like it was is is really um mind blowing to think that the two people who saved the universe didn't have that much powers they're just normal human beings with like one has a
ya macam that day jer this is the type of body that you want on the beach oh my goodness
ah dah kurus ya ya
dan cause also um
like it's even more um ah amplified lah I guess lagi lagi malu lah kirakan
tak boleh ah some do play some do play not going to lie tapi um
ya sebab but it's more suited for the mature audience ah
eh tak lari eh topic lari that's why
okay okay takpe takpe go jer
kat mars
dia pergi eh
atau Grab express uh deliver parcel
young ah wah that's a good thing eh like we can remain forever or like we can eliminate any apa tu
ya ya orh then err it'll be relatable to uh demon slayer when uh in the movie uh what's his name eh ah correct me if I'm wrong ah asaka ke akaza akaza he wanted to offer uh rengoku to be a a demon what ya so but he says the beauty of it is that humans die ah so
um if you remain at technically if you get to live forever atau you um remain here forever like you lose the beauty in it uh like if the circle of life doesn't go full circle
but probably why ah sorry I keep relating to demon slayer cause it's quite relatable ah err probably why the apa six demon didn't uh
main balik ah
yang ayam punya rank
hero lama
aku main more to majors tho so
so I'm still embarrass if people ask me for my rank and not to mention aku punya
one of those really premium skin that no one can get and truth to be told aku actually spend
like at least for me kan aku kena baca all the builds dulu tau dengan tengok video semua before aku main
kalau rank
rank siang my chicken rank
where people think like kita semua
player baru but
aku join lah
cause like if you fight from afar then siapa yang nak fight dekat depan tiada orang
oh ya wait I actually I can actually be a tank I remember I would do when kita lolita dengan apa ah
like lolita dengan siapa
um but aku nak try fighter juga ah
ya ya it's the freya it's the fighter and they did dia orang macam revamp freya right but because macam tiada orang like no one really hear nor really plays freya that much so
actually itu aku smash buttons jer bro aku tak tahu apa aku buat kadang-kadang pun aku tak tahu aku tak baca skill pun
aku just smash smash
tak tahu macam mana menang tapi menang lah then like
hmm so the skin pretty lah but the skill not there ah itu itu I think kau main dengan aku punya freya aku think kau pun boleh menang eighteen senang gila
the rank so I think aku just
I also can like ideate do some research on freya sikit jer bukan macam full blast macam aku punya vexana semua yet if you hear my vexana right
menang menang menang all the way and zero deaths bro zero deaths
um tak payah fikir tak payar fikir sangat lah some more vexana is like slow kind
so macam easy target gitu macam macam dia orang walking ducks then kau hunt dengan rifle then it's hunting season lah bro so like
shoot shoot jer tapi aku mage so ya aku shoot shoot gini lembat gila tapi target masih kena
okay I will I will stay stagnant I'm so long I'm having fun I'm flowing I'm good I'm gucci and I will I will rank I also want to challenge myself if it's I always play low rank then easy kill hunting season fun dia macam
merapek it's like one of those weak
majors but kalau kau tahu main then dia lah tapi kalau kau tak tahu main
then ramai orang panggil kau
apa ah jessie is bad which is not good that's why I left the sixty dollars game
aurora is lembab
dia tahu golek golek jer
vexana burns um dia punya target semua tapi like aurora
macam step lawa jer shiny shiny macam dia setakat over then I dengar eh tak nak nanyi let it go
to jer dia tahu
fighter what is this dragon apa ini dragon rider
eh dia jadi dragon ini bukan jadi dragon rider
entah lah apa lah aku tak pernah nampak character itu ini lah what's in the league
I think kalau ada background music untuk aku punya balmond kan nanti bila dia buat yang ulti itu dengar quack
but okay lor balmond aku think
no okay why aku choose balmond kan because when my sister um she just started playing so you have new characters to play
so aku
okay at least kau sedar diri then boleh lah
kau jangan step jadi tank yu zhong ke apa dragon orang semua ingat kau nak dragon up ke dragon tales
dia macam hype sekarang
ah dia orang dia orang revamp hilda and like really give her
so korang semua recall kan this hilda sneaky dia dekat dalam bush and she's just recovering health consistently
kau tahu kau dalam bush kan then you press this one skill later your speed laju
nanti kau zoom dengan hilda dengan dia punya muscle muscle dia
itu yang aku suka macam kau dah terperanjat like kalau ada music background ah nanti dengar
you save one million coin then you get bonus is it mana ada spend ah
simpan pun buat apa ini apa saving account
were to put a real term on hilda it's like all of a sudden kan kau tengah buat kerja
then all of a sudden ada one train railway rail suddenly all of a sudden right a railway underneath appear under your feet then suddenly one train coming towards you then obviously you at the railway how to run right ah semua kan dah ada tempat protector semua
so dah lah habis lah
a working furnace where he just burn like he's burning himself to furnace constant consistently then bila mana dia habis kan then
you burn your health then macam like you the tank so like people already burning down your health then kau imagine kau dah tiada mana then kau pun burn down
dah double edged sword lah itu
lost world itu
where as hilda is like okay retreat then you go to the bush then you work out work out and exercise minum protein semua
but I need to practise hilda I so so scared dia orang pun debuff hilda eh cause it's like legit a lot of players are playing hilda
he's such an undervalued hero being played in low rank then when you go meet ranks suddenly dia orang ban macam tak make sense lah
no lah ah ya it doesn't make sense but besides uranus dia orang ban siapa like basic gusion
oh cause did not admit cause dia orang tak baca dia orang tak tahu baca dia orang suka smash smash button abeh
entah masuk meeting macam mana itu kidding lah
nak buat apa dengan kita punya container tank itu eh
so nak plan macam mana
kita check in abeh tidur
I think I uh I ask him afterwards kita berbual lain lah but then
um okay wait let's go back to the main topic kita staycation
then he was like okay first day mm check in tidur then my kawan like are you serious bro
but okay lor I mean first day check kita can rest dulu lah but then
dia dapat one week tau one week like he don't have to dia tak payah kerja satu minggu seh
kau tau tak the company standard is before like kalau the end of you know before the new year eh new year the same thing lah before the end of the year
like everyone all the all the employees dia orang dapat one week
oh but his one week kan then he tell me so kalau that one week dia tak pergi mana mana
pergi gym everyday lah then aku macam eh
kau tahu tak bila itu hari kita pergi gym kan
dia dah baring dekat bench
dah dia baring abeh dia nak tidur then aku macam fikir kau nak pergi gym hari-hari ke are you okay girl I I don't want to see that happening man
no kita kena pergi
ada along the way oh wait ah there's andes
oh man I forgot where's that tak kan airport eh no we're not grabbing please eh he's already
aku aku nak split pun dia tak kasi
it could be a full court also I don't know why I say andes this is the first thing that pop up I think cause recently pergi airport abeh pergi andes
macam lain sikit ah
tapi aku andes pun bukan punya aku makan ayam aku makan
then after lunch then I think by two then kita
I can blend my nasi gorengnya my nasi gorengnya what is it called apa itu um
rempah you mean
ah yes rempah then like fast game boring lah
or is it too too melampau
nanti you take over cause I might just end up
you gonna spend eighty five dollars on a care bear punya baju okay wait if you want to buy the baju just the baju and then you wear like jeans
why why why would you spend on that care bear baju and then wear outside
with the care bear baju and seluar
weird on him I don't know I imagine spongebob kaki pakai care bear shorts
err okay first day kita check in then lepas check in
eh no no first day lepas dah pack
then lepas dah check in
I think we can save to say kita rest
dinner kita makan luar like around the area just get the feel of
then lepas itu
kita um
no I think okay since before that right like on the first day kita
then kita rest balik dekat container then the gym is not that far then I'd rather we just gym at night
oh wait tapi kau takut kau takut kau takut kan kalau nak pergi okay okay pagi let's go pagi gym pagi gym aku lupa sorry
okay okay kau lari kan so me and haizat kita dalam gym kau lari dalam container lah kita buka window so we can see each other
whoever kalah then must go out chase you again then go back in then we on replay oh itu dah cardio dah fuyoh
I think aku quite relax
tapi aku macam lepas aku dah gym I really need to shower
lepas trampoline park kan dah sweaty sweaty semua the first thing that we're going to come out of haizat mouth is let's grab back ah I mean wait wait wait wait trampoline park dekat mana
okay lah I mean I don't mind grabbing there first cause like if we're about to I think I'd rather we just like wake up early then start our day early lah then macam

hey tapi banyak seh
penat sia satu um we need to be mentally prepared satu kau punya pantat kena duduk satu jam satu itu semua lah
unless kalau they give us like you know like a questionnaire untuk kita buat or I mean like not questionnaire atau paper but I think macam they ask us a question that you have to elaborate begitu aku rasa it will be better
macam aku interview orang so macam kita kan seleksi yang better compared to us having a normal conversation and we don't have that case conversation macam kena record

being independent ya because kalau kau belajar overseas kau takde you have no excuse to know not how to cook
you must know how to cook to survive because kalau kau cakap home mak aku masak aku tak nak masak

oh yang lelaki tu kan
eh they gave him macam
apa conditional a warning
aku rasa itu macam ada orang ought to see
like it's me kalau benda seorang yang benda sama ya
but macam kalau if you put it in term macam macam kita as a human punya equality
macam diri kita sendiri macam tak kisah orang tu race tu apa what is his race but logically like if you murder sama macam aku seorang you have
macam it's logic for someone to kena gantung ke
macam you murder someone
logically who kena gantung this is like um like the basic macam law that we know lah but
I don't know what derives dia punya court macam kasih conditional warning see the word conditional warning

cepat lah please
aku rasa kan kita akan fail kita punya first try
no I think that use moment english but I use one malay so aku tak tahu like is like the same
uh takpe lah takpe lah
it's okay at least kita cuba and get the experience
I would say aku pernah kerja sekali hari ini satu kali
towkay towkay oh ya aku nak cari kau
aku try ini like small business yang buat macam
small business um bag ke sebab aku tengah cari small business untuk collaborate for open a giveaway
like aku nak support dia orang lah
okay I don't know I mean I mean ah oh kalau kau kena kena giveaway prize apa
kalau it's you prize apa yang kau nak
sebab aku ah apa tu
aku dapat satu semua besok satu kalau besok dia just started
so macam aku nak ini di situ saya turun orang so it's like a phone case punya business
kejap okay tak apa if he were to send you a gift that is a bloody portrait
kalau betul lah eh tiba-tiba kau dengan dia together malay malay if kalau betul kau dengan dia together
dah dah dah dah that's right err
and the flirting turns into like is a conversation how I talk to all my other friends so kalau if if kalau kau tengah berbual dengan dia and kau kau macam just cakap
eh kau kelakar seh aku suka berbual dengan kau
ya exactly so why you not talking to me that is a flirt you leave the person like eh siala why she talk like that she want me flirt to her ah oo la la so that's when kalau kau dah cakap macam asal kau tak berbual dengan aku ya exactly kau tak nak berbual aku pe kau busy sangat pe I'm not that important
okay dengar dulu so after you're in a relationship that after that your partner if they say is it weird dah dah dah
no tak when you meet him
like gap lah macam he probably thinks that kau macam lagi kaya or some shit like that right
I know prior to that he keep saying macam
acting eh macam kau self-realisation padahal tak ada apa-apa habuk pun takde
no like is it like macam is it
oh my god why wait what it's just let to me specific Tinder atau uh Okcupid
Muzmatch is good there's a lot of um naive girls because you really really go through macam
to to the tee punya macam this one really my mother and my father must know if I go out date with you must bring you home must tell mummy daddy that is okay that's fine if you have the maturity of
amin abeh amin
correct ya this shit will end bro it will end if you really love your boyfriend you will listen to your boyfriend hundred percent if your boyfriend say tak nak kau you won't kau tak akan break up dengan mata air kau just to lepak dengan budak syafiq ni that means you're saying that this fella is much more important than that guy
if your correct if if if shit gets comfortable then you say I just want to hang with my friends then your boyfriend say ah buat apa
because I don't like you atau you don't like me either ways there was something more than a friend you give me no fucking purpose you give me money aku kasi uh I aku kasi kau berbual dengan dia dia tak bayar kau duit
atau dia bagi kau knowledge dia tak bagi kau opportunities in life get the fuck out because I'm your fucking best friend cause to me is like
to have any fucking goals to be busy with other shit than to lepak
would would not get mad with you meh he will get mad what pasal kau dah kau dah pernah berbual dengan dorang and and the way that your and your boyfriend will probably be pissed off because
if syafiq keeps telling you eh lepak ah lepak ah lepak ah when the first meeting problem starts with eh I didn't before sia there's there's gonna be this part of like
I would say because dia very religious kan kau just cakap macam just playfully flirt lah macam
things that make him feel like oh she really wants my attention like eh kau tak berbual dengan aku eh dah lama tak rindu seh or something like that so
it's not haram what I mean okay it is haram because you have the intention but then
I don't like people who lie I don't like people who chase after me I don't like people who like macam step uh apa ni eh uh like you can flirt lah but then like
faham tak it's so many red flags sorry but
I would further macam I would pursue him
faham tak so bila kau dah macam together dengan dia not not if let's say he starts to
like it's either you are a good boy atau you are manipulative
for real huh dia hantar you portrait kimak budak-budak kental pe sia confirm aku cakap dengan kau
you kena cheated also eh we might know he's fucking seeing girls now we don't know
pukiwek three years abeh kena cheated eh siala
you need to ask for details so if he is the type of man that is like macam
kawan aku legit bila aku kecil-kecil kan dia memang betul religious habis the family and very baik so
shy baik and are religious so she she talk to guys from Muzmatch Muzmatch because she's shy to talk to guys in real life and she's also very religious so is very scary lah for you to just macam socialise what
she's the type that don't even wear tudung depan uh pakcik makcik
so legit eh ada orang datang pakai tudung pakai tudung that kind of thing atau macam
eh uh berbual pun baik macam budi bahasa macam lembut so when when she go out with these kind of uh men uh
um pasal everyday they remind themselves ah oh jin selalu ada kalau tempat dua-dua berduaan jin cepat masuk that's fucking true let's be real macam and and that's why to me
in my head is like um if she already said that I want this this this this you you shouldn't complain cause if that's not the type of girl the ratio of the halal and haram is not for you
kau masih nak try try try tapi kau tak up there then how nobody's asking you for a lot of money people asking you for respect towards the girl so this is um
how do I say this ah everytime I give my friend benefit of the doubt I'm always right so macam
eventually will come true whatever I say maybe because whether it was lame maybe that's why sekarang ni dia macam cakap ni cakap tu so if she she say she don't want it then kalau um
he should know better what right that's what I'm saying you should have Muzmatch sia this is not like macam remeh-temeh girl tau it's not like macam
for me to and not because like eh aku no no no I mean my gift alhamdulillah is I can make anybody be fucking comfortable with me so I use that to my advantage
I'm nowhere where I'm at now but I fucking promise one day I'll get up there that is the kind of fucking response I want to get from a man faham tak
you're at his fucking like stage in life where your fucking life is so hard like macam you're going through a lot of uh problems but you have so much to do with it
you are not small boy it's not like eh family aku my family is uh uh poor I mean uh mak bapa aku sakit abeh aku masih kat sekolah
itu aku boleh bagi ah tapi buto kalau kau tengah kerja kau masih nak complain
you know that's why in my in my head is like macam
and like macam I just see through the fucking bullshit I'm not going to lie sometimes when I date date someone also
uh I'm blinded that was the one yang dengan the arab guy that I was with yang macam aku betul-betul sayang but dia macam
like dalam islam pun cakap a good girl is for a good guy if you don't get it maybe you should self-check so cakap dengan dia gitu maybe that's why I don't get the girl is so simple as that
if if you want to say that kalau kau nak macam if you play by insecurity saying that aiya aku tahu lah aku ni buruk aku tahu lah
and then diam lah sial macam do something about it because you're not handicapped there's so many other people that kena burn on the face
and can do nothing about it but did they fucking complain no like macam ya so
you already fucking put your dignity on the fucking floor you step on it already you send a girl a portrait what the fuck sorry aku macam really that's that's weird
it's weird ah macam
how to say ah it's weird it's weird unless kau macam
fan mail then legit kena call fan sia fan I also want to vomit sia huh kau fanatic dia ni when she's just a pretty girl there's no such thing other than that
no you should tell him straight ah eh kimak kau lame pe kau hantar perempuan gini that means before aku kau hantar perempuan apa eh macam tiba-tiba
what the fuck do you do with your free time kau scroll perempuan lawa pastu kau hantar portrait
if you don't like him right trust me if you don't like him I I know that kau perangai kakak-kakak kau punya orang boleh steady punya tapi kau dah kau dah suka
once you date me you die already you die already all my my macam bipolar attitude
all my shout I tell you already what I'm abusive what back then lah you know like I don't give a like bro aku boleh ambil kaca aku boleh campak sia muka kau pun aku boleh pecah kan sia and as a guy also
who the fuck macam owes you a fucking living that you have to change them your mother father lah but not your partner faham tak so
that's why to me is like if you are at this stage to like kau dah mature enough don't lower your standard for a man who doesn't
and I'm not saying you shouldn't be with him I have friends who literally the the guy masuk jail cakap once you are a millionaire then you marry me and he fucking learn eh
that is weird let's see kalau kau betul-betul cut contact let's see who else he send the portrait to bet ah
faham tak cause
ya so that's why aku cakap kau it it all takes time what people especially when you like someone bro
and you've never been he been been uh at his lowest point of uh point in his life have you ever be that kau tengok kau boleh tahan ke tak
you fucking tell me engkau then apa diam ah sial then you want you have a better goal lah like it's simple as that macam
uh that that that that's where I play my game faham tak of like
I pick my battle lah macam okay this guy is enough for me
tell you before leh fuck bro kimak aku punya boyfriend dulu eh perempuan hantar dia macam
eh I saw you around school you look cute aku maki sia buto siapa perempuan ni dia nak tengok-tengok you buat apa dia pasal what
asal kau you can be vulnerable but at the same time you have you have to be like I know I know sleepy
bapa aku sia nama bapa aku sial
then you're much more clearer instead of nevermind just let it be it's okay so that's why I'm telling you kalau
if he if he's not confident he don't pass the confidence punya
wait but then saturday sunday kau buat apa kau keluar dengan dia
okay ya then then just hang with them like macam you want to have fun that is that is that is proper fun bro
stop it like macam if you tell your if tell your oh my god I don't accept that shit like my my partner got tell me before macam
oh I went out with this girl I tak pernah I tak pernah
dia gila-gila kan I tapi I tak pernah uh apa ni
my boyfriend said that he doesn't he just use like he just know that oh this girl got got macam
all due respect like he try to not I don't even know if he does that lah but he said as like macam okay I'm just your friend I'm just your friend but then I simplicate whatever text you send me so he told me that he never liked her at all
you want to fucking go out with her because she got connection because she can give you some sort of like macam um
help with ke apa lan jiao
go ahead with it or whatever kalau macam nak tanya advice about macam kerja in the future ke apa go ahead with it but I'm not
like macam is not more of like macam oh I reciprocate back
so right now you are reciprocating back if your boyfriend were to tell you in the future you ada keluar dengan dia tak you pernah keluar dengan dia tak I was fond of him lah
tapi I tak pernah mata air dengan dia
I can safely say that because I went out with a guy that fucking cheated kena cheated three times still fucking stupid
ah aku pun nak terkencing so how many more
so you telling me I want to belanja you or what
motherfucker aku nak patah balik I need to go back
tak boleh lah you cannot be distracted
oh they cakap that she probably want to get a divorce suddenly so deep ah
a'ah lama seh tak jumpa
my work cancel ah pasal COVID
tengah cari kerja ah ah
because dulu I kerja macam
events gitu lah then events semua macam
tak ada events gitu so
tak apa lah
ada skillsfuture semua you know
um dekat ah yang lain semua mahal ah
you sekolah apa ah
I uh that time I a bit scared ah because macam COVID still a lot kan
ya tak tak keluar tak kerja tak anything
eh you kerja apa again
oh gitu
irritating kan macam kerja berat sangat gitu nak buat like you know
tak ada mood eh
duduk office right ya a'ah
but either way I don't like to work at home then your your your school pun home based juga ke apa
always all the way like that ke pasal COVID
I'm already malas because like the first
two month you know circuit breaker I really tak keluar rumah
then uh ya then after that then it was so hard to go out again macam
tak tak jadi circuit breaker circuit baker tak
siapa kisah uh nevermind lah like that time I was so bored
like I make the the you know the brown sugar pearl then the dalgona coffee semua I make
tak ada kerja ah
ya tapi tak jadi ah some some some okay some
ya some success then some is like macam
tak jadi ah then I'm try to make apam balik but it's like
not that nice like pasar malam kind
tak apa ah
oh wow but I don't like to order kat luar because like
actually I eat macam benda yang tak halal ah macam no pork no lard I just makan you know
ya lah ya lah like kalau keluar kan boleh like choose whatever I want to eat you know
apa tinggal mana ang mo kio
oh ya that one also aku ada story
eh but jurong okay what I don't know I mean at least when I go there kan macam
a whole new world for me ah like macam tak biasa at all ah but then ya I used to like cause I was thinking macam jurong kan ada
banyak ah ya so it's like whenever I go there then tak tau nak makan apa ya so
ya maybe that's why we never like meet each other because you always there but then you go town a lot kan kerja and school
tak keluar juga ya lah ya lah
uh you know mister teh tarik gitu ah
gitu lah
rajin like more rajin in the kitchen right
then my mum was like oh bila nak kahwin you know things like that
I tempted you know because recently dia orang kata uh like
majlis like only ten people or something
ya apa ni
but you attached or tak
I see some of the comments kat facebook kan dia orang kata macam
dah dah dah lima then groomsmen like lagi lima orang
that's why then I was like patut lah
ya then they were like macam bising ah like uh
uh with my majlis perkahwinan then I'm just like
tak tak faham ah
tak tahu ah the name semua macam sama gitu I don't know ya
you boleh drive tak
so when I work at events because usually they pay quite high so I don't mind smiling you know like oh hi welcome to apa apa apa you know then
now like go out everything like because everyone wear mask what then also I think people cannot recognise me so I'm quite happy like I mean not like I famous ke apa lah
you don't want to tegur like that then you just like alamak dia ni lagi then
oh oh ya ya ya ya ya ya betul tak tak sombong ah nanti dia cakap sombong then you know cause usually never wear wear the mask then they'll be like
uh eh you very sombong eh sekarang like then I'm like
you penat kerja then you just like you know zone out and then you just walk home or something but then sometimes I bumped into them then I never see then dia orang kata I like macam
sekarang dah sombong eh what what what then I'm just like what you know so
now wear mask bedek-bedek oh tak perasan lah like you know like ya but I understand what you mean by rimas also I think that one is just because singapore is hot
nak snow tak nak ah that one kiamat already
actually I don't know whether I want to still work with them I like recently I got like macam change of heart
dah tua ah like macam tiring ah events
my friend dia nak jadi temperature screener kan dekat kedai tu kan
then dia orang kata mesti ada diploma then I'm like
susah sangat ke temperature screener you know like apa seh
tak makes sense ah I think dia orang macam sengaja nak
buat susah you know then they complain like you know oh nobody want to apply padahal
tapi the people like freaking toxic seh then I cannot take it then I just like say like I don't want to come back
kerja apa uh teaching
ah tak but I got um biasa ah tuition experience and like you know
I do events so I can quote unquote handle classroom gitu
ya then apa lagi eh uh
ya then now also like nak classroom but then because you have to adhere to the COVID regulations then like macam
every hour kena sanitise gitu ah like ugh
then macam malas gitu ah
ya but this one dia toxic ah the the
the other teacher no actually actually the the other teachers are quite okay lah cuma the management ah like macam
ngada-ngada ah I don't know how to say
then like the first three days the management tak datang so I'm like okay ah this job like not bad ah I quite enjoying myself like still not very
like macam
not very good friends with the rest of the teacher but boleh lah can manage lah you know not so
um tengok how I work lah you know
then then they say a lot bad things about me then dia orang
ya she damn cari pasal ah like with me like semua benda yang I buat which I think is like
not even her problem dia macam tak okay
then I like malas already then ya then like
if I know everything why I training right like bodoh pe perempuan ni
uh then then I know what he what they she roughly mean ah I don't get like everything but I boleh faham sikit-sikit ah
aku baru then aku tak tahu apa-apa you know things like that then I'm like
or is it the next day or something like that then she like tegur me ah she was like
then she was like okay I'm going to test you then I'm like eh kau orang belum ajar aku apa-apa then kau orang nak test aku
I know how to do lah gitu so I managed to pass the test lah then she was like okay actually um I think you can
uh you don't know anything so I uh that time I'm just like malas seh nak datang balik
you want kira work from home ah I don't want seh
but then now I I see like macam dia orang dah potong semua pokok semua I don't know what the hell they are doing but okay lah I guess
my friends semua macam introvert dengan homebody juga so it was quite fun lah for us circuit breaker we just
all on our computer then we all just like zoom call each other macam
you ask them to jumpa right like like
too wild too long in that's why I'm like macam
but then my parents dia orang macam nak my sis my younger sister to marry first
tak ah I think my relationship longer but my relationship uh I'm also attached to a non-muslim
ya it makes things more complicated ah I guess then my sister she macam
she attached dengan muslim guy so that's already one
macam sekarang right I was thinking like is it
marriage is just like macam
eh but then you know what so scary leh like macam
um recently kan I baca kat
facebook ah now now got a lot of free time what so more time to browse facebook gitu semua
wah then ah so if cause to me right macam kalau kita relationship then they cheat right at least we can break off
need lawyer need to sign things all macam ugh malas ah
uh tak I think they give up on me already
that's why like recently I you know rajin-rajin in the kitchen then dia orang macam
oh um izzati finally can get married gitu you know but then I'm just like
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much kalau tahu I just
I mean I'm not sure if it's will be gonna be fun lah but you know at least like now I know that I'm not busy working because I don't think I want to be a working mum when I'm like heavily pregnant gitu you know
like chiongster also lah kerja banyak and things like that then my parents also not happy ah because like
supposedly twenty five kita kena dah married already you know but then I was still like working my ass off lah
mm mm betul lah then what huh
kita pun ada cakap ah like discuss are you okay with living with my in-laws for a while
then she say it's like hell lah because the mother in-law macam
like have a lot of expectations of her gitu
but sometimes kecoh is fun you know
or you mean the other kind of kecoh
I know that's why but I've talked to her before then she cakap dia tak nak ah she nak cari rumah sendiri juga
like you know hari raya you pergi like rumah kat jurong then mesti ada kucing punya I don't know ah I don't know how to say ya
I never say ah bukan aku cakap eh
oh pergi pasir ris then I oh pergi changi okay then pergi jurong ah I
seram seh
oh but recently my sister kena then I was like what the hell
a bit overconfident lah dia orang kata
so so it's like I'm like oi uh why you follow me like you know padahal I'm just a
sometimes dia orang will follow from a distance which I can still like macam
buat bodoh lah you know then
there was one guy who even like macam
naik kan then you know usually you go whenever whichever door is nearest to you and that is
and actually because I want to lean ah because I malas
recently kan I feel like macam I want to move to the west side because
ya so it's like macam I feel like if I live nearer to the west it will be easier for me to get a job there
life you know like sometimes the the kerja is like so far away from your rumah then it's like ugh malas ya
so ya lah ya lah macam I think if I'm nearer to the west I probably won't uh what
ya lah cause in ang mo kio like macam nobody ever sleeps
then sometimes like three kan ada orang cakap-cakap kat telefon then dia orang ketawa like laugh their heart out then I feel like so irritated you know
because he also still studying then he want to like uh like what you say lah macam nak habiskan sekolah dulu
sebab dia nak jadi teacher so now he studying the subject
because he wants to work at punya kind of school
ya and then that when during within that eight years right he still haven't kerja you know so I have I probably still have to wait another few years for him to be able to afford a house
say before that he is macam
like when he got school kan dia nak
uh but then that semester break it I think is is macam charity
that's why just like normal expenditure kan it's not like saving for a house gitu you know
ah cina lah
I was workaholic also lah then macam
whatever lah actually I was kind of those kind like oh I I independent woman I tak nak kahwin tak nak
ada children all then in the end
saje jer like you know like
try try cause nowadays got macam banyak apps gitu lah you know and websites also
so just make friends ah because I feel like macam
my age kan like orang semua dah kahwin then dia orang macam tak nak hang out so much
I suddenly meet him then suddenly like eh macam eh actually like if we get married and have a life together macam fun gitu juga eh ya so

mm damn fikir-fikir balik aku rasa aku pun struggle a lot lah but those issues was only faced during in like year three ah so bu
I had a lot of assignments dengan to complete and it was really nerve wrecking for my internship cause it was at a hospital lah
tapi in all I guess my poly life was quite fun and interestin
mm aku tak tahu ah macam mana nak bagi kau tips but because like it really depends on your course since I was in biomed kan more of my assignment was more into like theory based punya</malay
tengok kalau aku nak bagi kau tips pun aku rasa tak manfaat kot cause kau pernah bilang aku that your course is design righ
err I'm currently working full time at P&G as lab analyst dekat</malay
it's a microbiology lab ah so called kau akan buat testing to like you know facial products and shit like that penat sia kerja I mean like there's there was a lockdown right like during the COVID perio
mm aku actually actually planning untuk sambung sekolah cause aku rasa righ
oh aku tak tahu that your sister was in because I'm planning to go to juga um as a part time student in biomedical engineering cours
aku rasa part time student is the best for me right no
mm pelik kau punya cousin boleh pecahkan kau punya specs sia
mm maybe lah if I got time err in the future and maybe I have enough money aku temankan kau buat specs lah cause I feel like I also need specs my degree also keep increasin
mm we can't really go outside unless they are for like necessities and stuff like that ya rindu seh keluar dengan kawan semua especially karaok
mm like I say limited places sebab like some places pukul sepuluh dah tutup seh so macam</malay
ya that sounds like a good plan tapi like as I said mm semua orang pun busy aku pun busy juga since I'm looking full tim
um ahead kau nak pergi staycation err
kau ada ke hotel that you find interesting at the moment like any kind of promotion that you see or stuff like tha
mm actually that place one pun bagus juga ah I went there for my friend's birthday bash that was like pre period like before circuit perio
kalau ada room service pun baik juga</malay
mm talking about shangri la I came across the article dekat apa tu the smart local if I'm not wrong pasal the shangri la
I don't know lah it's entirely up to you I don't know I also don't know when the promo ends also I aku rasa it's end of this septembe
tak salah aku ah
aku dengar-dengar kau punya kawan pun kerja dekat shangri la how was the place like I know my friend work there before but has
he said the food there nice lah but tak halal lah
mm ya maybe we should ah but we really have to plan well I guess I mean kalau tak boleh staycation pun I guess we can do other activities cause like there's a lot of dessert places and also like food places we can visit I have a list of it lah maybe I ca
ya I remember pemalas malas nak jalan oh I remember that cafe I think it's like hot chicks or somethin
aku recommend kau pergi I mean we we can go to cat cafe dekat rail mal
very cute kau boleh main dengan kucing while you like have your dessert or some stuff mm cause I saw this on my friend's instagram and it looks really cute and the price is also not so bad lah it's affordable and other than tha
the mind cafe is just like macam apa ni you go there and then you order some drinks and you can play games like board games and stuff like tha
seems interesting but that malay cafe that you're talking about sounds really shady asal pergi sana aku pun tak tahu
uh uh mm maybe can ajak ayu also ah bu
pelik it's weird ah I scared I'm awkward with her I mean you you're closer with her I guess I don't kno
I mean ya lah aku tahu during secondary school I was a nerd lah cause I was really focusing on like you know finishing my O's going poly and shit s
I mean I had a I I mean I talk to guys during that period but I don't think dating was an option cause I mean you look at our school lah lelaki semua pecah sia
let's be honest can't they're I mean they are not pecah but they're not like you know nice people so I rather not be attached to the
I will do my part also I guess you don't really need to show everything online lah for me ah cause aku rasa kalau if show everything online nanti kalau kau orang break what what you going to do all the pictures will be gone and it's a waste of effort plu
I don't know I just don't like sharing it's weird I I don't know how you all do it like kau orang just post pictures of each other and stuff like that I'll I'll feel weird doing that I guess it's just not me ah
a few days you can come to work kan macam tak fair seh kau tak akan earn tak akan apa ni hold duit yang cukup untuk sekolah and for your own like needs sebab aku tengok kau design kau selalu macam</malay
kena pakai printers semua untuk print kau punya project so tu semua pakai duit sia
huh someone got fired who sia siapa seh what happen I'm curiou
tak baik seh manager too I mean she's doing baking what is she suppose to split herself int
apa eh orang kata be mor
flexible I guess like if she's really busy baking for the shit right I mean baking for like you know the breads and stuff like that then like at least her as a manager she can handle the cashier what tak salah pe asal dia macam gini sia tak faham seh
on with that kind of salary plus um aku ada bilang kau ke tak yang aku punya matair sekarang tengah kerja temperature taking righ
dia punya his pay also got cut like previously it was twelve dollars right but now they cut it to eight fift
really face this kind of people like kesian ah juga cause of this like COVID thing right so they had to hire people for like temperature screener but some people are jus
safe entry damn leceh leh huh must walk one round ah just to go to the entrance I mean like it's for your own safety also gila ah
gila</malay
gila sia this kind of people like tak ikut rules abeh yang like they they are they they are the one who's doing something wrong abeh kita orang pula yang salah but it is what it is lah what can we d
you blah blah blah but I don't know don't really like ikut sangat cakap orang</malay
in short overall everything will work out fine anyways aku dengar after your interview kau keluar dengan kawan kau kan pergi mana jer merayap jer kerja</malay
like he pay for your stuff and he didn't do anything creep like that ustaz who is a creeper don't know why you go out with those kind of guys also those disgustin
plus sixteen ex is quite a lot so what does that mean he he matair for like two months habis tu break then another girlfriend is it sixteen banyak sia
just focus focus on yourself lah lagipun kau lagi muda there are other things for you to worry about like your school and your career there's a lot of things in front of you you have to achieve before you know finding the right on
pelik ah
age is not an issue ah because um kawan aku I have this friend ah my friend he's working together with me right no
age tak kisah seh I mean kalau kau lagi ada macam semangat kau nak sambung sekolah and you have the time why no
but I tell him the more he delay the more he procrastinate until when seh dia nak ambil like nak finish the degree then he was like and I've I also advised him lah lik
mm tak habis-habis go jer part time rabak</malay
a'ah I guess he just need to time have proper time management ah but aku dah tengok dia punya schedule dia punya modules and stuff like that I mean in short while if got wheels things will go on smoothly lah but I mea
aku lapar sia kau lapar</malay

mm tu ah
dekat you know compass one right
eh babi
macam main golf
what happened to them ah actually dia orang gaduh
dah dah dah dah bagi
alah sedihnya
lelaki eh kau fikir
laki aku lah dia suka
I think after six months you already dah dah dah tak kisah ya
feelings balik
they'll I don't know what what power lah okay but macam dia orang they have like this mindset right that they okay anything I say or anything I do confirm girls confirm girls will fall for it
aku dah cakap lah dia dia kalau comfortable dengan orang tu dia dia selalu buat gitu
adik kau pilih si izuan ke ah dia cakap eh kau ni bapak kau tak lawa tak handsome ke macam
I don't know why many people many girls find izuan handsome termasuk kau but
I don't know it's just me even elfie cakap tau ya ya oi that time aku tanya dia eh
eh iya ke jazli and izuan handsome
then dia kata a'ah not bad why abeh dia cakap dia orang handsome ke because most girls find find them handsome
kau jangan wei sembilan belas ada yang dah tunang sia
dua puluh satu dah nak kahwin seh
I mean some other way kau boleh macam
if the feelings hilang already what
his one right I think his type of like macam
convincing or talk or apa apa ah in general
his type is to like macam lead you on
okay macam okay
humairah said that he still like macam cakap to you cakap
maybe now he's facing problems that's why he tak itu
so jangan don't don't think that that is the end of the world also
mm cheat juga so it's two ways
tak nak tanya lah
toxic bodoh
oh mana aku tahu aku ingatkan perempuan tu
you can't K the thing is kau tak boleh expect like a guy to look so great
cause that's when you know macam kau kau confirm tak boleh dapat
you know it's not their hati yang gatal it's bawah dia orang gatal
terus dia reject
kau reject eh
oh ya kau tolak eh kau cakap I I'm still moving on
I think he said because kau dah bilang apa izuan alim gila semua dia solat semua kan zack is the opposite what that's why he feels like very competitive gitu dia tak suka
alah kesiannya you but did you tell him that
kau cakap apa dalam letter tu
comelnya okay
you should just tell him that kau orang together not because your expectation of a guy is
macam you should say that at least he tried it's easier
oh dia comel bodoh dia kata dia solat
okay I mean dia tak teruk seteruk aku tau but
kawan pun boleh eventually turn out to be so
that's that is the beauty of like having friends lah itu jer
selenge aku ketuk kau kan kepala ke kau kau cakap pasal si zack depan-depan dia sia
aku I was like laughing behind the screen I was like I want to look at izuan's reaction
ya tapi dalam hati tu mesti sakit padan muka
ya lah okay you're you're moving on two months dia dah break up dengan kau two months
it's kenal-kenal
guys who kenal-kenal me also
you know that day yang kita pergi hantar kereta
it's me humairah dengan lagi tiga ekor tu
kita ajak sia the day before
abeh kau cakap oh tomorrow I have the meeting
ya then after that kau cakap kita cakap okay do well for your meeting
yang meeting yang interview tu kau cakap lepas tu tiba-tiba aku text kau kau cakap oh my my interview was err last err is next week aku macam
very blur aku sepak actually at the end of the day aku tanya kau kau nak ikut besok
nine nine six nine apa
then the queue was like panjang
no no err kita kita semua naik nine six nine balik ya ya umirah then after that no we were queueing kan
then sekali err two of us were walking in front
sekali yang kat belakang tu tertinggal then got other people then them ah lepas tu aku dengan humairah tengah cakap cakap ah I I wasn't talking I was on my handphone
then aku cakap err not really just cakap cakap jer
because I got the dating app also then after that err dia cakap I asked her back lah you have boyfriend before
dia kata if I'm not wrong dia cakap err
that guy the guy yang kerja dengan dia kat tu
yes she told me she told me about his macam apa cakap oh dia dulu budak madrasah and stuff like that
then after that err dan mak dia tak suka humairah
ya and then after that I was like I was so shocked lah like mak dia tak suka
like the girl dia punya ex gaduh dengan gaduh ya I'm like
ya exactly it's not her what humairah madrasah ke takkan alim jer
you know that a guy from madrasah
suka dengan budak madrasah yang lagi satu then I'm like
but but look like at the kids yang dah pernah madrasah even if I don't know they have done it
K but very annoyed itu cerita lain ke
I literally gave up you know when he said that aku macam tak nak gaduh lah diam jer lah
he said what layer layer layer aku cakap am I not layering that one
feel uncomfortable ah like macam
okay it's not it's not bad that he tegur but tegur tu like
cakap baik-baik not not say
it's not his tone it's the way he say it he macam cakap can you not wear like that macam gitu
nanti lelaki will think otherwise that one that that one I don't mind
if he says like that I don't mind but he says as if I'm the I'm the macam I'm the one wrong
tu pasal aku dah macam marah that's why I was pissed
aku dah cakap apa terang-terang like kau nak pakai itu kau kau kalau cuci mata gitu then it's not my problem
aku pun pissed gila wei gitu dengar
I don't know we were talking about oh no kat dalam kereta lepas hantar kau orang balik
lepas tu aku tanya dia like husni was like talking because kita tiga jer kan dah biasa
then after that we just talk ah macam
err we need to talk about like macam kesiankan adina semua kenapa dia emo gitu
lepas tu aku bilang lah dia orang macam apa jadi
like as in apa jadi as in like uh why is she still feeling sad lah gitu
then aku just cakap in my opinion I think
dia masih belum move on gitu ya then after that ya
mm and then lepas tu
husni cakap maybe
err husni came to a conclusion he just said that um
because like uh that is why you shouldn't play dating app ni semua
ya then after that aku macam it's like aku cakap ah macam sometimes you just play the dating app just to get to know the person itu jer
for fun also what kau nak kenal-kenal orang jer pe
tell me that uh takpe kau kalau buat pun jaga-jaga tau lelaki ni semua tak bagus
then after that aku cakap lah aku cakap dengan dia like uh the guy I talking to that irfan
I told him that about that guy ah macam mana dia cakap dengan aku gitu
husni cakap ya just um next time just be careful jer lah
then kata aku cakap um
aku bilang husni ah aku tanya dia in my in your opinion lah do you think it's even that obvious can you even see
pasal tu husni cakap no you cannot see anything what
it's just one line dah tu jer
wah it'll it will trigger me right if he say that dulu kau pakai tutup aurat lepas tu kau pakai gini
tak he never say that before but if he says it that I'm gonna flip out sia
and the thing yang aku pakai tadi kan baju tu kan yang colour purple you cannot see anything what
ya it's just the ke belakang what
pasal dia tak berani nak cakap apa-apa that's why
kirakan apa birthday surprise dia bodoh
buka buka gitu birthday surprise
lupakan jer aku tak kisah
aku pakai gitu pun like I fikir about my family
relatives semua dah tahu aku dulu pakai tudung semua
mm itu sebab apa because that one time I suddenly change ah I just suddenly like that tak pakai tudung
nenek aku makcik aku ah like because kita dah rapat gila that's why I don't mind what they say ah
then she she very abeh dia baru lagi
I I I just jawab ah tak ah dekat jer nak buat apa
lepas tu dia kata huh gitu eh
ah gitu lah buat apa
so just kalau kau tak pakai takpe lah
this is the first time I post about yang I tak pakai tudung just ambil gambar biasa jer kan
not tegur as in bad tegur ah dia orang macam cakap eh lawanya
I'm not trying to brag ah but they said eh lawanya kau pakai gini
then I was like oh okay thank you gitu
just so I don't try to bring it up lah gitu
lag ke
pasal dah ya lah
tak lah
aku pergi mongolia royalty tu
even the girls that I know that pakai tudung kan right
they they buka somewhat they same time as me I mean after me
I have no idea but they they buka also leh like they suddenly just tak pakai
cause dah biasa kan dah daripada dulu kecil then after that
kecil as in I started seriously wearing sec one
then the lepas tu holiday pasal aku ada internship kan aku tak pakai
then from then aku tak pakai
sebab tu aku macam like a bit hesitant to wear lah
it's very stupid if they ban that lah macam bodoh sangat lah
that's that's the bad thing you know because it's your adik right then you are the kakak you're supposed to show example then they they have the mindset that
ya you're supposed to learn from your kakak that's all
I mean doesn't suit as in macam kau tak ready gitu
lepas kahwin then okay lah maybe
like because we ignored it right macam kau try to avoid it that's why dia dah malas nak cakap
kalau aurat tu boleh tunggu I know it's a good thing to
obviously you ngaji kena pakai pe
tak lah tak lah tak lah kau jangan
kau macam really lapar sia
macam kering sia tekak aku
boleh juga ah
funan ada apa siol
lebih baik kau boleh buat sendiri siol
kan kau tunjuk aku gambar tu hari
ya oh wah lawa seh
perm balik
I texted you I say because I saw your your hair macam ada bangs then I I was like
aku rebond ni jer
kalau if you dye your rambut nak colour apa
oo yang it hides under jer
itu cool gila seh
their service is okay ah both for both ah karva dengan pearlista
a bit more macam
ya it's kind of affordable lah especially for students right kalau kau pergi pun
ya I mean for the day itself kalau kau nak book obviously full lah dia orang tak ambil lah
macam that time I do my nails for graduation
then I was like pasal aku tak boleh sampai kan kaki aku then plus kaki aku kecil after that they were like
eh I can charge you for children's price then aku macam ah children's price
because it was a voucher yang kita beli dekat you know celeb fest kan kadang-kadang ada kan
ya and then after that makcik aku beli so it's hundred dollars altogether
it's hundred dollars altogether so fifty for me fifty for her then fifty tu aku pakai untuk perming ah so buat pedicure
ada sikit leftover then they refund sikit
so aku macam okay lor
tak pernah eh I just don't want to do anymore it looks very unclean that's why
later a long time later nanti dia karat ya that's why I don't like
rambut jer buat rambut jer
your nails don't bother
or if you like this pendek right beach wave
eh no bukan beach wave
dia tak banyak volume it's like just a bit gitu
then it's lawa
I think today there's really not much to talk about lah because macam
there was a lecture online today tu jer ah
talking so slowly and plus dia start the lesson lambat
but dia datang lambat
really really kau asyik datang sekolah lambat seh
no but the previous semester usually kau on time for school
speaking of attendance kau tahu aku that time dapat email dari sekolah cakap
just masalah ni like macam
okay K this is err out of topic but like you know leh ni tak tahu siapa asyik reply aku punya tak eh reply aku punya pula always like replying to my instagram stories
yes yes you know this person and dia ah sama course dengan kita masa I think sekarang pun sama lah
mm boleh can
ya Q asyik reply to my eh why do I keep saying reply to my apa tu lah reply to my ah instagram story
but it when he reply right it's always the randomness things macam for example if
and then he will wah tempat ni kat mana seh
no tapi actually dia punya his malay is
ini playground aku
apasal dengan budak ni ah maybe
ya and then but tapi recently kan
so dia macam tanya eh this week intern apa eh this this week is what week of internship like as if he tak ada classmate nak tanya kenapa dia kena tanya aku and then
oh and then err I will reply ah this week this week twenty then the next week he will ask me this week with apa untuk intern
then I will reply the same thing we twenty one but then I don't want to tanya lah you don't have any classmate meh macam offensive seh
tak tak tak uh this one he asked me during the week of internship
while kita tengah masih intern not after
but but dia but he got message you on instagram what that time kau tunjuk aku
no lah I'm I'm not overthinking about it and I I don't like to fikir banyak sangat about this pasal anyways if
if he was actually trying if he actually ada motive kan
dia tahu pe aku ada mata air so why would he even try
my replies to him are like so boring like literally if when one talks to me they will just tidur
exactly I am the most boring person in the world and I aku tak suka social interaction
kalau if
stop it and then and then ah he asked me that this is like tengah malam so like twelve midnight
but then I was so lazy so malas to like look up the thing cause I was already in bed macam nak tidur
I told him that and then he is like oh okay tak apa dah jumpa
and I okay you just wasted my time and then he started to move on pasal
uh apa tu about what's my and everything then and
he actually pandai seh his is three point two you know
and then ah I see wah your cumulative is so good then he ask me your intern kau dapat A ah then I say
ya I get A what about you and then dia cakap dia dapat B can't believe he dapat B actually kan that time I berbual with captain ho dia cakap most of the boys dapat B meanwhile the girls get A
aiya whatever lah it's over already anyways your tinggi pe so like there's nothing to
risaukan ya
then he said alah university kalau university pun uh he will go to plymouth
apasal you like he is it ee
K K kau suka dia
tapi but we are the same height what
ah ya ya can you please tell me what happened I want to know nak tahu
notice apa why ah why leh
huh siapa yang reject kau sia I mean you're like damn pretty
aku feel so betrayed
jauh pe orchard is so far
pasal your jokes can be quite
kau tahu the wing wing joke
exactly kau tahu it's a stupid joke and yet you still tell that joke
the joke is supposed to be funny tak kelakar pun
is it is it macam blind date like you
just did not know him or kau dah nampak muka dia and then you decide to go on a date dengan dia
it's always the cute guys yang buat kita orang macam like this
I think I think you kau ada cakap telegram oh
ya he was practically ghosting kau kesian
actually ah I have one calon for you
and he is he is actually mak aku punya friend punya anak
so like but we kind of grow up together lah so sejak kecil until besar
tapi kan the thing about him is the thing about him is dia pendiam so
eh no dia macam pendiam with certain people that's what I notice about him but but
the good thing is he is older than us by a year so I think it's like secucuk for you lah
adik-adik ya stop it sia
ya and the guy is soft spoken but then I know kau suka lelaki yang boleh fight dengan kau
but he's the only candidate that aku tahu ah yang I can recommend to you
no I I told you what he is my mum's friend punya anak
so like I kenal him from young and like my mum is friends with her friends sejak dulu so mm
you you like guys yang suka bantah is it
ya I faham I faham
but that kind of person susah nak cari seh because like nowadays guys are just
I don't know you tell me is he is he like really kasar dengan kau
to to like date you and then to kahwin with you
actually uh after the truth or dare game right I thought dia
tak suka aku because like I feel like maybe
he feels malu because he had to do it so from then on macam it was like a forced thing to do and maybe he because of that dia just start to tak suka me
then I am like wasn't the tak oh is he not at me
ya lah tu
huh I don't think it was love yet because at that point of time I think he'll he'll still talking to his ex you know kau tahu
dia masih berbual-bual dengan ex dia seh ya
yes yes there was the story then ah you know then after that I teman him to go for one office takraw
punya sessions just to watch lah and then we were walking to the sports hall abeh I think kawan dia saw us walking in and then his friend took a snapchat then ah kawan dia upload to
snapchat and then eh his ex nampak lah then
yes dia playing hard to get but then she's also like macam
not sure about him but also playing hard to get macam mana
so dia orang dah break up lah
ah aku just tak suka when like uh apa tu girlfriends are like so insecure of like the boyfriend punya kawan I mean just make it clear lah that
you guys just kawan and like the girl should understand
so she's like being two faced is that what kau mean by that ular ular kepala dua is it
but why would the girl buat such a thing to the mata air sia
so aku rasa it's okay if you want to buka aib dia to me because I don't even know who he is so
wait so does that mean at some point kau pernah suka lelaki tu on
like kau orang are just platonic friends lah
the mata air dia just have issues lah I think because remember remember when aku used to have issues dengan yasmin
I don't even know why and then now kita we're friends so like look ah the turntables
no is is is it is it the office reference entah lah
speaking of the office you know my sister ah I told my kakak about uh all my internship drama in the office it was so dramatic and then she is like
the cameraman kena zoom in so it's like more dramatic and then
and then uh dia akan uh bend into like the people around dia punya reaction that will be so funny and then the title should err the office two point O
aku is the middleman because I'm the intern and I'm supposed to buat kerja for both finance and logistics
but then again finance and logistics are supposed to work together because like if they don't work together how are they macam how is the company going to maju right and then
and then after I no I will get a purchase order and invoices from logistics to do it for finance habis tu
ah after I scan and then I will pass to the finance person lah and then mesti perempuan finance ni pun cakap
asyik pass kat aku seh this one you pass back to err si logistics dulu then I'm like
what do you want me to do with this after this is dah kerja kau pe
mm it's like macam as if they make it look like macam aku tak nak buat kerja padahal
they are the ones that making kerja aku susah you know so frustrating
um I I get what you mean though because macam oh at
speaking of work also you not because of the COVID kita kena work from home
so I have to bring back my laptop and usually kat kerja I will use desktop
but then like you know laptop is so kecil dari desktop and it's so hard to navigate things and plus the system is so screwed up and is always hanging
and then oh and then aku punya boss every damn day dia akan suruh kita on zoom and he'll have a meeting with us
mm I mean ah almost hari-hari kan my boss will tanya everyone oh what is on your plate today what is on your plate today like
macam every damn day hari-hari nine thirty sharp zoom meeting without fail dia akan tanya
um kim yam road nak pergi sengkang okay lah and then plus you know bila nak pergi and balik lagi kerja kena naik turun bukit oh my goodness
ya so depressing tu turbine intern so huh
wah so jangan lah
is it jannah dari mata air
kau tak eh
who who who do you have in mind to be jannah mata air
honestly I cannot wait until jannah kahwin though because like
I will feel so happy for her macam yes
any guy yang dapat jannah is a very very lucky guy
no because you kau tahu pe I don't really have a lot of friends especially especially guy friends
sepupu aku they are either lagi tua or they're younger than me
so like I don't think jannah will be interested in dia orang
allan no no no no allan's cousins already have ah girlfriends and one of them is younger than him and I knew jannah tak suka lelaki yang younger than her
kan saya ni like shaza really shaza pula jap I mean you deserve the best also but jannah also like deserves the best
it's so merepek
it's like americans don't even take dia orang punya elections seriously and some are actually voting for kanye
orang dekat dia orang like oh have you registered to vote
it's your masa masa hadapan that you are thinking of it's the masa depan masa hadapan of your children
especially kat singapore
woke culture has been like taking over singapore punya twitter and it's really really annoying especially those influencers
it like it's macam
are you guys have to be woke in order to like macam so you guys don't ah offend siapa-siapa I'm like ugh stop it stop it
macam no offence na na na na na but ne na na na
uh actually women dia orang minta for equality I think like the proper word though use is not equality but the proper word to use is actually equity
being fair to both genders but added but at the same time ah seek catering to their needs better it's like macam for example you're looking over fence ah this guy can see because over the fence because he's tall but then
aku tak mahu bual pasal apa ni dah aku dah melalut okay nevermind
nak you pergi terancung
actually for my malay aku dapat A two no but there was only after I retake the malay paper
at first the aku dapat B three
mari lah
belajar otak you still got into so it
tak made a difference many ways was like the two best years of my studying life
and aku don't regret at all
and like it's just so lepak
ya I just miss so much and the lecturers actually do give a damn about you and your welfare not just kau punya studies
um ini apa
most of us tak suka miss judy because she was like so naggy for some reason she was so naggy
I remember ah the time yang bila kita baru dapat result for which company kita dapat for intern and then I didn't get lots but and I was so sad
so miss judy got me out of the lecture theatre and dia just she just tanya me ah apa jadi lah then why why asal I'm crying
I said I didn't get the companies that I wanted to and then she just no it's okay takpe I mean she been didn't say takpe but like it's okay
cederakan diri lah
ketabahan is like her macam patience
add to a certain extent lah that cause kau kan perempuan
you macam shiok seh tiba-tiba
it's I yang bilang
kau takde tissue that time
but but that blood was because you were you were scolding this lelaki yang tengah buang sampah sembarangan kan
she betul-betul seh
just route lain
how come I tak tahu it was a fake story
why your cats like so kasar like that if you train them
oh my god mister alan is just so comel you know
mister mister alan ada snapchat
best gila just shiok you know
eh aku tak sabar to get of the country like it's been so long already since we've been like at home and like just in singapore I'm so I'm really getting bored nowadays
ya then after that they say I don't know I actually didn't read the news so much ah but then nampak macam dorang nak buka like give us masuk like kasi kita masuk tapi macam they just I don't know what I don't know what was what happened ah because I don't really read the berita right but I was like
I mean because no no no dorang dah tutup
for like apa berapa bulan dah so like ya I mean I think ever since like the COVID really boom so much right I think they actually um close it already so like
eh betul ke
sekarang are you sure
jap for real ah
okay I guess I guess that's why I don't know because I mean aku baru kerja masa tu kan always night shift mana ada nak siapa sempat tak lah syafiq kyle not my aku dah aku dah dah sebab tak ada kan because of this COVID dah tak ada drama kan so macam dah
apa what the heck
jap so jap but did you know which one is it because I just know there's like zul ariffin
zul ariffin eh um I think I think he there was ah because you know because of COVID kan dorang tak ada buat drama baru kan like now they are in
sedih pe
okay ah but I never cause because of because of okay not really because of COVID but like a few since like a few years ago kan then I already like because of apa friends punya apa-apa nama dia I I guess influence macam gitu they be like K drama K drama K drama ya that's so
aku eh no I feel like
I mean you got to watch the drama first then after that you will be in love dengan character dia pe
lah cerita lama tak best I mean I don't really watch all cerita lama but I watch lah like at um a few years ago punya kan
I watch like macam
I swear every time he macam oh I don't know what to watch goblin and I'm like bro are you
weh boring pe tu aku tak boleh okay no matter how good a show is right I will never re-watch uh not that I'll never re-watch sebab I wouldn't go until six times three four times
but ya lah because you know after I mean I can lah because you know after watching a show right you can actually macam like you know I don't know about you ah but for me after watching a show or like when I watch this show I feel very attached to the show
boring pe aku tak boleh dok macam tu
wah okay that's is that's a new thing for me like macam a new information of someone
actually now that I think about it aku rasa aku tak tengok dia punya spiderman tom holland I just saw you know like macam all the the marvel the big big shows like the what is it called captain america eh not captain america ya civil the civil wars the last one endgame so I only like I only like apa saw that big big one are the main main shows lah I don't really watch the specific um only
ya like you know got the batman lah all that different different one right so I don't really watch yang macam tu
wah but eh but you know because of COVID also right aku this year aku binge watch banyak gila korean drama
okay jap aku okay first aku tengok doctor romantic doctor romantic one
it's a good it's really a good show it's like doctor romantic kan so it's like macam um is obviously there's but but obviously korean drama obviously ada that love scene and stuff right cause it's between two people right but then um I wouldn't really say so I feel it's okay though
korean drama in general I think it's quite I mean for the ones that I have seen I think kirakan about the love scene the love story all that is quite okay ah ya to me ah so I watched the doctor romantic first lah yang first tu so it was that that show is about apa banyak doctor doctor punya scene ah so it's like banyak so jadi punya tempat punya scene wah you know at first I was like when I first thought about that show was like eh can I actually watch because if I'm not wrong I used to be a bit disgusted by like surgery punya punya apa nama dia what do you call it uh surgery punya
I'm just I'm just like bro I really love K drama punya they are so tip top bro
I guess because when you see the like the actress and actors pakai oh my god cantik
but honestly though to think about it right they use the same equipment and they can buy the same clothes and like everything can be the same tau like as in like but it's just that why can't it why macam just macam tak sama tau aku aku pun macam
ya so I was like shit okay so dia cakap ada hotel bloom I'm like sabar am I am I suppose to wait for it macam happen like
so dia macam tak ada tak ada
ada lah yang kan aku ada buat aku tengok doctor romantic two dia ada dua dua
I mean maybe not so because kadang-kadang orang nak kan people want more so like they will keep requesting right
I want to request but I tell you korean drama eh dia banyak international fans tau
banyak gila international fans
eh even suria dorang tunjuk tau aku macam
ya ya you know cerita um my is gangnam beauty
eh park seo joon eh bro my is gangnam beauty yang
ya but it's that apa cerita pun dekat suria then I was like sabar
itu itu cerita-cerita macam gitu aku tak suka but I think I remember dulu bila back then also selalu tengok because selalu bila kecil-kecil kan mana kita ada macam sekarang ada ada box kan you know the android box that kind of thing
dulu mana ada benda tu semua kan like macam
ya so there's always a singapore nya channel so dah tengok singapore nya channel tu kan kadang-kadang like main tekan-tekan dengan dia punya button tu semua kan so kita tengok ah like some of it macam all the apa nama dia channel one is it yang all that dub basically that thing lah
ya you know I was you know I was looking at it I think I remember ah when I first like came upon on that that apa channel lah aku macam apa benda sia ni
I think ya oh my god okay even aku rasa even kalau dorang kalau park seo joon cakap dalam bahasa melayu aku pun tak suka
but ya I cannot lah watch that kind of show I just need the original punya
ya but honestly for me also kan kalau tengok um subtitle dengan drama at the same time macam kadang-kadang aku tak suka juga ah sebab you know you wanna
because okay honestly right okay I feel I'm uh is it called visual learner visual visual person I have to ya because kadang-kadang
aku dengar jer kan
kan sama sama
but then but then you know sometimes kalau macam I mean not not um not korean drama also like like anything ah because I also want to see their facial expression their like the way they like macam make faces so is like macam if you keep looking at this subtitle then like and like and like like the drama then macam you skip some parts of the cute cute moment or like the funny funny moment so I'm like
what you mean I tak faham
oh no the the translation the translation is like very macam so formal right the word
yo same ah same even in like maybe cause it's like netflix aku tengok malay drama but with the english subtitle I had to google the meaning even though I understand cause it's malay I have to google the word in english I'm like whoa what are saying translation ni apa dia cakap ni tak faham seh
tapi like kalau kalau apa malay drama pun kadang-kadang dorang guna all the peribahasa ke or like the
like kalau okay singapore nya tak sangat ah singapore nya
oh my god I love anak metropolitan
youths okay ya so oh my god but I love that show though it's like so cool so gerek
ya but if I'm not wrong anak metropolitan actually ada dua dua season kan dua ke tiga season but the one yang dorang tunjuk kat youtube sebab if I'm not wrong sekarang youtube ada then me watch pun ada tapi aku tak tengok ah dulu kan toggle kan I think toggle pun ada ah but like
who actually I don't know who uses me watch or toggle though honestly ah cause like kirakan dorang punya platform I don't think is that is that apa nama dia friendly is it
then kadang-kadang dorang load lama tau like as in like you know macam kalau nak masuk go inside the app then it will like load quite long to actually show you the page show you the ya
ah ya memang memang macam tu because that time aku kat malaysia then aku nak tengok viu tau then aku tak boleh tengok sebab I'm not in singapore
I guess I guess so that's why macam aku tak boleh tengok so I was like geram ah macam shit aku aku ingatkan aku kat malaysia aku boleh tengok so I'm like ah sedihnya tak boleh tengok because because benda tu kan because benda tu kan tak boleh tak boleh uh jumpa mana-mana sangat kan so I was like a bit sad ah gitu lagipun macam I thought holiday holiday pun I still got time to watch apa drama kan
ya so macam sedih ah
I guess it's not really holiday it's not really holiday a holiday ah sebab aku kan kat rumah kan macam eh sorry not kat rumah aku kan kat rumah cousin aku aku ada cousin yang tinggal kat malaysia so I go there ah everytime kalau nak gi malaysia selalu singgah sana so that's why ingatkan dah kat sana dah ada wi-fi semua then I'm like shit
ya bro ya I mean see because of COVID mana kita boleh pergi malaysia dok what the heck
ada ah tapi macam just macam isi minyak pastu like beli makan sekejap pastu balik you know that kind of thing so it's not like you go there and like staycation eh eh sorry
huh oh aku tak pernah dok pakai train uh pergi
kau bedek ah five minutes
siak okay from here to aku faham ah tapi it's from woodlands kan
abeh kau apa kat dalam kereta kau just tengok
kau punya phone
eh then they should start making at dok
ya ya ya memang memang eh kapal terbang kot kau bro aeroplane how slow can the aeroplane go
aku actually pergi tu aku um in my whole entire life aku jarang pergi just for leisure
I get no no no because um kirakan selalu aku kan cousin aku tinggal kat seremban kan so aku selalu gi seremban no seremban is like you know um johor then I think melaka then after that seremban
ya you know okay I tell you the furthest from here that means the furthest um country in malaysia is perlis is perlis so right apa um uh is perlis so perlis is near thailand so it's like aku selalu pergi sana sebab aku ada cousin kat sana juga ah not cousin ah but more of like makcik pakcik yang tinggal kat sana cause uh arwah atuk aku dia punya family semua dekat perlis then after that I go there ah sometimes right so um I got this place ah got the padang besar padang besar is like the big ass shopping area kat kat perlis so when you go there right you literally see the border of thailand
ya ya ya ya ya you can literally you can literally see the gate entry of thailand kat apa padang besar tu tau then aku macam sebab that time aku bila aku pergi ah first time aku pergi padang besar tu kan then aku tengok ah aku macam because I was thinking the I think car lah cause kat sana tak boleh it's too packed to take the uh uh apa bus so um I took the car ah abeh lepas tu aku nampak ah
naik sebab aku pergi dengan my cousins and my pakcik makcik ah so it's like banyak orang kan so kita naik bus jadi dah naik bus tu um dari sana dari from singapore kita naik bus till like till like perlis or till like half way through then kita change another bus to um perlis so from perlis kita dah ada kita punya all the makcik pakcik kan so kita just pinjam kereta ah kita kita gi jalan-jalan kat itu so dah pergi padang besar tu aku first nampak aku macam why is this why is there macam apa like thailand punya wordings eh kat sini eh macam what
ya so I was like so so I tanya ah
is that close bro that's why from singapore actually right we can go straight I don't know whether we can go whether we can actually go by car until england kalau tak salah
ya ya ya so so so that means from thailand then after that kalau kau pergi atas lagi then you will be connected to another country lepas tu kau boleh pergi to another country then kau boleh ya ya ya so until england kalau tak salah yang paling yang paling
yang paling jauh ah yang kau boleh pergi ah
ah motor okay ah sebab motor dua-dua orang jer kan so like
right oh my god so it's like you can actually just kirakan ah what is it called uh
you know I wanted to do backpacking cause like macam why not right
but then it's budget ah you cause dah bikin
but backpacking selalu
itu backpacking nama dia
it's I thought backpacking selalunya ah maybe I don't know what's the meaning
I guess no because I thought backpacking is like apa memang bawa minimal barang abeh lepas itu
gi oh my god walking eh
wow just gila aku tak tahu siapa yang sanggup jalan kaki from here to
tu macam apa tau tu macam dah apa uh berapa ribu tahun lepas
weh oh my god jauh though
ya dok even from here to jurong east aku tak boleh dok
I mean tak boleh lah cuma macam the thing the the
bukan tak kind of macam malas gila ah nak jalan ah
that's why so I'm like what the because you know kan aku dulu sekolah dekat jurong east kan so macam like macam I kadang-kadang kan kalau terlupa bus pass ke apa then macam nak kena balik sekolah
itu pasal lah kau ingat eh apa aku dah penat-penat apa pergi sekolah apa aku dah penat-penat sekolah then aku nak kena jalan balik rumah oh my god that will be like so tiring sia dengan bag sebab dulu bila kecil-kecil selalu um bawa bag berat-berat kan so macam I don't why though huh
no wonder I was like because that time you told us about you were walking at like jurong lake gardens aku macam
aku ingatkan kau actually apa nama dia kau walk just within the
ya ya and like within within jurong lake garden jer tu pasal aku macam okay lah apa-apa yang
jap siapa punya idea ni
science garden science centre ada park kat belakang
actually kau jalan macam jauh jer
but then bila kau jalan kat reservoir macam jauh tau
asal kau pergi jauh-jauh eh sebab dari sini sebab kalau naik bas ah kau dari sini kau boleh apa I mean that is a bit
then why you have to go science centre bagai
for real ah sebab actually from here kalau kau naik bas ah kau boleh naik I think naik bas tiga puluh kat sini abeh kau stop somewhere near taman jurong abeh lepas tu nanti
ya lah ya lah I mean that's why I was like wondering asal sampai science centre sebab from here but
so it's like ya taman jurong so I'm like dari situ then boleh jalan pe that's why I was like science centre asal seh
ye lah semalam kau pergi datang rumah aku kau confident sangat tu blok aku aku macam mana kau eh kau cakap kau dah sampai
ya I mean kau dah berapa tahun kau dah berapa tahun eh kita semua dah berapa tahun obviously we have to be like independent
wah you know I know had like that dream or like that thought of like macam okay so dah nak dekat kiamat kan so like why not I apa pergi apa nama dia orang cakap kan kalau nak kiamat nanti kalau pergi kalau duduk dekat madinah ke makkah ke kau tak kan jumpa dengan dajjal kan so I was like okay yes but then you know what I didn't know the thing about this when uh one thing yang aku tak tahu is that dorang cakap that apa nama dia even even orang yang duduk kat makkah dengan madinah um
no no no you dajjal can never go inside never never because it's really ya it's protected by all the apa malaikat ah so like macam but then the thing is within makkah and madinah there will be a a earthquake or there will be tsunami tau
in in the end of times ah so there will be so uh because of that tsunami or earthquake it will keluarkan orang-orang yang
beriman gitu ah
no no they will they will stay in they will stay in itu so yang yang kirakan yang nak selamatkan diri they will keluar
dorang akan stay inside so that's why yang so that's why I was like thinking abeh kalau macam tu kalau in the end of times kalau aku pergi sana juga then what's the point though sebab because I own self don't know whether I am
the thing is in singapore kau mana ada experience tsunami or earthquake pun kan
ya you know you know that time aku pernah pergi japan dengan sekolah aku pergi sana for school trip lah kan so then lepas itu aku
oh itu pun
ah australia dorang apa afini uh apa eh tak bukan atikah ella dengan alia dorang pergi melbourne so aku pergi japan dengan puteri dengan ifa so aku pergi sana then lepas tu um kan you know japan always earthquake tsunami all that big big apa gitu kan so
ya so kita uh yang aku pergi masa tu aku pergi hiroshima dengan aku pergi osaka
yes history all that so dah pergi sana tu nak kena belajar pasal history kan so dah alang-alang belajar history kita nak kena belajar lah pasal we went to this macam ambulance place eh not ambulance macam fire place gitu to like learn about macam ways to like save yourself from like apa
ya all that so the was this simulation when we did wait actually ah we did a earthquake punya simulation
bro kau tahu sebab dia ada stages tau bila that simulation kan aku pergi we all had to take turns going ah I try ah because they say when you go you have to like protect yourself ah just anything to protect yourself
so aku pergi sana aku macam so there's like different different um
apa ya
ya so it's like uh they all of us if I'm not wrong all of us they give us uh yang medium or towards the high a bit just to rasa rasa kan
it's just the tip of the iceberg ah you think just a bit ah gitu kan
it's not the worst ah it's not the level seven ah it's like level four or five gitu ah dia kasi kita try kan kau tahu aku dekat situ aku bergegar siol it's really it's really like bergegar like macam I can't even like
jap so kalau kita
jap okay so kalau kita tengah earthquake ni kan kita boleh masuk sini tak
tak as in like as in like it's not a good place right sebab benda ni kan
right so like macam
kat bawa jer kan but then jatuh juga so like
tak dorang cakap kan because kalau kau tak ada tempat untuk cover kan
ah kau kau guna anything to cover yourself just to like macam elakkan benda jatuh kat kau
ya ya ya so because kau punya head yang paling important pe dia yang dia yang control everything right
ya so that should be fine already so that's why ah macam apa nama dia um they just say make sure just protect your head with anything and everything that is hard or like macam wooden ke apa ke as long as you protect your head then it should be fine already
ya oh my god that one sedih juga though kalau kau punya kalau kau punya kepala sakit tapi I mean okay tapi kau punya kaki dah
ah and like kalau dah penyek kau confirm nak kena amputate
ah itu itu lama gila
ya so that's why a bit scary ah gitu kan
I think ya it it wasn't a pandemic lah but if I'm not wrong from what we heard is apa kirakan it was a sudden thing right that's why
I think they after awhile they handle it quite well lah like sekarang
singapore actually dapat
it's good that kita kecil ah cause kalau kita kalau kita besar confirm tak boleh control ah sebab
hmm lagi nasib baik kat singapore ada banyak quite a number of uh hospital kan and the hospital is like
ya then every region I think ada quite a number at least at least two ah ya then now cause sekarang they are all starting to built community hospital
if I'm not mistaken community hospital yang all the firstly is all the very minor minor punya sickness ah are like fever all that flu I mean just that small small thing lah
and it's also for people yang from the major hospital transfer to
I mean ng teng fong ada community hospital
ya so that's why so sekarang dorang dah buat community hospital kat sini so I guess if I'm not that time aku pergi
mana eh woodlands ke east side east side or north side aku pergi aku pun nampak they are like trying to built something then it looks like macam community hospital also dari luar ah sebab kadang-kadang kalau kau tengok renovation kan then nanti dorang akan kepung tempat tu kan
so like you can see like all the you know like kalau for houses I don't know if you know ah but for houses kan nanti they will show like pictures of houses ya houses
ya that kind of thing then kalau for hospital they would show hospital punya itu ya so macam from the outside we can
I kind of saw like macam that that thing lah so I was like oh I guess because kalau rumah pun sekarang rumah rumah
I mean is sekarang banyak gila foreigner datang sini seh like banyak gila
actually sekarang
wait so bapa kau masih kat sana
alah sedihnya sorang-sorang
oil abeh kalau kat sini masa itu dia kerja apa
ah tapi kalau oil but he's not really in contact with oil lah right he's just like
I mean baju dia kau dah cuci actually that time kan bapa aku sebab bapa aku kerja airline kan so dia pun nak kena fix fix all the aeroplane punya stuff right
ah ya it's time kerja cause dia cakap dia balik rumah then dia nak kena tukar baju because apa dia terjatuh oil ya then I was like I was like shit apa bau sia ni
it so strong macam toxic
ya but then actually kalau kau pergi I don't for you but for me aku kalau pergi what is it called petrol station aku suka bau dia
low-key tapi aku macam
ya so but then that time apa dia kena kat dia punya baju kan so baju obviously aku rasa dah in contact with the skin gitu ah
ya so it's like dia dah mandi kan then dia dia dia tanya aku ah eh ni bau lagi tak aku bau tangan dia macam asal macam bau lagi eh
then berbual dengan kau lah pasal pasal tadi punya kes
he came with the father because he's below twenty one so you know in a way dia macam bapa dia kena sign the contract lah eh sign the paper ya
dia tak nak dia tak nak buka mulut dia so lepas dia abeh lepas tu bila part doctor nak letak macam ubat err sebal kan dia tak kasi dia tutup jer mulut dia all the way sampai bapa dia marah dia
then lepas itu dia macam then he cried like literally he cried he's already nervous after that her his went down to went up to around hundred hundred over plus hundred forty
tapi bapa dia bapa dia macam marah marah dia but then we kita cakap dengan bapa dia lah actually kalau the like normal person sendiri takut so he have to macam he have to understand lah okay encourage dia yang dia uh this is gonna be a you know macam it's gonna be a it's like something new for him also you know
ah siot kita ada lagi lima puluh lapan minit nak kena berbual

pelik like that but then I watched it then it's damn good
ya so the story is macam a doctor actually it's not a doctor it's okay it's an alien who is who calls himself doctor lah and then ah he finds somebody like some orang from

travel together in like a blue kotak you know a kotak biru and then they will fly through space and time
stuff that is like luar like

satu jam and then I was opening and hooking and unhooking the kasut from the shelf and then the shop owner look at me like huh you want to buy or not
then I legit do that for so long and then I end up tak beli apa-apa then I just left the store
ya I think they look at me like I was about to curi the kasut or something
and then I diri there and I was going to check in lah then my phone semua then I was scanning the safe entry then my safe entry macam lagging so
I tunggu there for like three minutes or something because my internet macam
tak bagus and then you know the ilahui person keep going up to me then they keep saying oh welcome welcome for like two minutes straight then I'm like huh what like

so mama you already you know right that kakak kan suka makan ayam goreng right and then lately kakak macam makan popeyes sebab I think popeyes punya ayam goreng is way nicer than what do you think
popeyes punya ayam is more crunchy eh I think it's like it's not
I don't know but I think it's more crunchy then it's not that oily compared to and then ya the mashed potato popeye punya like lebih sedap
and then compared to punya tak sedap langsung I mean like it's it's it's nice
lagi-lagi like right now melvados is so nearby right so it's really easy to get the the so-called the gingerbread cookies and all the christmas stuff
but then you still have to wear your mask macam susah and then it's also tak fun langsung sebab
that one I searched up they say you can use for dining also in certain places then but the problem right now is that a lot of people macam complain
dia susah to dapat the vouchers sebab ada berapa banyak website you have to go like you have a lot choices to choose then website tu then in the process semua pun macam very sulit and very complicated so
ya and then you can only redeem it I think kalau tak salah first of december
I don't know eh I think so like I saw at kita punya void deck they put the poster everything then they say um start date thirtieth this monday lah thirtieth november until like
very uncomfortable already and very dirty already like you can see the before and after got ya got before is white clean kemas and then the after is yellow very dirty then macam macam asyik lunyai and everything so ya
ya the paint is not the paint I think and the material also because the paint is acrylic paint it's not fabric paint then the material like I told you it's very thin also so I think that's like those two are like the contributing factors to why the mask tak boleh dipakai so ya
but fabric painting the problem is that dia punya paint very faint very thin macam acrylic dia it's very thick right so it's very easy to get the colour everything but fabric paint one is that it's very thin so it's very it's basically water but with err like a bit more macam like you add flour to it right then you add a bit of food colouring like that then secondly fabric paint like if I buy like waste of money like that because I only use it for the mask and then like I won't buy small bottles also like we need to get good quality fabric paint to last mah so that's the problem then it's not like I just want to try then I look at the mask also I feel like wearing so like
very rugi because I don't want it to get dirty so ya
and then it like my room already have so many arts supplies so there's no point for me to buy more arts supplies and then put it there and then when I want to clean it up I have to clean everything up again like you saw last time plastic bag banyak all my stuff so ya I don't know see how lor even if I buy like um the big big bottles now I won't buy all colours I just need certain colours but the problem is you know like I love to use a lot of colours for my paintings so ya
no the problem is right now is that we all have like all these extra activities and everything then we because of coronavirus we all don't know like the timetable then the internship preparation everything so it's all over the place and then COVID doesn't help us also like makes it harder for all of us so tak tahu ah macam mana
no I don't think I can meet you all because I need to finish all my assignments already then kalau tak habis then I will be rushing then susah if I rush because
I think so ah that one also not so sure you have to check with the ustazah again
ya the water sports sounds fun ah but I also don't know because holiday a lot of people but then we got the hundred dollars also I very scared it's very packed so tak tahu macam mana
until june two thousand and twenty is kalau tak salah the expiration date for the hundred dollar voucher
um chop chop type of person ya you know so kena we all nak buat macam cepat-cepat because he also wants to do it very fast because his idea is that if we do fast then dapat rehat cepat so ya
I think you can ask adi if he want to go market with you if he not working because I cannot go I got madrasah tomorrow
I think like a lot I think maybe just like your finger food like nuggets or like hotdog goreng or like fishball like that
the epok-epok also just now err orang sebelah kasih also like very nice also
but the epok-epok like very oily also like it's very crunchy and very garing
I think like the epok-epok when I eat it kind of remind me a bit of the potato one reminded me of of like old chang kee one cause it's like
err taste a bit like it but I feel like this one was more filling and was like more satisfying to eat sebab dia banyak inti and then dia pun macam dia pun macam very crunchy rangup like that
but it was like very little but got flavour lah and then macam very sedap macam rasa macam those ondeh-ondeh cake but the problem was that
altogether it's very sweet and then maybe because I ate the red velvet before that then macam very manis and everything then I cannot tahan also
the apam I ate and
oh then I don't know cause the apam was actually supposed to be one for me and one for adik but I think I know I ate it but I don't know if adik ate it cause he was very full very full after eating the bhatoora
on the kitchen stove I thought that was the apam
and then the the kuah from the bhatoora also still have
but then the chickpea also very oily like when you want to tuang it's on the bhatoora
doing hummus right tiba-tiba ingat macam minum teh turki makan hummus
macam sedap seh
oh ya baklava also very nice baklava with like teh O sedap seh
but I very scared if we go back then later like we have all these expectations then bila dah nak makan then macam rasa dia berbeza cause orang lain yang buat
so ya macam tak tahu ah like
oh I want the shortcake very nice but the thing is the cream they do it like they spread the cream macam tak
ya the whipped cream it's like macam it's not like serasi in that not not not serasi it's like tak equal like that bila dia spread if you see but the strawberries everything very fresh also
I think the satay when you eat it really warm and it was very nice because it's like got the charcoal taste and then got the lemak and then you know the satay punya minyak ah like that right and then you eat with the lontong the bawang timun everything then you cecah in the kuah very sedap and then macam
ya the babat I thought the babat satay I wouldn't like but when I ate it bila masih panas kan sedap gila then macam tapi bila dah sejuk tu macam susah nak makan
I think the I don't know for me was the nasi was nothing special it was like nasi minyak like that
and then like the I think like overall it was really nice ah but the they have the like the sambal not the sambal but like the chilli
chilli oil like that right I expected it to be spicy but not spicy then you eat the green chilli makan dengan green chilli gitu with the nasi macam tak pedas setakat macam crunchy crunchy gitu
but the daging very nice macam makan gitu macam sendiri because it's very easily peel off then macam very sedap
and then macam the minyak right I was thinking if like if kalau kat rumah sendiri right the nasi you put in the minyak then you panaskan you buang you buat macam nasi goreng like that
not a lot of flavour but like just the daging taste with a bit of salt and like chilli like raw chilli makan tepi gitu
but the sad thing is the vegetables dia orang tak kasih banyak sikit jer the lettuce and everything ya
sebab if I have a lot then macam makan pun macam tak segan right then can put and wrap everything nicely
I've been wanting to eat that also like I think maybe buy seaweed and then nasi then we still have a bit of the serunding right
ya I saw then I was like thinking maybe I don't I don't think seaweed and serunding will taste nice so I think macam beli lettuce atau cabbage gitu kan serunding and then buat macam wrap wrap gitu then sambal belacan and then a bit of macam daging ke apa dah tu bawang putih bawang bawang besar gitu letak letak
no eh I don't think so then we also want to do like me and my friends we also very broke already so nak beli barang tu semua but maybe we all like
keluar keluar to cause hari ni is
uh naomi's birthday and then like we all thought macam
uh kita pun terlupa then it's like oh then we just okay lah december we can go out because by then everyone should be free because right now it's exam period for a lot of people
err kailey and ayumi the couple that I tell you about right then I am meeting them so like macam
to cause like dah lama nak jumpa tapi kita punya timetable semua very busy right so nak jumpa and then macam makan sama-sama or something then that time I told you me and ayumi we eat this very nice ice cream at paragon right dia belanja because she got the voucher then we thought of like maybe we go eat the ice cream or what ah see how
no we waited for her to see how if you okay or not then if you are okay then we continue if not need find another person cause we skipped two sessions already and then if this week she cannot then three sessions skipped kena find orang baru ah don't know how see first
bet the person bought lebih sedap daripada you beli because like really like the strawberries and everything are really fresh and then macam
tak was-was also nak makan
so ya then kalau you beli besar pun like knowing you you know like you makan one slice then you can simpan if not you just buy the five hundred grams keep some for yourself like that
chocolate one the chocolate one very nice very like lemak manis everything I never try the mango one but I tried like a bit lah because I also cleaning up right then I tried a bit but not bad also but the chocolate one wah very nice I rugi they never buy the apple flavour
if not then go eat at hajjah maimunah or something sana kan sedap and then like
it's besar so dua orang makan kenyang
if not if not just go out with her go to a cafe and then like belanja her drinks or that one because she usually drink coffee like flat white she doesn't drink like sweet drinks anymore
if not go dessert tea break or you can go like those if you really want like macam treat her very nicely then you can go to those restaurants or
minum teh like that or like TWG got like the two set the two people set
ya so you boleh makan kat situ macam tea break I don't know if you remember but they got this tea break thing where macam dia orang makan ah you pay for two people and then you can eat all the treats you want and the tea you can choose from TWG
uh my friends they they went on a date right then she shared with me they also did the uh tea break thing and then they also eat she say very nice cause it's a lot of floral fruity fruity tea then the tea also dia minum macam sedap
then she say it's actually quite affordable so it's expensive lah but in terms of like the quality and the atmosphere she say was very nice if betul-betul nak lepak-lepak makan-makan catch up with one another
cause like the one that I do my painting right the one that I said like buka the community painting that one they also offer
like tea break session but I think kalau tak salah it's
the desserts all like really nicely macam betul-betul sedap-sedap they got assortments macam like small little kids everything then the tea the atmosphere at the place is also very comfortable
certain places only like I searched up only certain hotels they will accept the voucher and then only certain timings and all so you have to really search up on how to use right cause right now a lot of people complain macam susah nak pakai voucher ni sebab you tak tahu really macam mana nak pakai you tak tahu hotel mana accept hotel mana tak
the ya then macam got a few cafes lah if not also the
like really get quality and atmosphere wise right it's better for you to just go to like bugis or something to lepak and berbual-berbual kat situ because atmosphere pun shiok and then makanan pun actually really not bad and then nowadays bugis area I think got a lot few more cafes and then
that time I makan burger with my friend right then I told you that the atmosphere also not bad
tapi if like that macam susah because from the look of it susah nak travel sebab pasal COVID and then I read up they said that kalau nak travel pun sekarang dah ada banyak measurements like they open borders but you have to go through a lot of things for you to be able to travel overseas
ya the stay home notice right so macam susah like waste of time
but I don't know then the fact that they don't refund the airplane tickets but will only bring to next year but sekarang pun macam end of year pun belum lagi okay everything macam we are still kalau tak salah in phase two
so macam I don't know ah quite susah
I want eat I want to eat the I really want to eat the indonesian bakso sedap seh dengan macam chilli sendiri dengan kicap dia gitu kat tepi-tepi roadside makan-makan gitu
dengan dia orang punya soda gembira everything and then the atmosphere orang-orang rokok everything
I want the murtabak manis
oh ya this whole year takde pasar malam seh
luckily my school has some of the pasar malam food like takoyaki all and then like cantine all have the goreng pisang goreng keledek all so okay lah can still tahan but the you zha kueh burger ramly all wah I really miss keropok lekor
and then the susu honeydew tu semua macam dengan minum macam air-air dia orang air sugar cane dia orang suka seh tu rindu seh
and then drink with mango lassi over there sedap seh that time we drink with the mango lassi woo masam tapi manis
ah ya that time yang deepavali that one that adit left halfway
like you see like I never used before right then I was oh okay then didn't think about it then I was like eh rezeki sebab my face wash also nak dekat habis then I actually wanted to buy my new face wash then I saw got new face wash already I was like okay lah can
but I don't think adik will use because adik very particular about his face
oh ya then the perfume nenek give right the bau right stay for very long eh
one after zohor like one two masih ada bau dia like it's very faint but tapi masih ada bau dia and then nenek punya
the lipstick and bedak muka right I pakai right wah it's like eh very nice because the thing is like bedak muka I wanted to I was like I I I
bedak muka I already because like my foundation I needed something to set and then when she gave it to me I was like okay I can use it and then like I used right and then her lipstick I was like eh like wow okay very nice very like very comfortable lah then I was like okay this is like my nenek
no no no the lipstick colour you know dulu dulu nenek has like old photos of her when she go out right then you know that that signature like
then I looked at it right I was like wah actually my lipstick colour and my nenek punya lipstick colour about the same ah because like
nenek wear lipstick like that so I was like wah okay and then when I wore it and then the bedak muka eh okay
but then I didn't dare to share with my friend because like my friend was like asking can I use then I was like no cannot this one my mum punya
um there's a lot of animes I like to watch I I'm a anime fan lah so Netflix surprisingly dorang macam makin banyak anime dorang masuk-masukkan kan I was like wah quite quite amazed though sebab dulu Netflix there's not much anime
you still hype dia masih ada serious serious because right now um the movie just came out abeh macam
all all of us uh kita pergi tengok movie dia kan
there are some of our friends also dorang masih belum tengok
and also tak salah aku the season two pun belum keluar kalau kau belum
ah kau baru nak start the hype you still ah don't have to wait so long for the season two
but don't I don't know I I feel like you should wait for season two come out sebab tadi aku baru dapat tahu season two possibly dorang akan keluar like
ya Netflix it came out ah slow but it came out came out right april tak salah april twenty twenty that's when the hype betul-betul naik ah sia and apa everytime
like uh there's some macam
apa eh I read cause I think it release per episode or maybe the whole thing at once but because of that ah the popularity really skyrocketed man and and also err dia nya manga because normally mangas like macam for example you know the big three of anime the one piece bleach uh naruto
dorang punya like the amount of copies that they kan
berapa lama eh tak salah aku one piece is nineteen ninety seven out like okay lah this is just a rough gauge all of them ah took like at least ten years plus to reach at least hundred million copies
untuk demon slayer for the manga aje eh
dia wah it's only four years ah
dah hundred and twenty million dah
with drums ah ah tapi pasal kan tu ah japanese kan kita melayu kita kita kompang
masuk masuk rumah kau selamat hari raya eh asal bilik-bilik semua tukar-tukar eh
ya the like what they say ah apa actions speak louder than words
that is exactly how apa gui is ah as a person
ah tapi
dia nya other than the anime
um apa soundtrack dia kan
because one thing about uh anything in general ah kalau kau tengok a show or something kan
it is more emotional kalau dia nya soundtrack is a very macam it's a good it's a good soundtrack it can relate to you like how demon slayer sekarang the one thing people can relate to at first is the song
the by sung by lisa yang the opening
and pasal
that it becomes like everyday object everyday ah actions are sampai they don't know ah they can't determine what is right or wrong anymore but wah it's
for all the animes ah I watch semua ikut yang this dua puluh minit dua puluh minit dua puluh minit tapi ada yang
macam aku rasa like one shot there's this thing called one shot animes dorang usually macam forty plus minutes abeh dah tu jer
dia macam a short a short film ah kirakan but it the sometimes like
orang fikir like oh the longer the anime is the better it will be but some people might not know actually the the quality of how you
tell a story in in a in a film is what matters ah kadang-kadang even like those thirty or ten minute films kan it leaves a very
uh everlasting mark in your in your memory macam tak boleh lupakan it's that good ah like the story storytelling even uh the soundtrack cause come on man ah without soundtrack anything will be boring lah
it's okay man it's okay aku nya A math pun
bila entah eh macam there's this kind of stigma ah whenever you go to school or like university ah in that case
so whenever you go to university you have that certain feeling that macam kau rasa kau rasa bodoh
ah I I shared this with my one of my friends ah dia pun tengah ambil university but I think is like I think ya so ya ah bro that one is just that's just one person lah don't don't let it bring bad image to the school man
especially kalau kau buat coding atau math kan there's definitely
tend to be like some parts where macam oh wait what's going on I don't understand sia and then you have to seek for help from other people it's not it's not the same as like poly atau atau secondary school tau
sebab mak aku english teacher
ya and also macam being an introvert you you have this certain set of skill it's called err from what I learn in psychology like different people have different
like err apa tu there's this thing called intrapersonal skill that's it that is huh
macam apa sia dia ni like asal asal ah kecil hati exactly and like some people might not know like whatever they do right if people don't give them feedback like eh don't don't be so abrupt don't be so macam rude ah kalau dorang tak ada orang cakap gini kan the person who speak all those abrupt words or macam kasar kan dia tak akan rasa apa-apa dia fikir macam oh ni semua ah normal lah takde orang cakap apa-apa [pe] so I'll just continue with what I'm doing ah
adapting and also apa eh what's that word again uh you have to manage your time ya time management is the utmost priority in a university life
abeh kalau your
then kau akan dapat suspension
ah kau ah eh sorry
after one year then kau kena re-enroll
um when you are in a academic warning punya ni ah ya
if you haven't get academic warning then asalkan your is not lesser than two point O or maybe one point eight then you're still save lah
ada is that macam kau nya topic bukan topic apa module module is that module macam
kau nak kena belajar pasal another language
like macam malay atau mandarin
orh is it the same as macam
ada benda kita nak kena reverse the structure of a of a word
kalau english post office abeh melayu pejabat post dia dia dia macam reverse ah it's in that that way ah like buat orang macam confusing
pejabat post
oh like apa dialects ah slang slang
because of that they also update the name of the course to fit in with all the macam
ah baru-baru punya module yang apa nak nak kena ajar like aku rasa for example like
uh in the market I guess one thing yang
macam banyak-banyak tukar is the job finding
kalau let's say err user experience kan
normally macam tak banyak kerja pasal user experience mah because it's not that known to be uh to be like a proper job orang fikir macam alah ni orang lain buat boleh buat pe macam it's another job
on top of the job that orang tengah buat but now it's a good thing that they realise user experience is the most important thing in anything in games in apps in like even in everyday object macam kau pegang cawan
the user experience is for you to hold the cup right abeh kau imagine kalau they handle ada duri tak comfortable and that's the user experience it's a ergonomics err the the design of the cup that makes your experience in holding the cup
even though macam it sounds so simple but it actually helps to make it feel good
macam kau tengah bad mood abeh kau pegang cawan abeh duri kau kau tak rasa
like err happiness like for example kau nak dapat macam aku nak kerja
abeh kau rasa macam eh how am I gonna get to that level so kau kau uh bertungkus-lumus kau uh cari-cari kerja banyak banyak banyak and that process buat kau bad mood
some people dorang dah so into earning money
that their greed is imposed onto them to make more money walaupun dorang banyak duit tapi dorang masih nak lebih
ya they are tuned to that mind mindset macam oh since I have this much money and it gives me a lot of happiness because it can allow me to buy the things that I have wanted since I was a kid
like kau imagine ah like he said in two years eh
cam rezeki akan di diberikan like don't focus always on the rezeki focus on like
what make things work in in the last time ah macam retrospect ah but for now it's more like
which is why I appreciate like all those people yang even though it's just ah comic books or like anime kan it brings certain joy to you like you feel you feel
ah for this anime macam all these one
that's why like ah apa eh ya macam demon slayer like the like what you said the experience then it's the user experience lah the soundtrack visual effects graphics and the characters storyline all that takes into account of the whole topic of user experience
it's happening in in that macam ah alternate universe lah in a way ah ya Marvel cinematic universe
so what I like about Marvel is dorang they apa
dorang suka letak macam orang-orang biasa dalam the movie walaupun that movie ada banyak orang macam superpower kan tapi dorang buatkan character tu macam he goes through everyday life as per normal but uh they somehow macam in a turn of events they stumble upon something which made them into a superhero of some sort even though ada orang dorang tak ada ah superpower tapi a certain grudge or a certain bond towards something yang buatkan kau macam strongly
uh huh game of thrones oh tak eh
tell you about it like macam eh macam orang gemuk like they want to achieve being slim like have that ah that the beach body
and because of that people like the the process is long but people who rarely meet you when they meet you after like a few months something like that then they will say like eh dah kurus eh sia baik [pe] but actually kau kau tak tahu like the process itself buatkan kau nak slim kau belum habis tapi pasal orang cakap macam eh kau dah kurus kan
ya it motivates you even though it's not it's not the like you haven't reach your optimal uh weight your optimal image tapi the
the thought of people macam dorang perasan like kau tengah berubah at least macam you looking more slim or looking more ah toned your body looks so toned then kau you'll feel better and it helps to
tapi it's it's I guess this little happiness macam kalau nak go back to what I said earlier like the little happiness buat kau macam maintain your course cause ada orang let's say pasal yang language one aku pun tengah another language is called C sharp programming language
for this different generations like sejak okay ah this past few hundred years ah there has been certain developments in uh certain parts of uh humanity like last time there's uh agriculture industrial evolution kan then there's uh
I learned this programming it might be useful or it might be very useful for me in the future if aku tengah cari kerja ke atau kalau macam
aku nak keep up to date to certain things jadi macam I'm not
uh losing in the race for finding jobs atau uh skill sets so
aku push myself ah I push myself to learn the programming but sometimes kalau kau buat benda sorang like what I said being an introvert is not a good thing if you want to seek for help
especially if you okay lah probably yang buatkan kau malu is kalau macam kau buat buat buat abeh kau rasa macam eh ni aku takyah tanya orang kau aku assume that walaupun susah but aku I can just Google apa Google is there for me to help boleh search senang-senang takyah kacau orang yang nak buat kerja dorang sendiri
uh the the amid the Google search yang kau buat
so you'd have to nit pick some things properly for it to work kalau tak kan kalau kau ikut jer it will definitely not work
like if they are not happy with the game like your target audience macam budak-budak lima tahun sepuluh tahun kan kalau kau buat game macam five dorang main ke I mean
ya like okay kalau aku ah nak aim for
apa budak-budak yang dorang tak tahu belajar like tiga tahun empat tahun ah not not not not tak tahu belajar I mean tak tahu tak tahu buat math like aku bagi dorang game pasal math tapi ah dia nya macam quizzes aku bagi chemistry
lari kan that's why err that target audience is the most important thing when kau buat game macam untuk kau eh best sia game ni ada chemistry tapi kau tak tahu actually your audience is yang orang yang nak belajar pasal math
like iron man okay ni ni ni betul-betul uh off track
ah ironman like even though he's a millionaire but he's damn smart lah like he might be one of the inspiration where aku will continue programming because
scenario kalau orang betul-betul don't have that drive to make suits to make all these right there is a possible future that we can aim for so aku rasa like programming is a
apa eh
that's why aku really appreciate what elon musk has been doing now
I mean they will have a controlled environment macam uh dia nya apa tu
apa tu ah udara udara dia macam ada dekat dalam this sphere abeh kalau ada ikut macam earth punya udara inside that sphere aku rasa everything should be fine kalau orang kena tanam ke apa there might be a proper grave for them cuma
it's weird lah it it's weird ah cause tak pernah dengar orang ah eh mana kubur kau bukan kau ah mana kubur apa nenek kau ke apa oh dekat mars ah aku nak merawat
naik spaceship but that is a possible future also like kalau let's say when elon musk dia cakap uh human will be planetary existence in in the universe so imagine kalau you have your own spaceship macam kereta sekarang but kau nya spaceship kau imagine macam eh aku nak pergi ah moon jap kau nak makan ah moon burger eh boleh ah kita gi makan sekarang K jap aku ambil spaceship aku
ya abeh kau ah fly ah okay ah ni set ah to moon then dia nya spaceship kau cakap okay uh ten minutes ride okay
abeh kadang-kadang pasal ni sekarang Grab pe so kau call uh space Grab
unless bila mars dah ada a way to like
maybe the thought of that like macam aku tahu aku tak mati so buat apa aku buat kerja ni semua you become complacent
then kau complacent then then there's no progress in life lah macam semua dah convenient untuk kau [pe] or aku boleh ah aku boleh tengok anime hari-hari aku tahu aku takkan mati pe so takyah belajar ah takyah belajar apa takyah mandi cause whatever it is even even though I am smelly or even though how much I don't brush my teeth
makes humanity not to deserve to have a um apa eternal life
but not the things like macam sekarang kau masih hidup abeh kau buat benda macam bagus macam eh dia ni bagus sia okay dah tu jer ah abeh kalau macam for example kalau michael jackson
dia buat buat lagu semua macam okay lah kalau dia tak mati it's still there ah tapi bila he died at at the time when he's still popular
so that makes his popularity increase because macam oh a legend it has it is a legend because
so imagine if like ah the apa eh
the same goes for ni ah the the the football legend
macam eh dia ada buat aku susah but
ya so okay lah takpe lah eh banyak time ah ni tak banyak time sorry
is it yang is it yang reflect journal is it the journal yang
a'ah I can hear you snoring from the hall itu lah it reminds me macam aku punya poly days whenever aku tengok muka kau penat kan like macam it reminds me of my poly
that's why kau akan nampak aku selalu satu malam jer dekat rumah tak buat apa-apa actually aku duduk dalam bilik fikir fikir-fikir benda but then
kau pun nampak ah at end of the day bila aku macam submission aku macam oh chill and happy and everything sebab tak fikir banyak then when is the start the semester start balik lah all the stress and all the macam eh don't disturb me now don't talk to me don't don't whatever don't
eh but kalau aku boleh pull through aku lagi design background I don't have any design background kita madrasah we don't have any art school tak ada D&T art and craft I cannot draw a straight line ke apa-apa but then
okay I cannot draw a circle straight line boleh with a ruler but then still aku manage to pull through ah so macam aku selalu tengok
kau stress kan aku fikir macam ah lah you are left with err one and a half more years you are already in two point two ah so are you excited for three point one chey
huh but you are in a school what kau kat polytechnic semua benda kau task to do you complete what
eh that actually happen to me bila poly uh apa ni bila during internship whereby aku punya internship kan aku design web design dengan digital pin
abeh time tu aku punya task untuk buat it was already aku punya internship was just three months long sebab kita punya panjang abeh
during aku eh three to four months internship so during macam like the first one third of the internship I had to design something for an overseas museum
so aku nak kena design macam dorang punya apa ni interactive punya benda and it's not even a topic that is being touched on dekat poly tak ada pun imagine kau kena buat punya benda
kira macam code tapi untuk punya system orang letak I pad dorang boleh scan abeh kita orang nak kena design that code
and actually at the start of the project it was only me and I had to design for four building pasal museum dia ada four buildings then I had to design all four outer thing so that when visitor datang dorang boleh scan benda tu initially aku kena buat sorang-sorang
then kau internship sama-sama dengan kawan lah ask your friend to internship like sama-sama company like apply together
mana tahu like macam kalau tak kan my company tiga orang apply three people apply me and apa ni kawan aku yang lelaki yang end up dengan sama-sama internship and another aku punya close friend but in the end dorang reject my close friend sebab ada dua intern kat company tu and dorang can only like
hire two interns at that point of time and is a good thing dia ada sebab dia more vocal than aku so macam because
I think it's because it's an environment whereby I'm not comfortable with it's an environment aku tak comfortable jadi macam
aku take a very long time to berbual even dengan aku punya supervisor but luckily but the thing is during aku punya internship kan is not the supervisor my supervisor dia macam assign assign benda jer dia cuma assign aku for one task which is to
it's a mural wall for a company yang dia dah buat cuma bila dia send dekat client client nak kena revise so aku yang revise that file which in the end bila aku submit balik sebelum aku habis internship aku punya supervisor kata aku buat salah abeh by then client dah accept aku punya design so macam hmm pandai-pandai lah kau kau betulkan aku punya file tapi client dah macam eh okay macam gitu tapi during aku punya internship was
aku punya kira macam senior one of kita orang punya senior dia macam higher sikit dari supervisor punya position dia yang apa ni uh overlook aku dengan ni pasal aku ada tiga project afterwards kan so this tiga project was overlook macam dia oversee kita punya design work bukan aku punya supervisor
cuma dia pasal aku punya mural wall
tapi client dah accept so macam aku nak pergi balik tempat tu abeh tengok mural wall tu pasal it's for pasal dorang sewa tempat this company punya one of the room so mural wall dia ada dekat company itu so macam kalau aku tebalkan muka maybe boleh datang tengok tapi jangan pergi atas lah
huh macam mana
dia punya company dia buat apa as in what is the
research pasal
ah but then dia punya nature of the work tak perlukan dia to be in office lain macam like certain
courses ataupun kerja yang macam there was one guy the same area as aku punya internship pasal aku punya office based kan dia punya another group of friend from different course tapi kita orang punya course related to mass communication eh dorang bukan mass comm dorang communication design aku punya interactive media design so dorang punya is like dekat
macam printing factory tau so aku tak tahu whether kalau during that time lah if is like during period
abeh kalau kau macam magazine ke newspaper ke cetak buku sekolah ke
abeh siapa nak jaga machine kat sana
wah rabak seh can't imagine myself if during imagine you
kau ada kawan year one kan
ah lagi especially kita madrasah student kan jadi kita tak pernah exposed to like apa ni people from different races
different ya ke like macam all this while korang berbual kat sekolah berbual melayu jer pe
ah okay lah like during my time is like total culture shock aku kena joget semua
wah like looking back right macam haram sia aku buat semua
ah kau tak regret
ya I remember ya you had a apa ni project during secondary school I scolded you for like macam huh benda macam gini simple pun tak boleh buat ya that is so
pathetic pun ada
actually honestly kan like since aku first kan among kita punya siblings kan so macam aku tak ada kakak or abang to ask things from mummy and is like totally apa ni dorang tak tahu apa-apa and they depend on me kalau tak pun dorang tanya cik shahrul macam mana nak anuh ni semua kan dulu bila aku start pun kau nak tahu apa aku tanya kawan-kawan aku can imagine last time before kita ada internet at home
like I will go to the library my friend yang pandai internet
they will actually accompany me to the library and last time library we can rent hours pakai dia punya internet computer remember so aku pergi sana dorang tolong buatkan aku punya email dorang tolong buatkan aku punya friendster and things like that
yes it was really that bad tak akan aku nak tunjuk and you like what kindergarten lagi pe time tu like time tu I was
okay kau baru primary kan
no it was like primary four primary six ya lah ya so primary four primary six yang kita jalan gi apa ni bedok library no you know when I start reading book secondary one
or ask everytime nak pergi mana then I say or else mummy tanya aku macam kak nak gi mana nak pergi library so last time kalau nak buat research ke apa pergi library ah abeh tu then bila abi beli computer letak dekat bilik that's when slowly but then kita pakai internet untuk buat apa tengok youtube video game
ya so dulu pun macam struggle pun struggle sendiri juga like macam ah yes and that's the ni apa ni
aku by the time kan boleh nampak beza tau so time tu aku ingat masa aku tuition ah aku tuition dengan kak mon kak mon sama umur kan cuma aku first child dia third
so bila kita kat tuition I never felt the difference between me and mon so aku rasa macam kita orang sama merepek sama-sama ketawa sama-sama like we learn together we grew up together like we had silat and everything like that and like on these last few days of the kita orang punya tuition ni the kakak cakap
ah mar anak nombor berapa then I say first then mun berapa oh patut lah nampak beza then I was like huh there is a difference macam dia kata in how I do my work in how responsibility in how I act even though I feel like I act as childish as her macam aku merepek-merepek pun there is still a difference between
tu lah so last time aku struggle ah kau nampak aku macam I had it all like some uh macam senang but actually I had to learn a lot of things by myself like macam mana nak pakai computer macam mana nak buat ni nak buat report macam mana nak buat homework okay of course I had tuitions lah back then but
dapat laptop
itu lah susah kan dulu hidup
and tak macam dulu
macam kau sekarang by then even though when you ask me how to do certain things I would macam huh benda macam gini pun kau tak tahu
but then kau imagine kau and last time it was not as apa ni is not an in thing
it is still new to the whole generation tau so macam memang kena belajar and last time I honestly I was one of the macam lembab
macam everyone have already have email friendster imagine the year aku buat friendster
dah tak popular by then I am not sure if it was facebook oh I think it was facebook facebook atau messenger it was the messenger yang popular
kau tak tahu messenger apa kan
dia macam chatting punya benda
itu pun I only
ya I only ya it's either hotmail ke microsoft so tapi by then aku dah ada messenger terus facebook dah popular so macam bila orang berbual pasal friendster aku macam hmm oh I also had friendster oh nama apa then I was like
if you okay kalau aisha ada time okay lah I know aisha baru masuk poly life kan like primary secondary poly two point two out of these stages of your life which one macam pada kau paling memorable sekali
rabak in what sense
tak ada satu pun jadi monitor ni atas dasar terpaksa pun jadi lah
since but bila first time kau jadi monitress kan was it chosen by the form teacher or also was yes aku tahu aku favourite child favourite student
so sorry imagine if you were in school when we were still in school both me and abang
bila ni which year oh my god okay the cat is out of the bag secondary four it was during secondary four
for what subject for what subject cakap jer lah dah lepas pun
ah class ni tak payah dengar lah
kat ear punya height oh
tak tinggi mana shoulder oh
it's about the thing is we've known each other since primary school because unlike you you are the system whereby after primary six you pilih which madrasah you want to go whether you want to focus academic girl probably but during kak punya time
kita orang tak ada pilihan unless you choose to change school then kita change school kalau tak all the way kita in the same school lah
so time tu bila dah masuk secondary kan bila primary kan kita orang macam
whereby madam rosanna was our form teacher and she taught us everything dia ajar
dia ajar ah english maths and science
so she taught all this three subjects okay so during lessons where everyday kita orang akan mix so someday we just do all english
whereby all of us work together you know one whole class ah like thirty five of us work together madam rosanna being herself a creative teacher she like do art project untuk kita orang semua and that's how we became closer especially during ah like even though there was six main members but behind the scenes like we came back to school during the june holidays
ah during the june holidays lepas itu kita orang apa ni buat artworks for example ah old vases kita orang paint balik to sell during our end kita orang punya tempat yang kita for the competition was at tampines mall you know where dorang have the bazaar sebelah tampines mall
every ramadan they have the bazaar hari raya
no even now yang kalau ada bazaar dekat tampines
yes so that was where we held the competition and everyone came imagine one of aku punya classmate dia kau tahu yang vanguard sheet it's not vanguard is it yang colour colour purple colour blue macam vanguard sheet oh my god it's been so long since I used that word vanguard sheet ah
so dia pakai macam vanguard sheet depan belakang and then dia jual envelope macam untuk envelope macam salam kahwin salam hari raya kita orang fold from wrapping paper and at the end of competition kita orang punya class dapat eh kita orang punya sekolah we first time arabia masuk and kita orang menang dapat fourth position
all thanks to madam rosanna so but she put the most effort lah because we were like only primary four kita berapa years old then ten years old we don't tak tahu banyak benda kan so then after that when kita orang dah bersatu hati bersatu padu primary four bila primary five kita split class
they just tak ada
so last time during my dorang tak ada my time right dorang tak ada macam ah yang pandai
yang paling pandai yang pandai yang perlu bantuan untuk jadi lebih pandai tu tiga kan dorang tak ada split so all of us are in one class so it must have been a struggle for those yang susah juga lah
korang seven levels seh A B C D E F six okay
oh because they want you guys to focus on studies or ah but did you look forward to that camp so tak ada lah kesah sangat
antisocial lah tu so okay back tu aku punya cerita so bila primary five kita split class tau abeh kita orang punya class ground level ground level kan so satu class satu class it all happen when mummy kan dah start jual kan kat situ so aku selalu stay back
so I think there was a kita orang punya senior ke apa tak puas hati dengan some girl from of course lah boy so dorang macam unhappy with the between class five A and five B ah so boyfriend kat five B suka girl kat five A girl kat five A suka lelaki kat five B but lucky for five B they actually stayed back during primary six so girls primary six tak puas hati
so what happen was like one of kita orang punya time find that I always stay back pasal mummy jualan kan kat sekolah kan so aku tunggu lah mummy habis baru balik sama-sama what happen was them knowing that I always stay back you know what they do dorang koyakkan benda dalam class tu
dorang koyakkan benda dalam class tu
ada a few clique until today aku masih ingat pasal that is the same clique
who koyakkan aku punya duty roster bila secondary one
kalau dengar okay so dorang dah koyakkan the duty roster and the next day bila five B datang dorang cakap lah aku yang koyakkan
sebab aku yang stay back
yes and ya ya pasal aku tak hold grudge sangat aku hold grudge yang secondary one punya tapi semua dah besar
so lepas tu then after that after that whole incident
mengamuk ah
tak ah because it was just not me I was with another friend kita orang sama-sama
ah macam tak mungkin aku koyakkan by the time akak balik dia pun balik so all this while kita orang sama-sama but the other class knowing that aku yang selalu stay back tunggu mummy
then dorang ni ah
or maybe bila aku tak ada dekat class I didn't stay at the classroom what I will just stay at the musollah ataupun dekat luar
ah so what happen afterwards was kita orang start to have extra classes after school hours so that's where the whole saga started dorang sembunyikan kasut hilangkan pencil box it's like to the extent one day after school semua orang kena stay back semua dari five A semua dari five B kena stay back aku daripada five A kan dengar
dorang tak tahu tu primary six aku tahu pasal siapa lagi yang stay back tapi pasal dia senior aku tak ada senior lagi nak tolong aku so it happen to the extent that madam rosanna form teacher kita orang bila primary four gather kita orang balik untuk berbual dengan kita orang
then I say you were together last year macam sama-sama apasal bila masuk primary five semua macam gini things like that so in the end kita salam and dah habis ah
tak ada orang nak mengaku sebab tak ada proof
we didn't have any proof that it was primary six but I knew because I know this kakak-kakak stay back
and I knew the history of all this aku kan orang tengah semua benda aku tahu ah yes
ya tapi time rapat dengan dia so ya
tu lah kakak tak suka tu primary five bila but then bila dah masuk secondary kita masih split class sampai secondary one time tu pun sec one a lawan dengan sec one B
pasal kita just annoyed dengan dorang like there was this one trend semua orang akan pakai this jacket do you know my jacket bukan varsity jacket it was before varsity jacket it was like a hoodie jacket yang kau tahu yang grey and another pink
pink dengan blue star aku selalu pakai bila bila it was that trend that kind of jacket and ya backpack kat belakang do you know what aku punya backpack yang colour brown yang boleh clip ya okay it was a trend and there's this one group of girls dorang pakai tu
and I was so annoyed pasal dorang macam flaunt dorang punya because it was in trend and dorang macam flaunt and the whole group nanti ambil gambar and things like that abeh aku annoyed gila seh so aku pun tak suka dorang then comes the teacher day punya time tau so bila tengah teacher day punya time one of aku punya classmate instead of tolong decorate aku punya class
dia pergi kelas sebelah tolong decorate kan kelas sebelah kita orang dah macam oh my god abeh kita orang memang tak puas hati dengan dorang until dorang secondary one
then bila kita orang masuk secondary two kita sama kelas balik
kita orang different class after that bila masuk balik secondary everyone was in the same class secondary two pasal by then pun kita dah pindah dekat toa payoh kan so classroom dah lagi besar so bila yang secondary two tu
kita orang macam ada certain orang kita tak click sebab dia gatal
but other certain students we are okay with them ah by then kita dah quite click then after that bila masuk secondary three end of secondary three kita ada secondary three camp
ah whereby dalam secondary three camp because we have never been in situation whereby kita orang semua sama-sama except kita orang punya macam apa ni tidur kat sekolah bulan ramadan punya time
so other than kita orang semua tak sama-sama actually bila camp itu lah semua orang start rapat
um level one ni kat sekolah mana
I think the only time whereby kita orang tak tidur sekolah so last time kita ada was one week and
apa ni kita orang ada arabic paper and among all the paper of course arabic language paling susah kan so what was ustazah mashallah beterima kasih dia sanggup tidur a day before the paper I think that was thursday kira arabic paper was on friday so dia tidur kat sekolah dengan kita orang so the reason why kita semua tidur kat sekolah was to revise our arabic
and in the end we didn't really revised instead kita of course girls being girls when we are together kita orang ketawa-ketawa and the thing is only girls yang tidur
kat sekolah and there was only one ustaz and another male student to accompany the ustaz lah is the only guy in school ustaz was there to look after us lah tak akan kalau all girls kalau apa-apa jadi kat sekolah apa jadi kan
then after that during kita orang punya ni ada something happen again so kita orang tidur dekat creepy honestly even bila camp bila ada kat situ itu jangan cakap aku buat bodoh and last time tak ada cermin last time there was no mirrors then we bila dah new sikit that is scary lah so last time bila masih tengah kat kita orang semua tengah duduk it was already at eleven plus
mah then kita orang pun dah habis revise because we going to wake up earlier before subuh the next day to like refresh before we keep school because school kat sekolah kan exam dia esok pagi semua student datang balik ah dekat arabiah dekat hall
then lepas tu
no I don't think it was in hall it was in one of the classroom yang tingkat dua hujung sini yang facing parade square I think it was there
lepas tu what happen was we were just talking amongst ourselves and you know the sound whereby kereta jalan then bunyi imagine ustaz muhammad kereta was parked
no he was parked there he was parked way before so tak gerakkan kereta pun semua orang
yang kereta jalan ya
park kereta dekat depan
oh yang sebelah security punya ya
and it couldn't be from the road pasal road dah jauh
so kakak punya the more okay I
tak pernah experience benda-benda seram
sampai orang point out
so meaning ataupun staycation ingat staycation dekat dengan old changi hospital
I know the place is eerie but I don't sense or feel pasal aku tak nak takutkan diri aku sendiri macam kau tahu aku takut tengok cerita hantu kan so macam
aku macam tahu tempat dia very eerie very seram
our chalet time kita ambil yang paling hujung sekali kan tapi aku tak cakap apa-apa cuma bila dah habis the whole thing baru orang cakap kau rasa bila oh it wasn't only me
ah tapi okay tapi itu bukan the most scariest experience aku ada the one imagine ada satu kali tu kita orang ada staycation eh bukan staycation yang chalet dekat pasir ris
pasir ris holiday flat time itu pasir ris holiday flat baru renovate lagi sekali tau they just renewed renovated that's why kita the year before is at changi yang kita ambil
then the following year baru kita buat kat pasir ris pasal dorang dah renovate tempat dia so ah so that time aku pasal aku tak boleh overnight that day kita orang buat barbecue aku tolong the day before
pasal after that day barbecue kan kita balik siang cik shahrul fetch kita orang
so I decided to help a day earlier because kita ambil four days three night so thursday just ambil kunci friday datang petang decorate prepare benda-benda barbecue then saturday the event barbecue some more then saturday is the event sunday is the punya macam retreat pasal tengah ada submission
poly submission so yang tolong cuma lima orang jer akak
kak sumayah dengan lagi tiga kakak ni ah kak jah kak nana kak nisa so kita orang semua tengah bersih-bersih sekali dorang kena beli benda tau
dorang nak kena dorang nak kena beli benda then okay ah tinggal kakak dengan kak maya tengah prepare pasal kak maya in charge of the creation
so aku tolong ah kak maya potong-potong benda tampal-tampal semua untuk batik remember the batik thing yang korang dapat EZ-link
sticker batik ah ah yes yes ah backdrop dia punya backdrop
so nak kena kemas-kemas then after that terus dorang balik so dorang balik dorang letak benda and still nak kena keluar beli benda tau
so then it was three of us sekejap lagi tengah buat kerja thirty minutes ke apa later
terus google punya ni google no it was google ah google ah atau SIRI SIRI ada pakai iphone
don't say anything don't say anything tengah buat kerja
astaghfirullah astaghfirullah then after that terus balik ah imagine balik kul dua belas lebih daripada pasir ris
kau tahu kan the chalet we slept is tengah-tengah laut eh is at hujung depan dia laut pokok-pokok pasir ris park
so like terus kita orang macam hmm that was the
scary experience pasal aku sendiri dengar I myself heard
that thing that beyond that macam aku kadang is it my just my imagination is it something that because from all those ghost story yang aku tengok or was it just me but this one everyone heard and everyone was like macam
okay let's not talk about this anymore so then cepat-cepat ah habiskan dorang yang tidur sana selamat macam gitu
but you don't seem like one aku nak tengok cerita hantu
for telegram ke
classroom yang mana which classroom
keep pointing fingers but no knowing who is the dia punya ni
mengundang kan mengundang
but those one of the stupid things korang buat lepas aku it was polytechnic punya time like it was during it was between kita orang punya from one class to another oh from one consultation to another consultation the session kalau tak salah eh
so macam daripada april to like before the september october september holiday I take a few module then after september october november is so september october november was my internship december came back to school for
then kita orang tengah tengok so from one class to another class is like three hours break pasal kita orang punya class straight so during that three hours we have our own lepak place and only we can enter only my course mates can enter the class ah tap to masuk
pasal lain semua tak boleh masuk so it became our macam hangout room for our course ah
so what happened was the dia punya laptop computer is inside a cupboard so the lecturer needs the key to open up certain things in order for him to play the project plan everything him being him
tak tahu macam mana dia buat terus boleh pakai projector semua so kita have access to main cerita dia macam cupboard dia buka
dia yang buka the whole thing ah so kita buat
tak ada lah dia just pakai macam ruler I don't know how he open I think it was just a macam he needs to put his hand into something to take out the wire that connects from the laptop to the projector so he managed to do that so even when the lecturer pass by dorang pun tak cakap apa-apa so
tak ada apa-apa lah so should be okay so kita tengok movie so like majority of us were in the class tengah tengok movie and
since dia is a glass door dia glass door kita kena orang luar boleh nampak kita but then the glass door dia tutup dengan projector kau faham ah so kita facing projector belakang projector glass door kira orang lalu boleh nampak tengah tengok so like macam some of my classmate dorang tak nak duduk tengok movie dorang nak keluar or lepak with others the mix ah from different courses or just nak pergi lunch so one of aku punya kawan masuk dia cakap eh what you guys are watching you know what we are watching shaun the sheep
seven eh bukan eighteen nineteen eighteen to like the oldest one twenty six umur yang twenty six yang buka cerita shaun the sheep kau faham tak so we were watching shaun the sheep abeh kelakar-kelakar dah ketawa ketawa ketawa after that kita tengok cerita apa tau final destination five
the the contrast between the two movies so the friend yang shaun the sheep keluar dia masuk balik kan kita tengok final destination five dia macam wow you guys ah asal tengok one cerita to the other tapi kita tengok pun ketawa-ketawa but that was one of the best ni lah
and another best thing I yang kita orang pernah buat was
main hide and seek dekat airport
akak punya clique my clique dengan a few guys so time tu kita orang dah habis
I think sebab kita orang habis sekolah siang ke apa ke pasal that day I think that day was
kita orang main terminal two kita orang main terminal two ah kita orang main hide and seek the thing is kita orang tak boleh hide dekat toilet ah pasal boys tak boleh masuk girls toilet girls tak boleh masuk but it was so fun
should play like if you have like a large group of friends to play main hide and seek paling best
ah teman
kau dah dengar cerita aku punya bukan cerita seram kelakar seram ah so during kita orang punya
secondary four secondary five kita pergi malaysia
tak lah no is different tak ada during our time tak ada such thing
so was when the graduating batch went a year before they graduate kita pergi overseas kita pergi malaysia and visit universities to macam kononnya future nak kenal-kenal ah universities luar singapore
so kita orang semua dapat bilik hotel okay lah actually ni cerita seram ah
so kita orang dapat bilik hotel so there are kita orang dibagi like our classes are being divided into three levels so example dia level seven eight nine so level seven semua guys
level nine semua girls
so macam guys punya room this thing is the guys room is sebelah depan girls room sebelah belakang
jauh daripada lift so you have to walk in like macam and my room is one of the last few room for that floor kita orang punya that level kita punya room last few
and kak mun was also on the same floor so kita dua bukan the type yang akan takut because we usually travel go hotel kan so macam benda ni tak akan occur unless before this kita ada dengar orang-orang berbual which
unfortunately they did talk about or all these things that happen in their room lah so time tu kita ada ada macam seminar sekejap atau kat atas kat macam dia punya hall ah so aku dengan kak mun pun terlupa something so kita orang kena rush pergi bilik so kak mun dengan bilik aku sama level ah
so kita masuk terus time tu ada hall and it's a long way tau like macam ah the corridor macam panjang have to pass by around ten rooms
the room dia macam zig zag
so kak mun punya room is around seven aku punya room eleven tak salah
sama floor tak ada dalam bilik tu ada empat orang dua sec five dua sec four dua sec five dua sec four dorang split macam gitu ah
terus aku tengok kak mun tengok each other lari masuk bilik letak benda lari
patah balik all the way
itu the worst experience
tak they dim the whole the very old school punya macam yellow light corridor and the carpet was red
most of the time aku akan pakai
oh ya that's why oh so actually mak aku cakap kan um vanilla extract have gelatin
but kan um mak aku cakap if you want find like vanilla extract atau vanilla essence
kau nak kena make sure dia tak ada gelatin cause most of their product have like gelatin inside
ya that time kau cakap kau nak bakekan aku brownies
so kau sudah bakekan haikal
but we're fine we no we just fight macam sekejap jer lah you know like ten minutes kind
no lah because most of them like I'm cranky but then my cranky is like main-main jer
but yesterday I saw you post about him then kau delete
why apasal kau delete
wait so dah dia ada motor
oh tapi dia rarely pakai motor
um takut tapi lama-lama macam sudah biasa
err spark eh eh sorry aku tak ingat ah dia punya motor semua
no it's either spark atau sniper
mana picnic
um okay maybe not friday since friday hari raya haji kan
okay kejap bila ah okay mostly
next week aku sekolah lah
this week aku tak sekolah next week aku sekolah
but aku tak akan sekolah on the thursday and friday sebab hari raya
ya next week oh eh alamak aku sekolah lah ya allah

aku takut she will stay until hari raya
then kau tahu ah kalau ada nenek aku kan macam a bit
eh can we try like um picnic dekat bonnet

then dia tak update macam okay ada place you know
then you know and then after that dia keluar dengan abang dia
kan banyak orang sia nak tengok like most of kawan aku semua nak tengok then aku macam
tengok ah siapa first come first serve dulu ah tanya aku
but then end up najrah tak update aku then aku macam okay tak apa lah
ada train to busan kat netflix tak
oh my god you should watch your name dekat anime
ya it's damn fun like it's damn sedih like serious like you will cry like legit cry cry
sebab aku tengok dua kali kan dua kali aku nangis tau
huda said it's damn good so I think you should watch ah aku
akan tengok after my english shows so ya I got a lot of shows ah to catch up on
eh fah jap kau cuba bau yang dia orang bagi yang virus shut out itu
you tengok apa bau
mm bau kau nampak yang benda warna biru dekat atas table tadi
oh maybe on top of your table tak ada kot but just now yang table kita ada
kau tahu oh wait
so um kau tahu aku kan
sometimes they okay instead okay sometimes it's like it's either kau buka computer then like
Zoom semua kau akan berbual with your cikgu kan
tapi aku punya kan it's like we talk
apa inner soul kau
okay you kau guess apa aku choose
no oh my god okay correct answer but aku chose orange
aku cakap like since I like sunset then like the
primary colours is orange kan so aku cakap ah like um
aku chose orange sebab it's the primary colors of sunset and
sunset is like represent of me ah macam dia can make my soul like very calming
ya so aku macam okay ah then end up aku dapat five points
I want to be stewardess but then end end up aku pakai hijab so like cannot
kawan aku eh no huda's sister yashira dia
ya tapi dia sudah quit sudah
she oh cause aku cakap dengan dia like aku nak jadi air stewardess
then she said like go ah like try but then aku cakap like
cause I'm using hijab what so it's hard
then dia cakap she have friends that during flight like on air then they open then after bila touchdown they will use back
but for me like complicated like you know macam
macam it's so pelik like ya but I really want sia
ya that's why tapi macam
the thing is kan kalau kau eh
kalau kau on the way kerja that means kau tak pakai tudung
so I think kalau kau sudah fly bangkok or something then
bila kau sudah sampai hotel kau nak keluar balik then kau pakai tudung
so kau imagine kalau like kau punya kawan macam
they say like eh just now like I thought you never like you know like people assume what eh you use tudung you know
like macam back to back
but kau pergi bangkok bila
mm aku
for temperature screener dia dekat bukit batok hospital
so dia orang cakap it's like not flexible but then it's like it's a hospital tapi tak ada aircon
kan pelik dia cakap like note kan dia cakap below like for the note they said um
tak ada aircon so like whoever like shortlisted
so pada aku macam hospital apa tak akan tak ada aircon
I never apply aku just nampak sahaja then aku macam
lah aircon tak ada biar like I don't want like I want I need
that time kan aku dapat okay someone I got
okay not dapat like they replied to me
so aku tanya like hi is this work still available
then kan end up orang itu cakap ya okay still have available
tapi the thing eh it's so annoying like dia orang cakap ada available
then dia orang suruh aku send resume but then they don't reply to it
so aku pergi double text like okay I was being annoying tapi aku need a job
and dia orang sudah cakap aku it's available so aku cakap
um hi excuse me like so is the job still available aku double text tau
err dia cakap hi yes err dia cakap hi yes sorry like still have
then dia tanya aku kalau aku boleh kerja
um dekat heat tak sebab dia macam open space
so the the open space macam kot you know the security guard guard post
aku sudah aku cakap okay ya sure like whatever lah I just need the money
then end up orang itu cakap
so sudah aku sudah cakap yes I'm okay tapi dia mati-mati macam tanya like
are you sure you're okay so aku macam okay whatever
so aku cakap mm
so aku rasa dia annoyed macam bila aku macam tanya like kalau ada aircon ke ada fan then dia tak reply aku sia
tak akan whoever kerja sana macam just mati kan dengan heat dia
eh kau tahu aku tak dapat seh yang that kids club punya
merepek seh
what if what if all of aku punya
month is aku tak hardworking it's just macam nak tak nak

kau excited sebab kau tak payah layan dia
I mean it depends sebab kan
um most of the time is quite lepak
like tengok section kau ah like macam
most of the time like they will only do like macam the important stuff
so kalau
cause zeko brother masuk kan most of the time dia
banyak free time
quite susah lah sebab they have to
but then lama-lama it's quite okay
it's the part yang after itu yang busy gila
he have to think about it lor like you know lagi dia sudah family strict
kau boleh imagine tak kalau ada family strict
then kalau after dia book out dia nak jumpa kau macam mana eh
mak aku finally okay not finally lah
mak aku sudah tahu yang aku sudah patah balik dengan zeko
um okay kau tahu yang the five hundred grant that singapore bagi kita tu
okay so actually kan zeko dapat
but then he have to give back sebab dia
okay itu zeko dia pergi bilang aisha like macam kau tahu macam member seh kau just bilang like about our problems
then after that itu tak apa then zeko sudah bayar like two days after yang dia dapat that notice
then after that kan mak aku cakap dengan aku
um okay cause we were talking about friends lah like aku cakap dengan mak aku
ma like why you like very macam
aku tak tahu like for me and sarah like we realize mak aku macam tutup one eye for aisha
and it's like annoying macam
okay whenever like we balik lambat okay so that time aku balik lambat like aku balik
before one habis aisha like my mum called me a lot of times ah oh yang kau tahu yang
yang aku aku ambil gambar dengan zeko yang kita side by side
ya so that day right my mum dapat tahu my mum called me like around ten

so cakap okay lah then aku text sarah aku cakap
how mama know I went out with zeko then she said
sometimes aku tak bilang apa like aku aku tak bagi nama
so aku macam okay whatever lah aku malas nak fikir
so aku sudah mak aku asyik call like around twelve like macam pukul berapa nak balik pukul berapa nak balik
so after that aku sudah sampai rumah like around twelve fifteen then mak aku asyik call then aku bingit
then aku saat masuk rumah aku cakap ah relax lah like it's only
eh like you said our curfew is one but then kau call aku
pukul dua belas semua like pukul berapa nak balik like it's so annoying then aku balik aku cakap
um yang si aisha mana like dia sudah balik ke belum pergi ah call dia
then after that mak aku macam ya lah nak call dia sekarang
then ah then aku macam okay ah whatever then aku bilang sarah like
ya aku sot but then I think it was like my tone
bila aku balik rumah then because it was so annoying so after that saat um
after like five minutes or ten minutes later aisha balik
then aisha pergi masuk bilik dulu ah so aku kat luar so obviously aisha macam nak gossip gossip
um dia pergi bilang sarah
cakap um pasal mariam ah um mama cakap mariam biadap
itu pasal aku kena balik siang then sarah cakap
err apa yang kau merepek eh like curfew memang pukul satu apa yang kau nak salahkan mariam
which is true ah like apasal kau macam
cakap oh it's mariam fault now I have to go home
padahal just because I was rude like macam kau tahu curfew pukul satu like
kau fikir kau special sangat like you know macam boleh balik like any time
like mak aku tak cakap apa-apa pun mak aku just text dia cakap pukul berapa nak balik then mak aku cakap err adik beradik kau sudah ikut kau
err sudah biadap balik lambat semua then itu pasal aisha nak kena balik
so but then aisha was like blaming me then aku macam like
oh ya then mak aku cakap tak lah like err aisha kan
macam okay so aisha's friend right is like macam
so aisha cakap like um eh mak aku cakap aisha punya kawan
um macam family tak ada family support that kind
so kita macam oh okay lah then mak aku cakap dengan aku err so yam kalau awak nak cari
kawan make sure yang baik-baik semua then after that mak aku cakap
so awak err zeko dia sudah bayar yang duit government
so aku dengan sarah macam tengok each other kita macam
like how you know then kita tanya mak aku ah how mama know
then she said ada lah mama ada spy
so aku sudah sot like I was damn pissed off lah I was like
ya then after that at first aku sudah bilang sarah aku cakap oh zeko kena bayar balik that five hundred
then after that sarah macam oh okay then after that out of nowhere mak aku tahu
then um dia cakap ah confirm aisha bilang
then mak aku cakap tak lah um mama tahu jer gitu like mama dengar so aku macam
uh huh padan muka dia like kan mama punya mulut sudah err masam eh masin
mm ah kan mama punya mulut masin like I already told her to not balik lambat or like
then bila aku sudah keluar semua err aisha texted me she said
err I kena fined blah blah blah then I was like
um huh no lah mama kan ada spy you ask her lah
that you told mama about it then aku cakap um
tak then aku macam aku cakap tak bagus fitnah like anyhow only aku cakap gitu then dia cakap whatever lah
um apasal like mariam nak kena expose aku like
habis sarah pergi reply dia cakap
then after that aisha cakap ah like um like I don't know she was just like saving her own ass
then after that betul pe like story itu is zeko's story tapi apasal kau pergi bilang mama
habis sarah cakap kau fikir mariam nak sit back
err habis like just see like you talking about the boyfriend's name to mama like you know
then aisha say oh gitu then aku macam
like you get what mean macam I'm not saving anyone's ass but it's just that
and and one thing I don't like about aisha kan dia macam
like one time she macam she balik the she said um
apa tu oh she went out to eat with haziq like one of her friends ah yang pernah suka dia
then after dia cakap oh haziq sekarang bawa motor ini ini ini then dia cakap tapi dia nak tukar like kau tahu macam
like mama don't care like who asked like no one asked about like you just tak ada topic and talked about it you know
like pada aku macam huh tak ada orang tak ada orang start topic pun like pasal ini like who asked
then err satu kali oh tadi aku gaduh dengan aisha
tadi I mean through text lah
then the tempat
apa eh
the tempat the kau tahu yang shoelace habis tempat um atas ni kalau
converse kan nanti kalau flip that thingy nanti ada yang the converse punya name kan
ya so she put like that so aku nampak
then okay first dia tak tanya aku permission tau
dia tak tanya aku permission untuk pakai kasut itu like out of nowhere aku nampak kasut aku keluar dari kotak
then after that aku text dia aku cakap one more time if I see my shoes like this
sebab dia punya nike kan she's very protective of it
so aku macam okay like I understand like I won't use it because it's mahal
then after that err dia cakap
err dia cakap I was airing it lah habis dia cakap
dia pergi bilang kat sarah dia cakap why mariam so rude then pada aku macam it's basic what it's kasut birthday aku habis kau pakai macam sesuka hati kau ah
habis after dia cakap dengan aku err okay lah so from now
err you just use your own stuff I use mine like stop bothering me so pada aku macam
the least you can say is sorry what like at least aku jaga barang kau baik-baik habis dia nak cakap dia cakap sarah like
um aku pakai barang dia semua tak minta permission like bag dia kenapa macam aku sudah make it aku sudah minta kau permission it's just that kau macam tak acknowledge it you know
then aku macam ah whatever lah then err dia cakap dengan sarah I want to buy shoes so like
err mariam don't have to like nag then aku macam I won't nag if you don't
then out of no where suddenly the next day dia pakai then ada kotor lagi like do you know how pissed I was like
aku baru cuci like sudah bersih habis like kau pergi pakai
like you have a lot of like expensive shoes like go use lah but then end up kau nak pakai aku punya yang
dua ratus yang kau sudah cakap yang lah aku boleh beli habis pergi lah beli like you know macam it's so annoying like
annoying satu kali itu yang like these few days like we've been like macam
um how to say ah like macam
ya like macam these past few days ah like me and aisha we have like this tension then sarah satu kali
oo I sense tension then aku macam ha lah kau just stop
confirm nanti balik kan dia akan cakap aku err pergi buka beg sekolah aku cause that time I use her bag
but then aku still haven't use her nike shoes so now I'm just trying to find like
she won't ask permission for her macam oh kau tengah tidur kau tengah tidur so like aku sudah tanya sudah
macam what what common sense is that like I don't get it
aku penat sia rant pasal dia
far lah it's quite same but then sarah is just way out of like just terjauh
tapi that time aku pakai kasut
um merry eh kasut apa tu doctor mart
aku just tak boleh fit aku boleh fit but it's so ketat like is it the first time when you use it will be like damn pain or what
cause aku tengok huda pakai sudah macam kasut ke bawah blok tau dia pakai macam just
ya tapi sarah punya is not my size so bila aku pakai it's like extra ketat and like pain
but then kalau aku lose the macam the strap dekat belakang kan then when I walk it's more uncomfortable cause my kaki will ternaik
malas nak go through ah the blister blister
aku punya kasut yang doctor mart yang high cut dulu itu kan tapi dia swee swee jer seh
a'ah macam since
dulu bila aku pakai like okay dia macam
swee swee tapi like there's a little bit of space tapi sekarang sudah swee swee so like
aku cannot use thick socks I have to use like
aku just tak nak like kaki aku blister
berapa banyak doc mart ah kau ada
don't lie sometimes your simple is like aku pakai lepak then end up macam dressed up don't lie don't lie I know you
macam rare occasion
oh if I take one of your high waisted I can use to match my flower baju
the ones that you always use the high waisted yang flair
yang macam boyfriend's jeans but then that one is the high waisted one
ya I think that one can match my baju because
okay I have to bring that baju to you sebab dia kat bawah um tali tau
so kalau aku pakai kan kalau aku pakai like normal jeans kalau aku naikkan tangan aku dia akan ternaik
ya dia bukan skinny dia um flare yang macam boyfriend's jeans kind
ya because that baju since that time seh my mum buy but then I haven't use yet cause I cannot find like the correct
but then kau tahu aku perasan kan like macam
being with someone like so long macam until like they say like
eh baju you boleh nampak dalam kan baju you boleh nampak dalam kan
sekarang bila aku check baju kan aku really see macam
a'ah lah like really can nampak like okay dulu kalau aku nampak macam singlet kan
okay even though aku pakai singlet tapi boleh nampak the singlet punya shape kan
okay dulu aku macam okay whatever like just use it but then sekarang aku macam
no don't want macam aku feel macam no lah orang like kau tahu sun ah kalau sunlight kan nampak obvious kan then aku macam tak apa ah like
boleh nampak sia like um inner aku like singlet like lagi macam memalukan
ni sekarang like he don't even have to say anything about it aku macam automatic sia
tapi sekarang macam kalau aku pakai button then kalau button itu punya macam you know sometimes the button like too
err macam how to say ah like very far from each other so like
can see the dalam kan
sometimes sekarang aku macam even though aku malas nak pakai
like singlet aku akan just pakai err what ah what's that
the sports bra tapi yang sports bra loose so bila aku pakai at least dia tutup yang kat atas
cause one one time kan aku punya button kan dia
dia very far and aku tak perasan then boleh nampak sia kat aku punya dalam
just hal then aku have to change like my hijab
tapi itu nasib tak ada zeko sia kalau tak dia sudah macam cakap ah siapa suruh pakai baju ni
it's true because if you don't have strict parents right like your parents don't care like if you've matair
ya but then kau
the problem is about kau orang kau orang punya time and like macam parents dia pun quite strict
about matair
if tak strict aku rasa most of the time dia sudah ajak kau sudah datang like

different sebab aku pakai for my house right I use cube

but then zeko punya kan kita tak ada cube dekat U star
so kita pakai serbuk yang powder
so aku macam okay ah hopefully it's nice ah then
end up okay lah quite nice it's quite pedas
but okay then aku bilang sarah err kalau aku pakai serbuk
tapi aku tak pakai cube okay tak then dia cakap
kau nak masak kat mana then dia cakap are you cooking at zeko's house then aku macam ya

this macam channel of jobs itu semua and then she didn't reply
then you tak cakap apa-apa
at first I was like senangnya kerjanya like it's easy for like eighteen dollars per hour seh
I am contemplating whether to masuk dikir barat atau like err I don't know if anyone can added like this
itu macam something got to do with like choir the thing tapi it's not really choir but like macam
ya macam nyanyian ada yang menguar I don't know whether I want to nyanyi or not but I don't know where to find barat
like dia macam ah like

uh uh mestinya
I didn't know that ngee ann also got dikir barat
ya ke I don't know I thought was only like
have islam ni ke malay
bagus lah
esok err awak masuk see mostly
you know for the for the person you tak boleh
like honestly honesly speaking I don't mind leaving my parents gitu
mm baloi
your course boleh pergi which uni
but the thing is that like like for example macam hari raya if we cannot go back then a bit sad lah mm
no one in my family have gone to like belajar overseas before so like if I'm the first one to go it's gonna be freaking hectic at the airport
but still right one whole army datang sia confirm dia
can you imagine they everyday confirm everyday mesti kena video call like at least once confirm
but I feel that it's okay if if if the school like provide it feel like a dorm atau apartment like if you if you live in the dorm I think it's okay I think it's ya I think that one can like save a bit of money
but like you know you you have to know how to like behave yourself there are like you cannot be iman kau mesti kuat punya like your your spiritual self must be strong ya
like you me and iffa pergi at the same uni but different course I don't mind though right ya
iffa boleh iffa boleh masak actually
bico boleh buat kerja rumah macam vacuum jer she laju
okay aku tak suka suka baju ah aku tak suka basuh baju
oh jemur kain aku suka cuci baju jemur baju angkat baju suka lipat jer tak suka
pasal right lipat baju kan like I don't know like you have to be station there macam if if for example okay like you say you can tengok youtube and stuff right but I cannot I cannot concentrate kadang-kadang
like a suitable time that I want to lipat baju if like someone asked me to do it right I won't do it like I wouldn't have the mood to do it
oh but if like someone like macam tak suruh and then I just like you know voluntarily do it lah finally
oh you have you read about the news yang pasal yang yang orchard killing tu yang orchard tower well what do you feel about that
I I don't like I don't wanna be like racist ke apa lah but like is the fact like if let's say like kalau um our race yang buat
confirm kena punya kan like lebih rabak but I don't know lah I don't know what was the judge or the court was thinking
just just now I told my like I told my sister lah ya every time I see like the news like cakap pasal
I feel like okay lah like how many is is okay but then it reality actually is like quite serious eh like for example like if I'm in that person shouldn't like macam
like confirm it's a bit like severe pe kan the symptoms and everything and like for me to feel like all takde apa-apa lah like that kind of thing it's like a bit worrying though because I selalu nampak and then like you feel like macam day by day your
feeling towards it macam dah apa-apa jer lah
no I think one of the reason why it was because of the election yang kat sabah
fool ya dia lelaki actually know what to say
ya he said that he said that then I'm like like no even like ah is is not even two week tau and he already said that he dah he he baik already from COVID nineteen I'm like apa seh
no the thing the thing about you is that you still ada kind of like ada income from your small business honestly ya
ya like three more minutes just if I miss up then just aduh aku tak tutup pintu that's why
kalau aku giveaway
to think and then like accessories pun boleh pe
yang biasa-biasa jer lah
err sadly due to the circuit breaker the the zoo closed down jadi terpaksa cari tempat lain lah nak kerja tau err
but err I would say the experience there is err pretty mundane compared to working at the zoo the zoo you meet like a lot of macam tourists
I feel macam the camaraderie is is very ya
true lah I mean then again stung lah so people will want avoid tempat-tempat yang crowded lah ramai orang kan susah apa
oh then you quit lepas tu after that few week
so like macam freshie ah
tak payah lah tak payah
oh they approve of your ni lah
you must be worth it lah you kerja keras for a bit only then you graduate with two majors bro everyone wants you man
true lah true lah there's a lot of ya there's a lot of work lah you want to jaga both double major and your part time job it's too much ah even I will crazy man
ah ya hal ehwal masing-masing lah
are you taking of err joining any macam like the malay atau join silat ke silat
macam banyak of my friends lah yang from my err secondary school
all of us decided to join silat together lah
since uh dah rapat kan and then we understand each other
ya then lebih baik lah better for us lah
ya but macam not really official lah I I had to give up the role kepada yang
my best friend yang I feel that it's more suitable lah cause I busy lah with work
kerja then I need to jaga my nenek and atuk
ah speaking of that err about family kan how how are you err ayah and mama
dia orang okay lah
aiyo dia masih belajar situ lah alamak
so macam like err kirakan dia punya pelajaran is a bit uh staggered behind lah is it
but but the your your brother is a genius lah budak pandai kan so shouldn't be an issue lah for him
ya ya my err yang paling kecil lah she taking O level this year
she seems pretty ready I guess sebab dia macam revise lah at home
she err staying up like lewat malam just to macam she catch up on her revision
err nasihat nasihat yang baik lah orang katakan lah ya
ya as suri teladan lah to her
ya her birthday is coming though so I'm pretty excited to celebrate dia punya hari jadi ya
err bulan depan I think early early early august ya
your dad's birthday is coming also right in two months dua bulan from now
ah boleh celebrate sama sama ah macam gitu ah
cause she's been applying for kerja kerja yang macam full time dekat ah those art companies lah last I heard is the teaching lah
she might err ajar budak secondary school so she went
ya ya she's up sebagai our best lah ya the prestige programme lah in our school you know junior college ya
ya she tried lah so now tunggu result jer lah see what the says if if approve then she gets into lah if not
you need two to three minggu from now
ya I feel super disappointed ah I mean kalau tak I already had plans or to travel around europe lah
and then catch the the swiss alps but macam biasa lah people wouldn't think lor
and ya and err on the bright side also nasib baik lah cause I save a lot of money I mean the money I can use it to beli rumah ke
ya oh ya then ah how's your your dad's ah youtube channel ada masa upload upload videos tak
ya betul
so you expect the baby to appear at eh appear eh they expect for the baby to be born lah in err dalam late november begitu
ya all of us are pretty excited lah kita even macam dah buat a baby shower um eh not baby shower sorry gender reveal ya
so ya I I mean it's just to lighten up everyone punya spirits lah given ya this macam hard
ya and I and my kakak wen is the
anak pertama lah to carry a child for the family
so ya my my mother and my uh brother-in-law punya mother both of them plan out lah the this party for us
so harap harap err it's going to be fun err it's gonna happen I think ah early next month also
ya her mother will masak makanan for us and then after that my mum will plan out dia punya games and
err aktiviti-aktiviti lah yang kita akan buat on that day itself
the government punya pantang larang kan mesti ikut
kita respect respectable lah
eh jangan lah
malu lah
because she can still err go to work lah but her macam orang atas don't want her to come
because he works at the port right so he helps err he is a I think I think he's an engineer then dia tolong macam pasang lah kalau ada any macam equipment yang rosak
so recently he managed to land a proper stable full time job so I I think he macam gembira ah like wow finally he get a job ah
err ah school err apa tu yuran ya yuran sekolah unlike us lah for for
then dia orang tayangkan the whole thing on err facebook live
so they will be like oh ah school of engineering dekat bawah jer nama-nama dia punya students ya in that slow
so in that zoom session dia orang ada buat macam lucky draw lah so you can win prizes ya ya you can get like airpods err jabra elite mostly macam those school technology gadgets lah
ya dia lagi sikit menang seh she said err she said err the one that wins ya it's usually like either dua ke atas dua ke bawah so
I actually ordered err ice cream untuk dia so like
ya then kat rumah I think got no one so uh ya I ordered ice cream for her graduation gift ya then I'm not sure lah cause the number is
ah the number I gave to the company is her number so I mean worst come to worst they will call her lah but they said they don't provide any dry ice so I'm hoping that dia balik sebelum
so mana tahu ah got nasib ah time tujuh then baru hantar
sudah macam one package already
to macam give her I I heard they give her like cremeway alright for her to munch cause of her support for you
aku tahu semua ni ya
that's very nice okay oh it's a chinese girl I I I I forgot I thought it was a I've I've always thought that it will be macam err mixed girl lah
oh really I tak perasan
oh so she's also in our university juga lah
oh she any idea which err kursus she admit in our school
oh wee kim wee is a oh jangan bilang you take double major because of her go wee kim wee
you jangan main-main ni ah
ya pretty surprising eh terkejut I you know
faham lah faham lah
so that macam so far takde macam concrete plans lah with a it's just like you guys
ya lah nanti orang cakap apa kan kalau kita iya lah terlalu excited all then
dude I really want to I really want to but susah lah ni
probably satu dua jam then after that you have to sleep because your work in the next day and
paiseh sangat
jadi kalau awak macam interested kan you can actually join us lah because we just need one more one more person to play the lead guitar we have nadia on the
and then we have err loofy on the keyboard and I'll be paying the drums so we just need someone to fit in the role as pemain guitar lah for us so do you uh interested
uh this is sometime next week dalam hari either jumaat atau sabtu
tengok ah loofy macam mana ah loofy dia memang kadang-kadang suka main-main ah dia macam tak tak serious ya
ya that time dia ni dia dia kerja dekat challenger juga for one day
then after that he I think he fought with his manager that's why he had it lah cause I think the manager kind of bully him also but given he's aggressive nature kan so he macam he quit on the very day also lah
he quit lah I mean ya it they kind of buang him lah he even though he is as as as aggressive as he gets dia punya orang baik sebenarnya
he was the top scorer lah for our class though I don't know ah for A level surprisingly dia punya result didn't reflect
so macam a bit hampa and disappointment
err ya we doing before solat
then after that we pergi solat sama-sama
oh ya ya ya me and loofy kita orang dah apply dah earlier earlier beforehand we apply already
but usually dia punya slot usually cepat ambil lah pasal dia pakcik-pakcik semua dia orang always wants slots right
ah usually the tingkat satu ah closer to the imam
oh no no no no no err now now the wuduk you take from home ah then
ya they they close off the matikan all the air lah
ya tu lah kita orang tak nak banyak interaction lah with other so we keep it at the minimal lah
but who knows you might fist bump juga in the masjid also lah maybe I mean
mm but this is all purely just speculation lah ya bukan betul kan
mm so makan biasa-biasa jer lah like mee rebus dengan mee soto
wow nasi sambal goreng bang dia punya rendang apa
kau kena try bro
tak tak tak sempat because I bangun like just nice at the ninety four minutes mah
then just nice lah so like I terbangun then like oh my god dah pukul lima eh so the next thing I do was I ambil wuduk then I prepare for subuh lah
so ya cik jamal
ya he was lah but he he don't want to macam made me conform to any err beliefs lah
ya it's like he wants me to have the freedom to choose apa team yang I nak support
understandable lah dia orang dekat kan
boleh masuk champions league ya
oh jauh sangat lah
sean jadi millionaire
so any message you want me to hantarkan sampaikan kepada mister havi
I think tiga puluh tahun kan and I think
he's been waiting for this lah dah lama seh he tunggu go their win right
so he really it really bucks him lah when they don't don't win a match or dia orang tak tak uh perform as well as he nak dia orang to perform lah
my as a firefighter ya and kita dulu masuk the station together together
cause you will from the academy also together and we went through our our final exam ya our trainings and when we were posted at the same station we were very happy ah kat yishun situ
the daerah canberra
meanwhile they told us in training is lain what from what you are going experience real life
oh oh so so you so you were like macam patrolman lah gitu ronda-ronda around the area
wah they are not worrying ah like you I mean do you get calls often or macam takde masalah ke in the area
oh err I mean like since you are posted in a the area macam tak ramai orang kan so like aren't you like bored or something cause like do you get a lot of calls in that area
macam tak pressure lah orang tak I don't feel macam orang bully you or anything
ah dia orang macam
hibur-hiburkan lah so like it's successorize the the news man to them especially I mean if you're in there yourself you know how the culture works so
oh lari-lari anak around area
but but usually berapa jauh you run
macam the only only time I ran jauh gitu is back when I was in serving my lah they make us run around ubin
and I think that's the way lah macam orang tak tahu you cannot drink a lot kalau nak minum sikit jer kalau boleh jangan minum at all
uh habis
thirty minutes baru jer minum that that's the ideology that
ah macam
ya it's about biology larh and then oh ada mention yang if you drink more during your exercise you are kind of
ya it it can be that and also you didn't ni lah um ah wash your body
because everybody have their own limit right so kita tak boleh kita tak boleh push too much lah nanti orang cakap kan
but ya berapa banyak juice you suka minum in one day selalu
okay true lah because like for me macam I want to avoid drinking gassy drinks kan macam air air air yang sweet ni semua
boleh mendatangkan kencing manis so
ya so uh at home pun I only got air masak
jadi most of the time the only ah the best alternative would definitely be juices ah
oh no I don't like to buy all these macam manufactured punya cause I feel macam dia tak mendatangkan any
apa tu benefit lah so I selalu beli pergi pasar then I beli dua tiga macam buah-buahan
ah biji biji buah-buahan then I balik I potong I blend
then I letak air then I minum ah
it's right way ya my ni if you if you if you if you got the time my ni always recommend lah when you blend kan you blend dengan dia punya kulit-kulit sekali
ah dengan kulit-kulit dia but the biji the biji you take out
okay lah the kulit err
oh ya ya ya apa dia apa I heard some fruits eh if you don't
do it properly right it might be more harmful than good lah jadi kena macam pandai-pandai lah
ya oh eh grapefruit dengan grape is lain eh tak sama eh
grapefruit dengan grape dia orang tak sama kan dia orang two different fruits ah lain kan
siapa ah yang come out eh nama-nama ni
tu lah
lain eh aiyo
kat rumah that's all
oh so most of the time during the holiday kau kat kerja ah
ah okay okay oh ya lah that time kau bilang kan ah
ya okay lah but still know because of this pandemic right tak banyak orang ah so the you know the lorong right when they all usually like ah lalu right
true lah but tetap masih ada macam budak townees ah
no no no as in like I only started few weeks ago so ya kirakan baru start ah
semangat masih boil ah
ya alhamdulilah dah dah dapat ah
I confirm stress tapi I think it's manageable lah
masing-masing ah
ngam-ngam lah that you all that like dah rapat already
but all this uh all budak history ah
track and field lah but silat
at least ya at least you all know betul-betul joining together ah
oh oh okay okay okay awesome kirakan too much commitment ah
cause you know dia kan belajar kat china kan so when he came back
masih ah but then when he come back
you're like going there physically cause kan medicine kena buat those like physical
ya so now he just lepak kat rumah you know
dia kan ambil kan
you have to do what you have to do ah sebagai you know the abang-abang besar kan
mm ya betul correct correct
what bila ah
bulan oh september ya correct correct
oh that means apply kat
ah kau dah biasa dah buat kan
I mean you did throughout your few years kat the uh
mm mm ya that's good but bila ah bila the results keluar
kalau apa-apa ke apa-apa you just update me ah cause
so so boleh macam you know meet up minum kopi chat chat
ya see but I guess tu kau punya rezeki ah
maybe it's it's better ya kau punya nasib ah better that you've stayed in singapore
cause and then again like the virus situation so belum contain right
oh ya ya ya so have you save up save up for the you know the eventual you punya
oh ya ya ya do it do it do it err I would say it's quite erratic ah dia punya upload like
err cause he has a few differing passions lah kan ah so the initial golf err content that he used to upload right has been on a hub for awhile lah so this sekarang like this past few days he's been you know more interested in collecting airplane models
quite canggih ah for his age
this is the first time kurang experience
ah ya ya ya ya betul betul betul
ya kena ikut dia punya apa
the syarat-syarat
very diligent ah ikut dia punya
err undang-undang ah
dia okay
tu yang penting ah
ya I mean furthermore ours even more mahal lah dia punya apa school the yuran lah so
mmhmm kerja bayar jer uh this ah very efficient ah
slow jer like star wars punya the highlight reel ah
mm dia kan punya
is it held on apa which platform zoom
oh yang the sekolah dah apa sponsor
bro macam mana bro
the thing dah cair ah
but right that means if she's not at home then they won't leave it kat depan pintu ah
ya you know those the standard ones at the floral express where there are they put my macam
ya the standard one ah ya err cukup for that show some appreciation lah
you know sedekah
tu lah it's the standard lah you know how
no lah no no dude that one that one purely my rezeki ah
nasib ah nasib
well I guess communication is key ah yang penting ah so
potential nak kena backfire ah you know this kind of stuff so better to keep it macam tame first
furthermore kalau main also like
so cannot play sampai lambat also kan
tak betul ah ah I know ah
oh apa ni
baik tau
he quit or kena buang
oh but ya I heard back then dia punya temper also quite
but kalau I think
I should be down to jam with you all lah kalau jumaat lepas solat
if you want to go together then kena apply online kan to get the queue
dia orang fast game ah dah apply online
the best seats is tingkat berapa
takde yang rapatkan saf lah
kena expand
the wuduk area now they dia orang taruh apa sanitizer
so then that means salam pun tak boleh ah
orang only the orang atas would know lah all what is set in stone lah
and that one pun mostly kat my
ya so it's the same old kedai kopi and err you know the mall right ya
ya the standard breakfast punya mee rebus mee siam nasi sambal goreng
ah okay okay ya I also thought I thought you would also do that macam dah second nature kan ambil wuduk
oh cik jamal oh I always thought he was
ya all this while right I thought he was like a nottingham forest punya supporter
cause you punya opponent mm
mid table but kalau menang the last two matches then
a bit out of reach ah ya jauh sangat
tu yang quite disappointing ah
um win ah so syabas to them
dua puluh tahun is it ya liverpool won punya premier league
but I will have to say ah dia punya though he quite semangat ah
in supporting liverpool sometimes his tweets will be melampau ah
is he is he still the regular kat your fire station
mm no doubt lah he is really a budak baik lah
biasa ah you know just
ya so a bit sedih ah
where your where you stay your residence ya so ya so I kena posted kat foxtrot division ah tak banyak orang yang tinggal kat this area ah
oh I would say there's a fair share of calls lah there's there's still ongoing back then lah err but I won't say it's as much as the those hot zones like macam woodlands jurong
but no doubt lah there's always calls here and there lah whether their severity macam
ya I I feel the same way ah as as much as like you know the berita dia orang cover and all these cases of
macam mismanagement
I think it's isolated punya cases
cause biasanya macam
tak macam gitu ah usually it's more civilized and laid back ah I would say nothing much going on ah
kan kena stay active kan
ya but I think is tak susah ah tak susah sangat lah but it's
kena biasakan so
mm cause when you when you first start lah like after one ten and then usually you togok air like melampau ah but
ya correct correct correct I that one I fully agree ah kan I mean cause banyak orang banyak orang tak
tak begitu informed lah about this kind of stuff ah so
it is the right way lah is to jangan minum banyak ah you have to conserve
like macam
kena full cool down mode already ah
no it's not it's not cause you drink to little lah it's cause you you minum melampau ah basically
ah that's true lah cause kalau kau minum banyak kan the you're over dependence on water is the thing that will make
kau punya badan is like you know get gets in a shock
uh so the more you biasakan with more water then the more likely you will
kenakan the effects of that heatstroke ah
ni semua kena belajar ah
mm yang tepat ah
oh the biji ah biji
biji-biji kecil ah
the biji take out then you blend the kulit but but then
bila kau minum kan
oh do you blend the kulit ah
but kau kena
kau kena like see first lah whether this the the type of fruit
already has natural sugars ah before kau tambah extra sugar or anything lah when you blend
with the sugar level already dah cukup already
tak payah tambah extra stuff
ah lain
err grapefruit is besar sikit
sama sama ya
ya it's uh pelik sia
ya but kau kena potong ah before you put dalam you punya blender
dia dengan the what's the girl's name ah
dia dengan fy dah berapa lama together
nothing much ah I tadi cause I got sekolah what
so it's just school from home ah sekarang
pay attention sikit sikit
but then cause my fridays free ah so I got nothing to do I thought boleh kerja sambil-sambil
kat sana kerja dah punya lah senang
but then my rest also dorang bayar
but then dorang tak nak ambil cause I still schooling ah then they say like apa ni
aku actually boleh kerja sia
then gitu duit masuk so senang ah but then wasted lah I never think of it lah
dah lama ah tak makan sana because like
diam sudah no ah I mean like
but hijrah barang lama ah now the people there all
faiz faiz lagi extreme no I think faiz is like the epitome of extreme you know
going to the gym person pasal like my friend all say like if I go gym all ah
dorang semua cakap like macam confirm badan pau punya ah
but gym just very intimidating ah like aku rasa macam
seram ah like go there people all tengok-tengok semua
tapi kecil is okay you know kecil cause
but like if you see orang gemuk kan orang gemuk confirm people relate to being obese unhealthy semua pe
I don't know ah later people kat gym tengok like eh try hard pe this guy
forever sia macam gini
at least I looked proportionate ah like don't look so bulat
then these days I want to check already but my parents tak tukar the battery ah for the
no not really after ah after still got a lot of outfields semua pe so we still keluar banyak-banyak
makan banyak ah cause of
then it's cause of ah always order in asyik beli jer then sekali
dah getting rounder ah
the longer you are in army right the more lepak the
rumah ella kat mana eh oh ya ya ya correct correct correct
uh uh rumah ella
kat belakang ah
like from rumah ella you walk to tracks
then there's a coffee shop there ah Fatty Bom Bom kat sana
eh it doesn't make sense leh I mean like okay like kau tahu uh
but then in this case like abang gemuk and Fatty Bom Bom no difference what both halal already what
so like they tukar nama for what sia
that time also ada ah
so like like when I go lia's house senang ah
think like if we Grab like twenty minutes sampai ah
uh kau tahu dunman sec kat mana
ah dekat ah
malas pe dah cakap malas nak exercise
it's like walking distance but it's a walking distance yang jauh it's like
ya but like macam
confirm malas sia nak keluar it's easier for you to just order
but that one tengok ah kalau
if only kalau ada discount ah
uh then then got the then got the telur so it's like more like fried rice like that lah
I never try abang gemuk before ah so cannot say ah
but a bit mahal ah that day I eat it's like six ninety
pasal dorang dorang bagi banyak ah
tak tapi even though the portion worth kan but I feel like it's like two people portion ah
macam the rice you know rice usually they don't give full bowl right do they give full bowl
but over there they give the full bowl ah then the ayam pun dorang bagi dua
I think new ah the shop dulu takde ah
I don't really remember ah because usually dulu kita orang makan sana
always makan the
I play public game like macam
always kena thrashed ah
then aku tunggu kau download warzone sampai sekarang belum download
kental lah
I don't know how come your computer semua games tak boleh sia
like it's more to like main sendiri
like cause dorang ada macam like a energy system like that
then kau boleh buat the stuff you need to do ah
you finish what you need to do already then just tunggu ah
better than runescape ah tapi
like kau kena tunggu ah resin kau fill up baru kau boleh main
console pun ada
ya like I saw on YouTube got the whales ah they spent banyak ah
dude gila like okay the people that whale right they spent the first week the game came out
like empat ribu lima ribu
so it's like really luck based ah tengok ah your luck macam mana
pernah pernah ah ah last time I buy the skin
so macam I bought their equivalent of the battle pass
I think I paid like lima belas eh
wasteful ah spend duit kat game
ada ah additional stats but the additional stats is like what plus eight damage
it it makes a difference but like macam
tak leh nampak sangat ah like you need like
so tak rasa sangat
uh uh kau macam tak you like don't know me like that ah
hmm sejak bila
like kau compare dengan basketball basketball like very fast paced so like
a'ah tapi tapi bola macam
like I book my solat jumaat tak dapat
dah lama sia
tapi tak dapat ah
since the booking start I never I never kena dapat I think cause I always book late ah
so dah semua all the slots dah fill up kan then dah tak boleh
dah tak boleh dapat slot ah
then uh aku tak leh buat for the next five weeks
a'ah so other people can get ah but some more aku selalu tak dapat ah
tak tahu ah
tak nak ah
tengok kerusi all
uh and streamers uh aku tengok mostly streamers pakai the ini ah Secret Lab one
asal mahal sangat sia it's just a chair right
tak ah tapi tapi even though
it's leather you know leather actually murah seh
tak tahu ah
I mean you you said it yourself right like dorang apa similar kan
sama ah
I mean okay warranty dia is apa one for one exchange or what
macam tak masuk akal right like
kau ambil pisau kau potong seh already
okay how about macam kalau air tumpah
air tumpah on the thing
okay but what if it's like kau tumpah kan Coke
that time that time siapa eh tunjuk aku uh I think
achap ah achap tunjuk aku the video
orang pakai Coke
untuk cuci toilet
I've never been a fan of fizzy drinks ah like even time hari raya kan
uh okay usually guest just eh uh tuan rumah dorang selalu just tuang kan
my my nenek punya side more of Coke ah so they got like
then another container is all just uh apa ni F&N
ya hari raya
so if I go my nenek house
it's really just gassy drinks atau teh
like you know Pokka ice lemon tea gitu
apa eh the other one yang ah the hijau one the hijau one sedap ah
tak tapi the best one I think is the Seasons peach tea
Seasons peach tea but susah ah nak cari like everywhere I go like most most kedai tak jual ah
it confirm pernah it's the orange colour one
but sekarang susah nak cari I think they stopped production already ah I haven't I haven't seen it
takde takde takde kerja takde gaji takde gaji takde duit
takde duit takde table tennis
I think no more already confirm dorang dah buang punya like the thing so lup sup you know
macam repeat
then macam
tak ah tapi sekarang not that bad because like
but then eh you got lobang for kerja or not
I don't know ah like I want to do cafe all but like the cafe all semua yang tak halal
aku tak pernah kerja banquet
yang sebelah yang sebelah Hard Rock Cafe
ya cause uh my friend from dulu kerja
uh like the table chair stage semua dorang set up
then usually it's for like reception gitu ah wedding reception kind of thing
ya then after that they just tunggu for the event to finish then they teardown
but dorang punya is more for ini kan is like
like apa ni concerts semua kan
kat Shangri-La that that type
he just delegate the work semua then duduk goyang kaki goyang ah
kerja senang ah tak yah buat banyak sangat ah
oh ya but Marche tak halal lah
eh jangan gini ah
berbual really like proper english punya you know and like
a bit more to the mahal side ah
then dia dapat banyak apa ni
uh banyak freebies semua
but then dia kira balik kan actually what he paid for
but I heard the cakes there good ah the the kuih lapis cake ah
should try ah should try go there makan
can ajak C what
eh eh you tell her first ah eh I'm not gonna pay for you mm bayar sendiri
muka sedih ugh
I I I think nanti aku re-watch ah
I think it's like a company just uh macam get all these people kan
then dorang buat macam a short video macam as a skit
kau imagine macam
macam key and peele
okay ah tapi no matter how many times I re-watch eh
kekek gila ah I will still laugh and laugh and laugh ah
like semalam semalam adik aku main the
key and peele yang mana eh
what apa what's name eh
asal achap tak leh
I thought and him best friend already just now talk on Discord macam
macam brother eh
nanti nanti nanti there he he sniff all our cigarettes sia
tengok ah nanti I play for fun ah
apex apex game dia macam mana
tapi dia punya graphics semua macam cartoon-ish kan
oh uh kira kan macam halo kind of graphic ah
busy dengan sekolah
tapi sekarang five berapa
is now is mahal cause orang resell eh
I don't know ah like semua orang like rebut nak beli P eh actually not ya I don't know I never see the hype of console lah
ada ah main ah
like when I go to my apa ni cousin's house
aku dari dulu kan like
my parents macam
but computer pun my parents let me play like what twenty minutes
dorang like cakap okay uh haris uh
kau main twenty minutes
my father ah my father cakap like eh haris uh okay ah
suddenly like everyone kat uh kat luar then I was like thinking what you doing then they were charging the
so my father cakap dengan the salesperson the salespersons cakap like
eh cik if you want to buy game boy
dah ah tak ah tak yah panggil gemuk pe
the once the slim one come out semua beli ah
I think it's cause it's different lah like you don't really have any console yang kau boleh use touch screen kat bawah tapi still got the tactile buttons
just want to show off features ah ada dual screen kind of
no but Switch still got ada ada animal crossing ada
but quite popular what aku tengok banyak orang sia main
tak pernah ah
oh okay okay faham faham ya
until now I I looking to play it again you know but tak leh jumpa ah it's called what is it called eh uh
total war tak pernah ah
ya apa eh got once got one game quite sick it was on Steam bro yang
korang boleh like form a squad then do like
apa ah nama dia
oh oh is it is it the one yang kau kena kena fix the generators semua
I never see before ah ipin I only see him post punya video ah
for one hero no cause in is as long as you play a hero banyak-banyak kan
so kalau kau nak clamp the ranking kena main banyak ah
ya for other country is by state so like johor macam johor will be
I think north south east west also like cause a lot of players so they need to macam separate semua orang
okay ah for me I find it interesting also but I not so into it sampai
so macam like the
malay heritage semua kan dia tahu ah
the different type of culture semua
quite cool eh actually cause like apparently orang melayu really
they control like the whole trade route semua
now semua
what what you want to makan
kau tengok Guga Foods ah
like with the with the what do you call that the onions semua
eh but guga he got his own ini sia industrial size tempat masak grill
at in his home there's like a restaurant punya size punya grill
no ah I think they slowly ini ah
purchase like I think they see it as macam business purchase gitu
cause dorang beli semua is to promote their channel what in the end
so he memang nak
he buy the good stuff lah like his knife semua bagus punya all like
ah ya ya ya correct correct they buy dia beli the knife from like macam garage sale like that
ah ya the rust out semua
but then yang ini okay ah yang you know those kanjiro kind
uh huh tak kan ah dorang jual
then is dorang jual like legit kira kan like boleh potong orang punya
that one quite ni ah he but that guy keluar kan samurai sword ah
to potong someone
okay ya so macam to start the conversation I aku introduce aku myself first ah
but err my friends my friends call me ash lah pasal nama aku panjang sangat so like ash is the easiest way to remember lah
uh my keluarga all um
to me it's weird lah pasal nama macam bunyi macam nama perempuan but then I'm like comfortable with it because they've been calling it calling me since young lah
so aku tak tak kisah sangat ya so err aku sekarang like uh twenty three years ol
aku baru from uh
ya ya now aku jus
in like various of different jobs lah so aku macam at first like I'm still like looking for my career path lah so I'm just like hovering around looking for as many jobs as as I could possibly find like one of these uh this is one of jobs that uh aku jumpa through like uh telegra

kau went over and ask for apa yang tu err
apa yang kau pergi minta err bidan then dia orang bilang engkau suruh ambil err hairdressing kan
to think balik
you know at least kau sudah
walaupun macam kau think balik now now kau think balik err whatever that kau err going through
before kau tak ada kerja and then kau tengah
kau dapat that skills err future now kau sudah ada that that sudah ada that skill the only thing kau want to progress
but um do you think macam you have gone you think kau sudah pergi quite far juga eh
berapa tahun eh semua kau dah berapa tahun agak-agak kau ah gunting eh
oh semua ini satu tahun saja
oh daripada two thousand and nineteen
tapi kau suka juga ke I mean sekarang ni kau dah come to a point yang macam kau
find it macam dah terlalu err repetitive ah kan
mm habis kalau kau
if you are given a chance untuk um
sound engineer atau gunting rambut
eh the other day kau pergi err airport
dengan anak kau eh semua birthday eh
oh oh she went out dengan your folk your folk ah
kau kau ada ini tak bagi tahu dia yang err aku send regards
I see all good brother pasal ya ya lah I mean budak budak kecil right they

degil which is kan bagus ah ke tak degil degil dia ke tak
ada lah ada that's err it's been quite awhile man
it's been quite awhile geng pasal ya um
err you know lah pasal
COVID you know err I think the last one kita met was probably before
COVID right it was uh kau datang sini um
the recording yang aku nak nak minta kau tolong untuk aku pergi
is there anymore yang kau datang rehearsal is there any rehearsal
mm lama ah about diam tak diam dah
ah dah enam bulan ah
so ya tapi dah oh no dengan ayah tu is probably when uh farhan ah
kita nak work on lagu farhan ya
aku kind of tengah
tak ada tak ada majority things yang come to aku punya err aku punya life
I've now baru start main bicycle err aku baru beli bicycle err a cruiser
err aku just pergi cruising around dengan family aku
err other than that aku rasa aku working on some project macam
aku been doing a lot of err things kat
err nothing fantastic yang aku rasa tengah going on
which is err ah tapi
aku rasa tenang ah macam biasa ah
tenang ah so more more of and more more upcoming projects
yang akan kami you know macam
but paling boring is err tak dapat pergi err seberang tambak ah
itu yang paling boring ah pada aku for the past six months ini
sebab member member yang kat sana semua tengah tunggu aku juga
ah aku suppose I think err I think err dia bukan
ah maybe maybe betul pada kau macam in thing sebab semua orang
but the point is sebab tak ada
tak ada activity yang tak boleh keluar negeri jadi
that is the whole why everybody was into that and the thing is juga
it's the best time untuk nak explore and then kita are much more older right now
I guess it's the exploration yang
it will stop orang kata macam
I mean time sekolah kita kan dulu explore kat bawah block lepas itu pergi jauh-jauh
err main
main tangkap spider at some point of time kan kita orang dah malas buat benda ni because kita nak kerja
so when kita dah kerja probably kita jumpa somebody
err bila mm jumpa kawan
ah nonsense buat nonsense nonsense punya barang then
aku rasa at this point of time pasal kita orang kena
jadi mungkin aku rasa that's the best time untuk um beriadah ah
untuk just do leisure out of
kau punya own comfort zone jadi this is the best time untuk kau come back to kau punya
err youth balik ke
you know where kau kau missing out
ah and aku rasa it's a good good good thing juga with this um
aku rasa kita will tend to macam tahu yang dekat negeri kita itself
ada this tempat ada that tempat ada
then kita pun tahu yang macam okay kita sudah tak tahu apa nak buat right now apart from just makan
kita start to do cycling will start to explore macam
um tempat-tempat yang kita tak pernah pergi before
ah so aku rasa
it's good juga ah
but err kalau kau cakap about that is the the the in thing right now
but not just aku rasa ada orang pun buat not just err cycling tahu
but randomly but now is macam semua orang dah start to macam even
uh explore our own country punya whatever yang ada kat dalam ah not just bab makan jer
ya I mean yang kalau kau cakap pasal longkang it's definitely
at this point of time tak ada lah semua orang nak masuk longkang
tak ada lah semua orang nak masuk longkang tapi
but if there if there are thing macam tu aku rasa there will be possibilities pun pasal
pasal it's not macam something yang apa
something yang err
normal but aku rasa
might never know longkang tu pergi mana sekarang semua orang banyak go on the tahu
macam kira park connector punya
like recently aku just started cycle daripada where aku ah
yes and it was actually pada aku macam
oh and then kau tak kau tak nak explore right macam
so dude during that that that exploration tu
err aku from hougang going to bukit batok um go through macam
and you err you wouldn't you wouldn't realize ya macam
the park connectors are macam really boleh bawa kau macam daripada um
or daripada wherever daripada sini pun daripada
all the way boleh sampai ke clarke quay
clarke quay all the down all the way sampai dekat queenstown
from queenstown keluar pergi dekat buona vista
from buona vista all the way pergi bukit batok how's ah
going from the east side aku tak tahu there are such a thing macam itu tak
ah was it macam dah start dekat uh east area boleh kau realize tak
okay tak
I mean kau kau dah pergi ah juga tu ke ataupun kau
pass by ke kau jogging ke tak ataupun kau nampak jer
oh so sudah sudah kau sudah use that lah dekat
then daripada daripada uh
tampines to bedok ada you think
for now kau dah nampak yang tampines to pasir ris
hougang betul tak baru dia come dia come in right
look at that macam
eh kau err ini hari tak buat apa-apa ke sia
macam apa selalu kau buat on saturday
when you were in your mid twenties gitu
mm dia orang you know they they they they they even like
like now kan macam
go back in time tak
kau tak nak tak suka pergi east coast
kau rasa kau ada kau rasa kau ada penyakit tak with that
tak ah I mean aku cakap dengan kau pasal there are some people who
tak mandi err would would find themselves
it's actually bukan rabak ah punya penyakit it's just that something yang
yang penyakit yang tak familiar ah but you have that you know
huh it's not it's not a bad punya ini lah maksud aku macam kadang-kadang kan macam
ada orang uh tak boleh main dekat
err tak boleh main dekat rumput
ada so itu penyakit
mungkin pada kau it's something yang
macam orang tak familiar macam mungkin pada kau orang rasa kau macam leceh
tapi sebenarnya it's um
bukan pasal tu it's actually memang
it will affect kau punya
mood it will affect kau punya the the the
day yang kau bangun the next day it will affect macam
kau rasa um
ya it's as good as macam kau
might have a macam a feeling yang macam can occur sampai err
tak sedap ah you know tak sedap badan
tak lah tak lah pasal aku aku just wonder lah pasal kadang-kadang kan kenapa aku cakap east coast kan randomly juga pasal kan
err ya lah all this tempat or all this
things yang kita buat ni kan semua macam relate to apa yang aku dengan kau
boleh buat macam east coast was probably buat lagu
cause I guess macam tenang
tapi macam kadang-kadang um tenang but
in the night probably kalau ada kereta
kalau tak ada kereta um
then nak patah balik nak tidur you know macam you know
pagi pagi jer dah sian macam kira sudah pukul
pukul tiga pukul empat atau especially when the
sun is macam really on top of us memang take it will be like macam
ya kau
it was really it was really macam pain lah tapi kalau
kalau ada kenderaan you know um senang sikit kan
macam ataupun macam tak overnight lah you know grab or what not
so ya lah and yang macam
all these benda benda yang macam um
err exploration ini semua kan macam as kita grow
like aku rasa ini semua macam
things yang uh a cycle eh
kita cakap right now is like kau going to almost
err reaching kau punya four digits
ya aku sudah aku sudah forty ya
habis yang yang baru-baru ni semua kira time dekat COVID tu
kau just stay rumah ke ke kau ada cabut juga pergi mana-mana
kau takut tak time yang lockdown
pernah ada kau pernah ada sampai itu mentality tak
meaning macam really semua orang dah sakit and then
um went up to kau punya house ketuk ketuk ketuk ketuk macam zombie eh kita cakap macam
macam that kind ah lepas tu sekali macam
macam eh eh eh eh eh
open ah lepas tu macam eh
boy ah open ah itu macam that kind of thing ah
but this was before yang the first phase was the one yang
tak ada chance untuk keluar pun kan
kan that first few weeks kan at least a month tak keluar kan
so this phase two yang that one month tu
tak kan yang kedai-kedai gunting pun
yes and then ada phase two right
ya so this was macam the first
first few days yang when dia orang announce tak boleh keluar
ah aku was having so much err banyak banyak um
kind of macam err slowly slowly became macam
dalam diam aku did a lot of shopping you know macam
macam online shopping which is aku never that did did that before ah but I really did ah
and then ya it was really macam
like any other day any other day it was just macam two dollar punya shopee
three dollar punya stuff and then every
like every two three days mesti ada barang datang kat rumah aku eh
but ya lah it was really funny that aku err ada that phase ah
because aku rasa tak semua orang tak tahu apa nak buat eh
mm I mean being apa yang engkau nak buat
and then kita orang tak ada that that that that
tanah lapang you know we don't have a big um
kalau kau nak pergi luar to check people out pun macam
aku rasa that that experience was really macam best untuk aku ah
and then because aku pun ada at some point of time
err during that circuit time pun aku hantar
aku punya aku punya senior aku punya dad dekat hospital jadi
aku saw how the street are lonely
phase one is when everybody macam really macam
sudah come back to macam you know
I think yang dah boleh pergi makan dekat luar kedai-kedai dah banyak buka
during err apa err
during err circuit breaker punya time pun I think um
I did walk around lah macam pergi mcdonald's then
come back and walk and then I saw the whole thing ah macam
it was really macam almost to
almost to macam
being in the eighties balik where there is not much people around
but at the same time pun macam lonely juga
because kita pun will be hide inside
you know macam it's okay if you're younger
semua benda boleh boleh change kalau tak betul-betul you can change you punya
crazy also juga kan
so ya lah but still pun
ah the effect and I just macam for the
tak tahu how it will go on lah but I guess
this is one part of our life yang kita jumpa ah you know
it might happen again or it might happen again but lagi more ah
kerja ah it's not no work you know affected
aku rasa it's err more of err
tapi it's not the war of bombing lah gitu
it's macam um
macam um
it's macam
a smooth war ah you know a smooth war that macam
kita tak boleh expect that you know
kita tak boleh expect that but we're going through that you know because everyone macam
tak ada kerja or probably macam
where everyone was really macam
kerja atau tak kerja lah
ah but now is macam
or the environment macam play err err
make them to kind of macam stop from
oh itu lah itu lah um
aku pun macam kira macam wow after all these years err
I I was having a conversation the other day balik pada macam
ah you know macam err you know talking about
music in general macam macam err the whole world right now is err having
or the whole creative punya line in the whole wide world is um
habis aku was just err bagi tahu
err deedee the other day a friend of kau tahu deedee lah kan
so aku bagi tahu deedee about macam you know the rest of the world
um especially macam dekat and what not
dia orang punya creative was kind of macam stopped right now
kita orang was that macam kita orang tak ada industry and kita orang nak kena stop juga
so macam you get what I mean it's like macam um
macam ya lah
but kita orang kind of tak ada industry
pun nak kena stop juga sama macam dia orang
and lagi teruk
ya I mean but what lucky enough juga what if kalau kau dah baru graduate
kau baru graduate last year probably baru nak start kerja dah
you know but now lucky enough macam kau ada time untuk breather you know a bit breather and
you can have time untuk
apa kau nak buat ready untuk next you know
because right now also everything macam kau was talking about
uh all this macam kerja dekat dalam studio
and you know right now everyone was really macam
mm really macam
ya lah tak tak boleh go out for
for in the studio pun kalau tak betul-betul
and even now the studio are all not operating pun
ya it's like the same thing like what happened dekat ini juga
crazy times juga
youtube just used whatever content you know macam
ya semua orang macam
anyhow ah kira macam sembarang ah kira uh it's ya
and even macam sekarang ini macam netflix and there are big big err
but how they going to use all these macam despite of time
you know macam how can they macam selit how can they like you know err
aku I'm very sure there will be there will be light somewhere
it's just that macam
aku rasa don't don't don't give up don't give up for the sake of giving up just because you tak macam
but the thing is take it as if macam there's a new skill yang kau belajar
like also kau kena ingat juga since kau cakap video dah ada
aku rasa you should share it ah you know macam
