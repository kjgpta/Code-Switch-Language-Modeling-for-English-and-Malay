need to choose either sailing or a shipyard job [ah]
so like
so like (um) for me I I pick the shipyard job [ah] because I heard of like very good like (uh) what response from like my seniors say like shipyard is good over sailing [ah] because you know sailing got like a lot of commitment you know like for sailing (uh) <malay>bila kau</malay> sail [kan] (uh) <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>enam</malay> months like that
six month <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] away from your families [lah] which I don't think I personally think I cannot [ah] you know
ya that's why [ah] cannot [ah] you know
for me I don't know [ah] we usually we like homesick [ah] you know so I go
on overseas
but it's definitely something <malay>aku macam</malay> look forward to [ah] like in in the future [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah]
then also <malay>apa</malay> [eh] okay (um) <malay>apa dia</malay> [eh] [oh] okay
(uh) I haven't pick yet [ah] any yet
but like I planning to [ah] so now <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) my first year [kan] [ah] I only got to like try out the different [ah] so like we all can like
<malay>apa</malay> choose [ah] the various types of sports or
club activities [kan] so for my first year as part of a
as part of a module
<malay>kat sekolah</malay> we you can choose [ah] so I for the for me I pick the <malay>apa</malay> floorball [lah] like something new [lah] for me like I never try before [ah]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh)
okay [ah] I find floorball quite interesting [ah] like
quite fun [ah] you know enjoyable your [ah] <malay>kawan kawan</malay> you know quite fun [ah]
but like honestly it's not something I like [ah] as a sport [ah] you know if
<malay>apa</malay> sport I prefer
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> [eh] okay got offer quite a few sport [ah]
you know you got <malay>apa</malay> soccer and basketball got tchoukball <malay>gitu</malay>
but I I don't know [ah] for poly I maybe won't pick like <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
(uh) sports [ah] I will definitely choose something else [ah]
maybe like okay so for they got clubs [ah]
(uh) clubs as in <malay>macam</malay>
okay so you know got different schools right
got like the engineering <malay>dia ada punya</malay> business
then you got my school [lah] called the maritime academy then got the design everything right
so they got their own clubs [ah]
so my one is (uh) club
then <malay>macam</malay>
I was planning to join [ah] in the first year <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) <malay>tak dapat</malay> like you must go for <malay>apa</malay>
(uh) interview [eh] (um) when you first join then they prompt you to join then I apply [kan] then I went for the interview
like I talk <malay>banyak tau</malay>
I like talk a lot for the interview but then I <malay>tak dapat</malay> you know
[ah] that's why then like my friends who like just join then they like very blur blur then they apply they get you know then I like !walao! [eh]
[ah]
ya that's why
but hopefully if I tried apply again <malay>dapat</malay> [ah]
[ah] that's why (mm)
ya ya true [ah] it's okay [lah]
sports
clubs [ah] I think clubs can [ah] but I think you if I not wrong you also can
join other school clubs you know let's say you you can join design school club also
ya legit not joking man
ya can can actually can [ah] so possible
kay
so like for you [kan] Nads</P2>
your school what what course you take [ah] for you I know you are in year one but what course [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
then what are the modules you will like learn
like for your course other than like programming <malay>gitu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) okay
[ah]
for me personally [kan] (uh) I enjoy the <malay>apa</malay> workshop [ah] not for like year one
because I <malay>apa</malay> secondary school I <malay>pilih</malay> [ah] what as my elective I pick D&T okay design and technology [ah]
so like for workshop practice is like something not something new for me [lah] cause I got experience in secondary school [kan]
so like for me is (uh) is fun [lah] cause it's actually something new [ah] some s- some of the what (uh) workshop practice or something you like welding (uh) you got the two types of welding <malay>macam</malay> gas welding <malay>ngan apa</malay>
arc welding [ah] something new [ah] then I <malay>macam lepak lepak</malay> you know
but (err) on workshop cause I workshop [ah] <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> four hours [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah] like four hours of our that one you know and it's a module you know
like for for workshop is is a module and is (uh) about four credit score you know
ya so something easy can like get A [ah] you know
ya it's not bad but like honestly workshop is very fun [ah] for me
really enjoy [ah] cause like you can hang out hang out with my friends you know
then like you can do to do work together
something fun [lah]
ya
ya
then okay for my course right (uh) they got year one for year one to year two they only have like workshop practice you know like they equip you with like (uh) different kind of <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>dia punya</malay> skills [ah]
like we are they like
valve fitting or something all those kind of stuff right
then for year three [ah] is where like the interesting part [lah]
cause no no no before the internship [kan]
(err) <malay>apa</malay> they
it's another workshop but the that workshop right is like <malay>dia macam ada</malay>
what [ah] the ship's engine turbine and like the ship's engine (uh) fuel system you know so like for us (uh) students right before we go for internship right you must understand [ah] all these kind of (uh) machinery how it works
cause if we just go for (uh) what [ah]
if you just go for interview [eh] no sorry my bad but instead of interview <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) internship when you go for internship (err) what without any skill how you gonna progress right know what I mean
ya true so we need to equip ourselves with like some skills [ah] before our internship
[oh] what also [ah]
[oh] ya there's one interesting thing I I learned about from my seniors for year three
okay so they have this (mm)
[eh] they have this like a room a chamber room if I'm not wrong is the
(uh)
(uh) purifier room okay purifier room is <malay>macam</malay> like they do the heating of the main engine all that right so in this room right (err) you are given if I'm not wrong is part of a test [ah] it's like they are given five minutes to fix all the valve properly to the pipes
and also okay when you feed the valves right you must ensure that there is no leakage now
so like (uh) as the water level rises so it's about five minutes [ah] it takes five minutes for a ship to sink so that's an application you know so you must like quickly think fast
if I'm not wrong <malay>kita</malay> will be in groups of five people five people so you have to like maintain the piping system
water piping system and to prevent any leaks as the water level rises cause the okay eventually the water level will rise [lah] but you must prevent it from going up to our like chin area you know so as you are fixing the valve water will start flooding you know you know
so it's like a real life situation if you were to be like on board ship
so you must think fast [ah] ya
ya
ya that's why
that test [ah] honestly I haven't experienced yet [ah] cause I only year two now [ah] but something I look forward to [ah]
but for me because I choose shipyard it doesn't really concern me [ah] cause shipyard job it's not like maintenance of the ship you know shipyard job is mainly <malay>macam</malay> like inspection you know like okay as
as you become a marine engineer engineer in the shipyard industry
ya shore job you can progress to become a surveyor
or (err) what you call the inspector [lah] so they will maintain and check all the valves whether they're in correct order whether they are working properly to prevent like any failures when the ship sails you know
so that's more of like what a profession that
I'm looking forward to like go into [lah] like that [ah] ya
ya hopefully [ah] (mmhmm)
not bad [ah] not bad [ah]
<malay>ape benda</malay> like other things I do other than in school [lah]
kay for me right <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) in my free time I like to game you know
spend a lot of time playing game [ah]
but then like okay okay firstly I start when I game right (uh) I start off with mobile gaming [ah] then I started moving to <malay>apa dia punya</malay> competitive scene [ah]
(oo) #shiok# [ah] I tell you
like because like mobile competitive a lot of people are also going into it
it was like in the early twenty fifteen sec- my secondary school days twenty two [ah] then the prizes <malay>macam</malay> (uh) gift card vouchers so like as a student I I would not want to miss out right
<malay>gitu</malay>
(mm) so something [ah]
something to kill time also [ah] in secondary school you know
then for you [eh] your free time what you normally do [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm) ya true true
then like just now you ask me like for my what got any I join right then for you [eh] cause like you know you are like
(uh) year one right like fresh student right got any plans or not to join any for your poly have or not
legit [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(oo)
(mm)
so okay [ah] based on my experience right
if okay I think you should honestly go for the trials first [ah] cause like all the seniors will be like advocating you to like join a like promoting for you to join right so you go see [lah] which one you enjoy the most
know like okay like you I I personally I know that you will play floor ball in like what primary school or secondary school is it
ya so you obviously <malay>ada</malay> experience [kan]
so maybe you can make it to what (uh) #Temasek# poly (uh) floor ball team [ah] who knows [ah]
ya who knows who knows but I know the floor ball team very competitive [ah]
know
(mm) can [lah] you just you just go for it [ah] <malay>dulu</malay>
see which one you like the most y'know
[oh]
today [ah] I just finished my
last paper you know today
[ah] okay [lah] because like <malay>semalam</malay> I got study like the whole night you know like <malay>macam</malay> two
(uh) got a lot of content you know like one module can have like what eighteen chapters crammed into one one two hour paper
[oh] my goodness legit
so much to study
okay [ah] hopefully hopefully [ah] hopefully hopefully can pass [ah]
but then [ah] after the paper like
at three <malay>gitu</malay> I went for an appointment [ah]
for what [ah]
it's for like
how should I say <malay>macam</malay>
for my
infection [ah] or it's like how to say it's like a pimple [lah] you know in a sense and it bleeds [ah] so I have to go for appointment [ah]
check up first
and I read up ya it it's very painful and very itchy you know
but then I read up [ah] or on this right it's actually called the pilonidal cyst you know
and it's like ya is what very what very contagious you know so it has to be treated then I read up read up then they say <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) it needs to be like a surgery needs to be performed
you know so I immediately have to go down for consultation [ah] so like okay I pick today's date because I thought like <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
(uh) it's a weekday and there will be there won't be a lot people [ah]
but then when I went there [ah] my goodness
like legit a lot of people [ah] I tell you !alamak!

then you're so crammed you know
[oh] my goodness
some reason I thought week day three plus
nobody will be there [what] right but then got a lot of people [ah] should have picked another day
the surgery [ah] okay so like kay just now I went for the appointment right then the doctor right keep
advising on the surgery
like okay [ah]
then then he keep saying like don't do this surgery [ah] cause like I'm only eighteen [kan]
then like it will affect my future [ah]
cause this surgery is it's like
quite risk [ah] quite high risk [ah]
have to like what cut open that [one] put me on anaesthesia
<malay>gitu</malay> then
once they cut open they take out the <malay>apa</malay>
the root right that grows on that pimple right once they take out they cannot stitch it back you know
so they have to ya
(uh) pull a skin
<malay>macam</malay> a skin from like either of like my back right then and cover the wound area after incision is made
so I cannot imagine [ah] [a'ah]
[ah] confirm painful [sia] legit

you know when you're like kay now
you finally in right
then there is like you must start studying right you know do you ever like procrastinate when you want to study
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
for me [ah] I also procrastinate [lah] like you know I prioritize my (err) playing games over doing work [ah] my assignments [ah]
but then again if like <malay>apa dia punya</malay> deadline is like
very close right then I'll start doing [ah]
like I would set a timetable
for me to plan out my time [ah] you know because if
I don't do right then my will be affected <malay>apa</malay>
[kan] like if I submit late then the lecturers will penalize me [what] so I obviously have to start on doing [ah]
but there are some points where like know procrastination like took over [ah] then I miss out some of my tutorial I have to submit
you know but I do blame myself for it [ah] you know
but it's something that I have to you know
tackle [ah] this issue of procrastination cause like
<malay>aku selalu macam</malay>
always [ah] since secondary school [ah]
always prioritise my games over the
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> our school work [ah] ya
(mm) !wah!
damn
ya it is hard [lah] but you know we must [lah] you know
it's very hard [lah] then okay like okay
through I believe that there are like some modules that involves in like group projects or like
prep you to for interviews in the near future have or not for is there like any course <malay>ada tak</malay>
ya group projects like that
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
!wah!
(mm)
(mm)
okay
me [ah] okay I have [ah] okay recently
like for this semester one [kan] (uh) I have this (uh) project called the module name is which is <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh)
social innovation project [ah] (uh) ya
so like (uh) we all <malay>macam</malay> is
I think combined with
(uh) different types of (uh) people from different courses [ah] so like
(uh)
(uh) two from then <malay>macam</malay> two from school of computing and two from school of business then they all mix together
for <malay>apa</malay> (uh)
to do a project together so basically this like
what is trying to do with this type of module is
for you to get used to working with other people of different backgrounds when in the working industry [ah]
so equips you with this kind of skill [lah] but let me tell you something [ah] I do not like working with this kind of people legit I tell you [ah]
cause like (err) it's damn #rabak# I tell you this this kind of this kind of people they all don't want to do work you know they ask me to like
do for me then they keep complaining complaining you know like !walao! [eh] why why got so much workload [ah] [ah] I don't want do [ah] like all these kind of stuff you know then expect me to like do everything for them you know
[ah]
like this
ya
[ah] then okay okay this [one] [ah] it happen like
<malay>macam</malay> a few weeks ago before our final group project so like (uh) it was during (uh) hari raya haji right
then got we all got holiday right for us for us to celebrate right
like the day itself right so we were supposed to do like rehearsal [ah] for our presentation slides
then these guys right
ask me to come at like what in the afternoon you know for me to (uh) help them with something and present then when I tell them <malay>macam</malay> I say I cannot [ah] I like damn busy today I got my
my hari raya hari raya haji I need celebrate [ah]
then
[oh] then they say [eh] why like that we you the only malay just come [lah] then I say how can like that I holiday [what] hari raya haji why can come then they start complaining
then I got damn pissed off you know legit
[oh] my god then I just say I I don't I don't give a shit okay legit I'm I'm not coming then they was like complaining [ah] keep swearing to me I I don't care you know so and also for
since they are from computing school designs right
they should know the different type of <malay>apa</malay>
(err) the type of programs <malay>dia punya</malay> different types of software [ah] to do like animation <malay>ke</malay>
or like do some drawing design [kan]
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] I tell you [ah] these guys [kan] is even the girls <malay>tau</malay>
they <malay>diorang semua</malay> they don't want to do the work they expect the guys to do okay and they expect me to do when I come from engineering you know I have no background knowledge of <malay>apa</malay> different type of drawing you know
[ah] !alamak! legit I tell you I don't want [ah] but it's okay [lah]
ya but overall I think it's a good experience [lah]
cause in the end after like a few prompts right
for them to like cooperate together we all then managed to work together [ah]
and also ya it's good [lah] so for our project it's quite interesting you know our project
we made (uh) okay you know for our project our aim right
is to help people with depression you know so like <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) we have to come up with an app we decided to come up with an app
to help people with depression integrate back into society
you know
integrate back into society means like okay if usually if what comes to mind when you think of depression people
like they are like very lonely [kan]
[ah] they are like damn lonely right
!alamak! why like this right then so our plan right for our app right is for them to interact
more with <malay>macam</malay> (err) people [ah] online people online [ah] like strangers you know not in not strangers [lah]
but like people who also suffer from depression for them to make friends it's like a connection hub you know
for people of them their type
and also for our app
because since like a lot of teens just nowadays use mobile phone right always twenty four seven they always use [ah] then we decided to come up with something interesting for them [lah] cause why what what will pull them to download the app right
our
(uh) our the depression app [ah] counter
so we decided to put in like some cute cute thing [ah] like <malay>apa</malay> the <malay>apa</malay> the
Pikachu [ah] Pokemon Go you know or not Pokemon Go concept ya
ya
then our app also <malay>ada</malay> you have (err) what [ah] you have the therapy consultation tab
kay so what's so special about this tab right
(uh) when kay it's for the user right the the the people with depression right when they use the app [kan] they can (uh) what [ah] (uh)
in a talk to like virtual you know virtual controls right so when they talk then they type right say (uh) how are you today then it'll automatically like reply back with something positive you know
ya
(mm) it's it's quite cool [lah] honestly
and also (err)
you can also prompt for
(uh) real life consultants online you know so you want to like one on one (uh) what (uh) questions you want counselling one on one can you know through the app s+which is what I find quite cool [lah] ya
ya (um) and also for our app right (uh) we also put what [ah]
(uh) since like most of us like like to game [ah] like we
most (um) people like to game like they download apps for what
(uh) games right
for most people right then
[ah] our app introduces like some mini short games [ah] so you got heard of (uh) what kind of games [ah] (err) like Fun Run have you heard of Fun Run
[ah] Fun Run like the that one
the run what I say
some mini games [ah] like also we put (uh) animal crossing [ah] concept into the games
so there's like a variety of
(um)
games for the user to play with [ah] which makes our app interesting [ah]
ya a lot of people [ah]
(mm)
ya so our app
since our app is based on (uh) like I said the <malay>apa</malay> [eh] the <malay>macam</malay> Pokemon [kan] like the virtual pet right
so we have introduced like
a
a kind of system where
when you log into the app every day
it you you will get like virtual currency or coins [ah] basically like everyday you log in to the app you get five coins so what what can the coins do so our team decided to <malay>macam</malay> what I decide to do [ah]
with the coins right we can use it to feed our virtual pet you know
so like the shop right we also have a shop [ah] the app also have a shop so it's the shop right we put (err) like the what [ah] poke food poke food includes like the <malay>apa</malay>
[ah]
what ramen or some like cookie [eh]
for you to feed your virtual pet then every time you feed your virtual pet it becomes more chonky you know
ya it becomes fatter and fatter and also with coins you can unlock like new different type of Pokemon [ah] which is I think quite cool [ah] so our ya it's quite interesting then it will drive
more people to download this app so I think it's like something like
people
will look forward to [ah] ya
forward to ya
so that's about it [ah] for my module interesting [ah]
(mmhmm)
ya ya
also got one more got one more if I'm not wrong (uh)
it was not this year it was last year last year's
semester two [ah]
ya semester two [ah]
it's called (err)
[ah] communicative I can't remember [ah] what is it but the main purpose of the module right it was to equip us students right to
<malay>macam</malay>
(uh) improve our skills you know improve our skills and also improve our interview skills
through this module
so basically got a few skills that they teach [ah] like one of them is [ah] time management skill right
so they give us like a timetable a timeline for us to complete different things then he our our lecturer teaches us the importance [ah] it's like more of educating these kind of skill why is it important in the future
when you go into the working industry you know cause without time management how can you do your job right [kan] do your job properly and efficiently
ya
and also what [ah]
what's that [ah]
[oh] your interview skills [ah]

<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia suka</malay> [ah] <malay>dia suka</malay>
(hmm)
some more <malay>mak dia tak nak bayarkan</malay> he have to pay himself
if your parents pay for you then okay [ah] if not because he say like quite quite ex
okay
okay let's say if your is actually good would you go for do you think you want to go for poly [eh] poly uni
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh yang</malay> she study and she's good at it also it's good [lah] because like if you have uni you have uni like you have a degree then after that you will have higher pay enter only will have higher pay if not you're let's say if you enter with a diploma then your <malay>gaji</malay> is two point five then if you enter with a degree your <malay>gaji</malay> is three point five something like that
ya if not if you enter with a diploma and then you have to slowly work up you know <malay>macam</malay> two point five <malay>abeh</malay> maybe after two years later your boss <malay>naikkan gaji</malay> two point seven two point eight I don't know
no [ah] it's considered but for a start it's considered a lot
but for
my for like my course is not a lot my course (uh) starting for diploma is three point two
ya that's why it's so damn hard
yes
so is <malay>kalau</malay> I just stop at diploma I can make like three point two [ah] if I go for a hospital
that's considered a lot [ah] like start then plus bonus or plus incentive
like minimum five K
ya if you want a normal normal life like you want a house you want a car then five K I think it's the bare minimum
total
okay [lah] enough [what]
no five K one person
but that's not bad [what] you see your house also like like bigger than my house then your father can afford a car so okay [ah]
so they add up together <malay>dah</malay> seven K seven K is enough
<malay>bagus</malay> [ah]
but like I think for comfortable life <malay>macam betul-betul</malay> comfortable you don't need to think about financial issues right minimum five K I think
I think something right starting another business [sia]
(uh) no it's the same (uh) like food but then another another shop so like she <malay>buka</malay> same shop
<malay>mana</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tahu</malay> [kan]
like I tried [lah] like my mum own cooking at home <malay>sedap</malay> [ah] <malay>takkan aku nak cakap mak aku masak tak sedap</malay>
ya then she learn she learn from like internet facebook all this I don't for she interested in this kind of thing [eh] like kitchen I am not at all then she ask me to help <malay>aku macam</malay> I don't like [lah] this kind of thing then after that she ask my sister <malay>itu semua untuk buka</malay> this kind of shop
ya you know <malay>yang kedai yang</malay> <malay>ni</malay> she actually wanted to
[oh] ya you actually wanted to <malay>tutup</malay> the shop and open because she want to open another shop but then end up she think back <malay>pasal</malay> her her work workers <malay>macam tak bagus</malay> her workers like take advantage like she pay her worker like seventy dollars per day
like six [eh] seven to three [jer]
so it's not like very long hours
<malay>otak kau</malay>
there you don't need a waitress you know you just takeaway you take the food and go
ya it's just like that I mean <malay>dia punya pekerja</malay> like the food standard is always <malay>macam tak</malay> constant <malay>sekejap sedap sekejap tak sedap</malay> that kind
who
my mother after she pay everything right and you know that stall
is four K you know
my mum pay monthly four K <malay>orang semua terkejut</malay> [sia]
<malay>dorang macam</malay> how you make money here then <malay>mak aku macam</malay> (uh) cause my mum she smart [lah] in business she smart in business she just put everything <malay>macam orang nak taruk barang tu semua</malay> [kan] then they just tell people then she just put on her <malay>barang</malay>
so she just take everything and just put <malay>macam</malay> no matter <malay>benda tu orang nak ke tak</malay> just put [lah] like <malay>kalau orang nak beli</malay>
ya then she can earn herself like that one shop like minimum three K
ya then like
<malay>tapi</malay> because the shop is too expensive per four K per month then I tell my mum <malay>takyah</malay> [lah] <malay>tutup</malay> [ah] <malay>kedai ni mahal</malay> [sia]
like if let's say if you find another shop like one K plus then that three K can be yours then can add up to your three K can be six K already you earn then this [one] you pay four K to them just like that I mean bill <malay>kena bayar sendiri</malay>
<malay>bil api air semua kena bayar sendiri</malay> then aircon <malay>dalam tu macam rosak gitu</malay> so cannot feel
ya (uh) <malay>tak dia</malay> repair but you know the thing is <malay>kita tak ada</malay> aircon [ah] the aircon <malay>macam tak boleh rasa</malay> then <malay>abeh</malay> you have still have to pay for the aircon shit
<malay>pastu</malay> engine <malay>dia</malay> keep trip [ah] <malay>macam dia punya mak aku</malay> my mum say can only open like two switches at a time <malay>abeh macam mana nak masak cepat-cepat</malay> like two switch at a time <malay>kalau nak panaskan</malay> it's like very <malay>lambat</malay> [kan]
<malay>abeh lepas tu</malay> then they they thing keep trip the whole thing just trip [kan] <malay>tak ada lampu</malay> for like thirty minutes <malay>tak ada lampu</malay> [tau] then the person will scold us say I tell already right you can open two two switch
but
what the hell two switch <malay>abeh dah</malay> [lah] <malay>mahal abeh kau cakap buka</malay> two switch
<malay>merepek</malay> [kan] then <malay>mak aku dah aku cakap dengan mak aku tutup</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>kedai ni</malay> then after that my mum <malay>macam sedih</malay> [ah] to leave the <malay>kedai</malay> [seh] like like the <malay>kedai</malay> then after that my dad already <malay>dah tukarkan</malay> the wire the whole wire because you know last time can open two switch now my dad <malay>dah tukar</malay> we can open all the switch already then it won't trip <malay>bapa aku cakap</malay> they use the wire <malay>yang</malay> lousy the wire like literally the cheapest wire
ya that's why <malay>kau buka tu</malay> switch [jer] <malay>dah</malay> trip
exactly <malay>abeh lepas tu bapa bapa aku yang buat</malay> [sia] <malay>semua yang</malay> the whole wire then he do by himself then like you know my mum already put in a lot [lah] for that shop <malay>abeh dia sedih nak tutup</malay> the shop then after that when we ask her to <malay>tutup</malay> she like <malay>tak nak</malay> [ah] then she say you know what if I continue to just open the shop then at least she say monthly she can still get three K [what] she open another shop then she can earn more [what] because she's interested you know this food food shit [ah] <malay>aku tak aku tak</malay> interested
earn a lot but you say the expansion though she cannot wait for one shop she open
<malay>jom</malay> [ah] <malay>kita buka sama-sama kau masak aku</malay>
right right <malay>kalau kita buka</malay> together then you can cook then I will be the server
<malay>kita</malay> how about we do western food and not
fusion
malay <malay>nasi</malay>
<malay>kita taruk mi rebus</malay> plus fish and chips
!eww!
[eh] actually can try [sia] if it's nice
or like put like chilli crab <malay>punya</malay> sauce right
or we put (um) <malay>kuah mi soto</malay>
ya I can see you your love for <malay>soto ayam</malay>
at where
[oh] really
that <malay>soto ayam</malay>
!wow!
<malay>murah</malay> [seh]
one day I should try also maybe we should go
I
malay food I like you know <malay>yang nasi rawan</malay> but that was so that is so good (uh) (uh)
but it's like at pioneer point I don't know I think can sit there and eat but then <malay>kedai dia selalu tutup</malay> my father always go saturday <malay>tutup</malay> sunday <malay>tutup</malay> then my father <malay>macam apa ni</malay> business <malay>macam mana nak buka ni kalau</malay>
ya but I think they are not earning that much as that last time with her friend
<malay>pasal dulu</malay> it never close you know
<malay>mahal kedai tu</malay> is like you know that time they asking from #sara# for twelve K a month
for that shop
ya #sara# says #sara# told me last time I was close to her <malay>juga</malay> [what] last time
yup because at first it was at four K plus after that they saw <malay>macam</malay> #sara# <malay>punya kedai</malay> always <malay>banyak banyak</malay> queue then long queue every time then the person keep increasing <malay>macam</malay> you are trying to benefit from people <malay>punya</malay> business
<malay>kedai lain semua dah tak naik</malay> tank
is cannot [what] cause that is the person's shop [what] <malay>kalau kau</malay> it's either you stay or leave [ah] <malay>gitu</malay> if the person say okay if you don't want pay then you leave [ah]
you imagine [eh] <malay>kalau kedai sekarang ni yang</malay> that twelve K a month you think they can earn or not after that
ya I mean but I don't think can even earn twelve K though
and like <malay>apa</malay> the shop obviously the shop owner <malay>dia sengaja nak</malay> #sara# <malay>punya</malay> father <malay>keluar</malay> that's why <malay>naikkan tinggi-tinggi nanti</malay> #sara# father cannot pay then surrender the shop
<malay>kedai tu</malay> [ah]
<malay>tu</malay> [jer] that's all you know
cause they always <malay>keluar gi</malay> malaysia all this together
now <malay>dorang ni ke</malay>
they are at home [what]
is either at home <malay>biasanya dorang masak kat rumah</malay> then they send to the shop
ya ya that's why maybe they busy <malay>ke dorang</malay> both at the shop
that's why they
<malay>sekarang bapa dia bawa</malay> grab [pe]
should be business <malay>tak cukup</malay> or like they have a lot of things to pay [ah] <malay>pasal dulu</malay> [kan] the business very good
then after that <malay>sekarang dah tak bagus</malay> then the father <malay>ambil</malay> car <malay>abeh ambil</malay> motor <malay>berapa banyak biji</malay> motor <malay>dia nak</malay> then the father buy for the <malay>kakak</malay> the <malay>abang pun</malay> all motor <malay>abeh sekarang</malay> business <malay>dah tak bagus</malay> how then he have to grab [ah] <malay>bawa</malay> grab pay for all this thing because obviously all these you haven't pay finish [what]
<malay>kena bayar</malay> so it's either <malay>untuk aku</malay> your if I am the father I will surrender the motor then just use the car
<malay>abeh nak bayar banyak-banyak</malay> how to afford
same
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> [ah]
<malay>bapa aku tak kasi</malay>
<malay>kau berani naik</malay> motor <malay>macam nasib kau</malay> #afiq# <malay>ada</malay> motor [kan] <malay>nanti dia</malay>
don't let you what
<malay>abeh takkan kau nak bilang mak kau</malay> [kan] #safi# <malay>nak naik</malay> motor <malay>dengan</malay>
<malay>kau rasa mak kau kasi</malay>

like if they if their bike screech or something then I fall then after that I go inside hospital

don't know <malay>kalau</malay> don't know if like it's the right choice or not ya
ya
so did you apply for the for the <malay>madrasah</malay> course
why
!alah! this is why
<malay>ilmu ilmu apa</malay> [eh] <malay>pengetahuan dunia dan akhirat</malay> [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
ya honestly
but their I mean the teaching style is quite relaxed ya
and <malay>kebanyakan macam orang</malay>
!duh! but <malay>orang muda</malay> ya <malay>macam</malay> our age [ah]
it's not a <malay>syarahan</malay> it's really <malay>macam kau belajar buku</malay> like all the <malay>buku tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay> like <malay>macam ada banyak banyak buku</malay>
<malay>kitab</malay> sure like okay sure ya
but interesting [lah] ya <malay>macam</malay> some like you never know that there are things that there are more things to be explored ya
<malay>macam</malay> sometimes the things that you know you think you know actually you don't know
ya so and it's interesting [ah] and the <malay>ustad</malay> funny
ya
<malay>macam</malay> he's like the <malay>abang-abang</malay> type <malay>dia macam</malay> just <malay>buat kelakar</malay> [ah] like every single every single lesson
ya
not we are not <malay>rapat</malay> [lah] but <malay>macam</malay>
as in like it's not like we talk everyday <malay>ke apa</malay>
[ah] ya like ya we are just no but serious <malay>macam</malay> in the whatsapp group like everyone's just like nice to each other [lah] ya
then just try to help out each other in any way that we can
ya ya all through zoom
but quite sad [lah] like I want to go back
I mean even uni also is through zoom
and I don't to be honest I don't quite like it
because <malay>macam</malay> not that productive
ya
serious
[oh]
are you serious
[oh] <malay>abeh</malay>
ya I don't even attend
because okay
cause
it's recorded ya so <malay>macam</malay> what's the point
if you wanna sit in <malay>abeh</malay> some of the students <malay>tanya banyak soalan</malay> and they can take up like twenty minutes you know just asking
cause I remember I was rewatching (uh) one of the videos [kan] as it <malay>dia macam</malay> just <malay>tanya</malay> for like like twenty minutes non stop
ya and then I just skip that part I was like
<malay>abeh</malay> lecturer <malay>dia boleh layan</malay> and he's a he's an old man [lah] so of course [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I think <malay>dia macam</malay> like
<malay>ambil hati</malay> and he would he will also <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>jawab</malay> [lah] all of <malay>apa dia punya</malay> questions
exactly she's ya
[eh]
ya so ya it's damn unproductive [lah] but then again <malay>macam</malay> if go back on campus lessons only like <malay>tiga jam</malay>
<malay>abeh pergi balik</malay>
I don't know
but I think I think physical better [ah]
ya
but <malay>malas</malay> ya and <malay>jauh jauh</malay> [seh] <malay>tempat dia</malay>
<malay>aku naik apa</malay>
but I tried going to campus before <malay>aku naik</malay> train
ya <malay>abeh kena</malay> stop [ah] <malay>dekat</malay>
(mm)
<malay>aku</malay>
[ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] no
[eh] (uh)
<malay>lupa</malay> [ah] <malay>lupa</malay>
<malay>tak pernah pergi</malay> but that time once I went there <malay>aku</malay> stop <malay>dekat</malay> I think #bugis#
(err) <malay>tak</malay> I stop at #bugis# <malay>abeh tukar</malay>
ya !duh! <malay>takkan</malay> I stop at #bugis# [sia] <malay>abeh kena naik</malay> bus
so but to be honest my dad said that like <malay>kalau</malay> my <malay>apa</malay> my <malay>kakak dapat</malay> then my dad will <malay>belikan kereta</malay>
both of us [ah]
just change [ah] <malay>macam siapa siapa</malay> like I don't know like depends on our schedule
no [lah] for what
dorm ya
no [lah] for what <malay>balik</malay> [ah]
ya but
I know but I don't think
ya
but I don't think she wants to stay at the dorm I think for us to be honest not worth it and if we have a car for what you want to stay at the dorm ya
ya <malay>fikir</malay> [ah]
ya so it makes sense [what] right ya
<malay>abeh kau</malay>
<malay>macam mana kau pergi sekolah</malay>

ya
(mm)
ya no but there was like social distancing in the cabin <malay>macam</malay> they separate with those things
ya and then they remove like I think <malay>belum lagi</malay> phase two then they remove
<malay>macam</malay> just because like [oh] decrease <malay>ye ye o</malay> [jer] <malay>abeh tak ye ye o</malay> [seh]

I mean like singapore is like
better than

ya safety one (um) I mean religion of course plays an important part I mean if I were to go to thailand
I mean it'd be difficult right language also I mean indonesia and malaysia are fine but
we have better like infrastructure and everything ya
and also <malay>macam</malay> when you settle down obviously <malay>macam</malay> you have family education here is much more better
much more better [eh] much better #singlish# <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia orang nak</malay> relax <malay>ke</malay>

no
but my dad always like wish that he has a <malay>kampung</malay> to go back to

(um) <malay>apa</malay> malaysian relatives [lah] then when we visit them during #hari raya# or whatever but now since like COVID cannot visit them
me too

scary
I don't know if I can adapt to be honest
speaking of that
(um) I watch this video this girl she lives in the woods
alone

ya and then she go and upload on youtube that she's living alone in the woods
right <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah]
I think <malay>dia macam</malay> just <malay>nak</malay> experience not for youtube I think <malay>dia memang</malay> you know sometimes you have those kind of people that just wanna live off the grid
right ya ya so she's one of them then she posted on youtube okay fine I know she didn't post like the exact location but I'm sure that people would like [eh] this place looks sort of and she's living alone
ya I'm like <malay>macam</malay> don't post [lah] if you're living alone quite dangerous [what]
you know what I mean <malay>macam</malay> any people can like if they know where exactly you're living like ya so scary
but <malay>berani</malay> [ah] <malay>dia tinggal kat kat hutan</malay>

I don't adapt well to changes
ya
but
ya
wait but listen
as in like ya I don't adapt well to changes and I know that and I acknowledge that
and I know that that is something that I like want to work on ya because I think it's good to embrace changes right
not
your head [lah] I think I'll cry
not in that sense
you
like do you like changes
like okay not like but comfortable with changes
[kan]
ya I mean like sometimes situation forces you [what] right
ya
but I don't know [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
ya
but [oh] [oh] ya to answer your question western or asian country if I if you
if I had to pick to retire I think like
western but <malay>macam</malay> I don't know
ya like would it be europe or like or like
not europe
[eh] you serious
ya but europe <malay>macam</malay> quite dangerous now right ya
so I'm not so sure maybe I'll just stay in singapore

[oh] yes yes yes yes [oh] my god
I like I was like trying to think who is the [oh] K K K yes yes yes
ya
[ha] [ha] does you feel like not being in ad hoc this year that's great
I'm proud of you for caring about yourself
volunteers
[oh] because they're not gonna do any physical okay
[ah] I see (err) no [eh] they haven't recruit volunteers for I say members
no not yet don't think so
ya
putting it on record is not your problem
no [lah] I think cause they are still trying to secure the heats
so if there's no heads they can't get the members
that will be kind of weird
(mm) ya ya ya
[oh]
[oh] okay okay that's interesting
do you miss it like joining something at least
(mm) do you intend to join
like next sem
don't know I feel like
(um) like when I join when I was in year two it was purely for the sake of okay trying out new things right and I tried both ad hoc and sub comm
and then yes <malay>nak</malay> try <malay>sangat</malay> [ah] try <malay>dua-dua sekali</malay> [lah]
why not and so <malay>entah macam dah</malay> try <malay>dua dua dah cukup</malay> [ah]
<malay>dah dan rasa</malay> okay [lah] <malay>dah dah puas</malay> then I I
experienced what I need to experienced in ad hoc ya
I feel like
I think I was like [oh] like it wasn't that great experience
and so I don't think I want to join again not in my last semester [lah]
yes last year best year
like I that was right so I am doing other shits instead of doing school stuff
that's the way
(um) <malay>cari jodoh cari jodoh</malay> who is next
okay set set
Muzmatch next sem
I try before I try before no no not me I ask my sister to download so she was like
I was like please please <malay>kakak</malay> you don't have anybody let me just try for for one hour
I feel she was like ya
no no no no no no <malay>sabar sabar</malay> no no okay so the the (um)
I downloaded for her Muzmatch [kan] can so we just wanted to see how the app works right and so like we never put anything about her [tau] like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>gambar nama</malay> [jer] like we never add in anything in her bio her profile or whatsoever and then after that (um)
it was that like it will it will really bring you to the guys [tau] so you can just swipe right or swipe left
and then like we saw the guys I was like [oh] my god there was a okay [lah]
<malay>tak boleh tak perlu tak perlu</malay>
you can just
(err) upload <malay>lepas</malay> like <malay>bila-bila masa</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak payah terus</malay> upload
ya
I actually I think so I haven't really use other apps
yes ya you try you can just try now after that <malay>lepas tu</malay> like she just delete but then she still receives like emails from cross match cause it doesn't entirely
delete your account it just delete like it just delete the apps on your phone [lor] then <malay>macam</malay> the account is still there there's something about you [what]
I don't think can
I don't know actually maybe we never look through it hard enough to find where to delete
ya so like
we swipe up one guy
nothing within the hour she deleted the account after that
didn't see it but ya so I think
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say you <malay>nak nampak</malay> more <malay>calon</malay> [kan]
I think you have to complete your profile first so when you because we never upload her her profile or everything right
then there were we it was a limit of ten guys I think
ya so we only manage to see ten guys so out of the ten guys we only swipe up one guy
he was cute he was cute <malay>tapi</malay> [kan]
<malay>orang-orang kat sana</malay> [kan] is really looking for
come here looking for like [eh] it is
but I I guess that's the whole point of (um) Muzmatch and also like like half our #deen# right the app this dating apps but the half of our #deen# is
in <malay>dia punya</malay> database include international people
so that was how my aunt got married
ya so ya
so at one point I think she was tired of finding guys she just wanted to
<malay>macam</malay> like
just go all out and try and then like okay so she she knows what she want she's like okay I'm serious I want to get married I wanted do this I want do that right I want I know what I want in a guy and so she join half of our #deen#
I think half of my #deen# or half of our #deen# I can't remember and then (um)
she met this guy so like (err) he is from another country
but like he comes to singapore and wants wants to do work and stuffs I think
and then he came to met her and the parents of her
nd then now they are happily married but now she lives in australia
ya we want international guys
sure sure ya
that was kinda kinda
cool
yes what what is that yes <malay>tapi kena bayar</malay>
the I think because
to show that you are really serious and not like having fun you know that playing around Muzmatch <malay>tak payah</malay>
half of our #deen# need you can have like yearly subscription or like I forgot what else ya I told my sister (um) by the time she reach a certain age
and she still no guy I can help pay for her subscription
if she wants
(mm)
is it
I didn't know
[oh] okay okay
I feel like Muzmatch when you want to create the thing right they will actually ask you
how halal are you ya ya they will ask you about prayers so like the question was [oh] like how often do you pray then there is like sometimes most of the time everytime that kind of thing
I feel like that's the I feel like now that you said it I feel like there was one of the questions that was asked ya so in their profile they will show
<malay>macam</malay>
I think I wouldn't mind I would say I'm not against it
it's just I I feel like
(um) not saying any couples out there who met through dating apps like you guys can be happy but like
I feel for me if I want to fall in love with a guy I have to know the guy in real life first
like I'm not the kind who superficially <malay>macam</malay> [oh] if you give me this this things about you list me this things about you then okay
you fit the ideal in because sometimes it's like act it's like you say things and you show things that you want people
to perceive of you that doesn't mean that they are truths about you
I like I rather go through the process of finding these things out myself about you and then I decide like I don't need
(um) this interface to tell me okay ya
(mm)
ya
opinions on that guy also affect my opinion on that guy also like for instance if people around him keep saying that [oh] my god it's such a nice person and he doesn't this this this then I'll be like okay see it's like he's kind to a lot of people then he must be a nice person
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya and then that's kind of hard to to do with a guy that you meet on a dating app because you don't know the his friends
right you only know him and after that if he chooses to let you in on his social circle then you will get to know his friends but besides that
you only have him ya but like you will say [lah] like if that's important then
meeting a guy in real life whom you know through like mutuals and everything is more important
[eh] do it [leh] let me be the why
no [lah] I mean sometimes <malay>dia orang</malay> K when I say <malay>dia orang</malay> serious [kan] it's like <malay>dia orang betul-betul</malay> serious want to put themselves out there
but you can tell from okay so because my sister friend
join Muzmatch for quite a while and she dated a guy on Muzmatch but like she told my sister that the guy is that (uh)
(um) quite trashy
it is so like I said like the things that they put on your profiles doesn't reflect
what who they are in real life you know I mean
ya so ya she dated a guy and then she broke up cause the guy was just too
[eh]
ya
ya like it really just depends on your <malay>rezeki</malay> I guess
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
I guess (um)
when you this is very superficial [lah] but I guess when you do it in real life
it makes you come across and that's desperate
ya because nobody knows how many guys you are talking to in in a dating app you see
you can be talking to twenty guys and that they they just think that like I mean they probably won't think you are talking to them alone because you are on a dating app but it feels like you are talking to them alone
but if you were to do it like in uni context for example when it's such a small social circle
and you put yourself out there and you
you know try your very hard right then it that case becomes desperate
ya
correct I know like I before I join (um) ad hoc and stuff like people already
say [lah] you know did like people like actually join ad hoc and stuff for the sake of
ya so actually that that was what
turn off people from joining ad hoc last time
like during before like during that time when I wanted to join
I don't know
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> [lah]
what's like your ideal date
ya [lah]
I would like to know
ideal date no I don't think so
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh]
(mm) (mm)
so is that your ideal date or your ideal first date
first date ya
[oh] ya ya ya ya but like first date you <malay>terus</malay> want to <malay>pergi</malay> trekking
I I don't think that's anything is too much
I think it's up to people preferences
[ah] because
<malay>sebab</malay> you <malay>duduk</malay> side by side
watch the movie what do you mean okay then
<malay>jangan</malay> date <malay>orang gatal</malay>
okay ya I agree with you <malay>pasal</malay> the movie like
<malay>kalau tengok</malay> movie <malay>tak boleh berbual</malay> and then you
<malay>buang masa</malay> like if it's a date like like first date you know that you <malay>buang masa</malay> like <malay>dua jam tak berbual</malay> then like
[oh]
I mean it opens up doors to topics of conversation afterwards like
if you going out to <malay>makan</malay> and everything
ya
[ha] your date how long
(um) okay K K ya trekking sounds like a great great ya
okay I first date
I like nature so
(uh) no I feel like trekking <malay>nanti</malay> (um)
I will look so unglam
like just
I I won't I won't dump it on scene on the first date I don't want you to run on the first date I'm gonna capture him first you know
like I will wait for like a few months
maybe like the second month ya [oh] let's go trekking then we see how [lah]
<malay>macam</malay> very superficial ya first ideal date [ah] I feel like
I like I like going outdoor so so so maybe I would like a picnic
ya
right ya
like I would like a picnic then we paint
<malay>lalu</malay>
ya right
like like I don't know like I had seen my friends who are couple and then go a picnics
ya
and then like <malay>dia orang masak sendiri</malay> you know and like so cute then they have like those picnic baskets and then like [oh] ya it's so cute
ya so sweet
the mat <malay>tikar</malay> flat lay yes yes yes yes
it's so beautiful
ya then after that we watch the sunset
right
[oh] no [oh] my god
okay if let's say you are on a bad date okay
would you ghost on him half way or would you
ya so <malay>macam</malay> if you think like those <malay>cerita</malay> like or like I don't know like <malay>macam</malay>
they just went toilet and then they never come back
but what if like the guy <malay>betul-betul macam</malay> very disgusting very rude
(mm)
[ah]
okay so it depends on how bad the guys is [lah]
[ah] I see
ghost
(um) so I I suddenly remember <malay>pasal</malay> you did you watch the smart local ya
ya so that was this (um) they were talking about their dating experiences so there was this person who said that he was catfished
by (um) catfish K catfish <malay>tu bukan</malay> <malay>kucing ikan</malay> okay <malay>tapi</malay> so basically like
(um) on a dating app you pretend to be someone else
or you pretend to be something very different from who you are like you don't have to pretend to be someone else but you can just pretend to be younger or older or like
shorter or taller that kind of things so
then he was catfished by a much much older woman like at at that point he was only
nineteen eighteen ya
I think so [lah] ya then after that he was catfish so when he came right like
he saw the lady was much older at that point is so young right and then like (um) he just went to toilet
and then he just never come back
ya
(mmhmm)
it is
I mean
I think if I was catfished
the the the guy obviously deserves to be ghosted
because like why in the world would you lie to me in the first place
ya right
that's why
like I don't think that's a nice way to present yourself
ya do you watch like the netflix <malay>punya</malay> [ha] what's the
[ah] I forgot the name like the dating ya ya ya ya
that's this thing (um) that you date
the girls on one side you guys on one side and then the girl and the guy will enter the same room but they cannot see each other
and then they will have like conversations <malay>bukan bukan</malay> it's not a <malay>cerita</malay> it's like dating reality
show (uh) that day I just find it
<malay>sekejap</malay> [eh]
ya and then (err) so basically they will get to know each other through those rooms for like a few days
and then after that like if they like each other right they they can continue meeting each other through those room but they cannot see each other so when they can see each other is when the guy or the girl if you want proposed to the other person
so only when they are engaged
then they can meet and this all happened within one month
have you watched that so far it is it is
I I really forgot what's the show [ah] cry
maybe just finding
[kan]
just you know
I mean at this [oh] love is blind yes yes yes
ya love is blind is it was a pretty interesting show actually
(err) ya ya ya it is it is
like out of
many couples right only two got married <malay>tak salah</malay> I
ya
so even then there were a lot of dramas and everything because you can only meet the person so
at that point it was really a matter of
(um) they will basically they were trying to prove like does looks matter do looks matter
ya like in in a relationship
so at that point because you cannot see the other person so it's really about
whether you can really appeal to this person just through your personality [lah]
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
would you ever
no I I would be
I I feel like ya but like but like
I I think in matters to some extent that I get to see who I'm interacting with and potentially get engaged to you know
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
match making [ah]
(um) yes yes I guess it is the same thing like
ya but I guess that [one] is it's kind of sad [lah] cause they don't have a choice you know
ya
what change
that's nice too right
I used to set deadlines for myself okay twenty five I must get married
ya it is
ya really is right but like that was when I was like still young and naive and just thought like [ah] you know
ya twenty five sounds like a good age after uni ya
and I no guy also like where am I going to look for
guy ya like
I have but I have a lot of my batch mates <malay>dia orang dah beli</malay> you know
my batch mates [tau] I understand seniors but my own age
ya ya like
shit
ya ya [kan] is
is I feel like it's really stupid like the the fact that
can only apply where people can only apply if they are getting marry and stuff and then like how the age limit to buy an apartment
the law says it's thirty five years old like I think that's really stupid
(err) ya and also like
I think the government also want people to procreate right so like they want people to get married have children so that's an incentive for them
yes
yes #hazimah#
for women our future generation to suffer
ya
[oh] my
actually ya that's a good thing [ah] and I I've thought about this my answer is no [lah] I don't think I'm willing to have children
at it like in this knowing that the world is like this
nonsense nonsense it is it is and like
I don't know like I don't think I want my children to grow up in singapore
like not it's too stressful then
to be a minority in singapore it's something like in other countries you will still be a minority
true
true true true it's just that for a country that price itself over
multiculturalism multi racialism whatever
ya
I saw I saw my history teacher posted this on story
so it was about this article about this (um) malay muslim lady who decided to make <malay>halal</malay> mooncakes because
there are a lot of <malay>halal</malay> mooncakes in singapore and then her caption was like you suppose to hiatus already his her caption was
(um) to my sec four students (uh) here like (um) no actually is like [oh] (uh)
both she teaches both so she was like here is a good
[oh] I'm proud to live in singapore (err) to my sec four students here is a good example of multiculturalism
and then just like right right and then I'm just like
but like you see you can always find minorities doings stuff to be
to like make an effort to accept other cultures but you don't see majorities doing that the same for minority cultures
so you can't possibly say that is multiculturalism if it just fits into
your ya
correct and then I was like [oh] K
no I haven't have you but I saw snippets of it
[oh] god
I saw I saw yes
about like [oh] like why did you not care about politics [oh] because is fatally boring right it was like it's boring
it's boring to you because you don't care about the or you don't care to change about the world that fits you perfectly ya
that's exactly what I discussed with a friend that I fell out with
you know like
it is but
no it's not some disagreements and like like I said to this friend like
it's not something that you can just agree to disagree not when my rights are
being violated you know like when not when I'm denied these rights
(um) have privilege over
you know it comes easy for you and that's why you can just choose to say I don't want to care about politics because it's so boring and it doesn't concern me but for me
politics is so deeply entrenched in every aspect of my life and for you to say that
(uh) like being so nonchalant about it it it hurts me [lah] because then do I even matter to you
because I feel like if you want to be
(um) you (uh)
are a majority in this country right you have a lot of power and privilege
and if you're not willing to do something with that power and privilege
then you're just being an oppressor already you know if you are not on the side of the oppressed you are with the oppressor
<malay>dia orang tak sedar diri</malay> [oh] my god
then <malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>kalau kita bilang dia orang</malay> [kan] [oh]
<malay>korang ada</malay> chinese privilege or whatever [kan] <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
<malay>kecil hati</malay> [oh] <malay>mana ada mana ada korang korang ni</malay> just oversensitive [lah]
ya
I <malay>pernah ada kawan ni</malay>
<malay>dia tak percaya</malay> chinese privilege exists in singapore
<malay>dia mati-mati tak percaya</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> because is is okay
I so
perhaps it's also because if they acknowledge that chinese privilege exist then they have to
face the fact that you know the there's this inherent problem in the system
that is damn perfect suits them perfectly but denies
(uh) huge like minority groups of the same rights and privileges you know then then they will have to to you know they know that there needs to be changed by they are unwilling to go through that change because it brings inconvenience to them ya
ya
so <malay>dia betul-betul tak percaya</malay> [tau] chinese privilege exists
<malay>habis dia dia buat</malay> this long twitter thread <malay>pasal</malay>
(um)
it doesn't exist <malay>pasal</malay> [oh] (um)
<malay>budak-budak melayu tak bayar</malay> school fees <malay>untuk sekolah</malay> it's very very cheap compared to <malay>budak-budak lain</malay>
and then like talking about Mendaki system (uh) subsidies and stuff and like
<malay>dia betul-betul usaha</malay> [tau] <malay>untuk</malay>
prove that no chinese privilege ya
it's (uh) (uh) [oh] my god when I read it I was like K [lah] <malay>buang masa</malay> [jer] [lah] I <malay>baca tak ada apa-apa</malay> it's okay thank you very much
ya it's just (um)
it's just
ya I feel like
when people say that [oh] you want more why why is it that you need more many represents or more minority representation
for you to hear minorities kind of what they face ya right like why do you need so is that you only hear people with power
what then then who are you really representing that you are not representing the people's voices you are representing yourselves people with power amongst yourselves
yes yes that's
ya so
so <malay>kesimpulannya</malay>
<malay>saya tak nak anak-anak saya</malay>
<malay>awak</malay> [a'ah] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>tak kisah pasal</malay> (um)
<malay>rakyat-rakyatnya yang</malay>
ya it's true true but you see why is it that we always have to compare with other countries why can't we just compare with our own and admit that it's sucks
<malay>bersyukur</malay>
ya
I don't think you should just compare countries across countries like that
which countries
ya I agree with you like
there are other form of oppression that minorities face in singapore it doesn't have to be
[oh] because [oh] like other countries if you are muslim you die you know but in singapore like there are oppressions like #hijabi# don't get to wear a #hijab# all the time
there are instances at work where they have to remove that and that is something conflicting with religion and
you know being in workforce
ya
ya
ya like
ya it's like [oh] we should be grateful that we are giving you some rights [oh] [oh] okay
ya like
ya like okay can then like
I think like <malay>dulu</malay> (um)
coming from a I feel like a
I would say privilege background
like I was very (um)
blind sided to all these issues that was prevalent to this society
like I was
I feel like I was like always trying to be accepted in
ya ya
ya
ya
took a lot of unlearning to finally accept that you know what
it's okay like
ya like I'm proud of being who I am and I shouldn't care about what others
like
I mean that's how conversation works
[oh] my god like ya
ya I feel like recess week is ending kind of fast

then like they like she had to she couldn't come out [lah] she was she rested in
in his own enclosure
ya
like the I think #kai kai# is the guy [one] #kai kai# was (um)
#kai kai# <malay>masih makan jumpa makan makan makan</malay>
<malay>habis dia makan</malay> ya
[ah] menopause ya
so <malay>dia pun</malay> pregnant [lah]
[oh] ya <malay>dia makan banyak</malay> [tau] <malay>tapi yang</malay> the pregnant
the #jia jia# was just sleeping like rolling around sleeping
ya so then the <malay>apa tu</malay> (err)
(err) #kai# #jia# #kai kai# #kai kai# <malay>dia asyik makan</malay> [tau] <malay>dia habis makan satu</malay> bamboo stick <malay>panjang</malay> [kan]
<malay>selepas tu dia dia</malay> crawl <malay>dia ambil lagi lepas tu dia patahkan dia makan lagi</malay>
the whole time <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>makan</malay> [tau] I was there for a good ten to fifteen minutes I just watch
eating and eating my god <malay>dia orang</malay> cute gila
I love pandas they are so clumsy just
yes
yes
does it include animals
babies like on where instagram
maybe that's why your algorithm is just on this yes ya
(mm) that is interesting I think mine is also on
(uh) <malay>apa tu apa tu kucing</malay> and also you know those <malay>macam</malay> couple couple <malay>buat</malay> video
no it's not it's because <malay>kita orang asyik tengok</malay> some videos <malay>pasal</malay> couple couple so the algorithm just
shows that
<malay>macam sedih</malay> [kan]
<malay>apa</malay>
ya
ya but like I feel sometimes <malay>dia orang</malay> post <malay>benda yang</malay>
should have just kept it to themselves <malay>macam</malay> something not everything other people should be
shared to everyone in the world because some things are so intimate like
ya like I was saying (um)
like something are just so intimate <malay>macam</malay> I recently saw this video <malay>pasal</malay>
[oh] (um) <malay>dia</malay> went through
miscarriage and then <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>teman lelaki tengah nangis</malay> on the bed <malay>dan macam dia tengah</malay> comfort <malay>teman lelaki dia</malay> I think
a bit <malay>dia ambil</malay> video on this stuff <malay>dia macam saja nak</malay> post [jer] then I am just like this kind of things in life are
so intimate to you guys I
maybe different people have different perceptions of what is intimate to them but in my opinion this kind of things are
I don't know it's just
true
true true true true I
I would say that I can agree with that of course like I I'm all for you know normalising guys crying and miscarriages happen in huge like
be able to talk about it openly but as you know it's just
ya ya
so ya I don't know like
(uh) I like when I watch videos <malay>macam dia orang</malay>
<malay>tunjuk dia orang pergi</malay> on dates <malay>tunjuk orang buat begini begitu</malay> cute cute
they are like
<malay>apa</malay> [ah] <malay>apa</malay> challenge
<malay>dia orang buat apa</malay>
I see
ya
there is this I have this favourite couple the guy is so sweet and then like there was like a date the girlfriend did a challenge called my husband and then the guy was like [oh]
my heart you just called me your husband
[oh] so cute
I guess maybe like at that stage they still don't know yet but then when someone says it like that it gives them more reassurance that one day it's gonna happen you know
you you can try [lah] like [oh] like do a live [oh] my husband here then like
then your mother follows you right later your mother [oh] okay [lah] then your friends then
husband <malay>bila dah nikah bila</malay> [ha]
#adam# <malay>apa siapa tu</malay> (uh huh)
<malay>pelamin dia kat rumah</malay> [eh]
<malay>nak tahu</malay> [ah]
I've never thought of it that way
<malay>bodoh</malay> [lah]
emcee <malay>cakap</malay> (um) <malay>mari</malay> (um) <malay>teman-teman dan keluarga</malay>
(um) <malay>semua orang sila carikan pengantin pengantin perempuan hilang</malay>
[oh] my god that time my sister <malay>pergi kawan dia punya kakak</malay>
(um) <malay>majlis perkahwinan</malay> then it was <malay>cantik gila dia tepi laut</malay> and
it's it's not open <malay>dia bukan takde</malay> shelter it's sheltered <malay>cuma tapi dia macam</malay> how to say (uh) it's like <malay>kampung</malay> style open windows so there is a shelter but it's <malay>tepi laut</malay>
like it by the beach <malay>tepi laut</malay> kind <malay>cantik gila</malay> like <malay>dia punya</malay> deco and like the view
true true <malay>kalau nanti hujan masuk</malay> confirm <malay>mahal</malay> it's definitely <malay>mahal</malay> it's a it's a well-known expensive wedding venue no no K see I have
this rule is that <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>nak kahwin</malay> actually <malay>takde majlis pun</malay> okay actually ya
like <malay>secara jujurnya majlis bukan untuk kita majlis untuk ibu bapa</malay> ya ya like because
I've heard like a lot of times people like the the people the guest coming to the wedding are not really people that you
know or are close with they are just people that you invite because it's a formality that you have to maintain relationships yes yes
with family members ya
[kan] and like in this pandemic like you
it is telling [lah] that that's actually you don't actually need to invite a lot of people you can just stick two hundred people and and that's it
you know
ya <malay>orang kecil hati</malay> [kan]
ya so
#inshallah#
putting it out there yes I think my my family won't be nice too
okay [lah] good luck to my sister then
<malay>terima kasih kerana menghadiri</malay> (um) <malay>bersama</malay>
#alisha# <malay>dan sekian terima kasih</malay>

[oh] my god ya okay so I ended up buying the gold [one] apparently on Apple it says gold but then actually it's rose gold like she's like gorgeous and she's obviously rose gold not gold so I don't know whether people are blind or something
I like yeah she's gorgeous
what about you what have you been doing baby

<malay>perangai</malay> what
okay <malay>perangai babi</malay> then
[orh]
okay then
you like on apparently on the freaking website it says gold but then the actual thing is actually rose gold like it's very very tinted pink
like you like if you just put it on top of your table it just looks rose gold like I don't know whether is I <malay>mata potek</malay> or like <malay>orang</malay> Apple <malay>mata potek</malay> I do not know like I genuinely don't know
ya so there's that
yes girl girl bought MacBook air
cause she's airy or what
(err)
I don't know I upgraded some shit and I don't know what
so like around one seven
so now officially girl girl is broke I [dah] <malay>tak ada duit</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> #makan# <malay>pun tak boleh</malay> you know I was like thinking of buying like
some
sushi for two dollars and I solid like contemplated for a solid ass like five minutes in front of that thing and I was like I think the uncle was just like
I thought he was like thinking I'm gonna take some like twelve dollars sushi and then I proceeded to take a two dollars sushi I was just standing there just like
should I buy should I no but I'm broke I'm broke I have to last like fifty dollars for the next like three weeks or something like that then I want to go drinking and all that blah blah blah I'm like (um)
there's that there's that tea
okay so that day
no
I had always had money then after that when I realised that I wanted to buy the a new laptop
then I just set aside all my money and then I started
working to hit one point seven so at the start I think I had about one K already then I need seven hundred more so last month I was broke to get that seven hundred and then now I got the seven hundred then now I'm broke cause I have no money at all you know what I mean
I was
broke because the money is set aside for something what do you mean fake broke <malay>apa</malay> #lan jiao# <malay>kau apa merepek kau nak cari gaduh ke apa</malay>
but I had this amount of money and this entire amount of money is set aside for my baby ass laptop my baby boo so I am broke okay girl girl doesn't lie
kay
so that day I was
(um)
going to
I don't know who I was meeting
then
<malay>lepas tu</malay> I
I remember like
this
I don't know why I like just suddenly I was just on the train and then apparently like we pass by Admiralty then I think I saw somebody who looks similar to him or not I just don't know so (um)
so
since I don't know whether I got tell you this story [ah] like since
(um) primary six
right since primary six I was primary six okay like I will like <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] my mum <malay>pakai tudung</malay>
so like <malay>dia pakai tudung</malay> then <malay>kalau dia nak potong rambut</malay> [kan] <malay>nak kena pergi</malay> to somebody's house you know to <malay>tutup aurat</malay> and all that [lah]
so my mum will go to this auntie's house
like they are like fucking far extended family kind of shit [lah] but like <malay>raya</malay> have to go to their house cause it's like some <malay>nenek punya nenek punya kakak punya</malay> some shit [lah]
so it's like super complicated then my mum I don't know how she just
like knows the auntie so like she will go like when she was younger to cut her hair then once I started like to <malay>pakai tudung</malay> in primary school my mom brought me there [lah] instead of like the normal <malay>kedai</malay> barber and all that
then since primary six up until last year because COVID was this year what so up until last year I will always have to go to her house to cut hair
this auntie has a son who is two years older than me okay
since fucking primary six <malay>sampai</malay> last year this motherfucker has been like forcing me to <malay>jadi dia punya</malay>
daughter-in-law <malay>dalam bahasa melayu apa</malay>
yes okay I keep on forgetting that word obviously <malay>menantu</malay> material right there but like she has been wanting me to be her <malay>menantu</malay> for god knows why like I'm so messed up I'm so fucked up but she still wants me to be her <malay>menantu</malay> you know <malay>dulu</malay> right when I was like like twelve <malay>nanti benda dia</malay> #macam# <malay>kecil</malay> [jer] [ah] #macam# she will be like
[orh] like what do you think of my <malay>anak</malay> like that like <malay>nanti aku duduk</malay> like <malay>dia kasi aku</malay> #makan# <malay>nanti dia cakap</malay> you think by the way his name is okay let's let's give him like give me a nice Malay name like he's actually decent looking he's not ugly
even though I have a thing for Chinese guy he's not ugly when you have like put it on a Malay scale if there's something like that [ah] give me a Malay name
kay let's just use
!hais! neither do I but like there is one there is one
kay
let's just use
okay let's just use his name [ah]
so his name is #Adi#</P2>
then like she will like when she will like
yeah his name is #Adi#</P2> something
ya I think
like it's a long name [ah] but let's just use a generic one [ah] then after that
so
(um) she like ask me like what do you think of #Adi#</P2> then I'll be like like <malay>apa kau merepek</malay> like that is your son what am I actually supposed to say you know
then after that like I will just avoid the question just act blur #sotong# and all that all [lah] I don't know what I will do [lah] I cannot really remember
then after that like I don't know about you [ah] but I don't know like what happened like it just started to escalate then like last year right I go and <malay>salam dia punya mak</malay> [lah] cause like I don't know why
then I have to <malay>salam</malay> the mum then
everytime she asks questions like do I have a boyfriend
or all that I will let my mum talk [lah]
then I will just never talk to the aunt even [eh] the mum even though like
the questions are posed to me
so last year right dude
I <malay>salam dia nya</malay> mum and then straightaway <malay>dia punya</malay> mum was like
(err) <malay>kenapa lambat sangat nak salam mak mentua</malay>
then I was just like
!huh!
!huh! <malay>sejak bila aku ada mak mentua sejak bila</malay> I'm like fucking nineteen and I was like
(err) I'm like my fucking future is a freaking pitch black hole and this base is like
<malay>kenapa kau datang lambat tak nak salam mak mentua kau</malay> and I was just confused you know I was just like
number one
lady hold up hold up I love it that you love me so much like thank you I <malay>sayang</malay> you also baby and you always feed me good food but like besides the point I have never even spoken
not even a single word to the dude you know not even one word can you believe it she wants me to marry a guy that I have never even said hi to
like hi like I don't even know how his voice sounds like that's the problem right now
like is always the mum and the sisters looking at me up down <malay>ketawa ketawa gelek gelek sendiri</malay> and then like he's never there
like they will just laugh and then they will just like like that like that and then I'm just like I obviously know you you're talking about me and laughing and like you know teasing me but like why like I've never even spoken to the dude before and I don't know why
I thought about that because I think I'm just dreading next year <malay>raya</malay> and then that is one of the things that I'm dreading [ah]
how I cut my hair
[ah] the last time I went to an actual barber
like I <malay>tudung</malay> and all that
ya so after I told !huh!
no after I told my mum that I was genuinely uncomfortable with everything we stopped going there
it's been sometimes since I went to the house already
ya cause the harassing or like I don't know whether is considered harassing or not it's kinda cute
if you think of it in one perspective it's really cute
but if you think of it that it's been happening since primary six I'm kinda traumatized is how many years already
cause every year I go to her house and every year she will like ask me like do I have a boyfriend what do I think of her son <malay>kau nak jadi aku nya</malay>
(um)
<malay>menantu ke tak</malay> that that happened last year [lah] but like you know it just escalates to suddenly I'm the <malay>menantu</malay> that's all
I don't know baby but what about you do you not ever had harassed
like I don't know it seems like
yeah I even
ya [lah] it's not considered harassed [lah] that's true
but like
[kan] I don't know it's just like a <malay>melayu nya</malay> thing
like <malay>makcik makcik</malay> be really all up in your face be like <malay>kau nak jadi aku punya</malay> (err) <malay>menantu ke tak</malay>
like how do they actually
judge you
per say you know
like
for my
my situation like I actually
they don't even know anything about me other than which school I go to I don't think she even knows what's my favourite colour
and what is she judging me as like on judging me on
when she wants me to be her
<malay>menantu</malay> like girl girl doesn't like to cook I like to bake but I don't like to cook
is that a good <malay>menantu</malay> quality like
you know it's just weird that's just what I was thinking about [lah]
that's all there's that
especially if <malay>makcik</malay> got a son that is like freaky
like you know older than you or the same age or older gone girl girl bolt outta there and run
get out
<malay>makcik</malay> I am permanently staying here you like me right can I get married now

okay
you're already late
okay what the what the heck he's so weird you want to meet your girlfriend but then you also want to <malay>berak</malay> then you don't want to <malay>berak</malay> first and then it's just like
confused
<malay>apa yang dia nak ni</malay>
!ee! [oh] my god dude
I don't know <malay>nak cakap</malay> childish <malay>ke nak cakap tak ada otak ke tak faham</malay> [sia]

[oh] my god okay okay I also have a story to tell you okay it's like kinda similar so my friend met this guy like recently okay so they've been talking
like from then until now is only been two months okay one month into knowing
(err) one month into knowing each other
they got together
and then recently I met her so it's going to be about two months but not really (um) I heard that
the dude already met the girl's mum
on an actual like they actually plan the thing you know I was like thinking
kay wait <malay>kau nya</malay> boyfriend <malay>jumpa mak kau sebab</malay> #macam# <malay>kena</malay> caught is it like like <malay>terserempak kat</malay> somewhere then she's like no
like we actually planned a day for her mum to meet the guy and then I was like
<malay>lelaki tu yang nak lelaki lelaki tu yang</malay> suggest and then she was like ya and I was just like
!huh!
and then apparently like this coming okay I mean today is what day Friday so apparently they say either Saturday or Sunday the girl my friend is the one that is now my friend is going to meet the guy's mum
or or Sunday
yeah
yeah
don't you think it's fucking fast first of all right they've been they've known each other for less than two months got together in less than one month and have been together for two weeks and within that span of two weeks both of their parents like they met both their parents so the first week of getting together the guy met the girl's mum and then the second week is the girl meet the guy's mum
isn't that a bit fast
#lan jiao# I've been together with a guy for one year my mother <malay>tak tahu</malay> [sia]
and then this one
ya and cause he's Chinese but like
I cannot comprehend
like you know they took for less than two months and then you are confident enough
that
you bring
actually I also <malay>tak faham</malay> [lah]
so apparently they actually stated to each other both like both of them stated to each other like I'm not gonna play around but is both of their first relationship but then they actually clearly specify I <malay>tak nak main main</malay> okay and then suddenly I <malay>tak nak main main</malay> equals to you <malay>kena jumpa mak</malay> I
so like I <malay>tak faham</malay> girl girl <malay>tak</malay> believe it
even if I start dating like while lo and behold
I go and date some Malay guy I am sure as heck not gonna like ask him to come meet my mother in the first two weeks of getting together
okay
maybe not even like one year
so like I don't understand
how does this work
I just <malay>tak faham</malay> I was just like
what the heck like it's cute
that the guy actually
was the one who told my friend like [eh] I want to meet your <malay>mak</malay>
but like one week into getting together though
I don't know
I just <malay>tak tahu</malay>
like just touch wood [lah] imagine if you don't
like he's not the one that you marry and then <malay>korang</malay> like !wah! full blown invested like I don't know [ah] I I was just confused I never would
have gotten together in the first place [ah] of knowing a guy for less than one month
but then there's also #Saif#</P2> so
Rudy #Aip# what's up
okay cool
!huh!
what
what
!huh!
wait what I cannot even comprehend that
so this girl like freaking younger than me had a boyfriend <malay>lepas tu buka</malay> bank account
<malay>sebab nak kahwin</malay> like they actually like
<malay>kumpul duit</malay>
<malay>nak kahwin</malay>
are they still together
to get out of jail
[ah]
because I met another person
like the effort
I don't know babe like you cannot really judge
like
I don't know
I don't know man
[oh] ya [sia] like I don't know recently like
I I get both sides cause you know as a girl you want reassurance but like you cannot deny you want reassurance but then the fact that you are asking for reassurance about something so far fetched
is very weird like
cause
<malay>dulu</malay> I would do it <malay>dulu</malay> I was that kind of girl okay I wouldn't go to the extent of like putting my money
in but I would like
want him to tell me like !hey! we're gonna be in this for the long run [lah]
so okay so
(um)
there's this one friend of mine
like
(um) her name is Amy</P2>
then like
[ah]
[ah] yeah yeah yeah so
most of our friends like our mutual friends are like dating like have been dating for like five years or whatever like really really long so they actually know let's say like
we're gonna get married here this day [eh] this year and like we are gonna plan for it [lah] like they actually have a plan like a future Amy</P2> has been together with her boyfriend for like a solid five months
and then her boyfriend is the logical type okay like Amy</P2> and me are the same we're like fucking romantic and be like baby I love you I love you from the moon to the moon back whatever bull crap right and then the guy is the type that won't say anything that
he knows it's might not be true you know
so
(um) she's then recently she got jealous that
her boy like her friends are like all thinking about marriage and future and then
like her boyfriend doesn't even want to say like she will say shit like
[oh] I hope it's going to be you in the end or like I hope it's you
the rest of my life that kind of shit and then like he will just dodge the entire thing

give her reassurance that he's gonna be there for her like
till the end then she wants to do a keto diet so that she can be skinny
and you know <malay>dapat</malay>
that body goals I don't know man it's just a whole ass mess like she's just so sad
there's that but then you also need
ya I just that's why I was thinking like I get her point of view like I get it cause I really think that if you really love someone
no matter what
you still want reassurance that they're gonna be there
for a long time

[oh] yeah talking about your <malay>madrasah</malay>
I never
at the start I went to a <malay>masjid madrasah</malay> for awhile only like
before Andalus I started in primary one so I think when I was like in kindergarten like for two years I was at
<malay>masjid</malay> #Ahmad Ibrahim#
have you heard I think you've heard about it before no
yeah
so
(um)
the <malay>baju</malay> is green colour and then my <malay>tudung</malay> is yellow in colour so maybe that's where my name like nyonya <malay>telur</malay> came about cause girl girl imagine with that circle face and then the yellow <malay>tudung</malay> really not cute
but okay so the only thing I don't even remember going there you know but the only thing that I remember [oh] my god I love my whole story is that right
I came back home
one day from school cause my parents will always fetch me cause it's like in the middle like it's not even in
the <malay>sekolah</malay> is in the middle of like a <malay>hutan</malay>
but is in the middle of a road
and then after that right like
after that
(um)
one day I went back home and then I just told my mum
ma somebody kiss me on the cheek
I'm a fucking kindergarten kindergarten is what fucking six years old or five five to six years old I went back home I was like ma somebody kiss me on my cheek and then my mother was like the fuck is wrong then after that they realised right that
like then next day they went and like find out who the guy who the guy is like <malay>siapa lelaki yang cium anak aku</malay> you know it's like maybe I don't know
but like they went right
my <malay>yayi</malay> and my mum <malay>pergi</malay> [ah] <malay>pergi</malay> to the <malay>masjid</malay> and then after that they actually like found out the the guy that kiss me
was like a family friend
it was so messy and then like I was just like I don't even know how he looks like you know <malay>sekarang</malay> I cannot remember like I cannot remember anything
then like
I remember like they will talk about it so recently like they will just say you know like instead of saying the guy's name or the mum's name
they will just say you know <malay>lelaki yang cium</malay> #Syafiqah#</P2> <malay>kat madrasah</malay>
[ah] then I was just like
you know <malay>dia</malay> literally casually called the dude that name and apparently that he's still in my life
but I don't know who he is I've never seen him before but his name will pop out like my <malay>nyai</malay> will like talk about it to my mum
somehow
it's so weird so it's kind
I cannot remember but the only thing I can remember is what my mum is telling me which I did
to tell her which is just I just waddle waddle up and then be like mama mama [ah] <malay>ada orang cium</malay> #Iqah#</P2> <malay>kat pipi</malay> and then I like went like this to my cheeks and all that and then my mother was like what the fuck is going on
and then my mum went down the next day with my <malay>nyai</malay> to go and see the guy and then apparently the guy like people will fetch your child what cause it's like in a #ulu# place
then when like I was maybe I pointed to the guy or something and then the guy was with the mum and then the mum barely knows my <malay>nyai</malay>
and then I was just like
it's damn weird
ya so ya there's that so I don't know about you but girl girl got kissed at the cheek when she was five
I hate myself so much I was such a hoe
at such a young age
I cannot believe it <malay>ni perangai</malay>
<malay>bakal nak jadi</malay> <malay>menantu orang</malay> you know this is the <malay>perangai</malay> that it <malay>perangai</malay>

<malay>asal asal</malay> still <malay>kena</malay> cause <malay>kau jiwa melayu apa</malay>
in the future but why is the future is now
okay like in the future I <malay>kau</malay>
mix
okay
okay
<malay>tapi</malay> like (um)
[ah] <malay>kalau</malay> #macam# like
a lot of like
(um) mix [ah] <malay>apa</malay> mixed racial marriages <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] then <malay>anak anak dorang semua</malay> mixed like <malay>muka campur gitu</malay> [ah] then
like on their especially in singapore like on their it will state
what race they are what
ya [lah] then it will never never end what <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>lapan bangsa</malay> from where
but it won't be like that what cause you only you only like
you only come out of your mum and dad
like you are only from your mum and dad [pe] <malay>tak</malay> [kan] like you want to <malay>kira</malay> your <malay>nenek moyang semua</malay>
there there's where the like one quarter one quarter comes from
[oh] okay okay
no
you shouldn't
why
wait but
no but as okay race first of all race is socially constructed
<malay>tak ada kau kata</malay> like it's not (um)
(err)
like it's not fair for like kids to have as if not fair for people to get based on their dad's <malay>punya</malay> race [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> at the same time <malay>kau kata</malay> like they shouldn't choose so
<malay>apa yang</malay>
like what's your point
(uh huh)
(mm)
like you say they shouldn't choose
[oh]
do you know that got some #macam#
[ah]
like <malay>kalau</malay>
okay <malay>kalau kau</malay> chindian [kan] like chinese indian then you want to buy a house then you know cause of the race racial <malay>apa tu</malay> the quota that one right
then ya you can choose whether you want to identify yourself as chinese or indian and not obviously people will choose
(um) probably indian cause
cause like
I mean okay I don't know
no they will choose indian
cause
cause like <malay>kalau</malay> this one
<malay>dorang</malay> [dah] <malay>ramai gila cina</malay>
then they need indian [pe] and then that their open slot is only indian like #macam# that open open #macam# the empty house is only open to indians
so <malay>kalau kau</malay> chindian then <malay>kau</malay> identify your like you can choose right then you identify yourself as indian then you can take but if you identify yourself as chinese then you cannot take cause
that only that one empty slot
is like reserved considered a reserved for [ah] indian
ya
[ah]
[a'ah] I I don't know if like we can <malay>jual</malay> like <malay>jual</malay> to <malay>melayu</malay> [eh] <malay>jual</malay> to india or not
then I know like you have to <malay>jual</malay> to like
probably the same race
[a'ah] [a'ah]
ya
ya cause like you also sell at a lower price cause you want to #macam# some people want to get rid of it fast so like they just put it low so that people buy the higher chance of people buying [ah] so it's like
(um)
(uh) it's like a social social inequality cause <malay>kita</malay> minorities <malay>selalu</malay>
okay [ah] I don't want to say <malay>selalu</malay> cause it's too like absolute but
(uh)
(uh) <malay>banyak kali</malay>
(um)
!chey! <malay>dipinggir</malay> yes ya yes ya
ya <malay>dipinggir</malay> is like [ah] #macam# <malay>jadi</malay> outlier <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
ya
(um) honestly <malay>aku rasa</malay>
okay honestly maybe for me like I still support it but is just that I feel like (um) there needs to be more help
to mitigate the problem of [ah] like #macam#
whatever inequality that we mentioned just now [ah]
so <malay>aku rasa</malay> #macam#
cause <malay>kalau tak ada</malay> quota <malay>ni semua</malay> [kan] confirm there's like racial different like racial segregation [ah] cause like #macam#
[ah] yes [ah] #macam#
<malay>kau</malay> imagine [ah] woodlands confirm <malay>kampung melayu</malay> [sia] woodlands #yishun#
#yishun# <malay>tak sangat</malay> #yishun# maybe like #yishun# maybe like chinese a bit <malay>ada</malay> indian <malay>aku tak tahu</malay>
[eh] [eh] <malay>kau takmo</malay>
yeah (um) <malay>abeh</malay> #punggol# probably
I don't know #macam# <malay>cina</malay> maybe
ya so to a certain extent I guess like it's justified but did you know that #macam# this (um)
this like racial quota right is only applicable to public housing so #macam# all those like private private properties <malay>semua</malay> [kan] #macam# like <malay>rumah sebuah sebuah semua</malay>
<malay>dorang tak ada</malay> [seh] that's why like they can get away with all this like

actually not dorm more like rental rental places so like they can choose their roommates kind of thing then
like [ah] for workers and from china <malay>semua</malay> they live together then from india bangladesh <malay>semua</malay> live together since like the segregation is there already and then also like in in like
like those big houses [kan] it's like that's the
(um) expats [ah] #macam# those <malay>orang putih</malay> then they tend to live in like bigger houses [pe] so there's the #macam# they are quite detached from our society

[dah] okay bye

hi
hello how are you
okay okay
okay beauty in everyone
(mm)
(uh huh)
okay okay
(uh) definition of beauty [eh] okay
(uh) personally I think I don't have any good looks
so beauty to me I would define it as personality and manners <malay>adab</malay> [lah] <malay>adab</malay>
what about you like what's your definition of beauty
(mm)
(mm) insecurities
(mm)
(mm)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) okay look before <malay>kita</malay> start [kan] (um)
okay like for you do you think beauty
(uh) okay <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] (um)
beauty in the long term would you ya would you for example would you friend someone who is okay because for beauty some people define it as good looks but then good looks to me (uh) I I see as a short term thing
so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>sebab kalau kita lawa pun macam mana</malay>
ten years down the road <malay>bila kita dah</malay> ageing then you know it'll be no longer as beautiful as you were
ya ya ya
ya okay so my question is like do you think (um)
(um) <malay>macam</malay> for example friendship [lah] <malay>macam kita nak buat kawan baru</malay> [kan]
would you would you go for that beauty in the short term basis or a long term basis
(um)
okay
(mmhmm)
true true true
attention ya
(mmhmm)
(um) true true
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
(err) <malay>tahu tahu</malay>
#inshaallah# <malay>tak</malay>
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mm) like
true true true
okay (uh)
okay okay <malay>untuk aku</malay> [kan] because <malay>poli poli aku</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> what I can observe was from my course most of them most of them like
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] (um) define
(uh) for my course okay because my course
my course <malay>banyak</malay> cliques [tau] then (um) in the year one ya during year one we have this orientation [kan] so <malay>macam apa aku</malay> observe [kan]
they the popular ones they tend to find they tend to clique each other so like popular what my definition of popular is <malay>dia orang</malay> popular and then they are
they are very loud
ya they are very vocal [lah] then and they have good looks also so
<malay>macam</malay> for me (uh) in my course most of the cliques <malay>yang macam</malay> the big cliques right they tend to I mean they are closer to people (um) they
they are closer to people that <malay>macam ada</malay> good looks <malay>semua</malay> so <malay>macam</malay>
ya fashion wise also [ah]
yes
(mm)
(mmhmm) ya
ya
(mm)
ya true
(um) ya true
so it's very very subjective [lah] in terms of <malay>macam mana dia orang</malay> select (uh) friends and ya and how the friendship last till
ten years down the road ya
(mm) true true
yes
competition
[oh] okay
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya
(um) okay
(uh) for working life [eh]
I think
it's subjective also because if you were to join in in the beauty industry then I think like good looks is the first ya like first priority that they will look into then followed by talent
but then like if we were talking about like general industry so <malay>macam</malay> teaching <malay>ke</malay> (uh)
ya design <malay>ke ataupun</malay> like social service ya F&B also then I think what is for me if I want to be an employer then I would first look like experience and like how willing is a person
to how willing is the person to work in my company
and then beauty is like
it depends beauty <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know like I don't really place any priority in beauty
ya (mmhmm)
(err) yes yes
ya ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(um)
beauty in appearance or mindset personality wise
(uh)
okay like I think it's natural for humans to like
the first the first glance ya yes yes yes
but I think that one also subjective because some people they they have this they like certain (uh) like <malay>macam</malay> for example for female right they like males <malay>macam</malay>
the <malay>lelaki yang ada</malay> certain features so ya so it really is very subjective but for me
(err) yes
okay so for me appearance or mindset in a partner
<malay>aku rasa macam</malay> are we talking in like first first
first time impression or
[ah] okay
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay
(uh) I think will be mindset slash personality wise
(um) like <malay>kau nak</malay> share
(uh) okay okay
okay (uh) okay <malay>untuk aku</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> if I want to find a partner
then I would say beauty in their personality and mindset <malay>sebab macam</malay>
(uh) for me I place I I put more I mean <malay>macam macam mana</malay> [eh] my first first
how do you say it <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) for me to identify that person as my partner in the future I would (uh) my first check list is like mindset or personality so <malay>macam</malay> ya because <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau kita</malay> (uh) <malay>kita tak</malay>
<malay>apa kita macam</malay>
we are into only the good looks then like I said <malay>macam</malay> in <malay>apa</malay> ten ten years down the road they will also age then they will no longer look the same so <malay>macam</malay> to me I will look more in terms of the long term
cause long term aspect [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> mindset and personality so <malay>macam</malay> personality and mindset is something that your bring (uh) <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] it's like since <malay>yang kau dah ada</malay> personality and mindset also so it's like how how how your personality and mindset (um) like
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] what (uh) your personality and your mindset is what attracts me most rather than your goods (uh) rather than your looks because for me I emphasize on the personality <malay>macam</malay> like for example ten years down the road [kan] <malay>kita dah macam dah kahwin semua habis kita</malay> when you have your children then like if you
don't have good personality or mindset then
ya like what's the point of the marriage ya
(um) intelligence
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(err) you groom yourself [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
(mm)
(mm)
okay (uh) firstly <malay>memang aku ada watak</malay> a lot of insecurities and low self esteem
then secondly <malay>macam</malay>
if we if you were to put me in a room where there's a lot of like pretty pretty like girls and or or we we are we like the most most like insecure person [lah]
ya that
(uh) <malay>memang</malay> high <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>dia lebih lawa</malay> [lah] [ah]
I hate
(uh)
(mm)
ya okay the
(uh)
okay no before
before we go to the next question I want to ask <malay>macam</malay>
okay okay best <malay>ke dalam</malay> topic of friendship [kan]
<malay>macam kau rasa</malay>
friendship <malay>bila kita buat kawan</malay> (uh) <malay>buat</malay>
<malay>buat kawan</malay> for the first time
do you think girls or boys place more importance on the good looks
when making friends for the first time
(mm)
(mm)
subjective [lah] also
(mm)
(mm)
to me (uh) in terms of boys or girls I would say girls <malay>sebab macam</malay>
I don't know whether boys I mean they do have insecurities and all but they place more on like <malay>macam</malay> their
practical they're quite practical
<malay>macam</malay> the friendship is base more on <malay>macam</malay>
like like you can even see like the conversation between girls and boys boys mostly <malay>macam</malay> I mean
not to generalize [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like boys they generally talk about like
(uh) <malay>apa macam</malay> like topics that are not so emotionally involved I would say ya
is
(uh) ya
comparing ya (mm)
ya better
(mm) ya should we move on
(mm)
beauty standards is it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)

(uh) yes
(mmhmm) yes
(mm) actually for that topic <malay>aku pernah</malay> [lah] <malay>belajar</malay> [lah] in <malay>aku punya</malay> course if like
(uh) if there's a term
(uh) if I'm not wrong the term is dysfunctional (um)
ya dysfunctional (um) (um) ya so it's basically like the society is not
<malay>macam</malay> what we think is a society it's not like (um) good but then it's still functioning so
(uh) it's it's rather it's rather to have that society like even though the (uh) beauty standards or the socioeconomic status is not
<malay>macam</malay> is not on the same same bar but it's still functioning so it's still called like a dysfunctional it's it's called something functional something [lah]
rather than to have a society that <malay>macam</malay> everyone is equal but then it's not functioning in terms of <malay>macam</malay> they are not hardworking or they don't have any high hopes ya
so I think ya
yes yes any ya any competition also

fashion
(uh) ya
(mm)
yes yes
<malay>lain macam</malay> extra
(mm)
okay (err) then our us okay about the fashion thingy right
(uh)
okay so now
let's move on to the fashion side so ya okay so for fashion like
okay so for fashion (um) back in those days <malay>macam</malay> nineties eighties [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> the fashion do (um) I'm not really sure because I don't live in that era but like the fashion (mm)
(err) yes based on pictures also [lah] then yes it's very laid back and <malay>macam</malay>
like I'm I'm not sure whether it's true <malay>tapi macam aku nampak dia orang macam tak terikut-ikut dengan</malay> <malay>dengan</malay> the fashion trend you know so <malay>macam dia orang tak terikut-ikut</malay> and then it's not like everyone wears the same clothes wears the same clothes types and then as compared to now <malay>macam</malay>
we have like the (uh) what the term E-boy E-girl then the (uh) then the what type of new dress <malay>macam</malay> hipster hipster so <malay>macam</malay>
I know you know I'm
(mm) hipster
ya just to fit in I would say
(mm) so <malay>macam</malay>
like do you think the
the no (um) the fashion <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] do you think the fashion style and fashion trend is more
<malay>macam</malay> is more very very common in this era as compared to eighties nineties or fifties or like do you think they are both the same regardless of the era time so <malay>macam</malay> do you see the word saturated so everyone wears the same clothes and all
okay okay can can can
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] yes social media
(mmhmm)
pinterest
tiktok yes yes yes

(mm) it's the influenza
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]

[oh] <malay>pasal</malay> journey is it
[oh] I know I know (err) if you want to go [eh] if you want to go far you go by yourself something like that ya
(mm) yes true
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
rethink
okay so (uh) okay this might be out of topic but
you were mentioning about like (um) like okay it's not really related to what you said but I think there is some relevance but you (um)
<malay>apa tu macam</malay> (um) right now (uh)
they society sees one sees an individual who is always alone
as someone who is below below societies (um)
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] (uh) so if you so the current society sees someone who cares like who does like self
care then self love and everything and someone that is very like they are an alien so because society now is <malay>macam kau ada banyak kawan</malay> then you are in a big group
then you are seen as someone who is (um) <malay>ada ada</malay> (uh) <malay>ada</malay> value [lah] then <malay>ada macam ada tempat dekat</malay> society but someone <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>dia macam apa seorang</malay>
then <malay>dia macam pentingkan</malay> not really <malay>pentingkan diri</malay> as in they know what is the what they want in life and they they have like self love and self care [lah] so like what what you think of like (um) this society standard <malay>macam</malay> ya
like being in a big group is deem as (uh) your offer value rather (uh) offer value and then for someone who is who is (um)
who is individual who is alone
(uh) seems (uh) society deems them as (uh) the weaks (err) yes the weak ones
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(um) ya
[oh]
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya
(mm)
(mm) ya
yes yes
yes ya
(mm) yes yes
(mm)
yes commitment
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
true true true
(um) okay personally because I am an introvert so it will take me very long time it will take me very long time to open up to new people [lah] especially so
our first friendship is yes yes yes
it will take a lot of years right
ya
that was <malay>jodoh</malay> [seh]
(mm)
we friends or what
seven no six set to I think you know two thousand fourteen
we <malay>ngam-ngam</malay>
it has been
roughly six years [kan]
ya
ya no beauty no standards
ya
ya
true true
(mm)
and I think for our friendship also (um) we are not that judgmental like in (uh) between ourselves so <malay>macam</malay>
ya and our friendship is focus more of like sharing and <malay>kita macam banyak</malay> advice each other so so like it's really something
ya (mm)
true okay
ya friendship ya
okay should we move on to the next question
okay (uh) okay so we have this task like
the negative side there's (uh) society standard then we share our own like experiences then now we shall like focus on beauty itself [lah] since beauty was so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada okay (uh) <malay>ada kebaikan dalam kecantikan kecantikan yang terlaung</malay>
it could !aiya!
(mm)
they got the face and the attitude right
(mm)
yes #mira filzah#
(mm)
yes yes
[oh] ya
(mm)
(mm) so it's like full package [lah] <malay>macam</malay> good looking very humble also
but
but I heard okay so that one is (um) <malay>macam kita kirakan macam</malay> (uh) role model <malay>yang macam</malay>
someone who is (err) so <malay>macam mira filzah dia macam</malay> actress [kan]
western [eh] (uh) <malay>aku tak berapa tengok</malay>
(uh)
western actor or actress
(mm)
yes yes
(um) mostly character
ya
ya
yes yes
(mm) okay then for <malay>ni kirakan kita ambil contoh dari macam</malay> (uh) <malay>pelakon penyanyi semua habis kalau macam</malay> in your own
<malay>macam</malay> those not as
those not popular [lah] so <malay>macam kawan kau</malay>
<malay>ke</malay> or like someone
you like within your family I don't know
(mm) like who who is like
a role model to you obviously
<malay>yang macam dia lawa</malay> and very like <malay>lemah lembut</malay> and all
(mm)
(mm)
(err) ya
#neelofa# isn't #neelofa# like malaysian
[oh] yes yes
(mm) yes
(mm)
(mm)
yes
it's something <malay>macam</malay>
ya it's something also like I think youth nowadays
motivation [lah] yes
(mmhmm)
ya <malay>macam</malay> (uh) [kan] <malay>cakap pasal</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
deen and deen and dunya so <malay>macam apa tu</malay> dunya means like world [lah] so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dunia tak di akhirat</malay> [lah] so
(mm)
so <malay>macam aku rasa macam sekarang</malay> like <malay>budak</malay> I mean not to generalize okay but like <malay>budak-budak sekarang</malay> is more
ya like now more of like world
<malay>aku rasa macam sebab macam</malay> singapore [kan] <malay>dia</malay> (uh) <malay>nak tinggal dekat sini memang mahal gila apa</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> the focus more ya the focus more is on like the world [lah] instead of like the the (uh) afterlife
(mm) so like I
ya so like now now now is like very rare to find like those <malay>yang macam dia ada dua</malay> [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> dunya and deen
yes
(mm)
(mm)
(oo)
yes
yes yes
(mm) true true
(mm)
so like more <malay>macam</malay> be comfortable in your own skin
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya sure okay so <malay>kita tinggal</malay> like a few more minutes [lah] so like I would should we end it off with like a one message to our future self
so like about beauty you want to share first
regret [eh] [oh] okay
(mm)
okay so <malay>aku</malay> start first [lah] so regret <malay>aku</malay> is to be the beauty standard so <malay>macam dulu</malay> (uh) secondary one primary six <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay> very (uh) very insecure [lah] <malay>sebab macam</malay>
<malay>kita ada</malay> influence <malay>dengan</malay> K pop <malay>apa</malay> so <malay>macam kita nampak</malay> !woo! <malay>macam lawa</malay> [seh] and <malay>kita pun tengok kawan kita pun macam lawa lawa semua</malay> I mean <malay>kita macam tengok diri kita sendiri macam</malay> (uh) we are not there [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> ya so like what I regret was like (uh)
like <malay>aku terlalu pentingkan</malay> like <malay>kecantikan dari luar</malay> instead of <malay>dari dalam</malay> ya
(mm) so what's your regret
[oh]
I think it'll be conflict or selfish [lah]
[oh] yes
true true true
(um) then <malay>jap</malay>
ya
like I think message something like to to remind you during your <malay>apa macam</malay> (uh) <malay>bila hari-hari yang kau perlukan kata-kata semangat</malay> [lah] I would say
so (uh) for me five years ten years down the road
(um) the priority will be (uh) <malay>ke</malay> (uh) work live and
I think pressure in terms of like <malay>macam kahwin ke tak kahwin ke macam</malay> marriage [lah] so I think
(uh) my message to be (um)
I think the pressure will be more <malay>bila kawan-kawan kau dah</malay> start to slowly get married so <malay>macam</malay> you'll feel very pressured so (um) my message would be (um)
to to emphasize to place the emphasis on your own life and and what you are you want to achieve in this world and the world after instead of looking what and not be influenced heavily by your surroundings so
it's really it's really what
your heart and your what what you really want [lah] instead of doing something that the the people around you
ask you and pressure you indirectly to do so focus more on yourself and say cause <malay>macam</malay> to to to learn to prioritise
yourself and be more selfish like easy ya
(mm)
so ya
ellen degeneres

alright thank you

<malay>akak kakak</malay> last <malay>kerja kat mana</malay>
<malay>kakak kerja apa kat situ</malay>
<malay>penat tak kerja situ</malay>
okay <malay>kak</malay> okay <malay>kalau kalau kerja kat situ</malay> [kan] <malay>apa yang akak pelajari</malay>
<malay>ada ada apa kak kerja kak ada pekerja yang susahkan benda tak</malay>
<malay>sambil kakak kerja kat kilang itu kakak ada pernah buat kesilapan apa-apa tak</malay>
<malay>jadi kiranya kakak telah belajar</malay> [lah] <malay>daripada</malay> incident <malay>tu</malay>
okay <malay>kakak sekarang mempunyai</malay> (um) experience experience <malay>di dalam bahagian industri</malay> baking (um) <malay>kalau kakak diberi pilihan untuk mencuba</malay> industry <malay>yang lain industri apakah yang kakak mahu cuba</malay>
<malay>apakah yang menginspirasikan kakak untuk mencuba mengajar</malay> (uh) <malay>kanak-kanak yang kecil</malay>
<malay>kira kakak tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>yang kanak-kanak kecil ni kadang-kadang mereka akan menjadi susah untuk dijaga mereka mungkin nangis merajuk bergaduh jadi kakak rasa kakak</malay> have the skills <malay>untuk</malay> cope with this problem
<malay>dengan adanya</malay> technologies <malay>sebagai telefon bimbit dan</malay> tablet <malay>adakah kakak rasa yang teknologi ni baik ataupun tidak baik bagi kanak-kanak muda</malay>
<malay>kakak ingat tak bila kita kecil dulu bila kita</malay> around ten years old <malay>ke</malay> eight years old <malay>gitu bila tak ada komputer semua</malay> or <malay>bila takde</malay> handphone <malay>kakak ingat tak apa kita buat dulu bila kita</malay> time <malay>kecil</malay>
<malay>kakak ingat tak dulu beza</malay> [eh] <malay>sebab dulu kita takde</malay> netflix <malay>takde</malay> youtube <malay>kita cuma tengok</malay> live and live <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> if you want to go to the toilet <malay>nak kena tunggu</malay> advertisement
then remember last time you have to <malay>apa nak kena</malay> rush the toilet <malay>kalau nak kencing ke apa ingat</malay>
<malay>sekarang senang</malay> [jer] now if you want to go toilet or what you can just pause like sometimes if like I think about it [kan] like how did we survive last time like <malay>kalau</malay> you've to watch any shows you only have we have to look at what's on the schedule we cannot watch anything we want at anytime and then also last time there's a lot of advertisement like even now
like if you think about it nowadays we have a thirty seconds youtube advertisement right like you think it's a bit <malay>susah tapi</malay> like back then advertisement on is like two minutes three minutes and like it's a lot so like it's crazy how times have changed right
I mean do you remember back then that we have to share a computer
like there's only one computer in the house then <malay>kalau</malay> if the if I want to play then he have to wait for me and then like now all of us have our phones and we can just watch our show anytime you want you can play the game on our phone anytime you want correct yes
so I mean it's I mean in a way it's a good way because we we get to experience it but I believe that like my generation we get to experience both sides like we were there when technology started to become mainstream but then at the same time we also kind of grow up
in a time where technology wasn't like the biggest part in our life like I still remember having to use the in a in the diary thing
like back then like the player is a very common thing and like there's no netflix and sometimes we don't have all the all the movies in the world so just keep watching the same shows over and over again like tom and jerry mister bean that kind of shows
and while I can't deny that nowadays things are better things are easier it's more convenient you just feel like
we will miss those days [ah] like those are good days honestly I mean like
looking back if you were to be sent back to the to the time back then we probably won't won't like it but it you know it kinda shapes us to the person that we are today and (err) the new kids the younger kids they'll never be able to experience that and I think like in a way that
it's a memory you know you you can't deny it no matter how difficult it was
so <malay>kakak</malay> remember the first phone that you got do you remember about it
so given that nowadays phones they (uh) they can be quite costly do you think that it is worth to buy like the the latest and greatest phones or is it okay to just buy a second hand phone or old phone that came out like last year or two years ago what do you think
so like if you were to buy a new phone right what are some of the things about the phone that you will look for like what are the important factors in choosing a phone for you
honestly for me [ah] I think one of the important factors if you want to buy a new phone is the battery because the phone can have the best cameras the best screen can be so fast but what is the point of having a phone if your phone's gonna die
what's the point of having a phone but everywhere you go you always have a portable charger with you with a cable like I'm pretty sure we all want to feel the one like our phone really make us feel locked down on something like the last thing we want is
to be is to feel like even more locked down by having to have a portable charger am I right
I mean like I think one of the worst case is like let's say you're on holiday and when you're on holiday you want to enjoy the moment right you want to like be able to not worry about stuff because that's the point of holidays just to relax but like
the last thing you want is to have to worry about [oh] no my phone's gonna die especially if you are like for example in singapore if your phone dies like at least you can
you know your way around like you can just go to and all that but let's say you are overseas like in malaysia then your phone die like I'm pretty sure it will be quite hard right to travel
just going back a bit talking about #johor# do you remember going to #johor#
just I think it's a terrace
ya then but
well I mean I definitely miss the old house the old old #johor# house but there are the termites problem was really I mean to be fair it's not really our main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's why there are termites come and it's honestly quite sad ya
then again that's what happen when you choose wood as your staircase cause that you know termites love the food
despite the termites I still feel like if I was given a choice I'll gladly stay in our old #johor# house it's like
it's bigger
it's just better and also like compared to when we were younger like the neighbourhood change a lot like now there's a there's a gas station there's a starbucks so like it's very different compared to how it was when we were young
I mean it's also sad because in a way like it's different things have changed but and that's how it works
so you remember where was your best place in malaysia that you like to go for holiday
ya without a doubt malaysia food is good way <malay>macam</malay>
and there's someone who live in woodlands right like going to is one of a selling point and now that we can't go to
yes it kind of sad
(mmhmm) now the closest to #johor# we can ever go to is the woodlands waterfront there and just sit down there [ah]
ya remember the first time you go to waterfront woodlands waterfront I think so
do you remember what's there and what you did
the high elements
so do you have much experience with high element obstacle courses
so other than rock climbing at (uh) #pulau ubin# what are the interesting thing interesting thing that you did during your school secondary school time
so like once you graduate from secondary school right like what are some of the major differences that you notice moving from secondary school to
so like what is like the highlight to you like what was like some of the best things you did or made or bake
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
so (um) what's the name of your lecturer who is like you know or your chef
so what do you think of him do you think he's a good chef or a good lecturer
so what are some of the thing that you wish you could have had learned that you did not
or is it anything that you wish you could have done but because of COVID you couldn't do
ya like maybe there was something that you're supposed to be able to do but because of COVID you can't do it
what are some of the thing some of the good things that that you want to continue like even after COVID nineteen is no longer a concern like some good measures or something like that
(mmhmm)
honestly I mean the hotel was it was it was not so expensive but for the price I think it was a very good deal
location wise and the hotel was very perfect like it was very near to #bugis# like literally a five minute walk to #bugis# if you look downstairs there's a vending machine that sells all kind of things and then literally two minutes away from it is a burger king
and like honestly like the price was given the location all that it was cheap the room was okay the toilet was big the bed the bed could be better honestly but at that price I wouldn't complain
and the thing is I feel like the weak part of the hotel that was the because the was like old kind of like remember our old the the one at <malay>rumah lama</malay> that kind of like the controls are very different but what what was important at the end of the day I brought my four
and ya
and and most of the time we and most of the time we just order grab food
because there were a lot of options around the area like you can choose so many things
which is why I would recommend that hotel because it's it's a very good hotel and the thing is let's say
you want to go with a larger group of friends or with your family there's actually family rooms you know that can fit like five or six people
so definitely that that it was good ya it's definitely good
I mean honestly if you if I had a choice I wouldn't want to travel around singapore because it's expensive and I've seen a lot of it ya but given that I'm limited like I wouldn't mind doing it once like
honestly like as a as a ten year old cause I was I was in primary four that was definitely one of the highlights of my primary school like it's one of the most ambitious thing I'll say like I didn't expect to be performing at the esplanade at it was like a very very good experience very new experience and like
it was a twenty two song there were it was a twenty two set list so it was about two hours plus
I mean obviously there was a break and there was like there was like a break in between and I honestly I'm I've got a surprise that
I was able to go through that because who would have thought that a ten year old kid can like perform for like two hours
so ya I mean it was a good experience definitely I just wish that there were phones back then so that finding pictures on it will be easier
but they are I mean but I mean when I was young all of us have to wear make up
and I really hated it like we have to use the blusher and we've to use the lip gloss a little bit I mean I was a kid so you know
well other than that I remember going to last year and that was the first time I took a flight
honestly it was it was it was a very short flight it was about half an hour but given that was the first time I took a plane I was a bit scared
but ya but half an hour flew by very quickly and next you are already reached and ya and I mean from school life actually travel a few a few places like I've been to hong kong I've been to #bintan#
and honestly I feel like we going overseas with your school it's kinda good and bad like while the bad thing is like the teacher will let us just go anywhere in the shopping mall but then they will give us like just two hours or something so like you'll be in a rush
like you you wish you could just spend the entire day just like going shopping seeing the mall and all that
but I think because we were kids and the teacher like it was for our safety but I'm pretty sure if we're like in
applied poly or I pretty sure there'll be more freedom
right like the teacher will let us give us more time ya
but ya but it was definitely a good experience like my hong-kong trip I did not expect to go to hong-kong cause I remember it was within the first month and our teacher said [oh] we're going to hong-kong and I was like what
where was where where where where do you where do you like [ah] we're choosing to go to hong-kong [oh] why does it usually you overseas thingy
it was it was like a exchange programme it was for geography student
ya we go there
it was only for pure geog cause pure geog was a small class it was like
a class of twenty
pure geog there's way more topics it's more hard it's it's like science
ya I know it's like it's harder there's more topics so like there's more things you need to study
honestly at this point I can't remember much but if you were to give me a test paper I'm pretty sure all the memories will come because I got A one for geography for my O level and I love geography but right now if you ask me I probably can't remember
definitely you give me you give an O level paper I will I mean the memories will probably come in I mean it's like I don't really apply it on my daily use like of course the basic things I apply it you know
like monsoon rain sea breeze land breeze all that kind of stuff tourism infrastructure but
at the end of the day I don't really use it everyday because I'm not a geologist but it's still good information to know
and like I'm honestly was either geography or literature and I just you know love geography more so ya I mean secondary school days were great and now I have fun even though it was stressful and all that stuff but it was
you managed to survive you currently I'm just I'm proud of you brother
when I was still in school I wanted to get it so much but now they have graduated I kind of miss you miss greatest because davies
was simpler so there there got so I can just gonna sleep now so

<malay>bodoh</malay>

you know how the korean pictures look like
like singapore but not singapore you know
you know I know you know
[eh] <malay>aku nanti</malay> photoshop
is it okay !duh!
(oh) okay maybe nearer ya
ya okay maybe I should show my <malay>baju</malay> a little bit
so like black and yellow black and yellow you know little bit fuck

okay like this it's so hot
okay I should try editing it with light room
[oh] look like
<malay>pelik</malay> [sia]
okay like this
should I edit it out
okay
damn sticker
(oh)
okay
okay later I will edit I will try to edit with lightroom so <malay>nampak macam</malay>
I because I I used I edit like preset on my lightroom <malay>punya</malay> account
no no need
because lightroom is technically is not like VSCO
VSCO has like
the featured presets you know ya lightroom you can created your own preset
so that is what I did
is is more like <malay>untuk</malay> photographer [sia]
but you can learn [ah] it's easy
like my picture you know my picture with someone I posted it's so I love it [sia] no that is the only picture that is H D because I used lightroom
apparently I guess like depends on how much how much filter how much (um) you edit [ah]
like your preset the <malay>macam</malay>
the higher your
your saturation (err) contrast and all that right
the worst the the quality would be I it Instagram because the more
effect that you put on your pictures in another account in another app
then when you post it on Instagram
the the resolution will be higher
so it will make it more
they will make it less
ya
that's why that's why if you when I updated pictures in VSCO right mine look nice on VSCO but then when you post the quality goes down
ya because the amount of (um) effect and then like the effect you put how high it is [ah] technically
[kan] and that's what my photographer friend said [ah] and I was like okay
it's little bit blurry right ya
ya that's that's why
I'm so tired
don't waste money
[oh] is my card with you
okay
(mm)
ya same as you right
[oh]
[eh] but if I end late
if I end like late I cannot take [what]
like if I end before eleven forty five
(mm)
but will that minus off like my pay
(oh) okay that is nice
(mmhmm)
it just enough time for me to take home [lah]
so like can I have to go back to orchard

no actually K dramas [ah] korean drama they usually end after episode sixteen
the longest it'll be twenty six or like thirty eight
right right
(hmm)
that's me that's me when I watch scarlet heart #ryeo# I was so sad ya I mean like scarlet heart #ryeo# was more than twenty episode I think
I think like twenty five or something I think so [lah] <malay>dia macam</malay> I I wanted a season two
[oh] my god it was so good [kan] then like
then like at the end they showed her going back to real world in her future world like her present modern world and then he's stuck in the old world the historical world
ya they should make like how she got back in the future world and then meet
the guy from the like reinclination of the guy and then they fall in love again or whatever
because the thing is she remembered her pass then !ee!
so annoyed ya
and the fact that she has a child in that historical world ya she gave birth then she died during childbirth
ya
and technically the <malay>anak</malay> is a princess
I mean like it's half blood
yes
technically she's the half blood [lah] because her father is the king and then the mother is like a
no
the mother is like commoner like commoner
<malay>dia punya</malay> sister the cousin-in-law is a princess then got married to another prince then after that she became like this the lady in charge of all the princess and the kings <malay>punya mandi mandi</malay> and stuff
ya you like the ya the head servant that kind and she became like that like a royal something [ah] can't remember
is a nice show
like I'm so sad

that is the thing
[kan] [oh] ya I saw
<malay>ya ke</malay>
(hmm) but then I feel like <malay>yang cina punya</malay>
drama the goals are [eh] like [meh]

[oh] you know I watch I recently watch this chinese drama my unicorn girl and then
the the lead actor was the guy from meteor garden
like the chinese the china chinese or china version I don't know [ah]

one of the guy is the lead actor of this drama I finish watching
<malay>habis macam</malay> handsome <malay>gila</malay> [sia] he's like my favourite actor [ah]
dylan I think his name is dylan dylan #chen#

<malay>kau pun sama</malay> I cannot say much about me
my jaw line is gone <malay>diam</malay> [ah] [sia]

ya like that [ah] because like they are old people I guess
but at least like the the food is nice ya it's cheap also I want to eat the fried mushroom
super nice
<malay>sedap</malay> [sia]
maybe but then it's small
i'm' not I'm not sure

staycation #thingy# ticket and the chalet you get free tickets for !wah! !wah! wet
ya and I want to go !wah! !wah! wet
ya but if you book you get free [sia]
I don't know I think hundred plus I remembered it depends on how how big you want the room to be the small the smaller room are like hundred plus per night or something like that it's quite cheap [ah] actually but I feel like it's not that worth it
because <malay>tempat dia pun kecil</malay> even at the two storey two storey room is small ya like when yo go inside the room right
you didn't have like toilet sofa balcony then you go up it's just the beds
ya so it's nothing much ya ya ya it's like it's like studio M but maybe slightly smaller I think because of the area and then more hipster
I wanna go cherry

guilty you know like I literally said sorry [eh] sorry [eh] I'm so sorry I'm so sorry about my friend they didn't even realise that then the malay malay bouncer said it's okay it's okay [dah] <malay>biasa selalu selalu macam gini</malay> then <malay>aku macam</malay> [oh] ya [sia]

but but it's true [ah] when you eat the TruFitz

school is fine but it is very boring (um) because
all of the other courses already have their holiday and
and we business school
still have not had our holiday
like
so <malay>macam</malay> very boring you know and like some more all all my other friends like we want to meet up
Y-
like from other courses [kan]
like jess all you want to meet up but then like our schedule is
very different it's like
if <malay>aku ada pagi punya kelas</malay> then she have <malay>petang punya kelas</malay> then if have if I have <malay>petang punya kelas</malay> then she have <malay>pagi punya kelas</malay> then it's like you really boring
<malay>lepas tu</malay> it's like how to say
it's very dry cause <malay>sekarang tak ada</malay> hands on cause of the COVID so <malay>kita tak ada jadi</malay> hands on activity
then I'm like central <malay>ada macam</malay>
(uh) childcare <malay>kat dalam</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi kita tak dapat pergi</malay> and we suppose to <malay>pergi</malay> so now it's like really dry and like (err) boring and all we do is like <malay>datang</malay> school [lah] <malay>habis kita tak buat apa-apa kita</malay> just do nothing we just like sit there and then we revise our own work
and then that's all so it's very boring and depressing
but then at the same time <malay>macam</malay> best <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>dapat jumpa kawan</malay> [pe]
<malay>aku suka kawan</malay>
<malay>dapat jumpa kawan habis</malay> like
we go eat together sometimes <malay>tapi macam</malay> sometimes cause <malay>semua tinggal jauh-jauh</malay> so we cannot
go eat together
then when your school start
true
(mm) ya
(mm)
(mm)
my exam start
around the same time as A level
but
because I take four modules two term five modules like including like the sports and wellness but then now like
(uh) in the because we have like college west
east right
and then (err) west and east they don't
do anymore but then college central still do but now because [ah] recently <malay>ada</malay> like COVID
case at college central so right we don't do anymore unless <malay>macam</malay> is online class <malay>tu pun</malay> online class we do like a lot of like projects like we research about the different type of sports and then we research about division of different type of muscles
<malay>habis lepas tu kita buat</malay> powerpoint slides about the muscles all [lah]
but [ah] then actually <malay>tak</malay> do like any like that is <malay>kalau kita buat macam</malay> project <malay>ni</malay> [kan]
it is counted as <malay>kita punya</malay> participation mark
like because in like
thirty percent of your
thirty percent of your overall behaviour like thirty percent is from your your behaviour
so that is considered your exam marks so like sports and wellness we count that a lot somehow like we count that a lot [lah] from the projects that we do since we cannot do like real life cause we are supposed to learn like swimming rock climbing cause they all have like their facilities there but then we now <malay>kita tak boleh buat</malay> so we don't do anymore then we have like
(um)
elementary business analytics and cyber security and and life skill is like type A module so we don't take exam for that we just take like (uh)
tests we take tests we take (uh) we do assignments we do (uh)
like stuck class task group task all and then that is our like final grade [lah] like our participation you know
like tasks and assignments in the class all and then for
I already took like test I think earlier this year cause we learn excel and then <malay>macam</malay> quite <malay>senang</malay> [lah] cause you just is given at basically it is given the answer is given like they ask you [oh] your chart must look look like you all like pivot table must look like that so it's actually given
but then cause just like you figure out how to do it so and then when we like in the weird thing [kan] <malay>pasal</malay>
each of the people can there's like (uh) over hundred like there's marks points but they don't tell you how much you get they just tell you pass or you fail and what's your final <malay>nanti kau</malay> your
<malay>kau dapat</malay> when <malay>nanti kau dapat tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay> do like well <malay>ke tak</malay> then after that for my class like [kan] you can if you fail
or you like don't do so good [kan] you have the opportunity to retake your <malay>punya</malay> like test [lah] but then my class <malay>tak ada orang</malay> retake <malay>cikgu cakap</malay> like all did like quite okay all did quite good then I was like thankfully so we <malay>dah ketepikan tu dah lama diketepikan</malay> but then project went on like for a long time
like for a really long period of time I mean module <malay>tu macam</malay> cause very frustrating cause it has nothing to do with our course which is early childhood so nothing to do [kan] so you learn a lot more to <malay>macam</malay> business more like
(um)
how we are supposed to like treat the customer then how like we supposed to like analyse data then make like
(uh) like
options and like assumptions that why the company go back that kind of is more to that kind of stuff but then like we did our project and all but she never tell us like our final mark yet then life skill is more of like presentations like how you present yourself is more of how to say <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) in <malay>macam</malay> experience through experience cause we do a lot <malay>buat macam</malay> relationship management <malay>lepas tu kita buat</malay> the time <malay>kita buat</malay> like <malay>kita punya</malay> individual presentation [kan] it just
[ah] I talk about like first
[ah] seek first to understand than to be understood is that kind of stuff is like things you learn through life [lah]
then then but we have two other modules which is business rewriting and early childhood [ah] that one is a type B module so we must do assignments like we do everything that we we do the same thing as like what we did in like
(um)
and
what's the thing
and
life skill but then like this one we have exams so we have like chapters to learn and all so our my first exam is like fourteen september and which is exam and then second exam is sixteen september so you only have two exams then after that we can go for our break
somehow we can go for our break then like they will release the result online then you look at your result online [jer] [lah] but then it's very complicated because like
we in right this is the frustrating thing [ah] <malay>cikgu</malay> just go just go through
<malay>cikgu</malay> just go through <malay>mana</malay> part <malay>yang kita nak ada buat</malay> assignment [one] <malay>dia orang tak ajar</malay> like throughout <malay>macam</malay> in secondary school they <malay>ajar</malay> everything [what] even if like those tested only a bit right they go through everything with you but then in like you need to go through it yourself and then sometimes the information and <malay>dia orang bagi pun</malay>
(uh) is not correct so you have to search online about that kind of stuff and then you have to remember like cause in early childhood is more of like you have to memorise a lot of things like <malay>kenapa budak ini nangis</malay> then <malay>kenapa</malay> [ah] <malay>dia tak</malay> [eh] separate <malay>dengan</malay> parents [jer] then (uh) what kind of symptoms
(uh) what kind of mental disorder what kind of like
(uh) mental (uh) mental disabilities is
a lot to that
so <malay>macam</malay> a bit dry it's very dry
and then
business writing is more to <malay>macam</malay> you write emails letters
(um) minutes of meeting notice of meeting taking like notes when you have meetings is
a lot of writing like one you have
in exam paper you have comprehension
section each comprehension and then you have letter email notice of meeting
and then [ah] like another one is what ya I forgot but there's another component and then you only have one hour thirty minute so you must like
very very fast like really fast
but then like there is a lot of content
then is easier in a way because <malay>ada</malay> multiple choice
so like multiple choice just do it just like pass through that get average thing
lowest mark should be like
twenty
twenty out of thirty you should get cause teachers said is like a giveaway mark but then <malay>yang</malay> section <malay>yang lain</malay> cause you have essay and all that kind of stuff so that's like the
hard part but then like
we are looking forward like (err) after finishing exam right
we are like like you said [lah] this is just semester one it feels like we have been in school for like a long time like we entered like april [oh] we entered april but like it's it's like we have been in the school for like a year then we still we forgot some if we forget that sometimes like <malay>macam</malay> how to say
we forget that sometimes it is still we're not ending our first year in december then we are ending our first year like next year april because started in april then now it's just first semester and then sometimes like when we think about it we are like
we have been this school for like so long we have been like in the first semester for so long like we do so much project we did like what five project work and so many
individual task now then you are going to take off our exam then our holiday which is only two weeks we cannot even go <malay>tak boleh pergi mana-mana sebab</malay> COVID
<malay>tak yang mana</malay> [eh] <malay>tak boleh keluar sedih</malay> and then but then like it's all like we just want to like finish the exam and get it over with cause it's
damn tiring
it's very tiring and I do not
really want to like
continue continue like this for a long period of time I just want to like two weeks break and just like go to sleep
like really let's like spend the day like sleeping I didn't even want to go out I want go out but
<malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tak boleh keluar</malay> cause <malay>mana-mana pergi tak ada duit</malay>
so <malay>mana nak pergi kalau tak ada duit</malay> [kan]
so it's just but I just want to sleep
and then like <malay>ni</malay> then can think about like other stuff
cause like now even now they are preparing us for like poly life they asking us what poly you want to go and I'm just like [oh] my god we just stay in the first semester why [ah] why you thinking about poly but then like we have to think about poly cause ultimately some of them don't want to continue this course like you can tell
but they want to <malay>tanya</malay> you to continue this course like in poly so it's very hard
(mm)
(mm)
I think like
I think we're in also same I find it hard working in teams honestly cause like I'm the type that I like to
do like I I I just like to get it over with <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>senang</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau
<malay>kalau kau buat seorang</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> like I can do <malay>bila-bila aku nak</malay> I can do any time I want and I'm the type that I want it to be like
<malay>macam</malay> I'm a I'm a bad person [lah] I that really really die die I want it to be like perfect like near perfect I want it be like
(uh)
like cause I there are I've grouped with like there is a lot of like <malay>banyak gila</malay> is the amount of like group projects right is <malay>banyak</malay> is like until like every week you <malay>tukar</malay> group you've just <malay>tukar tukar tukar</malay> constantly you <malay>tukar</malay> cause <malay>cikgu</malay> first of all like
(mm)
the reason they give is because <malay>sebab apa cikgu nak kita</malay> meet
the classmate cause we have a group like forty people
(uh)
quite a large number of people in one class forty forty one
and then secondly is
(uh)
how you
work with people they want <malay>dia orang nak tengok</malay> how
well you work with people and thirdly is like
the different opinions that people have because you are going to be somehow like you my course you are going to
be a teacher you have to work with a lot of different people in the area people cannot speak english people that cannot speak
like
people they want people can only speak chinese then people that can like
speak english or like other <malay>ada apa</malay> language from overseas then you will be sent overseas that kind of stuff so they want to see how you are
how you
<malay>macam mana kau boleh</malay> cope <malay>dengan</malay> working with other people
but then I find it very like
even
<malay>kalau aku</malay> group <malay>yang dengan kawan aku aku sangat</malay> frustrated [tau]
cause I'm the type that okay just get it over with like when you I don't cause I'm also like very noisy <malay>aku macam</malay> noisy playful naughty but when I do work I just want to do work that I I realise that's my attitude like when I doing work right I just want to like get it done <malay>macam</malay> complete [ah] <malay>cepat habis cepat kau pergi</malay> relax <malay>cepat kau pergi</malay> like
one corner <malay>kau</malay> there <malay>duduk kau boleh cikgu pun orang bila cikgu bagi</malay> time <malay>kat kelas untuk buat</malay> project <malay>kau</malay> just <malay>duduk</malay> [jer] <malay>apa habis tidur</malay>
like that kind of stuff but then like almost this semester almost like <malay>semua</malay> my project [kan] is die like <malay>hujung hujung</malay> last minute submit like [eh] but [eh] is good work [lah] we are able to provide good work but it's still
like
it's better if you can finish earlier [kan] in a sense but then
depends <malay>banyak dengan</malay> who you work with
honestly like there are people that cannot work together <malay>ada</malay> like <malay>yang</malay> they are (mm)
people it matters what my friends like girl friend but I cannot work with them like I cannot work with one guy in my classmates name #ima# cause he just talk malay cause he <malay>macam</malay> he's really a perfect
perfectionist like on
point and he has differing thoughts from mine
like where we stand [lah]
because he is the type of person that think very like
[oh] he doesn't think outside the box often
he thinks like inside a box like shoot my rules person then I'm not that kind that kind of person somehow I'm the type that I like to talk about it then like I think other ways
is that kind of thing
but then like it's very hard because like
honestly <malay>banyak orang cakap</malay> is easy in a way it depends they are some courses
<malay>banyak yang senang</malay> like
<malay>senang</malay> for you to <malay>masuk senang</malay> for you to complete <malay>senang</malay> for you to get a good grade even the teachers admit that if your classmate <malay>macam kau yang</malay> classmate #bo# #chup# like serious like
<malay>tak buat kerja</malay> [kan] I mean <malay>kau</malay> do <malay>kerja yang</malay> you are given <malay>kau boleh dapat</malay> A even though gonna work is like so bad
like because you can't I think you're other classmates don't do it you're gonna get A you want get high marks just because you did it but in my class is very competitive they're not stupid people you know they are really not stupid people like
there are people who score like eighteen
eighteen nineteen seventeen for O level they end up there just because mostly is because of math cause we are very weak in math and then early childhood <malay>pun tak ada mana kau perlu ajar</malay> math <malay>kau ajar</malay> one two three four five under ten <malay>pun sudah</malay> okay [dah] you are set for life in that career in that sense [lah]
then after that
like because of that guy and people tend to look down so <malay>macam</malay>
some people come into our class thinking that come to thinking that okay this is going to be easy right cause gives a lot of the scholarships
scholarships and more [lah] a lot of like opportunities for students
but then <malay>macam</malay> what they never think is that
our class is my class it's very competitive like
really competitive you know like the other type that <malay>macam</malay> every lesson <malay>ada soalan</malay> every lesson <malay>ada soalan</malay> every lesson <malay>ada</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> [oh]
they like the <malay>macam</malay>
they really think about their ranking a lot [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I know that some <malay>macam</malay>
my friend sawar she hasn't really think about ranking [lah] but she's clever but #rela# also clever but she also don't think about ranking <malay>macam kita</malay>
sorry to say but <malay>melayu</malay> more relax [lah]
<malay>kita macam</malay> more like okay <malay>tak apa kalau</malay> pass pass <malay>kalau</malay> fail fail <malay>gitu tapi</malay> we try hard
<malay>tapi macam</malay> there are a lot more other races <malay>macam</malay> they are very keen on
<malay>macam</malay> competing <malay>macam</malay> hardcore <malay>gila ni semua</malay> [kan] so to me there's no maybe is going at a slower pace than poly because what we are learning is what year ones are learning [ah] but we are learning it break we break up
like a lot of the things we learn like more like less
more slower in a sense <malay>kita boleh</malay> more slow but
even that for even for me that is very hard cause like to adapt
to being in like (uh)
like secondary school
because I'm used to like I'm the type of person like in secondary school <malay>macam aku dah</malay> fail fail fail fail fail <malay>lepas tu bila kat</malay> the end <malay>aku macam</malay> okay pass <malay>macam</malay> I made it <malay>jelita</malay> [bah] cause I I do set expectation that are high
but
at the end I produce like good results but then now like
in it's all about okay every time must be good results and it's like the pressure is mounting up <malay>macam</malay>
I <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> very like less freedom cause like continuously like okay everyday I have assignments submit by this submit by that submit by this like even though like I have more assignments than some of my even poly friends like they are more chill they relax actually
<malay>senang</malay> [jer] <malay>macam gitu</malay> then I'm just like [oh] my god why is this so stressful I was like cause I think that was my mistake
<malay>aku</malay> go into thinking that <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>senang</malay> like <malay>ni</malay> like it will be <malay>nak</malay> very easy
it will be like very like easy right
but anyway I was inside already like first two weeks first week of school it kill me like okay because no orientation because you straight go into our assignment which drove me like crazy I was like okay I need to find a kid I need to find a kid <malay>takkan</malay> tell me <malay>budak tapi tak nak</malay> observe <malay>budak tu lepas tu</malay> I <malay>nak tanya</malay> write report <malay>pasal budak tu</malay> then I'm just like [oh] my god I cannot do this
I'm like then my friend is from early childhood poly then she is like
(uh)
but <malay>dia orang ingat</malay> like <malay>macam ni senang</malay> cause <malay>kau jaga budak</malay> [jer] [pe] <malay>kau jaga budak kau budak tu mak dia tinggalkan budak tu kat kau habis kau jaga jaga</malay> but actually
we watch how the <malay>budak</malay> grow
like how he is doing cause sometimes <malay>cikgu yang</malay> responsible for like the early childhood of the child the more the responsible is to see if there's a problem with your child developmental wise cause by certain age
like you know we grow up right we grow up knowing nothing then <malay>kita</malay> okay just <malay>besar macam</malay> okay [lah] by this age <malay>dah cakap</malay> actually there's a
guidelines for how certain age you're supposed to like talk by what age you are supposed to talk by what age you need to walk then that kind of stuff but we have to memorize that kind of stuff then we talk about the brain like temporal frontal lobe
the parietal lobe then I'm just like [oh] okay then was like in unit what unit six that we learn about that kind of stuff and then when I look back I'm just like
[oh] my god
[oh] I look back my slides right I'm learning [ah] I'm like <malay>tengah</malay> revise [jer] <malay>aku macam apa yang aku tengah belajar ni apa kena mengena ni dengan budak-budak</malay> and we revise okay that's actually link <malay>kita belajar pasal</malay> brain then <malay>kita faham</malay> okay which <malay>budak pakai</malay> which part of the brain when they are doing this <malay>budak pakai</malay> then we are just like [oh] my god we are just learning like
same things as like a normal teacher do like all all is linked somehow then it becomes like
when you realise that how hard
that this is gonna be right cause from the
seniors <malay>mereka cakap</malay> from the first year
<malay>kau boleh tahu</malay> how hard it's gonna be for the next year
then it's obviously <malay>kau dah tahu</malay> like you are like
damn
this is gonna be hard and then [ah] I'm like I'm not even in poly that's the thing
<malay>macam</malay> it is and there are some poly kids they go into early childhood in poly [eh] <malay>tak tahu apa-apa</malay> they don't know anything about <malay>budak-budak</malay> you don't know anything like
some people even like <malay>masuk</malay> early childhood they don't even like kids that much cause it's just early childhood is how <malay>macam</malay> early childhood has
not a lot of paths for you to go
so end up you <malay>jadi cikgu atau jadi</malay> principal more of that but then
it it is a very stable job cause obviously that job is not gonna that job cannot be taken by robots that kind of stuff so it is a very stable job everybody's gonna like end up like being a teacher so <malay>macam</malay> that stability is what people want in life [kan]
<malay>dia orang nak duit dia orang nak macam ni</malay> but that they don't pay a lot they don't really pay a lot you know in the sense that they do not pay a lot but the stability that
you know that
for the next few years <malay>kau ada</malay> job <malay>untuk dapatkan</malay> they focus on that then a lot of my classmates they want to go university there are already thinking even up when they start thinking okay <malay>aku nak pergi</malay> uni from my mind is like okay I know I'm in but do you want to go to uni
or you want to sign contract with and just work for a few months
(uh) for a few years and like
I want to I don't know initially <malay>memang aku nak baca</malay> psychology
cause that's what I want to learn [what] since my points didn't get me to achieve that but then now that I have the opportunity [kan] I just want to go for like child psychology
that how a child thinks it can further my career in a sense but it's also what I'm interested in but I haven't decide <malay>macam belum</malay> decide <malay>kalau aku nak kerja ke atau aku nak sekolah macam</malay> I'll pass <malay>macam</malay> how to say [ah]
I don't know somehow like girls are better at planning their paths
like I is no shade to guys there's not shade but we think about the future a lot which is like overthinking [lah] we think about the future a lot but like okay is this gonna be like
a smooth journey what am I going to do next like the thing won't even come don't even bother and I'm thinking about uni I know that I want to go to
poly obviously I <malay>aku tak nak</malay> just stop at like I want to learn more there's a lot more things that I can learn at poly I know that and then
<malay>apa tu</malay>
my friend said that in every like I was <malay>macam</malay> very when <malay>dapat pergi</malay> [kan] you are very saddened at the fact that you go cause when your end goal is poly but then my friends said that <malay>apa tu</malay> once in your lifetime you must experience life
cause it's a very even on twitter you are like [ah] you guys look down on but then like you must experience that cause it's fun it's really like fun it's like secondary school but upgrade
cause now people are more mature so like less drama and just small fun and then you get along with everybody everybody is like
like everybody like is that kind of stuff and you will have a lot of things do but <malay>sekarang</malay> COVID so <malay>kita tak ada buat semua tu tapi</malay> we still have like
like just a few week days ago last week we like before our exam like our teacher brought like some snacks and she brought she <malay>bawa</malay> nintendo switch [jer] <malay>pergi</malay> class [ah] <malay>semua orang main</malay> just dance is like that kind of thing
you know it's very fun but then like obviously now
all of us want to go poly <malay>semua nak pergi</malay> poly <malay>kita punya</malay> ultimate goal is poly
cause first of all we never when teacher first cause when you first enter [kan]
<malay>macam bila kau kat</malay> first day
<malay>dia orang tanya kau</malay> like (um)
what do you want what is your achieve what do you want to achieve
and where is your next step that is what
they asked and like we go around the room
then like I think about like ninety percent not hundred percent said they want to go poly and then you see okay #ngee ann# #temasek# #ngee ann# #temasek# that kind of stuff [bah] <malay>banyak orang cakap dia nak pergi</malay> twenty percent want to pursue uni psychology
so like we already we all have our own end goal this is where we stop that kind of stuff
<malay>macam susah tapi</malay> that
<malay>bila aku tengok semakin aku cakap</malay> okay <malay>memangnya</malay> it's gonna be hard cause there's so much people there's forty people in this room but then like
when you go uni you fighting with secure spot obviously they are clever people then you fighting if with poly which is clever people you don't know who yet there is no saying that is not clever but we are slower in learning pace
that's obviously true [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>susah</malay> then I see you learn by <malay>laju</malay> so <malay>aku dah macam</malay>
[oh] my god I cannot take this <malay>aku macam dah</malay> stress I remember [ah] me thinking that when I do my assignment like [oh] my god is already so stress <malay>aku dah</malay> stress <malay>gila masa buat</malay> assignment <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> like sometimes <malay>kalau kau</malay> message <malay>aku aku tak reply apa-apa aku</malay> just <malay>macam</malay>
I cannot do this <malay>aku tak boleh aku tak boleh aku nak</malay> focus like I not everybody when like it's my assignment I just like do my work
that kind of stuff I think
I I realise at certain point if is this hard
how am I supposed to adapt into poly I mean the transition <malay>macam</malay> I think <malay>itu yang susah</malay> transitions to secondary and tertiary life cause it's
totally opposite cause in <malay>kat</malay> [ah] secondary school all these are the teacher <malay>untuk</malay> guide <malay>kau</malay> like okay <malay>kau nak buat ni kau nak buat ni</malay> okay <malay>kau nak</malay> submit [kan] <malay>ni kau nak</malay> submit [kan] <malay>tu</malay> in <malay>kalau kau tak nak</malay> submit <malay>cikgu macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kenapa kau tak buat</malay> submit
[ah] <malay>kau nak</malay> submit [tau] next time <malay>tapi dia dia orang tak</malay> remind <malay>kau</malay> they don't remind you they didn't like teach you everything in that okay <malay>ada</malay> exam make sure <malay>belajar tu</malay> [jer] <malay>aku macam</malay> what the hell <malay>aku macam</malay> come on man like
that is the shock and then I think
adaptation is how you are [ah] adapt let me [ah] I think most people <malay>tak nak</malay> it's understandable <malay>kalau kau tak nak</malay>
go to poly after
cause <malay>kalau kau dah</malay> badly adapt poly right <malay>kenapa tu</malay> like you <malay>kau tak macam</malay> you cannot get used to
it's gonna be hard in poly cause poly is more like tough
<malay>macam</malay> I know [ah] focus a lot in group work
also I think everyday every thursday is our presentation day every thursday then now change every day like every assignment like <malay>macam cikgu ajar</malay> one chapter okay by next by tomorrow submit your slides then by this day we gonna present
then we just one person do then everybody speak out like now my group has become like usually we it's a group work but now it's like I do the slide and I just separate the part
<malay>macam</malay>
I cannot I think that's the thing I need sufficient time to study I'm the I'm a very slow learner [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you have to admit I'm a very slow learner I'm good at language language <malay>macam</malay> mother tongue
language I am okay with it but I'm more to english in a sense cause
in early childhood if you get at least a
if you get C five right you have to retake
your english you need to at least get a B somehow because language is very important <malay>macam</malay> but then now they are making like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] mother tongue <malay>punya</malay> base preschool <malay>semua</malay> [kan] but it's still english very important
cause like at one point you realise that a lot of your learning is due to rephrase the words <malay>macam</malay> there are some things about [ah] what we learn about like theory psycho analytic theory this kind of stuff is where there's super ego and then like ego that kind of stuff is where we learn how like you know like there's <malay>macam kat</malay> movie
like <malay>macam</malay> devil and angel right that's like a real theory and then we learn okay how it affects children
<malay>punya</malay> like thinking how they make decisions <malay>macam mana</malay> then <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>budak ni</malay>
like ego is what
like is like <malay>macam</malay> evil not evil [lah]
is what you truly desire then how to say super ego is the one that influence you to make good decisions in ego is the one that is making the decisions so these two person are just influencing then <malay>macam</malay> [ah] when we realised that it's hard <malay>macam susah</malay>
serious <malay>susah bila aku kat muka sekarang kadang-kadang hujung</malay> just <malay>tidur</malay> I cannot take it <malay>aku macam kelas pukul lapan</malay> we start at eight and we finish at five and it's back to back classes I don't have a lot of breaks in my class how could I text I don't have a lot of breaks
<malay>kita</malay> back to back classes
then you get very tired get very tired and you there's more information that can go inside your brain then when you go back home right you <malay>macam</malay> I think the
good thing about I don't want to say good thing about COVID it but the great thing about online learning is you record a lot or your lecture
<malay>macam kau punya</malay> record <malay>senang kau</malay> record like how to say that time <malay>aku</malay> the whole way <malay>aku tidur</malay> like it was like two hour class I just sleep the whole way through I off my camera and off my mic then I slept
then but I still there was assignment given at the end of your lesson then I was like
okay now I have to do assignment but I didn't learn anything cause I (uh) sleeping
then there always there's someone in the class that always record and send it to the group so that's a good things so <malay>aku tengok balik</malay> recording okay <malay>macam</malay> okay now we have to mix and match that kind of stuff <malay>macam</malay> keeping <malay>balik</malay> cause it's very hard to concentrate online class
it's no matter how like late your class is right I just sleeping is like more better like <malay>kau tidur jeng kau nak nanti kau bangun kau cakap</malay> okay fine
it's a good day but then it's like
it's just seriously hard [oh] you know <malay>macam</malay> now is
eighteen it's not such a young age but it's not such a old age either it's in the middle there at least [eh] there are people that want to get married you know marriage is like (ugh)
older and more responsibility in a sense
now like <malay>macam</malay> honestly okay at eighteen right [ah] when I turn eighteen of my birthday I did a video call with my friends
and then [ah] one of
I have a older friend right #aqilah# [kan] a year older then <malay>dia</malay> she tell me <malay>macam tegur aku</malay> [lah]
at eighteen you find out a lot about yourself
what kind of person you are yourself discovery journey is eighteen what kind of person you are what
what kind of people you want to mix around with <malay>kalau orang mana yang kau mahu dekat dengan</malay>
who is your real friends who is your friends and who is just your acquaintance these three groups of people
cause <malay>biasalah</malay> cause in like in religious terms we cannot cut out anybody but still
and then she say then you realise are you a relationship person or are you not
like how are you coping with your relationship it cause like
<malay>macam</malay>
and eighteen [kan] <malay>kau</malay> obviously <malay>kawan kau bukan semua ada</malay> boyfriends [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> [jer] [kan] [oh] <malay>ajak kawan ada</malay> they're going out <malay>dia orang keluar kat</malay> boyfriend <malay>dia orang lepas tu dia orang</malay> go to the beach even <malay>kat</malay> COVID COVID <malay>ni dia orang</malay> text <malay>sahaja</malay> it's just like (ugh) I want that I want that but there's no one to have that with but I want that
then like it's how you deal with that situation <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kau nak</malay> boyfriend <malay>tapi kau tak dapat kau nak buat apa</malay> are you gonna be like sad but I mean now I I don't know I'm not sad I'm more like okay [lah] <malay>kau tak ada</malay> boyfriend
that's why I relax <malay>macam</malay> okay now I realise you know <malay>macam</malay> ninety percent of my friends that you <malay>macam</malay>
my close friend [lah] <malay>macam kau aqilah</malay> megan they prioritise studying over anything else they prioritise like how to say like or guys studies
I would choose studies [lah] if a guy said I want you to stay home when you get wraps up
no I'm not marrying you (uh) I want to like I want to have like education I want to work I want to travel the world
that kind of stuff and then the I realise maybe #hada# you know she has <malay>macam ada</malay> boyfriend <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan]
she
don't cause she wants she said after she graduated [ah] she want to take one year break
just
she want to take one year break then I'm like that's a long time bro one year of your life what you gonna do but then I also respect
cause taking a break is something that
takes a lot of decision [tau] cause <malay>kau</malay> one year <malay>kau nak pergi mana kawan kau semua nak</malay> moving along with your life [what] <malay>dia orang tengah kerja dia orang tengah belajar dia orang tengah</malay> getting (uh) upgrading yourself in a way [lah] then <malay>kau nak</malay> you won't have a lot of people to spend time with you
<malay>betul tak</malay> unless you have boyfriend [lah] but then your boyfriend also studying then what you gonna do
NAFA is poly after she finish NAFA she graduate
she can work she is basically a college
it's different <malay>ke</malay> so it's college [lah] so she can work after NAFA but she wants take a break
cause me megan <malay>aqil kita</malay> plan <malay>lagi</malay>
<malay>ke</malay> korea <malay>belajar</malay>
[kan]
you know you can join us you know cause you know what megan me and #aqil# are going there for
(err) early childhood cause their programme that early childhood is very strong and then megan is going there for science like food science I think you can go there then we can all get a
apartment stay together it's gonna be so much fun but #hada# don't want to go
then we're just like come on #hada# then she just said <malay>kita tak nak</malay>
<malay>apa tu kita tak nak</malay>
she she doesn't <malay>kita tak nak</malay> how to say <malay>dia nak</malay> take a break <malay>dia tak nak</malay> continue <malay>belajar</malay> cause I don't think she prioritise
studying a lot
she more prioritise experience and I kind of understand that
(mm)
there's no right or wrong
in a sense there's no right or wrong but it's just that there's people more like
we we are scared to admit but ya we are we we would choose our education over guys <malay>kita macam</malay> okay <malay>kita macam</malay> single <malay>sedih</malay> [kan] cause <malay>sedih tak ada</malay> boyfriend
<malay>semua</malay>
<malay>sedih dan lain-lain</malay> but
if a guy tells me that my biggest turn off in a guy [kan] is <malay>bila dia bilang aku</malay> [jer] [tau] <malay>dia tak tahu apa nak buat</malay> into the future
I don't like <malay>aku macam</malay> god you need a plan dude you plan your life you need
to get a job you need to like come on like <malay>dia nak kena</malay> get <malay>dia</malay> life straight I like I find guys like <malay>macam tahu</malay> what they are doing in life right very attractive first
you don't want them who struggle in a sense
ya I feel
(mmhmm) it's like
<malay>susah kalau nak</malay> like okay (mm) we are young so we are supposed to experience a lot of stuff we <malay>macam</malay> get it [lah] but then <malay>macam</malay> we
there's no such thing as no free no care like to me in singapore right your education really somehow determine
who you are in life you know <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>sekarang ni</malay> school decision (um) <malay>aku selalu cakap</malay> [tau] [oh] <malay>tapi</malay> some people doesn't mean determine who we are who you are [oh] I'm like
that's that's total like
ya that's total like a lie like we all know it determines who we are as a I'm always like every
year right at the end of every year right
like cause my okay my my parents in a sense they don't really <malay>macam</malay> put pressure sometimes they do but I kind of understand but top that
I can understand why they put pressure cause we talk
and then but the but then <malay>macam</malay> to me [kan] the
the <malay>aku punya</malay> pressure towards myself is <malay>lebih besar</malay>
so at the end of day [kan] I'm scared of the disappointing myself you know because <malay>macam kau</malay> already
like like
<malay>macam</malay> let's say I <malay>aku ada</malay> a lot of thing spent <malay>untuk diri aku aku ada</malay> like a lot of
plans like of like timeline I have a timeline of my life what I want to accomplish like I don't have my dad already set by twenty five then can bring back home guy
bring back home you don't get married you know bring back home guy so I have like (ugh) and then now what another like
nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five
seven years to find my one but then like I don't focus on that
like cause now
I actually single best <malay>gila sebab kau</malay> first of all <malay>aku boleh tidur pukul berapa aku nak</malay>
like <malay>aku boleh tidur pukul sembilan pukul lapan siang</malay>
<malay>kau tidur kau lambat aku balik ke rumah kau lambat pagi</malay>
<malay>tak ada orang nak bisingkan aku</malay>
yes
the crying no non-stop
that kind of thing
the cry non-stop right then but then
to me I don't know in a sense right
<malay>aku</malay>
how to say <malay>aku tak sangat</malay>
like okay I want
a boyfriend but then
<malay>aku tak nak lelaki yang macam</malay> sticks around all the time
I don't like that I don't like <malay>macam macam</malay> I have seen a lot of my friends <malay>banyak bagi tahu aku apa</malay> everyday <malay>kau</malay> everyday <malay>jumpa</malay>
<malay>macam kau</malay> okay <malay>kau tak ni macam kau tak rimas kau aku tengok kau aku rimas</malay> [tau]
<malay>macam</malay> I cannot cause I have I like hanging out with my friends I like hanging out with my friends I like doing things like cause like [ah] you know I'm crazy right when I watch something I binge watch it like then I can watch like five episode of like criminal minds in one day then I'm like (ugh) like come on like that crime the passion you know that kind of stuff but then like how to say like
somehow
when I realise can
like how to say [ah]
<malay>bila kau dah seorang</malay> [eh]
<malay>kau ada banyak</malay> freedom you know <malay>kau</malay> you can do a lot of things because now <malay>banyak</malay> of my friends that break up they are like [oh] my god
single is fun but after two months they're like [oh] my god I can't believe you have been single for two years then <malay>aku macam aku tak nak</malay> [kan] <malay>saya lelaki aku macam</malay> [ah] you know <malay>macam</malay> my life has been fun all this while
I feel like even if <malay>kalau aku dalam</malay> relationship [kan] I would take it very slow
I'll be like you focus on your life I focus on my life
we'll see where it goes [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
cause obviously <malay>aku nak</malay> date for long term
I mean like
even with my ex I didn't know you know despite all the off and ons right we dated for like what
two years two years and half like that's a long time
like that's a pretty long time [lah] but then like then you realise at the end already right
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa kau nak</malay>
<malay>apa yang kau nak</malay> in life like is it a need or is it a want
I feel I I want a boyfriend but I'm not gonna die if I don't have it cause I'm fine now like <malay>aku tak ada</malay> boyfriend [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
how I am
most of last most of my last time my friends <malay>ada</malay> contact [kan] can go back with <malay>aku akan</malay> text <malay>macam balik punya</malay> [eh] ya <malay>aku balik macam</malay> but then when [ah] I go back home alone
I feel fine <malay>apa</malay> I feel like okay I'm fine I can sleep bro <malay>tak ada tak ada orang cakap dengan aku aku</malay> [jer] <malay>tidur</malay> [jer] <malay>janganlah aku tidur aku boleh tengok</malay> tiktok like the whole way home I'm just watching like tiktok and nobody disturb me
that kind of stuff <malay>kalau aku nak pergi aku lapar aku nak pergi makan</malay>
then I'm just I just call my friend that okay <malay>kau nak</malay> you <malay>nak makan tak</malay> the I the best thing is <malay>aku tak payah minta</malay> not <malay>minta macam aku tak payah macam</malay>
like worried <malay>keluar dengan kawan lelaki</malay> boyfriend <malay>aku macam marah</malay> [eh] <malay>kenapa keluar dengan lelaki</malay> like I can be friends with whoever I want like literally like no doubt you are free but in a sense <malay>bila kau dah</malay> free for too long
you have a lot of happiness in you
<malay>tunggu macam</malay> how to say [ah]
because my friends say you number one when you break up [eh]
first of all you learn to love yourself back <malay>kenapa macam</malay> cause girls highly like not just girls even boys sometimes <malay>bila dia orang</malay> break up [eh] <malay>dia orang kena</malay> dump they think that <malay>macam</malay> somehow [ah] what's wrong with me <malay>berapa muka soalan kau</malay> [kan] #tang# is like <malay>kenapa aku</malay> then you have to over that
like time where you like okay <malay>aku ni</malay> okay actually it's just everyone around me that's shit
like that's not good
it's but [ah] then you get get okay can be there then you just like I'm fine I'm the greatest person then you
spend that that days like okay I'm actually that good and you focus on yourself
<malay>kau</malay> just <malay>macam</malay> build up on yourself [lah]
that's what I've been doing for the past like two years I think I beat up a lot of myself I'm like the
like I think this year
changed me a lot
somehow COVID [kan]
I now I know like who I want to be friends with
like during this period of time now I know who I want to be close with like I have you I have like the other girls I have like even #raziq# sometime although he's gone most of the time I try to understand cause you never know what's going in a
person's life like there is a lot of things that
<malay>aku faham</malay> [ah] in a way and then
I would say that the start the twenty twenty the start of twenty twenty january #imelda# is different from
september #imelda# now in the sense cause I'm more like
okay because I feel like I've been like living my life
cause <malay>fikir banyak pasal orang sibuk sangat pasal orang tapi tak fikir sendiri sendiri</malay>
you know that kind of thing
then <malay>bila</malay> now I'm thinking like at the end of the day <malay>kau seorang</malay> [jer] during this pandemic I spend a lot of time [jer] I think I spend the most time with you during the pandemic
we talk a lot less spend then second most is like with the girls the other girls then third is #raziq#
like I is mostly because I spend a lot of time with family and that's the best thing you know cause they can
like <malay>bila aku dengar</malay> anything I have this habit of like using my phone even when with my family cause <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>nak</malay> text all the time then <malay>sekarang macam</malay> I like brother and my sister they were sick [ah] what earlier this year so when they go out they always don't want to be ask like
so they always want to have private they want to call girlfriend malam</malay> call boyfriend calling <malay>ni kau tu</malay>
family is important to me <malay>macam</malay> I think because I grew up
me and my siblings grew up separately so we all came together [kan] <malay>kita macam</malay> really emphasise my dad my dad really like
appreciates family time a lot like he really loves I think when I was in sec actually [ah] I hangout a lot with my friends like sec four I can talk a lot with them
then I realise like how
how happy I was when I was with them thing <malay>macam</malay>
my family is a type <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau nak faham</malay> like <malay>kawan</malay> friendship <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> is not
anytime <malay>boleh</malay> end
<malay>walaupun kau rapat kadang-kadang</malay> [eh]
<malay>kau boleh</malay> end [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> family <malay>kau</malay> will always be there with you and you need to understand because <malay>kau dah besar</malay> you are adult
adult you know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>aku sekarang</malay> I'm eighteen right you don't stop me but I still ask their permission when I want to go out like can I do this can I do that I still ask permission and they still like I don't mind sometimes my mum used to have this family link like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] she she like how to say
checks up on our like
(uh) she checks up on like our locations
then she check up on our like
(uh)
location [ah] phone <malay>kita</malay> like she can switch off she can like switch off our phone
like with with her phone she can switch off our phone like time in time out but then like
but then like but the way you have to install it cause she recommended my mum have a best friend right she recommend it to her friend but her friend was not happy her friend was like <malay>kenapa kau nak</malay> lock phone <malay>aku macam</malay> that kind of vibe you know then <malay>bila kita</malay> the way my mum install it on our phone right
my mum just <malay>macam</malay> how to say
my mum just like [ah] give me touch you <malay>punya</malay> phone
then <malay>kita kena bagi</malay> like my siblings just like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>tanya</malay> like they never ask
<malay>aku aku</malay> reply <malay>aku macam kalau mak aku minta aku</malay> phone I <malay>aku macam tak tanya aku macam tak ada benda nak</malay> hide
I have nothing to hide so <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>bagi</malay>
then my brother my brother would ask a lot of question
<malay>kenapa main kenapa</malay> cause he's always playing game
so <malay>dia macam</malay> very agitated [tau] so <malay>macam</malay>
but then we will give and she just download it and she just install it we didn't even know
and then <malay>macam kita dapat balik kita macam</malay> okay and <malay>lepas tu</malay> she lock our phone like at certain times and when we want to download stuff you have to ask her that was in sec five you know cause it was last year
that wasn't like what <malay>tu bukan masa aku muda-muda</malay> [tau] <malay>tu</malay> last year [tau] #sasha# knew about this like <malay>apa tu</malay>
and then after that she always like lock <malay>kita punya</malay> phone <malay>semua</malay> [kan] then <malay>habis tu</malay> when family time she lock off [kan] I was like but we don't ever feel <malay>macam</malay>
I don't ever feel personally I don't feel angry
cause like and <malay>macam kalau</malay> you
that app [kan] <malay>kalau kau pakai</malay> more than eight hours [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> lock <malay>kau punya</malay> phone <malay>tu kau tak boleh buka</malay> so maximum is eight hours I've never gotten my phone lock cause <malay>aku sahaja</malay> I spend a lot of time with my family and my friends
I spend <malay>tak tau</malay> it charge charge <malay>semua pasal kita</malay> just <malay>macam</malay> bond <malay>banyak-banyak</malay> bond
in a sense [lah]
so <malay>macam aku</malay> I never had that problem
and my sister had more for a few times and then she was okay with it <malay>kita tak pernah marah kita macam bila</malay> app <malay>tak ada</malay> [kan] then we understand now <malay>kenapa</malay>
cause
naturally now [kan] <malay>kita</malay> spend a lot of time together a lot <malay>kita tak</malay> on the phone <malay>kita macam</malay> I say to my mum
[ah]
I have to sleep early today then I don't watch movie like this year during the COVID we watch like the whole harry potter series as a family like every night <malay>kita</malay> watch the harry potter series as a family <malay>macam</malay>
we just like (uh)
(uh) like at eight after my that eight [eh] like all on my <malay>apa dia</malay> off day <malay>kita</malay> just <malay>duduk habis kita tengok</malay> harry potter like <malay>kami pun tu nangis nangis hujung gila pun macam kau orang mati macam</malay> it's that kind of vibe you know then <malay>macam</malay> but when I spend a lot of time with cousins [kan] I realise that their families are different
<malay>macam</malay> they don't really <malay>tak kisah sangat pasal</malay> family <malay>dia orang</malay> say
okay <malay>aku dah besar</malay> [pe] okay like now what eighteen
<malay>kenapa nak</malay> spend a lot of time with family
cause
<malay>shazlin dia</malay> family <malay>tak pakai baju raya dia</malay> matching [tau]
<malay>dia beli baju raya sendiri duit dia dia beli</malay>
<malay>dia beli sendiri</malay> so <malay>pakai</malay> different colour [ah] but my family is like every year like we sit down and we talk about it was like my sister always want pink [eh]
my brother always want blue then my dad want black but we'll always decide okay <malay>satu</malay> colour [jer]
then we buy like same colour and it same with <malay>macam makan</malay> [tau] like it's like <malay>puasa</malay> right we all like put
our suggestion in a bowl then that she picks up every day then she read out then she's like okay today I pick out like we do that every year but we do never complete cause every night [ah] last day usually last week [kan] <malay>kita banyak makan</malay> take out like my dad will bring us all out we had that tradition then <malay>bila aku macam</malay> spend a lot time <malay>macam</malay>
with other people and <malay>aku</malay> realise like I'm lucky in a sense that way cause my family is very close
but [ah] same to me [ah]
(mm) cause is I think my family is like that you know then you know the one good thing is we don't hide anything from each other
naturally when I had boyfriend I tell my mum and my dad actually they don't
they <malay>dia orang tak macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia orang tak macam</malay> forbid
but they are like they advise you need to understand they my mum always told me my mum always <malay>cakap</malay> why do you want to have a boyfriend you are so much more you want accomplish why do you want to be tied down
that kind of stuff cause the guys that I date tie me down
a lot so <malay>macam</malay> my mum is like don't want do that then I just talk to them freely like if I have even friends' problem I talk to my mum very freely I talk to my dad then my dad give me advice even education like <malay>macam</malay> every time I'm moving on to another school or another part of my life I always I always discuss with them I'm I want to do this

okay alright
let's move to the
let's check a topic
I definitely eat <malay>rendang</malay>
yes
cause
<malay>rendang</malay> actually that's a good question why <malay>tau</malay> because
I <malay>selalu makan rendang</malay>
when
<malay>hari raya</malay> but then <malay>mak mak</malay>
<malay>mak</malay> always <malay>masak</malay> like anytime she wants
so when she everytime <malay>masak</malay> I everytime <malay>makan</malay> and I love the taste of <malay>rendang</malay>
so I <malay>makan</malay> everyday [ah]
and like you know I have I've ever gone
<malay>dua bulan makan rendang</malay> straight
not really [ah]
no
no you have to switch the carbohydrates around so for example if I were to eat
rendang with rice today
maybe for my breakfast example then maybe <malay>petang makan</malay> with <malay>roti</malay> then <malay>malam makan dengan</malay> noodle
<malay>faham</malay>
yea
ya [lah] <malay>ketupat</malay> is the best [lah] definitely
you put <malay>serunding</malay> !oof!
everything also you don't like
okay what about you what's the food that you would eat
!huh!
what
why
[oh] okay
actually <malay>kari ayam pun boleh makan dengan</malay> noodles and like
with
nice what
no actually when you go
when you go outside you know those chinese stall
that sells curry noodle
it's nice
why
excuse me
you had <malay>lemak cili api</malay> pasta
pastas are noodles what
it's still noodle [what]
besides
you know the
#lanzhou# beef noodle
the ya the beef noodle beef noodle
yes !oof!
can have that everyday
yeah yeah tougue tip yeah [oh] my god
you know just now
tender
<malay>sendu sendu apa</malay>
<malay>sedap je</malay> [lah] <malay>cakap</malay>
<malay>pekat</malay>
<malay>sendu lain</malay> [lah]
<malay>sendu lain seru pun lain</malay>
but
the what reason
pettiest
(mm)
I
I can't think of one yet you go on first
[oh] my god is that your
<malay>macam</malay> step know it all [ah]
<malay>kan</malay>
<malay>kirakan</malay> the big shot [ah]
actually I I cannot I cannot stand
people <malay>yang</malay> ego
they are like
how I say [eh]
they
well I had the answer in my mind but I don't know how to phrase it into a sentence but someone
like you know how some guys
they wanna show that they're the men in that room
or they wanna show that they're the alpha
and ends up they're actually a freaking beta
no [lah] I mean like I'm just saying like
you don't have
to put up
a show to prove to everyone else in that room that you're the lion on the mountain
you know
so <malay>macam</malay>
I just can't stand <malay>kalau orang nak macam nak</malay> step <malay>besar</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> step <malay>orang yang nak</malay> step I really just cannot
<malay>kirakan dia</malay> champion [ah] <malay>kirakan dia</malay> champion
ya so like
(uh) actually
more better <malay>lebih baik</malay>
<malay>bodoh</malay>
well yeah yeah
okay
let me see
[ah] this is interesting
if if humans no longer need
needed to work to survive what would we do
<malay>astaghfirullah</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya capitalism is an issue
I
it consumerism yes
I I feel like I'm on this
on the fence on this question
because
first thing if there's nothing to work on in life
then <malay>hidup tak ada</malay> objective
<malay>tak ada makna</malay> ya because for example if someone
right now in the world when there are doctors especially this kind of (uh) jobs doctors so if no they don't have to work then we might not have doctors we might not have scientists but also I would say that there are people who are willing to do it
for free if let's say they don't have to work and they can get everything but also the word work is subjective because what do you mean by work if you talking about work is just for money then sure yeah (uh) that should be my answer but if
work in terms of because <malay>orang dulu dulu mana ada kerja orang dulu dulu</malay>
they found their own food they eat their own food
you know that kind of thing so if that's considered work
and you don't have to do that
honestly your life is there's nothing to do in your life
yeah it's it's meaningless like it's objectiveless it's
basically you're just surviving and die
ya so <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] so <malay>macam buang masa</malay> [ah] <malay>hidup</malay>
<malay>betul tak</malay>
that's what I feel [lah] because that's why I say this question is quite
I'm on on the fence [ah] on it
ya you can go both ways you know
what would I miss
well I'm already risking everything for my dreams
even right now
exactly I'm risking my financial future
doing the job that I'm doing right now
there's no financial stability so I'm already risking so much
ya so
for my passion for my passion I drop everything I I have dropped everything
yeah
what about you
you only twenty four
you only twenty four
(mmhmm)
yeah I get it
yeah
I I get where you're coming from
but there was an article that I read about
this guy who was forty five years old
he was searching for things that he wants to do so he was trying so many different industries if his he has like failed <malay>banyak banyak</malay> industry he <malay>dah masuk</malay> he fail <malay>banyak</malay>
but then
at forty two [eh] forty two or forty three like
two years before his interview
he had an apprenticeship in this tattoo tattoo artist
and then after the <malay>dia</malay> [dah] <malay>buat</malay> the apprenticeship <malay>dengan</malay> tattoo artist <malay>dia buka kedai dia sendiri</malay>
at forty five and <malay>kedai dia</malay> successful
so
I understand where you're coming from your worries and everything but (uh)
there are people who found themselves at a later age
which is an interesting thing to look at [ah]
(mmhmm)
luck is another thing fortune is another thing
(mmhmm) but the moral is don't give up [ah]
that's I think the biggest moral to take away from all these things
I mean
what do you mean by that
well I think that after you try all these things these skills remain within you
so when you continue searching for that thing
and you continue living
probably you'd find something because at the end of the day to make something means mean meaningful to yourself
the only person to be able to do that is yourself so
until the day that
you <malay>rasa</malay> you
<malay>dah puas</malay> with the thing you <malay>buat</malay> [kan]
then you will find that inner peace with yourself
if not <malay>sampai bila bila pun kan</malay> you <malay>tak akan</malay>
<malay>dapat</malay> that this is the life that I want
because you are
yeah yeah yeah exactly
yeah
and when you explore like I said [ah] everything you explore
on after the next day
all that thing <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>dah</malay> explore remain inside your body
remain inside your mind you have that knowledge
which is
the thing that we should look at [lah]
(mmhmm)
I would wish for like three three thousand more wishes
okay okay
you wanna go first you wanna go first
!wow! okay
okay
that's the first wish [eh]
my first wish will be world peace
world peace
no because like when I say world peace is not just the end of wars and everything is the end of
the sense of
hatred and the sense of
power control
that a person wants inside you know inside them
like that sense of they want power
if we can eradicate that sense
in everyone
honestly there would be you know world peace so when I say world peace that's what I meant
yeah not just stop wars or stop the this [one] it is it's not it's more than just stopping all these things but it's
more like
understanding
that
sense of
having
power
should not be there
(um)
of course
yeah yeah
yeah
ya because when I learn a lot of this traditional stuff <malay>kan</malay> you know I did all traditional stuff
and when I learn
about all this traditional stuff every time a role of a women would be seen as
the least powerful people
and
it's so hard that
in in in this age you want to go against
them
against this ideology
but that ideology is stuck within the culture
and <malay>susah untuk kita nak</malay>
<malay>ubah pikiran orang</malay>
yes
yes
yes
(mmhmm)
yup
I think
what we try to focus what you trying to focus right is
how the social view things
social pressure
I think social pressures is an important thing
yeah
yes
that society <malay>punya ape tu</malay> what do you call it requirement
the society's
yeah
(mmhmm)
yeah and women
ya and like women must be must be kind demure polite and men
yeah
it's so annoying
and
and men have
and men have to be
a certain tough toughness no no mental
yeah
it is like
removing the human in you
ya which is stupid so society is the problem
yeah
[oh] yeah my second wish my second wish
is to feel
satisfaction and happiness in all the decisions I take
because sometimes when you do something
you might look back and like [oh] my god I shouldn't have done this I should have done this instead I should have
I don't want that feeling
yes
yeah
even
even if it so if so if it's the wrong choices
you want to be satisfied with it
you would want to be you would want to take pride in it
yeah
so it's like
(mmhmm)
I mean
that's good for you [lah] because I hardly have that
you went through that life path
yeah
ya with me
yeah
ya so to me [ah] I just want that
satisfaction the feel of satisfaction the feel of happiness
<malay>apa</malay>
yeah you go first [ah] I <malay>tak tahu apa nak</malay>
we're like serious people man
skills of every cook [oh]
why didn't you take culinary [eh]
I think you will like breeze through that course easily
[oh] okay
because <malay>melayu</malay> always <malay>masak with agak agak</malay>
so it's nice when it's <malay>agak agak</malay>
ya ya ya
and
and when it doesn't hit it becomes a troubleshooting
journey
yeah yeah
(hmm)
yeah
precisely what I what I I said [lah] it's like this is the journey of troubleshooting
and then it's nice
but okay anyways ya you want to have skills of all the
cooks in the world
I want the <malay>rendang</malay> italian
italian
<malay>rendang</malay>
<malay>rendang</malay>
my last
my last wish
my last wish
it's to me it's not serious but it's fun for me
I wish for the arts industry to
in this country
no it's a fun thing like because
no no like because that's what I really want it'll be fun to be able to like see
our
yeah our our creatives our singaporean grown talent to to display their creativity out there and be appreciated and paid well
and make it as a career with all the talent they have
yeah I want that that'll be great
ya but they don't pay as good I don't want to get into details but
yeah you know I know
yup
yeah yeah
ya so
just just just
you know
okay [ah] what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
yeah
<malay>mana-mana</malay> [ah]

or one hundred otter-sized horses
I

because scarlet witch is too strong for him
but this doctor strange I can go into places I can look at places I can look in the future I can look in the past I can go back and do this
there's so many things I can do
ya but I know what to do
if you I know when you gonna die

that
that aura that I bring when I'm serious it's very intimidating and
feels
for people is not approachable

what if
[eh] what [ah]
ya means can give full bottle already [lah]
I don't know because because only until six months you can give milk then after six months you can give food already
ya
ya but the thing is that then like this [one] is I don't know
ya how [eh] when to increase milk
too much I don't know
you see when should I increase my baby ounce ounce is ounce I don't know
ya most babies are satisfied with ninety to hundred twenty per feeding during the first month and increase that amount by thirty per month
until ya until they reach a maximum of about two ten to two forty ya then they say if your baby consistently seems to want more or less than this discuss this with your pediatrician pediatrician pediatrician
ya then they say
when should I give my baby more milk however most babies will drink more and grow longer between feedings as they can [eh] as they get bigger and the tummy can hold more milk most newborns
they say at about two months of age babies usually take four to five ounces per feeding every three to four hours four to five is about one twenty [ah]
one twenty to one fifty ounce four to five ounces per feeding so when she two months then
so ya [lah] <malay>dia nak masuk</malay> two months already
ya so hundred or hundred hundred twenty can [ah]
ya
[oh] ya I <malay>lupa</malay> I need to call seoul garden <malay>bukan</malay> need to call I want to call seoul garden ya I <malay>lupa abeh dia punya</malay> time <malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah]

ya so
that <malay>biskut ada banyak kenangan [lah]</malay> with my <malay>datuk</malay> so I used the <malay>biskut</malay> as the background of the painting then (uh) for the forefront of the painting like I put (uh) my sofa all like from the living room

apples was also like something that reminded me of my grandfather because he he always knows that (uh) I like I like to eat apples so he or he would always like buy buy for me then leave it in the fridge then ask me to eat
so ya I made the pillows like (uh) apple like texture so ya it was kinda cool it's cool and for like the second
the second time I took (uh) O level art (um) it was

like (uh) previously there were like some people who say like I I wouldn't look nice with pink hair ya will look like
I don't know gross or something but then I'm like
no I'm gonna do it I'm gonna prove you wrong so I did it so I dyed my hair pink so like that became like my whole theme for my second artwork
so it was like
flowing hair
(uh) for like most of it was like a long canvas then then in the middle was like a self portrait and there was like ya a few other portraits around it
and I incorporated my sister in the artwork

what kind of work I want to be in too I think for now like my plan is like (err)
hopefully my grades is like good enough to go university [lah]
then (uh) let's see if I don't go to university
I think I might go for
earn and learn programme
ya like
like you study
but you also work at the same time
it's like
ya like
like you study for a few months then you go like attachment
so it's like a specialised diploma which I which I think is quite cool [lah]
like it's
some it's like a choice
that I can try
if if legit like I can't go to university or can't go to like earn and learn then I might just go to work [orh]
then if I go work I will I will like
work for two years then hopefully I can like try to
convince my future managers to send me to further studies
ya that's the plan
(mm)
<malay>tapi sekarang susah</malay> [lah] because (uh) COVID ya then <malay>banyak orang</malay>
that <malay>masuk</malay> that programme <malay>jadi</malay> to have something to fall back on
because the pay for it is
still
legit [lah] compared to like having <malay>tak ada kerja langsung</malay> [kan]
true true
ya
it's quite sad
and I heard like there there will be like a second wave [kan]
ya
like

<malay>macam rendam kat dalam air ke apa</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay>
(um) <malay>dia punya buah dia</malay> like

<malay>tapi bunganya dia macam buah gitu</malay> [eh]

<malay>tapi</malay> cute [seh]
[oh] <malay>sedihnya</malay>
<malay>satu minggu</malay> [jer]
really

(mm)
(mm)
[oh] [ah]
I need that
I need that in my life but it's it's probably a lot of like
maintenance like you probably need to really take care of the plants and you really have to take care of the fish
I think you'll get dirty quite fast though
true
I think the the poop is gonna be more
than what the plant take in
damn that's
change the world
(ugh) (uh) is this a question
[oh] okay okay [ah] change the world I don't know [oh] my god I want to be more environment friendly [oh] my god talking about environment friendly
so I join like (uh)
like I join [ah] then I went to this
this (uh)
what's it called
I don't know what is it call it's like a outing I don't know it's like [oh] it it's a volunteer it's a volunteering
like (uh)
stands for bring your own bag like (uh)
they held this thing like (uh) we had to go to like various supermarkets then after that (err) we took the like bags that were donated from the public
then (um) we will take out those (uh) which are dirty then we will we will take the clean ones then (uh) we will go to the various supermarkets then we will offer
people who didn't bring their own bags so we will offer like the tote bags that were donated to for them to use as
like the grocery bags [ah] so it was quite so it's a
(uh) then
I think that is like actually a small thing that can like change the world like in a way like we should really like
cut down on our like plastic consumption [lah]
I think like plastic is really bad for us
like is so ingrained in our society that it's like super hard for like the society to change
but I like the fact that we are like trying slowly now like we can we can also see like <malay>macam</malay>
singapore <malay>cuba</malay> try
to
<malay>jadi macam</malay> more environment friendly
like
I don't know <malay>dia orang buat</malay> like <malay>macam ada</malay> certain
like they implement like certain things [ah] to make it better
like I think the like #pulau semakau# like the like the island they put the trash all like
is getting filled out like quite fast [ah] then they go through
ya we will be fourty
ya but I feel like that tension is right not really pushing people like I feel like singaporeans are just like
just rich like <malay>dia orang rasa</malay> like that <malay>sepuluh sen pon macam tak ada apa apa gitu</malay> so <malay>dia orang macam</malay> [oh] just <malay>bayar</malay> it <malay>gitu</malay>
so like they will still <malay>bayar</malay> it like that ten cent like I think we should like push it up to like fifty cents or something I know fifty cents [kan] confirm <malay>orang macam lagi terasa macam</malay> like [oh] my god that is like <malay>duit</malay> like I should really <malay>bawa</malay> my own plastic bag or like bag in general

cause they want show cancel or not [ah] then they cancel then they refund a bit slow but I got both the refund if I have bought the flight ticket right

can [lah] can relate my money gone so fast man no job now right cause now [ah] COVID then they do online concert
online concert take so much money also but then after that #sian# [lah] my money all gone [lor]

I think right
I think I'll be homesick [lor] cause [ah] I a bit of a mother's girl so a bit of mummy's girl so like my mother not with me [ah] I think I will like I don't feel comfortable [lor] then I will also definitely enjoy the experience [ah] going overseas and then study you know
you [leh] you ever thought about studying overseas
I think australia will be the most safest for me and like but then the thing is realistically speaking you also don't know if the cert can be taken in singapore but theoretically I want to study in korea why cause can see my #oppa#
(um) that's why [ah] if like you want to study overseas as a <malay>melayu</malay> I think [kan] australia will be the most safest because
you know australia they very open and stuff so like ya but then when you overseas you need to stay in a place where [ah] the place has accommodates to what you are [lah] like being a muslim so <malay>kalau kau nak tinggal kat</malay> korea <malay>kau kena tinggal kat</malay> #itaewon# <malay>situ</malay> [ah] [ah] cause I heard situ <malay>banyak kebanyakan melayu tapi</malay> contradict <malay>juga situ juga banyak tempat</malay> clubbing

I saw their McDonald's cone is seventy cent
actually (uh) I never really properly by iris only follow my friend maybe I should try one day then you [leh]
I think standard [ah] I think all poly also got subway and cheers also if I'm not wrong you school got cheers
I also know your school quite big then how [ah] if you late to school or like you #swee# #swee# you just [ah] you know five minute before school you reach then how [ah] you confirm late or not
actually not really [ah] honestly if I late to school then my my my my class at the end of the school [ah] only take me about five five minute to reach there so I can like speed walk then I can just reach earlier but it's quite quite space [ah] got a lot of big spaces [lor] but better [ah] than it being cramp I guess so like not too bad [ah] but still small [ah] but like spcious also to say the least if I'm not wrong also my school the smallest poly right
no [ah] #nanyang# #nanyang# bigger then then then then my school
honestly right (um) my first few days of school [ah] my first few weeks I cannot make it but then but then like afterwards like okay already [lor] (uh) but then like (uh) how to say [ah] your my school (um) some food court they two different lifts must take right specifically that [one] I a bit confusing [ah] and then the one behind my school is just the sports centre so that [one] only if you got like if you got like like that [ah] like then you go there [lor]
!wah! but then the downside of it right I must always wear my jacket cause it's so damn cold [leh] like I swear I don't wear jacket right I I I confirm I want like shiver till damn bad I tell you but then after lunch [ah] somehow [ah] the aircon a bit [leh] <malay>sekali</malay> become hot but maybe because of window open [ah] then that's why the sunlight a bit strong at that period of time
(hmm)
sometimes ya [ah] cause like we want the space to study right after school [ah] cause we need the school wi-fi then [lor] all those kids there already book table then they make noise then they stay there until quite late [ah] then they play their game I don't know league of legend or mobile legend [lor] then they take up the space in (um) in the library [eh] then we cannot sit there to study cause they take the space already [what] they we cannot tell them (uh) excuse me we need the table [mah] so just have to <malay>tahan</malay> [lor] like !wah! [leh] then like the tables we need right then we no choice we just sit on the floor [ah] sit on the floor also a bit cause no charging port no charging port then laptop die [ah] [ah] this kids [ah]
(um) honestly cause of COVID right people will kick you out even if we are students right they don't allow us to like stay there so they like they say got one time the I saw the security uncle tell the person you you over here what you want do you got school or not then the person then the student the student was like no I want study then you should study at home [ah] the uncle was damn rude [eh] then cause the person was taking quite some time to pack right then he was like what you waiting for christmas is it !wah! like this security uncle cannot say nicely [meh] COVID already then like be understanding [ah] we understand you got superiority but like
(hmm) cannot [ah] I think they will be stopped at the entrance I think like cause they wear uniform already [mah] then I don't think so they can go in so like I don't know I don't even think so they can cause nowadays when I go back to school some times I don't see them like coming over also then like I think it's (um) a a rule for them to go back home afterwards I don't know but either way also the place is crowded [lor] cause got student want to use the wi-fi for [mah] ya
ya but like our table not so far apart (um) like they put us five people per table but like how to say [ah] (um) they so one metre one metre also the table but then now five people per table without the one metre ruling [mah] that [one] a bit [ah] cause my teacher sometime don't know if it's true or not so they ya but then also cause of the five people per table one metre away right my teacher also a bit more careful I guess but like [ah] don't know [ah] it's just a bit [lor]
(um) sometimes it cannot be helped [ah] because like is [mah] then everybody need to use it need to take it for for to travel to paxes cannot expect them take Gojek and all the transport [mah] so like (um) sometimes cannot take it [ah] cannot be helped so like public transport cannot be helped [ah]
a bit scared [ah] but like I said cannot help it like I a bit scared cause I live with my grandmother so it's (uh) the thing is more contagious to them you know more higher risk for them so sometimes I a bit scared [leh] but most of the time so you just go home you straight away bathe [lor] don't interact with other people I think that's the best ting to do [lor]
see uni cannot go out she every time got chance she go out you know how old people are you know how they are they cannot sit still [one] the always want go out like that then like most of time we tell her cannot [ah] cause a bit far the places she want to go like her sister's house at #bedok# [eh] a bit far then her sister also want bring her go mall and stuff but then my grandmother also a bit [ah] cause she you know got the safe entry all right then she like she like a bit lazy she don't know how to do the safe entry [mah] she find it very
ya [lah] typical she doesn't like to take unless like she late [lor] then she take Gojek [lor] or she take grab

nowadays got not much work from home [ah] but then rest of my family members all work like my sister now she in camp [ah] then the rest all is (um) cannot work from home [ah] so my mother my parents they go to work physically to you know earn the bucks

it just a conversation between
the module I mean the intern manager like yeah and the company's like it just saying that [oh] near this <malay> ada students that will be working under you like that its just like it just a list [lah] that show that show who will be interning with me basically yeah

my last intern also I was alone so like I'm like extra sad right now cause like I don't have anyone to eat lunch with yeah

yeah

[oh]
(hmm)

(hmm)
yeah I agree I agree that's good that's good you are lucky
(hmm)
!wah!
I know right
then you gonna do part time right also
<malay> kau [dah] <malay> carik (err) part time <malay> punya kerja
what's your opinion of COVID like do you enjoy like the part like quarantine
no actually <malay> aku enjoy [seh]
because like (err) <malay> kau tau aku [lah] <malay> aku memang suka duduk rumah aku memang pemalas nak keluar yeah and I feel like I can really rest cause you know sometimes when you go out you can be tiring like yeah like everyday we have to school right like even though its quite near but just lazy and but then one thing I don't like is the we have to study at home [lah] because its very hard to focus like I'm not gonna lie I slept during lessons before yeah
like thirty minutes like that yeah but its still manage to catch up on the lessons though [lah] I can still understand so okay [lah] but its very hard to focus then very hard to understand also at the same time then like <malay> aku [kan] <malay> pemalu [kan] so [dah] [lah] <malay> nak kena press the recording then like its very hard because you don't want to interfere like when the teachers talking and all right yeah its a bit hard [ah] through teams all
even the teachers was having trouble for some like they don't know how to use teams yeah funny [sia]
yeah
yeah I feel like I I thought more in class like real class yes yes yes
so like it was a very tough year four especially we are in our third year and we have to deal with this so I think like I'm quite proud [lah]
year for us especially we are in our third year and we have to deal with this so I think like I'm quite proud of us yeah
[ha] is it
yeah
<malay> itu [ah]
[a'ah]
!hais!
quite manageable <malay> tapi macam one or two modules <malay> susah sebab ada maths yeah <malay> susah sikit [lah] (hmm)
but <malay>alhamdulillah ada my friend is smart so she can help me
yeah
yeah
then <malay> kadang kadang macam
<malay> macam (err) <malay> kau tak nak macam tanya soalan bodoh gitu so like
yeah
(hmm) honestly I want to <malay> kerja tapi (err) my parents <malay> nak me to go to uni first
which I mean I I don't mind <malay> tapi nak kena tengok result <malay> dulu [lah] cause you know uni [kan] <malay> susah sikit [kan] like you have to be at least three point five and <malay> walaupon macam three point five <malay> pon
you might not get in also because the competition is too thight you know you have to compete with faci people and all so <malay> macam aku pon takut [lah] but at the same time also <malay> aku tak tahu nak buat course <malay> apa yeah I I have to do a lot of research on my own [lah] but yeah everything now is like I'm unsure I just
I'll think about it as you know the days goes by and when we graduate I think I will probably have made my decision by them yeah
(hmm)
all gone already right
[a'ah]
(hmm)
<malay> pandai pandai that's a smart idea yeah
[oh] yes like you know like I I was thinking about it I feel like I don't want to <malay> kerja kat office I think that is so <malay> macam stressfull because you have to deal with <malay> orang lain some <malay> orang tak [kan] <malay> macam suka kau you know and then you have to deal with the boss I mean like you may or may not get a good boss you know you never know then yeah I mean like the working hours
I mean like it's it's tiring [lah] from what I see like I ask my sister right like how she work like she also have her own office drama <malay> padahal dia tak buat apa apa macam ada orang macam just don't like her [lah] like especially since she got award she got an award right for being the best a good worker like this [ah] the person was like jealous of her and all so its like so annoying I don't know I think I want <malay> aku nak jadi boss
I think that will be nice but business <malay> tak tau [ah] <malay> nak buka business <malay> apa [eh]
yeah I don't know what what what is like trending now what's what do you think a good business actually now
[oh] yeah <malay> aku nak jual apa [seh]
but it's their used items right
[oh] I see
[oh] [oh] yeah yeah yeah
true
I think like my thought to choice will be either open a cafe or maybe sell something like I don't know some jugs any clothes you know
yeah but I feel like cafe will be like very nice you know yeah
[oh] my god we should open the cafe together
yes yes
<malay> tapi like what kind of cafe you know this kind of you want like like like some cafe they sell like lunch kind or lunch dinner [ah] like rice everything right but there is also the bakery [kan] of cafe with the coffee cake which one you want
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
full business like
like
yeah yeah and all
so like I think that's a good idea because like you never know whether your business will flourish and be successful so
yeah you know <malay> macam orang dulu dulu cakap start [jer] <malay> kecik apa <malay> sikit sikit nanti (err)
[a'ah]
yeah
yet
true
one
one thing for your
is that we should open
at the west because all the cafes right now is is at the <malay> dekat #bugis# <malay> semua jauh kita [kan] <malay> tinggal kat west [kan] <malay> habis cam cafe <malay> dekat sini is so limited so we should open one at our area yeah
I think the west people will appreciate it
ya that's why we should like [oh] my god you know what you should do we should
also sell bubble tea at same time that's what will make us have money gain money yes
<malay> sekarang (err) <malay> makanan apa [ah] <malay> yang viral <malay> sekarang
what is the trending food right now <malay> apa apa [lah] <malay> apa apa
[oh]
same same
[oh] yeah <malay>dekat</malay> Liho <malay>pon ada</malay>
yeah but I've never tried [lah]
yeah
are you serious
you should do you are free right now
yes and it was successful it was so nice like the milk and everything it's very creamy it's like your coffee but it's like so creamy it's like at least you put whipped cream inside I mean technically is dalgona is actually whipped coffee [kan] yeah it's very nice [ah] you should try later you should do it later
<malay> kau ada kau ada
<malay>kau ada</malay> instant coffee
[ha] okay then <malay> kita boleh buat [ah] <malay> nanti
(hmm)
(err) I think brown sugar right like everything also have brown sugar then I see <malay> macam orang put the pearl <malay> dekat pancake or something <malay> macam semua benda nak kena ada pearl <malay> macam a bit <malay> merepek [lah]
yeah I mean <malay> aku suka bubble tea but as just a drink is okay [lah] but once its like in completing in food I think it's weird but I don't know I've never tried but just the idea of it <malay> macam merepek [ah] yeah
[oh]
(hmm)
is it nice
is it nice
[hor] [hor] [hor]
yeah
true we should go one day

it's gonna be a struggle for me but I do like <malay> macam #tempura# you know <malay> dengan nasi nasi those breaded kind of food is nice !duh! like I would defenitely want to try it like that because <malay> macam authentic [kan] <malay> macam sedap [ah] <malay> dengan dia punya japanese curry I've never try it

[oh] yes true like maybe they never clean their hands its a bit yeah I mean for at least the singapore singapore like the food standard the quality like when they were prepare the food I feel like we can trust them because it is very strict right they have to undergo like
you know all this
purpose so what's the good food there
yeah the certificate so I feel like yeah
everything is nice actually is like singapore [ah] but you know their food <malay> macam it's feels more homie feels more authentic like their <malay> nasi goreng can imagine [lah] <malay> macam very nice <malay> dengan dia punya sambal dengan dia punya keropok is yeah you should try go there one day

<malay>atau lebih</malay> [lah] <malay>kita tergantung</malay> (uh) it depends so <malay>untuk topic hari ini kita akan berbual pasal</malay>
mango <malay>buah mangga</malay> any thoughts okay so <malay>bila dengar bila</malay> first <malay>dengar</malay> [jer] (uh) this word what comes to your mind <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango [jer] when you hear mango what comes to your mind the first thing <malay>apa</malay> [jer]
okay anything else
okay
okay that's great [ah] okay
I happen to like mango <malay>juga</malay> so (uh) <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango [jer] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> !woo! <malay>sedap</malay> [ah] like
<malay>nak</malay>
<malay>rasa macam</malay> !wah!
<malay>macam nak makan</malay> [jer] mango [eh] <malay>macam sekarang ini pun berbual pasal</malay> mango [jer] <malay>macam nak makan sahaja</malay> so (uh) first [jer] <malay>kita</malay> (uh) <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango
actually <malay>bila</malay> first <malay>dengar</malay> [jer] <malay>macam rasa</malay>
the first thing that comes to my mind is actually the brand mango
I don't know if you've (uh) I don't I don't know if any of you <malay>dah pernah dengar ke tak</malay> but
the brand mango <malay>ni memang makcik</malay> I <malay>memang suka pakai <malay>baju</malay> mango this T shirt from this brand <malay>nama dia</malay> mango (err) by the way <malay>ini</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> sponsored [lah] [eh] so <malay>kita ya faham-faham</malay> [jer]
okay so what comes to mind <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango kita <malay>dah berbual</malay> okay so now we are proceeding to the shape of the mango so describe the shape of the mango let's go
okay
okay <malay>jadi</malay> (err) <malay>buah</malay> mango <malay>ini kalau kita berbual</malay> if we talk about the shape we are
it's it's not a definite shape I can say [ah] it's not a definite shape it's not a it's not a a shape that is
is precise or [ah] specific is
it could either be a it it could be it could either be an oval or it could either be I don't know
(um) it's slightly bended it's <malay>bengkok sikit ke dalam</malay> <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tengok betul-betul</malay>
it's it's a shape that is very complicated it's like
something <malay>macam apa benda ya</malay> shape <malay>dia</malay> so
mango <malay>ini memang</malay> interesting <malay>memang</malay> it's
unique
<malay>selain daripada bentuk dia ini</malay>
okay but oddly
when we see when okay when we cut the mango into parts
we can somehow cut it well in a way that <malay>kita boleh makan betul tak</malay>
(mm) so <malay>kita boleh potong belah dua</malay> we can cut it into half and then we can cut it in squares so <malay>dia macam kotak-kotak gitu</malay> so we can we can eat it like that <malay>atau kita boleh</malay>
<malay>kupas kulit dia</malay> and then <malay>kita boleh makan</malay>
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay>

among
all of this the types of mango that we see

<malay>entah</malay> [eh] when okay when the colour the colour of the mango [kan] yellow [kan]
it's
<malay>bila</malay> the first thing when you see
yellow
you will associate it with a lot of good things because the colour is very attractive honestly I think the colour is <malay>betul-betul</malay> attractive
and
it just draws
my attention to it so <malay>bila nampak macam</malay> colour colour #bingsu# like she said (uh) she mentioned earlier <malay>bila nampak</malay> colour colour #bingsu# <malay>macam</malay>
!ee! <malay>nak</malay> [ah] <malay>tengok macam</malay> the first thing I see is the the

if we're going to talk about <malay>benda-benda yang kita tak boleh tak boleh makan</malay> there's definitely mango as a brand <malay>itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>itu macam</malay>
it's like a brand
<malay>yang</malay> quite popular and has been around for quite long as well
so
it's
it's interesting that they use a (uh) (err) a fruit name for a brand because
(uh) they
when when you see the logo it looks quite prestigious and all [lah] because you know the way they design the the logo I mean it's just
<malay>cuma</malay> word mango [jer] <malay>kot</malay> I mean nothing interesting about that but
the fact that they could bring it as a brand and could make it something like <malay>macam betul-betul macam</malay> !wah! <malay>nampak</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> !wah!
<malay>macam</malay>
I guess
that's interesting
okay
(uh) besides that (uh) <malay>kita berbual pasal resepi-resepi</malay> mango <malay>ada apa-apa resepi tak yang kita tahu</malay>
<malay>betul betul</malay> I feel like [ah] okay but honestly I think (err)

mango cake is something that you would find easily
(hmm)
exactly
exactly I feel that
sure I mean (uh) that whatever that she said was right because I feel that
ya you can do anything you want <malay>dengan</malay> mango cause I feel that
<malay>entah</malay> [eh]
we don't really think about
the it's interesting that mango is the topic <malay>untuk hari ini pasal kita</malay> actually <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>kita suka makan</malay> mango <malay>tapi kita tak pernah berbual pasal</malay> mango we rarely talk about mango so now that we are talking about it now now we're really really thinking
[oh] my god there's so many things that we eat that consists of mango actually if you think about it besides mango puffs [ah] we there's also
mango pudding we always have mango pudding <malay>dekat mana mana pun mesti nak cari</malay> mango pudding especially <malay>dekat</malay> wedding
they sometimes have that and mango pudding
<malay>atau dekat rumah kawan</malay>
like at your friend's house <malay>mesti ada</malay> (err)
pudding [kan]
like
it's amazing how how much I love mango pudding
process
that's true
because <malay>kita tak pernah</malay> I mean <malay>jarang</malay> [lah] <malay>ya berbual pasal</malay> mango that's what I find it interesting <malay>kalau kita berbual untuk</malay> our first recording <malay>kita berbual pasal</malay> mango <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> I feel like none of us actually think have you ever think
about having mango soda
<malay>tak pernah ada</malay> [kan]
do you have have you had any mango sodas
I really wish <malay>ada</malay> mango soda
(um) that's that's right that's actually quite smart maybe you should try that next time <malay>kot</malay>
okay
(uh) do you know that (uh) in some parts of the world <malay>dekat luar negeri</malay> some parts of the world <malay>dekat tempat lain</malay>
mango is actually called
the king of fruits
that's shocking [kan] (um)
the fact that <malay>dekat</malay> southeast asia <malay>dekat asia tenggara kita</malay> actually the king of fruits <malay>ini</malay>
actually durian I don't know if you guys know durian but that's actually the king of fruits in this region
so ya okay now okay time check we still have about (um)
about forty minutes
left in having our conversation so now I'm going to go all out with facts with nutritional facts about
<malay>buah mangga</malay>
okay
so besides that (uh) okay the the scientific name [eh] <malay>untuk ini ini buah</malay> is actually mangifera indica
have you heard of it
and none of us have heard of it we don't even care
okay it's a drupe or stone fruit <malay>itu macam semacam buah itu</malay> the type <malay>dia nama dia</malay> stone fruit
[kan] (uh) <malay>ada</malay> berry <malay>ada apa apa semua</malay> then this one is just stone fruit which is cool because <malay>memang</malay> if you look at it
it actually looks like a stone I don't I have no idea but
once again mango is awesome
okay so it means [ah] okay what stone fruit means is actually the the seed is large so <malay>dia punya biji</malay> (err) <malay>biji buah dia itu memang besar</malay>
<malay>buah mangga betul tak</malay>
and
I think it's awesome that we can actually eat it off the
the fruit the seed
okay and mango <malay>itu</malay> actually <malay>juga</malay> native <malay>dekat</malay> india
<malay>dekat</malay> india <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>senang nak cari dekat situ</malay>
(uh) southeast asia <malay>asia tenggara</malay> that's why that's why we said that it's really really easy to find mangoes here because
ya I don't know it's just it's just where it's probably easier to grow here and cultivate
and okay
mango has been cultivated for over four thousand years
how interesting is that <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>lama gila</malay> [seh] like what the hell
it's way before all of us

<malay>betul</malay> I don't know

<malay>cara</malay> you explain <malay>macam</malay> a bit weird <malay>tapi tak apa</malay> [lah] [eh] I I think we get it so whoever that's going to vet this audio please I apologize <malay>kalau</malay> topic <malay>dia macam</malay> lame <malay>sangat</malay> but we'll try to get better topics in the future definitely
so because this is our first (uh) topic [kan] so
ya no high expectations I'm so sorry
but yes we're trying
okay
now that we (uh) we hit thirty two minutes let's (err) just
take a break from mango topic because (uh) whoever that is going to listen this for one hour <malay>mesti boring gila dengar kita berbual pasal</malay> mango <malay>betul tak</malay> so let's hear about your day what have you done today
thank you for asking I know
question <malay>dia tadi satu</malay> question [eh] <malay>tapi dah melalut</malay> [eh] <malay>tak apa</malay> it's okay
so for my day I today I
okay this week actually is my first week (err) since (err) holiday that school resumes so (err) as per usual I had my class today <malay>tapi</malay> because you know [kan] <malay>sekarang tengah</malay> pandemic <malay>tengah</malay>
<malay>tengah</malay> you know like the the virus is you know <malay>masih dekat</malay> singapore <malay>masih ada</malay> cases [lah] [kan] so today we had
for a month actually we have to be (uh) doing classes online
it's really it it's it's really sad because I see I <malay>pun dah melalut tak apa</malay> it's okay
I mean
we're just talking we're just having a conversation just chilling
okay back to the topic (err) seriously I think quite sad because <malay>dah berapa bulan</malay> [seh] <malay>dekat rumah</malay> like
I was hoping that we could go back to school because I really am productive <malay>dekat dekat sekolah</malay> like my brain my work like [ah] I can just think and do work
like
much more than I can do work at home <malay>macam macam mana</malay> [eh] <malay>macam susah</malay> [lah] <malay>buat kerja dekat rumah</malay> cause you know you have your bed you have your
your I don't know food there's a lot of food so you get distracted easily <malay>dekat rumah</malay> so your productivity level is not as
much as when you're outside
in school especially
I'm sure some of you would feel the same
maybe not maybe some of you all feel that <malay>dekat rumah lagi</malay> (err) productive [lah] but today is (uh)
quite decent for me
nothing too extreme nothing to some <malay>macam</malay> okay okay [jer] [lah] I still managed to get some of my personal time today so that's nice
okay what do you think are you the type of person who would do work or who is more productive <malay>dekat rumah ke</malay> or is more productive <malay>dekat luar</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> exactly
okay so
now that we've (uh) talked about our day
let's talk about okay before we going (err) we're going back to talking about the fruit [lah] [eh] cause
I don't know let's just talk about this it's more casual [lah] [kan] so okay (err) what [eh] what food did you have today
(mm) (mm)
I had <malay>sambal</malay> fish and <malay>sambal</malay> egg
then (err) <malay>ada</malay> this <malay>apa nama dia macam</malay> soup <malay>petola gitu</malay>
dengan <malay>bihun bihun</malay> [eh] <malay>ke suun</malay>
so
I think it's <malay>suun</malay> this <malay>dia macam bihun</malay> but it's like (um)
I don't know it's similar to glass noodles <malay>yang dari</malay> japan so I think that's what it is then <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] (um) ya that's what I had today and I had a sip of tea
today (um) because you know (uh) work's getting really really stressful <malay>jadi macam</malay> you know we just had have a sip of cammomile tea then (err) <malay>lepak lepak [dah] itu</malay> [jer]
then okay let's (uh) start talking about next thing shall we talk about fruits still or shall we move on to another topic
okay if it's up to me I would like to talk about <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>apa yang</malay> best [eh] <malay>nak berbual</malay> okay let's talk about our favorite music
okay what (uh) which artist do you listen to the most
(um) <malay>kalau kita berbual pasal</malay>
artist okay <malay>kita berbual pasal</malay> genre first okay we'll talk about genre my favourite genre is very (err) much the same as hers (um) it's very wide I don't have a specific genre
okay but
(um) I wouldn't say okay my favourite song
is in a genre that is not my favourite genre do you get what I mean <malay>macam</malay>
my favourite song is this symphonic song called canon in D I think you all know this song [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay that song is my favourite song
it
just gives me it just brings out a lot of my emotions that I rarely have <malay>jadi macam bila dengar</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] my god my emotions <malay>semua keluar</malay> but like
that's just what you feel about it
(err) I rarely talk about emotions so
it's weird that I'm talking about it now
okay so (uh) besides that (err) canon in D [eh] that's one genre that I don't listen all the time but that that's a song that I really really like above all the other songs that I hear
and okay
let's talk about the next genre my next genre <malay>yang</malay> favourite <malay>itu</malay> let's see I think for now I don't have it's a tie between (err) western songs <malay>dengan</malay>
k-pop
they both have very distinct (uh) features they both have
however <malay>macam</malay> similar <malay>dia itu macam sama tapi lain</malay> [lah] you you you get what I mean
<malay>dia punya</malay> upbeat <malay>dia punya</malay> instrumental <malay>semua sama tapi</malay> it's just that the language probably different <malay>kot macam</malay> that's the distinct difference
okay and then (um) my favorite song from western and let's see I think it's <malay>paling banyak lagu-lagu</malay> western <malay>dekat</malay> <malay>kot</malay> that is the one that's very popular
I I would say <malay>lagu</malay> (um)

it's called #mevoy# M E V O Y <malay>daripada</malay> [eh] the one that is that sang the song is julieta venegas
that song is very nice <malay>dia</malay>
the the background music has this (um) hum
accordion and I don't know it's just it's just very
it's very cute like when you listen to the song you would think of being in the
feel and what not
okay because we're (err) recording at a very late time because my sister just got back from work so please

I categorize my favourite food <malay>dalam dua</malay>
categories <malay>tahu macam satu</malay> I like (err)
<malay>satu</malay> is comfort food <malay>dengan lagi satu</malay> is food
that
I okay comfort food <malay>ini</malay> [kan] is the the the category for comfort food <malay>ini</malay> [kan] is the type of food that I can eat
everyday <malay>tak jelak-jelak</malay> like
<malay>tak bosan bosan</malay> every time every time I can just I can eat that everyday literally <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay> let's say <malay>kita berbual pasal</malay> (err) the food that really like <malay>macam</malay>

but <malay>dia</malay> as a real person
(uh) without her acting self [eh]
<malay>dia betul-betul</malay> not like that not like how she's like in her show she's just chill she's just calm she's very cheerful okay in the show her voice is very <malay>macam</malay>

<malay>dua minit lagi</malay> okay my favourite [ah] is also
<malay>siapa nama dia</malay> (err) ya (uh) kristen bell I think she's very talented
the fact that she can
because I I feel like the good show [eh] the sorry the good place is a show that is not easy to act in because
it's it involves okay [ah]
in general I think acting is just
a wonderful career okay I I cannot believe in singapore it's a non essential thing
people need their entertainment for all to live
you can't expect people to live at home <malay>habis tak tengok cerita apa apa pun</malay>
boring <malay>gila</malay>
(err) <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] okay (err) since <malay>kita punya</malay> do you have any last words <malay>macam</malay> like you know to wrap it up
yes that's really important this
it's not a hoax it's it's the truth (mm)
a lot of people are dying a lot of people have been dead from the virus so please be responsible and wear your masks people okay
and to wrap up (err) ya so
I think for every episode we'll just try to think of things to talk about
(uh) I'm sorry today like for the first trial video it's not
it's not the it's not the kind of topic that we get to talk about (err) [eh] sorry (um) what am I talking about I'm sorry that the first trial (err) recording is (uh) not
I don't know an idealistic
trial recording I have no idea what an idealistic trial recording is but ya I feel like we could have talked more about ourselves first
but I thought that mango is an easy topic to talk about [kan] <malay>macam senang apa nak berbual pasal</malay> mango <malay>apa yang susah sangat</malay> so but I I thought wrong so throughout the whole time it's a little bit like (um) <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
okay we have five minutes left I'm just going to talk about let's talk about ourselves [lah] okay
so (err) my full name is actually
(err) wahayu agustian but I have an english name it was given to me so
so (err) my my preferred
name that I always use is wesley agustian so people of a lot of people call me #agus#

diploma I I take I I'm taking diploma in arts management so I do a lot of (uh)
I do a lot of paperwork
I do a lot of research I do not much of a research yet but
I'm definitely going to do that soon
then yeah
(uh) I aspire to be actually I am very enthusiastic about languages I know about seven languages at least
no not at least
about seven languages so at least five I guess
and they are english language which is what I'm really fluent in then <malay>apa itu</malay>
I <malay>juga boleh</malay> [eh] I <malay>pun boleh berbual bahasa melayu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> normal cause we're singaporeans [kan] I'm born here
(um) <malay>berbual bahasa melayu</malay> just a normal thing but <malay>kita pun boleh berbual bahasa indonesia</malay> because
my family's is an indonesian family so <malay>kita</malay> my
(uh) next fluent or I would say a native language would be <malay>bahasa indonesia</malay> actually
because (uh) that's that's how I was raised I actually <malay>berbual</malay>
indonesian actually like as my daily thing
but I'm also recently I think like in like I think four years five years back I've being trying to learn [ah] my regional languages which is
(um) my parents' native languages like <malay>dia orang punya bahasa asal dia orang</malay> which is
(err) <malay>bahasa sunda dengan bahasa jawa</malay> so my mom speaks sundanese and my dad speaks javanese so
yeah
<malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh]

so ya
(err) thank you so much we'll see you in the next recording do let us know if it's okay or not thank you so much

okay
okay ya
we're good
alright [eh] <malay> macam [eh] [eh] okay [ah]
okay [ah] <malay> boleh boleh no problem
[ah] [eh] [eh]
[eh] bro school is [eh] I hate school
school can go suck dick I'm telling you
okay (uh) #rabak# <malay> gila okay you imagine [eh] okay <malay> kau kau just imagined
<malay> aku I got I got like one (uh) one website
okay [eh] I got one website for
for this one module okay I've five modules [lah]
so I have my student portal that's one website
okay [ah] then I got one website for my
(uh) module submission for another module
I have one website for this other module submission
okay one other website for this one <malay> punya module <malay> macam Q&A
in total [kan] <malay> kau tahu in total <malay> aku ada berapa banyak website
<malay> aku ada like around nine websites <malay> tahu in total and this is just week four
apa #lanchiau# [ah] <malay> aku tanya engkau apasal [lah]
ya
it's okay so one of the one of the websites [kan] is for
like this community discussion
okay and
like you know you know
amongst the students [lah]
ya so you know how
if you have physical lectures right at least you can ask on your left on your right
okay like [eh] this one how this [one] how
you know then after that this community discussion is basically to replace that [lah] to replace
it's like a forum
ya then after that there's like (um) there's
there's weightages going into it so this
for example this community forum okay
I have like it's like ten percent of my total grades
for example like that then I have to ya then I have to meet like
a quota every week
ya so they force us to interact so I ask around some random stupid questions [ah]
like [oh] this [one] how <malay> padahal this [one] is everyone know <malay> semua orang tahu ini benda
it's just
it's just we're forced to meet that quota [lah]
and you know that you know that because it's online there's so many limitations
and and it is so
it's nothing can beat [lah] having a lecture or having school in person because online is just so ineffective where
<malay> kau tak boleh actually learn everything in one shot
<malay> kau tak boleh ask your on the left on the right
<malay> kau tak boleh
ask even the professor [lah]
in person and the professors
they can explain better in person cause they have a white board
but if you use Zoom
they cannot really explain everything effectively [what]
so <malay> aku just <malay> bingit gila having this online lesson actually <malay> aku tak kisah tahu pasal COVID
<malay> tapi ever since this <malay> aku masuk [eh] !wah! !wow! <malay> aku bilang kau #rabak# <malay> gila
seriously it's so ineffective then I'm
I I like stay up until like two A M almost everyday [sia] just to do work
#rabak# <malay> gila [ah]
#rabak# <malay> gila [ah] ya [sia] #rabak# <malay> gila I tell you
(mmhmm) ya
ya
but
[ah] [sia] seriously as I (err) I didn't know uni is so bad that it's legit just <malay> kau pandai pandai [ah]
<malay> kau imagine like on the first week
not not on the first week [lah] like almost all lectures I have
this one lecture I have this one module for example
where the professor would just talk about
this one concept right
and they would just like touch and go like that
they don't even talk about it in detail
then after that they expect us to know everything
for example [ah] python (err) you there's this [one]
[ah] ya python programming
so there's this one thing where you can use a system argument to
ask the user to input as opposed to
using an input [ah] input format [lah]
so the the professor didn't even talk about it he just talked about it for like two minutes
and then he expect
he expect us to know how to do it for the first assignment
like
he expected us to know how to do it for our first assignment even though he just touched on it for like five minutes
that's that is so terrible
that that is so bad
<malay> aku pun tak tahu [ah] ya ya some
it's it's just so bad [ah] like and then
I don't know like even the other day
(err) I have this other module okay
[ah] it's basically I'm learning about digital electronics [lah]
okay so <malay> aku kena
I I got some friends [lah] I got some friends here and there
and then after that they because <malay> aku from engineering background <malay> apa
right so <malay> dia orang pernah tanya aku [ah] [eh] #koi# can teach me or not this this this okay [ah] <malay> boleh aku ajar engkau [ah]
then the other day I I taught two of them I only took
two hours to teach them I think less than two hours
and they already understood everything whereas the professor took like a few
[ah] like an hour to explain things and no one actually really understood what he was trying to teach
so it was quite bad [lah] because if you compare poly with uni right
poly is
you know you know how you have like one whole week or even like you have one whole day
to learn this one concept right
but uni my uni right my one
my one lecture is like three concepts in two hours
just uni things [eh]
ya and
ya and honestly I didn't expect that it would be that way
because I thought that
when people say Singapore university of self study [eh]
okay like that's what people say [lah] my friend also say that he's in
and then after that I'm like okay [lah] maybe is terrible [lah]
but then when I come to I expected them to at least
guide us through the way but
they don't really they don't really do that
they just <malay> macam [ah] okay [ah] <malay> kau buat gini [ah] okay <malay> kau tahu bagus kau tak tahu [ah] <malay> kau belajar [ah] Google [ah]
<malay> apasal like
I don't know [ah] to me it's it's it's just nonsense [ah]
and the gap the the gap
between uni and poly is just too big it took me like I think
two three weeks to actually properly settle in to the lifestyle
like like doing work doing work until like two
(err) asking asking around people who
for things and they also don't know how to do it essentially
and just
[sia] [lah] poly <malay> mana ada aku stay up <malay> sampai pukul dua pagi [sia] <malay> buat kerja
in uni I have to constantly stay up until two just to finish up my work
not even not even finish up [ah] just to do it
then it's just like it's just so I don't know
this is just too crazy [lah] honestly it's just too crazy
ya ya
was seriously too drastic but one good thing is the people there are are decent [lah]
(err) I mean I mean we're okay because when you hear like I <malay> aku tak tahu kalau kau ada dengar tak
<malay> tapi aku ada dengar that (um)
this type of high
(um) really high highly regard uni right
they the students there are very snake you know they're very competitive they're very snake they not brother [one] [ah]
they really not brother [one] but but right at least it's they quite brother [lah] because
(err) and I found out most of them are around my same age
where like twenty three twenty four twenty two I have never met a person who is actually younger than twenty [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] irfan</P1> your age [lah] but what I'm saying is
wait what's your age what's your age
ya I've never met anyone below twenty [eh]
ya I [eh]
ya ya (uh) everyone there is from like or from poly
wait [eh] hang on [eh]
ya [ah]
<malay> apa dia [ah] <malay> cakap cakap cakap [jer]
[ah] okay
but
[oh] part time uni
(err) (um)
[oh] honestly the
I don't think even is a
I don't know is a good choice or not I got I got two friends in
and they say they're constantly being barraged with work [lah]
there's things to do here and there
ya I think is mainly for people from like from poly the more #rilek# ones [lah] the [one] the not so snake [one]
ya
<malay> aku tak tahu
legit [ah] <malay> aku tak tahu aku tak tahu because I've only heard about all these like up there <malay> punya uni you know
but I but ya
a few accounts what
ya ya ya
<malay> macam gitu [ah]
<malay> tak tahu [ah] <malay> macam mana padahal baru week four
<malay> baik baru baru week <malay> besok is week four <malay> baru week four <malay> aku [dah] ada a test tomorrow
which is ten percent of my grades
<malay> besok (err) six thirty
ya it's an it's an online it's an online test [lah] [eh] no it's a
test from home
but I'm this browser that you know how you got this browser you cannot
access internet you cannot alternate tab all this right
ya ya ya something like that
ya so so my they got this lockdown browser where they
where they shut down [eh] where they block on all the other screens except for your main screen
and they [ah]
they force they shut things down like
your Telegram
like Discord Steam all they force shut down then you cannot access them
ya [lah]
stewing from that [lah]
ya is it is a browser [lah] on the computer
ya the then
ya well ya
ya
I think I no I'm I need to have I need to have internet connection to have the test [lah]
but I cannot access anything else
ya but I need internet connection because it's a test [what]
so they [ah] and then after that the test got webcam [ah]
I need to on the webcam
so so you can use you can use laptop or you can use your own webcam [ah] either one
if you use laptop then after that you just use your normal laptop your laptop for school already got webcam [what]
ya ya ya (um) the one of the professors actually do that
using her phone for a webcam for like writing things down because maths
and maths how can you teach maths without actually writing things down right
ya
<malay> macam gitu [ah] [ah] I don't know [ah]
then (um) you imagine [eh] [kan] okay <malay> kau imagine <malay> kau masuk sekolah
<malay> kau masuk sekolah then at like my at like your second week they're like [oh] by the way
by the way
you have a report ya [ah]
[ah] <malay> aku aku macam !alamak! aku baru saja
<malay> masuk sekolah week two <malay> dia orang [dah] cakap [eh] you got report [ah] to write down I'm like [sia] [lah]
stress [pe] boy <malay> buat report
[ah] then <malay> apa
cause
ya then yesterday I spent like the
I think I spent like two hours writing on just like a few paragraphs of my report because I've never actually I have done a report in poly
but report in poly and report in uni is you know the standards are different
(err) like you actually have to put in some effort
for a report in uni
I mean
I mean in poly you can just <malay> sembarang buat then okay <malay> [dah] some #chapalang# report okay <malay> [dah] submit
but
would uni I actually have to write I had like ten tabs open just
for
(um) just for this report section
ya [lah] I'm but as in what I'm saying is thatthe the step from poly to uni is very drastic you know
I got one friend who is taking this module as me
<malay> lepas tu he panicking already he panicking then he want he want
exempt from this module [lah] <malay> lepas tu dia macam [eh] <malay> ini macam mana ini itu macam mana [eh] <malay> aku tak tahu [ah] [eh] [eh] [eh] [eh] [eh]
then you know he's just panicking [ah]
<malay> dia dari poly but I think <malay> dia dari poly <malay> juga but I think he he doesn't handle stress well [lah]
(mm) <malay> gitu
(mm) trimester
[ah] so but then for the first year
[ah]
okay so it's very weird
when the other day when I was comparing I was talking I was telling I was talking about this with my friends the other day it was super weird
so you know how in or even in you had
thirteen weeks in one semester
right
and then after that my trimester you'd would expect because I have three trimesters in one year right you would expect it to be like okay [lah] maybe
lesser lesser weeks right lesser weeks because because trimester you have three terms as compared to two terms
right
so you would expect like okay [ah] trimester but then [eh] my trimester
thirteen weeks also [eh] then I see [eh] their semester
thirteen weeks [eh] like <malay> apa [sia] this one
what did I sign up for my my I got three terms each term is thirteen weeks
got two terms each term is thirteen weeks also like what
ya my break time is small [lah]
but it doesn't it doesn't defeat the fact that
my one term is the same as other university's one term eventhough I'm trimester based you know
ya

and then after that [one] of the questions I can remember I two of the questions I cannot remember one of the questions was like
(err) out of all the modules
out of the out of all the modules in the module list right
what modules do you like the most and I'm like [oh] shit
<malay> aku tak tahu [sia] module list <malay> apa so <malay> aku Google [lah]
while during the interview while during the thirty seconds break in between questions right
(err) between question and answer <malay> aku Google [lah] <malay> untuk <malay> untuk dengan module list
<malay> aku Google <malay> untuk module list then <malay> aku tengok tengok tengok then okay <malay> aku [dah] boleh answer
<malay> lepas tu aku answer [kan] (mm) <malay> aku I said [ah] (hmm) (uh) looking through the module list right
I realised that there's this this this [lah] and have done
this this this in the past and also (uh) I have some experience with it okay next question
(err) what modules do you like the least then after that I I reply in this exact same way
looking through the module list (err) I realised that there's maths [lah]
I I'm I'm okay with maths I'm I I did well for maths
but I don't like maths [lah] that's how I replied you know in the interview
and I managed to get through the through the video interview and into the group interview [lah]
ya so the group interview it was like stage two right
so the group interview (um) it was (err)
the group interview was like I thought it was like one group by one group
okay then after that they brought us out to this (err) to this like before this room after registering
then after that I'm like [ah] then I was talking with my group my [lah] then I was like [eh]
if it's a group interview how come we're all over here [sia] going inside this one room is it a mass interview
don't know [ah] maybe [ah]
okay <malay> [dah] masuk [dah] sit down <malay> semua then they introduce themselves
then they're like okay so this is the
this this is the like the contents okay this is the problem
I want you all to you you all got thirty minutes I want you all to work on this
and by the end of the thirty minutes you are to present a
maximum hundred eighty second video presentation using your phone
then I'm like <malay> apasal ini okay <malay> buat [ah] <malay> buat buat buat [dah] berbual
<malay> [dah] berbual pasal content <malay> lepas tu [dah] nak record
<malay> [dah] record <malay> habis [kan] <malay> lepas tu kita hantar [ah]
then like okay you got any questions okay Q&A Q&A <malay> berbual berbual tanya tanya benda then I'm like
okay if there's nothing else that's all you just can go home !huh!
<malay> gitu je <malay> aku macam [ah] [oh] serious [ah] <malay> gitu je [ah] <malay> aku tengok kanan kiri [sia]
ya and then like [ah] okay that's all I was like [ah] okay I expected something a bit more difficult [lah]
then after that like ya we'll then you can go then we'll send you the (uh) the email
saying whether you have passed or not [lah] like next week
okay so I I expected seven days from now [lah]
(mm) okay then on the seventh day from the interview I was like [eh] shit I never received any email [sia]
I never receive any email I was like fuck [ah] <malay> habis I didn't get [lah] after all
then on the eighth day in the morning [oh] I received the email congratulations <malay> baik baik baik
ya <malay> gitu [lah]
[ah] [ah] okay because right
is they want to build it such that
you are working in a team
right so
that's why the group interview
is is mass as a group interview but then they want to see how well you work in a team
how your how well you work in a team
how you would communicate with people how you work with people from different backgrounds
with people that you don't know
so is mainly built on top of that
of how you
it's a very team effort [lah]
so I I guess they evaluate as to how we
were acting in a team okay then after that how well we do our things our
video interview [eh] our video presentation how was it
all all that thing [lah]
ya that's that's how I did it [lah] I don't know maybe because

[eh] <malay> jangan gitu #lu# <malay> fikir #lu# <malay> siapa
[eh] ultraboost is for casual this [one] is for running
eventhough I have no time to run unfortunately
no it's not that I have no time seriously you know I I doing work
right you know I the other day I spent three almost four hours right
trying to troubleshoot this one python bug okay I had this code
okay and what it's supposed to do is I take in a bunch of inputs
okay with a commas in between so for example twelve comma
two comma eight for example that's my input then what it would do is that it would
do some stupid calculation [lah] so I had this [ah]
I had this lake concept method the other time
and (err) I will I couldn't get it to work [lah] even though the concept was there
the idea was there but I couldn't get it to work so I asked my friends
then they tried they tried my concept I two of them tried my concept and both of them can get it to work
can get it to work you know but I cannot get it to work even though they have the same idea as me
then I was like <malay> kenapa [sia] <malay> tak boleh [oh] and then after that I spent I spent like
<malay> aku agak aku spend <malay> macam three four hours on it [lah]
three four hours okay I started at eleven <malay> aku habis pukul dua pagi tahu
<malay> aku habis pukul dua pagi then after that you know what was the problem
the problem was because my input no it's okay syntax [lah]
it was supposed to be twelve comma two comma eight right I put twelve comma
space two comma space eight
because because of that space right it costed me three four hours you know
then after <malay> aku just found out that it's because of spacing then <malay> aku bilang kawan aku [eh] okay <malay> kau try <malay> kau letak space
<malay> kau ada problem <malay> tak lepas tu dia orang letak space [a'ah] [lah] [sia] <malay> dia orang pun tak boleh
so <malay> dia orang boleh [ah] <malay> pasal dia orang tak letak space <malay> aku letak space <malay> tak boleh
[sia] [lah]
<malay> kau imagine <malay> tiga empat jam aku duduk depan computer <malay> [dah] pukul satu pagi aku tak is <malay> apasal tak boleh [ah] <malay> aku
<malay> garu kepala garu garu garu [ah] <malay> tak apa [ah] <malay> mandi [ah] <malay> mandi [dah] habis mandi solat [ah] okay okay relax <malay> sikit relax <malay> sikit
<malay> lepas tu continue <malay> buat kerja buat buat buat [eh]
<malay> apasal [eh] <malay> aku stock <malay> aku break down I rewrote my code like three four times
I break everything to everything down okay <malay> apasal ini input <malay> tak boleh ni ni input <malay> kalau aku tulis macam gini boleh ke tak then
ya [lah] so so that's what I I was trying to do [lah] so I break everything down I run bit by bit okay <malay> dari gini
<malay> kenapa tak boleh [eh] okay <malay> aku perasan aku tulis macam gini boleh aku tulis macam gini
<malay> apasal tak boleh [eh] then I found out [eh] okay <malay> aku kalau tak tulis dengan spacing
[eh] <malay> boleh [lah] [sia] <malay> aku tak [eh] <malay> pukimak irritating <malay> apa satu white space or because of one spacebar
<malay> dia kirakan kasi aku error
<malay> dia tunjuk dia tunjuk but but then what they're showing is right
they're showing that there's a my string cannot be converted into an integer
because then after that they said it cannot be converted into an integer of the input twelve comma
then I'm like <malay> apa [sia] twelve comma <malay> tak boleh convert into integer
twelve comma <malay> boleh apa
<malay> habis tu it's because <malay> tahu aku letak twelve comma two comma eight
because that white space right that white space <malay> kirakan anything after that space bar everything will ignore
so it takes up it takes in twelve with the comma so of course [lah] comma cannot be converted into an integer
ya
<malay> aku macam [sia] [lah] <malay> kau orang kau orang just <malay> bunuh aku [sia]
four hours [ah] <malay> lepas aku masuk lepas tu aku [dah] baring aku [dah] baring [dah] masuk katil baring pukul dua two two [ah] two [oh] five <malay> gitu

I stopped playing for a while [oh] no I also played Halo two at my friend's house a lot ya that was like cause you know I got primary school <malay>punya</malay> clique [kan] then <malay>kita</malay> used to go to his house like my friend's name is #hadziq# then we used to go to his house during the holidays then we would go there and we would play Halo two then how it works is that you know the screen then on top got the like player one then below got player two so it was a split screen then <malay>dah kecil</malay> [kan] then my like you can see the difference between people's proficiencies side by side then like I was running around trying to find my friend right cause I wanna shoot her then she was she was walking then she stop then she had to turn the other controller [eh] the other what do you call it joystick ya she had to turn the other joystick and then she walked then she stopped then she turned the joystick so she cause she couldn't like like like coordinate her hands or something so ya I ended up beating her a lot so
no it makes sense
it's pretty normal [lah] I think to be honest the only reason why my like
like he really he really <malay>suka macam</malay> game game [lah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> then he will always buy stuff like new games or like he'll put like emulators (uh) into his computer and stuff then you just attach the
controller ya then he would we would just play like Street Fighter [lah] or like Super Mario and stuff then he will lend me his game boy then I started playing Final Fantasy when I was like six but you know like at that age you don't even understand what's going on so I wasn't really good at Final Fantasy [lah] I didn't understand the strategy then like until this year also I don't like strategy games ya but then cause of that like I got used to the controls like from a early age I guess then on top of that I used to do sports like you know in primary school (uh) like I used to be from floorball ya you know cause I did ya you know I was team captain also like but that's just because the rest of the team didn't care but that's besides the point then
(err) I guess cause of all of that my hand eye coordination got
better like it's pretty good [ah] I don't know if it's still that good now I guess it's just I got used to it you know <malay>dah biasa</malay>
[oh] I I played I played COD like a long time ago cause it got boring it's just you refresh the round then after that you like shoot people and then it's like the same cycle ya so now I play PUBG ya with #riti# but I used to play PUBG in secondary school also it was (uh) like cause the other girls in class they didn't really play games then I was I was (uh)
one of the girls or like there was another girl also [lah] like I think #shahira# used to play games a lot also but basically she and I
would sometimes play with like the guys in class cause my classes
the ratio was really off it was like twenty girls ten guys or I think nineteen girls eleven boys something like that ya it's pretty bad then they will always play together then I also was interested [lah] then one time they <malay>ajak</malay> me then like like we started playing together then that's why they taught me how to play PUBG
but I felt kind of bad [lah] I was quite a team burden back then but that's just because (uh) I wasn't used to the game I think but it was really fun <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) <malay>selalunya selepas</malay> exam or <malay>selepas sekolah</malay> then <malay>kita</malay> just you know there's like convenience stores usually right ya then we would go there then <malay>kita makan sama-sama</malay> then after we finish like eating then we just play PUBG together [lor] it was nice it was like one of my favourite memories from ya ya it was damn [ah] it was really nice [lah] I like thinking about it
B ya
[ah] ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya the Switch is sort of like a
combination of a lot of their own consoles they just kind of improved on the design <malay>sikit-sikit</malay>
Taken [oh] Taken is a pretty good game though I my brother had a then his he had like a bunch of games I'm not sure if they were pirated or not cause like he pirates a lot of stuff not even gonna lie like even my games on my were pirated I think ya but he had like ben ten and like some other few games but I don't I don't remember the rest ya but ya I really I really really like the just because it was so easy to bring around you know ya
basically more or less [ah]
then
[oh] shit
ya ya ya correct correct correct
funny story right I the first time I saw Mortal Kombat was when I was like
four four four or three it was I was super young then I went to (uh) my #makcik's# house <malay>siapa</malay> [eh]
my first sign of childhood trauma
but
I think so I think he's like the main character in one of them or is it all of them I don't even remember the plot to be honest
(mmhmm)
ya actually I stopped playing that Tetris game I think cause I got I got
bored of the loading screen cause like to wait for a new match is quite sometime right
quite long right ya so I think I stop playing that I was thinking about getting smashed
ya so I think I stopped playing that I was thinking of getting Smash also though like I don't know I didn't know if it would translate well onto the Switch Lite or not cause I know a lot of people would prefer to play it like on the screen then some more like <malay>kalau</malay>
your friends come over or something then you know you would want to play on the big screen together I guess so that's why I didn't get Smash ya I got Mario Odyssey instead ya and then I ordered (uh) Stardew Valley the one that's <malay>macam</malay> (uh) Harvest Moon ya but I ordered it like what two weeks ago or a week ago then the store hasn't contacted me I need to them on Facebook I think
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>aku beli kat</malay> (uh) you know
ya then <malay>dia orang ada</malay> website [pe] so I just searched up the game there then <malay>aku cari cari cari</malay> and I think <malay>kena</malay> like they have to ship it out from somewhere else then like <malay>aku faham</malay> [ah] like it takes awhile to ship stuff over to singapore but like two weeks is a bit of a long time then they never contact me then they said like I went onto the website yesterday in class then I was like (uh) searching if they had like any issues with the shipping cause of COVID right then (uh) apparently if the store doesn't contact I need to contact them either on Facebook [lor] I need to email then I don't know do you think it's better if I email or if I on Facebook
[kan] cause I think
if I send an email also maybe <malay>tak baca</malay> that's the thing right I ordered a day six album like in
march like it was the start of circuit breaker I think ya so like around march then it's the
days gone by <malay>punya</malay> era like the retro <malay>punya</malay> [ah]
<malay>aku</malay> order <malay>march</malay> [kan] then <malay>sekarang dah</malay>
like <malay>dah nak dekat</malay> november
I haven't gotten it at all they haven't even confirm no they confirmed my order already but then they never like updated me after that aku rasa dia orang terlupa</malay> like I really feel like they forgot about my order but then I like I really keep meaning to email them I always forget in fact I've already ordered another album and I already got that album but like I still don't have the previous album that I ordered
ya so I need to
email them about it cause now they have my thirty dollars
(uh) it's on Carousell but then like they're an official website they're they're not sketchy [lah] to be honest they're like quite well-known it's house of K-pop
ya but I don't think they meant to scam me [lah] I think they just genuinely forgot about it then (uh) I need to get a refund probably but I've already waiting so long then <malay>macam</malay> #paiseh# <malay>sikit</malay> to you know
like email them I guess I don't I don't even know what I should say what should I write in my email
ya they gave me the order number ya
(mm) I guess so
no no no the signed one got cancelled cause that time two members went on hiatus ya I didn't I ended up not buying that [one]
ya
that [one] I only got
I decided to buy two normal versions
ya then I just pre-ordered it [orh] ya
something
I know right it's so like you kind of question like what they actually do in the army and then like you know sometimes they get the idols to perform also inside the army it's quite entertaining though especially when they like come together [oh] it's super entertaining
ya ya ya I think so
I don't know maybe
maybe cause they have more people so it's more spread out I guess then maybe that's why they got more time to enjoy enjoy <malay>sikit</malay>
ya
I don't know it's very weird also it's very weird to think that like our friends are going to go to I have some people enlisting in like I have some friends enlisting in
january like even before my birthday [seh] then ya it's it's so early I mean it's good [lah] <malay>maknanya</malay> like they get to
(uh)
like
what is it they ya they get to get discharged earlier but still it's kinda sad then I can only see them on weekends ya
(mm) but my closest guy friends haven't gotten it yet though know like #set lin# hasn't
gotten it
ya ya ya maybe he'll get for april or something maybe that's why they haven't sent out I don't know I don't know how works
<malay>abeh kalau bukan</malay> april what's the on after that
I think I think I understand what the commando thing is because #set lin's# brother was like commando in ya in it's kind of ironic because they're not singaporean but you know as in like they weren't born in singapore ya ya they're burmese [oh] ya ya ya ya ya that's why his name is so weird #set lin# ya then um they became singaporean like they got singaporean citizenship then his brother was commando then (uh) if I'm not wrong right they are the ones who are most likely to risk their life when it comes when it's like going to be war [lah] like they're the ones doing the more dangerous stuff so that's why like when people do that's what that's that's usually what they think about [lor] it's like do I really want to risk my life for this certain role it's a good role like there's a lot of honour that comes with it but also like a lot of thought [lah] like what if singapore actually does goes go to war then you know <malay>macam sedih</malay> [lah] to see to have your mother worry about you you know while they're back home ya then I remember at HeadRock
forgot his name one of the malay the one that
used to that you saw at Don Don Donki
do you do you know
[ah] ya ya ya him he and
#saz# were in what is it called [ah] infantry in or something ya then that [one] also is quite
I think it's it's like something like commando but I I don't know what's the difference [ah]
then you know #saz# also was like a medic sort of like he he he was really good at doing first aid and stuff then back then when we were doing part time he will explain to me like what to do with different people like for different injuries what you should do what
methods to apply or something ya infant is like the man
[orh] is it
I don't know I just watch war movies and I watch people die and I I don't really know the like the specifics
ya ya
malaysia <malay>tak tahu</malay> honestly <malay>tak ada</malay> [ah] thailand thailand <malay>dia orang macam</malay> draw lots [sia] I think I remember cause <malay>apa itu</malay> #bam bam# went to thailand back to thailand then he was or was it ten they were like sitting together then they were like waiting for it to happen then they just draw draw draw draw the lots then after that end up both of them don't need to go
when it happened it felt <malay>macam</malay> hunger games [seh] honestly like why don't you just drawing why why do you gather everyone there to draw lots like just do it like I don't know in an office then <malay>hantar</malay> letter <malay>kirakan</malay> like so
so <malay>pelik</malay> to have everyone there <malay>macam</malay>
then they don't have
I think
what I read about was that japan back then [lah] don't know if it's still like that now like in history um they really train on mental resilience and then like they would they really drive the nationalism into like the soldiers so that's why
like the
(uh) what do you call it the the one that the people that sacrificed themselves in the warplanes
I think so ya ya then like those pilots they were willing they knew that they were gonna die but they willingly volunteered themselves to like drive drive the plane into the ships ya like because they at the back of the heads they're like yes I would I would love to die for my country cause like for them it's like I think of honour I guess I think singaporean culture doesn't really have that but japanese people I think korean people also [ah] they are very strong about their honour then like that's even that's also why they taught soldiers how to commit #seppuku#
ya it's like you start from the right then you left then you go up then like your guts will literally spill out of you ya (uh) I remember after the war I think after certain battles [lah] if they lost right they would just commit #seppuku# and die
ya can you imagine that like
you are so devoted to your country to the point where you would rather die than just
ya than just lose the war it's it's quite intense
ya in general cause I watch so many war movies right war was just terrible man it was terrible for everyone and
a lot of people
I think the saddest parts are when
people die not even cause they were fighting but they were they just got like diseases and stuff I I was watching this story atonement ya then the guy (uh)
are you are you gonna watch the movie
okay well then the guy died of
septicaemia or something which is basically when like you have a wound then (uh) there's like bacteria and it infects your wound and then like basically you just
(um) I don't know [ah] it just
ya then because of that they just can't breathe or stuff or something ya
ya so he died like that and he died on the last like before the last ship back home
ya it it was really sad [lah] so when he died and then the wife not the wife but like the girlfriend I guess
(um) she died too but it was because of
no it was cause of a bombing and then she tried to hide in a train station but cause of the bombing I think it burst some pipe or something and then the whole train station got flooded
ya so that's how she died then so they both died before they met each other again
ya it was a really it was pretty sad [lah] but I didn't I didn't cry that much I think cause
that wasn't the main message of the story ya but it was pretty sad
[oh] <malay>yang</malay> (uh) grave of the fireflies
<malay>itu sedih gila</malay> [sia] no it's because <malay>macam</malay> it's
it's so realistic to the point where it's not it's not like you know you're not like watching a movie anymore it's like you're really there so that's why it really broke my heart
that's why and he was really trying his best to take care of the sister you know then it's just #suay# [ah] the sister ended up dying of malnutrition
[a'ah] [a'ah] [a'ah]
<malay>sedih</malay>
it's not even not even an entree
it happened in nineteen forty two-ish ya
(um) I think
my mother's generation is like one of the last few
to have experienced effects of the war
[a'ah]
my (uh) <malay>apa itu arwah nyai</malay> (uh) she came from indonesia then <malay>dia naik</malay>
<malay>aku ingat dulu</malay> [kan] it was like a big ship like a big ship then she just hopped on and then she rode to singapore but no she <malay>naik sampan sampan kecil dari</malay> indonesia <malay>jawa</malay> like she took that <malay>sampan</malay> all the way to singapore with like I don't know one like a few of my aunts and uncles my mum wasn't born yet my mum was born in singapore then she came all the way to singapore ya then like my <malay>arwah datuk</malay> was a security guard or something ya
then (um)
I think
she told me during the war like they the japanese would always like seek out very pretty girls ya so like she knew like her neighbours they would purposely <malay>macam apa</malay> [eh] (uh) mud ya they would take mud and then they would just rub it on their faces trying to make themselves look very very dirty cause they don't want to look like appear attractive to any of the japanese soldiers [lah] then that was quite scary then had to ration out food also that was the worst then you know my mother she used to I don't know [lah] like like they were really it was really really like they were really poor
then <malay>makan apa-apa</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>cari dapat daun ke apa</malay> then <malay>ambil</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>makan</malay> [jer]
ya then she but they always tried to have <malay>lauk</malay> [lah] like (uh) even back then you know
(uh) like
in canteens or something people <malay>selalu makan nasi taruk kicap</malay> [kan] but
like even back then I don't know why [ah] but that family of theirs they never did that they at least have like one <malay>kuah</malay> to eat together ya cause I think
even though they were poor my <malay>arwah nyai</malay> didn't want them to feel poor you know like at least have something [lah] had something there to eat together then ration out [lor] as much as possible ya
serious it was it was a <malay>sampan kecil aku</malay> I swear I <malay>ingat</malay> I thought it was like gonna be a really big ship then I talked to my sister about it then she said you realise it was a <malay>sampan</malay> right like it wasn't a big ship then I was like !huh! how she fit inside the <malay>sampan</malay> then she said [oh] like the same way everyone else does [ah] you just squeeze together then just hope for the best [ah] then can you imagine how many days that would take from freaking indonesia all the way to singapore on a sampan with other people some more
and she did she barely took anything with her I think he just took like
some clothes then like her money [lor] then she just came to singapore I mean
I don't know I don't know how they got the house but ya
it was (mm)
before the war I think
it was ya it was like a year or two years before the war
then ya then she came to singapore I mean either way they would have gone they would have gone to indonesia anyway ya but it's okay [lah] if my <malay>arwah nyai</malay> didn't come to singapore in that <malay>sampan</malay> I would still be
<malay>jawa</malay> so
that's why I'm glad I'm not though ya
[ah] ya ya ya it's they they don't even like to acknowledge it [lah] to be honest and then they I think everyone knows already [lah] but like they put a lot of money into giving japan this new image and then like you know just showing off their culture and everything ya
but
but my mum a bit <malay>merepek</malay> [seh] like you know that time japan kena tsunami and like earthquake it was pretty bad right the
I think so the magnitude of nine or something ya then my mum was like [oh] this is
(uh) <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
ya it's like karma for what they did during the japanese occupation
ya like I mean sure I guess whatever you believe in but it's still a bit insensitive to say it while it's happening
ya ya correct correct
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>macam tak kena</malay> [ah] [ah]
(mm) I was watching unsolved mysteries on netflix then they were talking about this one town there also got affected by the
(err) what do you call it the tsunami ya then um it washed away a lot of people basically and a lot of people that I think in that region alone fifteen thousand people died ya and it wasn't a big town it was maybe their population was
(mm) okay [ah] four hundred thousand but but still fifteen thousand out of that much is still quite a lot right then (um) there were a lot of people saying that they saw a lot of the spirits of the people who died ya but weren't like harmful [lah] they were more of like they were very lost like a lot of them said that like the <malay>hantu-hantu ini semua dia orang</malay>
like they didn't know where to go cause they didn't know that they died cause it was all so sudden right then especially taxi drivers whenever they were driving around right (err) like usually nighttime they will find people who are just like in the middle of nowhere then they need to go they want to go back into the town where the tsunami happen
then like
they will stop
near the town then when they turn back the person is not there anymore
ya
something like that it's it's I guess it's kind of a spin off version of buddhism not not to say it's like not to be disrespectful it's just that it's something like that ya
(uh huh)
[ah] [ah] [ah]
ya
[ah] ya it was in
in two thousand three ya ya
I
I may have watched a malay drama about it like this girl was a victim and then she moved like she became like I don't know [ah] she had foster parents or something then she grew up with them then you <malay>kahwin orang kaya</malay> or something I don't know but anyway cause of that I learnt more about the like the thing that happened ya it was really bad like it devastated
like the whole
I don't know how I don't know what you call it I guess town ya and after that a lot of people have like trauma of just even showering
you know cause of the water and then like <malay>kasihan</malay> [lah] cause
a lot of people lost their my parents their grandparents then you know like if even like you can't even retrieve
your
serious
like he got pulled in to the water ya then I think I don't know [ah] maybe the mother ran in after him a
ya but I know that I think they died ya
it's pretty sad [lah] that's why it's quite fortunate that we live in singapore like okay there are a lot of cons also but at least we don't we really are quite safe from
(uh) natural disasters
ya
I think <malay>belum</malay> [eh]
[ah]
that's so creepy
!eww!
there's like similar stories about this in the basically like they people move into new houses right then you know houses in the are freaking huge like if you watch renovation stories right dude their basements are the size of like a flat you know and that's just one floor and it's the bottom floor so their attics they also have like attics and stuff then got stories of people they just move in and then they hear like like I don't know [lah] footsteps around the house right then usually I think people would usually think like a ghost or something then but then they they wouldn't believe it [lah] so they think [oh] maybe just the pipes or something but then people find out that there are like people living in their attics and when they're not awake or something they'll go down and then they'll eat from their fridge or something then they'll go back up into the attic to hide ya then I remember one girl she was showering or something then she heard the person climb down ya then I don't know [ah] I don't know how it happened but she managed to call the police then the police arrested the guy
ya then I think the guy was living in her attic for what [ah] year ya a year since she moved in and she didn't notice at all like that's so creepy I cannot imagine having just this random person
in your house like don't don't even know what he's doing
actually ya actually ya ya ya ya ya but in a more
ya less (um) #murdery# kind of way
it's so insane I cannot stand away you can do you know what what higher speed said I cannot sit cross country and no [lah] I mean
I don't know [lah] I mean
(mm) I guess has to do with like their amendments and stuff ya
(mm)
ya I can't imagine people our age voting a lot of people I know didn't even keep up with the
like parties and stuff ya I mean it's not bad [lah] it's just that it's not necessary you know I think it will only work in
countries like america I kings or like okay [lah] maybe it will only work for work in favour for her talent like other workers party basically any party that's not P P
I guess or like okay [lah] maybe it will only work for work in favour for the I don't know worker's party basically any party that's not
cause
(mm)
ya (uh) for I read somewhere I think on reddit (uh) <malay>ada orang kata bila dia tinggal kat zone</malay>
I think
then they moved to a zone
that was under
was it a worker's party or another party [lah] like you can tell that the residents residences are different like the way they are decorated [ah] like it's very different and then I think it's like the one
under had more amenities or something ya or it was decorated nicer [lah] but at the same time it's also because has a lot of financial backing cause since they're the super majority so it's kind of like a grey area of like maybe they do want to do a lot more but they just don't have the means you know then it's kind of like I don't have the means to show you but I can show you I can't and at the same time you know (mm) politics <malay>macam</malay> confusing ya
(mm)
true
I don't know I mean my friend is taking political science now so by the time I can vote I'm just I'm just gonna ask everything then I'll follow her her guidance we live in the same also like she lives what
two blocks away from me ya so I'm just gonna trust her instinct
it is it is ya actually got her she did she got her first essay back already she did really well she most people she said most people only got a B for that paper then she got then only three people like their professor gave an A then she got an A minus then she was so happy I'm so proud of her
I think it was about karl marx and just his communism idea ya
ya no really she had to like read the book or like some excerpt from the book and then she had to write a whole essay about it like two thousand words
ya
[ah] but nah uni sounds so exciting can't wait to do stuff like that
dude I cannot believe it and she's like the one of the youngest [ah] ya
I don't know why she went to when she could have gone overseas though I guess why she just wants to be back here since she was overseas for a while ya but her friends from her international school <malay>ada yang pergi</malay> (uh) <malay>mana</malay>
like some went to (uh) most of them went to [ah] like some into ireland like #dublin# ya then some of them went to australia some of them went to the ya
ya international school [lah] so they're <malay>kaya gila</malay> <malay>lagipun</malay> we were supposed to go overseas
<malay>tiga kali</malay> [seh] supposed to go overseas bangkok <malay>tak jadi</malay> then malaysia <malay>tak jadi</malay> then japan <malay>pun tak jadi</malay>
I think <malay>yang paling</malay> heart pain was that we couldn't see the #tokyo# olympics cause we were supposed to if we could have gone this year then like okay [lah] <malay>memang kita boleh pergi</malay> japan any other year but the problem is that we can't always go when the olympics are happening you know and then <malay>dah</malay> [lah] like how do we how do you even get tickets to go to the olympics
[ah] ya
ya exactly like you can't even guarantee that you'll get into the olympics
like (ugh)
ya
ya
(ugh) it's just wasted [lah]
<malay>aku pun</malay> I mean like I was willing to settle for <malay>kita</malay> just stay in malaysia overnight [seh] or like for a few nights then to <malay>pun tak boleh</malay> literally a week before we went lucky I asked if we could get a refund or not just in case
ya
<malay>sedih gila</malay> it wasn't even just border <malay>tutup</malay> [seh] border <malay>tutup</malay> then circuit breaker !fuh! <malay>terus</malay> my my mood just plummeted
(mm)
[kan]
it feels like
we didn't do much this year actually we didn't but like ya I cried so much this year I don't know why too much too much happen up here but not like physically ya
then next year internship <malay>dengan</malay> <malay>mampus</malay>

ya cause I I I'm subscribed to prime right so like I I have like prime as well then I can watch it and then like he does a really good rating
so like
it's about like (uh) it's like a darker justice league like a more
like a more human version of it feels like justice league (um) <malay>dia macam untuk apa ni macam budak-budak kecil ni semua</malay> [kan] ya then the boys is like <malay>untuk</malay>
[ah] <malay>orang lebih tua</malay> [ah] <malay>macam kita orang</malay> [ah]

that's the only only reason why you should be very
no I think

if you're superficial
if you're superficial

that's why should be free
#yishun#
island [eh] !wow!
[oh]
(uh) what's the island what's the island by #punggol# called [ah]
you know the one in ya there is
there's an island by #punggol# I forgot what it's called but it has like a solitary cow
ya as in like cow
ya it's like a random cow that just stroll there I don't know how they nobody knows how it it got there and then like people go to the island and they tried to look for the cow then they say if
you saw that cow right it's like a bad omen for you that means there's like something something else nearby
you know what I mean here
and it's off it's like off limit at night
it's only open in the day I forgot what it's called [lah]
[oh] yes coney island coney island yes yes yes

<malay>cari lembu</malay>
<malay>cari lembu abeh cari cari yang benda tu</malay>
<malay>abeh</malay>
nobody knows

I think it's more interesting how the cow ended up there
I guess ya
(oo) maybe ya
agaknya agaknya apa lembu tu nak kena sembelih</malay> or something <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>abeh dia punya</malay> family member like one of the family members is like no I love this cow let's brought over to that the island
I guess what happened
[oh] wait but I mean how old can how how old can the <malay>lembu</malay> be [sia]
I think I was thinking that like
in a situation where <malay>kampung</malay> is still
present you know and then like they need so many <malay>lembu</malay>
I mean like nobody care less somebody's <malay>lembu</malay>
#kampong glam#
!wah! serious [ah] [oh] I think I heard of that
[oh] <malay>kau</malay> film <malay>kat sana</malay>

[oh] was it
<malay>nampak apa</malay> [seh] toilet <malay>tak</malay> flush
it's the one that you posted on instagram right
the one the girl with the bangs is it
right
[oh] ya I remember that
(mm)
<malay>aku nak pergi</malay> [sia]
ya
but
were they trying to colonize area
<malay>ada ramai orang tinggal sana</malay> [eh]
[orh]
then <malay>dia orang kerja apa</malay> [seh]
but is it like a relatively close to like the surrounding flats
!wah! that's cool
(mm)
<malay>tempat dia besar</malay>
!wah!
that's really nice [eh] I want I want to move there [sia]
I want to go visit
I want to visit
but is it really dark at night
so it's quite big [ah]
the place
[orh] [orh]
[orh] so you guys didn't actually like explore further inside [ah]
then <malay>waktu tu dah dah malam</malay> [eh]
I feel like she is one who's scaring people people never saw anything
<malay>nampak apa-apa tak</malay>
<malay>nampak muka kau</malay>
ya I would want move there just cause it's like peaceful I guess
like away from everybody else
away from civilization even though it's just next door
and you have friends also
in a sense
but that means the auntie just live alone [ah]
I mean alone with her friends
(um) <malay>yang dia boleh nampak</malay>
singapore <malay>ada tempat apa lagi yang</malay>
all the nature reserves [lor]
right I always thought of like going you know but I like don't want to be out in the sun
think that's why they normally go at like seven eight so
ya but that is also an issue
for
I just I just like the deserted areas I know there's like a
nature reserve near #mandai# area there it's like a hidden
hidden <malay>bukit</malay> I think
ya
then recently there's been news about it where people talk about it place it's like really unknown then people got something to explore that area
that's like really cool
ya
<malay>habis sini</malay> #mandai# also so if you're bored you can just go next door [ah] see
<malay>monyet</malay>
yes
actually I don't know [eh]
the animals all wear masks
the features [ah]
[oh] ya
they do actually
ya
they should just
let it be free
and then and then join the let them join <malay>lembu</malay> in <malay>pulau</malay>
#pulau semakau# the place coney island
ya
[oh] ya [sia] I think I think last time <malay>aku pergi</malay> zoo [dah] <malay>lama</malay> [seh] maybe like <malay>tiga tahun yang lepas</malay>
can't remember
ya I mean compared to you [lah]
I guess I mean not as if you're supposed to go every week or something [kan]
thing is three years is quite okay [lah] [kan]
ya it's quite sad
especially like the the cat enclosures
it's like
as in the big cats [lah]
they just like pacing around
cause they just like pacing around right they like big cats they supposed to be like roaming around
ya
and then they just like keep there inside what glass
semi-glass enclosure
then they just walking back and forth
just like restless
they should be free
it's still around right
[oh] ya
I forgot [ah]
<malay>kesian</malay> old age right they said
<malay>kesian</malay> [seh]
what is he doing here man
should put it in freezer right
[oh] ya that's what they mentioned they got it as a gift or something
from #yishun#
you never went
!huh!
no
it wasn't around in secondary school
what you talking about
maybe sec four [ah]
what
you probably just saw like
the construction
like some hibiscus on the floor
I think it's either here or botanic gardens
marina bay gardens
timing <malay>dia</malay> quite risky
ya twenty twenty it's exactly it's like sec four
[orh]
ya so you were looking at the construction
hibiscus on the floor
but there's nothing to look at
opening
got things inside
they open the door
fifty million what
what !huh!
as of
I thought one year
who would go to that place
I mean ya ya
it is pretty like
makes you wonder like where our money is going to
plants and #changi# airport
I think they spent at least
thirty dollars on #changi# airport
that's where all our money went to
that's why everything is increasing
yes correct
that's exactly
where all our money go to
!hais!
<malay>kalau kalau kau ada tiga</malay> wishes <malay>kau nak kau nak</malay> wish <malay>apa</malay>
ya
actually ya I would also
same I would also ask for a house as well
ask for a house
and then ask to be (uh) happy and then ask to never worry about anything anymore
I think that's a lot of like
with three wishes
[oh] shit
genie
you [eh] what's the other two wishes
a drop shipper
he will be richer than jeff bezos and then I will put him in jail
that's my second wish
and my third wish I put myself in jail for being that rich also
if you cannot imagine that amount of money
then you cannot wish
you cannot wish properly
why a
every year you'll get a new COVID so you'll be a
multi billionaire
that's cool
that's big though
!huh!
[oh] never worrying about anything
having a house
being happy and never worrying about anything
okay [lah] I change my never worrying seems like
it's it's too vague
[ah]
what would I want
[ah]
I think just like a sick amount of money to spend
ya
I think that that somehow relate back to like not being worried about anything
money is like all of our issues
why
why you wish that
that's cheating
did you see the did you see there was this video
(uh)
no it was like I think there's this kid as well
there was this guy wishing
wishing for like with a genie right then he was like saying ya I wish for you to be
free genie
and then the genie was like but if you if you were to wish me to be free then he was like supposed to be like happy for him and all right
then
I would just fade into I will breathe in and die
and then he dies so it's actually a good thing like the person wish for you to be free
he wanted to kill a genie
ya cause he hated the genie so it's like quite cool
quite a twist from like
what's typically
that three wish
scenarios you know
no but like the first two he wish on like things that he wanted and like he was annoyed with the genie cause he was being an asshole
so he wish that
[oh] my god you know you know black widow has been postponed again
to like I think april or may next year twenty twenty one
it's damn long [eh] from may this year they move it back to november
and then I guess COVID didn't die out
so it they postpone it to next year instead
so hopefully COVID better like just evaporate
by next year
cause I'm like so sick of waiting
ya
god
I wonder how
how different it will be if we <malay>apa</malay> we never had COVID
like what would we be doing instead you know
like where would we be
[oh] shit
no like maybe not even doing stuff cause you know like doing other stuff
[oh] ya
but
but I feel so much comfortable with the mask you know
cause like on days you're like you're like
insecure and all like worry about people looking at you
or like worry about looking
half ass
[oh] ya and that as well
(uh huh)
[oh] ya
I think you like got scanned use your and all that time I heard quite they like making it compulsory to use that bloody token
but like the code is already enough [what]
actually I don't understand what they need they need us to like adopt it you know like if it's like a lot more convenient for us then okay [ah]
they don't right
like it's just a back the question is to like why there's a need for it
like why they they doing this
it's it's been around for awhile
like they did did initiated the project like a few months back
and then they got done with it and then they said anybody who was interested to collect it but I guess
there were
not enough people who are interested I think now we're just it's just sitting somewhere in some storage that's why they like giving it out but
they making it compulsory to be used
but I mean who's fault is that to be like pouring all of our resources into developing tokens they are like practically useless
when like our phones is already enough right
ya it's just like an additional worry for them honestly
and it's not like they very careful with this kind of things also
think everyone's gonna drop it
if it have then I would mind so honestly
I mean
I don't know in this the idea of like being actively surveilled and monitored ya
that's the thing there's there's no
I mean like
the idea of it is like good and all [lah] but like
nothing good comes out of like being overly surveilled
as in like like from
like all these like big companies gathering all of your data and all that how we use it you know
like most of it has like involve like criminal shit you know
or like
things that they do like
reveal to us
so like we don't know what we doing with our data and shit
ya
I mean it doesn't have to be like overtly criminal it's just it could just be like
the precedence for them to like
introduce more stuff to be like
[ah]
like so like have more surveillance over us like at some point like you have to
say that that this too much already like we don't want to be actively monitored like all the time
but it's about like your
individual
privacy I guess I don't know
I miss I miss cats
ya
I just want like go to a cat
and like
go play with it no I haven't been to a cat cafe before
ya
<malay>aku suka</malay> [ah] <malay>kucing</malay>

<malay>kesian</malay>
sometimes I like my bed I'm like
[ah] I know what would be better me lying with a cat
just like cuddling
ya it is like sitting in a chair
ya
I think she's like
also like very
(uh) she's like a clean person so like the fur I guess worries her
but how
but I think I'm like developing allergies with cats now [eh]
ya cause every time I touch cats like my nose gets itchy
now
last time I don't have it now it's like very sensitive
it's quite bad like if I touch for too long right maybe like more than five minutes then
like
my nose is start itching and then I would sneeze like so many times like
for very long also ya
<malay>batuk</malay>
then <malay>sekarang dah dah</malay> okay [ah]
[oh] ya the bathing part
actually you know by right you're not supposed to bathe cats right
ya
but he had fun
ya I guess I mean he's he's not really like scared of it right is he
like overly scared
or
ya catty catty gets like really
no not aggressive she gets like really scared then I just really pat so like no I'm not gonna do [lah]
(mm) ya
you know I've been thinking about this
I how how you think we would become extinct
you know if like the presence of like COVID now and all I feel like
cause I read up some stuff right then they said that the future of
(uh) human civilizations will be like
(uh)
be like a lot of our problems would come from like diseases you know like COVID nineteen is like one of like
like a good example [lah] then they said like in future there will be more
of this this kind of like global pandemics
like not like not like (uh) like world wars like before
which is like this kind of like
(uh) issues of this kill would have like
the rest of us that's why I've been thinking about this question
[oh] no [lah] like
it's just like
ya I just like born out of like I don't know like being overly like in careless
about like taking care of our environment and all
and like
or
like
hyper capitalistic as well
ya
I think I think it has something to do with climate change and some shit also
ya like cause like the rate like the the climate is changing the virus itself is like evolving like faster as well
ya so like and then like we not really pouring like resources into
into that and like also like human-centric stuff [lah] like taking care
(uh) like people
and we're like researchers like
being put into
solving pandemics like this in the future
so like ya we not really exactly equipped for it cause like most of our
like resources are like invested into like
technological advances
or like
productivity and shit like that you know all those capitalistic shit ya
yes
somebody is stopping disease like
stop like the next the next american president
campaigns slogan will just be
stop
just <malay>berhenti</malay> in all of the seven hundred languages
seven hundred thousand
ya I mean like
I mean like technological advances these days completely fine you know it's like what technology is
used for like for now right it's just to for us to be like more like productive you know but like
I mean that kind of like resource can be like be put into like
like
like into innovation that could be more groundbreaking you know like
like [ah] I don't like solving or like getting rid of like poverty that kind of shit you know but they will rather like
spend the resources on like (uh) like growing their wealth that kind of stuff it's like
ya
you should just you should just go up there and then you just say <malay>kalau kau orang semua</malay> stop [ah] stop it
<malay>kau orang semua sekarang</malay>
<malay>hentikan ini semua</malay>
this payment
and then their all these will be malaysians
malaysians would be the new americans
what
[oh] yes yes yes
[oh] ya <malay>merepek gila</malay> [sia]
that's so sad
<malay>kalau itu kalau kawan aku yang aku</malay> confirm <malay>macam sedih</malay> [sia]
like so unjustified
like
he shouldn't just be getting away like so simply you know like it just gives like a bad message to like future
ya
to <malay>bunuh</malay>
if I was the judge I would say that
just
<malay>kau hentikan sekarang pembunuh</malay>
[oh] ya that's like really

no okay I I have a reasoning
you know why it's because [kan]
if you
okay for example you give me this assignment
you tell me it's due
okay no no no back then here was my rationale
it was because
the class is the next day [what]
why are you looking there look at me
okay so the class is always the next day right
and then whatever is going to be taught in that class is about the previous (uh) homework [lah]
the later you do the more you'll remember
that was my rationale
no [meh]
it's like
okay for example [eh] you
I don't know the
if you if you study the later later part the more you can remember [what]
until now I still do that
[ah] [lah] primary school not that hard
I didn't say it wasn't that hard
to not remember a lot of things
because the teacher make us struggle
(mmhmm)

I did that (uh) what happened was when in korea I actually encounter some things supernatural so I actually recite the quran ya
I experience
(uh huh) (uh huh) yes
yes yes
!wah!
crazy man

[oh] it's okay (um) #jurong# and woodlands not very near also [what]
[oh] what bus was it [ah]
(oo) actually that's damn long [eh] I can't imagine like <malay>penat</malay> [eh] confirm
[ah] <malay>ada tempat duduk tak</malay>
(mm)
not bad I don't think I ever took one eight seven before [sia]
like the only bus I will take
to go #jurong# is [eh]
I don't know honestly I don't know
(um) yeah I mean I go to school like I study in #jurong# right okay technically not #jurong# [lah] #clementi#
but usually like I take and bus
but then there isn't like a direct bus to my school so that kind of sucks yeah
[ah] yeah correct I take the train from #marsiling#
to #clementi# then I take one eight four
yeah it's pretty tiring honestly everytime I sit I get so annoyed because like there's so many people on the bus and they're all just squeezing to get a seat (ugh)
yeah especially like before COVID right at least now with COVID everyone like social distance and the bus isn't so crowded right but like
before COVID [oh] my god it was a mess [eh] <malay>berapa banyak orang</malay> inside the bus
honestly like I also now everytime I went to school
I'm kind of glad now that it's not so crowded but I do hate the fact that COVID exists
<malay>macam macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] like
<malay>susah nak</malay> breathe right yeah that's why I don't like wearing the mask you know it's really so hard
I feel like [oh] it's just so tiring you take more energy trying to breathe then like
walking around or running around
yeah honestly like our friendship is damn low maintenance [ah] like we took
we haven't been out with each other in like what a year
like <malay>satu tahun</malay> that is so long you know
like honestly the last time we went out that was memorable was us going to LANY
and that was fun I'm quite upset that this year there's no more concerts
(um)
yeah <malay>itu pasal</malay> [ah] <malay>nak buat apa</malay> right it's so sad [seh] like the amount of opportunities that we missed this year
all because of COVID is really damn irritating especially when it comes to like
school [oh] yeah you know I was supposed to go on a holiday in june to New Zealand
like dude that's one of the best countries
ever [eh] like honestly but we couldn't even go and the thing is
<malay>kita tak tahu</malay> [seh] whether next year you can go or not
!hey! loser
(mm)
same [oh] my god last time I always go to makan sushi and the <malay>paling</malay> best right is like when <malay>malam malam kita</malay> go driving then we go and eat Ramly burger
[oh] my god I miss malaysia Ramly burger
yeah like the vibes at night is just different like last time [ah] when me and my dad
when we went there when me and my whole family used to go right then my dad will always go to this one particular guy his name was like #azan# or something
but his burgers <malay>sedap gila</malay> [oh] my god actually like the authentic malaysian experience and I love it but like now
we can't even go there and the thing is we don't even know if he still has a business which is so sad
<malay>kasihannya</malay>
<malay>kasihan</malay> [seh] like
some people like they their only form of income is like all these businesses
<malay>habis sekarang sebab</malay> COVID then they cannot do all these businesses you know like how they used to do and it's like so sad
but honestly if you think about it right if I stay in malaysia I'll be having so much fun right now
because like malaysia is so big you can already travel from #jurong# #jurong# [eh]
#johor bahru# to and where can we go in singapore #jurong# to #tampines#
like what the heck so boring
!huh! <malay>tak</malay> best [seh]
I thought like the best part of living in malaysia would be because like you can go from one place to another
but that's not the case
(mm)
what
what so the police like
dress up as a <malay>pocong</malay> to scare them
(hmm)
actually that's quite <malay>kelakar</malay> [sia] like honestly can you imagine <malay>malam malam tengah</malay> drive
<malay>habis tiba tiba nampak pocong</malay> scary #wei# I also will turn around [seh] LOL
yeah honestly indonesians have the funniest humour from what I see on Twitter they always say like
when usually people have the worst humour like if somebody go to their house and scare them they would like laugh and stuff right
yeah honestly but when in singapore <malay>tak ada apa apa jadi punya</malay>
like it's like okay <malay>kalau keluar terus kena</malay> [ah] arrested
<malay>habis</malay> like <malay>dia orang semua</malay> like they have fun with it [ah] but like I think I'm still grateful to be in singapore
cause the COVID situation is not so bad but I still miss school
no I don't need to go like all my lessons are all online and like seriously it's so fustrating I'm so <malay>penat</malay>
like (ugh) it's so hard to focus in class you know because it's all online
so it's like you always think that you have assignments due when actually you don't then like stress <malay>gila tahu</malay> honestly
it's like you would think that <malay>kalau belajar</malay> online <malay>lagi senang</malay> [kan] but no that's really not the truth it's really harder but the thing I'm grateful is like there isn't as many exams
but I have one exam coming this thursday and I'm so scared cause I have barely studied
yeah I was thinking that exams would be online which would suck
but luckily for me <malay>tak</malay> it's like
you must go to campus but you have like a lot of precautions to follow you must like
key in your temperature like on the school website [lah] then like you must at the entrance you must show like this specific lanyard thing that you must have to enter the campus and all then [ah]
our exam <malay>dulu kat</malay> (um) like hall <malay>besar besar</malay> [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> it's all just in class
so it's like one class per classroom then the exam is there
then honestly to me like <malay>tak ada</malay> vibes [ah] like there's no
exam like seriousness of an exam so it's very hard for me to focus like I had an exam a few
like two weeks ago
and like honestly <malay>susah gila nak</malay> focus because like
I don't know just not used to it you know like wearing a mask and then it's just so uncomfortable
[ah] <malay>tak</malay> my exam is all written
for me [ah] yeah because
I don't know my course don't really have a lot to do with like online stuff or like
next sem we're going to have <malay>macam</malay> coding classes but this sem so far <malay>tak ada</malay> [ah] most of it is just like theory memorizing all so it's all on paper
so honestly I cannot imagine having the exam on laptop cause I think that would be super stressful but
I don't know I guess you have to experience to know how is your O level preparation going
[eh] but I thought they extended <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
I I don't know if I read the article correctly I never really read [lah] I just saw the headlines it's like [eh] extended
[oh] right that's true [oh] I forgot okay anyway
best <malay>apa</malay> honestly I hated like
[ah] fun fact I dropped in sec three
cause I sucked at I was so bad at it
and the thing is it's ironic cause you know how they say malays can't do math right
yeah but then I did well for maths but I can't do well for which is damn funny honestly
actually that's true I wonder is like because all my friends right they say they are more motivated at home
so it's always I feel like <malay>macam</malay> I'm the only person <malay>yang</malay> cannot focus at home but honestly I really can't you know but all my friends say like
[oh] it's so fun because no one disturb you or force you to do homework that kind of thing like it's very free and easy for them but like I <malay>tak rasa</malay> honestly
like for me like <malay>susah gila</malay> [lah] to focus at home like to juggle between like your life
and your school life is hard because you are in the same place [what] at least last time like
<malay>ada satu tempat untuk belajar satu tempat untuk</malay> like stay home and relax you know then now is like very different
so hopefully the bell curve isn't higher only everyone is faces situation as you like the [oh] I cannot study I'm stress kind of thing
but I don't know I wouldn't want to go through O levels ever again
[oh] typical like <malay>mak melayu</malay> right honestly like they are all so naggy I think it's like
they are just born with it and I'm scared that <malay>bila kita jadi mak kita pun sama</malay> honestly I don't know
I always tell myself like [oh] I'm going to be better I really hope so
and like
yeah
!hais! I just want COVID to be over it has caused so many problems
hopefully
[oh] well yesterday [ah] like I said I always stay at home right so basically yesterday I was staying at home but mostly I was studying
(um)
since I'm so used to right I stopped writing physical notes
and I started using like photoshop of my laptop to like <malay>tulis</malay> notes and stuff
and like honestly I find that it helps me to be more productive
so in a way I think
I did learn like a bit from this COVID nineteen situation <malay>bukan</malay> [lah] <malay>banyak sangat</malay> but
it did help me overall like
realise what studying methods help me more
so that's basically what I did yesterday how about you
(mm)
[a'ah]
(um) malayan council [eh] what you eat there
[oh] I only <malay>makan</malay> there like once before then I got try <malay>macam</malay> their chicken it's ironic cause I don't like chicken
but like their chicken is one the best but honestly I think a lot of people say that that's their best menu item right like the <malay>rendang</malay>
honestly I don't know I haven't gone to like arab street in so long and I just like
I miss the atmosphere that it was before COVID you know
[oh] who did you <malay>makan</malay> [ah] malayan council with
[oh] man low key <malay>nak makan</malay> [seh]
like honestly but like you said <malay>mahal gila</malay> like I still remember the
first time we ever went we were like so surprised by the prices like
<malay>memang</malay> normal [lah] cafes in singapore all the food <malay>mahal</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> like
malayan council legit like damn expensive but I think like
it's like quite serata</malay> yeah it's like the
price of the food and the taste of the food and the quality it's all matches up quite well [lah] it's just that
I don't know I just feel like it's a food that you eat every once in a while you know
no I've never tried before what does it (um) what does it [eh] what does it sell
!wow! that one sounds nice [eh] honestly I love Indomie
Indomie is so good must be you can't go wrong with Maggi so basically like indobowl just sells like
let's just say how to say high quality indomie is it
yeah I always <malay>sesat</malay> at arab street honestly like
I can follow Google maps but I'm like honestly so bad at following directions so I always always <malay>sesat</malay>
but I think like recently I went there like
more often so now I think I won't get <malay>sesat</malay> as much hopefully
well honestly
I've been thinking of all these nice food to <malay>makan</malay> but guess what I can't <malay>makan</malay> cause I'm broke I can't find a job
same <malay>susah gila nak cari kerja</malay> serious like super fed up you know I'm like so fustrated
like I keep using this app called fast jobs and I like tried to find all these different different
(um) positions and the thing is they always say like [oh] urgent hiring
that kind of thing so like obviously <malay>semua orang</malay> apply <malay>apa</malay> [kan]
then <malay>bila</malay> apply then <malay>dia orang tak</malay> get back then <malay>macam tak faham</malay> [seh] like
you say that it's urgent you say that you need people but why do you like not get back to people I don't understand
I think I applied for over like what twenty jobs already and like most didn't get back to me
honestly my last few
like jobs that I've applied for was like Starbucks Coffee Bean like to be honest
I don't even know if I want to <malay>kerja</malay> at this kind of places cause honestly stress <malay>gila</malay>
like <malay>nanti ramai gila</malay> customers <malay>habis nanti</malay> got like fussy fussy people all but hopefully like
if I do get the job I get better at it you know that kind of thing how about you what kind of jobs did you apply for
like <malay>dia orang macam sengaja</malay> right like they never like properly advertise their job scope
they never properly advertise what will be in need for the job
then only when you contact them then they will be like [oh] you have to do this <malay>nak kena buat itu</malay> [lah] <malay>nak kena buat ini</malay> [lah]
I myself don't like it also
and I just don't understand like I've seen so many job postings like I also have that Telegram thing like <malay>apa satu</malay>
<malay>satu ratus</malay>
like job postings and all but it's like okay
look through every single one I apply for like ten
then like all ten never get back to me like serious <malay>tak faham</malay> [seh]
why do you post the job if like you're not going to get back to people you know I know you're busy and all but the least you can do is like
I don't know just make it easier for people to apply especially now <malay>macam</malay> COVID nineteen
time you think like <malay>senang</malay> [meh] <malay>cari kerja</malay>
(mm)
yeah like honestly the <malay>tunggu</malay> like <malay>untuk tunggu</malay> like for them to get back to you that's like the worst part [lah] honestly
it's like I applied for Bath and Body Works recently
then they said like we'll get back to you in a week if you're shortlisted
then like <malay>fikir fikir</malay> about it right it's like
why if I'm shortlisted what if I don't get the job can you at least tell me also because like
you say a week right then any time in between that week <malay>pun</malay> you can call me you can like text me tell me I got the job
but then it's just like really just waiting and waiting and waiting and obviously you don't want to like
make things harder for yourself by applying for other jobs or waiting for another job to get back to you
so I understand your frustration [lah] like do I apply for this
but like what if the other job accepts me then I cannot take this job
and then it will just make their lives harder
but they don't even think about us they don't even tell us
like honestly I would prefer getting a you're rejected letter rather than just like nothing at all you know
I rather like also know why I didn't get the job that kind of thing it would be nice to know
so that like you can improve yourself and stuff like that but
I don't know how the working world works cause I'm only eighteen but I guess we'll see in the future
hopefully honestly like during this like you know like circuit breaker period
I honestly ordered a lot of things online because like honestly I thought about it I thought like
okay once COVID ends I can get a job and my holidays start it will be so easy for me to like
pay back all the money that I wasted during the holidays
but no I got it all wrong I thought COVID
will end in a few months <malay>tapi tak</malay>
COVID is still here and it's like
!hais! all this money that went to online shopping and now like yeah we can <malay>keluar</malay> but like barely <malay>pun</malay>
so it's like all these new clothes that I wear for what honestly
like I buy it for what I can't even like <malay>pakai</malay> to <malay>keluar</malay> and it's like so heart breaking
(mm) (mm)
yeah honestly like when the virus started in china I was like damn that is disgusting
I was thinking that [oh] they already contained it [what] like it was from #wuhan# and like they already closed up #wuhan# and everything and I thought that it wouldn't like suddenly
have this kind of spike and all then like when it <malay>terjadi macam terperanjat</malay> you know
like everything happened so fast like we were just living our life as per normal
we were like [oh] it's china's problem like <malay>kita semua ingat</malay> like [oh] china [jer] <malay>apa yang ada</malay> virus <malay>ni</malay>
like of course it won't hit singapore
like honestly I think in our heads we all thought that it would be like SARS because SARS was very contained in asia <malay>tapi tak</malay> [seh]
like <malay>tiba tiba</malay> <malay>ada berapa banyak</malay> cases
<malay>sekarang [dah]</malay> like how many one million two million kind of cases
like honestly <malay>banyak gila</malay> and if you look at the I'm so glad I don't live there because they are so like
how to say ungrateful for their position they are the biggest they are like
one of the biggest country in the world but like
their management is so bad like look at their president it's a stupid idiot named donald trump
and honestly like <malay>dia</malay> serious <malay>tak guna</malay> [ah] honestly he doesn't even do much for his country
and it's like now I see all these TikTok videos of like people who don't want to wear masks and like <malay>tak faham</malay> [seh] like
I understand wearing mask is <malay>susah</malay> [lah] but like you have to do it for the sake of your safety and other people also [what] right
(mm)
(hmm)
yeah but if you think about it <malay>macam kasihan</malay> [seh] <malay>orang orang kat</malay> because like in the end
you will look up your president [what] right
because technically like so many people voted him in to the office and all and like
if you think about it all these old people who like they don't know much about the virus cause it's something like <malay>baru</malay> to them right
then maybe they will just <malay>dengar</malay> what he say because in the end he's president [what] he is the person who does everything and has the right of way
so it's like so <malay>kasihan</malay>
and it's like
the mayors even have to step in just to (uh) make up for his mistakes like he should know that as a president
he has a lot of power and like everything he says will be taken seriously right everybody no matter how dumb or stupid like they are
it's just like normal to listen to your president [what] because they are like the head like in power and all so yeah
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
yeah exactly something that the president don't have and it's like so <malay>merepek</malay> [sia] you think about it it's like
there are still people who are saying that they will vote him for the next election when he has already
proven so many times that he is inadequate for the country
like why you so dumb (ugh) anyway let's stop talking about this stupid idiot
[eh] guess who texted me
this guy from like okay okay so
so like you know I'm super bored during school and all
it's like now I'm kind of having holidays because my exam only like on thursday <malay>lepas tu habis</malay> [kan]
so then like I started using OkCupid
then like I talked to a bunch of guys [lah] because I think I'm quite pretty
then like this guy
he's not very honestly he's like (err) tall
then like okay [lah] like good looking not bad not bad you know
then he damn funny [sia] then he ask me like stupid stupid malay jokes okay okay wait let me tell you one malay joke

yeah it's stupid right but like he was one of the first few matches that like make me laugh you know
so he like <malay>macam</malay> like got my attention [ah] then like !wah! he not bad [sia] honestly
he's like eighteen years old which is my age honestly actually I don't really date guys my age [ah]
but <malay>tak apa</malay> [ah] maybe this kind guy will be the exception [kan]
so like yeah honestly we clicked

but like I don't know he's not bad and he's tall okay [ah] not like
super super <malay>tinggi</malay> but like one seven five not bad right
(uh) yeah I'm thinking about #hudy# who is one six three that stupid idiot of a boy
honestly like I'm so upset that he kind of ghosted me
like okay [lah] I'm not like super upset about it [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> (um) <malay>macam sakit hati</malay> [ah] like because like

facts honestly but (um)
I don't know the guy so far okay [lah] I think everyone <malay>macam</malay>

it's <malay>sedap gila</malay> like I don't even like #dim sum#
but they have the salted egg yolk #dim sum# and it's like

in one day I think we will <malay>makan</malay> at like what three different restaurants and three different places
like <malay>konon konon macam</malay> food tester [ah] try out like all the food in malaysia and
but like honestly like best <malay>gila</malay> [seh] that experience it's like
like you say everything that is not <malay>halal</malay> in singapore is <malay>halal</malay> in like malaysia
so it makes my life so much easier like you know every time I go like <malay>kena makan</malay> pepper lunch
[oh] my god I love pepper lunch so much and I miss pepper lunch
yeah it was damn funny right it was like I think I texted you like we were texting right saying that we were also at the same place or something [oh] no

why I yeah you talking about wedding reminds me
I <malay>rindu</malay> [seh] like I used to love going weddings you know why
cause I want to <malay>makan nasi biryani</malay>
like honestly I just miss the wedding food and the atmosphere it's so fun like cause you know I'm in a mixed family right
so usually our wedding is like for the
[ah] like my mum
[ah] side she loves taking like she loves the indian culture
so it's like yeah we're not mixed per say
but like because like our ancestors like got some
some blood and all so like we also like proclaim [lah] but actually we're not mixed
full malay like you
but yeah basically <malay>macam</malay>
so our weddings we'll make sure that we eat <malay>nasi biryani</malay> then we will make sure that it's the most
authentic <malay>nasi biryani</malay> cause you know sometimes people try to like put a twist on <malay>nasi briyani</malay> and all <malay>tapi tak</malay>
our weddings will always have like the nicest <malay>nasi biryani</malay> and honestly I just miss all that
I was so lucky that like my aunt she managed to get married this year
in february like right before like COVID became a worser disaster
(mmhmm)
yeah honestly you know like I saw this one guy you know a son of a peach on Instagram
he always does <malay>macam</malay> poll on Instagram and then got one time he <malay>tanya</malay> which is a must have for your wedding
then people didn't vote <malay>nasi biryani</malay> I was so sad you know I felt like it was a betrayer because
every wedding has to have <malay>nasi briyani</malay> like
when I think of wedding I think of <malay>nasi biryani</malay> right
yeah and another thing that I feel like <malay>kena ada</malay> is <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> right
(mm)
(mm) <malay>macam macam pelik</malay> also [pe] like <malay>hari raya</malay> is a holiday by itself you should enjoy it totally [pe] like why would you want your wedding in the middle
you know apparently got some people who purposely do their wedding during <malay>puasa</malay> so <malay>tak payah makan</malay>
right honestly I didn't know it was a thing but apparently it is [eh]
but like how <malay>pelik</malay> is that like <malay>puasa</malay> is like meant for
<malay>puasa</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>mana orang nak pergi</malay> wedding <malay>mana orang nak pergi</malay> celebrate <malay>semua macam merepek</malay> [kan] honestly
(mm) (mm)
exactly it's just weird honestly now thinking about it <malay>sekarang</malay> COVID
(err) wedding <malay>kena ada apa apa dua puluh orang</malay> [jer] [kan]
I think
you know like honestly you know how malay families <malay>macam selalu kena ada</malay> wedding <malay>besar besar</malay> [kan] honestly I wouldn't mind
like I've always been telling myself I don't want a wedding <malay>yang besar besar</malay> because
okay you think about it you [eh] you're the <malay>pengantin</malay> right then like <malay>penat gila</malay> [seh] you must <malay>tukar</malay> outfit <malay>berapa banyak kali</malay> throughout the day
<malay>habis</malay> you <malay>kena salam salam semua orang kena senyum</malay> the whole day I don't want
<malay>macam</malay> my wedding to be full people <malay>yang</malay> my mum <malay>tahu</malay> you know cause it's my wedding [pe] shouldn't it be people <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>tahu</malay> not my mum
yeah I think <malay>yang paling penting</malay> is like the wedding it's like you do for yourself
you know how like malay families always say like [oh] it's for your image for our reputation as a family that's not how you should see it [pe] in the end
like you're marrying someone is like your happiness so everything should go the way that you want it to go you know
I also like in the future like when I get married my mom and dad will be like cool to like break the traditional stereotype and let me do what like I am happy with [ah]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(hmm)
actually that's true actually that would be goals [ah] like
yeah you did for yourself but then everyone remembers you as like the bride <malay>yang cantik yang berseri</malay> you know that kind of thing yeah honestly
yeah it's like a half half thing [lah] need to see whether my husband in the future <malay>kaya tak</malay> kidding
you know <malay>macam</malay> like (err) <malay>ada</malay> movie this one movie I forgot what the title is [ah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> best friends <malay>dari kecil</malay> then they came up with their own book on how they want their wedding to look
then like in the future they ended up having the wedding at the same place at the same day and that thing cause they plan together [kan]
<malay>habis</malay> like they in the end they ended up fighting then they weren't friends anymore
like honestly I forgot the name of the movie [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> the movie best <malay>gila</malay>
I
think no got anne hathaway I remember got anne hathaway (mm) but it was a good movie [ah] then I always think about it like
since <malay>dulu</malay> I've always wanted to do like a
wedding book but I find it like a bit tacky [lah] like imagine if like somebody find then they will judge me you know like she's like eighteen and she has a wedding book
yeah honestly like
to me when I think about the future I always want like to be special you know like
I don't think being special is important but I think like just being unique not normal <malay>macam lagi</malay> best [ah] to me
I haven't thought of children's names yet but I'm pretty sure like that phase will happen soon cause I'm like so <malay>bosan</malay> now
yeah like in singapore <malay>macam susah gila nak</malay> like get all these things [ah] honestly cause
okay you compare like (uh) prices of cars in singapore to prices of cars in
you can get a car in for like what
like forty thousand and then in singapore the same car will cost like hundred thousand something with C
so it's like I don't know [ah] like you think about it you can have all these dreams and aspirations but like
<malay>susah</malay> [eh] <malay>nak dapat</malay> all of it yeah so it's like
so much to think about in the future and I'm honestly very stressed
yeah I also think about it like (err) my dream die do right is to <malay>belajar</malay> in Australia
like I remember I went to Australia and I was in sec one then after that we went to where is it gold coast
then we got to pass by like this
(err) university university of queensland
then like from then I told myself like [oh] I'm going to work really hard to like get into a local like an overseas uni
but actually like if you <malay>fikir</malay> about it [lah] actually it's better if you get into a like local uni because technically they are better
but I just feel like the experiences you gain <malay>bila</malay> like you go overseas and all is just very different you know
then like I don't know I also <malay>pun nak</malay> migrate but then if you think <malay>macam sayang</malay> right cause everyone is here then <malay>nanti raya macam mana raya</malay> will be
so lonely because now we're so used to like the big family gathering
so it's like really a lot of to think about I just hope that like
in the future you now is now is with like global warming and all
like I'm just scared that like
is there even any world to live for
yeah that's true that's why like I'm always grateful that I live in
singapore but I don't know it's really just a lot to think about in the future and like what is important to you
but I can't imagine now like <malay>sekarang</malay> [jer] <malay>[dah] susah</malay> for me to speak malay then imagine like when I have a child in the future
I don't how I'm going to teach that child malay
like you know <malay>dulu</malay> all my family members call me <malay>celup</malay> because they say like I always speak english even though I should be speaking malay that kind of thing
then when I got into higher malay in secondary school <malay>semua orang terperanjat macam</malay> !huh!
how did you even get into higher malay when you malay like <malay>berterabur</malay>
yeah actually it's true [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
we're not so good at malay right but we're not that kind <malay>yang</malay> want to totally forget about our language
you know I'll still want my children to learn and all cause I feel like it's important
later become like you know the swastika language is it
like is it swastika
I forgot what not [ah] swahili
or something yeah honestly right that language has become obsolete
like <malay>dulu</malay> like in malay class my <malay>cikgu</malay> always say like you want <malay>melayu</malay> to become obsolete is it
how all of you <malay>tak tahu cakap melayu semua</malay> then like I think about it like true [seh] like
[oh] sanskrit sanskrit
al like it's really gone
like nobody even speaks it anymore nobody knows how to write it and that kind of thing so like
how can a language just disappear <malay>macam sedih</malay> [kan] like you grew up with it and then like suddenly one day you see nobody speaking malay
so it's like yeah thinking about that kind of scary
so I will try my best to improve my malay <malay>sekarang</malay> I don't know
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
yeah honestly <malay>faham</malay> [ah] like <malay>hari raya</malay> is very like

alright
alright #mahirah#
yo hi alright alright it's good it's good okay so today's topic will be beauty in everyone
[ha] <malay>nampak</malay>
beauty in everyone okay this is a
topic <malay>ni berat</malay> [eh] topic <malay>ni</malay> is very this topic is <malay>orang kata</malay> very wide <malay>dia punya</malay> spectrum is very wide that means we can talk about a lot of stuff doesn't need to be just beauty in terms of appearance <malay>tapi</malay> beauty in terms of everything not just
(uh) look wise <malay>tapi</malay> beauty in (uh) nature beauty in personality beauty in
there's a lot this topic is <malay>memang kita boleh</malay> counter bad or good we can counter about this so it's a really good topic I would say for the first
(uh) time <malay>kita berbual</malay>
so okay <malay>kita</malay> start <malay>gini</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>kita</malay> start with the first one is
what is the definition of beauty to you okay <malay>kau kau</malay> start <malay>dulu apa kau punya</malay> definition of beauty <malay>pada kau</malay>
yes
okay
[oh] that would <malay>tu bagus tu</malay> yes that that is <malay>bagus</malay> (err) <malay>bagus bagus</malay>
for me
for me okay aku</malay>
I don't see myself as <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> victoria's secret <malay>punya</malay> type <malay>punya ke lawa memang tak</malay> [lah] <malay>memang</malay> not even near that [lah] but because I I have my insecurities (um) based on appearance <malay>juga</malay> which <malay>itu pun</malay> is another topic [eh] <malay>kau kau pun tahu kita kau pun tahu</malay> about me about
but but what can I say is that
beauty to me is not really appearance beauty is how you treat someone
how the your personality how the behaviour whether you are kind you are humble I think that is the overall beauty which
which people in our society is blinded by that <malay>sebab</malay>
standard <malay>kalau kau lawa orang pandang kau</malay> people will look at you and then they say but that doesn't mean that your personality is good that doesn't mean that your attitude is good so that is what
is the thing that we're gonna go deeper soon
<malay>tapi</malay> for me beauty <malay>kalau kau lawa pun mana pun</malay> but if your if your attitude is <malay>macam gitu</malay> then
then <malay>memang</malay> you know what I mean
<malay>memang tak boleh tak boleh dianggapkan</malay> as beauty overall and it it this is our perspective <malay>ramai orang ada</malay> different <malay>punya</malay> perspective but we're we're not gonna touch on that but we can just (uh) it's between the both of us what is our definition
<malay>boleh boleh</malay>
beauty in a long term !woo!
(mmhmm)
true true true
ya
in the youth ya true true
so
(mm)
<malay>betul</malay>
[oh] okay for me my <malay>kawan</malay> the friends that I go like the friends that I <malay>cari atau dapat</malay> it's okay we we can talk about poly ya <malay>kita punya</malay> poly days is <malay>kita tak</malay> I I don't see like [oh] <malay>kau lawa</malay> I'm gonna be friends with you no no no no I never <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>kau lawa</malay> I was going to say you no no no no I never <malay>sebab</malay>
I mean I don't know for me <malay>memang</malay> I don't see
like okay because you are pretty I'm gonna friend with you because you are handsome I'm gonna go to no I rather I rather not
go towards that <malay>sebab</malay> it's not gonna be a genuine <malay>punya</malay> relationship you know
<malay>sebab</malay> it's just gonna be
for clout <malay>macam</malay> you know you know some people (uh) there there is some (uh) cliques <malay>ke apa</malay> whatever in school <malay>yang macam</malay> okay <malay>sebab kau lawa kau</malay> popular I'm gonna to go to you because
I'm gonna get that that that popularity I'm gonna get that that fame <malay>dia ada</malay> attention so I think is there a generation that can is there a genuine relationship that can that can last you know
which is <malay>memang</malay> maybe not because during after <malay>kalau</malay> your your school is is done then that's it will you ever meet the person <malay>yang macam</malay> will you know the how deep the relationship goes how deep the friendship goes
<malay>macam</malay> for me and you [eh] <malay>macam</malay> this is <malay>kita pun semalam baru jumpa</malay> [eh] we just met yesterday with our with our friends and that is like <malay>kita punya</malay> relationship first first <malay>kita</malay> start from sec one
and until now it last <malay>ramai</malay> of my other friends <malay>macam kita dah macam</malay> you know after that <malay>macam dah</malay> start to <malay>putik putus</malay> but with you and (err) (err) our friends yesterday it is a long lasting <malay>macam kita tak</malay> awkward [tau] and that that is something that I see down the road we are still gonna be friends forever #inshaallah#
because because there's there's the because we don't see beauty we we don't see
you know we are all beautifully in our own ways but what I what I see in friendship is that the how we treat each other you know <malay>kita punya</malay> chemistry <malay>kita punya</malay> behaviour
<malay>kita punya</malay> personality because okay imagine <malay>kalau</malay> the reason why we are both still friends is because our personality towards each other is that we care we are genuine <malay>kita takde macam makan orang makan orang</malay> you know what I mean like like betray or
or jealousy no that it it is really a general relationship that's why I find that if you want to find friends in the future
<malay>tak payah cari</malay> beauty for clout or fame because it won't bring you any <malay>betul tak tu</malay>
<malay>apa kau rasa apa kau rasa</malay>
<malay>cerita sikit cerita sikit</malay>
(mm)
go towards the beauty or
[oh] damn
(mm)
(mmhmm)
like fashion wise you know is it [oh] damn okay I think I get what you mean my my course <malay>pun ada juga yang</malay> those type of cliques that
you can tell you can see a divide you know that kind of thing
and and not I mean okay there are some there are pretty people that are (um)
(uh) handsome (uh) <malay>lelaki kat dalam</malay> my course <malay>yang baik yang</malay> humble <malay>yang tahu yang dia orang tak</malay> stuck up but there are also cannot deny that that there are also (um)
(uh) girls that they they <malay>dia orang punya dia orang macam</malay> you know they have that that beauty standard [lah] <malay>dia orang ada</malay> that
fashion wise in terms of beauty wise and and they are not they are <malay>sombong</malay> they are arrogant you know
so so <malay>macam</malay> it's a
I don't know (err) <malay>macam</malay> for me that's not the right I mean okay but it's hard you know cause you know you know they say <malay>kalau kau lawa</malay> you should then (uh) take advantage of it like you know you should your personality <malay>pun kena bagus</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> but but people people who are <malay>lawa</malay> usually you know you know <malay>dia orang dia orang</malay> I'm not going to say all but
most of them gonna <malay>ada</malay> that ego you know that ego that that it depends [lah] how you are brought up you know
which is (um) it's not it's not really a a good thing
but it's up to them [lah]
ya very subjective
(mm)
true true but overall selecting friends with with (uh) with that kind of beauty in terms of appearance is not (uh) it's not the right way to do [lah] I would say
so ya it's not
not just that [lah] beauty in terms of you know right (uh) now we are all going to that stage of working [kan] it's always <malay>kalau</malay> it's always <malay>macam</malay> you see this (um)
if there's if there's a competition you know what I mean
not just competition but <malay>macam</malay> okay if you are pretty then you might get that job have you heard about this I had experienced that <malay>macam sebab</malay> this person is sexy <malay>ke apa ada</malay> landed job
what what what do you think about that is that a good thing or
I mean that is for us <malay>yang mungkin macam</malay> of a lower standard
it's not it's unfair [what] because you should pick someone of (uh) of of talent of skills instead of beauty
(mm)
[oh] yes
pay plays an important role
(mm)
design
F&B
social service ya
true true
<malay>betul betul asalkan orang tu baik kita dah kita bersyukur</malay> [eh] I mean like as long as the person is good then by all means go ahead you know
<malay>tapi</malay> (uh) beauty in appearance or beauty in mindset like personality wise would is that (uh)
this we can say about our <malay>macam</malay> okay in the future <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak cari</malay> (um)
a a partner in life your (uh)
is beauty important <malay>macam</malay> appearance wise or the best is <malay>macam</malay> mindset or the opportunity of behaviour what do you think about this
(uh huh)
that is true of course of course first ya you will see the appearance [one] or not
ya <malay>tu memang tu memang tu memang</malay>
ada yang suka</malay> cute cute <malay>ada yang suka macam</malay> E-boy E-boy
true true true true
(uh) no (err) not not not the first (uh) judgement because because first judgement <malay>memang</malay> is just gonna be appearance and a bit of hi and hello but (uh) overall <malay>macam</malay> to to find that the quality wise for a for a future partner
me too me too
I think I think
okay <malay>kau</malay> okay <malay>kau kau</malay> share <malay>kau</malay> share <malay>dulu</malay> cause <malay>ni pun</malay> (uh) is an interesting fact
for me for me right I I got a
okay I will share you later you you share first
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
what's the point [kan]
true true I mean for me I think that is considered beauty <malay>sebab</malay> okay some people say intelligence is beauty
intelligence is beautiful so actually appearance is is nothing <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] first judgement yes appearance <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] people say kindness is beautiful to me intelligence is beautiful to me or <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> the the act of (uh) sharing <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) caring the your you <malay>punya</malay> personality that is beautiful so
<malay>macam</malay> I think beauty [eh] is is
is again subjective <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>ada orang</malay> [eh] they say <malay>macam asalkan kau kemas</malay> [kan] <malay>macam kau</malay> (err) you are clean you clean yourself <malay>macam</malay> it <malay>macam bukanlah</malay> you I'm asking you <malay>macam pergi</malay> plastic surgery to be beautiful no no I think I think ya as long as you your the cleanliness of your of your the state
(uh) I'm not I'm not gonna talk about myself (err)
but but overall <malay>macam</malay> the of how you take care of yourself <malay>macam</malay> for the <malay>macam kita</malay> how we how we like its like <malay>macam</malay> you know like we we <malay>kita basuh muka</malay> something like that you know
things like that this little things that will build up (um)
the sense of beauty <malay>sebab</malay> okay <malay>macam</malay> beauty [eh] is again <malay>macam</malay> very it can be very (um)
stressful for some people
<malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> trying to fit in inside the society that you are in you know what I mean
you know (uh) I I got this <malay>macam macam</malay> experience <malay>kalau</malay> we we talk with our friends <malay>ke apa</malay> we always like <malay>ada juga</malay> topic topic <malay>yang macam ini maknanya macam</malay> anxiety anxiety of being in a crowd of (uh) people
(uh) again it's it's about (um) <malay>macam</malay> low self esteem you know <malay>kau ada</malay> face <malay>gitu tak aku ada</malay> I I have low self esteem you know cause I do have insecurities insecurities that <malay>macam</malay> to me I find that
it's it's it's it's very it's not a good thing right you know what I mean but it's hard to get rid of it
<malay>macam kau</malay> do do you have any like (um)
insecurities <malay>ataupun macam</malay> low self esteem towards this kind of (uh) topic
I <malay>pun sama</malay>
handsome
<malay>sama sama sama sama</malay> for me <malay>sama</malay> (err) like I think
<malay>susah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
unless <malay>kita kes yang macam</malay> our confidence level is very high ya but of course
<malay>terdetik</malay> [lah] <malay>kat dalam hati tu mesti ada yang setitik yang</malay> very <malay>kita rasa macam</malay> [eh] !alamak! you know what I mean
ya
I I came across this one (uh) (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) it's a meme [lah] the it's a kid the kid says <malay>macam</malay> the kid was saying (uh) <malay>dia</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> to god [tau] god (uh)
if (uh) can you make me (uh) beautiful because I don't think I'm very smart
okay but I think <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
for me <malay>pun times <malay>yang</malay> I I I would say to myself like
if I'm not smart then at least make me beautiful [lah] you know which is a wrong mindset <malay>sebab</malay> that means [eh]
I'm I'm okay this to me towards me I'm I'm scolding myself that means I'm trying to say that
[oh] that means when if I'm beauty
if I'm (uh) pretty I will get somewhere I would get (uh) at least a modelling job <malay>ke apa</malay> you know at least I have something <malay>tapi</malay>
actually if you know this again is very subjective is very sensitive topic also
<malay>tapi okay <malay>siapa tak nak lawa</malay> [kan] <malay>siapa tak nak</malay> handsome <malay>buat apa dalam dunia ni</malay>
who who who doesn't
but as long as the person is
(um) <malay>tadi nak tanya tanya seribu</malay> question <malay>boleh</malay>
yes yes
yes
[oh] !wow!
girls or boys
I think [kan] for me okay <malay>kita kita perempuan</malay> [kan] but I I think (um) generally generally speaking [kan] I think it's the girls is it but not me [lah]
subjective subjective but but I think [kan] it's more towards the girls <malay>sebab</malay> [kan] <malay>kau tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> we have like boys and girls is different [what] <malay>kita punya</malay> how we hangout how we
again you see it's subjective because not all girls do that not all guys
<malay>pergi</malay> towards that that
that <malay>apa tu tujuan</malay> like okay I'm gonna find this kind of clique
but
to you <malay>apa</malay> to you which one for you
ya
really
practical
(mm)
ya ya ya <malay>macam</malay> in terms of gossiping also [lah] you can say that <malay>dia orang macam</malay> more towards okay maybe gaming or like like like
some other stuff which <malay>macam</malay> for for girls maybe some of them will talk about [eh] look at that I mean [eh] <malay>macam</malay> [eh] have you heard this about I heard about <malay>macam</malay> some of my friends (uh) classmate <malay>dia macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tengok tu</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tengok dia ni</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tengok</malay> you know they we they are always <malay>macam</malay>
you can say (err) comparing [eh] comparing
(uh) judgy but
that's kind of the topic <malay>yang</malay>
for you know me and you <malay>kita tak kita</malay> we don't go to that because we we have other other better topics to talk about
but but yes overall if you wanna say between both gender then (uh) (uh) most likely is the
<malay>kaum wanita</malay> [lah] it's always <malay>kaum wanita</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> ya ya but (uh) (uh) (um) to mention <malay>macam orang yang tak lawa</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> but it's <malay>kini</malay> it's how society <malay>pandang</malay> you know what I mean
maybe okay maybe we can talk about society you know <malay>sebab</malay> this is how society looks <malay>sebab</malay> to be honest who started this thing called <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) okay (uh) <malay>kau tak lawa kau tak boleh kawan dengan kita atau</malay> if you're not if you're not handsome or if you are like this (uh) or if or if you're
this of this race or something then you cannot be cannot be cannot join inside this society who started this thing <malay>mesti ada dulu</malay> maybe in history <malay>ada</malay> [jer] <malay>yang macam</malay>
okay <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>macam ni</malay> I you see it all started it's not it's not it's nothing to do with (um) you can say <malay>ni lumrah manusia</malay> [tau] you know <malay>kau tahu benda ni macam</malay> this human standard the world doesn't do this [tau] it's us the humans that
that did did did this kind of thing that it makes it into a problem actually <malay>kalau kalau</malay> we all treat people the equally (uh) got nothing to do with beauty there maybe
there will be a lesser percentage of people having (uh) insecurities there will be lesser percentage of people being low of low self esteem <malay>sebab</malay> it's how which society you are if you are in singapore okay but then
<malay>macam</malay> okay I'm not gonna I'm not <malay>sebab</malay> you get it's subjective it depends some <malay>ada</malay> some parts of the world <malay>takde macam gini</malay> but some parts some of the world
especially in two thousand twenty twenty
that is very <malay>macam sebab</malay> it's all about the fashion it's all about the the the vibe that is very is very concerning [what] that's why <malay>ramai orang macam ada yang</malay> every article is that people suicide you know
youth suicide because due to due to not being able to because due to getting bullied
ya due to
this bully term
<malay>tak payah cakap pasal</malay> you <malay>macam gini</malay> [kan] it it can be because maybe <malay>sebab</malay> (uh) you are having this disabilities which I I very pity this for people because how could you judge them how could you bully this kind of people I mean they got they they never do anything to you [what] <malay>betul</malay> [what] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia orang tak kacau kau apa</malay> or like they judge you base on your (uh) clothing <malay>ke</malay> based on your I'm not gonna say about appearance but maybe we can (uh) about also about also <malay>macam</malay> status
hierarchy system <malay>macam kaya</malay> and poor
this kind of thing is what
it's all lumrah manusia</malay> it's all (uh) human standards
which I think is
is is <malay>tak berapa bagus</malay>
<malay>betul tak</malay>
not just beauty [tau] <malay>macam pasal</malay> poor and rich <malay>pun boleh jadi</malay> problem you know because of that people get bullied people got outcast people I've seen (uh) <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam kat sekolah kita kita nampak</malay> [kan] <malay>macam budak budak ada yang kena</malay> outcast [kan] you know what I mean
this one is is this this kind of thing [lah] that that is bad for
it but it it goes with the era you know what I mean
[oh] dear I think I heard a dysfunctional something [eh]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
functional [eh]
[oh] ya
that <malay>macam</malay> (uh) the economy won't go if there isn't any hierarchy you know what I mean
ya competition (err) competition yes
because if there's no competition then if you unmoving you know we're not moving forward
that that is true that is true dysfunctional something okay you got to search for that (uh) after this dysfunction but I tell you a bit <malay>macam betul</malay> [lah] like
there there will be a president there will be (uh) our manager there will be our the boss
<malay>takkan semua sama</malay> right <malay>pekerja</malay> then if like that if like that some people also don't want to do work [what] because
there there won't be any leaders that to lead
true true true so <malay>memang ini</malay>
lumrah</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>memang memang</malay> it's the world [lah] it's just it evolve like this [lah] to be honest <malay>mesti</malay> there is there is gonna be (uh) plus minus there plus minus <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>macam kau tahu</malay> okay (uh) <malay>dunia hiburan</malay>
about okay (uh) western world <malay>atau</malay> K pop [eh] <malay>macam</malay> for example that kind of thing
usually <malay>yang lawa</malay> [jer] <malay>pun yang disanjung disanjung</malay> <malay>disanjung</malay>
usually it's it's gonna be the the pretty idols or the pretty singers that's that's gonna be (uh)
[eh] actually no actually no I think it just it just involve in the korean <malay>punya</malay>
the K pop world you know what I mean <malay>sebab</malay> in western world we don't look at beauty [what] we we we judge based on (uh) music wise <malay>kalau kita suka kita suka macam</malay> for example like
(uh) there are (uh) idols <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
<malay>macam</malay> okay (uh) like
<malay>tak</malay> I think <malay>macam</malay> it's different <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> compare we cannot compare like western <malay>punya</malay> industry like the hollywood and and also K pop <malay>sebab</malay> K pop I I it's always gonna be the most handsome idol <malay>atau</malay> the most prettiest idol that's gonna get that fame
<malay>yang lain semua</malay> you know especially when you're in a group of (uh) like of <malay>kau pernah kau pernah</malay> (uh) come across this article <malay>tak dia macam</malay> there's this one idol <malay>dia punya</malay> member <malay>tak berapa lawa</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
to me it's fine [lah] but it's <malay>ada sikit macam</malay> different <malay>daripada ada ada lain lagi lawa</malay> then all the all the <malay>macam</malay> the paparazzi right would is taking the photo of that person at the side where where the the other member that is <malay>tak tak</malay> not of a pretty <malay>tapi</malay> is in the middle
but nobody pays attention to her so there's biasness
so I think that is also <malay>rabak</malay> [lah] to be honest
[oh] my god like
[ah] <malay>memilih kasih padahal sama</malay> group [tau] <malay>padahal</malay> they are in the same group
to me I think music or acting is just okay acting is a different thing but music wise if the music is good then go ahead [lah] like like why <malay>sanjung</malay> (uh) idols that are very pretty or handsome when you don't even know them no you don't know what
their personality whether they are they good people <malay>sebab ada</malay> [jer] <malay>yang</malay> news turns out that [oh] this idol did this this idol did this it's a bad thing but then the fans <malay>tak boleh tak boleh percaya tu</malay> the fans doesn't (uh)
because you are too attached of the with the thing
with beauty with beauty they are too attached with beauty so that is bad
yes you said it <malay>betul apa</malay>
(uh) same like macam
<malay>macam</malay> you have to move on because you you know this idol this idol doesn't know you
you wish <malay>tapi</malay> okay but see this is how beauty
see this is the bad the bad side the not bad side (err) but the the the the negative side about
beauty [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
the look at the people will just support this (uh) this the group of
based on their
(uh) sexiness <malay>ke</malay> based on their face <malay>ke</malay> or whatever then then it's it's it's gonna go towards (uh) bad <malay>punya</malay>
okay not I'm not just talking about the K pop there I'm just talking I'm talking about okay perspective as (uh) the <malay>macam</malay> those those fans <malay>yang sanjung sangat</malay> [kan] it's not (uh) it's not it's not a good habit for them [what] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> right when things doesn't go their way then they they are not inside the reality world you know they they maybe can start to like <malay>macam</malay> harm or they can start to like threaten which is not a good thing correct or not
so that is the negative side [lah] about beauty but other than that
being not cannot being beautiful
you can you can everybody can achieve success
<malay>macam kau tak payah ada</malay> beauty then you you you that doesn't mean that you cannot achieve success you know I mean
<malay>tengok</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> (um) oprah oprah oprah winfrey you know she's not like the <malay>lawa</malay> the most beautiful whatever right but she got that that that kindness in her she got that skills she got that (uh) hosting <malay>punya</malay> and she can be successful you know what I mean
so success doesn't depend on beauty
to a certain at to a certain extent
some people can get the easy way [lah] but but that doesn't mean that
that everyone cannot get to that what do you think about this
<malay>yang benda apa tu yang benda</malay>
<malay>yang benda</malay> (uh) success
(mmhmm)
true true
it also goes with <malay>macam</malay> top (uh) fashion wise you know what I mean
<malay>macam kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>dulu</malay> (uh) okay <malay>zaman sekarang</malay> right you know if you were to just wear like (uh) sloppy
<malay>macam</malay> T-shirt and cause that's what I I do sometimes you know but and then <malay>kita pergi kedai mamak</malay> something like that right
<malay>kedai</malay> (uh) #kopitiam# or something like that people might like
nowadays people might think <malay>macam</malay> they they will look at us like [eh] <malay>dia ni biar betul</malay> you know what I mean like
like are you are you are you seriously going to wear that you know and that's it that's where <malay>kita kita</malay> I'm gonna feel <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) it's okay (err) but like [eh] like it's I'm just wearing shirt as long as it's clean then it's fine right
<malay>tapi</malay> get it it's it's how era goes you know <malay>sebab zaman dulu</malay> imagine if okay right now this is the the beauty standard is like this right <malay>dulu</malay> time maybe like early two thousand
you can just wear anything then you can go nobody would judge you you know what I mean imagine if you last time you nineteen ninety five for example [eh] and then you call you wear (uh)
a dress with heels to a #kopitiam# people will look at you <malay>macam</malay> [eh] you <malay>biar betul</malay>
<malay>lain macam</malay> but but right now if you were to do that maybe people will like
(uh) think <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>kau lawa macam</malay> it's fine
so see how this (uh) the the era <malay>macam</malay> how (uh) move [eh] you know what I mean
<malay>lain</malay> [eh] which is weird [eh] <malay>macam kadang-kadang macam bila kita fikir</malay> !wah!
as time goes by
as technology becomes more <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) better and more (uh)
<malay>orang kata apa lagi gempak</malay> then
this is the shit you know
there are hold on okay (um)
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
(mm)
fashion thingy
fashion okay
fashion
!wow! okay ya
but the trend ya the trend we kind of know like you know what I mean based on pictures
it's very laid back
the trend is it (mm)
true true
[oh] yes
but you are not a hipster you know what I mean (um) ya ya ya
<malay>tak tahu</malay> no no no no no I'm not talking about you as in <malay>macam</malay> those people who are who dress like hipsters they are not hipsters <malay>dia orang nak</malay> step [jer] <malay>macam</malay> they just follow the trend you know what I mean
just to ya just to fit in ya that's that's the word
I think saturated
I think there is like <malay>macam</malay> photos trend I guess <malay>kita kita</malay> use simpler (uh) simpler terms [eh]
I would say today this
(uh) of (uh) twenty twenty of the twenty first century
as you know <malay>macam</malay> around starting to see because here I feel it
it's not (um) it's because (uh) as technology evolves we evolve
you know what I mean <malay>sekarang</malay> (uh) is we are living in the world where
social media is a thing is (uh) <malay>macam</malay> instagram you see what people post you might want to follow you know what I mean
(uh) facebook twitter youtube
(uh) this kind of thing (uh) <malay>macam</malay> pinterest (uh)
<malay>dulu</malay> tumblr okay tiktok <malay>sekarang</malay> tiktok [kan]
<malay>sekarang</malay> tiktok where
the you you I mean you we see everyone's <malay>punya</malay> life you know what I mean
all the youtuber all the your favourite idols <malay>ke</malay> your <malay>punya</malay> favourite <malay>punya</malay> artist (uh) kim K <malay>ke</malay> whatever you can see through just from your phone or your
you know what I mean so <malay>maknanya</malay>
due to that that's why (uh) people are like following <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>macam</malay> E-boy E-girl you might not be an E-boy E-girl <malay>tapi</malay> you just want to fit in or you just wanna ya you wanna look cool
<malay>tapi</malay> to me I think
you can you can follow whatever you want <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you have that mindset of because I wanna look cool I think that is not the right thing (err) you know what I mean why say you you if you want to dress up because you you you
you kind of like <malay>suka dia punya</malay> style <malay>macam</malay> some people you can we see [oh] I like I kind of like this style I want to try
ya go by all means <malay>tapi</malay> you shouldn't change your attitude your your personality because you are now in this this group ya <malay>macam</malay> that is that is not the right way <malay>sebab macam kau kena</malay> genuine with yourself [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
imagine you are not like that right <malay>tapi sebab kau nampak</malay> (uh) your maybe your cliques are all <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) going towards the the this kind of people and then you change your personality not just so if you if you (uh) if you just change your clothing then it's fine <malay>tapi</malay> you change your personality your whatever
because of your friend then it's not a good thing <malay>kalau</malay> if you change for the better then by all means go ahead because that means that is a good (uh) circle of friends that is a good company <malay>tapi</malay> if you start to <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>maaf cakap</malay> [eh] this can be very sensitive <malay>sebab</malay> imagine if your circle of friends (uh) <malay>macam</malay> smoking
then you you follow but actually you you know that is not you know that okay maybe you know that is not right <malay>tapi</malay> you <malay>buat</malay>
because you want to fit in then I think you shouldn't (uh) people like this they shouldn't do it because you should just stand for your own right <malay>macam</malay> you you don't need to fit in why you want to fit in <malay>macam</malay>
why I mean
you don't need people
you don't need to be somewhere
with people <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] I I say you don't need to get okay <malay>macam mana kau nak</malay> get this thing
you don't need to grab this thing with the people that is bringing you down
you can just go to your go with yourself or go with a (uh) company of friends that you know of of a good kind that will help you bring to that
(uh) stage you know what I mean
so <malay>macam</malay> you know like (um) you know they say there's a saying <malay>macam</malay> (uh) everybody goes comes with you but can't go with you it's like <malay>macam macam mana</malay> [eh] like
(err) <malay>macam</malay> the journey like imagine you you want to go to the next level
ya ya or or you you find someone that have that same mindset <malay>tapi</malay> you you don't
(uh)
have the same people that will hold you back
but because everyone's <malay>macam kau</malay>
needs a level up you know what I mean <malay>macam</malay> level of for the good
not because not not to level up to become someone that is
<malay>tak bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> like see this is how (uh) trend setting <malay>macam</malay>
fashion wise (uh) people are now using (uh) fewer are following the more of the K pop
it's not gonna be is is is a beneficial to a certain extent if you know if you knew it <malay>tapi</malay> if you don't know but you follow the bad company of friends ya maybe you can touch this topic later <malay>tapi</malay> if you follow that kind of group <malay>yang buat benda tak elok</malay> then (uh) then you should
you should have your own pride [eh] <malay>macam</malay> you know what I mean <malay>kau punya</malay> pride <malay>kau tak payah</malay> follow <malay>orang lain punya orang lain punya</malay> instruction <malay>ada betul</malay>
<malay>boleh boleh boleh</malay> shoot [jer] shoot
go [jer]
(mmhmm)
value is it popular popularity (mm)
(mmhmm)
self love
<malay>pandang rendah</malay> is it <malay>pandang rendah</malay> you look down on them [oh]
okay for me
as long as you know
where you stand <malay>macam mana</malay> you know what I mean like if you are going towards that big group <malay>macam tadi kau cakap</malay>
as long as it's of of a good value then by all means go ahead <malay>macam</malay> if the crowd is gonna be supporting you in terms of your <malay>macam</malay> it will lead you to a success <malay>atau macam</malay> lead you to good stuff good vibes then by all means go ahead <malay>sebab</malay> if you know the circle of friends is good
by all means go ahead <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you think there is not of good but you just want to fit in based on
the people's <malay>sebab</malay> you <malay>nak ada</malay> you <malay>nak ada</malay> friends you know what I mean like quotation <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>nak ada</malay> friends <malay>punya pasal</malay> then you go in but you know that you don't fit in but you just want that that popularity then it's that's not a good (uh) there is not a good <malay>tujuan sebab kalau kau</malay> really <malay>nak</malay>
I mean you know some people <malay>macam</malay> for me no [eh] <malay>macam</malay> for me I got this thing where
<malay>kalau aku takde kawan</malay> then I'm not gonna I'm not desperate for friends like I just I I mean you know there are some people
<malay>kita nampak</malay> I've I've I've seen this
where
they they they okay they got problem with the friends and then they they <malay>dia keluar</malay> from the group [kan] <malay>dia keluar</malay> from the clique and then <malay>dia cari orang lain</malay> immediately just because you don't want to seem alone
but but then then then like that much <malay>macam</malay> you like like <malay>tak bagus</malay> [lah] I I rather be alone you know what I mean I I rather people see me as alone
and I have my own (uh) <malay>pendirian daripada</malay>
I I think (uh) I need to find I need to find a friend because (uh) because people might think <malay>nanti macam</malay> I got problem
but I mean if you fight with your clique you can either get back to them but if it's not then you shouldn't
rush for a friend just because you wanna be you wanna have that some you wanna have that (uh) circle of friends for security purposes or for comfort or whatever but
if you want to really find a friend then find a a good one take your time to find (uh) someone that really is genuine in your friendship
same goes like your question <malay>tadi</malay> whether that loner is degrading themselves no I don't think so <malay>sebab</malay> if the loner if that loner sometimes loner <malay>tu</malay> feels that
there's nothing wrong (uh) he he or she is of a good (uh) direction even if the person is alone go ahead I I <malay>kita</malay> support <malay>aku</malay> support <malay>tapi kalau</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> you know people who are alone they might they might have problems or or stuff that we don't know of and we cannot judge based on [oh] <malay>kau seorang maknanya apa kau takde kawan</malay> you know like you don't have friends
come on that is childish [lah] I think we should all be mature enough to feel that maybe the person like to be alone because you know if he's an introvert because some people some extrovert also likes to be alone you know <malay>macam</malay> they don't want to go with the crowd cause it's
<malay>sebab</malay> if you want to go for me [eh] <malay>aku aku</malay> I like to keep my circle of friends close <malay>macam</malay> just a small circle of friends that I really call true friends you know <malay>sebab</malay> to have a big friends bigger friends in the crowd do you have to have the commitment you know what I mean and is it gonna be beneficial <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
you know <malay>kawan kosong</malay> and <malay>kawan</malay> that is really true
ya so back to your question where <malay>kalau</malay> the loner is degrading or not or
let what people think go ahead society if society doesn't like you or doesn't like what you wear or doesn't like your face or whatever right they they get did they will always throw find some ways to throw head to to to degrade you whatever but <malay>kalau</malay> you it's hard it's hard to say <malay>macam</malay> for me you know I just say but if I were to
to be in that position then maybe I'll have I'll be very self my self esteem will be very low and I will be very depressed full or whatever right
<malay>tapi</malay> what I I can advice <malay>macam</malay>
to me to myself also in the future or to whatever
<malay>tak payah kisah pasal orang-orang yang gini sebab</malay> they they they don't deserve your friendship they don't
<malay>dia orang tak layak pun sebab kalau</malay> they they judge you they whatever they insult you then are they of a good friend then no
so go ahead like (um) move forward find
there will always be better circle of friends out there that that you deserved that the person deserves
<malay>kau kalau kau macam mana</malay>
yes I I still remember our first our first
<malay>macam</malay> you you know <malay>kita aku</malay> case <malay>macam</malay> the clown [eh] <malay>macam</malay> the class clown and then and then when I okay okay for the <malay>kita ni ni macam</malay> podcast [eh] <malay>tapi macam</malay> okay for those who <malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> I'm I'm okay I won't say that I'm I'm ambivert <malay>macam</malay> I'm
an extrovert and also I prefer like alone time or whatever right but when I first met #mahirah# [kan] <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>dia macam pendiam</malay> [tau] but actually she's not you have to get to know her to know her
<malay>tapi</malay> (uh) <malay>mahirah aku</malay>
ya it take a long time not years [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> but no maybe years for somebody but for me it's a it's a connection
but no <malay>aku</malay> respect <malay>kau sebab</malay> okay you you call yourself introvert right

<malay>kau</malay> chairperson [seh] <malay>kau</malay> your leadership skill is really <malay>aku sanjung aku macam aku tabik</malay> (err) <malay>sebab</malay> your leadership is the best
so and
and those who don't know don't know <malay>tapi</malay> once you find good people right you you stick to them <malay>macam</malay> for me thank you for being
my friends !chey! <malay>macam sedih pulak jiwang kenapa pulak sebab sebab</malay> it's true it's true

<malay>macam ajar</malay> then !wah!
(um) <malay>tak payah cakap pasal</malay> beauty [lah] it's <malay>macam dia punya</malay> attitude wise you know what I mean
ya so role model
the is that <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay> if you want to say like like western <malay>punya</malay> or like <malay>macam barat</malay>
(uh) <malay>pelakon ke apa</malay> [kan] then I would say #neelofa#
#neelofa# #neelofa#
is the ya malaysian <malay>punya</malay> actress host (uh) business woman <malay>sebab</malay> [kan] (uh) <malay>kalau kau tak tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia buat</malay> this brand <malay>apa yang neelofa punya tudung</malay> and then she's she's she's successful <malay>sampai pergi</malay> (uh)
milan (uh) to the the business <malay>berkembang</malay>
like real be and and she's very #muslimah# also so I thought that she's a whole package and she's very beautiful
she is a great (uh) host she's a great actress also and she's a great business woman and that and at the age of thirty I think she's thirty right now thirty one or something <malay>dia masih belum berpunya</malay> she's still single but her driven of (uh) being that success both <malay>dunia</malay> and <malay>akhirat aku boleh cakap</malay>
it's it's like !wah! <malay>macam</malay>
it's something that <malay>macam</malay> you god bless you you know
ya I take that as a as a
(uh) role model because some more is a woman ya women and and malaysian and (uh) of a islam (uh) muslim also so ya that's that's a great thing <malay>apa tadi kau nak cakap</malay>
#wallah#
<malay>betul betul betul</malay> the I mean the the the life the hereafter [lah]
ya
okay ya it's subjective it's subjective
(mm) (mm)
ya <malay>tu</malay> [oh] my god singapore living ya
(mmhmm)
why ya true true it's hard to find someone that of both that is !wow! I think <malay>memang</malay> it's very rare no not just both <malay>tapi</malay> your character <malay>pun baik</malay> your personality <malay>pun baik</malay>
those who have that
I have the most the utmost respect the utmost <malay>macam</malay>
role model [lah] I think that is what we call role model being both are woman or man <malay>yang macam</malay> you know that you have okay for the guys handsome (uh) <malay>bekerjaya</malay> and (um) (uh) <malay>apa</malay> we can <malay>cakap apa</malay> faithful is it faithful and then (um) of a good personality then
<malay>memang susah nak cari</malay> but these are the people <malay>yang macam</malay> you <malay>risau tapi</malay> again to those <malay>yang kita</malay> okay <malay>kita boleh (uh) <malay>rumuskan</malay> [eh] <malay>sebab</malay> we got like a few more minutes <malay>tapi</malay> (um) what I can say is that we shouldn't just (um) we shouldn't just
(uh) okay what's that word [eh] I want to say that this <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam kita kita jangan</malay> just <malay>tengok yang lawa kita</malay> just <malay>tengok yang</malay> handsome you know what I mean we we don't we don't (err) okay don't pay attention okay as in like don't pay attention to all these or to the beauty of appearance <malay>sebab</malay>
it will just make you <malay>rasa diri</malay> you <malay>yang kalau</malay> you know that you are not of that beauty standard it will just make you more depressed or like social anxiety or like self esteem it it will decrease your self esteem also
so I feel like we <malay>atau</malay> whoever shouldn't pay attention to that because you just bring us down [what] like we won't move on we won't we will live in fear of being judged or being outcasts then
as long as you in order to to overcome all this right just work hard and be your this <malay>macam</malay> successful of yourself just to be a better version of yourself <malay>kalau</malay> just you know what I mean like
(um) like
there are there are other aspect that is you can prioritise more than just beauty
<malay>betul</malay> you know what I mean ya right there's the there are other aspect just just be of (uh) just be humble be kind I think <malay>kalau</malay> at the end of the day right
you can people will love you even more than just those beautiful without character <malay>betul tak</malay>
so just ya just be on that don't worry <malay>kalau</malay>
just be because at the end of the day we are all the same [lah] just human being
ya
yes be comfortable in your own skin it's hard to to directly <malay>macam</malay> choose to that but slowly slowly I think I think as long as you <malay>macam</malay> you work hard to become what you want to be and then you you your character is nice you don't you when if you are up there you don't judge the people below you because you never know <malay>bila</malay>
whatever you have would be taken away you know what I mean
so then you just be humble [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
just like just go with the flow just don't mind about all this let's have that that your pride is is to be the best version of yourself [lah]
(mm)
yes ten years down the road what what you want to say to yourself okay okay no no no (uh) okay how about before that we say
(err) the one thing we regret
you know what I mean <malay>macam</malay> we get five years back what we we regret
it can be anything doesn't need to be of like what beauty but it can be anything then <malay>baru kita</malay> move on to ten years down the road what should we
what can we advise ourself right now
for the ten years down the road okay we we gonna talk about our regrets first
ya sure sure
!wow! that is deep that is deep ya that is true
for me my regret is that
I tend to look down on myself
very low
<malay>macam</malay> it it it has come to a point where
<malay>macam</malay> because of beauty [lah] because of like insecurities and like low self esteem I tend to like
I I think myself <malay>ni macam takde</malay> value
and it has come to a point where <malay>macam</malay> whatever people take one for me <malay>aku macam mengalah aku</malay> like okay give in give in give in cause I felt like
like I should be more
affirm is it affirm should be more probably a bit more selfish
a bit earlier just a little bit more not to that be as in but just everyone to to to
to have like prioritise in me <malay>sebab</malay> I I tend to like
to like <malay>macam jaga hati orang ni jaga hati orang ni jaga hati tapi siapa nak jaga hati kita orang</malay> [seh]
you know what I mean so it has I should be more <malay>macam</malay> have that confidence which I I <malay>aku tu tu</malay> last time [eh] <malay>tu</malay> last but right now I have I work on that and it's it's I find that
(uh) the respect that you you're given by society that is more
so to the next ya (uh) future advice for your for the next five years or ten years down the road <malay>apa kau punya</malay> advice
is it is it an advice or like what we want to be or
[oh] message to [oh] okay okay
[oh] okay that's good that's good
(mm)
true
true true that is that is important and <malay>macam</malay> to just have that little selfishness in you so that
you can
you can treat yourself you can feel that you are valued [lah] in this world into serious [eh] for me my advice is that to always be nice to each other
<malay>ni</malay> is important <malay>betul</malay> okay
ellen <malay>punya</malay> ellen put aside [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> this is my <malay>pendirian</malay> I know where
and I have experience of of job interviews of people of a higher standard
higher status <malay>kau</malay> manager your <malay>kau</malay> they treat me they treat us <malay>macam kita ni</malay> beginner but we because because of our age then they they they degrade us you you know what I mean so I <malay>aku macam</malay> to me I would never treat anyone like that be it even if one day <malay>aku</malay>
have my own (uh) business or I I'm (uh) I'm the manager or have a bigger pay whatsoever [lah] bigger title whatever
treating people nice is you is a must <malay>sebab</malay> how can you judge <malay>sebab</malay> I got people around me <malay>macam</malay> they they judge okay for example
<malay>kalau kau punya</malay> job (uh) <malay>macam</malay> (uh) cleaning wise <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
I mean you shouldn't judge
<malay>kau</malay> why would you (uh) I've seen this this is another topic (err) like for me okay I just share a bit of my intern [eh] I was treated badly by the supervisor
it's because (uh) <malay>kita</malay> they can bully us you know cause they think us we are like (uh) <malay>kuli</malay> we are like beginner
<malay>kita macam baru masuk</malay> industry then they they they bully us they they not just (uh) okay if we if we are bad right if we are rude then by all means I deserve that treatment <malay>tapi</malay> if we are respectful if we are willing to learn but you you treat us like <malay>macam kita sampah</malay> or like you insult us you
you treat us badly you you you you call you are racists I I got you know a job interview and the guy was racist to me but then I felt like [oh] my god you you you you forget where you where you start you <malay>kau kau dah lupa diri</malay> [kan] this is what happen when <malay>kita lupa diri</malay> so I I I just want to advice myself that [oh] my god please
#nadia# don't ever <malay>lupa diri sebab</malay> one day <malay>kalau</malay> I get that extra money <malay>ke</malay> I get that extra title <malay>ke</malay> I might forget about myself and people below me
bad which I don't want that to happen and
because I myself experienced it how bad it is and I know how it feels like to be treated that way so in the future I advise myself that never treat people that way because you will never know <malay>bila</malay> this (uh) blessing will be taken away from you you know what I mean that's (uh)
that's a wrap

ya ya you saw my posting is it
ya that was back then [lah] but <malay>sekarang dah kena buang</malay> [kan] so <malay>tak ada guna</malay> [ah] <malay>nak tengok tu semua balik</malay>
(err) around six months
and if I would say it's wonderful [lah] cause
I got to travel to different countries [ah]
among all the countries I would say
(uh) saudi arabia cause (uh) it was very peaceful you know cause I mean I'm a muslim right so when I go there
I really I would say I practice my religion better there
so <malay>aku rasa lebih aman</malay> [ah] <malay>kat sana</malay>
[ah] saudi arabia [ah] #mecca# <malay>rasanya kat</malay> #mecca# <malay>sana semua</malay>
no <malay>aku</malay>
(uh) <malay>aku tak pasti</malay> [ah] <malay>apa pasal</malay> corruption <malay>ni semua tapi</malay> I did read over the news that (uh) ya there were some corruptions by the make government or by the royalty by the royal families itself [ah] but then
I'm just a normal person who wants to go there to practice my religion [lah]
(err)
besides practising my religion I I think I really
enjoy myself
(uh) finding [oh] discovering new food there the arabic food was
amazing I would say <malay>sebab dorangnya</malay> taste
a bit different from asian <malay>nya</malay> culture <malay>dorangnya makanan lebih masin sikit</malay> [lah] and it might be hard to find in singapore or asia itself
I would say I would want to go to
spain [ah] cause ya I would like to go to spain cause

<malay>disebabkan</malay> COVID period [kan] <malay>aku rasa</malay> no chance [lah] <malay>nak gi sana nak jumpa atau</malay> maybe <malay>kita nak tengok bola kat sini pun dah tak ada tak ada</malay> chance <malay>kot</malay>
<malay>maksud kau kat mana kat negara luar atau</malay> in singapore
so far <malay>aku rasa dorang dah main dah</malay> start <malay>main cuma</malay> it's just that no [ah] spectators are allowed in the stadium ya cause if they totally stop the football industry right the football clubs will [ah] suffer a lot of loss [ah] cause they have sponsors coming so they still had to let the games to continue [lah]
actually <malay>tu yang aku pelik</malay> [ah] but then (uh) I did make a research [ah] on the internet and I found out that (uh) they make money through (uh) fans memberships the merchandises like example (err) <malay>satu apa ni baju bola</malay> [kan] they could sell for fifty pounds and they had millions of fans across the globe [what] so <malay>kalau satu kalau semua beli mungkin</malay> they could sustain themselves in a short period of time before they actually recover [lah] you know before the
whole (uh) football period (uh) resumes
(uh)
ya <malay>aku rasa kau pun boleh tengok apa dekat</malay> facebook <malay>apa semua</malay> especially in singapore (err) aviation <malay>macam-macam kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>ramai orang kena buang tapi bagusnya</malay> (err) <malay>kita tengok</malay> singapore government they give a lot of grants and financial [ah] aids to (um) singaporeans [ah]
I I sure think that you did receive all all of the grants right
[ah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang aku</malay> rest [jer] <malay>kat rumah sebab</malay> (uh) <malay>apa</malay> to stay close [ah] with my family
<malay>sebab</malay> you know I want to keep myself safe and
finding a job at this period I mean it might be subjective [lah] but I would say it's hard [lah] [ah] you know to find a job that [ah] that is suitable with me <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>aku cuma sekarang aku cuma pakai duit</malay> savings <malay>aku</malay> [ah] <malay>alhamdulillah sebab aku dapat</malay> save for the past (err)
months that I've been working as air steward <malay>kalau tak mungkin aku kerja</malay> [lah] <malay>cari mana-mana kerja</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> actually <malay>risau juga cuma</malay>
<malay>alhamdulillah</malay> again <malay>aku dapat</malay> save quite a lot
I mean <malay>aku tak ada aku nak bilang kau</malay> [kan] but then ya I would (err) the savings that I save
probably can last me for six months [ah] if I really (err) spend accordingly and safely [lah] and how about you I heard you working as a
driver or something is it
[oh] <malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku baca hari tu kat</malay> facebook <malay>juga</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa kerja</malay> as a swabber is it they could earn like
four thousand !wah! that I think that's a lot [eh] for a part-time job
maybe cause (err) they are finding people who are willing to work (uh) a risk a risky job [lah] <malay>tu pasal</malay> they are willing to pay that much
<malay>tapi</malay> to volunteer to be a swabber I mean is a risky job so I don't think people would actually volunteer [lah] <malay>sebab bahaya kot buat kerja tu jadi</malay> maybe it's better if government pay them [lah] you know
[oh] I see ya but then
yes speaking about jobs I think
(uh) moving forward
it will be a tough period [lah] for singapore and singaporeans itself cause
a lot of people are losing jobs and they are taking a reduced pay and I wonder how people will be able to pay their bills their mortgage and et cetera [lah] you know <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>nak cakap susah memang</malay> [lah] <malay>susah tapi memang perlu teruskan kehidupan</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun</malay> wonder on how singapore would cope with this (um) COVID nineteen [lah]
(mm)
I mean be it any be it like be it any jobs [lah] you know regardless of any jobs sorry regardless of any jobs
I mean if you earn enough for yourself and family I think it's good enough
so but then ya in terms of singapore context
I think you think how much should a singaporean earn to sustain him or herself and their family
ya I really agree on that [lah] cause as we (um) you know I don't know if you notice it or not cause singapore is currently facing a
declining birth rate you know people are scared to have children cause they they are worried that it might cost them a lot
you know with the I don't know with
(err) the what diapers with the milk cost I think they are the parents will be scared you know to raise a child
and <malay>tu pasal aku rasa penting</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>ada</malay> plan [lah] <malay>untuk masa depan tak semestinya kena cepat-cepat nak kena kahwin atau beli rumah sebab banyak lagi yang kena fikir sebelum membeli apa sebelum ada anak sebelum ada</malay> family <malay>atau beli rumah aku rasa</malay>
to have a stable saving or to have a sufficient saving is very important [ah] in singapore
(uh) ya I get that a lot [lah] I mean
especially in the malay tradition right I don't know why
(err) it's very important or they really emphasise emphasise on having a
(err) you know a lot of children I don't know [lah] maybe for them it's a <malay>rezeki</malay> but in terms of singapore context
I think having one or two children is enough you know like if you have more I mean if you are financially stable I think it's good for you [lah] but then you are just earning
one point eight
two thousand and that is provided (err) you are not doing overtime or what [lah]
so ya two thousand is not enough [lah] at least two point five and above
that's why we are that's why we notice that (err) or rather we witness there are a lot of news over facebook young parents are struggling [lah] you know to sustain themselves and their family cause
I mean the living cost in singapore I mean you also know it's not cheap
and (um) the pay that they are getting is already not enough
so ya I think
perhaps singapore government could give them give them [eh] sorry give them a little bit more
financial schemes like for their own children [lah] you know maybe
for (err)
primary school children [kan] <malay>tak payah bayar</malay> school fees <malay>ke</malay> or maybe edusave <malay>bagi lebih banyak sikit ke</malay> you know
ya I really agree on that [lah] we really we don't need we need to stop blaming on the government and you know (err)
put the responsibility on ourselves first I mean speaking about the electricity right !wah! my house [ah] I'm just living with my mum and my bill is around two hundred and I barely shower
maybe I only showered two times per day I don't why my electricity bill until two hundred what about yours though
ya I think I really urge you [lah] to [ah] hustle more cause
I mean if you think probably right if you earn around two thousand and then
after you pay bills mortgage you pay I mean you give some of your pay to your parents I mean how much you're left with you know and maybe you you barely have time [eh] you barely have money for yourself and for transportation I mean
(uh) this kind of issues right might really affect your mental health you know and as you can see over the news
you know I really like to read news [lah] I mean and you know people are committing suicide cause they are really stress with their condition and
I I'm really sorry [lah] to hear that people are killing themselves cause they are really stress with their own condition I mean what do you think about that
we gotta suffer
ya I mean I I agree [ah] there are multiple aspects that (um) lead to (err) emotional (err) depression
or probably (um)
issues that can affect your mental health like I think especially in singapore context right (um) financial
(uh) issues I think is the most depressing issue [lah]
you know cause
you know you got to pay that you got to pay this <malay>aku kadang-kadang pening</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab aku dapat gaji</malay> [jer] <malay>aku kena kasi</malay>
<malay>apa ni adik-adik aku</malay> [eh] sorry <malay>adik-adik aku pula aku mana ada adik</malay> [kan] <malay>aku kena kasi mak aku abeh aku kena bayar</malay> bill <malay>aku kena bayar macam-macam lagi</malay> [ah] then <malay>aku kadang-kadang</malay> barely <malay>aku cuma ada kadang-kadang</malay> five hundred for myself like in every month
so <malay>walaupun</malay> I would say I'm not saying I'm in a comfort zone but
ya five hundred for myself every month
I I'm not happy but I'm content with whatever with !wah! sorry with whatever I'm having [lah] you know
you mean the COVID period is it or
ya I mean this is a very tough period [lah] for all singaporeans and especially for those lower income right
I mean I sometimes I really wonder <malay>macam mana orang-orang yang</malay> (err) <malay>sewa rumah atau mempunyai apa ramai apa ramai anak</malay> [lah] you know <malay>rumah mereka macam mana dorang bayar</malay> [tau] <malay>dorang punya duit makanan duit sewa rumah duit bayar</malay> bill
and if we were to put ourselves in their position I don't I mean if I were to put myself in their positions I don't think [ah] I can like endure well cause
you know having to think various issues in one time it's very (uh) depressing I would say
ya I mean I I also (err) came across the news that he was diagnosed with COVID [lah] I mean some people
(err) actually celebrated that he was diagnosed I mean maybe I don't know why [lah] I mean it's not a it's not
good to actually celebrate that someone is diagnosed I mean be it any issue or be it any remarks that you are unhappy with with what I mean be it anything [lah] that he had done that you are unhappy with I mean it's not right for you to be happy that someone is sick cause
I know it just it's not morally right that you are celebrating someone is sick you know
I mean some people might I think some people misinterpret that issue actually he just
I don't know if you heard the news he only
(um) hold the border
to some (uh) high risk muslim countries it's not to all muslim countries so I think maybe people misinterpret the news [lah] maybe might think that he's what is it you called islamic islamophobic or something ya but then
well if he is then that is his position to
(uh) explain himself but I myself as a muslim I've nothing against him
but I have something more worrying to actually worry about which is the (uh) about the uighur muslim in china
where I heard that they are being tortured
being raped which I'm totally (uh) angry about <malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun tak boleh buat apa-apa sebab aku pun duduk</malay> singapore <malay>mungkin kalau aku</malay> ironman <malay>mungkin aku akan pergi sana</malay> [lah] <malay>aku nak</malay> save <malay>dorang tapi dalam keadaan sekarang aku cuma boleh mampu doa</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak kau kau rasa kau rasa apa macam kalau</malay> (err) <malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>sedara kau sendiri</malay>
(uh) was tortured was raped in front of other people
(uh)
in my in my opinion probably they are practising communism you know probably they just want to have their own people you know in their own country
and to have other races to in their own country might
if they feel that it might be a threat to them hence that's why they
they you know hold the what what is it called the concentration camp is it where they gather all the muslims and they rape all the women they torture all the men and they
torture all the children I mean do you really have to torture the children I mean they are
they are still weak people you know I don't think it's (err) moral morally right [lah] I don't know what's wrong with their head you know to even torture all those kids I mean
<malay>tak ke tak ke pelik kau sanggup untuk pukul budak kecil</malay> I mean <malay>mungkin kalau kau mak bapa mak bapa pun kau tak sepatutnya pukul budak-budak tu tapi</malay>
<malay>ini kau pukul ramai-ramai dan kau rogol perempuan semua</malay> I really
(err) don't know what's wrong with their country
ya basically I would say (uh) history is repeating itself I mean what's happening in china is another example of holocaust in if you really know about it where the jews are being (uh) killed
(err) you know there's a mass I don't know they were killed in groups or something back then and know the same thing is happening but the weird thing is it's not
(err)
the events that are happening in the concentration camps are not exposed to the mass media and I'm not sure why it's became maybe it's cause they are muslims or what
I don't know and
ya I really (err) I'm really disappointed that (um) the muslims are treated that way and also another case is <malay>sekarang ni</malay> happening in this world is
(err) I don't know what is it called the black lives matter you know where the black people are really (err)
being outcasted in what you think about that
ya I mean in every community [ah] be it in our own country also be it in malay community chinese community indian community there's always black sheep in every community you know but then it doesn't justify that when one person from that community does any bad thing
it (err) it (err) really (err) bring a hole
(uh) present representation of the whole community and as you can see in [eh] <malay>aku tengok</malay> (err) <malay>kenapa</malay> police <malay>dorang</malay> (err)
<malay>apa</malay> treat all those (uh) black people with such violence and brutality
where recently <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> news (err) <malay>satu orang dorang siapa nama dia</malay> george floyd was killed
intentionally in front of people !wah! that was another level of murder I would say [lah]
(err) <malay>aku tak tahu apa yang tak</malay>
police police <malay>tu fikir</malay> [lah] <malay>sampai sanggup nak bunuh apa</malay> (err) <malay>orang tu dia setakat</malay> (err) <malay>apa ni ada</malay> fake <malay>duit</malay> [jer] which is twenty dollar counterfeit bills so I don't think it's fair for them to hold him on the ground and kill him intentionally in front of people
what you think about that
screwed-up
ya I think in singapore
I mean
(err) we did have I mean we do have (uh) casual or soft racism among the community I mean maybe some maybe for friends right they interpret as a joke you know as a casual joke but maybe if you are
you know being racist to a stranger I mean you're really asking for it man I mean if that person really punch you I mean you're really asking for it [lah]
you know you really deserve it I mean in but then in singapore context
I don't think such (uh) racism that is happening in america would happen in singapore cause
<malay>aku rasa dalam negara ni</malay>
(err) <malay>orang masih boleh</malay> you know <malay>kita duduk dalam negara yang berbilang bangsa</malay> [kan] <malay>aku rasa kita masih boleh hidup dalam aman cuma</malay>
we just need to be cautious in what we saying or what we think about others [ah] you know and what do you think about singapore
so called racism
if it if it exist [lah]
ya I heard that (um)
<malay>dekat sana ada</malay> this thing called <malay>bumiputera</malay> where the malays are given
the malays do have more privilege than (uh) comparing compared to other races [ah] know when they buy houses actually they actually can buy it at a cheaper price which
why
why are you living in a country where you as a (uh) national citizen are denied rights as a
I mean as citizen as a citizen of the country [lah] you know another in another citizen of yours
example okay example [ah]
you and your neighbour
wanted to buy this house at <malay>taman melawati</malay> [lah] you know in #kuala lumpur# or something but he can buy it at two hundred thousand but you can only buy it at five hundred thousand
and do you think you are treated fairly as as a citizen
that's what I heard [lah] I mean I I don't wish to be the source of this
news or what I mean (uh) but then ya that's what I heard [lah] when you are chinese indian
(uh) sarawakian or #sabah# you know someone from #sabah#
you have you don't have that <malay>bumiputera</malay> rights where you can
you will be treated better or you have a you have more privilege in malaysia and I think the malays in I mean in malaysia
actually
should be <malay>bersyukur</malay> you know they could actually get everything at a cheaper cost be it houses healthcare and and you know what actually [kan] <malay>kalau dorang gi klinik</malay> they could actually
they (uh) <malay>dorang cuma perlu bayar</malay> one <malay>ringgit</malay> [jer] [tau] one <malay>ringgit</malay> for basic consultation whereas in singapore if you go to a
a clinic I don't know you could (err) easily pay forty dollars if you don't have a CHAS card
I mean sorry to say [ah] but I think that their government
is
weird is a big joke I would say I mean do you can see the way they run their countries and I mean it can be (err) it can be seen in the news you know on how their ministers are having tons of corruption cases being [ah] you know
they are they are going to get charged in court [eh] I know you confirm know [ah] who's that guy [ah] #najib# (uh) #najib razak# and some other
his (uh) friends getting charged at court cause
they (err) they are involved in this corruption of certain companies and <malay>kau aku fikir dorang ni tak rasa berdosa ke</malay> I mean
okay [ah] <malay>berdosa tu dah</malay> another level <malay>dorang tak rasa bersalah ke sebagai seorang menteri dorang ambil duit rakyat</malay>
<malay>duit</malay> [eh] <malay>rakyat dah bayar cukai dah bayar segalanya dorang ambil duit tu</malay> and they can just buy I don't know they heard I heard that they buy
<malay>kapal apa</malay> yacht [eh] I don't know how to pronounce that if they buy diamonds it's something !wah! that's no no I mean you don't have to be minister [lah] like that you know what you think about that
ya I heard he was charged on
twenty charges if I'm not wrong and he would be in prison for twelve years [ah] but I doubt that he will be in prison cause
I mean
ya I mean let's say that he I mean he should have a lot of money as of now and <malay>mesti dia akan dapat</malay> lawyer <malay>yang bagus-bagus</malay> [ah] and he might win the case and just (uh) go off with a bail or maybe instead of twelve years he only can he will get in prison for one or two years [ah] so
that's why I really
I mean
I do really love to watch the malaysian politics cause it's funny and the way they speak to each other is really funny the way (uh) you know they
they (uh) give racist remarks which are the I mean I don't find it funny [lah] but the way they speak it and also they shout to each other
but ya if I'm a citizen of malaysia
I mean
they of course everyone should be proud of their own country but looking at your own ministers acting like that in the parliament
is a joke you know is a joke you know <malay>kau kau tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>kita punya</malay> (uh) how how well
[ah] our ministers in singapore is acting and how (uh) well-spoken are they in the parliament itself the way they project their views and points on how to improve the singaporeans lives are very (uh)
I would say [ah] I don't know what to say [ah] it's very good [lah] I would say what you think about that
actually actually <malay>memang ada tapi</malay> (err)
(uh) he he's called the <malay>yang berhormat</malay> speaker you know he's the man in the centre that (uh) will call on each (uh) each minister to speak up speak on his opinions and points for his respective
(uh) ministry like for example financial or et cetera [lah] and but then
I really (err) you know in <malay>melayu</malay> [ah] they say <malay>kesian</malay> [ah] with the speaker cause he always get shout get shouted at by the ministers
you know some of the ministers say [eh] speaker <malay>diam</malay> [lah] [eh] speaker <malay>apa ini</malay> you know they are very chaotic you know and
ya but then ya they are paid well man they are paid
I heard fifty thousands maybe more than that but ya their parliament is
I would say I'm sorry to say but it's kind of joke [lah] I mean have you watch the singapore [one]
in YouTube or something and I really fancy how mister #shanmugam# and mister what it's called [ah] mister #vivian balakrishnan# the way he speak at even at when you go to when you travel to foreign countries the way he speaks is
very I would say as singaporean I'll be very proud that a man of my country is travelling and speaking in such way
basic skill is it
bro (uh) I don't find it weird [ah] cause <malay>sebab apa</malay> [tau]
I read I mean ya again I read again on the news
all of the ministers actually <malay>ada</malay> fake degree you know he actually <malay>beli</malay>
<malay>di apa</malay> a fake degree on internet or something or <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>dia suruh orang</malay>
<malay>pergi ambil</malay> degree for him so that he can have the degree for himself to eventually apply for future jobs or something [lah] I mean <malay>memalukan</malay> [seh] <malay>kau</malay>
I mean <malay>kau dah tak</malay>
<malay>kau atau kau malas atau kau tak pandai lepas tu kau nak suruh orang buat</malay> [kan] <malay>sebab kau nak dapat kerja yang bagus</malay> and
you being a minister you will only (err) how to say (uh) not doing the job a citizen would expect them to do [lah] you know
recruitment
I mean probably those with (uh) in a higher position right they seem (uh) they see that this people are maybe kind of interesting join in joining the politics and ya maybe that person is just
a son of their own friends so they just take it [lah] so there's a conflict you know there's a conflict of interest there they it's not recruited based on merit you know and and I think in singapore most ministers I would say most [ah] I repeat again most ministers
are recruited (uh) based on merit [lah] you know though he they are they really speak well they really project their points and their opinions well on how to improve the life of singaporean and ya <malay>aku aku</malay> happy [ah] <malay>macam</malay> singapore <malay>ada</malay> government <malay>yang</malay> stable [ah] <malay>walaupun ye</malay> [lah] <malay>ramai kata apa</malay> [lah] <malay>ni</malay> minister <malay>ni tak bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>minister tu tak bagus tapi</malay>
<malay>aku rasa</malay> <malay>kita nya</malay> government quite stable [lah] and <malay>aku</malay> happy to see that ya
[eh] actually <malay>aku terima soalan ni banyak gila</malay> [ah] <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku fikir aku nak duduk</malay> malaysia the reason being is that
[ah] the peace and financial freedom <malay>mungkin sebab masa tu</malay> I mean still (uh) <malay>sampai sekarang</malay> [lah] <malay>aku masih kerja kat</malay> singapore [kan] and I'm earning singapore dollars
and when the money is converted (uh) into the malaysian currency it's time <malay>apa</malay> times three <malay>apa</malay> so <malay>satu dolar tiga ringgit</malay> and you when you go there <malay>kau boleh</malay> spend <malay>apa-apa kau beli makanan ni baju ni pergi apa</malay> spa <malay>apa bagai</malay> and <malay>kau boleh buat apa-apa</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi kau fikir balik kalau kau duduk sana</malay>
and <malay>kau kerja kat sana</malay> [eh] you might not be (uh) spending lavishly or you know living happily cause you are earning malaysia <malay>ringgit</malay> example you are earning two thousand <malay>ringgit</malay> in malaysia
I mean I don't know can you be happy with that
!huh! so you willing to wake up in the
you know early morning four and know people are still sleeping and <malay>kau baru bangun dah kena siap apa naik</malay> bus <malay>atau naik</malay> motor <malay>pergi kerja sini</malay> and okay [lah] <malay>mungkin kalau kau masih muda dalam</malay> twenty plus thirty plus it might be healthy for you to travel here and there from singapore to malaysia
<malay>sebab</malay> ya the you know the okay example <malay>kau bangun pukul empat pagi</malay> then <malay>kau kerja sampai lima pagi</malay> and you have to go through the jam probably can take you for two three hours and <malay>kau balik sampai rumah lapan malam</malay>
and you know <malay>kau</malay> barely have time for yourself [ah] you know <malay>kau rasa kau akan</malay> do that for a long term or
(um)
(uh) maybe you wanna maybe you want to try to live there with having
you know try to spend two thousand <malay>ringgit</malay> in a month there you know you wanna try living there two thousand <malay>ringgit</malay> I mean
of course [ah] it's not easy for them I mean <malay>aku pun ada sedara kat</malay> malaysia and they are actually
struggling actually live in [ah] you know <malay>dalam kampung-kampung semua</malay> and (um) <malay>kalau kat</malay> singapore <malay>apa orang kata</malay> is it or gross income [lah] <malay>dalam dalam satu rumah tu mungkin dalam seribu ringgit</malay>
<malay>atau seribu lima ratus ringgit</malay> and
it's still <malay>tak cukup</malay> you know cause they are living in a <malay>dalam rumah dah ada lima orang enam orang</malay> I mean <malay>mungkin barang-barang murah tapi</malay>
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>barang-barang lain macam</malay> bill <malay>makanan apa semua</malay> [lah] <malay>macam-macam</malay> and still <malay>tak cukup untuk dorang</malay> so we cannot really compare ourselves to them I mean everyone have their own struggles [ah] so we cannot justify on what they are facing [ah] but [kan] in singapore itself it's very hard you know
(err) like I said [lah] having two thousand is barely enough for yourself and ya what else if you have to have a family
(uh) ya I mean I do agree [lah] on what you are what you just speak you know but (uh)
do you notice that we've been speaking so seriously for the past (uh) thirty minutes and actually I you know I wanted to ask if actually do you have a girlfriend right now
(err) no I I don't
I mean I might sound
(err) like an ancient man but I don't really believe in relationships [lah]
ya I mean okay in terms of religion in islam relationship before marriage is <malay>haram</malay>
and I think
in the current generation right relationship is just so
I don't know I find it wrong [ah]
have have you even notice that you know this person A and B
break up on january
and the next month they have already another person by their side and how is he how how is it so easy for them to find another person so fast and
what is love for them you know what you think about that
ya like like what you said [lah] I mean it's not the right time to have a relationship cause
I think it's very important you know to have more money to be stable I mean I think in singapore [lah] you know <malay>penting gila</malay> I I mean it's very important to be financially stable
I mean what's the point of you having a partner and you are struggling and you are expecting your partner to help you you know to <malay>tolong</malay> you to to (uh) you know to give <malay>duit</malay> I mean
it's embarrassing [ah] I mean this is not some gender inequality [lah] but then as a guy I don't think it's right for you to ask for money from your girl you know
ya I mean I hope that your point is not implementing that women are weak you know I mean if you see nowadays women are actually women are earning more than men actually
but it's just that (um) ya actually women [ah] do earn more than men nowadays but I don't think they are
emotionally stable so that is why we as a man
(uh) have to lead them [lah] I mean I mean this topic is very (err) subjective [lah] you know but I think in singapore women are really (um) having a good career earning more than man I would say
and ya that that's why we the relationship in singapore is very complex and that explains [ah] birth rate in singapore is declining [kan] <malay>orang takut sangat nak ada anak sebab</malay>
ya <malay>dorang risau</malay> [kan] <malay>apa tak</malay> (uh) <malay>tak ada tak cukup duit</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ada</malay> time and
<malay>aku tak faham</malay> [ah] <malay>kenapa entah aku kalau ada anak aku tak akan tak akan ada</malay> maid <malay>aku tak akan ambil</malay> maid <malay>untuk jaga anak aku sebab</malay>

cause like I went cause remember I told you last week the korean <malay>punya</malay> stall aunty <malay>dia kata</malay>
[oh] if by next week it's not
open yet that means it's closed forever so I checked monday first thing in the morning I checked it's closed so
!aduh!
I don't know what to do [eh] #mala# and me are like
halal
halal
okay then what was stopping you thought
[a'ah]
[oh] <malay>aku dapat apa</malay> <malay>ada</malay> #mala# and I saw like my malay friend <malay>apa apa nama dia</malay> (uh) #izzah# from #izzah# is from band remember #izzah# my
<malay>yang tu</malay> ya ya ya
and she was eating #mala# so
and she's quite one of those like religious kind of girl so it should be like halal [kan]
I don't know I was thinking of texting #rusydi# like
to either #dabao# or like see if she can like register us in that time we said I'm willing
to go the extra mile
to be registered in but ya
I did I didn't and I was like everyday I eat #mala# I was like
pray I was like to #allah# to count my blessings <malay>semua</malay>
you took it for granted [ah] that's why it's gone now it's your fault it's literally your fault
no I have you eaten there before <malay>kau pernah makan</malay>
[ah]
[oh] ya the <malay>daging mahal</malay> ya
you usually eat the chinese sausage it's
it is
[oh] ya ya I did take that
that time <malay>aku makan dengan</malay> #arlef# (uh) <malay>makan</malay> #mala# <malay>dekat</malay> I think it was last year
we got the like the duck
the duck <malay>rasa lemak dia sedap</malay>
ya it like flavours the whole dish
ya
ya
Ichikokudo #ramen# [a'ah]
your <malay>bapa</malay> never let you go <malay>makan</malay>
as a family you mean like family dinner [ah]
ya so I think to me #ramen# is not my
<malay>macam</malay> not my type of food do you agree
no like no the one <malay>yang</malay> at Ichikokudo
[oh] you like you like yours [ah]
no I didn't
to me <malay>rasa dia terlampau rasa dia terlampau lemak</malay> because <malay>aku makan dia punya</malay>
(uh) garlic #ramen# I felt like
the fact that it's garlic <malay>dia dah</malay> cut
the richness of the flavor [tau]
but it was super like <malay>lemak</malay> for some reason and cause I didn't take spice I didn't put the spice also why didn't you going as far as I didn't like wanted to be
I didn't like want it to be spicy
ya
ya stomach <malay>aku ada</malay> problem bro <malay>aku tak boleh makan</malay> spicy food period
ya
<malay>tapi</malay> I that time I [eh] you know [oh] my god I forgot to tell you about this
I bought Samyang light
ya
ya
(uh)
no because when you add less of the sauce <malay>dia punya</malay> flavor
it's lesser
it's
ya you can barely taste it
do you do you get where I'm like coming from
the ya the the the gravy
to me <malay>untuk aku</malay> because Samyang [kan] (uh) the normal noodles <malay>dia punya</malay> calories about five hundred
but this [one] the calories is lesser so I feel like I'm
<malay>kurus sekarang</malay>
it's literally about three hundred seventy calories
and the but the noodles are slightly thinner but it's the same texture the sauce is like less spicy
no but it doesn't affect much [ah] to me
<malay>abeh dia punya</malay>
but the taste to me the sweetness is a bit a bit stronger
<malay>sebab</malay> you know like you put it like there's less ties to numb your tongue
[oh] (uh)
your ability to taste is there but it's still very spicy to me I was literally still dying
ya
to me <malay>dia nya</malay> carbonara <malay>dia nya rasa terlampau</malay>
almost <malay>bukan</malay>
Samyang
<malay>dia nya rasa</malay> almost <malay>bukan</malay> Samyang and babe <malay>abeh dia punya</malay> noodles also not <malay>macam</malay>
something that <malay>aku</malay> eat
<malay>aku tak makan</malay> that kind of stuff
<malay>kau makan dia punya</malay> cup <malay>atau dia punya</malay>
no cup <malay>atau</malay> the packet
[oh] <malay>aku</malay> prefer <malay>aku</malay> think there's a like a
[ah]
the packet [one] not the cup
the cup [one] I feel like it doesn't like <malay>kau</malay> try <malay>makan</malay> Samyang cup <malay>biasa</malay> not even carbonara the texture <malay>semua lain</malay> [what]
<malay>kenyal kenyal</malay>
[oh] okay
<malay>kenyal kenyal</malay>
no <malay>kenyal</malay> is like (err) <malay>perkataan yang betul</malay>
serious
[ah]
<malay>kenapa</malay>
[oh] you <malay>kau tengah</malay> looking through universities [eh]
#paolo# <malay>kat</malay> yes correct
(oo) <malay>aku</malay> (uh) <malay>dia punya</malay> course is (uh) sciences <malay>sosial</malay>
ya
(um)
<malay>kejap</malay> [eh]
(mm) bachelor of
[oh] <malay>dorang ada</malay> human resource <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>tapi aku aku tidak</malay>
<malay>begitu</malay>
passionate <malay>tentang</malay> human resource
to be honest ya to be honest
okay <malay>aku</malay> I I know <malay>akan</malay>
sound a bit <malay>dunia</malay>
I don't know <malay>tapi sebab</malay>
<malay>macam aku</malay> really <malay>nak</malay> try <malay>pergi</malay> overseas [ah]
<malay>aku</malay> just thinking because it might it's not really plausible for me to go overseas because of finances
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> a real thing is it will take two years only if I go overseas
instead of three years I'm <malay>aku</malay> looking at western australia <malay>nya</malay> uni [kan] <malay>kat</malay> perth
<malay>abeh dia punya</malay> fees about thirty eight thousand
<malay>tiga puluh lapan ribu</malay> (uh) per <malay>tahun</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay>
if <malay>aku punya</malay> is eligible <malay>untuk</malay> scholarship
(err)
okay so then I would I can get ten thousand off a year ya so it'll be twenty eight thousand and I'll only be there for two years so it's about fifty six thousand
<malay>abeh</malay> accommodation I can stay with my uncle <malay>tapi dia punya orang</malay> was like <malay>betul ke kau nak tinggal dengan</malay> uncle <malay>kau</malay>
no like I I called the overseas education it's like a
they liaise with the university for us
ya I called ya
ya <malay>abeh</malay> when she was talking to me <malay>dia kata</malay> are you sure you really wanna stay with your aunty because I mean it's not really a good idea [kan] <malay>untuk tinggal dengan kau punya sepupu semua</malay>
[kan] ya ya ya
that's why I was just thinking then she said accommodation about (uh) eighteen thousand to twenty thousand a year
so <malay>aku fikir</malay> forty thousand extra that's
ninety plus already besides cost of school
true <malay>sebab aku punya</malay> uncle <malay>dengan aku punya</malay> aunty <malay>dorang punya rumah</malay> is
quite near to university [tau] like <malay>macam</malay> actually <malay>dekat</malay>
<malay>abeh dorang ada banyak bilik</malay> spare cause <malay>dorang nya anak semua dah besar dah kahwin</malay>
ya like for real ya
right
<malay>tapi kalau gitu</malay> I have to take a gap year <malay>untuk kerja dapat duit</malay>
ya
ya <malay>abeh kerja kat mana</malay>
(oo) period
period
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> start [eh]
bro
<malay>dah</malay>
<malay>dah kat dunia dah dah kat space</malay>
[a'ah] <malay>betul</malay>
ya attachment issues
#elisa#
[a'ah]
<malay>dah besar</malay> [lah]
(mmhmm)
<malay>mak dia nak ikut dia pergi</malay> overseas
okay
[oh] <malay>mak dia</malay> attached to her [eh]
<malay>kesiannya</malay>
no but <malay>sebab dia dia</malay> youngest in the family [what] so I think it's like expected [ah]
<malay>tapi mak dia</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> what I thought you said she's like financially like
<malay>tapi</malay> her mum let [lah] is it taking a loan
super smart okay
how her is like almost like it is like three point eight kinda vibes
no but if she has a four point O it will be known [tau] because usually that is like honour roll
people get four point O in their courses usually like
like is broadcasted to the whole cohort
like during the process do people like the does the teacher like favour her
[oh]
daphne also four point O
what
daphne is the one <malay>yang</malay>
[oh] ya ya of course [lah]
[oh] <malay>tapi</malay> when <malay>kau tengah keluar dengan kawan kau</malay> do you guys talk about <malay>pelajaran atau</malay> completely like no
[oh] so your yours are just casual friends [ah] like <malay>bukan</malay> competitive
vibe
(mmhmm)
[oh] <malay>korang macam</malay> united [ah]
[oh] okay
ya
make enemies with a snap of a finger
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay> #elisa# <malay>dia nak pergi</malay> university <malay>mana satu</malay>
[oh]
<malay>dorang ada</malay> plan
[oh]
down to the T I guess
ya
(mm)
[oh]
[a'ah] yes
ya
<malay>tapi</malay> #elisa# <malay>mak dia bagi tak kalau dia nak</malay>
<malay>menyambungkan pelajarannya di luar negeri</malay>
okay okay okay I mean everyone has that like dream that they want to go overseas right
<malay>kerja sana</malay> [kan]
<malay>kau tahu tak</malay> the main <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> that people <malay>nak pergi negeri lain</malay> [kan] is because <malay>dorang nak</malay> migrate [tau]
like for example [kan] <malay>aku pergi</malay> (uh) perth for university there most likely I would want to settle down there also
that kind of like no as in like if people go <malay>macam</malay> for
like (uh) someone from singapore <malay>dorang nak</malay> (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>belajar kat</malay> america boston university
like why would they want to come back because their university degree cert is mostly applicable there [what]
so it's like it's meant to like <malay>macam</malay>
facilitate <malay>dorang untuk keluar negeri kita</malay>
ya
so <malay>macam</malay> like the thing about <malay>ambil</malay>
loan right is a very risky
I saw this (uh) tweet <malay>pasal</malay> this guy they took a hundred thousand loan <malay>tak salah aku</malay> hundred thousand <malay>ke</malay> hundred fifty thousand <malay>untuk</malay> (uh) go to <malay>apa</malay> university <malay>di</malay> america
I don't I don't think singaporean I think it was from china I I can't remember [ah] I honestly can't remember
<malay>abeh lepas tu</malay> he he they took a very big loan right but he got a job starting salary <malay>tujuh ribu</malay>
ya so within like five year he can pay it off
so it's like <malay>macam</malay> the starting pay is a lot [what] seven thousand is a lot [eh]
ya I mean if I feel like in <malay>negeri</malay> america
<malay>dorang nya</malay> starting pay quite high [seh]
[oh] ya they have minimum wage ya that's right that's right
singapore like university degrees I think like three thousand like I find that quite like
low [ah] to be honest
which one
that's all [ah] he can pay it off in five years it's like a it's like a return on investment kind of vibe [ah]
<malay>untuk</malay> [ah] <malay>aku punya</malay> perspective
no <malay>bukan</malay> hope it's more of worry <malay>macam</malay> if <malay>aku pergi</malay> overseas education what if <malay>aku tak boleh bayar balik</malay>
right ten year <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
but ya
but it's still a bit risky [ah] like what if I can't find a job
[kan]
ya but I mean I'm just putting it out there into the universe about the overseas thing
cause I'll obviously try my best to go into a local [lah]
like no matter what
(mmhmm) <malay>abeh</malay> ya
it's quite scary [ah] to be honest
go overseas and everything
ya
not really I didn't make much memories that's why I want to make sure <malay>aku punya</malay> university <malay>aku</malay> make as much memories as possible
<malay>kalau boleh aku nak</malay> give it another run [lah]
(um)
not choose my class <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] time <malay>aku masuk</malay> poly I actually chose to be in O two
like my class is number two like there's five classes so O one O two O three O four
ya
and that time #dina# was my only friend <malay>kawan aku satu</malay> [jer]
so <malay>aku was like</malay> okay let me just be in the same class as #dina# but if I were to redo it again I would appeal into the same course I don't know
but I would not choose a class
[kan] what course right
I think <malay>kalau boleh</malay> aerospace [sia]
ya because you did you know that I have a passion for planes right
foundation no because they will reteach A math A math is in year one again
of polytechnic ya
ya
but ya so about local university <malay>kau nak pergi mana satu</malay> and like

[oh] ya
ya period
[oh] <malay>tentang</malay> addison rae
<malay>aku</malay> just I think I'm <malay>aku</malay> just
inspired by addison rae
<malay>dia seorang</malay> businesswoman <malay>yang sangat gigih</malay>
she does so much like work
<malay>dia jumpa</malay> kourtney kardashian
<malay>aku rasa</malay> [kan] <malay>dia yang paling banyak</malay> (um)
drive ya
and personality
<malay>dia punya dia seorang yang sangat gembira</malay> all the time
do you agree
[oh]
[oh]
[oh] ya
no no the thing the thing <malay>yang aku sedikit marah</malay>
[eh] <malay>marah</malay>
the TikTokers in general
<malay>kau</malay> do you know #avani#
do you notice how
<malay>dia sangat bosan</malay>
as a person
super
<malay>kau pernah nampak</malay> videos <malay>dia tak</malay>
no no no <malay>kau pernah nampak video dia tak</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> james charles [eh]
no <malay>aku rasa</malay> the only reason I mean I know you say <malay>jangan tengok</malay> video <malay>dia kalau tak suka</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi</malay> the only the thing is I don't think <malay>dia</malay> deserve all this fame
no she is
she is like serious she has like millions
I know #avani# is not as famous as the rest
<malay>dia punya</malay> ya
<malay>aku tengok dia</malay> collab <malay>dengan</malay> james charles [tau] <malay>di</malay> YouTube
and when they were talking she was completely <malay>sangat bosan</malay> as a person like I literally <malay>macam</malay> couldn't
even james I feel like james couldn't even like hold conversations with her
like as a person she doesn't have that personality that
is linked to a influencer
ya she's just like any other introvert
who just got this fame and then she doesn't know how to talk like at least with all these you should learn how to talk right
but you don't
ya <malay>abeh</malay> charli #d'amelio# <malay>pun aku rasa</malay> she don't deserve I mean she's a good dancer
she's a good dancer but does she deserve hundred million do you agree
<malay>ni</malay> something <malay>yang aku</malay> have been thinking about [ah] serious
ya nice but does nice deserve hundred million followers <malay>kau kata</malay> yes <malay>ke tak</malay>
ya because it it literally convert
okay
to be on a record like none of the TikTokers because it literally it's just fifteen second videos
it's just fifteen second videos I think
no <malay>aku rasa</malay> okay what makes me like a bit angry about charli #d'amelio# is <malay>dia punya</malay> latest video <malay>dengan</malay> maddie #ziegler#
the <malay>dorang buat</malay> makeup
<malay>dan</malay> the way she talk is so soft okay soft can be a good personality but it's like no substance and like no
ya but if you have this fame you should at least learn [lah] to
ya that <malay>itu apa apa aku fikir</malay> [lah] <malay>tentang situasi ini</malay>
ya
ya
but then again their net worth is like <malay>berapa</malay> million so <malay>aku</malay> have nothing on them
ya period bro nothing on them
ya
ya
do you think she's interesting
no when when we talk about influencers we don't talk about talking to them do you think they have a lot of personality because that's like the
a main selling point like james charles he's so interesting
no he has an it factor
that's what I'm trying to say
ya
he's
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay <malay>aku faham</malay>
<malay>cuma aku</malay> just (uh) <malay>aku baik dengan dorang aku aku</malay> think <malay>dorang sangat</malay>
(um) talented
<malay>dorang dah dalam bidang menari dan</malay> stuff like that
<malay>tapi</malay> I just don't think they deserve this much followers [lah]
based on how they talk like they cannot talk they can't host like <malay>macam</malay>
like legit it's legit just (uh)
circumstantial I feel like because of quarantine <malay>semua orang dalam</malay> (uh)
phone <malay>dorang</malay> so
and I think <malay>dorang punya</malay> it factor comes from not talking it's just the videos they make
ya so I don't think <malay>dorang</malay> deserve all these big opportunities you know
<malay>yang</malay> (uh) <malay>miniman yang baru</malay> [eh]
[oh] <malay>yang</malay> trend <malay>baru</malay> [eh]
no I don't <malay>aku tak minum</malay> Starbucks [ah] bro
period
[oh] <malay>kau dapat</malay> anxiety <malay>macam mana</malay>
going out and drinking coffee
[oh] ya <malay>malam tu</malay> [eh]
fidgety [a'ah]
to naturalise to (uh)
ya
<malay>kau</malay> that time <malay>yang aku minum kopi aku nak</malay> pass out <malay>kau ingat</malay>
ya no is <malay>yang</malay> I drank the whole cold brew remember
I don't drink coffee I'm already cannot drink
remember
<malay>yang kita minum</malay> [tau] it's like that coffee drink
ya we studied at #ngee ann#
Coffee Bean
that night <malay>yang aku nak</malay> pass out <malay>sebab aku</malay> exercise after that
ya <malay>aku nya</malay> heart was already like dying <malay>aku</malay> literally was like
I don't know it was so bad like
it's like having an anxiety attack but like #intenser#
<malay>abeh</malay> I thought running would help it but running makes your heart rate high but then it like <malay>macam</malay> complicates things <malay>aku</malay> literally was like about to pass out
after that
like for thirty minutes later ya I I literally like I don't know it was so bad

I have like five projects to do
(uh) no [ah] like in week six now is only week two

[eh] <malay>aku dah boleh</malay> book <malay>aku nya</malay> test [tau]
<malay>belum sebab dia nya</malay> date <malay>tak</malay> suitable
have you done your simulator
you should do it ASAP [tau]
(uh) the simulator <malay>bukan ikut</malay> stage doesn't care doesn't matter
you just go to <malay>kau punya</malay> new bookings
<malay>lepas tu kau tekan</malay> simulator there's three that you have to go through
twenty five dollars each <malay>tak salah</malay>
ya it's it's basically just to get your money [lah]
it's so useless even if you pass fail it doesn't matter you just have to go through the simulator
then it will be easy
then you should do final theory ASAP also
<malay>sebab kalau tak</malay> like I like I don't want you to clash with school
final theory is more to me final theory is harder than
(uh) <malay>dia nya</malay> first <malay>yang</malay> basic <malay>dengan</malay>
theory
no it's different content also you memorise a whole different set
I think I took like two hours memorising everything

okay not to flex <malay>tapi aku aku masuk</malay>
(uh) <malay>aku masuk bilik aku masuk lambat</malay> [kan] <malay>dia nya</malay> final theory room

<malay>apa</malay>
[oh] student do not required to book simulator lessons for this course means <malay>kau</malay> manual <malay>tak yah naik tak yah itu ke</malay>

#booboo# and molly
(uh) molly (um)
#booboo# cheated on me with my brother
she was literally on his lap sleeping then I'm like [oh] my god #booboo# you're so fake
ya because molly molly is like that molly is exclusive [tau]
molly only loves my brother no one else
he only #manjas# me when he need something <malay>macam nak makan gitu baru</malay> he come to me
<malay>tapi kalau tak</malay> he ignore me he got attitude [one]
<malay>tapi semalam</malay> molly <malay>macam manja dengan aku sikit</malay> so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay

ya I didn't have time to read them
I was out with my friend
ya I went home like late
thank you for the pity
but <malay>aku</malay> just feel like #safirah# do you think #safirah# overreact <malay>atau</malay> like she react accordingly
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak suka</malay> #rafi# [ah]
and I'm right right
do you think my intuition is right
about people
no <malay>macam</malay> when I first <malay>nampak</malay> #rafi# I knew I I wasn't gonna like him
but most of the time <malay>aku punya</malay> intuition is right though whenever I have a bad feeling about someone it always happens
#dina#
ya my intuition is always right
no as in she's always sus she's always sus
wait what other things <malay>aku</malay> I remember like getting a lot of things right <malay>macam</malay> regarding all these sus things
ya
but <malay>aku</malay> feel like <malay>aku</malay> reacted accordingly though like
that's why I don't feel like super bad because <malay>aku rasa</malay> just #safirah# is like overreacting
not like in a bad way but like it's just #rafi# like
ya I do because I didn't wanna hurt her but
I just don't like #rafi#
which is right
ya <malay>tak</malay> no <malay>kejap aku nak</malay> explain <malay>dengar aku dulu</malay>
okay so basically <malay>yang pasal tu yang kita keluar dengan</malay> #xu shi# <malay>aku</malay> #xu shi# <malay>dengan</malay> #safirah# <malay>makan</malay>
fish and chips by the way

<malay>abeh lepas tu</malay>
#safirah# [kan] <malay>masuk</malay> Instagram <malay>dia</malay> then I was like I told #safirah# I'm super angry
<malay>aku macam nak</malay> message <malay>dia gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> just to
say everything [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like why you do this to #safirah# and all <malay>abeh</malay> #safirah# was like no
but then she was like [oh] but you know what you know what I actually mean right
ya
so I got I got what she's trying to say but this thing that happened yesterday what I messaged #rafi# in private
is a separate issue
ya it is impulse it's a separate thing it's not like
what I'm gonna do you know
ya
cause she <malay>dia tak</malay> reply <malay>aku</malay> [tau] do you <malay>dia</malay> reply <malay>kau</malay>
<malay>abeh apa perasaan kau</malay> when <malay>dia</malay> reply
<malay>apa perassan kau</malay> when #safirah# replied

I don't know I don't know
I don't know
I don't know I just feel incredibly guilty eating doughnuts
no like the calories is quite high
per doughnut like it's been like ya
<malay>aku</malay> that time the last time <malay>aku makan</malay> doughnuts is the Swee Heng <malay>aku suka yang</malay> that kind of doughnuts
like the one dollar fifty cent doughnut
<malay>yang sedap yang besar abeh ada</malay> chocolate rice <malay>kat atas</malay> so <malay>sedap</malay>

[oh]
[oh] <malay>kau suka</malay> complicated flavours [ah] <malay>kira</malay> [kan]
period bro
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>rasa</malay>
<malay>sedikit sedih</malay> [ah] <malay>tentang</malay> this situation
because
I think [kan] what
#safirah# needs I told I told my mum about <malay>situasi</malay> #safirah# [tau] about the entire break up
<malay>abeh aku macam aku</malay> I know #safirah# <malay>dia terlampau</malay> serious <malay>untuk</malay> relationship
<malay>kahwin</malay> which is good
is <malay>bukan perkara yang jahat</malay> [tau] <malay>untuk buat gini</malay>
<malay>tapi aku rasa dia terlampau</malay> serious when the guys are literally like
seventeen years old
<malay>mana macam</malay> it's <malay>macam tak</malay> add up <malay>gitu</malay>
like <malay>dia nak</malay> settle down <malay>sekarang</malay> which is so unrealistic at this modern day and age
ya
like when <malay>dia</malay> message <malay>dia kata</malay> [oh] <malay>kenapa semua orang</malay> <malay>atau semua orang masih sekolah</malay>
then like what are you expecting you know what I mean
she's nineteen [lah] I mean like <malay>kalau nak kahwin</malay> at least twenty three <malay>baru</malay> find a real like a serious [one] [lah]
I feel like it's a bit <malay>macam terlampau cepat</malay>
and it's like she shouldn't be finding for a boyfriend right now (uh) like in all honesty
my mum my mum said <malay>macam</malay> you shouldn't like you gonna break your heart
like she's gone through two you know how like heartbreaking it is like I cannot even fathom
you know what I mean like it's so tiring to like go into this cycle <malay>macam kau percaya orang ni</malay>
<malay>abeh</malay> last last <malay>dia pecah</malay> [kan] <malay>hati kau macam gitu</malay> [jer]
ya it's so unfair for her [ah]
ya <malay>tapi aku</malay> just feel bad [ah]
be loved
no
ya
ya
then <malay>macam</malay> do you know about #safirah# <malay>punya</malay> parents
like how like
no like the the marriage vibes
[oh] then (uh) it's okay
no but because like I was also telling my mum like <malay>macam</malay> my mum said if you come from a stable family
like most likely you won't be out there <malay>macam</malay> looking for like
love
elsewhere you know like you will get it sufficiently from your home that kind of
no <malay>macam</malay> like falling like for the first guy you talked to that kind of vibe
ya
that was (uh) <malay>itu yang terjadi kepada</malay> #irfan# <malay>apa</malay> the first time also
it's just sad for her
<malay>dia punya dorang nya</malay> family messed up [kan] #irfan# <malay>nya</malay>
[oh] ya ya he's like born into that vibe
ya not too psychotic
or manipulative or toxic
ya [eh] <malay>ni ni</malay> skirt <malay>yang kau pakai</malay> that day [eh] <malay>yang</malay> plaid <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>dah cuci</malay>
[oh] you wash yourself [kan]
but your own batch
<malay>abeh kau lipat sendiri</malay>
!wah!
we would put it in like one bus
<malay>buat</malay> [kan]
<malay>sebab dah besar</malay> [kan]
<malay>nenek</malay>
<malay>moyang apa</malay> [ah]
damn you saw your <malay>moyang</malay>
she was alive until
sec two sec three sec two or sec three
she was she was the sitters she used to take care of my children all the time when she was about
mini relationship is not that right
a movie so I think that's why my mum is like so desperate [leh]
I have like a good relationship with you

okay (uh) <malay>kau nak</malay> start
okay (uh) my name is
iman salihin also from singapore poly
year two also doing (uh) marine engineering
so
first we are going to talk about
ya
okay
(err) okay first
<malay>aku</malay> join poly through which is the polytechnic foundation programme so from N levels supposed <malay>aku gi</malay>
(uh) higher NITEC but then I found out that (uh)
I got a chance to go [ah] because my
three was
just nice eleven
so I join singapore poly (err) through marine engineering as my first choice
so I can say
<malay>ada ada minat</malay> [ah] so <malay>aku tak ada</malay> problem
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay>
like why why are you not (uh) interested
(mm)
(uh)
what else
okay (uh) so
both of us are in year two now
so far
doing okay [lah]
ya
for me is (uh)
<malay>aku tengah</malay> doing #muay thai#
(uh)
actually from
from till now I just keep changing
<malay>dari silat</malay> then go squash
apparently now is #muay thai#
which I find (uh) more interesting than the others [ah] in terms of
(err) social connection and all that
<malay>abeh kau</malay>
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> is just
it's not my thing [ah] <malay>dikir barat</malay>
cause I'm performance wise is not my interest because (uh)
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay> stage fright
then maybe because of that <malay>abeh dikir barat</malay> as I see is quite interesting [ah] like to watch not to do it yourself you get ya so
I guess now #muay thai# is going well so far
(uh) training quite intense so ya
[oh]
<malay>tapi</malay>
that's the difference [ah] <malay>aku sebab</malay>
(err) that is <malay>macam</malay>
competition (uh)
not not a performance kind of competition [lah]
<malay>macam tu aku</malay> fight is ya ya ya
ya because from secondary school so I mean wait from primary school <malay>aku</malay>
(uh) <malay>sepak takraw</malay> [pe] so
that that competition <malay>macam orang tengok</malay> is normal
but performance is
like never my thing
so that's why ya
(mmhmm)
okay secondary school life okay actually because (err)
<malay>aku</malay> since young (uh) <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
not really sociable [lah] <malay>aku</malay> is a introvert ya
so
since primary school [lah] <malay>aku</malay> introvert so
but primary school [lah] <malay>aku</malay> still had this <malay>macam</malay> close friends so <malay>aku</malay> still okay secondary school also I had close friends but
it was less
play time for me I guess
because I just went through the four years like
just being low key and all that
still join <malay>takraw</malay> which is good and made a lot of friends there
but overall I think my secondary school life was just
studying and just got through it [ah] and I go through it ya you go
(mm)
[ah]
so
is naughty [eh]
(uh)
okay that's the tough part <malay>sebab aku</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> didn't really got problem thus <malay>aku</malay> student counsellor so so <malay>aku tak boleh macam</malay> mess up [lah] so basically but the student council part also <malay>aku</malay> it wasn't
my choice [ah] because (err) sec one sec two I had the same form teachers
and then (err) <malay>dorang kira</malay> [kan]
<malay>sebab aku</malay> really from a
secondary school that is known to be
(uh) for like naughty kids [ah] and but is because is near my house so I take it as my first choice but ya
sec one sec two
<malay>aku</malay> considered mature for the age so my my teachers like nominate me to be student counsellor [lah] in sec two ya
<malay>aku</malay> actually <malay>tak nak sebab aku</malay> just just <malay>malas</malay> [ah] then so (uh) the funny thing is
<malay>aku</malay> didn't even go for the interview even though I had to [lah]
I just
that day I didn't feel like it so so I didn't go
and then I think a week after that the (uh) the the teacher in teacher in charge of the student counsellor
<malay>dorang dorang naik dekat</malay> (uh) assembly hall <malay>panggil aku dorang tanya</malay> (err)
why you never go for the interview and all that
okay <malay>aku cakap</malay> [ah] I don't want to be student council then he say okay okay and like a week after that they like one of the student counsellors came up they say [oh] you got duty today then I'm like what
he's like [oh] ya ya you're a student counsellor [what] ya ya so I
wasn't expected [ah] but then I was just like
okay [lah] never mind I just I just take the role [lah] do whatever I can
but ya so I didn't really have
like like (err)
naughty stuff that I did at least
[ah]
I think okay okay wait back to the the question the
whatever naughty stuff I did I think the only
wrong thing that I did was
when I don't feel like
like going through school I just act like I sick
and then the and then the teachers would believe me ya <malay>nanti ada orang hantar aku</malay>
go to sick bay <malay>nanti aku cakap</malay> stomachache and all that
then then later my parents come to school
school then I could go home
ya
guilty <malay>tak sangat</malay> right ya then
other then that (uh) not much [ah]
but to be honest <malay>aku rasa dorang tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi dorang</malay> just <malay>macam</malay>
is just like I I have no problems with my studies all that so like
ya
ya
<malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] can just go just go
ya like I think right after N level [ah]
<malay>aku</malay> first job <malay>aku</malay> was (uh) burger king which <malay>aku</malay> finds
still retail the the best (uh) job that I did [lah] as experience because okay I started
(err) in twenty seventeen which is (err) N level twenty seventeen after N levels (uh)
I join (uh) because a lot of my classmates work there also
so <malay>aku</malay> just join and then they quickly like train me
so usually I do kitchen so I prepare the burgers cook the meat and all that
which is fun [lah] for me
I got to
like teach myself how to handle pressure
and be independent [ah] because usually
(err) we have a lack of crew and then I have to handle the whole kitchen myself
which is still okay cause I was trained well so
ya
then what about you
(mm)
[oh]
a lot
(mm)
(mm)
these two at McDonald's
ya ya ya ya they are humble also [ah] and I think like
for malaysians also they one of the
more hardworking crew
yup and they travel so far and then you just to work F&B
ya
(mm)
so
after staff day <malay>takde lagi</malay>
(err) actually I got a few jobs after that so after burger king I tried
retail
so I I work at tommy hilfiger
it was
damn bad because ya because
can you imagine from burger king they're busy right then you are adapted to it
and then you have a lot of work and then
so when you have a lot of things to do
time goes on faster and then (err) so compared to retail
(err) in tommy hilfiger
it was it was
so long like I I work for eight hours a day
and then (uh) imagine like
one hour I think like only like three to five people come into the store and I don't even do much I just ask like (err) how how can I help you then they like [oh] no just browsing around and then they just leave their store and all that so
didn't have much to do other than folding clothes and ironing the clothes [ah] then so I quit after one month
but the thing was the pay was much better than burger king [lah]
but I I still prefer burger king
so but
I don't I think I went back to burger king I don't remember but also had a few other jobs
I work for McDonald's foodpanda
I also did (err)
photo booth (err)
kind of job
kind of [lah] because <malay>dorang macam</malay> (err) <malay>kira</malay> [kan]
(uh) business <malay>kecil</malay> so (uh)
<malay>macam</malay> referral [kan] so <malay>aku kerja</malay>
and then
the pay was quite good [ah] like three hours
I think <malay>aku dapat</malay> thirty forty
ya
ya
and then the job also was fun because
<malay>kau kerja</malay> is a different environment
so <malay>kadang-kadang aku kat orang kahwin kadang-kadang aku kat macam</malay> some [ah] [a'ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> just at some park or some event
which was fun [ah] I got experience a lot
(uh) ya
that's all for the job experience [ah]
ya honestly ya
ya
ya
think retail I counted like every minute [eh]
it was terrible but (uh)
<malay>jadi</malay>
[eh] <malay>apa dah kerja</malay>
<malay>sekolah</malay>
(err) I think part of
the job experience also is why we
for me I at least is why I chose this course engineering right at least is about <malay>sebab aku lagi</malay> prefer hands on
rather than <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) business and all that
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
yup
so next year <malay>kita dua gi</malay> internship
ya
yup
shore
you quite excited [ah] <malay>untuk</malay> shore
(mm)
(uh) <malay>aku</malay>
so <malay>aku gi belayar</malay> second sem
which is exciting [ah] <malay>untuk aku sebab aku pun</malay> join <malay>sebab dia punya</malay> sailing the part
so six months sailing
exciting <malay>tapi</malay>
scary <malay>juga sebab aku aku tak tahu macam</malay>
just one month of it how how can I cope [lah]
so
but
hopefully it'll be a
lifelong kind of (uh) career
for me
<malay>sebab aku pun</malay> planning (uh)
to reach chief engineer
and then after that when I come back to shore (err)
<malay>aku</malay> start family and all that so ya
exciting [ah]
<malay>aku rasa kau</malay>
even though internship <malay>kau dapat</malay> shore [kan]
[ah]
<malay>aku rasa</malay> there's still a chance <malay>untuk kau</malay> sail in the future you know <malay>macam kalau kau</malay> still carry on with this career then <malay>aku rasa</malay> why not <malay>kau ada dia punya</malay> diploma <malay>kau ada</malay> experience
so think is okay [lah]
<malay>takyah</malay> disappointed <malay>sangat</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> stuck at shore
yes <malay>sebab untuk aku</malay> (err)
<malay>aku</malay> rather sacrifice
<malay>aku punya</malay> time <malay>untuk</malay> (uh)
to have a stable living [ah] for my family
so ya
I think after all the the years
until I reach chief engineer until I can
retire the marine engineering job right then
it'll be more time spent with my family [lah]
because it's it's not just okay can you imagine <malay>macam</malay>
nine to five job [kan]
and then you come back you only have like saturday sunday as your
like your days with your family
[ah] exactly <malay>jadi untuk aku macam</malay> it's worth it [lah] <malay>kau</malay> go for six months
then got free for like like three months <malay>gitu</malay> three or more then
to be really you with your family [ah] and then it's it's not like your partner also has to
like work you know because you have a stable job already you can support them
so it's just really spend time with your family
(mmhmm)
yup
<malay>macam</malay> by the time <malay>aku</malay> reach <malay>macam tiga puluh empat puluh</malay> is
you can pull down [ah] ya you can come back to shore maybe (err) continue as lecturer I you relax [ah] ya
even workshop <malay>takpe</malay> [sia] fun so
<malay>aku suka</malay> [ah]
(mm)
okay
(mmhmm)
ya
(uh)
honestly following the trend [kan] <malay>aku rasa aku</malay>
we'll probably be posted to firefighting <malay>tapi</malay> personally <malay>aku nak</malay> army
ya <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku</malay> just
<malay>aku ada</malay> interest in the armed forces <malay>juga</malay>
<malay>kira</malay> the army navy <malay>ataupun</malay> air force [ah]
so (uh)
<malay>tapi</malay> firefighting <malay>pun untuk aku</malay> okay
<malay>tapi aku</malay> really <malay>tak nak</malay>
police
<malay>sebab macam bukan bukan wayang</malay>
(um) <malay>macam dari dari kecil</malay>
<malay>aku main bola bawah blok ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>atau aku gi</malay> skate <malay>ke apa nanti dorang datang</malay> screen <malay>abeh</malay>
(uh) it was a
ya and then since young <malay>aku</malay> had that (uh)
image of them <malay>macam dorang</malay> just
<malay>datang sini</malay> screen screen <malay>macam aku budak kecil kadang-kadang pun aku lepas sekolah</malay>
(err) <malay>aku pergi</malay> seven eleven <malay>beli</malay> maggi <malay>apa</malay> [kan] <malay>aku makan bawah blok tu pun dorang kadang-kadang datang dorang</malay> screen check check EZ-link <malay>semua aku</malay> don't find it
<malay>macam</malay> practical [lah] <malay>macam kau</malay> just <malay>kacau aku</malay> [kan] at this point [ah] so I never really had the interest for police
ya
I think the the the bad part was sometimes check bag <malay>aku</malay>
and it was like
[oh] what what yes
maybe <malay>dorang</malay> check <malay>rokok ke apa abeh aku</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> just found it like like weird [lah] to be honest like until now also I still feel
(uh)
that sense of (err)
I I take it personally [ah] sometimes but but I I try not to because sometimes also at <malay>nanti dorang tengok aku</malay>
[ah] [ah]
<malay>dorang tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>kadang-kadang dorang panggil</malay> and <malay>dorang</malay> check bag <malay>aku macam</malay> just
why [ah]
but ya that's why <malay>aku tak nak</malay> police
then <malay>kau</malay>
ya
frogmen
(mm)
<malay>sama</malay>
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay> air force
<malay>dorang pun ada lain punya</malay>
<malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh]
<malay>macam ada</malay> engineering <malay>punya</malay> part <malay>ada</malay> communications <malay>punya</malay> part
I because to be pilot also <malay>susah</malay>
so
<malay>kalau dorang</malay> offer <malay>kau untuk macam</malay> (uh) continue
posted to air force [eh] <malay>kau kau rasa kau ambil tak macam macam</malay>
how will you adapt
ya
ya
I think <malay>boleh</malay> [tau] <malay>sebab</malay> the thing is I went for the
I I
no no I tried to apply for the
sponsorship from air force
and then I went through the
forget what they call it but I went through the test
and it was a four hour sit down computerised test
(mm) so
ya there's a lot of different different types of test [ah]
[ah] <malay>ada dorang macam</malay> test <malay>kau punya</malay>
mathematics [lor] they call it arithmetics
so <malay>macam</malay>
(uh)
then other parts is the
the intelligence but either copy spatial awareness
okay the copy north south east west
and then you know you have to know when the
when when the plane is bank left
you have to know what what kind of
they give you shapes of the planes so what what does this described and honestly
it was okay for me because ya because
(err) at that point of time
(err) <malay>aku betul-betul nak</malay> so
months before that [kan] <malay>aku aku</malay> practice with this movie so <malay>aku aku tengok</malay> youtube video
<malay>aku</malay> take online test
unfortunately <malay>aku tak dapat</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang tak bilang</malay> score
pay is
but that's the air force [ah] I mean the armed forces you you won't know what
like what went wrong you know
just
(uh)
<malay>sebab dia ada aku rasa</malay> eight to ten different tests
so
(uh) <malay>ada yang aku rasa senang ada aku rasa susah</malay>
but
honestly overall <malay>aku rasa aku</malay> did not bad
ya so <malay>tapi tak kesah dapat tak dapat</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
then hopefully just continue marine engineering [lah]
okay obviously <malay>kalau ada</malay>
the different opportunities
<malay>aku aku</malay> definitely would
ya consider
honestly <malay>kalau</malay>
if I get the chance to be posted to air force then in the future
then I think I would continue as a career yup (uh) I I don't mind any (uh) what you call that like areas [ah]
the job areas like engineering <malay>atau</malay> (uh) communications
<malay>kalau</malay> pilot [lah] who don't mind
(mm)
ya
ya
<malay>sebab dia punya</malay> cockpit <malay>dia ada dia punya</malay> [ah]
so
ya
<malay>aku tengok macam</malay> national days <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti ada dia punya</malay> jet like cool [lah] <malay>untuk aku</malay>
but ya
what else
(mm)
what about copy [ah]
primary school life
spent there six years [eh] primary school
<malay>sama sama sama</malay> six years
which are compared to our different stages [lah]
so <malay>macam aku untuk aku</malay> primary school is when you develop your own (uh) character
ya
ya
<malay>sebab tu aku rasa untuk aku</malay> primary <malay>macam</malay> the most important
ya
(mm) yes
ya
ya
ya
ya ya
ya
that time parkour was like trending [ah]
[ah] the jump style
but ya primary school <malay>aku</malay> is (uh)
I think to through <malay>sepak takraw</malay> also
<malay>aku</malay>
(err) develop <malay>aku punya</malay> own personality
it's about (err) other than that
is <malay>aku</malay>
I'm a quite <malay>macam</malay> quiet person
<malay>jadi aku dalam</malay> class <malay>pun aku macam diam aku dengar macam apa cikgu tengah berbual</malay>
(err) <malay>tapi bila aku</malay> join <malay>takraw baru aku macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>jumpa orang-orang ni semua</malay> and
I was quite good at it [ah] <malay>sebab abang-abang aku pun dari takraw</malay>
and then the coach was the one that <malay>macam kira</malay> recruit <malay>aku</malay>
through my brothers [ah] <malay>dia dia nampak aku dia cakap</malay> [eh] join [ah] join [ah] <malay>takraw</malay>
then then (uh) <malay>aku</malay> join and then
I think by primary three I was selected to play for the school
and then (err) it was funny [ah] <malay>sebab aku</malay> was
I was quite small in terms of size
(err) whenever my
my coach like sub me
then the
I remember one time the the the ref
was talking to my coach then he said [oh] you you sub the big one with the small one [ah]
but I I didn't mind [lah] because I know my potential and then from there (uh)
coach <malay>aku pun macam</malay> confident <malay>aku boleh main</malay>
so
by primary
I think by primary four <malay>aku</malay> managed to be captain of junior team
ya so at primary four <malay>aku</malay> the captain at junior team and then primary five <malay>aku</malay> captain of senior team
ya so
ya ya that's why <malay>dari situ aku macam belajar macam</malay> this leadership roles
<malay>macam macam mana nak</malay> (uh)
motivate around ya discipline and all that ya
think my teachers in charge also
played a very
big part in who I am today
<malay>sebab dorang macam dorang jaga aku</malay> [ah] <malay>kat sekolah</malay>
<malay>kalau aku tak buat</malay> homework <malay>pun dorang macam marah</malay>
so so ya
primary school was fun [lah] cause of <malay>takraw</malay> I mean
ya
#tekong#
(uh) depends
<malay>sebab kalau kalau</malay> (err)
okay usually striker is on your on the #tekong's# right
and then feeder is on the #tekong's# left
ya
<malay>tapi</malay> depending on #tekong# <malay>kalau dia</malay> left hand <malay>ke</malay> ya
(uh) <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
usually striker and jumper for right leg
and then if the #tekong# is left legged then feeder <malay>nak kena belajar campak</malay>
ya
!wah! I think after almost ten years playing
(uh)
I mostly play either #tekong#
<malay>atau</malay> striker
<malay>tapi aku lagi suka</malay> striker
<malay>yang boleh bebas selang</malay>
ya
ya
<malay>takraw</malay> was fun [lah] <malay>tu tu pun macam mana aku macam</malay>
<malay>belajar</malay> [ah] the
the thrill of competition
<malay>macam lawan</malay>
<malay>sekolah-sekolah ni semua masuk</malay> nationals
and then (uh)
gain my own confidence [lah]
primary [eh]
queenstown primary <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> queenstown secondary ya
ya
we never face them before primary school ya nationals
<malay>asal dorang bagus</malay>
[oh] <malay>sebab aku rasa</malay>
okay <malay>aku</malay> remember primary five
(err) that was like the our best performance
for the senior team [lah]
<malay>sebab</malay>
against (err) since the first round <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> beat every school
(uh)
the west zone okay so <malay>kita</malay> east zone (err)
(uh) school <malay>ada</malay> east north (uh) west <malay>dengan</malay> south
<malay>jadi kita dari</malay> east zone
<malay>jadi kita</malay> meet all these different schools <malay>yang kita tak pernah lawan pun tapi kita</malay> beat them [ah]
(err) using basics <malay>kita tak ada macam</malay> fancy fancy <malay>semua tapi</malay> coach <malay>kita ajar macam betul-betul</malay> master your basics
(uh) and I also think that's important [lah] because
as in primary school also if you master your basics you are quite good already
so
<malay>kita</malay> beat all these schools from
I think
in total we beat over
ten close to fifteen schools all the way until (uh) finals
<malay>tak itu yang</malay>
(uh)
[oh]
east zone is #junyuan# primary
ya <malay>tapi aku</malay>
the the one I know is
the powerhouse in nationals are
(uh) is #qihua# #qihua# primary
and
either #qihua# or #junyuan# [ah]
but
ya #junyuan# is the east zone
champions [ah] power house
but
surprisingly national that time primary five <malay>kita</malay> beat <malay>dorang juga</malay> #junyuan# ya so <malay>kita macam kita ada</malay> this momentum [ah] which starting <malay>sampai</malay> finals <malay>kita tak kalah</malay>
ya and then
I vaguely
that's the thing like (err) even though
that was one of our most
the our best performance
it was my worst loss also
because it's like (uh)
personally I felt was possible [lah] but it it came down to my
my (uh) my team
that day first
first team
(uh) <malay>menang</malay> #qihua#
second team <malay>kalah</malay>
and then so is it was one one and then my team had to win [ah] <malay>untuk</malay> champions
and the thing is it was
important to us that because
it will be the first time that our school name will be engraved inside the the the national trophy
so <malay>macam</malay> every year since nineteen ya ninety ninety plus <malay>ada nama ni semua</malay> but never #tampines# north primary school
that was so it was
I I lost [ah] it was a it was an intense match because
by right ya by right it was two rounds okay so
(uh) if
if (err) one side win two rounds means they win already but
best to three ya so
(err) we won the first round
and then they won the second round
so we had a tiebreaker and then they won the third round
so
I was very ya
[a'ah] [sia] <malay>aku nangis rabak</malay> [sia] <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> really felt the responsibility [ah]
[eh] but ya
ya
<malay>sebab kita punya</malay> vice principal <malay>kat situ</malay>
ya
but I think
overall they was still quite proud of us [lah]
but the #tampines# north <malay>tak pernah</malay> achieve this kind of achievement
ya
nationals to be second
like in the in singapore is
was quite
(uh)
it was a big accomplishment [lah]
but ya
okay
performance
wait delta league <malay>apa</malay>
(mm)
[oh] okay
okay
ya ya ya
think <malay>macam</malay>
is is a very big accomplishment [lah]
<malay>untuk kau</malay>
so <malay>aku</malay>
congratulate [lor]
<malay>abeh aku nampak</malay> that time <malay>kau</malay> post <malay>kat</malay> instagram <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dorang</malay> still <malay>cakap apa</malay> boys become last at least
which is demotivating [ah]
yup
yup
I think
<malay>dorang</malay> shouldn't <malay>macam</malay> just celebrate because you get at least fourth <malay>macam dorang</malay> should celebrate the change you know
[ah] that's why
no
!wah! <malay>takde</malay> love life [lah] okay <malay>tinggal macam</malay> four minutes
so
no
okay [lah] (uh) so
<malay>aku</malay> attached
ya together with someone
(uh)
is a girl that I I know since secondary school
so
<malay>aku jumpa dia</malay> through
(uh)
this overseas trip
<malay>dia pergi</malay> cambodia
(uh) it was a service learning trip [lah]
so
<malay>dia</malay>
okay so total sec two that time <malay>ada macam</malay>
seven class
so
she's from (err) two zero two I'm also from two zero two
okay
(uh)
so we went to this overseas trip then
(uh) I tried to make friends [ah] then (uh)
one of them was her
(mm)
back then I was just like making friends with her
then
I think after the trip
then I was just like thinking about I was just like
she's a nice person and all that [lah]
and then (uh)
we were we were quite close after that trip
and then (uh)
during sec three
(uh) we
we were in the same class
okay then
from there started to talk more often and all that
ya <malay>boleh</malay> click [ah] so
but that time sec three (uh) <malay>dia suka orang lain</malay>
[ah] <malay>tapi aku</malay> don't mind <malay>sebab</malay>
it was just to me like a
<malay>macam</malay>
just find her pretty you know <malay>macam</malay> I can
ya ya
so
[oh] ya <malay>aku</malay> okay then
(uh)
late sec three
<malay>yang macam dia punya</malay>
relationship <malay>dia tak</malay> work out
<malay>sebab macam</malay>
that that guy just wanted to play games
like as in like like like literally play game
ya so he's a gamer [ah]
ya so when he play game he also never tell her anything so she left on read
so ya but then [ah]
I think during N levels (uh) we studied together and all that
after N levels we somehow got together [lah]
for what
to ask
(uh)
obviously I ask [ah]
ya ya but
but ya she's
she's chinese
(uh)
she's christian
ya
and then
so
she's the opposite of me [ah] basically in terms of race and religion
because I'm malay (uh) I'm muslim
but she's chinese and christian but
so far I I look past that [ah]
but I still see a future [lah] is just
how things will work out
but ya

okay never mind
can [lah] but it's just like it's very hard for me to like
<malay>tak faham</malay>
<malay>sangat</malay> what you trying to say ya
like there's like a bit like
blur blur <malay>sikit</malay>
anyway right (um)
[oh] for me [kan] [ah] yours is like forty eight hours so is like mine is mine mine was [ah] twenty four hours <malay>tapi</malay> like the lecturer lecturer like give like specific instruction [tau] like the instruction were like very specific so
like she gave like eleven questions eleven questions
eleven questions and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (um) the eleven questions <malay>tu</malay> like [ah] the marks were different [lah] for each questions the marks all very different like some were three marks some were two marks some were ten marks like the maximum was like ten marks [ah] so like (um)
[ah] for like for each question (err) (um) my lecturer specified [ah] like (um) <malay>berapa banyak</malay> words
like there was like minimum of words words in a minimum and then (um) [ah] she also specified [lah] like (um) the (uh)
number of references needed like how many references needed for each ya so it's like like some some of the questions I feel like (um) <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> make <malay>tak</malay> make sense [ah] cause like (err) questions two marks [jer] <malay>atau</malay> three marks but like (uh) <malay>dia nak</malay>
<malay>dia nak</malay> (um) the words like limit <malay>dia</malay> like two hundred fifty like can you imagine like a like a two or three marks question with like a minimum of like hundred fifty to two hundred fifty words
it's quite a lot actually ya I mean if it's like maybe if it's five marks then okay which like I would say it's like worth the marks to write so much but it's like really just two to three marks but like ya so it was like very
very hard [ah] I I don't know it's like (um) it's the questions were not hard it's just that I find that (um)
we had to like really (um) arrange like how do I how do we answer it like to meet the requirements so it was like (um) time consuming [lah] [ah] which explains why maybe she like <malay>kasi</malay> us twenty four hours <malay>untuk buat</malay>
ya
eleven essays
ya twenty four hours eleven essays I didn't like <malay>tak tidur</malay> cause like ya I mean it's not that I didn't take breaks in between [ah] but then I did take a lot of breaks in between to be honest
cause like
cause
ya ya I did I finish way way ahead of (um) the the the the submission period
[lah] cause I cause I honestly feel that (um) the longer the paper right the more you will drag the more you will procrastinate
you what I mean ya
ya and then then <malay>nanti</malay> last last you'll be like rushing rushing and then like (err) everything is like all over the place then you'll be like panic and then like you know and then like for I like what (um) like for for me that the twenty four hours (uh) <malay>punya</malay> exam it was like <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) it was <malay>penat</malay> [ah] but then like
but then like (uh) how do I say this <malay>dia macam</malay>
you you
the questions were okay like just now I say [kan] it was just like okay the it just takes a lot of time and then like having to sit in front of a laptop for like long hours is like (uh) my back was like crying for help
my back crying for help and then ya and (um) like <malay>mata sakit</malay> and everything so <malay>macam</malay> (err) no it's not very like ya it's the worst [ah] I would say the whole the whole
ya from from I think like from having like online lectures to like online exams it's just
it's just the whole the whole thing is not like helpful at all like the whole in like for like studying something right it's like not conducive at all I I feel like being at home
studying at home like like managing like things alone no managing like having like classes at home it's very it's not conducive at all
ya cause like you have like family members around and then people are doing different things in the background and then you can't really focused and then it's like affecting your (um) attention and then you get distracted and then you will like get up every now and then to go to the kitchen and then get something you know
it's not like (err) I don't know I just feel like it's not conducive at all to be at home and having like lectures or exams is the worst
it's the worse [eh] and then like (um) like like like (uh)
my results ya it was it was it was it was surprisingly okay I like I like same as you [ah] I expected like worse cause I feel like (um) some of the modules they were like quite (uh) heavy
they quite heavy and then like the the workload was also very heavy so like
it took a lot of like my time and energy like completing most of the coursework so it's like I I I've I was like very very (um) drained throughout the whole semester like mentally drained physically drained so it's like (mm) like I was quite satisfied with (um) my results [lah] cause
I think the I think the lecturers are being (uh) quite lenient [lah]
like if they weren't lenient maybe I would don't think <malay>boleh lepas</malay>
ya ya
ya
cause like you know you know there are times like (um) (uh) like I I attended like online lectures but then like <malay>macam</malay> like I was there but I was asleep
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[eh] you know what was funny I I've been in the same situation
ya ya ya serious <malay>tak bedek</malay>
all okay cause I had this like (um) [ah] I <malay>ada kelas ni</malay> eight thirty [tau] eight thirty in the morning so like
I mean being at home obviously your <malay>macam</malay> sleeping schedule <malay>semua</malay> all over the place [kan] like you just like you will sleep at like three like two like very late <malay>lepastu</malay> like it's a struggle to wake up in the morning obviously so like ya but then like even though like (uh) (um) the what <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
the attendance was like not compulsory but lecturers still took note of who attended class right
ya so I didn't want to like affect my attendance so like like every time like eight thirty I will wake up just in time like for the lecturer to share the like google meet link [ah] I would join <malay>lepastu</malay> the minute I join and then like right [ah] <malay>terus</malay> I I would just go to sleep
and then every time when I wake up the class is done like the lecturer is not even there anymore then she left the google meet and I'm still there I mean I I honestly think (uh) I <malay>bukan sorang</malay> cause [ah] when I woke up then I will see like two to three people
in in the google meet and I'm like okay I think we are all in the same boat ya cause no I I really feel like <malay>macam</malay>
cannot [ah]
I really cannot I mean physically physical classes eighty thirty I really feel like it's already (um) not a good idea to like take up eight thirty classes [ah] <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] online like <malay>tak boleh</malay> !oi!
so I'm like virtually I'm there but I'm really not physically I'm just somewhere else
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay> lecturers you <malay>semua</malay> like
they were were they like mostly lenient or like they were do you had like some <malay>macam</malay> trouble <malay>juga</malay> with certain lecturers
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]
ya
[ah] [ah] [ah]
(uh huh) (uh)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) <malay>faham</malay>
[ah] cause
for me like [ah] for me right (um)
most of my lecturers okay [lah] I I guess like they are trying to make it things easy for us and also for them I mean it's it's two-way [kan] <malay>macam</malay> if they make things harder for us it will be harder for them also so it's like they were trying their best I guess and cause it's <malay>semua benda macam</malay> very <malay>baru untuk semua orang</malay>
I think everyone <malay>macam masih nak</malay> adapting to the whole new situations so it's like (uh) I I appreciate that (uh) lecturers I <malay>macam</malay> they were they were okay [lah] but then I did have <malay>macam</malay> trouble <malay>dengan</malay> some
lecturers [ah] cause like I don't know why [ah] <malay>tak tahu kenapa</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like I <malay>ada satu</malay> lecturer <malay>ni</malay> she was like (um)
I don't know why she wanted things to she wanted to make things more difficult for us you know like
I mean ya I don't know I don't know why [ah] cause I've I I I don't (err) I don't <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak</malay> I don't really like her style of like how she organises the whole (um) the way she conducts a whole the whole class it's like
(um) cause it's online [kan] <malay>abeh macam</malay> she doesn't
she expects us to (err) <malay>macam</malay>
gone through everything I mean technically of course we have to go through everything on our own mostly like have to do our readings and everything I mean <malay>faham</malay> [lah] we have to do that obviously but then it was like I would say like ninety percent like the whole coursework that ninety percent had to be depended on ourselves
ya so <malay>macam</malay> it wasn't helpful [lah] she was expecting us to only come to her only <malay>bila kita ada</malay> questions so it was like very hard for me like [ah] <malay>apa</malay> [eh] like <malay>macam</malay> cause especially I don't have my books with me so like
I I left my books in malaysia we had to rush back to singapore like during the so we didn't I didn't have time to pack up whatever I need so it was just like take whatever I whatever I needed and then just <malay>balik</malay> singapore but then like you know so I had I had to leave my books and I really I really I use my books for references like to do readings and everything
ya I mean cause I I don't like I don't like online I really cannot like absorb things online so I prefer like reading like physical books and then like extracting the like <malay>macam apa tu</malay> the points and everything but then my lecturer was like
she was like as like for like every week
[ah] <malay>dia akan cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>dia akan cakap</malay> okay this is the topic we're going to [ah] this is the topic that you have to you have to read any questions ask me and then she would upload right upload like pre-recorded lectures with slides but only like
like three three or four slides she would go through so like the slides was like was like nine nine to ten minutes and that's it so it's like she only goes through like first not even like first part it's like very small part of the whole chapter so had to be we had to really go every go through everything on ourselves
on our own so <malay>macam</malay> I was like [ah] it wasn't like helpful at all I was like I didn't understand like a lot of things and then like I was like having trouble then I tried my best to like find resources online whatever it is [lah] to to understand to <malay>faham</malay> [kan]
cause like you know it's it's heavy it's it's it's also a very heavy (um) course so it's like I I feel like it wasn't helpful at all and then she was always like she's very high expectations on her students [ah] I I honestly feel that way I mean
I I understand that she she wants like <malay>kita nya</malay> level to be like of really university students <malay>tapi macam</malay>
[ah] in the situation we're in right now is like not really helpful [lah]
I mean cause cause she makes everything a bit complicated like the whole process of the whole coursework it was like very very <malay>leceh</malay> like from the from the submissions and then to the assignments like she was like very particular about a lot of things they were <malay>macam banyak gila benda nak kena</malay> like we had to follow hers her format
and it was very very <malay>leceh</malay> and then like
it was very <malay>leceh</malay> and then time consuming and everything so and then it was group work and which is which was worse cause (uh) (uh) I had to handle <malay>dengan</malay> all those (um) group members who are just useless
so it was like more pressure on like whoever is participating in a group work
we just like you know it's supposed to be a group assignment and then like like out of like six people like only three
working team members which was hard [lah] cause I mean you know assignments are like supposed it's very heavy and it's supposed to be like <malay>macam</malay> equally divided [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> like like the pressure was more on like the lesser lesser working members the more work needs to be done right for each member
so I was like [ah] it was very frustrating cause like for me I don't really like to confront like
members who don't really do their work
like I feel that I don't know I I'm just like (um) <malay>malas</malay> [ah] want to <malay>layan</malay> like
like you know all these drama so I will just be like I do my work like whoever wants to do it do it and then we just proceed if people care enough they would ask the progress [ah] of it but you know some did some did not so it was like [ah] whatever like really I don't care cause for me I care about my grades like you did <malay>dorang tak kesah</malay> then <malay>dorang punya pasal</malay> [ah]
but then like for me like I really I really care about my grades so it's like for me I don't want to deal with like such like such group members so is like [ah] whatever [ah] <malay>suka hati</malay> [ah] <malay>nak buat pape pun boleh</malay> [lah] ya like ya it's like
like <malay>apa tu</malay>
(uh) <malay>apa nama dia</malay> like you know like <malay>bila</malay> physically like with physically it's very hard to meet up with group members like what else online right it's worse
especially when like
(um) like group members don't reply to your texts and they just like they only leave you on read everytime frustrating [kan]
ya exactly ya ya exactly
and then
(um) and then (uh) like for like certain my other lecturers like they they decided like like yours [ah] similar to yours like <malay>dorang kasi kita</malay> choose (um) <malay>nak apa tu nak</malay> individual <malay>atau</malay> group work so it was like okay [lah] I I honestly prefer individual assignments so I don't have to like deal with anyone you know you just get to settle it on your own
ya ya ya
ya ya ya I mean
ya ya ya I mean it's your own your own (uh) I mean it's kind of scary [lah] to do be doing assignments like individually <malay>tapi macam</malay> you know it's much easier cause you get things done faster I mean not faster faster but you know what I mean [kan] like faster in terms of like you just have you just you just do it on do it on your own don't have to like go having to ask or like you know divide work and everything
ya ya exactly exactly exactly ya it's all like on your own so <malay>macam</malay> settle [lah] <malay>senang</malay> [kan] <malay>habis cerita</malay> [eh] but serious I'm not looking forward to the upcoming semester or the summer semester cause I'm taking are you taking the summer semester

[ah] (uh) ya exactly so it's like especially when when things are like like all these sensitive issues right I really wish <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> I <malay>boleh</malay> just <malay>cakap</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi</malay>
(mm) I really can't I really can't I don't know how but I really can't cause
I I feel that (um) my knowledge or like current issues it's not like I'm not fully equipped on that like I'm still like I still it's not I'm not I don't like (um) follow up on what what's happening [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> like I feel like
no matter like how much I'm updated with what's going on I feel like I'm still don't have enough knowledge like like the lack of knowledge in me to really <malay>macam</malay> go out there and speak up about things like this [ah]
I really I really
respect those people who really have that confidence to really to really you know just just say whatever and they don't even care if like I mean especially when people like (um) people reply and they have like (err) like there was there's like a clash of opinions and things right then they will have like a they will somehow have like a certain discussion
like between like another user and then it's like [oh] no I would I will never do that I mean even though like
ya ya ya I mean like for me <malay>macam kadang-kadang</malay> like I feel I <malay>takut kat walaupun</malay>
my my twitter is like private like private account <malay>tapi</malay>
!huh! <malay>tapi</malay> I I I feel like <malay>macam</malay> like even if I were to tweet it out like I I I will just so scared of being judged even though like my my followers are actually quite limited [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> you know you just have that like fear of people like judging you even if it's not judging you people I I'm I'm afraid of people having like certain like impression of me for having like certain opinions on things you know
[kan]
ya exactly exactly
ya ya exactly [oh] really I mean then
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
[ah] [ah] yes yes yes

in a way you know you you just want it to be like a general kind of like (um) discussion like a healthy one [lah] like you don't end up being like ya you know end up like in like fights or whatever I don't know it's just really cool I find it like <malay>macam</malay> very cool for people to be doing that

for okay <malay>bila</malay> comes to like my love life right I I'm the type of person <malay>yang</malay> if we vibe we vibe [ah] so if like from the start if we can't really click then I don't think that that's like hope in it so I will just like you know what it's not it's not happening so ya so to be matchmake right (mm) I think for someone like me it's gonna be hard [lah] it's gonna be very hard
ya cause
I
[ah] I <malay>lebih</malay> prefer things to be like to happen like naturally
I mean I mean I know [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> like when it comes to like matchmaking like it's like it it takes time you have to like get to know the person and stuff
which <malay>macam</malay> I am open to like getting to know people but then the the hard part is like is like when you when you really get to know the person and everything it's like it's it's a whole new thing where you will have to decide whether like is it really going to work out or like you know those kind of thing so <malay>macam</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> I don't know I'm so like to answer your question I <malay>tak</malay> sure [ah] whether I can actually
go on with it or not it depends who depends on the like candidate that it's been picked for me but then again like [ah] similar [lah] to your parents my parents <malay>tak macam gitu</malay> [ah] so ya
<malay>dorang macam [ah] <malay>cari sendiri</malay> they don't ya they don't meddle with my love life
I mean I would say my non-existent love life [lah] as of right now
so ya
maybe maybe maybe if I'm like desperate enough then maybe [lah]
maybe like really like reach a certain age then I think I should get married and I don't have anyone then maybe [ah] I will resort to that but like
(um) I <malay>nak</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> you know I feel like I've other things to settle think like love is like the last thing I would want to think about [ah]
like I think I have other things to like think about like right now like like I need I need to figure out what I want to do with my degree
and then you know from there on like more on like working on myself first [lah] then I can think of like things cause like I don't know like to have like <malay>sekarang</malay> to have love life like right now
it's like (mm) not much ideal for me [ah] cause I feel that I don't even have time for myself like I'm just so busy with school so like to to have like someone in my life right now it's like (um)
ya it's not that it's going to distract me [ah] it's just that I don't I don't know if I can actually fully commit to it you know
ya it's more of that cause like you know obviously school would come first I just so busy with school I'll just be so caught up with school I don't think I would have time for my significant other if I were to ever have one like right now

why
ya cause K
I don't want to take private okay <malay>aku tak nak</malay> stereotype [ah] but you look at the people who take private O level
[ha]
I I got that mindset [lah] last time
and cause you know you don't know anyone there then you want to ask the teacher also you are not familiar with
then might as well I just fully focus as a full-time student just retake
<malay>tebalkan muka</malay> [ah]
and apparently I I was the only one <malay>yang</malay> retake
the rest all go out cause previous batches right they do have seniors coming back just to take O level but then now I don't know everyone like very ego don't want to come back <malay>malu</malay> I guess so ya [lah] <malay>tapi ustazah siapa</malay> #masniah# <malay>tak salah</malay>

previous seniors [ah] like they retake <malay>tapi</malay> they are exempted from
unnecessary modules [ah]

the parents <malay>macam</malay> [oh] you too young you know why why you want to get married so young you know and then they are like no I want to get married now now now what do you think
<malay>haram</malay> [lah] like that
[oh]
[ah] bad image like that [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
true true
okay then (err) let's see if (err) they are they are married already then after that (um) they they are not stable
okay so it's like (err) <malay>kes macam</malay> (err) okay scenario [ah] it's like (err)
both of them after O-levels maybe they don't want to work anymore I mean they don't want to school anymore so they took part time job then they feel like (oo) got so so much opportunity in this part time jobs so they want to grow from those part time jobs
[ah] but they're not stable yet [ah] like they still ya like don't have any plans yet for the future but they know they want to get married
like papers in papers like at eighteen I want to get married now
what are your thoughts
!oof!
okay
okay focus on marriage first [ah] would you allow your children to do that
(mm) okay
true okay
in singapore
[oh] okay
like agree
they <malay>halalkan</malay> like that [ah]
[ah] [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya he's the one that kind of thing [ah]
ya ya ya ya
true ya
ya
and you're already married anyway [kan]
[ah]
true
okay then it brings me to the next question
(uh) if let's say like (err) you you get into a relationship already [ah] then the guy is like I want to take it to the next level but you you're in a fresh relationship you know
what okay so
the the major question is like how long do you think is a good time until you should move on to the next step in life
ya time
[ah]
okay okay
(mm)
okay
play around you
<malay>macam apa</malay> (mm) <malay>macam nak</malay> date other chicks or what
(mm)
!huh!
they call it off for eight years' [oh]
eight years [oh] my the fact that you actually drop so easily [ah] the eight years
[ah]
[ah]
interesting ya
!aiya!
ease [sia]
I think I think by the fourth year [ah] <malay>aku dah</malay> settle down [sia] <malay>aku dah macam</malay> damn this is long and it seems like much of a long shot see
but but to me [ah] by the third or fourth year [ah] it will give me like a sense of <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] I like I want to to settle down tie a knot you know start the family planning you know like
start my future [lah] you know
<malay>baik</malay>
yes [sia]
(oo) !wah!
(mm)
true true okay [ah]
okay we are
next year is our third year [ah]
(mm)
<malay>boleh juga</malay>
[ah] that's the thing [lah] because of the current situation right like right now we are both schooling <malay>abeh tak</malay> stable so even if we wanted to tie the knot <malay>kita masih takde</malay>
like <malay>tak</malay> ready because of money ya
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
true true
<malay>tapi</malay> honestly speaking my parents are like scared because like we are okay both I think I can understand from both parents point of view because they like (err)
they don't want both of us to <malay>macam sekolah</malay> halfway <malay>sekolah</malay> halfway then after that (err) drop out because what pregnancy or we need money to to support [ah] to support each other or like (err)
that's basic adult things [ah] adult marriage things you know ya like [oh] we have to save money to buy house you know that kind of thing
so I think that's what both our parents are looking at [ah]
but ya [lah] like what you say [ah] it can be on papers you know so that is not a sin for us to be together
(mm)
(mm)
true
I to me I ya I see it from that point of you [ah] to me [ah] because honestly being this old
I don't want to commit anymore sins [eh] and it's not that (err) <malay>macam bukan aku yang tanggung</malay> fully [tau] is like my parents around who has to <malay>tanggung</malay> for my sins also so it's like !aiya! I don't know [lah] <malay>susah</malay> I don't mind getting married now
but it's just that like you know older generation thinking I guess I don't know
but ya what do you think
true
ya [sia] actually true and it's workaholics
<malay>macam</malay> I think it's kind of true you know I have a lot of
(err) friends yang <malay>macam</malay> [ah] don't want [ah] I I need money I need money like (err) <malay>aku takde duit nanti tak boleh hidup</malay> and I'm like but money is not everything [what] you know there there is a lot of things that accumulates to life you know [ah] <malay>macam entah</malay>
I mean people different (err) different mindset [lah] [ah]
(mm)
it's true [oh] my god that [one] that [one] is a major issue in singapore [sia] like money is such
money just plays a big part [eh] in singapore
<malay>macam kalau kau tak ada duit kau macam hancur</malay> [ah]
okay [lah] I mean
okay #ang moh# (err)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
true ya ya ya okay [lah] it is
actually (err) okay when I was in [kan] everything there was so slow
like nobody was rushing for everything traffic was normal <malay>tak takde orang yang macam marah marah</malay> you know <malay>kat</malay> singapore <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>semua orang nak</malay> boom boom boom rush rush rush even in public transport especially in public transport <malay>semua orang macam</malay> [oh] !alamak! <malay>aku kena masuk</malay>
like I have to get in if not cannot [sia] late for (err) late for work you know that kind of thing
[ah]
<malay>entah</malay> when I was still
[ah]
correct [eh] okay [lah] jam is another thing in singapore because we're so small <malay>ambil macam</malay> the I don't know in singapore is so dense the popular the popular <malay>apa</malay> the population [ah] yes is so dense and like there's this
a lot of people coming in [ah] and I I feel like it's not stopping you see true I think a lot of people ya
actually a lot of people want to (err) <malay>masuk</malay> singapore you know to because singapore is safe in terms of the health and all that and <malay>kita macam</malay> number one [tau] tip top [tau]
like my dad boss they actually when COVID started in singapore right they flew to spain and then after that <malay>bila</malay> spain <malay>kena dia cepat cepat balik ke</malay> singapore
ya dead rich but the point is like
(err) very late very like (um) she said that
singapore's (err) healthcare is the best
<malay>macam kalau kau sakit ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>ada</malay> disease <malay>siapa kau tak tahu apa-apa kau datang</malay> singapore singapore can like handle it you know
because singapore puts there are healthcare like one of the priorities of the country so I feel like (err) singapore is number one [lah] for healthcare
ya like a lot of people come to singapore like I saw a lot of people okay there's this [ah]
web for (err) what's that called
donation like that okay and then like (err) a lot of children from asia kind of thing <malay>dorang macam</malay> (err)
they come to singapore to get treatments ya so like (err) this [one] is cancer so they quickly come to singapore to get a treatment for cancer this [one] got tumour so you come to singapore do all this
and then another [one] is ya no [lah] I mean it's not that they do it but a lot people want to come to singapore to get that treatments because it's reliable
then (um) I don't know [lah] a lot of people just come to singapore just for healthcare
ya
no [oh] my god you know healthcare is so bad [lah]
is so bad
[ah] [ah] [ah]
I okay come on [lah] singapore is
(err) accessible okay like
got clinic here hospital is nearby in every (err) town area and then that kind of thing [ah] correct but in if you live in the suburbs it's so hard to get to the hospital it's probably like one hour drive away
twenty minutes away thirty minute away that kind of thing
suburbs
suburbs is like farm area <malay>macam</malay> all the rural [ah] [ah] [ah] like rural area like people
who have a lot of land then they do like farming you know that kind of thing ya so it's those like with big plotted lands [lah] it's not necessarily like they are not rich
but it's just that they have a lot of land and they want to do a lot of things like farming you know that all that kind of thing that we cannot do in singapore [lah] basically
so ya there are okay [lah] as
they do have the land that's all that is the good thing about they have land to do a lot of things but then sometimes they don't take
ya they don't take advantage of what they've been given [lah]
so
!oof!
ya [hor]
I believe singapore because like singapore I usually like if any land any
<malay>betul</malay>
I remember <malay>dekat</malay> #punggol# <malay>macam</malay> everything must empty <malay>takde barang</malay> you know there was a a lot of land <malay>yang kita boleh pakai</malay>
and then <malay>kita macam</malay>
you know last time I (err) we go <malay>pancing</malay> [tau]
<malay>pancing dekat macam</malay> illegal places
[eh] <malay>aku pancing</malay> [lah]
<malay>dekat macam</malay>
(err) how to say [ah] <malay>macam hutan-hutan</malay> [oh] <malay>begitu kita pergi kita</malay> drive <malay>dengan kereta masuk hutan mana entah</malay> random
serious <malay>tak</malay> joke <malay>ni betul kalau ada orang dengar ni</malay> confirm <malay>dorang cakap aku pernah ni pak cik pak cik</malay> confirm <malay>tahu punya</malay>
<malay>betul</malay>
so (err) I think <malay>kita pancing</malay> [ah] but then after that I think the government know about it [lah] so no choice right (err) they I think they close <malay>macam</malay> a lot of the places [ah] and then (err) <malay>kita</malay> the only place <malay>kita boleh pergi</malay> is
#bedok# jetty #changi# you know ya
so I guess this I understand [lah] why the government is building all this
flats because population <malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay>makin besar</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> [ah] foreigners also coming in a lot of foreign talent
then (err) <malay>apa</malay> singapore <malay>pun</malay> is a district for business [tau] <malay>kau tahu</malay> like a lot of people come here to make deals and like because it's a common ground <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>si</malay> #kim jong-un# <malay>datang kat</malay> singapore <malay>dengan si</malay> donald <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang datang ke sini</malay> cause we are neutral

they have very little stuff like (um) maybe like three at the counter they okay actually they have a lot of staff [tau]
<malay>macam</malay> okay they needed this staff to <malay>jaga</malay> the cinema halls and they needed this staff to save entry then they needed counter staff
and then they needed like people who do food food and drinks
so I saw like
but now they change [seh] they change to (err) counter (err) <malay>satu orang</malay> so the counter will take all your orders <malay>macam kau nak tiket ni</malay> you want some drinks okay (uh) when you pay already there's this like queueing system <malay>macam</malay> McDonald's
then [oh] got wider go beyond they got to [ah] so (err) twenty then
[a'ah]
[ah]
so <malay>apa ni</malay>
so <malay>kita tunggu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> McDonald's <malay>begitu</malay>
so they have more people [lah] actually but it's just that it's very little like (uh) one each
but it's extra work
you know it's extra work
even at Timezone <malay>tu kali aku pergi</malay>
ya <malay>aku pergi</malay> Timezone
[eh] Timezone <malay>bes</malay> [seh] but anyway I went to Timezone also
ya true <malay>makan duit</malay> a lot
but I always go when there's the double deal the we buy fifty get hundred dollars
that hundred dollars that you know when the ya I'm always up to date okay I
ya I'm always up to date okay I love Timezone and I got so many points
ya
but then
(uh) same [lah] like they just <malay>kesian aku tengok</malay> a lot of people do a lot work [seh] then <malay>macam</malay> to me it's extra work [ah]
ya speaking of that
did you see the one of the ministers suggests that singaporeans like they if they want they they can take second jobs [seh]
!aiyo! is not the east coast [lah] #laila# [ah]
<malay>macam mana</malay>
!oof! <malay>kenapa pula</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
ya
true
[ah] ya
#ish# !woo! !woo! !woo! chill
ya [sia]
ya
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but if okay [lah] let's say if (err)
even if we were to take this second job right how to okay for example we take you as an example no we take you as an example okay you work six days a week you know
where can you find time to slot in the second jobs [sia]
!oof!
Grab money come out more money come out [what]
<malay>minyak</malay>

electricity ya correct [what]
so how
ya your places
your place
[ah] declaration form
[ah]
ya ya actually some some workplace like that you know ya so
ya [lah]
(mm)
true and also if you could get you in trouble [seh]
right
(mm)
ya [sia] [eh] speaking about that and plus even if you commit such crime like that if you get caught <malay>lagi</malay> like
like
then you just getting yourself into trouble [seh]
but ya [lah] I I think you brought up a good point [seh] like I think this second job that okay maybe if it's a side hustle <malay>yang tak</malay> take so much of your time [ah] then maybe can [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah] home based [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
true
but then this second job doesn't have
right
ya
<malay>macam</malay> what
like there are I I guess got good and bad [lah] like to do this okay the good is ya more income [lah]
true
as in what
(mm)
(mm)
ya that is if you have a family
no who say no family no problem what about your parents
what about your social life [sia]
like [eh] !walao! I'll be angry [seh] if I have no social life <malay>boleh mati</malay> [sia]

okay the time or money [eh] okay <malay>kalau</malay> if let's say I am married [lah]
(oo) right now [ah] right now okay [lah] like money [lah] money
being twenty three I have no time already [eh] okay I think if I'm twenty three and single I still have time [ah]
ya because there are so many singles at their credit issues [what] thirty forty plus and they are still going good some of my lecturers are single and they are like still doing fine they are happy with their life [ah]
[ah] that's why that's why I say money is <malay>tak</malay> not so bad [ah] it can be a choice [ah]
and so like [kan]
!oof!
tough [one] [ah] [eh]
(mm)
I think being in singapore <malay>macam</malay> very I think just singapore [lah] ya
keeping it to <malay>macam</malay> singapore <malay>punya</malay> contexts [ah]
I I think we are always chasing for both
but it' so hard to juggle both at the same time [ah]
[ah]
that's why [ah] [ah] [seh]
[oh] <malay>tu lagi</malay> (ugh)
(mm)
although I have to say that <malay>macam</malay> (uh)
they are promoting more [ah] like about mental health (uh) mental health you know mental health issues a bit more than before [ah]
like (uh)
like that [one] that [one] can say that the government is trying to improve because (err) there are more ministers talking about it and <malay>macam</malay> a lot of people are more open to listening and like they don't just <malay>macam</malay> categorising as <malay>orang gila</malay> you know that kind of thing
they they still listen [ah] so I I think still not bad [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah] [oh] my god I remember
that [one] <malay>rabak</malay> [seh] <malay>semua orang macam [ah] ni</malay> confirm stress [jer]

like what (ugh)
<malay>tak mau sensitive</malay> [seh] ya <malay>tapi</malay> ya [lah] (err) I think it's
it's raising more when even if it's not in singapore [kan]

what ya ya [eh] <malay>apa</malay> [sial] this is this seriously <malay>macam</malay> for real I've never heard of this [sia]
I was like
I was so shocked and I was thinking to myself what if I had that disorder or what if someone else had this order how am I going to handle the situation
[oh] my
god
!walao!

common <malay>sekarang</malay> then
thailand our favourite then
philippines
ya so I felt like
<malay>kalau macam kita dah tahu berbual ni semua macam</malay> nice right like
third wish yes that's my third wish but
I also want to be a certified one
and I felt that
rather than I learn
since it's a wish right <malay>dia macam bukan macam</malay> magic <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> magic <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
[eh] <malay>sudah aku nak letak</malay> magic I can speak a lot of language and be certified rather than
I want to study don't need [lah] <malay>tak payah</malay>
so what about you
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
talking about family gathering
you know about <malay>yang seratus</malay> dollar the one that government wants to like the hundred dollar voucher right
going through by the singpass I read at straits times
so they say you can go for like staycation at hotels
or like amusement park [ah] all that <malay>ada</malay> tourism
so
I think that one we can make it happen without a wish
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
you want to picnic <malay>ke nak</malay> overnight
that's nice actually we can actually but
we just wait [lah] for the further announcement
if we can
maybe for like one hotel we can use like two names right like mine like for example you and your husband one room right
can use both of your hundred dollars so you guys just need to fork out like what
like forty or thirty dollar more like thirty to forty dollar more only
rather than <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau dia dua ratus lebih</malay> then
you can only use your your own only [kan] <malay>abeh bayar seratus lebih gila</malay>
then
maybe we can picnic <malay>ke apa</malay> right what you said picnic then <malay>kalau kita</malay> picnic <malay>pun kita nak kena keluarkan duit banyak</malay>
then if we picnic
if we cannot use the hundred dollars money we need to fork out our own money it's like
no [lah] we put that aside first then we
<malay>macam</malay> hotel then chalet <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>untuk</malay> staycation <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] (mm) actually not bad [ah] I think the idea is not bad <malay>abeh kita boleh</malay> barbecue <malay>lagi</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kalau kita macam</malay>
chalet
chalet <malay>ke</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> chalet <malay>tu boleh</malay> barbecue [pe]
but then we also need to spend money on the barbecue I mean like food food we always need to spend money on food [lah]
forever food and our transportation
and then <malay>macam rumah</malay> okay <malay>rumah</malay> maybe like <malay>macam</malay> if it's like four hundred we can just
like
share among us
so it's like <malay>satu orang</malay> like <malay>berapa berapa puluh</malay> dollar <malay>gitu</malay> or hundred something like that
then the food also we can ask them to fork out like about twenty dollars or twenty or thirty dollars <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>untuk makan dengan minum</malay> okay [ah] nice then we can just cook or we can like <malay>macam</malay> chalet or what we <malay>tempat dia boleh masak</malay> [kan] so
we can just buy our groceries <malay>ke apa</malay>
then we <malay>macam simpan dalam</malay> fridge then <malay>esok tu</malay> breakfast <malay>boleh masak</malay>
<malay>semua</malay> then
I think by lunch <malay>gitu</malay> we need to
book out already [kan] so okay [lah]
I think it's nice already such a nice plan but then when you say about the celebration
[kan] celebration also need more money
because right <malay>takkan kita nak buat macam</malay> so called birthday party <malay>tak ada</malay> decoration <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
decoration need money also
I mean we can buy <malay>macam dekat</malay> daiso <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] so <malay>dua</malay> dollar <malay>dua</malay> dollar <malay>murah ataupun kita boleh beli kat</malay> neighbourhood kind of shop [kan]
so it's cheaper but still we still need to fork out our own money
so I'm not sure if <malay>kalau</malay> (mm) but it's a nice idea [lah] to <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> both
party together like that
because we can <malay>macam</malay> save up a bit of money rather than <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>satu</malay> birthday party <malay>lepas tu</malay> birthday party <malay>lagi habis duit</malay> then
(um) you know that a
<malay>tu</malay> confirm confirm <malay>kena bayar lagi</malay> [eh] service <malay>tu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(mm)
nice but I don't think <malay>macam</malay> I don't think hotel is a nice choice if you want to do that kind of thing
cause hotel confirm have their own <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know they will have their own kind of rules and regulation <malay>macam</malay> like after this timing that timing you cannot do this kind of thing right
ya
so so I think if we want to do that kind of thing right we should put off the hotel
we should use chalet or something rather than that because <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> rules or regulations <malay>susah</malay> [ah] <malay>kita pun nak buat macam</malay> we want to save
cause <malay>sekali tak</malay> save [eh] (uh) government <malay>pula</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] like some agency <malay>datang ke apa sebab kita buat bising ke apa habis kena bayar lebih</malay> [eh]
ya [lah] marina is nice [lah]
cause the place is big but
at least at least there's this one (uh) one place where I know
(err) <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> rooftop like that [ah]
not not really rooftop <malay>dia macam</malay> not rooftop or shelter <malay>tapi macam</malay> indoor <malay>sikit</malay>
[ah] we can we can find the place around there so <malay>kalau hujan ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>kita tak kena</malay>
because marina west coast east coast <malay>tu semua</malay> is all
outdoor [pe]
so <malay>kalau hujan ke apa</malay> we still <malay>boleh lepak depan situ</malay>
cause that time when I went (uh) to marina
for a picnic with my friends we actually <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) I think like halfway halfway through the day it was drizzling
<malay>abeh</malay> okay maybe <malay>kalau kalau macam hujan lebat sudah kita</malay> pack up <malay>sudah hujan lebat</malay> [kan]
but if it's like drizzling we just stay there [ah]
because it's like !alah! <malay>sikit-sikit</malay> [jer] point point point
<malay>gitu</malay> [jer] [kan]
so
we
<malay>pergi cari</malay>
I mean we got the what is called [ah] <malay>yang besar tu</malay> parasol [eh]
parasol whatever [lah]
[ah] <malay>yang payung besar tu</malay>
we brought that also so <malay>kita letak betul-betul kat tepi situ</malay> we <malay>letak</malay> so
[ah] <malay>macam ada</malay> what is it <malay>macam terpercik</malay> [eh] is it <malay>terpercik macam</malay> <malay>hujan kena</malay>
[ah] splash [lah]
like
if we <malay>macam takut hujan</malay> splash on us then we put the (uh) the <malay>payung besar</malay>
(mm) even though we under the <malay>macam</malay> cover [kan] but still [lah] we just
<malay>letak pasal takut kena juga</malay>
but still like nice because
<malay>kita tak kena</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal kita letak payung besar tu</malay>
I think I think our cousin have I think [ah] I don't know if they already throw it away or not but still (uh) that time I remember they have it
but we can just ask
[oh]
<malay>macam</malay> glamping is it <malay>dia macam</malay> wait [ah]
ya ya this one [ah]
(mm) nice we can go this kind
(mm)
but I don't think
our family let us stay until that that night
like very
late night
if we outside there
you understand like
you know how our family is what so
I don't think <malay>dia orang akan macam</malay>
(err) <malay>kau nak</malay> stay <malay>pukul sebelas sebelas lebih dua belas gitu</malay> I don't think
they let us
(mm)
I not sure later after this we can google [ah] whether if we can overnight I think it's a good idea we can just take this one instead
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I think that's good though but rather than <malay>macam</malay> we since we going to overnight or something right I don't think we should
(err) take <malay>macam</malay> morning like that no we should like <malay>macam petang petang gitu</malay>
we should rent from <malay>petang petang</malay>
<malay>sampai ke malam</malay> like that so <malay>sampai esok pagi ke sampai esok petang tu</malay> ya we should rent that kind
so that <malay>macam</malay>
we confirm know we won't sleep [what]
[oh] nice everyone also can cycle right is it
our cousin all can cycle right
it's either the elder or the younger one right that cannot cycle
don't need to cycle [lah]
(mm)
more like a saturday morning
or what
because I think saturday
that's why I say we should rent from evening
then tomorrow morning we go cycle
after the birthday party what nonsense right then we can go cycling
ya
then we go cycle or like
we can cycle from the other side to the other side what you know like got mcdonald's all that so we can just
breakfast
but still it's a
better place I think because there's like a lot of convenience there
actually I want to skate [eh]
but I I don't know <malay>kalau ada macam ada orang lain yang tahu</malay> skate <malay>macam</malay> you don't know how to skate [kan]
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>abeh kalau aku</malay> roller blade <malay>sorang</malay> [eh] <malay>sedih</malay> [sia] <malay>aku orang semua</malay> cycle cycle cycle <malay>aku</malay> [eh] roller blade <malay>dengan aku</malay>
no one will no one wants to roller blade with me
then I feel sad [ah]
I will feel lonely if I only roller blade alone
like but I want to cycle also but I also want to roller blade so it's like
okay
you okay I think I think forget it about roller blade [lah] no one can roller blade with me
it's so sad
why not you roller blade with me I teach you
you want to go snow city I want to go ice rink
but nobody want to go with me
!whoa! okay I think is it is it Snow City can use the hundred dollars
ya
I've never went there before [ah] but still I think you because it's a very cold place right so we need a lot
then you need like a very thick clothes all that
no
(mm)
what about glove
for rental [lah]
(mm)
I don't know I just want to go though I want to feel snow even though it's artificial
but I don't want to eat it
I mean I I felt like eating it but like
everyone say it's dirty so I don't want [ah]
what if people really got like
pee on it or what !eww! but ya still !ee! okay I mean
people won't pee because it's like everyone will see if you pee there
[oh] I remember that time my [eh] my cousin our cousin our cousin said <malay>nak pergi</malay> zoo
<malay>merepek pergi</malay> zoo <malay>pergi</malay> zoo <malay>tengok binatang</malay> [jer]
you want to play with the animal
ya I don't know what what I mean okay maybe our interest like so different like
both of us we don't really like animals <malay>macam</malay> !hey! <malay>kau datang sayang kau tengok-tengok</malay> [jer] <malay>binatang tu</malay>
like
what's more that that you can do over there
maybe <malay>aku tak</malay> appreciate [ah] but
but still I really like that idea of glamping though I want
I seriously want that instead of <malay>macam pergi</malay> to be honest I felt right it's like one of the best choices
<malay>gila</malay> I will just research about it later <malay>lepas tu nanti kita tengok</malay>
how good it is like what's the review and
like how we can book all that
but I think they got to bring their children right
(mm)
that's why I say but okay [ah] okay [ah] it's a nice idea
then we can go for like normal outing also you know I feel like we should just
go out like normally
cause I felt like <malay>kita macam tak</malay> spend <malay>banyak</malay> time
<malay>yang macam</malay> cousins we don't really have much
time to spend together you got like
you working they working
I'm like I'm schooling all that <malay>macam</malay> all our timing clashes so we don't we have the time to <malay>macam jalan-jalan</malay> together

so we need to expect we need to tell them we need like about
six bottles
of drinks six to six to eight bottles because
we are going to like have birthday celebration <malay>ni semua</malay> from

then I totally forgot that she texted
then I felt bad then I told my mum about it [lah] I was like
[oh] the is still trying to convince me to like (um) for her
<malay>tapi</malay> like I don't want then I felt like
I was guilt tripped
ya
that's about it and I'm excited for the zoom meeting
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
so let me tell you how my day went
so <malay>semalam</malay> like
I told my mum and my <malay>kakak</malay> was like
we're going out at one
tomorrow which is today
cause like
we wanted to go spotlight and then we want to go
but then
at
okay I woke up at eight
to like clean like cause <malay>apa nama dia</malay> (err) yesterday I spent the whole day shifting
my <malay>almari</malay> from my room to my guest room
then I was doing it myself I had to take out all the <malay>buku-buku</malay>
<malay>semua</malay>
<malay>berat gila</malay>
and then like I was too tired so
I continued today
ya so I woke up at eight when I slept at two
and then I shifted all the I I I <malay>simpan</malay> the book <malay>balik</malay>
then I fell asleep
and then what happened to the one <malay>keluar</malay> you know what time we <malay>keluar</malay> or not we went out like
freaking six ya
so we only went into spotlight and I told you about the patterns that I wanted to <malay>beli</malay> right
busy you know cause okay
I went to spotlight <malay>sebab</malay> I want to find
<malay>kain</malay>
for the inside layer for my mask cause I want to <malay>jahit</malay> for my
family members [kan]
which <malay>tak habis-habis</malay>
ya so I was trying to find a breathable <malay>kain</malay>
then
(err)
but my another
main thing that I wanted to <malay>cari</malay> was the
dress patterns [lah] the one that I told you about that I wanted to
make
[kan]
so
the first thing I did was
like find the <malay>kain</malay>
and then I was like flabbergasted I don't know why
but I was like super
anxious and then and then I walk you know like the entire spotlight
and I forgot to take the the pattern
and (err) and then like (uh) I tried to find the pattern then like I I I went around like the entire
spotlight but I couldn't find it
turns out it was like <malay>dekat dalam</malay>
an <malay>almari</malay>
like a drawer
like in front of a
counter
and then I was like am I allowed to like just pull this out
I didn't know cause no one was
no one was attending to me [ah] so I just like
so I just like did it myself
ya that's about it I will show you but it will make like
sounds
which is
not ideal ya
ya that's about it [lah]
ya
ya
<malay>tadi tadi</malay> while while bathing I was
hello
that's call cheat
<malay>cik saya nak</malay> order
<malay>nak</malay> order <malay>suji boleh</malay>
ya
<malay>tapi</malay> usually like people sell <malay>suji</malay> that
small [kan]
usually it's like this
but have the circular containers [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
as I was saying <malay>tadi</malay>
like while I was
bathing
I was trying to think <malay>macam</malay> like
(err) when is a good time for us to record [lah] cause <malay>macam</malay>
it's very noisy at my neighbourhood
like super noisy
and then
like sometimes I stay up until like five and stuff like that [kan]
at five <malay>masih</malay> very very very <malay>memekak</malay>
like the freaking
am I allowed to say that !huh! like the the motor and the and the cars are like
<malay>memekak gila</malay>
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
but I think it's because of our neighborhood though
cause
it's quite
crowded here and because that time <malay>masa masa</malay> we shot at kim <malay>punya</malay> place
it was
close to this timing and it's quite quiet [lah]
(mm)
<malay>tempat jin bertandang</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
it's the it's the app that you told me about right that time since
<malay>yang</malay> we went to jewel [eh] I think
I haven't checked it out ya
apart from school
ya
(mmhmm)
was it
I feel like that's like a lot of my friendships though like with #irfan# #zahidah#
like all my close friends I only like <malay>keluar</malay> with the for like
once every
twice a month or something
like <malay>satu bulan</malay> [eh] no <malay>dua bulan sekali</malay> kind of thing you know
or like <malay>tiga bulan sekali</malay>
!huh!
[oh] [ah]
like two to three months
ya
by who
blanks
[ah] ya ya ya <malay>apa</malay>
give it a listen <malay>nanti lepas ni</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
yes
I think the korean industry is kind of like <malay>macam</malay>
like it's quite
<malay>apa nama dia macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh]
like hats off to them [lah]
cause I watch like the it's okay to not be okay [kan]
like
there's a castle in the
series in the series
and
my sister told me that it's
it's a set
and it's damn big it's like <malay>besar gila</malay> and
it looks very
real [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
you know some some sets you know that it's a set [kan]
like you can know that
I I I haven't watched so I wouldn't know but ya like
it looked
like a legit castle
and I think
it's really
(err)
it's really
[oh] my god (uh) I cannot (uh) my brain is like fried it's really impressive [lah]
but then again they've been like
they're they're quite big [lah] in the industry so
it's not really surprising I guess
that's why I like
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
I've never
heard of him though what's his name
I shall look him up
(mm)
(mm)
ya ya
okay let's talk about
let's follow the prompts [lah] [hor]
let's talk over the worst
is it is it the worst
one for one
[eh] buy one get one free thing yes
okay you want to start first
(mmhmm)
ya ya
makes sense food
[ah] !aiya! okay
so you know the one of the specs that I
<malay>pakai yang</malay> the one that I told you about <malay>hari tu</malay> that it <malay>karat</malay>
so the reason why it's
four hundred okay so it's four hundred plus for two specs [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> it's like one for one
and then
(um) when I was buying it I was like thinking <malay>kenapa dia punya</malay>
<malay>kenapa orang nak kena ada</malay> promotion for specs one for one like who would buy
one for one specs [lah] like at at that point of time I was like thinking
[oh] it's a good deal cause like <malay>macam</malay>
you can buy one for yourself and then the other one you can
like someone can just get it for free [lah] for free
which is technically not free cause like
four hundred for a pair of glasses is really ridiculous
ya
so (um)
this was like a discussion between me and my family like after that heated
(err)
exchange not really heated exchange it was just him telling us that
he cannot do anything about it because of the sweat
but it was a heated argument [eh] discussion between me and my
mum and my <malay>kakak</malay> [ah]
like we were like
<malay>patutlah dia jual</malay> one for one
<malay>sebab dia punya</malay> specs <malay>tak guna</malay>
like
then I was like <malay>lepas tu dia cakap</malay> [eh] cause like
it doesn't makes sense for someone
for you to like get a one for one glasses
like normally people will just like have one
like if if they have another one it's just for
I don't know at home
do people do that wear different glasses at home
my sister does that [lah] but
but like
the reason why you change your glasses is because
your degree <malay>naik</malay> or something right
I don't know
is it just <malay>tak masuk akal</malay> to me
and
it all
like
ya
<malay>macam</malay>
I'm doing like a lot of like
hand gestures [pe] ya like
who one for one
but I think like owndays
(err)
if you see [ah] the people who who buy glasses from owndays [kan] they also keep on changing their glasses
then my <malay>kakak</malay> cause my <malay>kakak</malay> was telling me [ah] that (um) celebrities who
share that <malay>dia orang beli</malay> their glasses from owndays like they keep on <malay>macam</malay> promoting owndays that means like
the quality is still like
not that good for them to keep on changing
but it I don't know maybe it's a paid sponsorship or what
but ya
owndays started the whole like
you can try off the shelves kind of thing and I guess that's why <malay>macam</malay> a lot of
glasses (um) spectacle shops are following following it [lah]
but to compromise the quality though and for the price
I think it's not worth it
buy one
ya cause before that [kan] usually [ah] specs
specs shop is <malay>dekat dalam</malay> the display then you have to like engage the
engage a staff then they will open for you then they will take out
then you try on
but when this is like you just like
is on display everything at <malay>macam</malay> the racks then you just take and <malay>tak payah</malay>
<malay>tak payah apa nama dia</malay>
human interaction
like lesser human interaction
ya
like the the shop that I went to <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia dia dia dia</malay> I sound like I'm singing [oh] my god
there they like
prepare a box where like you can put
to
like you can put after you try [lah] so that they can sanitise [kan]
and then
while waiting for them to fix my <malay>kakak punya</malay> glasses
I was looking at like other customers [ah] and then there's this like two girls who were trying on the glasses
didn't even follow the protocol like they try and then they put back they didn't even put the in the
box thing
and then I was like what
did you not see that box there with a sign that like
you have to put in in there
I don't know [ah]
I feel like a lot of people are not like taking it seriously and it's kind of
worrying
especially like when I see people going out in like
more than five
like <malay>berani gila</malay>
(mmhmm)
[a'ah] ya
ya
ya
that's the thing that my dad say also [ah] the other day
he was like
you know the migrant cases thing
there there there are more cases than they reported because like
the only reason the reason why they
don't really show they don't really report the exact number is because <malay>macam</malay>
to make people feel secured
ya like
because they have to do
they have to
they have to let the migrant workers work <malay>sebab</malay> of the number of attempted suicide cases are rising
ya
then I'm like
I mean I guess that's like
what a lot of countries are doing also [lor] I I mean
I wouldn't know but I suspect
ya
cause like it's all because of
(mm)
ya
[oh] my god
we're not even halfway through
ya
[oh] ya talking about it
ya
talking about <malay>apa nama dia</malay> (um)
wanting to become a journalist right
I was exactly like you [sia] I was like in sec
two or three I think like
during my parents' divorce
I was like [oh] my god I want to like
write
about women empowerment and like
fight for women's right and all that stuff and then I <malay>masuk</malay> then I was like what is all these two faced people
like writing
I feel like writing and radio is very two faced <malay>macam</malay>
because of the
it's it's because of like the nature of it [lah] ya
ya I mean media right like
is meant to be two faced
ya
ya
ya
ya
but I think
like that whole thing
<malay>macam</malay> that
phenomenon started because of
this whole
if you work harder that means you are more hardworking kind of
stereotype [kan]
ya but like that's the sad that's the sad thing [lah] like it's so normalized that like
if you say you're tired
but then you only do a little like <malay>sikit</malay>
as compared to somebody else and then they'll be like !huh! why are you so tired
ya
it's a very asian thing but I don't know about other parts of the world I guess
as long as
capitalism is involved
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
but like playing with stocks are like <malay>macam</malay> gambling [ah]
as in cause you wouldn't know if it's like it's going to
<malay>naik</malay> or <malay>turun</malay>
so you're like
I trust the economy
I'm just going to take out my money before the economy go down
that kind of things
ya
my
my <malay>nenek</malay> sheryl was sharing with me [ah] that like
I should do that when I work I should buy shares and like stuff like that
but I'm like
isn't that gambling
(mm)
ya
I guess it depends
on the individual [lah]
and their self control I guess
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
we literally like move wait what
so
and I think we were not supposed to talk about that
wait wait let me check
!huh!
I mean
hopefully we won't be penalised [lah] cause we were not like
shitting on anything or what it's just like a general discussion
ya
honestly I haven't thought of that before
ya it's something to it's something for me to like look into [lah] to like read and then
I feel like I haven't been reading much I have been on tiktok
for the entire break
so my mind is literally <malay>macam</malay> peanut
it's this small like ya
I can tell from the number of tiktoks you send me
is she on tiktok also
nice
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya
ya
ya
I feel like
and the
like I like tiktok cause there's a lot of content on there
<malay>macam</malay> there's there's there's there's a lot of like useful content and some <malay>merepek</malay> content
but I feel like
it's kind of exhausting
like
like it's getting exhausting [lah] cause like
they keep on
giving you
different (um)
different tiktoks everyday [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like it like within
like if you go on tiktok and then like you accidentally press
the top button like use scroll all the way to the top or like press the top thing
<malay>nanti</malay> it will refresh like and then like you will get like a whole new set of like other stuff
and like it's good because it's giving people it's giving content creators like a platform
and stuff like that and and like to reach out (err) to a bigger audience but <malay>macam</malay>
from the consumer
point of view it's kind of like exhausting that's why I haven't I haven't been on tiktok
for like a while
like I <malay>masuk</malay> also to <malay>tengok</malay> what people
no I <malay>masuk</malay> to <malay>tengok</malay> like people send me
stuff and then I'll be there for like half an hour and then that's all like I I can only like I used to be able to <malay>macam</malay>
scroll for like one two hours now it's just half an hour and I'm done
like it's I mean
that's the thing about the algorithm thing [lah]
like I keep getting the same
type of content
but different no
I showed you about the tinder algorithm
(mmhmm)
!wow!
(uh huh)
maybe that's why you've been seeing #jufri#
no
it's either it's either he's so attractive
or like
I have no idea
(mmhmm)
ya
also cause I go post
followed all your friends
ya
it's like if he if he cannot like get you he will try for your friends kind of thing you know
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
it's so weird
and when guys do that is like <malay>tak ada perempuan lain ke</malay>
like as in <malay>macam</malay>
like to me right it's like <malay>tak tahu malu ke</malay> like you already like cling onto like someone
like a family member and like people know you
and then you start to like
try everyone else <malay>macam</malay>
dude
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[oh] my god
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god
I guess it's his kink or something
like indonesian girls
<malay>macam</malay> like common ya
ya
maybe they have like
an idea of like what
they are <malay>macam</malay>
they going to like serve him or something that's why he wants a maid
!ee! I hate guys like that
(uh huh) like
[ah]
(mmhmm)
!ee!
<malay>suruh dia kahwin</malay> chef [ah]
and and the thing is
each like
<malay>apa nama dia</malay>
there's a lot of like male chefs as compared to female chefs so <malay>kalau dia nak kahwin kahwinlah dengan</malay>
ya
I mean cause it's their passion right that's why they're like a chef in the first place
ya
[ah]
it's it's it's a big kind of
like stay away from me
(mmhmm)
like even if they don't have
even if they don't have like long term <malay>macam</malay> five years or ten years if it's if that's too long for them I feel <malay>macam</malay>
they should have at least like a one year plan <malay>kalau tak macam</malay>
what you <malay>menganggur</malay>
do you not have goals in life
ya that was what like
like a lot of guys I
met before is those like
[oh] I don't know what to do with my life I will think about it [oh] <malay>serahkan pada</malay> like #allah# and that kind of things then I'm like
where's your <malay>usaha</malay> man like you can't just like sit down and expect things to fall down in front of you like you have to work for it
<malay>habis nanti</malay> like if if you say that
if you <malay>tegur</malay> them about it right <malay>nanti dia orang macam</malay>
[oh] or because you are too educated for me and all that kind of stuff like [oh] you're too ya I don't deserve you you don't
I don't deserve you kind of thing then I'm like
like stop putting your insecurities on me like
I shouldn't be like responsible for that [lah] ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
about himself
no [lah] I'm pretty sure you will find someone [lah]
maybe maybe not a #muzmatch# cause like I get it it's so hard to find
it's so hard to find guys who are like who are decent on the app like ya
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god
ya
but that's that's so shallow though
okay I say I say that that's shallow right but I'm guilty of that also
like but but mine is in terms of height
like
did I tell you
did I tell you
the first time <malay>apa</malay> [ah]
when I when I moved to telegram [kan]
[ah] he asked me [lah] [oh] what's your height

he was like I'm one six one
then me

(mmhmm)
[oh] okay

ya I know how it feels
legit
ya
maybe like
other girls
ya other girls did it
ya
[oh] my god it's it's a technique I use to like make myself look smaller
but mine isn't bottom up because bottom up will make me look like super tall
so it's just like
like <malay>atas sikit</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> like a higher angle you know
<malay>habis macam ternaik sikit</malay>

I almost I am <malay>macam tak boleh</malay> I cannot embed in this kind of situation because if I'm in this kind of situation I would end up <malay>macam tersentuh</malay> [ah] and then automatically my <malay>air mata</malay> will <malay>mengalir</malay> you know so I was like then I was like quickly (err) (err) <malay>apa tu kasih suap</malay> then after that I just say (uh)
<malay>cik takpe cik saya nak kena keluar sekejap</malay> [lah] so I went out of the room [lah] then when I went out the room
I then I just sat down outside and then I let them have their moment [lah] so they were talking and then the the the father of my friend and the mother came into the room and then they were taking picture and then there were more there was more crying and everything
and then <malay>kau tahu apa</malay> you know my mum's friend (um)
she cannot enter the room you know of my friend ya <malay>kiranya</malay> my my friend <malay>punya</malay> mum
mother [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay> [ah] <malay>tak boleh masuk</malay> you know inside the room because you see [ah]
because <malay>yang sakit tu anak dia</malay> [tau] so <malay>bila</malay> so she is and then she's also <malay>sakit</malay> so when she will feel <malay>sedih</malay> you know she told me personally you know like
she she try not to enter into the room because when she see her son in that condition <malay>dia akan nangis</malay>
ya ya ya
[ah] yes yes yes that like she feel like <malay>macam anak dia akan pergi dulu</malay> you know so there are moments where when I come over to the place
and then <malay>aku dekat dapur</malay> and then the mum would would like tell me [lah] like like you know (err) the mum will cry you know in front of me and then the mum will say (err)
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] (err) <malay>takde orang</malay> [lah] <malay>yang dia kesian</malay> you know <malay>aku punya kawan macam dia</malay> [kan] <malay>sekarang pun yang jaga dia</malay> it's like the father and the maid <malay>apa</malay> the maid is actually supposed to be doing the house chore and on top of that help out mum you know
but but she has an additional job of taking care of my friend [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> so sometimes <malay>bila dia tak mampu</malay> to help out my friends she has to help out the mother first <malay>apa</malay> because the mother is the priority first <malay>apa</malay>
so you know at times <malay>kau orang kunyit dia mulut dia pun aku kenal pun macam minta minta minta nyawa</malay> (err) <malay>dia pun</malay> sometimes will say you know like (err)
<malay>puas hati masukkan</malay> (err) dalam <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>rumah orang-orang tua atau rumah orang sakit</malay>
can you imagine saying that to your to your you know your mother when your mother listens to that you know how how broken she is when when you you talk like that but but <malay>dia yang sakit dia tak fikir perasaan mak dia</malay> so that's why the mother there are a couple of times already [ah] and then the mother the mother say [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
(err) she try to not enter the room [ah] because she will feel extra sensitive because (err) her her parents (err) no my friend's mum is around like seventy plus
and then like the dad also around seventy plus also so they are like <malay>macam golongan</malay> really <malay>yang orang tua</malay> [lah]
so sometimes <malay>bila mak dia nangis aku pun tak tahu macam mana nak</malay> react with <malay>aku dah macam</malay> !huh! <malay>macam mana nak</malay> what am I going to do am I gonna do I need to bring a tissue paper or what and then I just like <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>cik sabar</malay> [lah] <malay>cik cik tahan</malay> [jer] [lah]
but even the the mum also say [lah] <malay>macam</malay> the mum somehow I can feel like the mum <malay>macam</malay> somehow appreciate <malay>aku</malay> [lah] <malay>macam akan cakap apa</malay> like what you tell me like (err)
an outsider wouldn't do this to to this extend to help a person but the mum <malay>macam</malay>
the mum really appreciate <malay>aku</malay> [ah] the mum <malay>macam</malay> sometimes I think the mum <malay>dia tersentuh</malay> [lah] and always look look look
look out on whenever I come come over and everything <malay>sampai dia pun nak masakkan nasi rawon</malay> [ah] <malay>tak silap</malay>
because they <malay>dia dia orang orang boyan</malay> I think <malay>boyan ke jawa</malay> I think (err) <malay>jawa jawa</malay> sorry <malay>dia orang orang jawa</malay>
the parents are <malay>orang jawa</malay> so so so <malay>nasi rawon</malay> is like a big thing [lah] so I didn't come on the day she <malay>masak</malay> cause I was just too tired then I told my my my friend [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>aku tak dapat datang</malay> [ah] <malay>tolong kau hari ini sebab aku penat</malay>
so the then the mum said [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>cik masak</malay> [ah] <malay>hari tu tapi tu</malay> [lah] (err) <malay>anak tak nas nas tak tak dapat datang</malay> I'm like sorry [lah] <malay>cik</malay> K I mean

<malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>nak balik</malay> [kan] in in september and october you know whenever I tell that to my friend

but half of me I tell myself no I cannot I need to do something from us I mean I need to push through my studies ultimately that is my goal you know
I mean after so many years of just <malay>macam</malay> you know you know that what I mean the situation of of what you are right now <malay>macam</malay> you know feeling very lost I mean I was there last time <malay>macam kita</malay> have that conversation with beberly [kan]

(um) you don't worry because you you ask somebody
you know the fact that you are somebody there are a lot of people who come to your aid when you when you need help because you think about it is just <malay>macam</malay>
he always <malay>dia dia selalu ingat yang</malay>
<malay>yang aku</malay> [jer] <malay>seorang yang boleh tolong dia padahal orang lain pun boleh tolong dia</malay>

yup you don't apply in real life situation
that's true actually it's actually quite what I mean the whole thing is quite true you know when it comes to our education system
but <malay>untuk</malay> I <malay>aku rasa macam</malay>
nothing has changed [eh] over the past how many years we've been living in singapore it is still the same concept of education and everything
it's like you know like the survival of the fittest [lah]
(err) the ones <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>macam</malay> study hard apostrophe
will progress <malay>kuat juga</malay> then the ones <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>tak</malay> progress are the ones <malay>yang macam</malay> mediocre
will just fought out in society <malay>aku masih ingat</malay> (err) I remember you know the A three teacher that geography teacher (err) he
ya ya he say (err) work hard or work in mcdonald's
[ah] now when I think about him [ah] when I think about that statement [ah] about what he made at last time [ah] <malay>aku macam</malay> [eh] you mean people who are working in mcdonald's is that bad [ah] you you are that [ah] that
<malay>macam</malay> his statement [ah] <malay>macam ada</malay> sense of <malay>macam</malay> elitism you know <malay>macam macam macam</malay> how our (err) government [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> that kind of it's like the vibe right there the <malay>dia kasih</malay> ya
<malay>macam</malay> very similar to how the government <malay>macam</malay> how the government is like [lah] so <malay>aku fikir</malay> [eh] you mean <malay>apa yang</malay> people who don't do well or people who are just average in society I mean they they they they are not successful <malay>padahal aku rasa orang-orang macam ini</malay> they are more like happy
I mean of course they want more but they are (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> content with what they have so
<malay>betul betul betul</malay>
understood understood understood
[ah]
this is a very interesting topic to talk about okay (err) honestly before I enter with
ya ya it's [ah] we're left with like twenty minutes okay so honestly (um)
K initially (err) this is like my third (err) application to you know [ah] sorry should I should not mention the name [lah]
to but I just mention the name but never mind it's it's a it's a acronym okay so (um) so before I went there in my head I always thought <malay>macam</malay> able to [kan] <malay>aku nak belajar kat sana</malay> then I'm like I I'm like how am I supposed to cope with the system over there and everything
so it was quite apprehensive [lah] in the beginning [lah] or when I went there but after I went there I realize that the system there is very different you know from singapore cause singapore [kan] <malay>pakai</malay> cambridge [kan] and <malay>sana</malay> they have their own system [tau] [ah] for <malay>apa tu macam</malay> for how to grade and grading and everything
and then <malay>kat sana aku perasan</malay> !wah! the they're very smart you know like the malaysian is super smart [eh] we're not talking about the one in you know we're talking about every other parts of the the country you know <malay>macam</malay> ones from #sabah# with the ones from #johor#
the ones from #perak# like <malay>aku dah aku</malay> I was quite shocked you know like my classmates are damn super smart
but <malay>aku</malay> realize about them is what they lack is
(um)
they are they are very (err) examination based <malay>kau faham</malay> [kan] exam yes book smart exam examination centered
so it's like they can they are they are hardcore memorizer you know their mark their marking style is <malay>macam</malay> hardcore memorizer
and of course the system over there is <malay>macam</malay> (err) the examination is (err) it's it's it's it's very straightforward [ah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) you the question is there you just vomit out back that's how you score but then like if you wanna talk about like (err) those <malay>yang macam</malay> (err) critical thinker
is <malay>tak banyak</malay> [tau] <malay>kat sana</malay>
the ones <malay>yang</malay> critical thinker is surprisingly is the ones <malay>yang</malay> from singapore people like me and my class and my other class and my other classmates so we would tend to ask question <malay>yang macam</malay> critic <malay>yang macam</malay> higher thinking [ah]
but because our our education system is <malay>dah macam</malay> nurture us like this [kan] but <malay>bila</malay> when we go there <malay>dia orang</malay> think <malay>yang kita ni</malay> super on [tau]
so <malay>aku macam</malay> !huh! super on [eh] not really [leh] it's just that (uh) our just that our culture <malay>macam</malay> singapore culture has trained us to be like this <malay>macam</malay> and then some more you have to understand <malay>aku kat sana aku</malay> pay <malay>enam ribu</malay> [eh]
almost to like a nine K [eh] (err) nine K of (err) school fees they are only paying one K of school fees
so every hour and every minute <malay>tu bagi aku</malay> is <malay>duit</malay> so if I don't ask the question am I not wasting my money and my dad's money
ya so so that's why that's why I feel like <malay>macam</malay> when [ah] so sometimes they they the malaysian <malay>kat sana pun bila dia orang tengok aku pun dia orang macam</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> they are quite intimidated [lah] even my classmate also told me [ah] <malay>yang</malay> the very first time they met me they she feels that I am <malay>aku sombong aku</malay> arrogant <malay>aku cakap</malay> [eh] serious [ah]
she say [ah] <malay>engkau macam poyo</malay> [ah] <malay>aku dah</malay> serious [ah] <malay>poyo</malay>
[ah] <malay>poyo</malay> then I'm like but but because the way I bring myself with <malay>aku</malay> I'm not the way I bring myself is my my my my like my my <malay>kepala</malay> would be like very up and then I will look at you like bitch I'm judging you that kind but I it's not like it's not like that it's just that I have to
put up a very hard exterior [lah] because you are overseas [mah] you're like you need to hustle <malay>apa</malay> and then then
when it comes to studies wise (err)
#alhamdulillah# I would say that I am coping very well [lah] I mean during the first semester I got three point seven for my but it's during my second semester that <malay>aku</malay> drop really really bad because first I was very complacent second (um)
I the the one thing that I didn't do quite smart what I mean at the one thing that is stupid of me was I shared my own answer script
to my classmate
and then it got shared with other people you know
so can you imagine I was the one who did everything from scratch and then it got shared so I told myself (err) then I was not really focused [ah] like I still remember like the day before the exam <malay>baru aku nak belajar</malay> can you imagine
but I I had a very long months of preparing but but because of (err) I was like I don't know it's I just I just got so complacent in my head
ya <malay>yang</malay> answer script
[ah]
[ah] it's like a <malay>macam</malay> (err) I based (err) meaning [ah] I I will use the past year exam paper then I will answer the question then most of the time the the questions will will be almost the same [ah] like every four years is almost the same that's what my one of my friends told me [lah] [ah] who has studied in
so and then I saw in (err) semester three I told myself no I cannot
(um) [ah] in semester three I was very low key <malay>nak mampus</malay> [tau] <malay>aku macam aku</malay> every question every every essay that I did I didn't really share with anyone I just kept quiet (uh) I even like (um) <malay>tak</malay> post anything about about me are preparing for exams I just was just very very low key [ah]
and then my my results was #alhamdulillah# I mean I I was quite surprised [ah] that I got three point nine which is the highest I have ever gotten [lah]
ya and then this coming semester four <malay>pun</malay> (err) <malay>aku</malay> hopefully [lah] I can get a (err) very good [lah] but all in all <malay>aku cakap dengan kau</malay> I mean
I don't know I don't know [lah] <malay>macam</malay> but but you see [ah] I I remember that time [ah] <malay>aku baru balik dari</malay> #kedah# [tau] <malay>nak balik</malay> (err) <malay>pergi</malay> <malay>tak silap</malay> <malay>ke</malay> singapore (uh)
and then (err) I remember sitting with this (err) with this lady [lah] she is (err) from #penang# you know she no no I I I went #penang# sorry ya I went #penang# and then I was on my way back from #penang# to singapore via flight so there was this (err) lady that I I sat beside and then (err)
when I because I was sitting at the window seat right so when I say (err) excuse me (err) then (err) then so when I enter (err) and sit and when I seated here now
you know she automatically she ask me [eh] you singaporean [ah]
then <malay>aku dah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mana kau tahu</malay> then she say [oh] I know [lah] because of your accent and the way you talk
<malay>aku dah</malay> !wow! I'm shocked man
ya you can tell [ah] you can tell from a from a
talk <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
yes it's it's different and then (um) then she was asking she was telling me [lah]
[eh] (err) you she she's a teacher in a she is she is a graduate from singapore [eh] <malay>tak silap aku</malay> [eh] no no no (err) no she's a she's a alumni of
but her brother actually (err) studies in and (err) did (err) did her his master in something like that then the brother got married to a singaporean girl (err) so to cut the story short <malay>dia cakap dengan aku</malay> [lah] [eh] (uh) you [kan] <malay>orang melayu kenapa</malay> you <malay>tak</malay> stay <malay>kat</malay> malaysia (err) I think you should
(err) take this opportunity to work in malaysia I think you would try you will thrive very well in malaysia then you got me thinking [eh] <malay>apa dia cakap tu</malay> maybe there is a certain truth you know because <malay>kat sana aku perasan orang melayu</malay> !wah! babe privilege babe
<malay>macam</malay> privileged <malay>gila</malay> <malay>aku cakap</malay> privileged you know
yes yes yes exact <malay>bumiputera</malay> thing
yes yes <malay>betul betul betul</malay> then <malay>aku cakap</malay> [lah] [eh] but you know it's not that hard it's not that easy you know cause I am a singaporean malay then (err) <malay>aku cakap dengan dia</malay> [lah] I was very frank with her I told her (err) you know how <malay>kat sini kita</malay>
(err) <malay>macam</malay> casing <malay>kita punya bangsa</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tindaskan</malay>
(err) or we are being like extra [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay> not extra [lah] we're just being (err) we are we we we're looked down
<malay>tapi kat sana</malay> it's (err) it's <malay>bangsa dia orang yang</malay> look down <malay>kau faham</malay> [kan] so <malay>dia macam terbalik</malay> (err) <malay>macam dia</malay> (err) <malay>aku cakap dengan</malay> very frank [ah] then <malay>dia cakap</malay> ya I <malay>faham</malay> I <malay>faham tapi tapi aku rasa sana pun dia dia rakyat</malay> is not
(err) every everyone is kind of like taken care of [lah] I would say I mean I do not know I mean I I I've been staying there for like almost (err) three three three years plus now (err) it's good ya it and (err) I find that
I mean is a very hustle and bustle city [lah] but the expenses there is <malay>mahal nak mampus</malay>
I find like <malay>macam barang-barang dah macam barang-barang</malay> the shampoo body shower [oh] !wah! I tell you <malay>mahal sangat macam satu</malay>
one body shower <malay>macam</malay> dove [eh] twenty four #ringgit# [eh] !siala! twenty four #ringgit# when you pay when you pay fifty #ringgit# to pay for the twenty four #ringgit# and when you left with that balance [eh] <malay>macam kiwak macam</malay> [eh] this is very expensive [leh] but when in singapore
when you pay fifty dollars for the same amount of eight dollars you you have the balance is still a lot [kan] then it's like worth it [kan] <malay>padahal</malay> it's the same current it's the same rate but just different currency so honestly if you ask me whether
I want to stay in malaysia or not I tell you

I I see myself writing for a article in a journal you know I mean it's it's an academic journal so and the (um) I mean that's that's the thing that <malay>aku aku</malay> don't mind doing [lah] but for me to do that is like I need to go into the academic
<malay>punya</malay> sector like to become I'm not necessarily become a lecturer but maybe (err)
(err) take my master and maybe I don't know take my in language and because at the end of the day (err) in language <malay>pun tak banyak orang yang ambil apa</malay> unless you are really passionate and interested in it [lah]

it's a unique course I would say
a <malay>pasal</malay> like
coding <malay>dengan</malay> design <malay>macam tak banyak orang tahu buat</malay> so
ya and (err) this course is like it appeals to me [lah] because I also I really love designing ya and the coding coding element is also like quite interesting so and I
feel like it might help me in the future when I look out for jobs cause now <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>banyak benda</malay> is like about technology [kan] so ya I feel like this course (uh) actually benefit me [lah] in the future
(mm)

<malay>apa</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
!wah!
I can't I can't imagine myself in that situation <malay>macam nanti</malay>if if I were to be in that situation confirm I I would panic
so <malay>susah tak macam kerja</malay> like in a like a team
like during that that test
[oh] right
(mm)
[oh]
that's that's interesting I think you will do very well [lah]
yeah
don't worry I think with all the skills you are equipped with confirm you
<malay>boleh boleh buat kerja</malay>
then (uh) (uh) besides <malay>sekolah</malay> [kan] like what what do you like to do <malay>macam</malay> do you have <malay>macam</malay> other hobby <malay>ke</malay> or <malay>apa apa benda</malay> [lah]
[ah]
(mm)
ya I I know how you feel like during secondary school <malay>pastu ada apa</malay> O level <malay>abeh</malay> stress <malay>takle fikir</malay> yeah
[oh] during my free time I <malay>suka</malay>
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> (uh) draw I also like to (err) <malay>tengok apa ni</malay>
[ah] anime ya that's my favourite but I haven't really been doing so because <malay>takde</malay> time [kan] poly <malay>dalam</malay> I'm in a design course so I don't really have much time to (uh) do my hobbies which is kind of (uh) <malay>macam sedih</malay> but yeah so
now that I'm having my semester break I can finally (uh) do (uh) my hobbies
yeah
yep
actually <malay>ada banyak</malay> plan but like the thing is that I just like I'm just I'm too scared to
go for the trials (err) because I (um) I'm actually afraid of rejection
but (um) I'll probably you know I just want to like build up confidence in myself first then (um) maybe in (uh) (um) year two then I will start <malay>macam</malay> join like start trying out for [ah] I've actually picked
<malay>macam</malay> a few is (err) firstly is [ah] floorball like (um) <malay>aku kata tadi</malay> [kan] as I've mentioned (uh) floorball and then second was silat
and then third is <malay>dikir barat</malay> ya but
I I'm actually having a hard time trying to decide which I wanna join so what do you think
yeah
true
who knows
ya it is it is that's why <malay>macam</malay> I'm like a bit <malay>takut</malay> to (um) you know join their team because (err) <malay>macam dorang nya</malay> expectations like a bit high you know so I'm I'm I'm afraid like tak boleh meet <malay>dorang nya</malay> expectations
yes I have like a few months to think about it so ya then (um) so okay we talking about poly and stuff so like today what did you do today
!wah! how was it
but I think right I think confirm <malay>boleh</malay> pass <malay>punya</malay> confirm
yeah
[oh] for what
[oh] <malay>mesti sakit</malay> [eh]
<malay>apa tu</malay>
[oh]
(mm)
<malay>banyak</malay>
[ah]
yeah
(mm)
then the the surgery <malay>bila</malay>
[oh]
!wow!
ya man I can't imagine myself
!wah! all the best for that for that surgery you you will get through it
it's okay it my my my mum my mum has been through the same thing then <malay>dia</malay> <malay>dia kata</malay> like
(um) it's actually not that painful [lah] because like you know they put you in (uh) on sleep right so like you won't feel anything like you only feel it like once you <malay>bangun</malay> so I don't think it's that bad ya so you don't have to worry you know
and anyways it's for the better also so I think [ah] after if I think it's better to get like the surgery done like as soon as possible because you know you <malay>tak nak</malay> any <malay>macam</malay> side effects [kan] so ya
then
(uh) other than
then right you you said that you had your I mean you're gonna have like a surgery right
so (uh) how
how how how would you feel like <malay>macam</malay> you know before you enter the the room like what do you think like <malay>macam</malay> like your feeling
[oh]
yeah
(uh) I've never I've never <malay>apa ni</malay> had any surgeries before
I
I can't imagine the <malay>macam dia nya</malay> sakit
[eh] then [oh]
[eh] you go first
ya
yeah
yeah
[ah] small business
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] I never say
no no no you you meant [ah] calligraphy is it
[oh] yeah yeah
ya ya ya so <malay>macam</malay> during my free time cause [ah]
<malay>apa ni</malay> I I love doing calligraphy right so I like <malay>macam</malay> I have I have like a mini business where
I (uh) <malay>buat</malay> calligraphy on <malay>orang punya macam</malay> notebooks and stuff then I sell it for like (um) quite a reasonable price [lah] so it's affordable to everyone and I also like playing with colours and
(uh) I like !aiya! basically like (um) doing calligraphy calligraphy so ya that's why I decided to <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>buat</malay> this business because
cause a lot of people [kan] you know singaporeans [kan] <malay>diorang suka macam</malay> study [kan] then <malay>banyak orang suka buat macam</malay> notebook <malay>diorang macam cantik cantik</malay> so yeah that's why I I thought like why not you know just like
decorate their their notebooks and stuff so that <malay>diorang ada macam</malay> motivation to <malay>belajar</malay>
yeah [eh]
[kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> COVID [kan] so like (uh) <malay>kat dalam rumah</malay> what do you do
(mmhmm)
ih
(oo)
!wah! !wah! tell me more
ya ya is good because like you know now COVID like a lot of like businesses are like affected right so I think this online business thing is also <malay>macam</malay> a good way [lah] for <malay>orang</malay> to you know <malay>macam</malay> get that extra cash
then like after after <malay>macam</malay> COVID [kan]
you where's where's the first place <malay>yang</malay> you want to travel
yup
list them all
[oh]
[oh]
ya ya Gold Coast was very fun the beach was very memorable also
and remember <malay>yang kita semua jatuh sakit</malay> after we played at the beach
true
ya
it was actually quite funny because like everyone who swam at the the beach <malay>semua kena apa ni jatuh sakit</malay>
yeah hopefully once like <malay>macam</malay> the border [dah] <malay>buka</malay> then we can go
ya
ya true true
!wah! for me right
after <malay>macam</malay> this COVID situation I think the first place I want to travel to is (uh) <malay>mana ni</malay> Japan
yes
I've been there <malay>bila</malay> when I was like I think five years old
I was very young so <malay>macam tak ingat</malay> (uh) I don't really remember a lot of things ya so that's why I wanna <malay>macam</malay> go there again and then <malay>macam</malay> like immerse in the culture and stuff
ya I I mean Japan also <malay>macam</malay> if it's like an interesting country [ah] <malay>macam menarik</malay> you know <malay>pasal</malay>
like because (uh) I told you before I'm an anime lover right so like I want to go there <malay>macam</malay> collect <malay>diorang nya apa ni</malay> figurine because like <malay>banyak orang kata macam</malay>
is <malay>macam</malay> quite cheap [ah] so I was like okay [ah] then I I think if if cause I like to collect
figurine so I was like you know why not just go japan and then like buy more figurines
yeah
!wah! I tell you I'm biggest procrastinator [eh] with the biggest of the biggest procrastinator I I like let's say like
the the work is <malay>macam</malay> due next week [kan] then I would only do it like <malay>macam tiga hari</malay> before the the due date
ya because I don't know sometimes I'm just too <malay>macam penat nak buat buat</malay> the assignment so that's why I keep you know pushing back the assignment ya what about you
[oh]
(mm)
ya (uh) me also like most of the time is always like cause I
always use my I'm on my handphone <malay>asyik tengok</malay> Instagram <malay>semua</malay> then it's like I don't realize like the time has passed and then when it's like already ten o'clock I'm like [oh] [dah] <malay>lambat</malay> [ah] just <malay>tidur</malay> [lah] <malay>besok boleh buat</malay>
the homework ya that's like the biggest problem I face since secondary school
it's it's hard to overcome procrastination
yeah
(uh) it can be done but it's just very hard
<malay>macam</malay> like group projects [eh]
[oh] recently I I <malay>ada macam</malay> this one (err) group project like I just finished <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>dua</malay> weeks <malay>lepas</malay> is <malay>apa</malay> it's called studio project so it's basically like because (uh)
my course is interaction design [kan] so we do we have to like be in a group and then we have to brainstorm (uh) ideas together and then come up with like (uh) a story
so with this story we have to like make it as interesting [lah] because interaction design is all about user experience how to you know
(uh) how to attract users so that they they like like our product and stuff
so my group <malay>kita buat</malay> we did this (uh) <malay>macam</malay> is like a E storybook kind of thing and then we drew our own characters and <malay>macam</malay> the setting all also we we draw ourselves using Photoshop Photoshop is is a very <malay>susah</malay> app
to <malay>pakai</malay> because ya it's only my first year and then is also my <malay>macam</malay> my first time [ah] <malay>pakai</malay> then it's like <malay>susah</malay> [ah] then like all my other friends <malay>macam</malay> they are like quite experienced in it because some of them are from ya
so so for the past two weeks we've been trying to make the story <malay>macam</malay> interesting [ah] so like when users (uh) see the story then they can like
interact with the the book by clicking like <malay>macam</malay> arrows and it will lead them to it will lead them to like the next (uh) page or something so that's like <malay>macam</malay> there's an interaction there
ya that's about it
for you [eh]
(mm)
why kay you tell me
how #rabak#
!wah! I legit also don't like this type of people [leh] like they really make my blood go up [eh] like like they already like I mean when we assign them task already right then after that they don't want to do their own work then after that like we we
have to [ah] take their workload and then after that do their own
work which is like I feel like it's not fair then at the end of the day they they probably will also get the same mark as us and it's like not fair but that's how poly works [lah]
(mm)
[oh]
[oh] I know what you mean
hanoi
that's good ya
ya
[oh]
[oh] that's interesting
[ah] ya ya
(mm)
[oh] that's good that's good
yeah
[oh]
ya
I think I think it's a it's a good app [ah] because in
like this should be you know we should raise
more awareness in our Singaporean society cause like I feel like not many people you know know about these things so it it's a good (um) for me I think your app is very beneficial [lah] for people yeah
(oo) that's good
ya ya ya very interesting [eh]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
yeah I've heard of Fun Run before I actually played that game
!wah!
that's cool
Animal Crossing is a very in game now [eh] a lot of people have been playing it I'm also very curious <malay>macam banyak orang</malay> like <malay>semua main</malay> [ah] then I was I'm also like quite interested to know like what's so you know special about this game
(mm)
!wah!
ya ya ya very interesting
<malay>macam</malay> look forward to [ah]
!wah! that that's quite a handful you got you got <malay>banyak</malay> project to <malay>apa ni buat</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
yeah it's good also because like [kan] year three we <malay>ada</malay> internship right I and I also heard like before you start your internship you have to actually go for an interview for (um) <malay>untuk</malay> like the company before <malay>diorang</malay> accept you in
I I actually I didn't know that like I thought internship like <malay>diorang</malay> we're just like straight away <malay>masukkan</malay> you inside there but I didn't know like you have to <malay>macam</malay> go through an interview so I think <malay>macam</malay> it's quite it's quite beneficial [lah] like <malay>apa diorang</malay>
<malay>ajar</malay> teach <malay>kat dalam</malay> yeah
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya ya
(mm)
I also had like a similar a similar module I did <malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) previously
where also same it's called (uh) effective effective (err) communication skill so <malay>diorang ajar macam mana</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> you know (err) if (err) communicate effectively and how to like you know gain (uh) confidence
and what are some of the
the like
powerful words I guess you can use during your interview so like to <malay>macam macam</malay> you like sell yourself so
ya I I actually find that module actually quite interesting [ah] but <malay>macam sedih</malay> [ah] because like it was only for a semester I wish it was longer because it really it really helped me [ah] from someone who is actually <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam takut</malay> to like you know stand in like to talk during a presentation to someone I am now who (err) is (uh) confident enough [ah] to present and actually ya it has really helped me in my presentation
[oh] ya
ya
!wah! actually I make friends very instantly [eh] it's like ya because (err) okay the good thing about technology is that (err)
like you you can connect easily with people so like there's this app called Telegram so they had this channel for my school [lah] so anyone who goes to the school they can just join this channel and then after that they will start talking to one another
and <malay>macam</malay> it's like quite cool [lah] because like then you can <malay>macam cari orang</malay> in the same course as you then after that you can make friends from there like for me (err) there's this <malay>macam ada</malay> this (uh) girl that she came up I mean she texted me then she was like [eh] I heard you're in the in the same course
then (uh) she's like (uh) let's be friends [ah] then from there (uh) we started being friends [ah] then (err) when during poly because (err) mostly it was on Zoom right because of <malay>macam</malay> this COVID situation <malay>semua</malay> so everything <malay>macam</malay> is online
ya so it's also good like easier to communicate online
ya so (err) ya then (err) in school like when we <malay>macam jumpa</malay>
face to face it was actually not bad ya we we we we acted like we we've known each other for <malay>macam</malay> many years
ya so it was like quite easy [lah] in terms of like making new friends yeah but I think now the only thing <malay>macam susah</malay> is that (uh) is like the modules [ah] because ya I mean like some of the modules it's like I've never <malay>macam</malay> done before
or I have no interest in and then ya like for example coding I've never done <malay>tak pernah buat</malay> coding before so yeah I I get to learn like new things and stuff
ya
you [eh] what about you
ya
ya from secondary school then to poly
!wah! my one don't have [eh] cause COVID then no orientation very damn sad [leh]
I was going to cry you know cause no orientation then you know my school got this like <malay>macam</malay> party for the for the freshman then don't have cause COVID
[oh]
!huh! really [ah]
[oh]
[oh] I see I see
[oh] I think I think flag day is not bad to be honest it's it's just the the weather that is like you know kind of makes everything <malay>macam</malay>
[oh]
(mm)
I I think not bad [leh] the one that there was one time
I also did flag day it was eight hours it was very hot yes it was eight hours because last time (um) my I had I had this (uh) program called like so basically like you have to do like volunteer jobs and then you have to like count in the hours [lah] then you will get the
<malay>macam</malay> the badge <malay>gitu</malay> so yeah so I went for the eight hours shift [one] [ah] so it's not bad [ah] <malay>tapi panas gila</malay>
it was so hot
and the and the worst thing [kan] towards the is <malay>tengah puasa</malay> you know <malay>tengah puasa</malay> then like me and my friend <malay>macam</malay> like [eh] <malay>nak batal ke nak nak batal ke tak nak batal ke tak</malay>
then we then <malay>kita</malay> almost <malay>batal</malay> [lah] my then my friend [dah] <malay>tak boleh</malay> take it [kan] then she was like [ah] <malay>batal</malay> [jer] [lah]
ya
eight hours was (uh) painful [lah] then <malay>kita jalan jalan</malay>
ya we we we we walked around the whole of #Tampines# ya but it was very very rewarding <malay>pasal</malay> (uh) at the end of the day <malay>kita dapat banyak</malay> donation
ya
(mm)
!huh! <malay>biar betul</malay>
right
!wah!
kay [lah] not bad you know at least you all <malay>macam</malay> you know like put money inside [lah] donate also
ya
but if you were to do <malay>macam</malay> flag day again would you do it
really ya it is
[oh] ya ya I've done the morning shift [one] before it's very very tiring
<malay>penat</malay> I couldn't <malay>macam buka my mata</malay>
ya it was during <malay>bulan puasa</malay>
ya
ya cause we had to stay under the sun because like a lot of the <malay>macam</malay> the <malay>tempat yang ada</malay> shade [kan] already [dah] <malay>ada orang</malay> so me and my friend like <malay>macam terpaksa</malay> [ah] <malay>kita stand</malay>
under the hot sun then collect [lor] but that spot was the best cause <malay>banyak orang lalu sana</malay> so ya so we got a lot of donations there then after that we told our other friends then they start coming then after that we were like !alamak! shouldn't have told them
[oh] maybe in the future maybe they have more fun orientation we don't know
ya ya ya
ya ya my school my school my school got night party but too bad [lah] this COVID there [ah] spoil all the plan [eh] then like legit man then [ah] spoil then like I can't even like
like meet my friends right regularly in school have to do Zoom Zoom is also very hard you know it's hard to concentrate but the good thing is like can wake up late
ya true hopefully [lah] I I I really wish <malay>macam</malay> this COVID situation will <malay>macam</malay> die down [ah] because it really affects [ah] <malay>kita punya</malay> life
(mm)
ya thanks for the talk it was was good nice meeting you

okay
[a'ah] so <malay>kita kena bual bual macam untuk satu jam kena cakap</malay> like in both like <malay>melayu dengan</malay> english so <malay>boleh tak</malay>

wait like <malay>buta</malay> like like how <malay>buta hati atau</malay> like you know
like [ah] okay
[oh]
wait cause the the guy was the cause of like <malay>kenapa dia buta</malay>
<malay>tak senonoh</malay> then after that
[ah]
wait <malay>tapi</malay> the guy know <malay>yang</malay> like like
the guy is <malay>dia apa tu yang punca yang</malay> the girl <malay>punya</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
[ah] [oh]
!wah!
but then how [ah] like
<malay>lelaki tu</malay> !wah!
ya
why so weird
<malay>memang macam</malay> like I don't know like cannot like straightforward you know
ya [lah] but like <malay>macam</malay> it's so coincidental you know like <malay>macam</malay> the girl <malay>dengan</malay> the guy is like
you know always meeting is it like fate but I know that's what korean drama always like
[oh]
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
<malay>kedai</malay> ya
what
but <malay>macam</malay> it doesn't make sense like
ya ya I think <malay>kena tengok</malay> right
but that's really your favourite movie
your <malay>abang</malay> is my <malay>adik</malay>
!wah!
(err)
okay okay actually like
nah I like to watch a lot of show [oh] then [ah] my favourite show is like the big bang theory I don't know whether you heard of it ya netflix but then
I think it's kind of <malay>takde lagi</malay> is it
<malay>pasal dia</malay> ya <malay>dia orang dah</malay> remove then it's the show's about you now like scientist like geeks
and then like they they are very awkward with like <malay>perempuan</malay> you know like the girls and then like [eh] like <malay>macam</malay> like when I watch it I was like [oh] my god that's like so me you know like I like to like you know (uh) <malay>macam baca buku</malay> all that thing and then like won't interact with other people then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like
(um) they suddenly
(um)
how to say like they get they become less awkward over the seasons
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> he I think <malay>dia orang ada</malay> like <malay>sepuluh</malay> seasons and then like it's all started off when they were still like young like I think like twenty years old and all that <malay>lepas tu dia orang dah besar sampai</malay> like <malay>dia orang</malay> like <malay>tiga puluh lebih</malay> and until like
all of them I think almost all of them get married
and then it's like I think is it is interesting because like you actually you watch the seasons like you actually like following their life and like you know like you <malay>tengok</malay> like <malay>macam dia orang</malay> like grow to become like a better person
so <malay>macam</malay> damn cool because I also because like <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam banyak orang ingatkan</malay> like <malay>orang yang suka</malay> science <malay>semua ni dia orang semua macam apa tu ganjil</malay> like very awkward right like they feel like they <malay>macam</malay> cannot fit into the society
ya
socially less awkward and also because like <malay>macam</malay> if you realize it's also about our life where like when you are younger you tend to feel like you cannot fit in but you don't need to change for anyone
[kan] like it's like sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that who like who you are
as a person doesn't affect like what people think of you or what people perceive of you
because like I remember one episode [kan] like <malay>macam</malay> young sheldon is like the most awkward there's this guy <malay>nama</malay> sheldon
but he's like super smart like super genius and like when he when he was still young [lah] so the thing is like he's (err) like professor in this like
school like not really a professor [lah] by research scientists and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like (um) <malay>banyak orang ingatkan dia macam tak boleh</malay> fit in
but then over the years <malay>apa dia dia dia cuba</malay> like fit in to like parties <malay>macam</malay> because <malay>ada seorang perempuan</malay> popular <malay>ni</malay> neighbour <malay>dia</malay>
[kan] and then like (um) <malay>dia</malay> like invited them like this clique of like nerds to like the party then <malay>lepas tu</malay> they will they will feeling very awkward because <malay>dia orang dia orang</malay> like <malay>cuba</malay> to interact with like the rest
ya <malay>dia orang semua ingatkan dia</malay> weird <malay>sebab</malay> like <malay>dia datang pun</malay> like <malay>dengan baju tak senonoh</malay>
until the party and cannot fit in [lah] but then <malay>lepas tu</malay> then he realise that [oh] my god
like (um) over the years [kan] they create their own party with their own like so called clique and like all the cool people come in like the movie star like [ah] people who are like basically like
<malay>apa tu daripada dia ni kecil sebab dia ada tengok</malay> show <malay>ni daripada kecil</malay> call doctor something so it's like a show about like doing experiment like science fair then that guy become like movie star or something like that
and that guy actually come to her his party instead
so like he was saying like
but then he realise that like people will love him for him
not because like he have to change for people to love him
ya so it's quite a good show like and that's not the only thing [lah] because like <malay>dia dia dia pun</malay> like was single all the way then <malay>lepas tu dia orang ingatkan takkan</malay> [ah] <malay>kahwin</malay> then ya because a lot of people think he's weird then <malay>tak</malay> he still have friends but then he realise that
he realise that (um) <malay>apa tu</malay> to like
he in the end find out that there's someone that is just like him that he can click with ya so then it is this person is called amy which is like he's she's even awkward
like more awkward than him and then like they met [ah] through like this like you know for us it's like tinder and all that but when they were filming the show no tinder or this is starting it's just currently like quite new so like they put them in the show then it shows that you know you can actually meet anyone from any like anywhere
like you don't have to like meet someone from your group of friends or what like anybody can be suited for you so they work things out like I think for four years they didn't even touch each other
ya because sheldon is weird
like it's very awkward all the way but then they realised that sometimes right in relationship or in life you have to compromise <malay>betul tak</malay> like he cannot like
(um) you know like straightaway
like realise [eh] tomorrow you gonna get married this person
ya so they actually show us <malay>yang macam</malay> love
have to be built upon it like it cannot like
<malay>terus</malay> jump to it
so same as like there's another example where like there's two another couple where they get married
like
without thinking
it compared to like them right so it's like a contrast [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> carry <malay>macam</malay> opposite of each other
ya so <malay>dia orang</malay> cuddle cuddle <malay>dia macam</malay> like [eh] let's get married today you know
and like and then like there's also another couple there then they always have like intimacy <malay>macam dia orang selalu buat benda tu</malay> then like
then it it just shows that there's different type of people in this world [lor]
so but both relationship works out in the end they are both happy you know so that's a good thing [lah] that's why I love that show because it shows the true
like meaning of life like the true perception of life ya
cool [kan] I feel like it's damn cool ya
ya I know because like all the korean craze japanese craze or the circuit breaker [lah] don't know why
then look at you now look at you now look at me
then ya like all of you are addicted except for me
so weird it's like you start small then it's like big now
ya
why they had never cared
[oh] because you <malay>pakai</malay> like all the <malay>duit</malay> birthday for all this
[oh]
[oh] ya you told me [what]
[oh] ya ya the cafe thing then
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya
I know you said you show me the photos [mah] and then <malay>macam</malay> it's damn nice [what]
[oh]
!wah!
#oma# spoon okay
ya I I know what you mean is the the drawing right
ya it's latte art ya
ya but
no [lah] but waffle [kan] <malay>macam murah takkan</malay> they will charge you [lah]
okay but #haji# lane is overpriced <malay>sebab tu</malay> [lah] you cannot compare
ya seven dollar is is actually <malay>murah</malay> ya but it's at where somerset
farrer park ya but the thing is
that means like <malay>macam kalau</malay> they are not like at the central area of singapore [kan] it's usually cheaper
very circular
ya [lah] that's why it's cheaper [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> if it if it's at town right confirm <malay>mahal</malay>
actually ya
(uh huh)
what no [lah] but <malay>tu untuk buka</malay> like cafe in singapore quite
like tough [what]
so you become like <malay>ibu</malay>
but you know
design the place itself [kan] <malay>macam</malay> they will just you just need to hire a person to do it then after that you just forget about that person you don't need to be part of the cafe
ya but it's not
it's not it's very <malay>mahal</malay> and like ya
it's like <malay>macam</malay> you know like we we it's like our like previous <malay>kedai</malay> [lor]
ya it's like you need to know <malay>makanan apa sedap</malay> and then like sometimes [kan] you hire the chef and the <malay>dia tak tahu masak</malay>
ya
no but actually <malay>makanan tak sedap pun tak apa</malay> [tau] cause like sometimes some people they just go there ya enjoy the aesthetic and like the ambience
ya the ambience of like the whole cafe and like <malay>macam</malay> it's cool [lah] like
you know like your <malay>makanan</malay> K cause your <malay>makanan tak sedap</malay> [kan] at least your coffee <malay>sedap</malay> or like you get like some unique like latte art like what you say
[eh]
ya
maybe you are just like picky
ya ya [lah] you see I love coffee you know like I can drink like coffee <malay>macam tak ada gula</malay>
ya like <malay>takde gula</malay> is like totally fine with me ya
tea without sugar can but coffee [oh] because of the bitterness [kan]
it's just weird
K [lah] okay so okay so we talk about that then okay
actually I want to ask you [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like K this is a weird question because I just see at the prompts (um) if you have like <malay>tiga</malay> like wish that you wanna wanna
you can fulfil [lah] okay which one you think you would would would it be
like like three wish that you can have
the three wishes
ya like okay like <malay>kalau tak ada macam</malay> K if like there's no boundaries because you know like <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay> aladdin all that right it's like you cannot kill anyone you cannot love and you can't make anyone fall for you or you cannot
make you fall for anyone and then I think I forgot to tell you cannot bring people up raise people out from the date
like you can ya resurrection ya so you can't like make them like
bring them back to life so (um) out of these three [kan] like for me I feel like
let's say like we cannot bring back if you can't bring people back to life okay K that one is out so
you can make people fall for you let's you can they can be part of your three wishes though and then the last one is like you cannot be a you cannot be rich right
okay [lah] have ya it ya you can I think think you cannot like like have money ya
#lee kuan yew# no [ah] is it you can be rich I can't remember
okay let's make it like you cannot be because like you know it'll be more interesting because like you wish for for example like [oh] I wish that I have my own restaurant but it's not monetary like [kan] like <malay>duit apa tu apa tu</malay> it's just ya cause if you just say like I have a million dollar [kan] <malay>tak</malay> fun
because everybody everybody wants that ya everyone's and then if you already have one million dollar like maybe like your three wish like that for me actually my three wish I know [what]
what
okay I think that's a bit far [oh]
okay okay so your wish is to pass A level
okay
what
okay then the other two
okay how about you okay you say your first wish first then I say my first wish K because like I feel like you would are looking more at the short term first right then long term
setting my short term wish now right is
to find
something that I like in life
cause like I feel like I'm <malay>macam sangat</malay> lost
ya because like I don't really know what I want
ya
not purpose I already know what's my purpose in life
(mmhmm)
ya
no because like I think is about in singapore right compared to other countries like in singapore you are spoilt for choice
there's too many like <malay>macam</malay> like direction that you can go like because you imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you stay in malaysia then like ya <malay>tak banyak</malay> ya like I think you will only get like
like [kan] <malay>siapa</malay> like most people will go either retail and then like or office world [lah] because in singapore we <malay>kita kita</malay> believe in like equality right
so like everybody can be whatever they want ya
ya I think it's also because I think we are more advanced
compared to like other other countries [lah] our neighbouring countries [lah]
so ya like you know like
I see like in other countries [lah] if you are rich you will have better opportunities like in singapore [ah] no matter what if you are rich or poor ya it's based on your hard work
ya
so that's why I like I like the so for me <malay>macam</malay> like I'm so spoilt for choice like even after working [kan] like I don't know whether that's the thing that I really want
like you know
even though I know it pays well like <malay>gaji besar</malay> but like you know like we we it's tiring and then like it's <malay>penat</malay> and then like you gonna remember you have to going to spend like maybe like thirty years of your life doing the same thing all over again
ya but the thing is like if even if you want to do something more fun [kan]
like sometimes it's not stable because like you want to start your own family or like
ya so like you have to choose you have to either choose like whether you want like flexibility or you want to choose you want money like like I don't think like you can okay [lah] maybe you <malay>kalau</malay> you start your own business you can be have you can have stability like in the future but at the start <malay>macam betul susah</malay>
ya money is very important now
ya
ya it's zero already ya community case [lah]
ya <malay>bukan</malay> like the
ya
like malaysia
ya
I know what you mean
then
hotspot [lah] hotpot is the food
are you thinking about food right now
railway
what no the whole stretch you mean
national railway railway is [eh] you know the train [one]
[oh] my god
ya
I know the whole railway right
ya but okay [lah] (um)
I think like maybe because they are so used you know back in their country that they are not they don't mind congestion
ya cause you know like if you go #jakarta# like I don't know you wait did go #batam# ya you went #batam# before right and you know like <malay>macam</malay> some places are very crowded then you know they don't care [one] ya
no but maybe maybe because like
they do though because that time I went national gallery then <malay>dia orang semua duduk dekat</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia orang semua</malay> loiter <malay>dekat</malay> you know that there's this like footpaths
ya and then he shouted it's like a way the way to national gallery then <malay>lepas tu</malay> the maids are all group like crowding there like there's like more than five people crowding
and then <malay>kena pekik</malay> [sia] they were like !oi! is you new like why
what you doing there !huh! (uh) you never read the sign is it
and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> the maid then after that the maid was one of them was stood out and then I was like they talk back to the person then I was like with my friend [lah] then I was like [oh] my god what's this maid doing [ah]
[eh] ya and then okay but I feel like both parties at wrong because the guy don't need to shout
can say nicely right but it could be also like maybe that guy already warn them and then they didn't want to listen then they just stay there so one of them speak up and then the guy was like
I call your employer right now okay I call employer right now then then after that the maid was like [oh] my god
like [ah] like the maid was shocked [lah] when I was in then after that before they even like I don't know I don't know what happen there that's why I don't and before anything else happen
I walk off already because you know me
I don't I don't care
ya I <malay>tak kisah</malay> so I just like walk away and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> they were like I I don't even know what happened next but I just saw the last part was that the maid was keeping quiet
ya because it's okay [lah] but I know what you mean like I don't mean
but maybe but we don't know the story you know
ya
so okay your second wish
or no more wish she already have whatever you want in your life right now
that's not a wish you can
that's a dream
because okay there's a difference between a wish and a dream for me because a wish is something that you think is like impossible but there's still a chance that
it can be achieved through hard work
but you wish it because it's the easier way it's the easy way out
ya but a goal or like a dream is something that you can achieve
<malay>tapi</malay> like
(um) you need to
like you can achieve now [lah] I think I'm sure you can achieve
to travel around the world what it's like it's not that difficult of a dream
ya cause like in singapore so easy [lah] to just travel
you've been to like what so many places already
ya a few already like at your age you know how most people right they like thirty plus or forty plus when they can travel
ya
you are just lucky cause like in singapore <malay>macam</malay> even when you are younger like they will bring you to overseas already like you have a chance to go like china ya school trips or that school overseas trip
!huh!
primary school
ya but mine is only malaysia
ya mine is secondary school is china
and (uh) cambodia and
I forget one more wait china cambodia [ah] and malaysia also port dickson
ya
cause ya
ya [lah] but I think they they will have more opportunities when they go poly cause poly you actually can travel a lot it's just whether you have the money
you can use the account I think
ya ya your edusave account
post secondary [ah]
ya so you use
so it's not the school is that account
ya so we all ya I think singapore <malay>bagi kita</malay> like money to like spend for all these trips [sia] so I think it's like I think that's a good thing [eh]
ya
so can use that
(err) if it there's one country my wish list [lah]
I've already went to that country though
I actually wanted to like when I was younger since young [lah] I always wanted to go japan
cause like when I was younger you know like I don't know I like to watch like #naruto# like you know like
you know they started to have those like anime cris because last time don't have this kind of thing [lah] last time you just spongebob fairy odd parents
ya then slowly #naruto# come in ya [ah] pokemon all this you know and then I was like
[oh] my god
I always wanted to go japan like I see the temple see the ninja and then I was like
!wah!
I'm like it's so nice then you know I got a chance to go
japan for like four months
<malay>dia</malay> sounds like internship [kan] then I was like !wah!
I'm like so lucky cause like that one I think I I spend like two weeks travelling around japan I don't know whether I got tell you
ya so I went like #osaka# #kyoto# #tokyo#
and I when #nara# I went like #kanazawa# then I
ya I went like so many places and like you know every part of japan
no [lah] I went with my friend but I went (um) I think I went #hiroshima# alone
ya
K I don't think you know but it is like mountains and all that then ya and then
it's famous I think it's famous for their ice cream
ya
no it depends because during that time I went was autumn slash winter [eh] wait
is it autumn slash winter ya autumn slash winter so it was only snowing like the last few days but then when you go to the mountain site it's already snowing
ya cause it's it's near the mountain ya the terrain and all that
and then remember like turkey we went it wasn't snowing below but it was snowing upstairs ya it's the same thing [lor]
so like and then like certain place is like quite warm ya
like you know like #tokyo# and #osaka# they rarely snow I think
#tokyo# ya #tokyo# rarely snow
it's just cool ya but the cold is I thought it wasn't it was bearable because usually go this kind of places like K I been to korea right ya what do you mean really
the competition
entrepreneurship competition
[oh] you didn't know I went korea [oh] my god
I showed you ya
[oh] my god you didn't know I went korea
for the competition the
ya
you know do you realize like all the mug that I bought is only [ah] it's like for for all the countries that I've been except for when I was younger
so like china cambodia what do I have [ah] thailand
twenty sixteen
how can you not know
no [lah] I went for like five days only
there
I went to this
#wei# you didn't know I went korea
ya
there are friends I made
ya <malay>macam</malay> like people from korea guam that's why
they know how to speak english
you know all it's the entrepreneur leadership competition they can't speak english they can't join the competition [mah]
ya
no [lah] (um) I think K because
<malay>macam</malay> like <malay>banyak orang</malay> that like
most of them [lah] actually they are all like
english international speaker
so like I mean they are from international school basically so (uh) it's their first language [lah] english is their first language
ya like they use that okay it's not really first language but it's like so called
their communication language their first communication language so they have to speak in english no matter what
ya but korea was fun so I went to
(um) you know the #seoul# tower
I went to wait that lotte world
ya it's damn nice ya #wei# you didn't know I went all these !wah! it's damn nice it's like and you know what everything is paid for
ya
I don't need to pay a single cent
ya
but it's a competition also [lah] that means I have to present
I won third place
I was in the newspaper [what]
ya that is from korea
then microsoft ya then ya for in #temasek# my microsoft
korea bought my bags [mah]
ya that is korea then japan is internship then germany is cause of the competition also
no it's not school
ya and they they wanted to sell the bag but I I stepped out of it cause I don't have the time
than I want to focus on my career and studies rather than doing business cause like even though I think like business <malay>macam</malay> it's easy to
okay [lah] it's not easy it's like is feasible but some you can I can do it but like <malay>macam</malay> I don't feel like I want to pursue it cause I want something to like fall back on like a safety net
ya
[oh] you so you don't know I went korea so sad
ya there's so many places I've been do you know that
ya
korea is fun
really I went there during winter
!huh!
you should go with <malay>afal adik</malay>
I feel like going with your friend [kan]
and going with your family members is different
like going with your friend you have to compromise a lot like you may be good friends
like if like ya during the trip ya you can really see their true colour because like there's how they are at home
like I have a friend that I'm very close with then I went
I I wait
I went #batam# with him like my best friend then I think you know right I remember got one time ya ya so
then then that's why now we are not best friend anymore
ya because of that trip
cause I thought he was okay and all that but then I realise that I go with him right I realize how spoilt he is
like [oh] no I cannot eat it's [oh] no like this place is
like just you know like our family so used to like eating like those kind of like you know <malay>macam tempat</malay>
<malay>tak bersih sangat</malay> [lah] also it's okay ya ya they don't care [one]

[oh] ya
ya
no but he was okay with like the rock you know the they have the hot stones for that he was okay I think the leg scrub all okay I think he wasn't okay with the body massage [lah]
ya cause I think it's different
ya but he's expecting like a five star you know like like treatment for like a one star payment (err) one star price then I was like
!alamak! why you like that

interesting [lah]

ya
ya but I feel like this can be a podcast also like what you said right
like <malay>selamat datang ke</malay> podcast <malay>saya</malay>
ya but I don't think <malay>macam</malay> like podcast [kan] <malay>ada</malay>
they will either speak in either english straight or like malay straight like there's no like in between [kan] ya
(mmhmm)
ya I saw my friend is in a drama
ya
people don't watch them anymore that's why they want to stay relevant but now it's very easy to be a #suria# actor now compared to last time like last time you must be born like with your family of actors ya but now is like
cast needed like everywhere they are looking for casts I think
ya
life
(mmhmm)
so many things like we thought was relevant then it's no longer relevant now
no [lah] like last time you know radio you know newspaper was popular then you know everybody use ya E news no one like subscribe the last time you need to subscribe every month ya it's like damn morning thing
ya but then after that radio become popular then now radio not really no but they they still are relevant because people drive listen to radio ya but then the problem is that podcast is taking over radio cause we fly it's like that's why <malay>bapa</malay> all listening to podcast now
ya

then after that after secondary school I wanted to like legit wear <malay>hijab</malay> and not let guys see see my hair but then like he says that it's okay to see my hair
that kind of
thing ya so after that
[eh] I haven't talk about #azri#
later later okay then after that [oh] #haikal#
#haikal# now with another girl that time <malay>kat</malay> #paya# #paya lebar# <malay>kita nampak dia</malay> [pe]
ya #haikal# don't know [lah] he
ya
actually you you can sense
ya
but he has nice fashion sense
sense
fashion sense
then #afiq#
[oh] that #afiq# was a nice story cause (um) we met through #hakim# then okay so basically (uh) okay so I took for my
then after that (um) that time I only saw #hakim# one time
ya then you know when
ya
I actually
#afiq# didn't know at all
<malay>siapa</malay> no she don't he don't have chinese girlfriend
I think ya ya ya
ya
but then the thing is they are both different like if you see us in person we are very different people I very talkative he's not he's very like
what okay but he's not okay no he's not at all actually he's
he's more noisier than me
okay ya I was the talkative but as far as I know now he talks more than I do like everytime I want to talk he's like he has his own opinion then he's like then I'm like let me talk no but is is good [lah] that he talks now like he is very comfortable with me now
ya
six months together but we dated before that four to five months
ya ya we very long I mean I I can see me in it myself with him for a very long time ya
then after that
he got three other siblings
ya
I don't know #allah# open my heart no legit
no no
I didn't I didn't felt that cause I know I was too young even think about marriage
with #izzat# I didn't even think about it at all but when we started obviously but when I was with #afiq# like he really like he really I mean about the bare necessities he really respected me like he didn't insist on like <malay>nak tengok rambut</malay> pay more runway or something the whole time he that [one]
is the ya but it's very <malay>apa</malay> [oh] ya ya but it's very rare to find cause all my exes like that [one] they don't care that kind of thing
ya and then like #izzat# insist and then it was very like there wasn't really a lot of respect
no he didn't want no he's a very picky guy like he wanted you know all his friends thought that he would end up end up with like some cafe girl chinese cafe girl that kind of thing
then like <malay>dia kerja kat</malay> cafe
ya
ya and <malay>dia kerja</malay> cafe <malay>sekarang</malay> actually I want to no but then it was very like he didn't even <malay>pandang orang bertudung</malay>
ya
legit his friends know that about him and then he out of all his friends he he's the one who don't date much and then like ya and then he used to very mean before he met me like let's say he has a strong opinion again he will just blurt it out like and then if I even if you are good mates with him right he will just like straightforward say [oh] you're not doing your shit better do your shit now that kind of thing like but after he met me he became like better [lah] like he don't straightforward say because he try to <malay>jaga</malay> my <malay>hati</malay> at first he don't know how to <malay>jaga hati perempuan</malay> then I was like at first I was annoyed you know that one month when I started talking to him I actually wanted to stop talking to him you know
no
I just like I just talk to him normally okay I didn't like go to sensitive topics
because I know then he will have like a strong opinion with it I started out slow then sometimes obviously I become mad then I tell him I mad at you he's like <malay>kenapa marah</malay> I was like I don't know you figure out yourself then he's like like it's the first time someone tell him that to him like then after that I think from there he start to take care of feelings more even his friends <malay>cakap</malay> that there is <malay>banyak</malay> difference from him <malay>dulu</malay> and <malay>sekarang</malay> ya which is good [lah] then after that from that like [eh] this guy is different like really really different from my exes

<malay>ini</malay> what pet story <malay>ke apa buat</malay> pet story
[oh] (um) (um)

guys [oh] my god ya ya ya that's like
pick me pick me pick me girls
we're not calling on anybody we're just saying you know
but (um)
ya it kinda sucks
you just need to find friends right

befriend you so they can get to know like your best friend or something like that <malay>tu salah macam salah sikit</malay>

<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] if like if like karma were to like be served to me I think it will be like
however I actually since we're on the topic of relationship it's however like I broke up with my exes will be like returned back to me like ten times fold because [kan] like my brother in law
<malay>dia cakap dengan aku</malay> like (uh) the way I
break up with people <malay>macam</malay> traumatising <malay>sikit</malay>
<malay>dia cakap macam sikit</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>

ya so I think that's like a
like revenge lucky revenge [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
like god just like you deserve it yup ya ya thanks god

[oh] okay for <malay>siapa</malay>
like for myself like for like anybody else [lah]
deserves karma

okay never mind I have (um)
(um) I guess
(um)
I guess my ex
I guess karma I don't know
I will give karma back to him [sia] like <malay>macam</malay>
because he was really misogynistic and really mean
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> like he will say [oh] girls like <malay>perempuan tak boleh buat ni</malay> [pe] <malay>kena ada lelaki semua</malay>
like like

<malay>macam</malay> like you got nothing to prove
you got nothing to prove you got like nothing to your name and then you going to like tell me honey [a'ah]
<malay>aku rasa</malay> because right I realise
if <malay>macam</malay> like
like some guys [kan] <malay>macam</malay> them they try to over like try to be overconfident
<malay>sampai</malay>
just to cover up all their like insecurities which is like
no because [kan] like <malay>kalau dorang macam</malay> like they get into a relationship with you then <malay>dia rasa macam</malay> okay
subconsciously <malay>dorang macam</malay> project their insecurities on to you
then they like if they see you talking to another person who like apparently does not fit
(um) does it's like whatever they are lacking then <malay>dorang macam</malay> insecure <malay>gila babi</malay> then they like [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> I cannot
and then they will like get angry at you for no reason
that's not that's not what we're here for
(um) <malay>tapi</malay> like confidence is good like in a person <malay>tapi macam tapi</malay> [kan] if you're like too overconfident then you are just <malay>macam</malay> hiding something then it should it like you're hiding something to the extent where you are actually projecting your insecurities on other people so please get therapy
please get therapy ya please get help because <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> I don't like the fact that <malay>macam</malay> some guys <malay>ada</malay>
temper issues

like a workplace environment where it's like

I need you to value work and only work and I need you to do all of this for work I need to live breathe work but then [kan]
it's like it's so taxing on the mind that you don't even have like time to like breathe chill you don't like even in school right
like there is no chill you you have like (um) everyday you always got an assignment to do and then you are so like it's so
built up that you are just like when am I ever going to finish this

<malay>madrasah</malay> [lah] like I think primary two but she was like one year older than us so like is in the same class but she's just one year older then her <malay>abang</malay> also inside and her <malay>abang</malay> is like
okay we're like two thousand right she's ninety nine
then like I think her brothers like ninety eight I think but then we are all in the same class so I'm just like so confused like like I ask her like why are you older but in my class then she say [oh] cause like
my parents register late now I didn't know <malay>madrasah</malay> like if you register late they will put you in primary one so like you can be old and be like in primary one also
then
then I knew
I also don't know [sia] but like that <malay>madrasah</malay> doesn't exist anymore so like
I don't know
it was like long long time ago like there were people who like older in my class like by one or two years
but we were in the same class
ya and then after that one day my mom was fetching me right
<malay>naik</malay>
this is at the you know <malay>masjid</malay> #Ghufran#
the in #Tampines#
it's in #Tampines# the <malay>masjid</malay> in #Tampines#
ya then after that
then my mom found out like
[oh] (um) this girl her name is #Aisyah#</P2> #Aisyah#</P2>
#Aisyah#</P2>'s mum is actually
my mum's friend
it's like you and me but like not that close but that we had children then our children are like
friends
ya so like me and #Aisyah#</P2> we like
grow up together [lah] like ever since like that that whole encounter in like primary two so I was like primary two primary three
[eh] ya ya something like that
ya
ya but they weren't like very close so it's like I think you know [eh] it's like (um)
if me and
[oh] it's like if you and (err)
how to say [ah]
[ah] it's like you and #Sheila#</P2> like
(uh) got kids and then your your kids and #Sheila#</P2>'s kids
like become friends
and then like you become closer to
no no no but they're closer than that
I don't know [sia] okay like I give up explaining but like whatever yeah they're like quite close [lah]
then [ah] like you and the other Eli</P2> your class <malay>punya</malay> Eli</P2>
yeah so
ya ya ya ya ya then after that
[oh] my god I miss her ya okay anyway then after that right
stop laughing then after that
then (um) so like
we grow up together [lah] from like primary school <malay>madrasah</malay> then after that we go to like you know like like (um)
they have like the #macam# kids alive teens alive tweens alive
<malay>kau tak pergi madrasah</malay> [eh]
<malay>kau tak pergi madrasah</malay>
[oh] my god you Andalus child [oh] my god okay so like okay let me explain [ah] like when you go to <malay>madrasah</malay> right like at at a <malay>masjid</malay>
they used to have like <malay>madrasahs</malay>
like
let's say okay let's say you go to a <malay>madrasah</malay> in (um) <malay>masjid</malay> right like <malay>dulu dulu punya</malay> format [kan] is like <malay>madrasah</malay> #macam#
(err) it's like literal school but just <malay>madrasah</malay> like you got exam and then like got report card <malay>semua</malay> then like they band
ya ya okay so basically it's like an Andalus [lah] then then they band you according to how smart you are whatever then got the morning session and then the
then the morning session and the afternoon session [lah] yah so like
I think
I think like
the first few years #Aisyah#</P2> was
(um)
like afternoon session or whatever [lah] that's how I know like that's how I know a lot of people in the in the #Tampines# area who are like malays cause like I go to like this <malay>masjid punya madrasah</malay> and then like
cause you mix class every time [what] so you just make friends with everyone in that class
yeah
then
then after that like me and so
so halfway through
(err) the primary school like when I was in primary school right they created this #macam# new syllabus <malay>abeh</malay> like is everything #macam# in english [ah] english [ah] then like #macam# <malay>tak ada</malay> exams everything is for like
(uh) you know those people who convert
to islam
then like they don't understand Malay or anything
ya is yeah yeah so cause <malay>dia dia nak</malay> #macam# like
(um) integrated society or whatever so they so they like abolished they abolished the <malay>madrasah</malay> the <malay>madrasah punya</malay> system so there's no more like exam or anything cause we actually had a Chinese girl in our class
and then like she <malay>kesian</malay> [sia] all the textbooks all in Malay <malay>abeh dia tak faham</malay> like she was just like so confused and the only thing she could can understand ya the only thing she can understand is the Arab cause like
the teacher teach in Arab right then whatever she don't understand she can actually ask in English and the textbook is in Arabic what so like she'll just translate on her own but everything else is in Malay and then like she just couldn't understand
ya so like
like imagine a literal small #Kahir#</P2> inside
inside and then like he's just struggling cause like he only understand chinese ya then after that halfway through she left
he doesn't
ya he doesn't he only knows Chinese
<malay>apa kau</malay> okay maybe cause like he learn cause like what then
like <malay>banyak melayu</malay> [kan] but then I don't know [lah]
yeah
you know that time we go to his house for <malay>raya</malay> right then his <malay>nenek</malay> ask #Kahir#</P2> <malay>siapa tu</malay> then after that he just shake shake he just like !huh! he just like shake his (um)
like shoulders then I ask you understand malay [meh] then he said
(err) I don't know [lah] but I just anyhow just give her response then she just [oh] okay then I'm just like how you speak to your grandmother like that then then after that he say [oh] [ah] usually when I go to my grandma's house right she will give me food then I'm just like (um) <malay>sedap sedap sedap</malay>
yeah it's basically ya food related
I don't know I don't even know if he knows <malay>lawa</malay>
but he listens to Malay songs now
<malay>tak faham</malay> [sia] <malay>aku tak aku pun tak faham</malay> bro just don't ask me
okay so so this Camila</P2> girl right okay the chinese girl is named Kayla</P2> then this Camila</P2> girl she
(um)
she did she got transferred out like after primary three she <malay>tahan</malay> from primary one all the way to primary three bro then after primary three right when they introduced the aLIVE thing then she transferred to aLIVE so there's like Kids aLIVE tweens aLIVE teens aLIVE then youth aLIVE so it's like technically like
(um)
kindergarten then primary school then secondary school all the way until like you finished poly or whatever [lah] then
then after we finish our <malay>madrasah</malay>
then me and #Aisyah#</P2> went to
Teens aLIVE
[eh]
is it Teens aLIVE [oh] ya ya ya secondary school is Teens aLIVE ya then we go to Teens aLIVE right together with her brother and then like coincidentally
(err) her mum said [oh] I put her in the Sunday class cause like confirm secondary school Saturday <malay>nak kena balik sekolah punya</malay> so I just put her in Sunday so she can go on Sunday then my mum was like yeah yeah I put her in Sunday also so like we just ended up sticking through like four plus

what's your plan I mean like (err) I there was like I wanted to ask you about something like I had plans
the other day
but (uh) I forgot
to I mean like I had I wanted to do plans with you but then I forgot about it then after that I remembered
(err) like a few months ago and then like COVID happened and then I feel like it just took
way longer for me to like text you about it
it's okay
yeah
yeah I was supposed to go for like two concerts this year you know I was supposed to go for #yungblud# and rex orange county <malay>tapi</malay> like COVID
(mm) <malay>begitu</malay> [lah] <malay>nak buat apa</malay> [kan]
(mmhmm)
yeah like (uh) I also was supposed to travel a lot this year
then like
then like (err) I was supposed to like travel for a few countries and stuff but then like
I I just didn't have I mean because of COVID it didn't happen and also like
like
I was supposed to go I think like (um)
you know the good vibes fest at (um) #genting#
yeah I was supposed to go there and I mean and I mean it was like my first
apparently like supposedly my [ah] first [ah] music festival [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> like excited [kan]
<malay>habis</malay> COVID <malay>habis</malay> like <malay>pun tak boleh masuk</malay> I really miss you know I want to go like
you know <malay>makan sate malam malam</malay>
(mmhmm)
yeah Ramly burger at the side of the road [oh] my god I miss that you know it's always like
<malay>murah</malay> and it's like so nice to
eat at night
(mmhmm)
[oh] yeah like that's really sad it's like those like side
of the road thingy right I had
a maid like who like lives in like she we still keep in contact with her after like
you know after she left (um) indonesia
then like she sell (err) she her husband sold those like <malay>bakso</malay> cuts you know
and because of COVID cafe [dah] <malay>tutup</malay> [seh] then <malay>macam</malay> like we feel very bad because it's like
she's kind of like she lives in a <malay>kampung</malay> right then she just like gave birth and then like
<malay>tak ada duit</malay> like the only source of income was like
from her husband then <malay>macam</malay> like baby <malay>tak ada duit</malay> then the other time
we called her during <malay>raya</malay> the baby <malay>tengah demam</malay> [seh]
but
yeah I mean like my we sent her some money [lah] like me and my
like mum's siblings and stuff cause we like <malay>kita</malay> like very <malay>rapat dengan dia</malay>
(mm)
I have an uncle that lives there like I remember like (um) during
<malay>bila raya</malay> right like <malay>dia orang tak boleh keluar negeri</malay> you know like I mean
if they live in you have to stay in then after that like you like for <malay>raya</malay> you cannot <malay>balik kampung</malay> which is like
because for them it's like
their <malay>bandar</malay> is right so like their family members are all back in like #kampungs# and stuff
so like they couldn't leave they just like stayed there
yeah that's not the case but I think I mean like I think it's also just because (uh) during like <malay>hari raya</malay> like that time
like it was like still not stable at all you know I mean it was like the same here [lah] we couldn't like leave anything
I mean we could not like leave the house or anything for them it's just like
they can't do anything I mean they from what I know it's like theirs more strict
but everybody still tries to get out
which is really bad you know what I heard though like there are people who
like try to leave by car right and then like there were like the police or something that dress up like <malay>pocong</malay> just for them to go home
yeah like you know the police or some volunteers [lah] you know <malay>macam</malay> they dress up <malay>macam pocong gitu habis</malay> just to like
scare cause like <malay>malam malam</malay> [kan] <malay>dekat</malay>
<malay>dekat hutan semua tu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> like it scared them and then like
<malay>patah balik</malay> [sia] I got see a video of it it was kind of funny
yeah
(mm)
I think they did tried to do the same <malay>kat</malay> indonesia also during like the whole lock down thing but then
like honestly indonesians are not fazed by the
by like any sort of ghost
(hmm)
why I mean like yeah I mean like I think in singapore it's not too bad like compared to like maybe in the west <malay>gitu</malay>
but like okay [lah] I mean like it's still a big change in the life right
what do you mean you're not you don't you're not in school like I mean don't you have like
you don't need you no you don't need to go to campus is it
(mm)
how is the exam going to be conducted do you have to go to campus this time
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
it's all <malay>pakai</malay> laptop [eh]
like
like you <malay>pakai</malay> laptop then like it's just what like
in the classroom then it's like just like everybody has to social distance
[oh]
(mmhmm)
honestly I mean like
it's hard to be motivated at a time like this right then like most of my classes now since I'm like self studying and then like and stuff like that like it's not
physical so it's always just like online
so it's like like you said [lah] it's like same goes to you I guess it's like really hard to focus and then it's just like for me I work best with one to one
but like technically this is one to one but not like directly in front of me so it's like a bit
hard to focus but I think I'm okay it's like
since it's september [eh] september now right it's like
end of next month which is like like the exams is end of next month which is like super fast in my opinion
is I think is in England it's here
yeah so but like they did
make amendments [lah] for the topics I guess cause is like
for example like the sec four topics right like some of them are redacted
removed and stuff because it's like they we don't have the time to like
they didn't have the time to like properly like teach us stuff
then like I know my paper they are removing a big
big question from like
I think supposedly a topic that was supposed to be like taught this year
actually I can do I mean like I'm not very good with numbers in general but like
I could do math better than I do like I
back then like I was so bad at it but like I'm just giving myself a shot cause
it's like I'm just trying to work for my future at this point
but
yeah I mean like
even if with the topics being redacted and stuff like
I think the bell curve is going to be higher which kind of is going to suck so
(mmhmm)
yeah that's like my second time taking it so it like really sucks I mean like
I hope they understand the whole situation and also like maybe in future like
next year when they're like you know the intake for like tertiary education I hope there will be more lenient on it because it's like we
everybody is having a bad year this year I feel
but I mean
I understand what you feel [lah] like I also cannot like focus at home because like I have like four siblings and I have a naggy mother if I'm being honest
so it's like
sometimes when I'm doing my work and she's just my mum's always at home just like <malay>kenapa tak buat</malay>
you know like <malay>kenapa tak buat</malay>
(err) <malay>tak tak tak tolong mak</malay> or something like that you know so I'm just like
you know I can never focus but then again like I'm better on my own
no matter the place like it doesn't have to be at home or anything
(mm)
only time will tell how we'll be like as marks you know in future
hopefully we're still friends by then
what were you doing yesterday
like
(mm)
(mmhmm)
yeah I mean like same I mean like I met
(err) #rifky# in the morning because like
I told you [kan] like the day before I <malay>pergi</malay> (err) the malayan council
then (err) you know portion <malay>dia orang</malay> [kan] <malay>besar</malay> [kan] so like I couldn't finish it so I brought home
and then I tried eating like that night itself I tried eating it again and it's still so much so like
#rifky# (err) I called #rifky# in the morning I said like !hey! do you want food
like you know I cannot finish and I don't want to throw it away because like <malay>mahal</malay> [kan]
then (uh) he's like okay so I just met him and then like <malay>kita lepak</malay>
<malay>sekejap</malay> I got screened by an officer at like that hour I thought like I also like to <malay>panjat</malay> you know cause like
they were just doing their roundings [ah] but I didn't expect them to be like there that hour
but yeah I mean it was nothing
then after that like afterwards I just like stayed at home I didn't really do much
also then after that like at night I went to like <malay>jumpa kawan</malay> you know just to <malay>lepak</malay> also
like
late at night [lah]
I don't know there's this thing called the the <malay>rendang daging salai</malay> or something
like it was so it's super nice it's like (um)
it taste like you know the <malay>kuah</malay> is sort of like <malay>rendang</malay> then with linguine with like scallops
<malay>sotong</malay> and then there's like <malay>daging salai</malay> on top [lah] which is like I don't know
very innovative in my opinion
really <malay>sedap</malay> [lah] it's like a taste of like you know you I feel like a lot of fusion foods don't really work out <malay>tapi</malay> for them is like for western and malay food to work it's like
it's nice
(mmhmm)
yeah I mean like I'm not sure about <malay>rendang</malay> being the nicest but
I mean I've been there a few times and then like generally I feel like nothing there is
<malay>tak sedap</malay> you know everything is <malay>sedap</malay>
and yeah I mean like I recommend you to eat it but then it is a very big portion so that's one thing
and yeah I mean like I went to arab street like technically it was a sunday that I went there right
I kind of just don't really like going to these places in general in like
no I mean like I I'm fine with it but if it's like a weekday cause <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>tak ramai orang</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> especially with the whole COVID thing I <malay>pun</malay> like a bit paranoid you know there's like so many people
but it's okay [lah] I mean like I still like the atmosphere there [lah] it's just that it was like very hot and there were so many people so I got a bit like fussy
[oh] I ate with my family because it's like my it was my sister's birthday
then after that my sister like just requested that she wanted to eat there because like
ever since we tried there once like it became like our favorite place to eat
(mmhmm)
yeah that's what I feel also like
cause like I don't mind like paying for that price cause like it's <malay>sedap</malay> you know and then like
they from my experience right whenever like we go there like I think
pre pre COVID [lah] they like to give us like free stuff like for example like free cake or like sometimes they give free mussels <malay>gitu</malay>
(um) but yeah [lah] but I I think after COVID like they kind of cut down on it and stuff
but
I mean it is arab street [lah] everything there is like <malay>mahal</malay> and yeah it's a once in a while thing so
[ah] you get it [lah]
you know [ah] there's this place I like to eat also it's called (um) indobowl
okay so like asides from indonesian food right they actually have this twist on like
[ah] Indomie then after that they have like for example like
<malay>ayam madura</malay> which is like [oh] yeah
<malay>ayam geprek</malay> you know something like that like very indonesian based
side dishes and then they just infuse it together
it's a really nice concept honestly and it's really nice and the price is not so bad you know not as expensive as (um)
like (um) malayan council I mean like
a meal can go up to like eight to fifteen dollars for one it's not bad really
yeah basically then there's this [ah] I mean they have this platter thingy which I believe is
about forty dollars but it's meant to be shared but I tell you it's super nice and I don't know
I've always had good experiences with it I went there once and I kept going a few times it was just like not it's like the price point also not so bad you know
but it's just a bit <malay>leceh</malay> cause like arab street and some of like it's in the middle of the road
yeah actually same [lah] the other time when I was like you know because before COVID I had a job and then like
you know I could like treat myself to these kind of things like once a month at least
but now like ever since COVID I also have no money
and like
yeah so I've been trying to apply for jobs you know but I've been very access unsuccessful about it
what about you
I don't know I use you know like <malay>kat</malay> Telegram they have those <malay>macam</malay> groups [kan] then <malay>macam</malay>
the thing about that is they advertise it to make it sound really like attractive you know then okay to be fair like I tried to
(uh) applied for a lot also then like some a lot also never get back to me then some of them like
you know they mention things like for example like [oh] they never mentioned the pay like <malay>berapa</malay> or just like
[oh] you have to go through this course first and we won't pay you for it and stuff and then <malay>macam</malay> like
<malay>benda gini</malay> all should be like you know when you advertise it should like it should be there [what]
<malay>habis dia orang tak ni</malay> so I was just like
like is it worth like doing something like that I mean like as much as I'm desperate for a job also I'm just like is it still worth it
(mm)
yeah and then it's like <malay>macam</malay> cause like sometimes like
they will say like [oh] we'll get back to you if we need you something like that in my opinion I feel like
because the waiting is very dreadful you know so I rather you just text me and say like I didn't get the job like
at least <malay>tak payah</malay> you know <malay>terfikir fikir</malay> you know <malay>kalau dapat ke tak</malay>
and like in the meantime at least I know
whether I should be applying for more jobs or I should like you know stop finding because like knowing I'll have the job or something
and yeah [lah] I mean like it's just
frustrating [lah] and then like you know these agents also sometimes they just
don't tell you the full truth then <malay>macam</malay> like I feel so cheated by it if I'm being honest
(mmhmm)
yeah I agree with that I mean like
I mean like I've worked a few jobs and stuff and then like you know so far I've been successful at getting it so like
this really hurts my heart that I've been so I've been rejected so many times
but and also like in a time like this you know like
everybody needs something but at the same time I understand why it's hard to hire people but at the same
time everybody's also broke so like
I don't know [lah] hopefully we'll get a job soon [lah] hopefully
actually [ah] I also under like over underestimated the fact that you know like COVID
<malay>akan lama gini</malay> you know
cause like I thought like when it first came to singapore I'm like okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
just like outside people right and then after that there are people like singaporeans that got it then suddenly like
there was a spike and all that and it got (mm) like I was thinking to myself like okay this like whole [ah]
thing is not gonna die it's not going to
like go away any time soon
but I thought like okay [lah] like <malay>lama lama pun</malay> maybe by the end of august or something but look it's september and it's still the same thing
and at most <malay>apa apa boleh makan kat luar</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi</malay> still need to wear mask and then like I'm just like
I like I also did a lot of online shopping I also did a lot like
Grab delivery and stuff because then I mean like Grab
I ordered Grab cause like
I was just so lazy to cook like it was so hard to be productive during circuit breaker
then all I did was just like
order food and order a lot of things online so I thought like maybe after circuit breaker I'll also get a job but
I didn't know it was still going to be hard
yeah
(hmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
then it's like they
like they prioritize so much about being like you know like
they prioritise so much about their free speech and then you know their rights as like you know doing this and that
but it's more of just like
you know you're like okay yeah you have your rights but at the same time like
look at the situation [lah] like you not using your mask and stuff like that like okay you want to die that's your problem but then don't
be hard on other people you know there are like people who are like you know auto immune you know which are more prone to the virus and stuff like that and
if it hits them it will be like ten times harder on them as well like you know average person
so yeah I mean
then like the other time also like I was watching the news
like cause like
(err) they were (err) the leading
doctor or scientist of
the whole like COVID situation in
(um) the right they were I think explaining to donald trump saying that
[oh] if you leave if you like you know stay out in the hot or the sun it will like you know
kill the bacteria of like the COVID faster
so like on surface you know like technically it can be passed through surfaces right but if it's a hot or if you sanitize it and stuff it will like die
so that stupid idiot of a president <malay>cakap</malay> [kan] like
like I don't know whether like how he read it or something but he was saying like
[oh] maybe (uh) we can look into like injecting ourselves with sanitizers with bleach and stuff like there were like you know
like the president <malay>cakap</malay> [lah] and then the next day
really <malay>ada orang ni</malay> [seh] like actually drank bleach and stuff
hoping to not get the (uh) virus then I'm like thinking to myself just like how are you
how is it possible that you even entered politics you know
like from what I heard right
like when he was making the speech
the doctor was just like staring at him like you know thinking like you know just like
why did I get myself into this into this
yeah
and then like it was really bad to the point that you know like mayors of different states
had to like
even tweet it out and say like you know
I can't believe I need to say this but please do not
drink detergent or like don't drink sanitizers or cleaning products
(mm) <malay>tapi macam</malay> like a bit
I don't know [ah] cause I feel like
that this like donald trump like <malay>macam dia punya</malay> priorities is just not
the people like he's so I guess business forward
to the point that he was like more focused on
like the economy and stuff like
that I mean I get it [lah] like the economy is like important and stuff but then like
you can't have an economy if you don't have people right
so is like I think he was briefed and I watched this TikTok somewhere that he was briefed
about the whole COVID situation
(um) way like in like january like before he was
like before it like it it wouldn't really like stepped into
(um) the (err) the or like the just the western world in general
then like
he only took action like during may
you know then [ah] before that like I was watching like patriot act or something right then he was
there was this like whole like cause like the
it started spreading through like beef
industries and stuff like that because like
they didn't (err) they didn't let
the (uh) the workers like not
like you know social distance and stuff like that and then they were like
and then like
there's this like act I forgot like what
it's called but it's like
you
can mass produce stuff
in times of like crisis or war for example like when there's a war the act
then like the (mm)
president can (uh) enable this act so that you know they can mass produce like maybe like
metals and stuff like
war planes and stuff like that so I don't know why but it mass him
enabled that for the beef industry
which was so bad cause like you know like it was already <malay>tengah</malay> COVID
and then like I don't know why he decided to do it for you know then he was saying like cause
(um)
most of the things are like you know like they are running out of food of something like that
something like that and plus like the cows
because of COVID like
they're all like
unattended because of the thingy but like the thing is like he put an act on that and not on like
for example like masks and like medical supplies because like
(uh) most medical supplies were from China and stuff and then they were like you know
there wasn't a shipment at that point of time but then in the have their own manufacturers but the thing is that
I don't know why it wasn't
acted on that and then for a moment there wasn't enough like
supplies for the medical team back in the
so I feel so <malay>macam kasihan</malay> for them [lah] that they have such a bad president like this
and then also like with the whole like drinking bleach thing like it's a common sense [kan] apparently common sense isn't not
common at all you know like so <malay>kasihan</malay> !huh!
who
I don't know dinosaur
[oh] okay that is so stupid
what's his name
!hey! that's not bad I mean like no offence [lah] but for an average <malay>melayu</malay> you know it's
okay [lah] like you know you cannot expect much from <malay>orang melayu</malay> [lah] honestly sorry but yeah
yeah [lah] I mean like you put in effort also right so it's like then like
for them like to not
you know reciprocate also it's a bit like <malay>sakit hati</malay>
but yeah I mean like how's your time I mean like how how long have you been on OkCupid
yeah I mean I used to be on OkCupid also and then I received like the
funniest things I also I don't feel like I'm so picky also [lah] but then like yeah those like
#yo# and boring one like okay [lah] maybe I close one eye if you are good looking but like
<malay>kau tahu macam</malay> boring [seh] like
you I don't know I mean like you want to like capture somebody's attention [lah] like
<malay>cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>benda</malay> interesting you know I received a joke once like
okay (err) there was [ah]
this person said
(uh) what did the okay cause like
(um) what did (err) what did the drummer name his daughters
yeah
so like you know my name is anna right so it's like
(uh) the answer is anna one anna two
anna one two three four
(mm)
(hmm)
yeah I mean like I I mean like I don't know how he
like got it maybe like it's a typical joke but then like it only works for people with the name anna I mean like how often do you know
of a girl named anna right
then also like I don't know that got me started talking
to him you know he was like really interesting and stuff but like I think it didn't really move on from there because like you know dating apps
you don't really move on that far
<malay>cinta</malay> like I that time like during I was on like dating apps like
literally I was on all like I was on Tinder Bumble OkCupid because I was so bored during circuit breaker
[oh] okay so Bumble right
basically right for example like
okay as like
like for example if I (uh) if a guy like I swipe right to either like guys or girls
and for example like
if it's a guy the guy cannot text first
like it's always the girl that has to like initiate <malay>dulu</malay> [ah]
<malay>habis</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> for a girl I don't know how it works but I believe
if you are the first one to swipe then like you haven't like
matched yet right then you don't have to start the conversation but if you are the one who swipes later and
you get the match right you have to be the one who starts a conversation and there's a time limit for you
like for example like there's
from the second you match <malay>ada</malay> like
<malay>dua puluh empat jam</malay> for you to (uh) respond then like
(uh) I mean (err) for you to text then the second you text
the person has twenty four hours to respond then from then there's just no timer
it's a very interesting concept actually
no I think it's <malay>macam</malay> like concept <malay>baru</malay> because <malay>macam</malay> like typically it's always like the guys that have to like
create a like you know an intro or like you know they are the ones that have like
start a conversation but this time it's like the
it's a reverse role so it forces you to want to text people
which is interesting [lah] but honestly I find like Bumble has like more good looking guys
I feel like not the typical like you know
like wipey <malay>mat melayu</malay> sort of things like you'll actually find like
I don't know cause like not a lot of people use Bumble compared to OkCupid and Tinder
so <malay>macam</malay>
yeah [lah] like
(err) there's I find more like foreigners there and stuff <malay>tapi</malay> now I don't know [lah] I mean like cause
[dah]
[dah] [dah] like COVID [eh] so I don't know how many foreigners are still left in singapore
yeah I tried K Fry but okay honestly
maybe I had my expectations too high or something or maybe
I have like an like an idea of how it tastes in my head
it was a bit disappointing [eh]
but maybe I mean like maybe you'll enjoy maybe I'll enjoy it but maybe I just wouldn't put
like it's just not as nice as I thought it would be
but [ah] there's this thing called like a rice ball or something they mix it with like
sushi and like [eh] not sushi sorry (um)
like rice seaweed and like different stuff that one was nice but then like
would I go there for the chicken again I'm not sure
but like
the vibes is nice if I'm being honest and it's
okay [lah] for malaysia standard it's slightly pricey
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
no
you caught me at salted egg
I want to try the Din Tai Fung
cause like Din Tai Fung <malay>sana</malay> [kan] <malay>halal</malay> right so like I want to give it a try but like
never got the chance to like I normally every year always <malay>naik</malay> like with my family
it just became like an unknown tradition then this year <malay>tak dapat pergi</malay> it feels so weird you know cause like
(um)
normally when I go to I get very like <malay>jelak</malay> because it's like there's not really much to do besides like you know chill
and just like you know go shopping and stuff
<malay>tapi</malay> like
this year <malay>tak dapat pergi</malay> it's just like I want to go back
so bad you know I want to see family enjoy the cheap food
then sometimes I like to like you know just make a little trip to like at night
and then like you know just
have fun [lah] you know cause like
I have friends now who
have motorcycles
I sneak out I just like take my passport and I just go but like
it's fun it's fun
yeah I love pepper lunch okay I accidentally tried it in singapore before cause like
I thought <malay>halal tapi tak halal</malay> then after that I tried in malaysia and like I'm just like I'm so in love I can't believe this is not <malay>halal</malay> in singapore
yeah but didn't did like the last time I think the last time I went to didn't like we see each other by accident
it was like at or something right
(mm)
yeah it was so funny I remember I waved at you and then my family all just like turned around just like
(oo) who is that why do you have friends I'm like no
but I was from a wedding <malay>tu</malay> I like
I came in like my <malay>kebaya</malay> so it's kind of funny but then at the same time like I think it's kind of normal
I mean it was fun (uh) I mean like (err) I think at the point of time I was at
a wedding near right but then like
me and my cousins all <malay>nak cabut</malay> because like
we just didn't have the social battery to like you know like
just have like (uh)
to communicate with like our other (uh) relatives cause this is like a bit of like extended family it's like my dad's
cousins so it's like <malay>rapat</malay> but
not very <malay>rapat</malay>
but yeah cool [lah] then after Starbucks we like went to the Apple store
like then my (uh) my cousin bought like a macbook there which is like cheaper you know apparently
yeah then after that like just nice [lah] like he just bought everything there cause he was like starting school also
(hmm)
(mmhmm)
yeah I think I get you I mean okay honestly I'm not like the biggest fan of like
going for like #jemputans# and stuff like that <malay>pasal macam</malay> like when growing up <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I don't know I'm like very <malay>rimas</malay> cause <malay>macam panas</malay> [kan] then you have to like dress up <malay>semua</malay> and then like
<malay>pergi</malay> [ah] wedding <malay>tapi tak kenal siapa</malay> you know then <malay>macam</malay> I
told my parents I said like yeah I'm not going to go anymore <malay>tapi</malay> I do enjoy if it's like
my family members you know I really miss it too
then you talking about the <malay>biryani</malay> like I think it's always a star of the show right then (um)
<malay>satu kali</malay> that time (uh) my my aunt I think
yeah no my aunt's (um) cousin
like from her other side then like we
just I just decided to go [lah] because like <malay>macam</malay> I was I I know her [what]
then she <malay>kahwin</malay>
(err) an indian muslim guy and the food was so good like
the <malay>biryani</malay> was just like next level
and yeah I kind of miss it like you know like it's also like free food right
so like <malay>tak payah makan</malay> for the rest of the day
and then like sometimes they always like <malay>kasi kita bawa balik</malay> then like got the <malay>ayam masak merah</malay> then the <malay>nasi minyak</malay> and all that
I love it
[ah]
yeah yeah yeah for me it's like
okay okay <malay>nasi biryani</malay> would be the first one I think of then next will probably be like <malay>nasi minyak</malay>
then like <malay>rendang</malay> and <malay>ayam masak merah</malay> that is like the three I mean that's like the staples I mean then maybe like
I don't know
like from [ah] (um) you know <malay>ikan tiga rasa</malay> like you know the crispy fish and stuff like that
other than that I feel like what else is not like why wouldn't there be <malay>biryani</malay> and stuff like that's so weird
yes [oh] my god like
I mean it's it's stated in the name already you know it has to be there
okay but I remember some (um) the other time like I had an aunt
who like got married like during like the second week of <malay>raya</malay> and I feel like
okay [lah] I mean like for (mm) for me for for you like you want to do anything like
you know it's your wedding right go ahead but I very <malay>pantang</malay> you know cause I feel like I'm from a
very big family then like I always need to finish like my visiting and stuff like that
then like to have a wedding <malay>macam</malay> like no offence [ah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> like spoil [seh]
there's such thing
then might as well don't do a big wedding right just <malay>kahwin</malay> like or something you know
like your focuses are wrong [seh] but
I mean like why why do people do it <malay>buat penat</malay> [jer] cause like normally like
people are just more tired during <malay>ramadhan</malay> you know and then like
you know people want to like you know
<malay>kejar maghrib</malay> and stuff like that just to eat with their family then like you know there's <malay>terawih</malay> and stuff like that I think this
wedding would really spoil that I don't know how that works
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay> I
[ah] I think recently they (uh) <malay>naikkan</malay> to maybe I think fifty
<malay>yang</malay>
(mm)
that's what I thought also like at first cause like
I I mean like the idea of it being small it's like okay I get it you know like small wedding then <malay>macam</malay> bigger honeymoon [lah] <malay>kirakan tapi macam</malay>
I think about it [eh] it's like
I'm also like the first child right so <malay>macam</malay> I feel like I understand my parents point <malay>macam dia nak</malay> you know show us off or something
and then also like personally I feel like I have a lot of friends too and I feel like you know <malay>kalau tak</malay>
invite <malay>satu</malay> like if I invite like <malay>sikit sikit tu</malay> I don't want like <malay>dia orang sakit hati ke apa</malay>
you know but at the end of the day like I mean like
<malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>macam mana</malay> if anything also just like <malay>kahwin sikit sikit</malay> then like you know like
have a reception afterwards then like have a bigger honeymoon right it's always better
(mm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
for me like
cause like I come my parents (uh) my grandparents are originally like from like malacca
you know so <malay>macam</malay> like a lot of like the <malay>kampung kampung</malay> roots are still in within my family
so <malay>macam</malay> like a lot of things I do is still very traditional like personally I would still want that whole
you know <malay>macam</malay> gantry thing like you know you have to like fight your way to get in to see the bride and then like the whole
<malay>silat</malay> thing I think I I it's just for traditional purposes you know but then like
I don't know for for me I guess a tradition
like the tradition I would want to omit out is just it being very big and with people I don't know
or like but at the end of the day it's just like I'm I mean like it's
if I were to get married in future you know it's like I <malay>pengantin apa</malay> like it's like I will be <malay>pengantin</malay> once in my life only [what] so <malay>macam</malay> like
to make it like stand out okay [lah] maybe I'm a bit narcissistic also I just want it to be like that wedding that people will never forget you know and I want ice cream
(hmm)
<malay>kirakan</malay>
actually I don't want to I don't want do it under the block though cause personally I just feel like <malay>panas</malay> cause like
I'm just not a fan of that maybe at most like you know
see see at least got like (err) got aircond then you know
like you can still house like a lot of people and stuff and also like I'm pretty sure there's a playground nearby so like <malay>budak kecil</malay> all can like run around
yeah I don't know I'm like everytime I go like weddings or something I'm always like in my head like
planning my own wedding like okay how is this going to pan out and stuff
(oo) !ee!
is it the one with eddie murphy
is it
(mm)
it's okay man like I've been thinking about my like future since I was like
since I was like you know really young too like eleven you know like I have a name from my
first daughter you know I mean like this sounds super <malay>geli</malay> and it's so <malay>merepek</malay> cause like considering I'm only like ninety right but like
yeah I mean I have (err) I have names for like maybe my future children then like (uh) (um)
my first child I plan it to I plan for it to be like luna #malika#
I haven't thought of like a guy's name but pretty sure I like the name #maliki#
and I don't know I like the name like
#ayla# like A Y L A you know because I feel like
[ah] it's such a nice name you know it's like a unique but like not so hard to pronounce name
I feel especially with the fact that you know you you're just at home alone and then you don't really think much
it happens you know like for me is like I already picture what kind of house I want to have and stuff like where I want it to be located and stuff
like you know like in a singaporean like you know setting [lah] obviously like
but as much as I want to have like a
five storey bungalow something like
I'm pretty sure it's possible here but also like I I need to hustle way too much I mean way too hard to get there
(mmhmm)
sometimes I think about it also like
isn't it like for me like I think if it's like better for me to just my migrate because it's like
you know <malay>macam</malay> like considering like the financial and stuff like that like is it like worth
you know having everything but then I think again like all my family is here
then after with the whole COVID situation like so many like governments just like you know all the problems just came up
as much as I feel like it's a bad thing that but it's so [ah] it's also like a good thing that I feel like you know like the problems are being addressed but yeah mean like
for now at least I feel like
(mm) I'll just stay here
for the time being if not then
I'm [oh] I mean I'll just pack up and leave
yeah I mean (um)
I mean I don't understand [ah] for me is like I've always wanted to go overseas also and study but like
I thought about it like australia is a bit too near I mean like it's not to near it's more of like [dah] <malay>banyak</malay>
singaporeans there's <malay>banyak</malay> asians then like you know the whole like #kiasu# thing going on
and
like you know it's just very competitive like in within the asian culture
so I think to myself just like you know okay [lah] then <malay>mat salleh</malay> at least I know I got chance to be the top right <malay>tapi</malay> like
<malay>dengan</malay> asians maybe not you know so I I've always thought like maybe I want to
go europe or something you know with like a whole different language like I want to learn a new language and stuff but then I thought about it [lah] like
<malay>nak</malay> migrate like like you said [lah] with the whole like tradition
(uh) like you know it's like very like new like you [dah] <malay>biasa</malay> with the whole family gathering then I thought about it like
cause I did early childhood before and then like
to be in the environment with like your culture and stuff will like
it's better [lah] cause like the child will grow up like you know understanding it better so like for me if I'm like let's just say I move to europe
my it's going to be hard for my child to learn like
basically like three languages like for example like if I don't speak the language
like of that european country let's just say it's Spain right then like my child have to learn to like
learn malay learn it's like english and also like
spanish and also like learn the culture there then they won't have like any ties to like
singapore cause like you know they never grew up in singapore which is like a bit sad [lah] cause it's like you know it is my culture and then I want to bring it down also so
I guess like
staying in singapore is always like the best option and plus like you know being a singaporeans there's always like benefits
with like the whole like healthcare and stuff like you know
like housing healthcare
as much as it's expensive it's still like beneficial
(mmhmm)
yeah [oh] my same [lah] cause like I my my mum's malay is like super good like apparently she got like A one or something back in
secondary school and then she became a malay teacher once and then she was saying [ah] like
[oh] my god like none of my children can speak malay and she was like especially you you know
like I've also been called like <malay>celup</malay> [lah] like back in secondary school like I couldn't do malay at all you know
and then like my mum was saying [lah] like
(um) [ah] my mum was saying saying like [ah] like
in future she wants to take care of my children and for the main purpose is because
she wants to pass down her malay down because she said I don't trust you <malay>dengan</malay> your <malay>melayu</malay>
<malay>gitu</malay> but I feel like if I think about it if I ever get married to a malay guy he like one requirement is that he has to speak better malay than I am because I
for sure cannot help them with their malay
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh]
no [lah] I feel like it's also important cause <malay>macam</malay> like it's just like your self identity <malay>juga apa</malay> then like
I feel like at least in singapore also <malay>macam</malay> like the malay community is like
rapidly <malay>macam</malay> the language is dying you know I feel like
personally because <malay>macam</malay> like okay [lah] like if you were to
make me like you know sit in a malay class in malay in <malay>bahasa</malay> (err) in malaysia or something I feel like even the top scorer of my malay class
would not be able to do as well
because it's like
it's just different [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>melayu sini</malay> the standard <malay>macam</malay> lower you know then <malay>macam</malay> a lot of people like just
[dah] <malay>tak tahu pakai</malay> like they don't really speak
then also <malay>macam</malay> like some of them like don't even know how to <malay>cakap</malay> you know
so yeah [lah] then like <malay>macam</malay> a lot of like little like [ah] traditional things are like dying too
like <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>anyam ketupat</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> like
my family [ah] <malay>bila raya</malay> we still make it a thing [lah] <malay>macam</malay> every year we still do it you know and it's like
I'm not very good at it but it's like you know I like the whole
idea that we still do it then like it kind of just like it surprised me that a lot of my friends like don't
like you know they don't know how to do it
and then like sometimes also like sometimes they tell me like you know they don't even celebrate like the first day or like they don't celebrate at all then I'm like
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>sedih</malay> [ah] because it's like you know I grew up with such like memorable (err) like memory [ah] you know with a lot of like memorable stuff from the first day of <malay>raya</malay> and I feel like for me
even though like growing up like you know
holidays just like I mean like <malay>hari raya</malay> and all like becomes like less enjoyable I always enjoy getting ready you know like
the whole you know <malay>buat kuih raya</malay> and like <malay>ayam ketupat</malay> and like just like getting already getting the house like <malay>raya</malay> ready
<malay>macam</malay> best [ah] like you know but like
the fact that I know that there are malay people in this day and age like who don't do it just makes me so sad

[eh]

[ah] I've been wanting to see how it works
[oh] is that
[oh]
[ha]
you cannot like delete the profile [ah]
then what if like the person <malay>dah kahwin</malay> then <malay>lepas tu ada masih orang nak</malay> try hit on the person
<malay>menarik</malay> [oh] god

[oh] it's like didn't see [lah] cause like your <malay>apa tak nampak apa-apa pun</malay> [kan]
the thing right then they will read it was the limit of ten guys I think [oh]
[oh]
okay okay
ya that's why it's like a bit too intense for me [lah]
Muzmatch
(uh)
(mm)
[oh]
cool through half of our #deen#
ya
ya
[oh]
[oh]
[oh] my god that's nice okay set I will go for half of our #deen# instead of Muzmatch
ya international love that's the way to go
but half of our #deen# also for muslim
[oh]
serious
Muzmatch no need to pay
[oh]
interesting
[eh] then you know the Instagram what's that filter where they have their <malay>halal</malay> meter or <malay>haram</malay> meter thingy
where were where is it from I heard it's from some dating apps also was it I'm not sure
[oh] cause like someone told me one of these dating apps they have this <malay>halal haram</malay> ratio or something
so that they will match you to the right person like
I don't know what is it
do you pray [oh] okay
ya
[oh]
okay okay that's cool
interesting
but do you think you will bond to meet your significant other through a dating apps
I think
[oh]
ya
that's true
I know right
I like to observe the people first from afar
then see how is he like then I did like something that
(um) people other people opinions on that guy also affect my opinion on that guy also like for instant if people around him keep saying that [oh] my god he is such a nice person and he does this this this then I will
be like [oh] okay since like he is kind to a lot of people then he must be a nice person
ya or else
ya that's true
we have been wanting to do it just for the loves <malay>ke</malay>
to go but then I always feel bad because you like you say <malay>orang kat</malay> Muzmatch <malay>macam dia orang</malay> serious
[oh]
ya
that is so sad
ya
(hmm)
that is sad
[oh] well sometimes it works for people sometimes it does not
ya it does [oh] ya about <malay>apa yang</malay> you said
about putting themselves out there you know some people were saying that in unique
a lot of people also try their best to put themselves out there and you can see there's some people will be turned off by that right
how do you feel about that isn't that like a dating app but then <malay>macam</malay> physical
[kan] [kan] <malay>tak macam kalau dekat</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> physical physically <malay>macam</malay> desperate <malay>tapi kalau dalam</malay> dating app <malay>tak desperate ke</malay>
[ah] that is true that is true
ya
ya ya it does
clap for me
ya ya that is scary
ya
I don't know whether it is still like that is it still like that
or maybe I just turn a blind eye on it it just like
<malay>apa-apa</malay> [lah] <malay>nak buat apa-apa apa</malay> [lah] <malay>apa korang</malay> [lah]
[oh] so much [sia] on topic <malay>ini</malay>
but I think someone ask me this before
an outdoor person may I like to do outdoors things like
ya I feel like I told you this before no
I'm a outdoor person like I like to do outdoor things like
then probably an ideal date for me will be doing things somethings outdoor [lah] somethings like trekking [oh] my god I love trekking just like walking around because right
when I trek with my friends I we have we actually don't have a lot of things to do other than walking
and also like since it is quite silent sometimes you want to listen to the silence around you
and if you are trekking with your friends you will be comfortable with the silent so maybe you want to see whether there's ya comfortable with the silent with that guy
and also like (um) sometimes you also want to talk because trekking will be pretty long
so wouldn't want to stay quiet all the time so for instance if I want to go on a movie date
then I can't really talk to him I can't really get to know him right so if I was talk walking I can like
try to get to know him and like see how is he like
[ha]
tricky question don't know [eh] I feel like first date
and like subsequent dates I would want to go trekking
ya not bad not bad is that like too much
I have never dated people before so I wouldn't know what is too much
ya I feel that movie date is too much
because it's so intimate
ya and it's dark and it's scary like
what are you going to do
<malay>kadang orang gatal</malay>
you never know
ya
ya exactly
but that's like another two hours it's too long
I don't know
I don't know how long
ya
do you also want to go trekking
then what is your first date
[oh] ya that's the point though if you can't accept me at my lowest there's no reason being
[oh] okay okay sure
few months okay
[oh] ya then the first [one] [eh]
[oh] my god that's sound fun actually I always wanted to go picnic
with someone like a significant other like I don't know
paint <malay>tengah</malay> picnic [oh] my god that is so cute
[ah]
[kan] like these few days people have been picnicking a lot
ya
ya [oh] my god then like the <malay>apa</malay>
lay flat lay is it ya flat lay
!wah!
that is so cute
ya I would want to end my date with sunset
but then <malay>macam kalau</malay> the date doesn't go well I will be like bye I don't really want to share this sunset with you
so I am going to go home first but mostly that won't happen [lah]
ya
halfway halfway
like
they just went toilet
[oh] that is super rude though
[oh] then I will stand up [lah] try my best to stand up to him then like if <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia tak kisah pun</malay> like he is so obnoxious and so full of himself then I won't even bother [lah] I will just walk away
ya
does that happen often though like you people just ghost
ya
ya
wait <malay>apa tu</malay> catfish
ya I pretty sure it's not
I'm on like a dating app you pretend to be someone else
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
nineteen and this boy <malay>sudah gatal</malay>
ya
[oh]
maybe cause like he's still very young also so like I think eighteen nineteen it's pretty young so he doesn't really know what to do maybe I forgive him for doing that
because
ya like the first thing you already lie like you haven't even start anything you already lie that is so sad
I think I do <malay>cerita pasal</malay> dating apps or dating
wait <malay>cerita</malay> netflix [oh]
[oh] okay
(uh huh)
ya
[oh] okay that's so fast but that's so cute too [lah]
interesting
dating dating <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>gatal</malay>
[oh]
ya it sounds like an interesting concept
[oh]
ya
and everything because you only need the birth cert so at that point it was really a matter of
[ah]
[oh]
that's good I don't know
I don't know would you
no I don't think so
ya ya
it is important
[oh] [kan] <malay>apa ada</malay> some <malay>cerita-cerita cinta pasal</malay>
I don't know [lah] you know the malay store malaysian drama or malaysian movies
where the parents just like <malay>apa</malay> pair them pair their children up then like they their children won't know each other and and don't see each other until like the day before the engagement or something
ya isn't that like kind of the same thing also
(mm)
I used to think that I'm okay with my parents match making me but then now
nah I don't think so
[oh] I don't know I change
ya if I don't get married then it's fine [lah]
twenty five is quite early ya cause like in three years
ya [oh] my god

at first I was like [ah] I want to move out I want to buy a house
at first I was like [ah] but I I want to move out I want to buy a house but I can't really apply for right you know
ya
is it cause of the current resource
<malay>tak cukup rumah</malay>
maybe they should like create an environment that is healthy for the future generation to live in then maybe we will consider to procreate
I mean if like the view if we can see the future being so messed up and everything right now are so messed up and like the systems [a'ah] and all that
if you want to have children would you want our future generation to suffer
ya and that's the thing
nah [ah] just say they <malay>macam</malay> I wouldn't want I know that through all these <malay>apa</malay>
obstacles challenges you will go stronger [lah] and all those bullshits I was like that is such a sad life
[kan]

<malay>tak kadang dia orang akan</malay> suddenly <malay>berbual pasal</malay> the privilege that we have for example the Mendaki thing and the education stuff

ya [kan] <malay>orang-orang</malay> chinese <malay>tak faham</malay> [lah]

(uh) ya ya is like so cute
[ah] <malay>tapi ada satu macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> quite I don't I don't really like it like they have this challenge on their on their house opening I was like
what I forget already there was one challenge
<malay>entah macam ada beberapa</malay> challenge
[oh] <malay>tak</malay> there is one challenge that I like
is was like (um) calling my (um) my girlfriend or wife a third name [lah] I think that's quite cute actually I like that [one] but some other challenge <malay>macam</malay> questionable
but then so cute
ya ya
you know like I at first I don't understand like why would they feel that
way like
if like you're together don't you want to marry each other then ya
that's true
maybe I will know the feeling when I
<malay>tak tak</malay> she doesn't follow me anymore yeah <malay>tak nak kecoh</malay> [sia]
[eh] do you
do you know #adam swandi# #adam swandi#
never mind then he's a local football player
he just got married
and then his <malay>pelamin</malay> is so pretty I love it
<malay>tak dia kat</malay>
<malay>kat luar</malay> some function hall or something then my friend went to his wedding then I #kaypoh# #kaypoh# <malay>tanya dia kat mana</malay>
cause it's really very nice [oh] my god and the function hall right it was so good the venue they have a space for children like I would want that because usually
malay weddings for instance usually most of the malay weddings I've went to
<malay>takde</malay> any spaces for children then like they will just run around and like that then <malay>orang akan marah</malay> and plus like it's a safety hazard for them because like there are food around hot things around and there are just so many people and so many tables around it's not safe for them so I thought
yes if I were to get married I would want to have like a children's corner for these I think it was a brilliant idea to have a children corner
then
right if I were to have a children corner you won't see the bride on the <malay>pelamin</malay> [ah] you'll see the bride
at the children corner
I'll be there
the groom was like I don't know where's my wife help me
<malay>tu tu tu tu dia tengah main dengan budak-budak</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> dress <malay>dia lagi</malay>
that's quite funny
ya
[oh] my god I was thinking of that <malay>tetapi</malay> [kan] <malay>tetapi</malay> [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> singapore's weather doesn't really allow us to do that
(mmhmm) [oh] I would want
that <malay>macam abeh tengok</malay> sunset <malay>kalau</malay> sunset <malay>dia lawa</malay> !oof! <malay>lagi</malay> best then <malay>kita boleh tengok</malay> sunset <malay>sama-sama</malay>
like the whole family <malay>tengok sama-sama</malay>
then <malay>macam</malay> at the same time I'm scared like <malay>hujan tempias</malay> even if there's like shelter ya and confirm <malay>mahal</malay> [seh] ya would you want to spend so much
on the wedding right
[kan]
like I want a small <malay>majlis</malay> [jer]
it is
their family also like to connect each other's families
that's what I told you about like what the heck
it's just it's just funny how this
weddings how this #walimas# work
[a'ah]
<malay>tapi nanti orang sedih nanti macam</malay> <malay>baiklah</malay>
like I really hope if I end up getting married <malay>macam</malay> the
my in-laws would be nice and like not pressured
I know my family won't be nice
[oh] wells
[kan]
okay <malay>baiklah itu sahaja yang kita ada untuk hari ini sesi perbualan</malay>

so we have two toilets [lah]
okay the thing is that right when you when we went in (uh) cause we were all very sleepy already
so we just take our spot we didn't even bother to like
(err)
give any comments we only shared our experiences when we reached singapore and it's not like the next day after one week and we actually heard it from
our mothers like like I told my mum
[ah] they told their they told their my aunt
so actually my mum and my aunt shared our stories then we we went back to the WhatsApp group and like

so my cousin insisted that she wants an extra bed
so we so we called and all these we we called and then they said that (uh) [oh] (um) the bed is hundred fifty per night and all this [lah]
and then so we were like (uh) okay [lah] let's not get the bed [lah] but then my cousin was so <malay>dia</malay> she was so persistent about getting an extra bed when there's a sofa at the living room that someone can actually sleep on it
ya but
so so we were like okay [lah] we didn't think much then like just heard the biggest the bigger sister took the sofa and then we all just went to bed and then at twelve and then at twelve and then at twelve when we wanted to go for lunch
then my cousin brought it up again I want to get an extra bed
so everybody sleep in the room together
ya the same cousin that okay one of the younger [one] [lah]
so she she insisted she wanted to get extra bed
so we were like why why is she so persistent then my my sister my sister my sister offered

(uh) no okay wait no babe the story has not ended
so (uh) when my sister offered
she she was still very persistent my cousin was still very persistent no no no no everybody sleep in the room
so
so is so everybody just <malay>macam</malay> the conversation just ended there and all like okay let's go for lunch and then we drop the conversation so
at night we all went back
and then we we all went back and then
we all went back to our hotel room and then suddenly we just
<malay>kita</malay> we just like
<malay>kita</malay> just <malay>cakap</malay>
<malay>kita cakap</malay> to each other
<malay>kita cakap</malay> to each other
<malay>kita cakap</malay> to each other I I'm trying to recall the story
okay <malay>kita tengok</malay> each other (uh) let's just sleep
together
so we actually brought the entire (uh) we moved the entire bed (uh) all the mattress outside at living room imagine how big the living room is
so we moved everything out at the living room and then we just slept together for three nights
ya in in like (uh) instinct [lah] I would <malay>kita punya</malay> like our instinct were like were we were like telling each other
okay let's just sleep together
okay
so
okay <malay>kita</malay> we slept together so cause of the bathtub right
we thought of like (uh) let let's go get bath bombs
so everyone were very excited (uh) to <malay>mandi</malay>
(uh)
ya in the bath bombs
but
it was a mistake
<malay>sebab tandas tu besar</malay>
<malay>tandas tu besar</malay>
no
<malay>tak</malay> the <malay>tandas besar</malay>
okay the <malay>tandas</malay> is the size of a <malay>punya</malay> flat (uh) the room the room size the ya this room size
yes so the <malay>pintu</malay> then after that
(um)
after that is the bathtub
(um) the toilet bowl
and then there's a glass door inside for the shower
so so the bath so so is the bathtub so the shower is actually facing the glass door the the glass door is actually facing the bathtub
so can you imagine when we were when
<malay>kita mandi kita rasa macam</malay>
<malay>orang tengah tengok</malay>
<malay>tak kita semua</malay> [ah] <malay>bilik masing-masing</malay> [pe]
<malay>kita kita</malay> (uh)
okay <malay>kau sepuluh minit kau sepuluh minit aku sepuluh minit</malay>
<malay>faham tak</malay> so
I was alone in the toilet they were all outside
ya but then none of us lasted more than ten minutes
cause we we we we sense we sense something we felt something I felt it too [lah] so I decided to okay I'm I'm not doing this you know I just like like whatever I'm just gonna just
waste the money [lah] I I don't don't care it's just like what
thirty
thirty bath bombs so
(uh) that okay that was the second night when we decided to (um) buy the bath bombs and
so we all slept outside okay so fast-forward
when we went home
that night okay when we went back to singapore
I told my mum and (uh) my grandma
so so we shared [lah] (uh) you know (uh) <malay>kita macam</malay> (uh) <malay>takut macam kita masuk kita masuk bilik kita rasa lain</malay>
so my so my grandma my my <malay>nenek</malay> asked [lah] (uh) <malay>apa yang lainnya</malay>
my my my <malay>kakak</malay> my <malay>kakak cakap</malay>
[ah] <malay>bilik dia berabuk</malay>
yes
so do you know so so you you know when people say the <malay>bilik berabuk</malay>
and it's a high floor what what do you think
right
so that's what been saying [a'ah] <malay>bilik dia berabuk</malay>
[ah]
but
we didn't think much [lah] cause we were so tired we didn't want to bring it up and it make it very awkward for our for for all each other right
so okay <malay>bilik dia berabuk</malay> and then
I I can feel I can I think I said that I can feel that someone someone was staring at me (um) what I wanted I was using bath bomb then my sister also said ya she couldn't last for more than ten minutes she really wanted to quick quickly go out and then for some reason we actually felt something [lah]
so okay but none of us actually have third eyes
so <malay>kita</malay> so <malay>kita semua</malay>
(uh) <malay>diam</malay> [tau] <malay>kita semua tak</malay>
(um)
<malay>tak tak tak tak</malay>
<malay>tak tak</malay> share okay we didn't share with each other what happened so on the other side they also told they they told (uh) the same thing to <malay>dia punya</malay> to their to their family [lah]
so they also say so when we came together or during the family gathering then then we bring it up and say (um)
[eh] <malay>korang tak perasan ke bilik dia berabuk</malay>
ya
we only we only shared with okay technically we didn't share with each other we bring we we went back we we tell each other <malay>kita</malay> our own family members and then after that when my parents when my when my when my mum called her sister
when my mum called her sister then
they were like like <malay>makcik makcik makcik</malay> #kaypoh#
(mmhmm)
[eh] <malay>budak budak tu pun cakap</malay>
they all so they were like tell tell telling so
we didn't know [ah] my then my mum when when we came back from work [ah] then <malay>baru</malay> [ah]
my <malay>mak</malay> my mum said [ah] [eh] do you know that [ah] you know (um) they experienced (uh) whatever you all experience you know
then I'm like is it so we so so we so in the WhatsApp group we
so we in the WhatsApp group we said
you all got stories
and then they said ya I got ya ya we got
okay
let's meet let's meet at (um) let's meet at my <malay>umi</malay> house
so <malay>dekat rumah</malay> my <malay>umi</malay>
<malay>baru kita</malay> (uh) <malay>kongsi</malay> stories <malay>kongsi cerita</malay>
ya so and then they say okay first that's why that's why my cousin was so (um) <malay>macam</malay> very persistent (uh) to get
(uh) another bed
so that the <malay>kakak</malay> so that the sister can sleep no nobody is separated from each other
that's the whole reason
someone was supposed to sleep in the living room
yes
yes
yes
cause she actually had a history of like
(um) this this kind of thing [ah] ya so her instinct okay even though all of us
do not have third eye
(um) she is
more on her sense were much her instincts were much stronger so from the time she actually step in and she saw okay when we step in on the left it's actually (uh) on the left
it's a big mirror with (um) a shelf and actually that shelf is <malay>berabuk</malay> already but I didn't but for me <malay>berabuk</malay> is
(um)
for me <malay>berabuk</malay>
was the bed
was the mattress
I find it I'm trying to recall
okay so
okay for me it was the mattress
that was
(um) dusty
nothing else (um) was suspicious
but
to my cousins and my sister something else were
dusty
so we all see different things but overall the room was dusty
so overall [one] the room was dusty [lah]
<malay>bilik dia lain</malay>
<malay>sebab kita sebab kita</malay>
<malay>kita</malay>
<malay>sampai siang</malay>
okay technically we were like the late guests
so
I
think (uh) occupancy was
high
so they actually so they they gave us the highest floor
and okay the highest floor right okay the the the fact that the we got a high floor
we already at that point
we were like
(um) in our heart [lah] we're like
<malay>tinggi</malay> [pe] <malay>tingkat</malay>
<malay>tapi tapi</malay>
<malay>kita semua diam</malay>
<malay>kita kita semua diam sebab kita semua dah ngantuk</malay>
<malay>kita kita</malay> (uh) <malay>kita ikut</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> in <malay>tapi</malay> in (uh) <malay>dalam hati</malay> it's actually <malay>kita semua macam</malay>
(uh) this is the
first this is the first time we are getting a high floor room
ya but then we didn't think cause (uh) it was like five thirty in the morning who cares whether the room is who who cares the the room is high or low we just want our bed [ah]
so when we so so after that
so okay the continuation of the story
that was our personal experience and then
and then when and then when my cousins (uh) she we all we all went back to work
and some right
so my cousins [ah]
<malay>punya kawan tanya dia</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> (uh) best
best <malay>tak</malay>
so my cousin said (uh)
best [lah]
(uh) it was fun
but we had (uh)
we had experiences
(uh) in the hotel room
she is a malaysian
<malay>dia tanya</malay>
hotel <malay>mana</malay> hotel <malay>mana</malay> you <malay>tinggal</malay>
[oh] (uh) [oh] <malay>kita tinggal</malay> hotel <malay>ni ni ni</malay> [ah]
[oh]
you <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>itu</malay> hotel [ah]
(um) <malay>dulu</malay> [ah] <malay>saya punya bapa</malay> (uh) <malay>sudah</malay> (uh) (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay>
<malay>sembahyang</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>orang-orang</malay> (uh) <malay>orang-orang</malay>
<malay>ahli yang lain</malay> so what she was trying to say is that that hotel was known to be haunted where people actually killed themselves and know do [ah] they they hang themselves okay technically they kill themselves inside the hotel there were a lot of like scenarios in hotel so what the hotel did was
<malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>panggil</malay> (uh) <malay>ustaz</malay> buddha [ah] <malay>ahli-ahli ugama</malay>
<malay>untuk sembahyang</malay> [kan] the <malay>bilik</malay> to (uh) to <malay>sembahyang</malay> [kan] the hotel the blessed bless the hotel
yes
so they did that (um)
so so the moment she know what that she (uh) quickly met WhatsApp in the group so we also Google [lah]
luckily it came out was in twenty fourteen and we were like
I went there last I went there
this year february just nice before the lockdown
no and technically okay
and okay this was
(uh)
<malay>ni kali kedua</malay>
the first time
was with my family
but that [one] we actually (uh) my parents took the first room and then the four five of us right the the living room
technically it's not okay technically there were no living room [ah] during our time the suite the suite was different so there were no living room it's just (uh) king bed a platform a sofa bed a sofa so all of us
four five of us slept there then my parents at the (uh)
front room [lah]
so it was a different room but
maybe plus minus same size
so it were was that that was last two years with my family was last two years
this year january was with my cousins
[oh] only sixteen twenty
that (uh) definitely not more than thirty definitely not not even like
thirty
but it's a very famous hotel [seh]
speaking of <malay>orang kaya</malay>
<malay>kita tak ada jiran</malay>
[ah] okay <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>setahu kita kita takde jiran</malay>
<malay>tapi kita selalu dengar macam</malay> (uh) <malay>macam kita dengar benda</malay> [lah]
<malay>kita boleh dengar benda</malay>
<malay>tapi kita tahu kita takde jiran</malay>
okay <malay>bilik kita bilik hujung</malay>
corner corner
okay the the floor
okay the okay <malay>bilik</malay> the hotel is famous the hotel is very big
so the the the hotel very big right
(uh) the there were many sections
but we know that our area we don't have a neighbour
ya but we always hear like
(uh)
sound sound not not sounds being pushed we hear like foot we hear like (um) kids running like screaming and stuff like that
even though the
even though the door was actually far from the living room actually
we find it strange cause we said but we didn't even mention cause you know how <malay>orang orang tua cakap mulut jangan celupar bila kita dekat tempat tu</malay>
technically we we we just shut our mouth just in case we said something we we accidentally say something wrong
(uh) we couldn't be bothered [lah] cause
it's a big room and there were like five of us so our main main concern was to fit
all five of us in the room
and and and we do not want to we do not want to move move our things
<malay>leceh</malay> [seh]
okay but forty one
is was not the highest floor it was one of the highest I think it goes until fifty two
the top ten floors
<malay>kita tak kesah sebab kita malas nak</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay>
<malay>nak angkut barang-barang kita</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> okay <malay>kita dah bawa keluar semua tilam</malay>
(uh)
<malay>kat depan</malay>
so to put it back so so to put the mattress back and then we request for another room and then pack all pack all our things to the new room
like too much work [ah] we we we like (err) don't want [ah] we don't want to sign up for this kind of thing so we just like
everybody sleep in the living room
and just
stick to one another so technically we were like glue like stick to each other like a glue
ya so that was like
our experience in and we could have been to #krabi# if not cause of this COVID
[ah] it okay let me let me tell if this makes you feel better let me tell you that I'm going I'm definitely going to sleep in my sister's room tonight
we still when when we we <malay>kita</malay> share when <malay>kita kongsi</malay> story (uh) <malay>cerita ni dengan</malay> (um)
our other cousins
they were
like all five of us
can still feel the chill down our spine
yes
like three of us (uh)
three okay cause
I'm the scaredy cat kind right
I try not to pay attention to this kind of things but cause my cousins
were (uh)
saying it right
after we came back
it's like it makes me like it makes me think [lah]
[eh] ya
I I heard sound
you know I I heard noises I I heard I heard like kids
running that's why that
but to think of it
nobody goes down the emergency exit cause it's in the corner and it's a forty one floor why why why you want to go to the emergency exit
so the technically nobody would
run there and we were like in the corner it's like an L thing and we're like the we're like the horizontal [one]
so I was like and the before a long corridor
even though it's a very very famous and it's very convenient
the shopping mall is just down <malay>bawah</malay>
(err) given a choice I won't want to go back there
[ah]

<malay>macam</malay> like I'm better than you <malay>tapi</malay> actually <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] better <malay>sangat</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I more better but then actually you not that better [lah]
okay
you ask me what question you want to ask
you you
okay
<malay>kita</malay> party [lah] [sia]
I think I think right I think
I think <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>kita macam ape eh</malay>
<malay>kau tak payah kerja kalau</malay> we don't have to work right
and then
what do we do I <malay>rasa</malay> we enjoy
<malay>kita</malay> party
<malay>kita macam buat hal masing masing</malay> I think we will achieve our dreams [ah]
I think that is for sure <malay>macam</malay>
we don't need to worry about
bill bill <malay>yang nak bayar ni semua</malay>
you know
so if you don't have to work
<malay>kalau</malay> we don't have to work then don't basically <malay>macam</malay>
the only reason why we work is <malay>nak dapat duit kan</malay>
so if
we we don't need to get the money to pay our bills then
I think
we will just
<malay>buat hal masing masing [ah]
<malay>macam</malay>
we achieved our dreams like we <malay>macam</malay> finally enjoy life why what what I would say
then maybe the whole world won't be so capitalistic
yeah
consumerism consumerism
yeah
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>tak ada makna</malay> [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
<malay>macam tak ada makna</malay> meaningless [lah]
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
<malay>tak ada</malay> challenges [ah]
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh kalau</malay>
like if you drop
everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
risk
that is so true though
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I think for me
(um) I only risk
failures [lor]
[oh] I risk time
basically time [lah] I think <malay>yang</malay> the most issue for my
side is time because I feel like
<malay>macam tak cukup masa gitu</malay>
because I'm really so old you know like twenty four
<malay>abeh macam</malay>
ya but the thing is to me then then again age is subjective what people think that twenty four is like [oh] nothing but to me I <malay>rasa macam</malay> twenty four is like [oh] my god I don't have time anymore you know I have like six more years until thirty and then what am I supposed to do next I mean I <malay>kena kahwin kena beli rumah</malay>
and you need to like
like
you know you have to get your dreams in order basically [lah]
so macam like
to me the only factor that I <malay>rasa</malay> that I'm losing right that I'm risking is
failures and time because I don't think that I have the time to <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>gagal lagi</malay>
like (ugh)
it's so sad right
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya but at the same time <malay>macam</malay> they still like if to me that those are like lucky people <malay>macam dorang macam</malay>
<malay>bertuah</malay> [lah] to like you know at least hit at least find something that you know they're good at even if even on that even at that age
like even though <malay>dorang</malay> [dah] macam tua tua gitu macam</malay> forty plus <malay>tapi macam masih dapat</malay>
<malay>dapat buka</malay> apprenticeship
<malay>dapat</malay>
<malay>buat ni semua</malay> like
not everybody is that lucky I guess
(mmhmm) hard work is also another thing
(mmhmm)
but at the same time <malay>kalau asyik asyik kena</malay>
like do you think you would actually have the strength to like not give up anymore
<malay>macam</malay> like if you always like you know <malay>kalau</malay> you always work work hard <malay>je asyik asyik</malay> work hard <malay>abeh lepas itu macam</malay>
<malay>macam tak ada tak ada</malay> luck like people don't like it's just not your <malay>bidang</malay> [lah] it's not your industry
like you try so many things macam you try <malay>masak</malay> you try restaurant
retail <malay>abih</malay> you try [ah] <malay>apa lagi</malay> [ah] engineering <malay>abih lepas itu</malay>
you try hairstyling also
and then you find out that like [eh] you found nothing like everything in the world you try and that like
you don't know you <malay>nak buat apa</malay>
(mmhmm)
true [lah]
at the same time also you feel like like
(err) there's also there's always new things to discover I guess
so <malay>macam</malay> you'll never run out of things to like
explore and try
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul juga</malay> [ah] <malay>betul juga</malay> [ah]
what you say <malay>ada ada</malay> sense
if you had three wishes
what would you wish for
no but if you cannot do that
<malay>kalau</malay> you cannot <malay>minta</malay> for like more wish
okay so my first wish I <malay>rasa</malay> I would be eternally rich
I will I will ask for a never ending fortune
so I can <malay>beli</malay> anything that I want
you [eh]
ya ya ya
world peace !oof!
now you making me feel inadequate
inadequate
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
my second wish
(um)
probably that
we may be looked as equals
<malay>macam</malay> at least <malay>macam</malay> treated as human beings [lah]
at least <malay>macam</malay> in terms of salary in terms of of the will
<malay>kaum lelaki tengok kita</malay> basically I just wish for like you know equality you don't look at us as like object
yeah basically
but the thing is <malay>memang betul</malay> [lah] <malay>darjat wanita</malay> [dah] <malay>naik</malay> [kan] <malay>memang tinggi</malay> [lah] <malay>di islam tapi</malay>
<malay>entah macam kadang kadang kawan kita macam</malay>
tradition you know tradition sucks man
they suck balls
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
break out of it right like it's so hard for us to like break out of tradition because it's already been part of us for so long like since <malay>kita kecil sampai sekarang</malay> [dah] <malay>besar</malay> [pun]
<malay>kalau kita nak macam</malay> you know like <malay>cakap</malay> example like wedding my friend
like ask ask my friend was like saying that like [oh] [ah]
they are going to like make a big hotel wedding because [ah] <malay>suami dia</malay> is <malay>apa itu anak seorang</malay>
like he's the only child so
they want to <malay>buat besar besar</malay> because they are only going to have one wedding ever
<malay>so macam</malay>
<malay>kan membazir</malay> and then like to her she feels like she don't need [lah] because most of the people she won't she won't even <malay>kenal</malay>
you know
and then at the same time <malay>macam</malay> in at the same time you so you follow [lah] if you <malay>mampu ke tak betul tak</malay>
(hmm)
(mmhmm)
yeah
just the
just how society
look at us
basically [ah]
like their requirement to like [oh] for women to be considered
(uh) ideal matches to be <malay>kahwin</malay>
to be married off
and then they don't put the same on guys
must be soft spoken must be so <malay>macam</malay>
but
like girly you know you have to like
be
motherly figure
cannot cry cannot be emotional
you have to be strong
(uh huh)
society is definitely the problem
ok then your second wish
meaning
(mmhmm)
(mm)
basically you just don't want to regret
like you just want to like be confident of your choices no matter what you take no matter what you what no matter what you did
is it
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
but I think for me [leh] (uh)
so far no matter even if I had bad choices right I feel like I am generally pretty satisfied with whatever I choose [lah]
like
I mean ok like it when it comes to
my exes then that is another different story [lah]
at the same time you know I'm glad that like you know I went over there <malay>macam</malay> like
is a is a lesson to learn
yeah I like like went through whatever <malay>yang kesakitan</malay> all this <malay>nangis nangis kat sejadah ni semua macam</malay>
is at the same time <malay>macam</malay> you do have like some of this
regret <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau aku tahu aku tak pilih dia aku tak cakap</malay> yes <malay>kat dia macam</malay>
but at the same time if I didn't go through that I feel like
I wouldn't be this kind like I wouldn't be myself I wouldn't be the person that I am today
so to me I don't feel
an ounce of regret
in any of my decision so far
okay for the third wish <malay>kan</malay>
<malay>kita kena</malay> make it a fun [one]
<malay>kita kena macam</malay> as <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi macam like</malay>
like <malay>jangan</malay> serious <malay>sangat</malay> [ah]
because like that okay I think my third wish I would
[ah]
wish for
the skills of
every cook in the world
so <malay>kirakan</malay> I can <malay>masak</malay> any <malay>makanan</malay> that I want
<malay>entah</malay> [eh]
I also didn't know like it was one of my choices [lah] for me to to
right right I think so too I think I will be like but the thing one thing I don't let is to <malay>ikut</malay> recipe
I for me I don't really <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tengok</malay> recipe I look at the ingredients but I don't <malay>macam ikut one tablespoon
(uh) one
one pinch of salt all this kind of thing I <malay>tak ikut</malay>
yeah
you know I mean <malay>agak agak</malay> is like fun [leh] it's like (oo) you know you are making a portion or you like making something like [oh] it's a hit and miss like [oh] if hit
today then like okay good for you if it doesn't hit then okay then next time I know that I have to put more <malay>gula</malay> and stuff like that
frenzy it's like a it's like a trouble it's like a to me it's like <malay>macam</malay> like that time I <malay>masak sambal tumis telur</malay> [eh] <malay>sambal tumis</malay> like mixture of sausages
lobster balls meatballs <malay>dengan</malay>
sotong ball
so I literally right
<malay>buat sambal tumis tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>tak ada bawang merah tau</malay> like there's no onions
so I decided to use <malay>bawang putih</malay>
and to me because mummy <malay>kata</malay>
<malay>bawang putih</malay> is like a good alternative and also like you know <malay>bawang putih</malay> is more flavorful <malay>macam kalau</malay> you <malay>masak nasi goreng</malay> if you don't have <malay>bawang putih</malay> it's fine you can just use garlic garlic is important [lah] basically
so I use garlic and I put like five cloves of garlic and it was to me it's a bit too much [lah] because you can literally <malay>rasa</malay> the garlicky taste
and then I did <malay>macam lada kering</malay>
and all that jazz and then after that I <malay>tengah masak kan</malay>
and then I was just like I feel like <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>bawang putih punya</malay> taste <malay>macam</malay> still overpowering you know
so I <malay>letak</malay> sugar and then it was like (uh)
doesn't really hit the spot
and I try to put a sauce and I try again and it was like okay okay is kinda there
and after that I put stock because I mean makes the world go round
so I put then I put <malay>kicap</malay> and then I put (uh) it was like a it was like a frenzy [ah] it was like a
like a carnival like basically <malay>macam</malay>
I just I just whatever I can think of right I just <malay>campak kat dalam</malay>
(mmhmm)
yes imagine you ask me for <malay>rendang</malay>
I can cook any <malay>rendang</malay> you want <malay>rendang</malay> #johor# <malay>rendang</malay> #penang# <malay>rendang</malay> #sarawak#

apparently after we left after we leave the <malay>punya</malay> mall right then then I was okay already then I <malay>rasa lapar</malay> then I feel like want to eat
then my mum was like okay [lah] let's go eat <malay>dekat kedai makan yang kat bawa</malay> like some
<malay>kedai kedai kat bawa gitu</malay>
you know that I think that was like
it's not really a good thing but it's something that I remembered

but it's more of like glimpses all here and there
<malay>macam sikit sikit/malay> [lah] like
ya we don't remember the entire thing
but if it's a good memorable one right
I think
where mummy <malay>masak</malay> me birthday for my sixteenth sixteenth birthday

[oh] baby baby
good looks or fit body what would you prefer
yeah
(mm) <malay>fikir fikir</malay>
good looks
(uh huh)
yeah that's true
that's true that's true ya ya I think for a guy I will take good looks because
I mean
<malay>buat apa kalau badan macam sedap gila tapi muka macam haprak</malay>
but that at the same time if you have if your body is fit your <malay>muka haprak</malay> but then your personality is nice then okay [lah]
and if you manage to <malay>macam</malay> you know capture me with your humor then
it's fine it's fine by me
you know
topic topic <malay>perbincangan</malay>
<malay>satu jam</malay>
okay
(um)
what is your favourite colour

red
what the hell
[oh] blue is it [ah] ya blue
then I was joking
no
what the
it's not yellow
no it's not yellow baby
it's pink
what do you mean I hated pink that's not me sorry I love pink with all of my heart it's just that this year I feel like I want to use a lot of yellow
cause yellow is a good energy <malay>punya</malay>
color
it it has sunny it has a happy joy up to it I don't want any negativity
yeah
like you look at yellow then you just like [oh] you know <malay>sedap mata memandang gitu</malay>
but like
yeah I I like pink I'm I'm a pink person
unusual
(mm)
to be
able to
<malay>entah eh</malay>
how unusual is unusual
[oh] my god that's gross
(um)
[oh] I think for me is to
control my period cycle
control your period pain
like my cramps
and my power is to just like okay
today I need to feel pain so I'll be like okay pain meter let's go to a hundred
and the next time I'll be like okay today I feel like I want to chill chill a bit
so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>turun</malay> a bit the pain threshold
yeah
but sometimes you just feel like you need to feel the pain like you know you <malay>rasa macam</malay>
<malay>sedih macam sedih nak mampus gitu</malay>
my super power would be able to
manifest anything that I want from thin air
from thin air
<malay>macam</malay> like if I want a sandwich I get a sandwich if I want airpods if I want a pair of airpods I get airpod if I want a laptop I get a laptop
if I want money I get money
<malay>apa</malay>
okay what I think like what if if I want to if I want to
if I want a condo I got condo
<malay>senang sikit</malay>
the troubles that comes through
that comes through
and resale and <malay>kahwin</malay> everything
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] you don't have to worry
I just think about it and is there I want it I got it I want it I got it
you [eh]
why
without what
why
<malay>nanti</malay> what if you <malay>jadi</malay> pervert <malay>ke apa</malay>
I mean true what if you don't want to be if you don't want if you want to go to places that people I mean isn't that like
something perverts would ask for
ya like
I think right if I have the power of invisibility right I will probably like look at people
like my greatest enemies right and then see what they're doing and then <malay>macam</malay> blackmail them
(oo) that's true I'm like you die today
[oh] my god yes
you die today
today you shall live
I shall not kill you

avatar #Aang# #Aang# #Aang#
<malay>entah dia macam merepek</malay> [ah]
<malay>dia macam world</malay> [ah] I guess
to me dia <malay>macam</malay> world <malay>sikit</malay> [ah]
ya <malay>dia macam tak</malay> serious come on man you are the avatar man
you have the ability to control all four like
[oh] maybe I'll choose #toph# also
#toph#
ya the earth the earth girl the blind [one] her jokes everytime
her joke she's just like [eh] see and then it be like [eh] what I don't say anything then she's like ya
exactly
like her jokes are like one of a kind [lah] [seh] like

I need to rewatch the entire series because I am reading a lot of theories [eh] I don't understand
I mean I understand [lah] but like I want to like watch it and like be obsessed with it
tomorrow what are you doing
tomorrow is sunday what are you gonna do
you got some work to do
(oo)
ya same
same with me
!huh!
I <malay>rasa tak keluar tak tau ah</malay>
I think so
yeah definitely we have to do my work I have to re-upload my
I re-uploaded my first two decks already I'm working on my third deck
for so <malay>macam tinggal</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> monday I have to like upload
(err) five more
and I'm way behind to be honest
(mm)
I mean <malay>macam</malay> I have a lot of pages a lot of a lot of development which is good but I'm technically in terms of the number of decks that have I'm far behind and I have two more weeks to complete fifteen decks
and I'm only at deck three
everybody else <malay>dorang tak macam</malay> explore <malay>tau dorang macam</malay> just do one that one that one that one that one that so <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know how they can just like not explore [lah] I I like exploring I like to <malay>macam</malay>
yeah I like to <malay>macam</malay>
if I see something I want to develop a bit more and more and more <malay>macam</malay> you know let it let it branch out
I see it so it's gonna be this if I see this it's gonna be this so <malay>macam</malay>
it's a bit hard for me I guess
yup
cause it's sunday <malay>kan</malay>
tomorrow's national day
happy birthday Singapore
<malay>majulah Singapura</malay>
but I feel like this year <malay>macam</malay> I don't think they they should actually have
national day [seh]
exactly
ya the idea is just
<malay>merepek ah</malay> like who comes up with this stuff
like
like who would be appreciative of
hearing jet planes flying over
ya like are you dumb or you dumb like
fathom how dumb that idea is
it's so stupid
<malay>otak letak kat juboh</malay>
ya but at the same time and then like you you then <malay>dorang kata dorang nak</malay> do salute [eh] for nurses
ya but hello raise their pay
yeah they deserve more I mean like
instead of just
claps and you know singing home and then like bonus <malay>macam</malay> at least just increase their pay for throughout their career
cause I believe our healthcare system like earns a lot of money
especially nurses
yeah
exactly
worst [eh]
[oh] my god
[ah] vegetables
you know I don't like vegetables what are you on
#taugeh#
I think my my answer would be #taugeh# the worst thing to have buy one get one free is #taugeh#
I mean
why would anybody want more #taugeh#
like
that whole idea is just
<malay>tak masuk akal</malay>
!huh!
[oh] my god
[oh] my god
[oh] my god
!wah! she power [seh]
no I don't think I'll become that kind of mother
hello I eat a lot okay
I eat fried potatoes
potatoes
!hey! I eat baby carrots
I eat lettuce
ya ya then I mean they're not raw or they are already cook is just that
you know
ya <malay>macam</malay> sausage all this <malay>kena potong potong kadang kadang pun</malay> I <malay>macam makan</malay>
like you cut right than you just sneak in a few slices
and that's what I will do
that's what I will do
[oh] my god I feel like eating corn beef you know corn beef
yeah yeah yeah
<malay>sedap kan</malay>
[a'ah] [seh]
ya but I guess I mean we're here for a good time not a long time
I mean that's my motto here for a good time not a long time so I'm just gonna enjoy whatever I have
whatever I can get whatever I can eat and not worry about the what not worry about the
percussion
repercussion
isn't percussion like a a music instrument
!oops!
<malay>bodoh</malay>
ya repercussions later yes like diabetes or something like that I mean like I won't eat so sweet [lah]
what do you think about bubble tea
can you do you think you can live without bubble tea
a need
ya to me also like I can like live without bubble tea
[ah] actually also it's been like
two weeks since I had my KOI ovaltine macchiato
bubble tea
[oh] damn that was long
yeah I wanna eat
now I feel like drinking
yah
you weirdo
you need at least one bubble tea a month
that's fine
okay [lah] is it bubble tea or <malay>macam</malay> Boost
<malay>kan</malay> I think so I also prefer Boost
yeah especially the gym junkie cause you got protein
I like the protein
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
ya [lah] cause of the protein
I think this is where my extra mass also come from
but you know sometimes I like to just buy the kid size
because like I feel like the original is too much
ya then sometimes you just feel like like example <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>pergi</malay> interview that time I <malay>gi</malay> interview then after that I just
want to buy boost tapi I don't want so big because I want to go for the interview but I want something small enough to like
drink it so I bought the kids one
and it was so nice it was so cute I like cute stuff
okay baby I think I want to sleep
!yay!
okay bye [lah]
bye

okay I start
(err) my name #azmirul# I'm from singapore poly <malay>sekarang sekolah</malay>
year two marine engineering
you wanna talk about <malay>kita punya</malay> singapore poly life [lah] so far
how is it going
so for me and
<malay>aku rasa aku rasa</malay>
<malay>sekarang boleh</malay> manage [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like last time when I first entered <malay>aku</malay> really <malay>tak minat</malay> the course
so it was kind of <malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk aku</malay>
how about you
okay
[oh] <malay>pasal dulu</malay> my first few choices was (uh) business business finance <malay>abeh aku minat</malay> tourism
so I put there only my first six choice [ah] then my marine engineering was <malay>aku nya tujuh ke lapan</malay> [ah]
I not sure but yes [ah] <malay>aku aku tak minat tapi</malay>
<malay>aku nya</malay> points also don't give me any chance to go anywhere so <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>kena taruk</malay> the <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>kena taruk</malay> any course that I can put [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> along the way #alhamdulillah#
<malay>aku minat</malay> [ah] <malay>aku minat</malay>
<malay>aku minat</malay> [ah] <malay>aku minat</malay> marine engineering <malay>nya</malay> module
and I'm doing quite okay in it [lah]
(mm)
doing okay
so <malay>kau apa sekarang</malay> [lah] like what are you doing in school what are your activities
[oh]
<malay>aku</malay> in <malay>dikir barat</malay> [ah] as you know
I I always tried to pull you in <malay>dikir barat masuk dikir barat tapi kau tak nak masuk</malay> so
now I really want to know the reason why <malay>kau tak nak masuk dikir barat</malay>
okay [lah] <malay>boleh boleh</malay>
#muay thai# <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>bukannya</malay> #muay thai# <malay>nanti</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> stage fright <malay>ke</malay> like <malay>macam ada</malay> spectators <malay>tengok</malay>
is like to win [lah] is like to
is like not to impress the audience but to do it for yourself [lah]
right <malay>faham faham</malay> I understand
so actually our poly life quite stale
because <malay>sekarang pun</malay> COVID
then like <malay>kita lima hari</malay> five days of school but we only come to school three days four days
then <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
so really boring nowadays
so how's your secondary school life
introvert [ah]
studying
<malay>sama juga</malay> I went through the same process only that I wasn't an introvert from the start I create trouble almost all the time in secondary school
in secondary school especially in my
in my <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) younger days [ah] my sec one sec two <malay>menengah satu menengah dua</malay> that kind so I
<malay>banyak masalah dulu dengan cikgu</malay>
every month <malay>bapa kena</malay> call down until I was about sec three ya that was I realise <malay>yang</malay>
I can't be doing it because I almost retained
so that's when <malay>aku sedar</malay> [lah] that I have to bulk up <malay>kalau tak memang aku takleh</malay> survive N or O levels
that's when N levels I did well
I did get twelve points [ah] <malay>takleh</malay>
but
I doubt all the teachers wrong [ah]
so basically then I went to sec five
I got
a decent decent decent grades for all my subject <malay>yang aku ambil</malay>
then <malay>aku</malay> end up in poly now
ya what is the most <malay>macam</malay>
what is the most naughty thing <malay>yang kau pernah buat</malay> secondary school
seems quite introvert and the most <malay>yang paling</malay>
[oh]
<malay>paling mahal</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
so <malay>kira</malay> [kan] self self nominate <malay>kau terus masuk</malay>
actually talking about <malay>yang</malay> student student council student leader and
<malay>dulu</malay> like what you said I was very naughty <malay>nakal gila</malay>
so when I was in sec three the the way teacher ask me to not be naughty is appointing me to be chairperson of the class
so is the only way
that I have to tone down all my nonsense in class
<malay>macam apa aku buat semua aku kena</malay> tone down <malay>pasal aku</malay> chairperson of the class and my school <malay>dorang ada selalu macam</malay> best chairperson
best leader best <malay>apa</malay> so I was like
I cannot I cannot be last [lah] basically <malay>macam</malay> in the rankings so <malay>macam</malay> sec three <malay>tu memang</malay> quite tough [lah] is like I'm still naughty
but end up <malay>nanti cikgu jalan</malay>
<malay>dekat lorong angkat buku aku tolong</malay> [ah] I go <malay>angkat</malay>
teacher you need help [ah] then <malay>aku angkat aku angkat</malay> [kan] <malay>masuk</malay> staffroom
so <malay>kira</malay> like that was one of the worst because I didn't want student leader at all but I got it so <malay>aku</malay> just suck it up [lah]
then after that I think
I used to be a sports leader then I was the I was below the head [lah] I was vice I was vice head for the sport leader last time
and my teachers in sports leaders <malay>suka aku</malay>
<malay>pasal aku</malay> not the quiet type
but students leader <malay>punya cikgu tak suka aku pasal dia rasa aku</malay> naughty <malay>sangat</malay> so there's there's two ways that
goes around the school [lah] <malay>tu yang aku tak berapa suka pasal cikgu nanti ada</malay> different opinion about the same person
ya
that's that's being naughty [lah] <malay>dekat sekolah</malay>
ya
[oh] <malay>kira tu</malay> naughty [ah] [kan]
<malay>kira tu</malay> naughty [ah] [kan]
<malay>tu bikin kau paling</malay> guilty [ah] [kan]
guilty <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
<malay>jadi cikgu tertipu</malay> [kan]
they love it too much [lah] they think you can they can
you can hold on to you [ah]
I think because you are one of the nicest guys in the environment you are in
so <malay>macam dorang dah</malay> bless [ah]
so <malay>lepas</malay> O level after N level
you got work as in got work part time <malay>ke</malay>
burger king
(mm)
I basically after N levels
<malay>aku kerja yang kau tahu</malay> volunteer volunteer <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>yang nampak dekat</malay> (uh) fast jobs <malay>nanti dia cakap</malay> [oh] you volunteer for this run you get fifty dollar allowance [ah] <malay>kira</malay> that time too is big money for me know so <malay>kadang-kadang kalau ada</malay> shape run colour run or standard chartered I would just go for the volunteer
free shirt free meal free money so I just go
that was my basically <malay>aku nya</malay> work for my whole N level till when I go sec five [ah]
so <malay>aku akan kerja</malay> all the way
then basically nothing much [ah] <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>kerja dengan members dengan kawan-kawan</malay> with all my friends then after that after my O levels I started working properly I also work same F&B but not burger king staff
I work there and it was a good experience [lah] it was a good two months
experience <malay>aku pernah</malay> [tau] <malay>sekali kerja</malay>
I work there for about
I work there the whole month I only have three off days
<malay>tiga hari</malay> [jer] off day <malay>aku nya gaji</malay> at that point of time was
going at seven fifty per hour and <malay>satu bulan aku dapat satu ribu lapan ratus</malay>
<malay>selepas</malay> minus
that's how much I work because you have nobody to juggle the stuff give me outlet
so if anybody interested join staff <malay>masuk</malay> [lah] ya so
irony but I do have some problems [lah] I do have some problems over there in terms of how I can click with the people because usually <malay>orang-orang yang kita kerja kat luar tu tak sama</malay> age
don't have the same (uh) mentality as us
the same <malay>pemikiran</malay> [lah] basically so <malay>aku</malay> just
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tahan</malay> for two months then <malay>aku</malay> just took adapt <malay>aku</malay> just try to adapt to the situation [lah] <malay>yang aku aku</malay> was in
then ya I made a few friends malaysian friends
malaysian people you got malaysian
people or not that you work with
they are the best they are the best people to work with so friendly <malay>baik gila</malay>
yup yes correct
and some more nowadays COVID they can't go back to malaysia so they have to rent the houses here
ya they have to to keep to what let's say shampoos necessities <malay>semua dorang kena beli</malay> then they have to keep at home
so it's a tough time [ah] for them and they are still working doubly hard triply hard in singapore
!wah! salute [ah] <malay>dorang</malay>
ya
after staff day nope
I don't <malay>dah</malay>
<malay>tak kerja</malay>
yes how how about you after burger king was McDonald's [what]
the group [mah]
(mm)
okay that was that was fast
like photographer [ah]
<malay>tolong orang ambil gambar</malay>
[oh]
okay that's that's like one hour ten dollars one hour eleven dollars
[oh] is not always the <malay>sama</malay> part [lah]
park
but do you agree or not that F&B pays the least
but you have the best fun
like <malay>macam</malay>
how to say [eh]
as in <malay>aku prefer</malay> [tau] honestly <malay>aku</malay> would prefer a busy
a busy working environment <malay>pasal</malay> at least <malay>aku ada benda</malay> [tau] <malay>nak buat</malay> like something to do <malay>kalau</malay> they never come and visit they never come and buy your stuff you feel like you more tired and the time go slower
my opinion [ah]
and these courses you need to be independent nobody can spoon feed
<malay>macam benda ni semua</malay> I can see <malay>cikgu kita</malay> are harsh in some ways but they are also training us to be <malay>macam</malay> very independent because in the future <malay>semua benda-benda</malay> engineering <malay>ni semua</malay>
<malay>dorang dah ajar</malay>
you apply yourself
they won't <malay>hari-hari tengok kau buat</malay>
they would expect you to know how to do and all
that's why <malay>macam</malay> I feel engineering early brush you [lah] and if you you are not focus in the course you will really flop [ah]
<malay>macam betul-betul</malay> flop then <malay>susah</malay> once you know once <malay>dah jatuh</malay> in poly <malay>susah nak naik balik</malay>
very hard to reach the top back
ya
internship correct you go sailing you're going sailing
so you are second semester run
<malay>aku masuk</malay> shore which is first first semester so right after this semester <malay>aku</malay> probably has a month's break then after that <malay>aku dah kena masuk</malay> intern [lah]
ya
I don't know how many weeks I think thirty six
okay fun story the reason why I put marine as my seventh or eighth choice was
because I was intrigued
by <malay>dia punya</malay> sailing
<malay>aku nak belayar</malay> basically I just want to go
explore countries <malay>negara semua negara</malay> england <malay>semua</malay> whatever [lah]
(uh) <malay>yang ada</malay> ports <malay>semua</malay> [kan] saudi arabia <malay>ke</malay> whatever
so <malay>aku memang aku memang tahu yang kalau nak</malay>
<malay>dapat</malay> sailing results must be very strong
because it's the top few [ah] from what I know [lah] from my past experience for my friends that tell me and all that
so <malay>aku</malay> legit work very hard
<malay>untuk aku</malay> year one year two <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>rezeki tak ada aku tak dapat</malay>
I never get into sailing that's when I got very very disappointed
but
<malay>aku punya</malay> type is <malay>aku tak suka lawan dengan takdir</malay> [ah]
so I just follow the flow
so at the end of the day <malay>aku</malay> don't mind shore <malay>kalau dapat</malay> keppel okay [lor]
<malay>kira</malay> very good [orh] keppel
then ya [lah] I'm still okay with it ya so how about you
(mm)
ya <malay>betul</malay>
but ya [lah] you so you are willing [lah] <malay>kau kira</malay> willing <malay>untuk</malay> sail every year six months
to make it as your career
time <malay>kau balik pun dah penat</malay>
(mm)
correct agree
so your ultimate goal is to get <malay>macam</malay>
the highest type of engineer which is chief engineer then you just work shore [lah]
ya that's your plan I think that sounds like a good plan [ah]
<malay>pasal</malay> you are not away from your family too long
but you're grinding your first few years
when when you just start working
good plan actually
you can cool down [lah]
surveyor <malay>macam benda</malay> relax [ah]
ya
yup but honestly
okay [ah] during during circuit breaker and all we all <malay>semua</malay> stuck <malay>dekat rumah</malay>
so I've been watching a lot of youtube videos
and that's when I I fall in love with biomedical
<malay>pelik</malay> but yes <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> found a love from
karma medic [lah] <malay>nama</malay> youtube channel
and <malay>aku suka</malay> biomedical from there so I did more research on it
fun fact during secondary school I took physics but all my physics class I never go you know where I go I go inside bio class <malay>duduk belakang dengar</malay>
that's how much I love bio last time
but ya the love come back and I feel like <malay>kalau</malay> I do well in my poly get the highest that I could
I can probably try for biomedical engineering when I go uni <malay>ke apa</malay>
ya so talking about uni <malay>kita belum lagi lepas</malay>
so is not over yet for us
so
where do you plan to go where do you think you'll end up
you want green green
why
<malay>wayang</malay> [ah]
annoying
<malay>kacau-kacau</malay>
like what could you do when you're at the age of eight like what's the worst
all my books
stomp they will just stare at you
yup understand
(mm)
I want I want the police I want navy first okay
because navy is just fun [lah] I mean
I I watch a lot of [ah] boys to men [ah] so I find the navy part the best [ah]
so [ah] the frogmen one <malay>tu yang paling gerek</malay> [ah]
so <malay>aku nak masuk</malay> navy <malay>tapi aku tahu</malay>
<malay>aku tahu tak</malay> probably <malay>tak ada</malay> chance [lah] <malay>masuk</malay> navy [kan]
<malay>ada</malay> chance will be slim
but yes [ah] so <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>tak aku nak</malay> try my best to go police
<malay>kalau</malay> police <malay>pun</malay>
I really hope
because right now I'm overweight so
<malay>aku kena</malay> train <malay>banyak</malay> so definitely I got a feeling that would be PES
got highly likely [lah]
PES PES B pending so I hope to go to the normal PES after I finish my I pass my
then after that I hope I can go to [ah]
special operations command
<malay>kalau tak pun</malay> I don't mind
[eh] <malay>pula</malay> I don't mind civil defense
because I wanna be firefighter
ya so I don't mind police navy and
police navy and (uh)
[ah] firefighter civil defense
but I mind air force because I'm scared of heights
like I cannot take it I cannot I just cannot I take aeroplane once in my life [hor]
<malay>tu pun pergi</malay> [tau] <malay>sampai berapa tiga puluh minit dah sampai</malay>
so ya air force is a no no
bungee jump is a no no
but I got feeling I need to go because I will be the first [leh]
my father never go so <malay>aku rasa</malay> I'll be the first to enter so I think I know always the first person will always <malay>kena hijau</malay> from the trend [lah] that's what they say [lah] but no <malay>hijau</malay> for me because secondary school I was in
and find it boring [lah] my opinion <malay>macam gitu-gitu</malay> [jer] ya okay [lah] <malay>tengok macam mana</malay>
will definitely be will definitely glow up [lah] after
confirm puff
blow up
yes
correct
yes correct so
I mean the
I mean the
honestly I I don't I don't fancy
<malay>tapi kalau aku dapat</malay> air force who wouldn't take it
who wouldn't take it
I will take it
and it's like we have to take it we have no choice but to take it
ya so
ya I don't fancy it but I don't mind it so let's say you put me in engineering or communications I'm okay
ya even if I get what intelligence
!chey! !wah! <malay>pandai</malay> [seh] <malay>tak</malay> [ah] intelligence
I don't think got chance [ah]
intelligence
talk [eh]
four hours
quick maths [ah]
okay
<malay>susah dok</malay>
it was okay
what was your score though they never tell you <malay>tak bilang</malay>
but how do you think you did though was it like okay did you find it difficult <malay>ke apa</malay>
so now you're not in under any scholarship or
whatever no you're just
you just want to end the diploma [lah] there's normally
consider
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>ke dah dah minat nak</malay> sign on
pilot I heard they need to be of certain height and a certain in weight and a certain eye eyesight
<malay>kena berapa bagus</malay> !wow!
<malay>ada</malay> size <malay>dia</malay> [ah]
okay
it's kinda cool though
(mm)
primary school
<malay>sekarang berapa</malay> years
<malay>masih</malay> [eh] <malay>masih sama aku ingat sekarang dah tiga tahun</malay> [jer] primary school
(mm)
is like our one of our longest [ah]
yes correct
is who you want to shape to be [ah]
<malay>bila</malay> primary school [kan] <malay>nanti</malay>
who's your idol who's your idol don't remember confirm
<malay>nanti kita tengok</malay> movie movie who's your idol who's your idol who do you like
that kind of thing you so from there <malay>kita semua dah</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> basically know the type of person you want to be like (err) like for me last time when I was in primary school
one of the first <malay>macam</malay> entertainment <malay>punya</malay> movie show [kan] was [ah]
wrestling
so I really look up to them [ah]
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I didn't realise [tau] <malay>yang itu semua watak</malay>
as in <malay>tu semua bohong macam bedek tu semua</malay> just <malay>rekaan</malay> [tau] I didn't know
then I thought <malay>macam</malay> okay let's say <malay>macam dulu</malay> undertaker <malay>betul-betul</malay> [lah] <malay>dia jahat betul-betul</malay> [lah] <malay>dia nak nak nak menang</malay> [jer] <malay>nak kasi orang sakit</malay>
so I like their character [ah]
so I like the character so everytime I come school I try to walk like <malay>macam</malay> undertaker
<malay>buat mata dia yang</malay> roll eyes back
so <malay>kira macam</malay> last time primary school was one of the best times because
<malay>kita</malay> explore [ah]
<malay>kita</malay> explore <malay>banyak benda</malay>
<malay>satu hari kita</malay> undertaker the next day we john cena the next day #yuka civi#
ya that was that was fun days [ah]
ya in primary school also <malay>dulu kita suka buat banyak</malay> parkour
do you do parkour in school it's like normal [lah] primary school do parkour
ya was the was the peak [ah]
yes
(mm)
(mm)
okay
[oh]
so you have been leading all the way [lah] you have been leading the lines [lah]
discipline
(mm)
okay correct me if I'm wrong the right side is
feeder
the right side
the the centre is
#tekong# the left side is striker
[oh]
left-legged or right-legged
okay
so what what's your best position
striker <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>bebas</malay>
<malay>bebas</malay> like horse kick right
have you ever heard of queenstown primary school though
<malay>sepak takraw</malay>
they were national team player [ah] after they finish
secondary school
yup
but they are both from primary queenstown primary
ya
have you ever win the finals <malay>pernah menang</malay>
<malay>selalu kalah dengan siapa</malay>
who's your bogey team [ah] <malay>macam selalu jumpa dorang mesti</malay>
<malay>kalah punya</malay>
#junyuan# #tampines# located around #tampines# [kan]
#junyuan#
who did you lost to in the finals
okay
okay
yes
ninety ninety plus [lah]
pressure [lah]
so it's best three best to three basically
disappointed
<malay>sedih</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you felt just dropping on your shoulders like suddenly
you never go this far [lah]
!woo! amazing story
for me <malay>kalau bab-bab</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> <malay>atau</malay> activity [kan]
I don't really have much luck [lah]
in it because when I was in primary school I was in football
I was goalkeeper you know you know when <malay>kau penjaga gawang</malay> in primary school
you will always be blamed
if the goals you concede so we basically second round <malay>kita dah keluar</malay> everytime
<malay>kita masuk</malay> south zone <malay>kita keluar kita</malay> group stages
then secondary school I was in so <malay>kau tahu</malay> <malay>ada banyak</malay>
[lah] <malay>yang joget-joget sambil</malay> marching
to our highest position that we ever got
in #gan eng seng# secondary school was seventh
and that was from my batch
so my batch got the highest ever which is seventh
seventh out of about sixteen schools
that makes us (err) (err) the
the the drop dead centre [lah]
then when I go so basically no luck [lah] I go delta league also I play under my school name
(uh) and that [one] second round also out delta league is a league whereby the police
[ah] make the police create the league <malay>untuk macam orang-orang tak</malay>
<malay>buat buat kerja nakal macam</malay>
<malay>dadah</malay>
under age smoking
so the police made this association made this league
<malay>untuk</malay> all the <malay>budak melayu</malay> not only <malay>budak melayu</malay> [lah] <malay>budak melayu budak cina</malay> there are all types of races to come as a team to play football
for a prize
so I entered that under my school name with all my classmates with all my schoolmates my juniors and seniors <malay>semua masuk</malay>
<malay>tu pun</malay> second round <malay>kita</malay> out
then when I goes poly
I join <malay>dikir barat</malay>
I join <malay>dikir barat</malay> and my first ever performance
we got second last
and that was also disappointed disappointing for me [lah] it was normal for the rest
but it was the first time for me
so of course after the performance <malay>aku nangis</malay> [siol]
<malay>aku nangis</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> really my heart was pouring [ah]
but I see all my seniors they're laughing
so that that was when my mood for <malay>dikir</malay> honestly
like
go down [ah]
but
but because I'm the type of guy whereby
I need to see change
because if I love something
and I see the thing is going wrongly
or doing things the wrong way
<malay>aku kena aku kena</malay> step in to change
but then I know there's somebody else better than me that can do that can change the to be a better one
so when I entered in second year
(um) this my biggest accomplishment so far in all my in all my life as in school life is when they appointed me as captain
for <malay>dikir barat</malay>
they they appointed me as captain and
I didn't it's not I didn't want to take it but my parents <malay>ragu-ragu</malay> [ah]
my parents will think [eh] <malay>macam mana aku nya anak nya</malay> results
<malay>sekolah pelajaran akan</malay> jeopardise <malay>ke tak</malay>
that kind of thing so <malay>aku pun macam</malay> second guess [ah] <malay>aku</malay> second guess but I love <malay>dikir barat</malay> so much
and I look at how rich our history
in <malay>dikir barat</malay> twenty eleven champion twenty twelve champion twenty thirteen fifth twenty fourteen first
twenty fifteen seventh twenty sixteen second twenty seventeen last twenty eighteen second last twenty nineteen second last
twenty twenty fourth which is this year
this year finally we got fourth
after twenty sixteen after four years
since second we got our best position which is fourth
and I'm very happy with my team
like that's the biggest accomplishment but I never ever felt the podium kind of
the podium kind of accomplishment something that you never face before like <malay>macam nama</malay> engraved <malay>dekat dekat kau nya</malay> trophy I also never had the recognition of
<malay>pemenang dikir barat</malay> singapore poly never had that kind of recognition so but I feel like being a captain itself
and leading the team is really like an accomplishment
it's a heavy responsibility <malay>tapi</malay> we have fun doing it right like it's fun leading and it's fun
<malay>macam</malay> teaching
because it just give a lot of motivation when
you and your friend you teaching your friend rather than coach teaching a friend
you know because sometimes
your <malay>kawan takkan</malay> [eh] coach <malay>pasal</malay> they coach <malay>kau marah dia tapi kau</malay> as a <malay>kawan kau</malay> still <malay>tolong</malay> that kind of thing
ya so I guess
we have our ups and downs <malay>juga</malay> [ah]
both of us ya
wee sweet sweet
ya that that that's very demotivating is like
<malay>kau</malay> cannot
you
you will not succeed
<malay>kalau kau</malay> always feel that you are at the bottom
you know
at least something know
<malay>dah kita dah</malay> improve at least be happy about it <malay>jangan cakap</malay> !yay! <malay>tak</malay> last
how how would that be
how would that be happy for everyone when everyone is celebrating that we at least got fourth
it's very hard for a to rump up fourth though
and read up on fourth just one below third
you know
yes
the change the journey [lah] how they get fourth how they get fourth don't celebrate the fourth because we are not there yet but celebrate how do we get there
that that that <malay>pada aku tu yang paling penting</malay> [ah] <malay>dalam</malay>
<malay>dalam</malay> inner change
because to see change you also have to change
you can't keep thinking of [eh] <malay>kita dulu</malay> last
we are everytime at the bottom we must think that some someday we can be as good as
we must be up there
you know
but ya [lah] it's all good now
then now hopefully in the future we can
do more things and improve further [lah]
ya so talking about how sweet you are to me
how's
like do you have any love life how's your love life
(mm) love life
as in <malay>berbual macam</malay> single <malay>ke</malay> attached <malay>ke</malay> seeing someone

ya
embarrassed [kan] ya <malay>aku pun</malay> I felt so <malay>malu</malay> because of that
ya because you know the that thing actually happened to me literally down your block
that time <malay>aku</malay> remember that I told you the story
like that time I was down your block I saw this girl <malay>pakai tudung</malay> exactly same as you

(err) I <malay>aku aku</malay> not mad at you <malay>aku</malay> mad at the situation because <malay>aku</malay> was so embarrassed <malay>aku malu gila</malay> I was down the block
and then
I saw (uh) cause it was at night <malay>malam-malam</malay> so <malay>aku</malay> saw this lady
she was wearing her <malay>tudung</malay> and she was in the dark
<malay>dia dalam gelap</malay>
it was you so I gave the biggest
wave <malay>paling besar di dalam dunia</malay> like literally like this
and then she just stared at me so I felt something was off
<malay>macam tak kena gitu</malay> situation <malay>gitu</malay>
so I was like okay maybe I should just continue waving
and she just stared at me and she just did her stuff so I'm like okay that is not #huda#
that if you lived at me then I would just like have stood there and not like
I don't know I thought you I don't know cause I look up to like ya

ya
but the thing is #mala# at causeway point <malay>macam mahal gila</malay>
I don't know if it's <malay>mahal gila</malay> [eh]
no <malay>tapi</malay> (um) I told #amira# then I (um) (err) <malay>apa</malay> #jaz#
#jaz# she ate it it was like seven dollar per person cause <malay>dia tak makan</malay> the <malay>daging semua</malay> the <malay>daging</malay> is a mistake
who eats the <malay>daging</malay> you just go for the
that doesn't count as <malay>daging</malay> that counts as one of those processed meat <malay>macam</malay> spam <malay>daging</malay> is like literally <malay>daging yang macam masak tu</malay>
during common (mm)
(mm)
of course it's gonna be <malay>mahal</malay> it's like duck meat (err)
remember duck meat <malay>punya</malay> #ramen# that we ate at the <malay>apa</malay>
I was asking my <malay>bapa</malay> cause he was like asking like suggestions to eat and I was like [oh] can I suggest then I was like [oh] can we eat at the #ramen# and then he was like (err) I'll think about it then we never eat

tak
cause (err)
he was taking suggestions and then I was like assuming like [oh] it's an activity we gotta go then the next day I was like waiting for him to like invite us out and then he didn't say anything
(mmhmm)
#ramen# is like a top
like
it was good
ya why you don't like it
what you order [ah]

<malay>tadi tadi macam</malay> like on a you're still on the ground <malay>tapi ni</malay> a bit like floating
ya floating
(mmhmm)
but like ya that sounds like a plan [ah]
you I thought your mum <malay>ada</malay> your mum <malay>kasi</malay>
or I thought she was the one <malay>yang ada</malay> attachment <malay>punya</malay> issues <malay>dengan kau</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> like my <malay>kawan</malay> #elisa#
<malay>dia pun</malay> like thinking of
#elisa# (uh)
<malay>yang</malay> half malay half chinese <malay>yang</malay> whose in my classmate
[oh] <malay>tu tahu</malay> okay (um) #elisa# <malay>dia selalu kata</malay> but to her ma <malay>yang</malay> [oh]
ma one day I might want to go to like overseas or like migrate and then she's then cause she's like the youngest one and then all her <malay>kakak</malay> is like big
age gap
(mm)
so <malay>dia mak dia selalu</malay> like [oh] then I'll come with you [lah] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
so like
ya
so it's a bit like she said she was a bit like worried
not worried like I think it was a bit like
scared cause she knew that she could like never leave like the nest
cause <malay>mak dia</malay> is quite to <malay>tua</malay> [lah] ya
I mean ya [lah]
ya
ya ya
she's like super smart so she could like probably like get a scholarship and sweep it off her feet because
that's why she works like so (uh) hard [lah] because she knows that her position is like not
I think she has a four point O I think [ah]
no but if you have the four point [oh] it'll be known door because usually that
why [ah]
(uh) I don't think my
(uh)
she gets like (uh) awards [lah] she's always like the top two because (err) my friend daphne she has a four point O which I didn't know until
ya
why you so
ya ya ya
because I didn't know until like she posted on Twitter she was like [oh] guys I need to maintain my four point O like on for my intern
and she said it okay okay she did [lah] it wasn't kinda like show off show #offy# <malay>punya</malay> manner
so <malay>aku</malay> then I was like <malay>aku macam</malay> shocked because I didn't know this also like it makes sense [lah] because she's also like super smart
my course is so filled with so many smart people <malay>aku macam</malay> so intimidated
ya
grades
no no no no no
it's (uh) sometimes no no we're not competitive that's not like the that's just not our culture [lah] our <malay>punya</malay> course <malay>punya</malay> culture like no one is like
no one's like (uh) out there to get one another we're because we're such like a
we're like so <malay>sikit</malay>
<malay>punya orang</malay> if we like make enemies then the ecosystem will like break you get what I mean
<malay>kau punya</malay> course <malay>banyak orang</malay> y'all make enemies you won't you can just like
avoid
<malay>tak tahu</malay> (err) but I think she's still going for the
arts and business management route [lah] but I don't know what she's gonna do
but she has her whole life figured out [tau] cause like
she was telling me like
all these and then she was telling about how how her whole friend group
<malay>apa macam</malay> plan like have like one whole like plan for like <malay>dorang punya</malay> rest of their lives
ya [lah] like
after poly <malay>dorang gi</malay> university then after that <malay>apa kerja sikit</malay> then
like
get married like it was more like detailed than what what I'm trying to say
ya
so like whenever I'm with her <malay>aku macam</malay> like intimidated <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab aku selalu</malay> [kan] <malay>aku ada</malay> going with the flow <malay>punya</malay> attitude
but I know what I want to like but at least like luckily I got like what I want to do [lah] I think it's my intern [lah] you were right what you were saying <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>kau punya</malay> comment [lah] like #huda# I'm so proud of you
[kan] you're proud of me right
(ugh)
<malay>pergi</malay> overseas
<malay>tapi dia</malay> like <malay>pandai</malay> enough to go for local uni [ah] so I'm not too worried about her
(uh) I think her overseas dream is <malay>untuk</malay> like
after education [ah] like she wants like migrate
like <malay>kerja sana</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
!fuh! [oh]
get like (uh)
(mm)
help them
(mm)
singaporean
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
okay
ya it's a lot
(mm)
ya <malay>sebab dorang ada</malay> minimum wage <malay>semua</malay>
[a'ah]
okay okay (mmhmm)
it is quite low but that's the culture [lah] I guess so what happened to the guy
the seven thousands dollars a year
he just keep it
[oh] it's like a
okay
so that gave you hope to like be able to like
!huh!
(mm)
I mean <malay>kau ada</malay>
but the paying off is quite long [pe]
ya
and
so don't borrow that much money [lah] you want take a loan
you try to like pay
(mm)
(mm)
it's better to like have a loan with your parents than a loan with like a bank because banks are always like the interest <malay>semua</malay> the
ya I think the realisation that <malay>kita macam</malay> like growing up just like hits
are you gonna miss poly
[orh]
what would you like restart your poly experience if you could
what would you do different
what does that mean O two
[oh] <malay>sebab ada</malay> #dina#

industry
<malay>kalau</malay> all fails I I can be like a teacher <malay>kau pun nak jadi</malay> teacher
<malay>cikgu</malay> [kan]
<malay>cikgu</malay> #aliah#
(ugh)
(mm)
I mean like <malay>aku aku</malay> knew that I had like interest in like
<malay>kerja</malay> for like the community <malay>gitu</malay> like I like to give back to the society <malay>gitu</malay> because like
I don't know like
doing business just like sucks the life out of you like it's so like <malay>macam</malay> boring and like
I really like at the end of the day <malay>aku macam</malay> like
don't want to be an entrepreneur that's not the life for me [ah]

ya ya and then I knew it wasn't because like I was anxious before cause I had nothing to be like anxious about
and then suddenly <malay>aku macam</malay> like so like scared

that day <malay>aku minum</malay> coffee day [lah] because I thought it was just like a one off thing you know
<malay>macam</malay> you know experiment we have to do it like a couple of times to make sure you're right
ya ya ya then it happened again like I was so anxious then I was like overthinking
about things and it was so scary then I think
<malay>sekarang aku</malay> really cannot <malay>minum</malay> coffee again

(mm)
why
ya
(mmhmm)
<malay>kesian dia</malay>

is it <malay>sebab dia desperate</malay> to like
can like also get out of the house or something <malay>sebab dia punya</malay> environment very like toxic <malay>sikit</malay>

so speaking of football [kan] <malay>abeh orang-orang main bola ni semua dorang masih main ke dorang pun dah</malay> stop <malay>macam kita orang juga</malay>
[ah] <malay>negara luar macam</malay> #messi# #ronaldo# <malay>ni semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang masih main ke</malay> or they have to you know take a pause from this cause of the COVID pandemic
but how do they earn when there's no spectators cause I think that's a huge sum of money where they can get [kan] cause you pay then a lot of people watching the football so how they can earn their money besides the sponsors [ah]
!wow! so they really suffer [eh] so all industry are affected by this [eh]
<malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>tapi sementara</malay> [jer] bro cause [ah]
<malay>kalau kau tengok betul-betul</malay> [eh] <malay>sekarang kau tengok</malay> electric <malay>punya</malay> tariff <malay>dah naik</malay> nine point three per cent <malay>abeh</malay> so I think the government will first
give you all these grants give you all this money but in the end they will take it back I mean technically is like a business
for for them [lah] but I mean we have no choice we have to make do of what we can <malay>abeh sekarang ni kau kerja apa</malay> ninja van [eh]
[oh] savings [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> slowly your savings will also
<malay>jadi kurang</malay> [kan] <malay>abeh kau tak</malay> worry [ah]
<malay>tak</malay> bro that [one] was just (uh) interview that I went to went for
but then I decided that you know (uh) I don't think I can last in that line
I'm more interested in the healthcare industry since [ah]
you know my my poly days I I took that course right healthcare and management so I thought maybe I would just venture into into this line and then if this COVID thing going on
(um) not bad [lah] you know I think there's more opportunities in the healthcare industry so why not <malay>aku</malay> just try to continue so for now <malay>aku</malay> just (uh) <malay>aku kerja</malay> as a clinic assistant [ah]
which is quite tough [ah] <malay>banyak</malay> patients and
you know <malay>banyak</malay> demands
and I have to do a lot of things admin stuff but still (uh) no choice [ah] what to do [kan]
ya so these things are are the same [ah] so at the at the first few months these swabbers they will earn a lot of money and then now I heard that they
in fact they don't [ah] allow any swabbers anymore cause there's too much
even the doctors are doing it by themselves so
now they are encourage people to volunteer for for to become a swabbers
but as a clinic assistant [ah] I can tell you it's actually pretty safe [ah] cause you're fully protected you're under the the uniform
the protected gear [ah] [eh] and then (uh) quite safe [ah] <malay>kau kau kalau ikut</malay> all the safety protocols [ah] everything should be fine and should be
guess there's no I would I would say little risks involved [ah] I mean I'm a clinic assistant myself so I've been working there for six months or so and I've been healthy ever since <malay>aku tak pernah ambil</malay> <malay>semua</malay> [seh] so <malay>aku</malay> maybe [ah] my immune system is strong but I would say that if you follow the protocols everything should be fine
(mm)
(mm) <malay>kalau kau tengok betul-betul kat luar pun</malay> there's a lot of a
people who try to work as grab food deliveries [eh]
(uh) and it's been a growing trend [ah] I see a lot of (uh) races actually (uh) branching into this line cause <malay>selama ni aku tengok pun orang yang kerja</malay> grab food <malay>pun ye</malay> [lah] <malay>orang-orang kita</malay> [kan] <malay>betul tak</malay>
<malay>tapi sekarang dah macam banyak orang nak</malay> cause of the situation then they have no choice and they know that
times are hard so they will
they would they manage to sacrifice their dignity [eh]
I think [ah] then still I mean I wouldn't say dignity [ah] I mean that that job is you can earn quite a lot if you know how to play the game well [lah] I would say
(mm)
bro that [one] I think really depends on on the family that you're living with [ah] if you are living with your parents and then I mean that should be fine cause all of you are working if your parents are working as well or if they don't then you have to support them but if you are living with
know children and then your wife that's pretty tough though
<malay>kalau aku aku ada bini anak semua aku kena jaga aku kena kerja</malay> at least <malay>gaji aku</malay> [eh] <malay>aku</malay> at least <malay>rasa kena</malay> at least two point five and above [ah] <malay>itu pun</malay> depends <malay>kalau aku ada banyak anak ke tak kalau tak aku rasa kerja-kerja</malay> normal is quite risky [ah] <malay>kalau kau kerja macam</malay>
(err) <malay>gaji yang</malay> one K plus [jer] unless if you only living with your wife
then both of you are working then should be okay [ah]
(mm) that's the mindset of the youngsters nowadays [ah] you know our generations especially <malay>tapi</malay> if you were to think about it
know the traditions <malay>tu yang susah tu</malay> the culture of our our race [kan] <malay>kita nak ada banyak anak nak kena</malay>
you know
[ah] have a lot of kids for our parents you know
(mm)
(mm)
ya that's true though
(um) actually depends on the expenses that you are
having then
ya but I I worry [ah] if in the future I mean now especially with the COVID situation
I I think (err) the new families are more worried to even have children
you know cause they can't even sustain themselves <malay>abeh macam mana</malay> [seh] <malay>nak</malay> sustain <malay>kalau ada anak semua</malay> [kan] <malay>nak kena bayar</malay> bill
<malay>bayar susu</malay> diapers <malay>semua</malay> I mean of course definitely they they you know <malay>dapat</malay> baby bonus <malay>ni semua tapi berapa lama</malay> [seh] <malay>boleh tahan</malay>
<malay>tak boleh tahan</malay> [kan] <malay>aku rasa</malay>
ya but singapore <malay>pun</malay>
I mean <malay>kau kena faham-faham</malay> [ah] singapore <malay>dorang akan kasi kau</malay> grants for free <malay>nya apa</malay>
they will definitely get it back
(err) like <malay>sekarang kau tengok dorang dah</malay> increase traffic [eh] electricity <malay>nya</malay> price <malay>nanti air pun nanti mungkin naik</malay> so but I mean the government they are doing their best [lah] I think cause they really want singapore to success to succeed as a country [kan] to remain at the top
despite the circumstance that we are in
<malay>abeh</malay> no choice [ah]
government I think government will try their best [lah] but we we still have to find ways [ah] no matter what <malay>aku rasa</malay>
<malay>kita kena</malay> hustle [ah] this is a hustling years [lah] just like <malay>macam dulu</malay> [ah] time SARS <malay>zaman</malay> SARS <malay>dulu pun dorang</malay>
economy <malay>pun jatuh tapi kau tengok</malay> slowly
singapore will rise up again and it's really up to ourselves [ah] we cannot really depend on the government we have to hustle and hustle till we make it [ah] <malay>orang cakap</malay>
bro mine I think around six hundred plus [ah] cause I have a siblings in the house [kan]
so speaking of which you see the bills for our housing <malay>dah berapa</malay> [jer]
and if you living in a big house
a lot more family members you know
and then you use a lot of electricity or water
then if you have little you have low wages for I mean as as parents then it's really difficult [lah] for you to sustain
so and I think a lot of people are now hustling their way [ah] I mean legit especially I mean
grab food delivery riders out there you see a lot of people are trying their best working day and night
my I cannot really imagine [ah] but for now I I think I'm in the comfort zone so
sooner or later I think I really need to hustle [ah] if not if I don't have any savings for now still then in the future I'm not gonna rise [ah]
exactly
I think [ah] a lot of
things are affecting them
you know especially when it's you know you you've been quarantined inside the house
you you know some people say it's a blessing
cause you get to meet a lot of family members but (err) you forget to look on the other side of the coin where
if your family members are more aggressive
are more violent in a way so they are more trapped they are more stressed
and then they might hurt
the other family members [ah] so it's quite
quite a sad thing to hear
and then (err) you know
having to lose their jobs
you know all these stressful matters will definitely affect their mental health [ah] so that's why I think especially if you know if you have a lot of debt
so that's why I think most of them or some of them decided to kill themselves [lah] cause they cannot take it already [what]
and then so this why all these things [ah] need to to be considered but I think everyone is suffering in their own way so we really have to make do [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> personally <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay>
these things this [ah] period will go away
we just have to stay on and pursue and not give up [ah]
<malay>kalau tak</malay>
we
suffer bro
(mm)
(mm) true [ah] true
I think it's only important besides you know hustling for the money you also have to take care of our health [ah] legit
mental health physical health also
if you only focus on your work you can get sick
easily if you're stressed you know you have to take care of your body [ah] mentally physically <malay>aku tengok ramai sekarang kerja kerja kerja tapi tak</malay> exercise <malay>tak</malay> you know take their time to you know relax to ease off <malay>kalau tak</malay>
<malay>kau pun boleh terjejas</malay> [ah] <malay>kesihatan kau nanti kau pun teruk</malay> [ah]
so it's really hard it's we are living in a hard time so we really have to you know our priorities
and to make sure it's it is well-balanced [ah] ya and it's it's easy to say but
you have to make do [ah] with whatever we can we have to change our schedule change our lifestyle for the time being [ah] no choice bro this is the hard time [ah] then
I really hope that this thing will go away [ah] seriously
ya of course bro
(mm)
(mm) true true I agree [ah]
but [ah] I'm not sure if there's any difference cause right now
(um) with this situation going on
<malay>macam lagi ramai orang</malay> I mean <malay>dorang dorang memang susah</malay> [pe] so I think <malay>macam aku nak cakap dorang dah</malay> get used to it [lah] <malay>abeh tapi</malay> I think this is more troubling for people who are in the
(err) people who's been living
(uh) wealthily <malay>macam orang yang senang abeh tiba-tiba jadi susah macam gini</malay> [kan] then <malay>dorang macam terus jadi</malay> stress <malay>sebab tak biasa dengan keadaan macam gini</malay> [kan]
so I think is very difficult for those who are
[ah] who are well-off [ah] as compared to those who who who has been living (err)
<malay>dalam susah aku rasa sebab dorang dah biasa susah</malay> so <malay>dorang</malay> might know what to do or might hustle even like normally [ah] they do like hustle really hard <malay>tapi orang yang dah dah biasa senang dah biasa ada kerja</malay>
high position <malay>semua gaji besar tiba-tiba kena buang abeh tak boleh</malay> survive [kan] <malay>gini</malay> so that's why <malay>dorang</malay> stress [kan]
but this is their difficult times
and then we have to fight through [ah] and speaking of which [kan] <malay>berbual pasal</malay> COVID <malay>aku</malay> recently <malay>baca</malay> news trump <malay>kena</malay> COVID is it true
but what you think of trump personally like do you know that the the way how he conduct the country how he see people I I heard that he's islamophobic I mean cause we are muslims [kan] what what do you what's your take on that
ya islamophobia
[oh]
<malay>aku tengok</malay> [ah] [siol] <malay>tapi</malay> the thing is <malay>kenapa</malay> china <malay>buat macam gini</malay> [eh] I mean what's the rationale
behind their their actions <malay>macam</malay> I I don't think there's any benefit or anything to prove
cause what they are doing is is basically cruel I mean and I think the whole world is against it or most of the countries I would say even america or the united states [eh] the [ah] ya (uh) the whole
<malay>apa ni</malay> world
organisations [eh] <malay>yang</malay> the one with <malay>apa</malay> united nations is it
<malay>dorang pun</malay> are against it [tau] <malay>abeh aku tak faham kenapa</malay> they are still doing this [eh] but I think cause they are in the position of power so they don't give a they don't care [ah] <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>buat ni tak ada orang boleh</malay> stop <malay>aku</malay>
you know simply cause they are
they are number one in the business
and they are controlling everything
so even though <malay>aku</malay> might say that I'm not
I'm not I'm not
with trump but since trump is against china [kan] <malay>aku</malay> might side with trump [ah] just for the sake of you know of what he did of what china did to our muslims [kan]
then <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's it's it's really cruel [ah] but I don't know why <malay>kau rasa kenapa dorang buat macam gini</malay> [eh]
ya it it's so sad and so sick [ah] to be honest
yet the other countries are not I I don't think they are putting enough effort to stop their whatever they are doing [ah] I think it's it's too much [ah] to be honest
but like like like what I've said [ah] I think it's cause of the power that they are holding
you know in the business [ah] sector that's why (uh) most countries do not dare to to make any actions against them [ah]
which are <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's just too much [ah] to be honest this is just like <malay>macam zaman-zaman dulu</malay> [seh] if <malay>kalau kau belajar</malay> history <malay>kat</malay> secondary school <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau belajar kau tengok</malay> [ah] hitler <malay>kau tengok macam orang macam</malay> (um) stalin of what they have done
it's ironic [ah] we we study history and yet we we are doing nothing for the future to change what has happened to the past
we just repeating the same old thing you know wars
concentration camps and it's
it's it's just I don't know I don't see any change [ah] to be honest it's just
it's all about politics business
you know everyone wants to win a game and no one is really thinking about you know (err) what's ethically and morally right for everyone you know not just for the people who's in power
so it's <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's just it's just effed up [ah] <malay>aku rasa zaman sekarang dah rabak</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa nak dekat akhir zaman</malay> serious
(mm)
[oh] that that's
that's another actually interesting (uh) news [ah]
<malay>sebab setahu aku</malay> [eh]
the this black people they black people [kan] you know they have been living in america for so long
they have been going through a lot
you know especially with all those [ah] big (uh) big leaders last time (err) like #muhammad ali# the famous boxer and then
the black (err) civil rights activist <malay>ni semua</malay> they have been fighting for the black lives for so long and yet
they still do not see
the black people as
as american which is quite
I don't know [ah] I don't understand what
I don't understand the the the reason why they are so against the black people <malay>macam</malay>
you know it's it's it's
it's just a colour [kan] why the whites feel so superior about it
I mean I may I may I may sound biased [lah] but it's it's the fact that whenever whenever you open the twitter or facebook you see all these injustice going on and I'm not saying there's no injustice between the black community itself [ah] but
it's just unfair [ah] cause the whites are just taking over and then they are taking advantage as much as they can just cause they are white
I mean it's stupid [ah]
(mm)
<malay>aku rasa tak tahu</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
that's what I heard also [ah] <malay>macam apa ni dia ada</malay> counterfeit <malay>nya duit</malay> [kan]
but I think this is really just how the the mindset of the police or how the system of the police <malay>dekat</malay> america is being
perform [ah]
I mean you just see one george floyd but you never know in other streets in other places where how how did they treat other black people they make it they may be killed silently without us knowing
without us being seen on the video clip without being recorded
so it's really I think it's the the the police system in america is just so
screwed-up and corrupted [lah] in in all aspects and this is just one side of it and the world whole world goes crazy
[ah] so <malay>kalau aku rasa kalau kau</malay> as an american [kan] <malay>kau tinggal kat sana baru kau tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay>
how the black people really feels to be
to be looked down upon
to be castrated and to be really being to take advantage of [ah] in all aspects even in their lives their lives doesn't really matter [tau] so it's really sad [ah]
<malay>aku tak aku tak</malay> imagine <malay>kalau</malay> this situation were to happen in singapore
<malay>kita sikit</malay> [jer] <malay>dah</malay> riot <malay>dah satu satu dunia satu ni dah kecoh satu</malay> country
<malay>apa lagi kalau</malay> legit <malay>kalau kita nampak kita kita kalau</malay> witness <malay>kita nya</malay> own singapore police <malay>buat gini</malay> confirm <malay>kecoh habis perang habis kasi habis ni cakap</malay>
ya
[ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay>
I think it <malay>memang</malay> exist [ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay> the government is doing their best that's why they have all these laws have all these
(err)
rules applied in our countries so that we we know how to
take care of the other racial feelings but you you cannot escape from all these soft racism [ah] it it will happen in all countries in all places and <malay>aku rasa</malay> that's why the government
are are very strict with these rules so if you can see in facebook or twitter
if you can see any people that get recorded for being racist
the police will come down as fast as they can and then really resolve the matter [ah]
but it's really but the offence is really high I heard that's why you can't be racist
<malay>tapi nak buat macam mana kalau</malay> government <malay>tak tekun dengan dia punya</malay> laws <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>tak tak</malay> really [ah]
be serious about this then <malay>aku rasa kita nya</malay> country
will be like other countries [ah] I mean let's just look at our neighbour [ah] malaysia <malay>kau tahu</malay> malaysia <malay>sendiri kalau</malay>
okay <malay>aku sendiri melayu</malay> [kan] <malay>aku tak nak cakap</malay>
<malay>tapi aku rasa</malay> the malay rights over there it's
too overwhelming to a extent where it's
it's belittling the other races [ah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa dari</malay> malaysia
so <malay>kalau aku bangsa lain aku cina kata</malay> [kan] <malay>aku cina</malay> [eh] <malay>abeh aku nak beli rumah aku</malay> malaysia citizen <malay>tapi aku cina setakat bangsa aku cina tapi aku kena bayar</malay> extra <malay>mahal sebab aku cina</malay>
[eh] [a'ah] <malay>betul juga</malay> [eh]
speaking of which
it's also I think it's it's really the privileges [ah] [eh] in singapore but I think the privileges in malaysia and singapore is is different [ah]
ours is more like a soft privileges for the other race
and then for malaysia it's really the obvious privileges for the malays [ah]
but (um)
ya when you look at these malaysians [eh] they
despite all the privileges that they have especially the malays [kan] they they are quite complacent with
with the how
things are going on with the politics or how the government run the country
<malay>macam dorang tak bersyukur</malay> [eh] <malay>macam apa dorang dapat</malay>
that's what <malay>aku</malay> personally see [lah] or feel <malay>bila aku</malay> when <malay>aku tengok kat</malay> news
or
(err) videos on the internet what what <malay>kau rasa macam mana sana kau pernah gi sana tak</malay>
but I think before they I mean they I I think when they want to become the minister they had good intentions but (uh)
but then ya [lah] you know
when they are when they have the power it's again it's all about the power you know the the greed they have all these then they
their intentions changed
they changed [ah] in terms of controlling
and then they you know they do all these kind of bad things [ah] which doesn't really [ah] help the citizens so I think they they have lost their paths the correct paths
and it's sad to see [ah] <malay>tapi aku tak faham</malay> [ah] <malay>kenapa</malay> #najib# <malay>dia dia dah kena tangkap</malay> [kan] <malay>aku dengar dia dapat</malay> confirm he's <malay>dia dah</malay> found guilty [kan]
ya (mm)
[eh] I I actually agree [seh] cause [ah] when I when I watch [ah] the parliaments in malaysia [eh]
actually quite #jialat# [eh] like they the way they is not really ethical and it's just very chaotic inside the
the room that they are having
and then I'm pretty sure there's (err) a person in-charge [kan] to control how the situation is like when you know the arguments get escalated
or when they have their points viewed ya they want to really you know press the other people then they should really have a someone to control [ah] to make to make sure that the thing is in control but then
it's just so chaotic <malay>macam tak ada orang</malay> control [seh] <malay>macam</malay> those <malay>pekik-pekik suka hati abeh marah-marah</malay> parliament <malay>lain</malay>
ya speaking of which (err) I I got saw this one video
where all the malaysia parliaments
he
he can't even in proper english which I think that should be one of the basic (uh)
basic (err)
[ah] basic skills to perform when you are presenting to the other people from other countries [kan] cause you are representing you're representing your country [what]
then he cannot even speak
english
simple english perhaps
it's it's it's if if if you found it the the video on youtube I think you will laugh [ah] which to me I find it very very [ah] interesting cause how can someone
(err) who is representing his country coming from the parliament cannot even speak proper english
how do they decide on who should be the in-charge
of all this it's it's very interesting to see how other countries govern the people or or choose their people to represent what <malay>aku tak faham</malay> [ah] <malay>macam aku tengok aku nak ketawa</malay> [seh] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>boleh dorang ada orang macam gini</malay> to represent [eh]
(mm) <malay>aku pun nampak ni dekat</malay> facebook or youtube [ah]
but [ah] I think it's on twitter <malay>tapi</malay> how did he get away with this how can you ask someone to
to take the degree for you or you fake a degree and not get caught by it
I think (uh) it's a lot of mysteries happening in malaysia [eh] you can get away with all these things
(um)
but <malay>aku aku</malay> really wonder how
how the malaysians are handling their
their their their
[ah] recruitment and the position that is of power [ah] <malay>macam ni semua</malay> position important important [seh] <malay>abeh kau suka-suka hati kalau boleh</malay> just get away with all these things
<malay>tapi</malay>
if you were given a choice [eh] <malay>kau</malay> will live in malaysia or would you want to live in singapore
(mm)
[ah] that's true [eh] I I I been to malaysia a couple of times for leisure purposes [lah] [eh] but I really like despite how I I really admire my country
and how they govern the country with the rules and the laws but I just feel that
I don't know [eh] I feel like if I were to live in malaysia I'll be more happier in a sense [ah] but speaking of I mean in regards to your question [ah] [kan]
the money money wise I think what I would do <malay>aku</malay> would probably <malay>kerja kat</malay> singapore
<malay>tapi</malay> (um)
<malay>tapi aku</malay> would live there so <malay>aku</malay> can know have a lot of make a lot of more money [ah] <malay>abeh aku boleh</malay> spend
spend more things over there as compared to singapore you can't really spend that much you have to pay the bills and everything [kan] so
it's not that (err)
ya I I probably will work in singapore and then I would live in malaysia
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [eh] that's true [eh] <malay>aku rasa</malay> I mean
it takes a lot of risk I mean I would say there's a small sacrifice [ah] and then probably (err) you know
get a holiday or something to really enjoy if I really want to you know
to enjoy my holidays [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> if if I want to be in singapore also having to wake up later and then it still it still I think in singapore it still all about work if you are in the not in the higher position [ah] which you have to climb eventually
so [ah] I I think there's risk if you're living in singapore or malaysia
so I mean I will see how it goes [ah] I really don't know how to go about this
but definitely
having to live in singapore and been to malaysia before I really think I would suit
living in malaysia [ah] cause I think the lifestyle there is much more peaceful and much more fun
just feel that if I were to live in malaysia I can do a lot more things
especially when you have the money [ah]
(mm)
<malay>aku rasa</malay> it's all about
(um) how you upgrade yourself [lah] as a person
and if you really
have a good job
and have a good career
or you can do a lot of things [ah] doesn't mean you have to live in malaysia to live happily
or to live happily in singapore whatsoever <malay>tapi</malay>
ya I think these these these things is really about I think in singapore and malaysia also about education [ah] or anywhere else in other countries
as long as you have good education have a good job then you will live a happier life
(err) ya it's tough [ah] but I think overall still again it's all about balance [ah] if you study and work hard and doesn't really care about yourself you will eventually you know don't don't live happily [ah] which which is not the goal that you would want to pursue I guess
[ah] currently I don't have any girlfriend cause we are living in hard times and I I don't think I can (uh) I think it's more important for me to focus on myself [ah] [sia] I need I need to get more money first for myself imagine if I have a girlfriend <malay>abeh aku tak boleh</malay> sustain <malay>mata air aku</malay>
then <malay>teruk</malay> [ah] <malay>puas hati aku ada banyak duit</malay> then <malay>aku boleh ada</malay> girlfriend then <malay>aku boleh</malay> you know
<malay>kita dua-dua boleh</malay> enjoy
<malay>tapi</malay> ya [lah]
then what <malay>kau kau ada mata air</malay>
serious [ah]
I I think it's (uh) I don't know how how to say this but
maybe we we we have seen the wrong side of the internet
know we we may not <malay>kita tak tengok orang-orang lain macam mana juga</malay>
we just see what cause if you realise
these are the people who want attention so they will post this kind of things and then we cause we live on the social media a lot so we tend to think that this is the trend but maybe
people who are happily in the relationship together they <malay>dorang macam</malay> relax [jer] <malay>tak</malay> post <malay>apa-apa</malay> just happily stay together and all that so I think is I think we should not be influenced easily [ah]
to <malay>tengok orang macam gini semua</malay> [kan] I think <malay>ada segelintir</malay> [ah] <malay>mungkin dorang macam rasa</malay> the same thing <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>ada juga</malay> [ah] <malay>golongan yang</malay> you know (uh) having good relationships [ah] so <malay>aku rasa kau</malay> should give a try <malay>tapi ye</malay> [lah] likewise you know <malay>aku rasa sekarang tengah susah</malay> [kan] so now it's not it's not the right time to to find a girlfriend but rather to upgrade yourself [ah]
<malay>tu pasal</malay>
(mm) ya true I I think as a man we should lead
we should we should show that we are
we are the ones who are able to provide
and then not the ones who
to to seek help to I mean I'm I'm not saying in the sense that we we all should
should really [ah]
I mean I I I understand that some people some (um)
relationships they work equally I know they both hustle and they both help each other despite
whoever is lacking in in terms of financial or whatever <malay>tapi</malay>
I think as a man we should be the ones who
to represent [ah] the relationship and should provide and to make sure that we are the ones
are there emotionally financially for our partner [ah]
we can't rely too much on our partner cause I don't know I think this is a culture that has been set
for my race but <malay>entah aku rasa macam</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>kita tak boleh sebagai lelaki kita kena tetap</malay>
you know <malay>tunjuk yang kita boleh</malay> lead <malay>anak orang betul tak</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> no choice [ah] this is how
we (uh) most parents are dealing with their child cause <malay>kita pun nak kena</malay> survive [pe] <malay>nak cari duit</malay> it's all about money [ah] singapore is all about being financially stable [ah] and that sacrifice have to be made [ah] <malay>kalau kau nak</malay>
legit you want to see your son being fed and you want to pay the bills you have to work [ah] you have to sacrifice that small portion
for your child for that love in order for them to grow [ah]
I think you have to find ways on how you can make do
all the missing time that you have (uh) have with your child [ah]
so <malay>aku rasa</malay> that's why some cultures they
they
they have they they have maids to take their child
<malay>abeh</malay> (uh)
<malay>abeh macam</malay> (uh)
for some other other races they maybe they ask the grandparents to
to take care of the child so there's a bit of the bond family bond there [lah] I guess
but ya I think it that that part it's it's it's it's sad [lah] but we have no choice [lah] we are living in a country where
money is our priority [ah] over love [ah]
unless I think rare cases where you are living and you're having a good career
a good paying job
at the same time you can meet your
you can have the bond with your child with your son or daughters
but then again it's all about really the the time [ah] you have to make sacrifices [ah]
<malay>dah terpaksa</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's <malay>dah macam</malay>
<malay>dah ni dah kehidupan orang-orang kita</malay> [ah] <malay>sekarang zaman-zaman sekarang lagi-lagi sekarang tengah hidup susah</malay> so
we have to make do with what we can [ah] no choice
that's why <malay>aku rasa</malay> financial planning is very important <malay>kita kena</malay> plan <malay>sekarang</malay> before having a kid you know not just funfair <malay>buat lepas tu</malay> at last <malay>kita susah</malay> then all these problems come later for us to think so right now we have to think first before having a kid what should we are we
are we stable <malay>cukup tak makanan cukup tak duit untuk keluarga bayar ni bayar tu</malay>
so really [ah] it's really about upgrading ourselves make sure you you have proper planning
and make sure you can provide [ah]
(uh) both partners know what to do both partners know what are their responsibilities
and then we can grow
and to have a beautiful family [ah] <malay>tu aku rasa</malay> [ah] (um) yup
on your end <malay>kau rasa apa</malay>
it's all priorities [ah] [eh]
okay bro
alright
alright bro see you around bro
bye

hello hello [eh] hi

(mm)
women who who who
[oh] my god and then then <malay>sekarang sekolah macam mana masih kat (uh) <malay>masih kat rumah juga</malay>
[oh]
ya actually that [one] [sia] the
(uh) what work (uh) work from home and like all that actually it's been like quite
quite hard [lah] because it's like it's you it's very hard to contact your team
ya ya your teachers all like
you have to email them you know then they don't even recognise them
so it's a bit hard to contact them
like left with their phone number
<malay>susah sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> call call <malay>cikgu cikgu ini semua</malay> like
<malay>leceh</malay>
more like like usually you know when you go to the class then you like <malay>kenal</malay> all the <malay>muka muka</malay> of all the <malay>cikgu</malay>
then you can
<malay>macam berbual berbual sikit</malay>
make friend friend with you know
true
ya
then like you know when you on Microsoft teams or like Skype or like [what] or they use Zoom [ah]
Zoom
it's like a bit awkward [ah] because you don't know anyone like especially you go to new class
don't know anyone you know
so
very awkward
ya it's like it's like you <malay>berbual</malay> with like some
<malay>orang yang tak kenal</malay> [kan] then <malay>susah nak berbual</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> like
you don't know the name don't even know their
who they are you don't know their face also sometimes like especially like first day of school that time
I <malay>tak kenal</malay> anyone
like not even the profile picture [dah] <malay>ada dia orang belum letak lagi</malay> you know
so I don't even know anyone
fishing
ya because like when you don't understand like you have to email the teacher
then like you have to wait for the teacher to respond all
then like issue in class like you just can just say [eh] teacher how to do this [one]
you know
[oh] god but then now that at home right
during class all I keep watching Tik Tok [ah] then
ya got the that [one] the

then after that <malay>selepas itu</malay> like I cycle here cycle there [ah] everywhere <malay>mana mana selepas itu</malay> like just <malay>jalan jalan</malay> [ah] happy happy [jer] <malay>umpa kawan ke</malay>
ya
<malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
because like
(uh) that time during (uh) lockdown <malay>tak ada orang kat road</malay> [pe] <malay>jalan jalan</malay>
so like just cycle cycle [jer] [ah] <malay>orang orang</malay> then just
<malay>tak ada orang nak kacau</malay>

nowadays superpowers would be useful
ya ya then
[oh] my god Animal Crossing
it's been a while since I touch that game
then that time I go buy the Switch with you right
ya like I buy before during the circuit breaker period
ya I buy like how much [ah] six hundred plus dollar then I buy with that game the Diablo three

<malay>untuk</malay> for like
<malay>berapa</malay> like <malay>sembilan puluh</malay> dollar <malay>lebih</malay>

[dah] [dah] <malay>beli</malay> [kan] <malay>nak buat apa</malay>
damn you should play it
[oh] my god you just now just saw you say miss #bae# right like miss #bae# from our secondary school
then you reminded me of like secondary school [sia] I haven't been to like visit secondary school
why you don't want
[dah] <malay>lama</malay> [seh] <malay>tak berbual dengan cikgu cikgu melayu</malay> all
like it's been it's been awhile since we talk with them
ya [dah] <malay>lama</malay> [seh] <malay>tak berbual</malay> then like <malay>macam</malay> you see other than <malay>cikgu dia baik juga</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan kita orang</malay>
like most of them were quite nice to us
ya he wasn't he was just close to me
he he was the [one] I was I was the [one] I was of his first student
no I was his first student
first [one]
okay [ah] I might be the worst [ah] but like I'm I'm I'm the first
I'm the first at the best
ya no [lah] he was just a very nice teacher
and then actually like be without him right I think I already fail art
O O level
ya no because like actually before he came I was with mister #irman#
that teacher
then after that like (uh) I because he got too many students then after that everytime I ask him for help he will like put me aside you know because he you know like his his (uh) attitude [ah] he's like he would prefer to like (uh) (uh) give his attention to those who are better you know
he want to keep the A students A then after that like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> he
<malay>selepas itu diam diam</malay> I was like ignore [ah]
<malay>dia macam tak suka layan</malay> my my artworks then he <malay>tak nak</malay> really <malay>tolong</malay>
me out with my artwork
ya
then haiti
<malay>tak apa</malay> [ah]
<malay>selepas itu</malay> then like mister #shafrin# came
the person that came <malay>mabuk</malay>
he like he like one <malay>malaikat</malay> like that
for O level art I think I I wanted to do like some [oh] remember me <malay>beli</malay> the right then after that like I take pictures of the <malay>dia keras</malay>
ya
so basically me and him we like went around the school and then we took like pictures of like the and then like bascially
ya it's like supposed to like be old like hidden in the grass
like
you know you know like for example like (uh)
world war two bunkers
then like the world war two bunker got all the forest grow around them already right
ya
then after that like the
ya actually he make me watch one of the what Studio Ghibli animations
in a way it was about they tiny people they were like hiding inside the houses of other people
then they like run around
then they like got found by those people
no because it showed like <malay>macam</malay> the perspective of how a small person just as a big person would be
(um)
so my final artwork when it came out right it was actually like a
(uh) what [ah] it became like
I just did a photoshop [lah] of people like climbing onto the that was very old
[oh]
ya
and then I just made it like so it's like the was a forgotten toy you know the dead
and then below the bed
below the bed
ya then like below the bed then got like tiny people
then the tiny people were climbing onto the
you a tiny people
ya
so I just took some pictures of like people and then like I edited it into the
into the scene [lah] so that make it make it look like they were climbing onto the
ya [eh] I remember you were doing also [ah] but what was what was your artwork about
ya because you know like you haven't done art in like almost three years right because of polytechnic
[oh] my god ya actually that's the thing about polytechnic right now
polytechnic polytechnic is so like heavy on the modules right like even though the
it's very hard to use your focus on your and your studies at the same time
ya
then like I also like <malay>jumpa</malay> a lot of <malay>pak cik</malay>
the <malay>selalu kata</malay> to me [ah] like
(uh)
<malay>selepas sekolah selalu</malay> just <malay>pergi</malay>
trail
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> like
it's (uh) <malay>satu jam</malay> cycle from <malay>rumah</malay> all the way back to
the trail then <malay>selepas itu</malay> from the trail <malay>pergi rumah tak sampai satu jam pon</malay>
<malay>selepas sekolah</malay> but then like
seeing like how he busy school is right know because of polytechnic [kan]
I <malay>tak rasa</malay> like can <malay>boleh boleh buat benda mcam gini</malay> [ah] because <malay>nanti terlalu penat</malay> [ah] <malay>selepas selepas sekolah</malay> [dah] <malay>penat</malay> then <malay>selepas itu nak pergi</malay> cycle <malay>selepas</malay> <malay>selepas kayuh kayuh kayuh</malay> [dah] <malay>lagi penat</malay>
then <malay>selepas itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>hari hari selpas itu masih kena pergi sekolah juga</malay>
<malay>semakin penat</malay> [seh]
like that <malay>salah buat</malay>
ya
just <malay>penat</malay>
tired
even in english also I can say like tired [lah]
tired of like school like that school is so
especially if you in the engineering line
to me [ah] in my opinion
ya because like engineering like you have like so many exams
you know like for example like every semester I will always have at least four exams
like like my school rest no chill
then after that the for exams right like three of it is like theory
so you have to remember like different types of theory within one week
just to like pass everything at least you know
like still <malay>masih tak</malay> [tau] [ah] <malay>ada rasa macam nak masuk jadi orang</malay> army [kan]
<malay>tapi selepas itu</malay>
<malay>macam takut</malay> [ah] <malay>takut kena dapat kerja merepek</malay> [ah]
it's
I don't know [ah] people here people always say [ah] <malay>macam</malay> if sign on [oh] later you
you <malay>kena</malay> you will <malay>kena banyak banyak</malay> [ah]
<malay>nanti tak tak</malay> enjoy you know
ya
but
but sadly <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] like engineering
engineering is more less enjoying
that's why I would rather go to army [ah] even though it's quite bad for some people
then what about you what would you want to work as because #sui sui# in engineering
(mm) got chemical engineering
[oh] my god <malay>tapi</malay> ya earn and learn <malay>itu sekarang banyak orang tengah</malay> apply
my mum also <malay>kata</malay> like <malay>macam nak ambil juga</malay> [ah] it's like <malay>boleh</malay> upgrade skills but at the same time <malay>boleh belajar</malay> [eh] no <malay>boleh</malay> like <malay>kerja</malay> and then and earn <malay>duit</malay>
you know
[ah]
[a'ah] <malay>gaji dia tak seberapa tapi</malay> it's
<malay>lebih bagus daripada tak ada apa apa terus</malay>
[ah] then <malay>selepas itu</malay> nowadays also
<malay>banyak orang tengah hilang kerja</malay>
like you know people losing their jobs because like their company like realised they don't even need these kind of people
like they just basically tell they just tell you [oh] we got not enough money to hire you anymore
because of COVID you know
L <malay>banyak orang kena pecat</malay> so quite <malay>sedih</malay> though
ya then also like
you know that time I saw like Channel NewsAsia released this statistic
most people who like lost their jobs even though they get new jobs
the new job will only be like one quarter of their their orignal salary
ya it's like quite sad like I know singaporeans like <malay>gaji</malay>
<malay>banyak juga</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like
<malay>tak seberapa</malay> [pe] like
one person like my friend I heard before he earn like [what] five thousand in a month
but then like if you cut that to one quarter it's already like
how much like one one point five
then it's like one point five
ya
but the worst [one] is the people who who already have high pay [lah] because their
their lifestyle is already like (uh) I have high pay kind of hype lifestyle
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> like if Tiba Tiba the [oh] <malay>gaji potong</malay> then like their lifestyle is still the same you know
so their their banks will be like burning off like way faster than usual
but it's hard [lah]
like if you are used to like eating somewhere that is like more expensive then you like like the food there
or for example if you like your the sports is like very expensive like
you need to enter the place every time you enter it's like twenty dollar twenty dollar
like you you have to cut off like things that are very
good for yourself
like mentally
ya like that time the gym all close then a lot of my friends were like
gym people they were like very like
[eh] why gym close [ah] cannot work out anymore because their the reason they go to gym because their their house is very small
ya <malay>rumah dia orang terlalu kecik</malay> [ah] then also <malay>tak boleh</malay> work out <malay>kat rumah</malay> [kan]
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> even if <malay>kalau dia orang</malay> work out <malay>kat rumah nanti mak dia orang kacau</malay> or like <malay>adik beradik kacau</malay>
[oh] my god talking about working out at home
you got see Channel NewsAsia
they were like showing like <malay>macam</malay> a got these people they were doing like Zoom workouts
but it's a like void deck right outside their house
ya so basically like the coach they organise like Zoom workouts
but then the coach was originally like a
(uh)
coach at the gym
then like basically he cannot do his gym workouts anymore so he he did his like Zoom calls at the staircase
then he showed all the the like
static exercises at at the staircase [ah] then they people were like following him
I feel like it's good [ah] because like
ya because like
it really shows like that you can do anything but like anywhere
like it doesn't have to be somewhere
okay [ah] obviously there's some limitations [ah]
but
ya he went to the extent
no [ah] because his house was too small like he he he showed (uh) showed the
like programme like look at his house you know
he has like other people living there also like he cannot do his work out here because people will keep disturbing him
so like <malay>selepas itu</malay> he just <malay>buat kat tangga</malay> [ah] <malay>kat tangga lebih banyak ruang</malay> [pe]
ya
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> also got the malay dance group
because you cannot meet up at that time at that time we still cannot meet up for any activities
and then they they did the malay dance training on in the Zoom call
so basically they just individually <malay>semua</malay> like <malay>joget kat depan</malay> camera
savage love ya I don't know but then like
but then like they just <malay>joget</malay> at the camera individually but then like they did like their own solo part then there
it's quite cool [ah] because it shows right it really shows that you can acctually do things like not being at school
you know
true true
why you want to be farmer
like fun [ah]
you just open up the game that [one] [ah] <malay>yang ada</malay> Minecraft that [one] then you farm farm <malay>kat dalam</malay> game
<malay>sama juga</malay> [pe] like you
<malay>berkebun</malay>
[oh] my god wonder why
you wanna know why because you got the crush on the teacher last time
that teacher then he became he open up like the farm on top the roof
the mister darren #tan# that [one] or whatever his name was
ya
you should contact him man about the farming
no but he confirm like [eh] you last time from swiss cottage
then he like recognise you then he give you more chance what because like actually the his his concept of doing the farming is quite cool
he say like like singapore has so much like space on roofs like why not use those roofs to like make the farms
but to me also got one downside [ah] like what if what happens if
for example if the water on top start leaking
then later like they will start to do like roof damage to like the
big building you know then the person living below directly the farm like their roof will get
like damagedby water
ya
I know but like if if it comes to that point where
it gets approved where they do farming on top of like almost every building you know
ya
but but like I don't I don't eat vegetable [sia] but I like the concept
ya <malay>tak suka</malay> [ah] <malay>makan sayur rasa macam rumput gitu</malay> like
to me to to me like <malay>sayur semua rasa sama</malay>
it's like
<malay>but rasanya macam bila gigit daun</malay> then <malay>keluar air</malay>
<malay>rasa dia semua sama tak pernah tukar</malay> even <malay>kalau ada sambal</malay> [kan] <malay>sambalnya</malay> just <malay>tutup dia punya air</malay> like when I <malay>gigit</malay> into the <malay>sayur</malay> right <malay>masih rasa</malay> [eh] <malay>ini macam sayur macam daun keluar air</malay> then <malay>ada sambal itu</malay> [jer]
<malay>tak pernah rasa lain</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi sayur bagus untuk kesihatan</malay>
<malay>tak nak tak nak</malay>
<malay>tak suka sayur</malay>
<malay>tak suka sayur tapi suka</malay> earth so <malay>mesti</malay>
so must (uh) <malay>buat</malay> hydroponic <malay>gitu [lah]</malay>
yes
ya
and eating all the <malay>kambing</malay> the <malay>kambing semua makan rumput</malay> [kan]
<malay>rumput buat</malay> oxygen
<malay>saya makan kambing semua untuk</malay> save the earth
ya <malay>lebih rumput</malay> you know
(mm) but mutton taste so good
I know you hate mutton taste but mutton taste so good
that's why you like that's why you like vegetable
[oh] my god you know actually why I love hydroponics so much
I got tell you before last time when I primary school I was inside this environmental club
and then like when when we it was like the first excursion I had during [eh] during primary school
(um)
then basically they brought us to hydroponics farm
ya and then like (uh) they showed (uh) around [lah] like got the hydroponic all so they put they seed into like the sponge and then the sponge they put into the tube [kan]
ya then after that the tube is like constant running water of like
mineral water or something like that like inside the water got like the nutrients for the plants to grow
then <malay>macam</malay> very cool [lah] then <malay>selepas itu</malay> [kan]
I <malay>menang</malay> something
because <malay>dia orang buat macam ada kecil punya</malay> competition [ah] <malay>untuk macam bagi budak budak</malay> chance <malay>bawa balik benda</malay>
then after that I <malay>menang</malay>
I <malay>menang</malay> like a small <malay>pokok</malay> Ribena
ya
I think same thing like grape [ah] <malay>dia</malay> like mash mash mash
then after that <malay>dia orang macam</malay> just <malay>kumpul</malay> together then <malay>buat macam</malay> syrup
[a'ah]
ya
ya I think the moment they like boil and then after that they make <malay>macam</malay> like concentrate
then <malay>selepas itu dia orang campur dengan air</malay> syrup <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk buat yang kita</malay> buy <malay>itu</malay>
more thick
like more <malay>pekat</malay> [ah] I think I think confirm got like got like sugar inside like sugar syrup
to make it more thick
but ya then after that I I won the <malay>pokok</malay>
no <malay>dia orang</malay> just <malay>tanya</malay> like <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) they just ask about the facts on the <malay>pokok</malay> [ah] like the hydroponic or like how how like I forgot [what] [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
why it's inside the thing
like then you said like water inside the tube
something like that because we were only like primary school kids what we don't really like don't know anything [ah]
ya but then I don't know what happened to the Ribena plant [ah] I think my mum throw away already
I think we keep for like one week then my mum was like this is a very hard plant to keep then we just like throw away
ya I think so I don't really remember what happened to the plant
but ya then after that like (uh)
actually I saw this one whole circuit
[oh] like hydroponic
it's like very cool I think you would think it's cool also
it's like they use they use the fish the fish tank
inside got a lot of fish then the the fish like poop in the water all got mineral already right
then they will run the that that fish water into the hydroponic system so the minerals from the fish poop go into the plants
then they use the plants to feed the fish also
so it's like a continuous system
of like growing fish and and the plant so it's a fish farm and the plant farm
ya
ya
ya [lah] because obviously like the plants <malay>pon</malay> constantly be like (uh) consuming
all the fish poop you know
and the fish will obviously get bored of the plants already for for once
ya the were plants like a filter filtering the system
because you cannot over feed you cannot over feed like hydroponic systems also
plant will die
what about you what do you think you can do to change the world
you know like the greenhouse effect [ah]
ya question [ah]
[oh] my god
bicycle
excursion [ah]

unknown doesn't put like mature discipline implements

(mm)

it's good for the eye
okay thanks okay
you want to start you say [ah]
how's your day
it's been like I started I <malay>pergi pasar tadi pagi</malay> after that
okay so was what happened okay I'm going to rant to you about our friend
may
okay so <malay>tadi</malay> [kan]
so <malay>tadi tadi</malay>
basically what happened was she's not happy with the
six weeks thing right
so yesterday [kan] she I told you she texted me she was like she's going to do something about it I'm like ya you should do something about it
so
today
#cheng san# go and message me <malay>cakap</malay>
[oh] miss not happy I'm like okay so miss not happy then I told her already [what] what's happening
yesterday right
then #cheng san# was like [oh] I think she wants to like
convince everybody I'm like ya I know that's what is happening
and then may was so extra he started he made a whole group called scheduling
it's quite it's quite annoying [ah] <malay>pasal macam</malay>
so that group is called scheduling
and she was busy talking about how she interviewed these people these people as in like five people two directors and three
and #ming gee# that's six people okay
and she's like [oh] some of them say they are open to it
(um) and some of them said they want six weeks and some of them
say [oh] they confirm don't want that three weeks I'm like if you have only six people out of thirty people that's not an enough like
enough like amount of
sample group [lah] if you were to compare with the
thing you know
so ya I'm just like
annoyed
but
I told her it's whatever [ah] <malay>kau boleh buat</malay> whatever you want to do [ah] <malay>kau punya pasal</malay> [ah] so
ever since then like okay I'll tell them that there's this like zoom meeting there will be a zoom meeting next week by the way
so
look out for that
I mean her guilt tripping thing is like a form of
guess loyalty like
you don't want to do it [oh] so you are going to be the cause of my downfall that kind of thing you know
which is so
her [lah] and it's
ya she does that
she can get very selfish very fast when it comes to
her work especially since when she's worth banking
and I find that
a lot of the times she never even bother to like work hard from the start
she procrastinates a lot which sometimes I get it because
we got our own issues and everything
but sometimes like
dump it on everybody else [ah] like
<malay>kau punya pasal</malay> [lah] you know
you got your own issues then
(ugh) okay whatever
so I just like did it bye
good luck
ya but I mean this is what happens
this is what happens when you like live in a right you cannot
control
hi we are failed students and
this is us everyday when we do thing
sub for school
where your <malay>malam</malay>
my mother is here <malay>ketawa</malay>
she won't stop
I'm just going to submit this time [ah]
then now she go
[oh] <malay>suji</malay> [eh] I ask [ah] <malay>dah tanya</malay> [eh]
I'll tell my mum you don't sell the <malay>suji</malay> first until
like you get the actual
cost and what size she want to sell cause she just take the picture
but then it's like this big and I'm like are you sure you want to sell <malay>suji</malay> that small
for like
a lot and then she's like I don't know
it's so funny [ah]
ya <malay>betul</malay>
[oh] she wants like the square one which I think is about that size
but we don't know how much to charge yet she's looking at like the market price but I told her to look at
cost price instead
yes
[eh]
do not off
(mm)
honestly an issue in [ah] <malay>kau tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>dah pukul satu pagi</malay>
unfair I think we should be guaranteed to have like a very quiet time at this
hour but
I guess not
it's quite crowded here and
kim #boon lay# [kan]
man it's just generally quiet [lah] also
I don't know [ah] cause that time [lor] <malay>malam</malay>
the only night shoot I did
I can remember well was #syaza's# #syaza's# shoot
but #syaza's# shoot jingle was there
#serangoon# but the landed houses
I forgot that cats are like nocturnal
I swear
!ow!
but ya I'm quite nervous about thesis
I did like I moved my to dos
to this new app called notion !wow!
so it's like a thing on youtube now right
the notion thing and I've been using it for awhile
<malay>tapi</malay> I haven't really like used it fully because circuit breaker
then I moved it all on notion
and now I'm like a bit overwhelmed when I see my list
[ah] I don't know [lah] it's like I know that my mock is
progressing much faster than a lot of groups
but I cannot help but still feel very insecure about
my old place
ya
and I don't know how the double producers are going to like handle it
considering I'm already struggling with one (uh huh)
it is supposed to be simpler
I got nothing to say [ah]
<malay>bila kita</malay> jewel [ah]
we we go out like three times a year
apart from school to be fair we we meet like everyday [lah] in school so ya
[ah] ya
once every twice a month
<malay>apa kau cakap</malay>
<malay>keluar</malay>
okay [lah] <malay>itu enam kali</malay> [ah]
<malay>tu enam kali apa</malay>
<malay>dua bulan sekali</malay>
okay [lah]
ya
but it's it's alright
and it's I actually enjoy this song called favourite nightmare by blanks
it's blanks like
blank page ya
I don't know it's very groovy
<malay>lepas ni</malay> so <malay>sekarang tak boleh</malay> okay
[eh] but okay so
there was like a dilemma you know that I like songs right
and then right you know the new song dynamite
so the new song dynamite came out right
and I cannot figure I like it or hate it
because it's super catchy and I can remember like the words
not all also [lah] cause <malay>dia orang cakap macam terbelit-belit</malay> also still
so <malay>tak faham pun</malay> but
<malay>apa</malay>
I feel like
it's so full of autotune these days
in the song itself like it's a trend to like
<malay>kasih dengar</malay> the autotune
and I'm like
(mm) I don't know how to feel about it
but ya
it's still fun the videos kind of cool they shot in a studio and the build the whole like
they have this like scene and they built the whole set in a studio and it was super big
(err) my I think the only like studio that can fit that is neapolis <malay>atau</malay> infinite [eh] studios I don't know
but it was quite cool [lah]
super big and it's like an actual like
door that you can like slam
ya so the walls even though it's fake it's like
strong
good job K pop
like the hotel #del luna#
okay
time for us to learn
how were
ya man like you know you know about that boy I think like ten years ago he he's from right
(mm)
this malay boy and he graduated and he didn't know what to do so he learned he studied korean language
and he went to korea without like any money or anything so <malay>macam</malay>
no thoughts head empty just went there and hope for the best
and now he's like a translator for like so many K pop groups
because he can speak a lot of languages
and he <malay>tak</malay> even go for like classes to <malay>belajar</malay> you know he just like
self study the whole thing
so good job man
ya I think it's quite cool [lah]
I don't know
I cannot remember someone shared like that article to me
but it was like a long time ago but his lawyer always tie him ahead I'm like !huh!
maybe I should do that !duh! I will never do that
my social anxiety will be like [ho]
ya
but
it was an option [ah]
if we go korea but I don't think we will be able to handle <malay>dia orang punya</malay>
work ethic
considering
we are dying now
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
cause your your your heated my my I start first [eh] one for one [eh]
I don't know I always thought one for one was kind of dumb
because
if you <malay>ikut macam</malay> the business like module
you know that the cost is much lower
than you buy half the cost you know they have to do it like at least like what
third three hundred percent [kan] to get like a proper
profit margin or something
so I usually don't buy one for one unless it's like food
because
the
ya the food <malay>punya</malay>
satisfaction of the heart costs
a lot for me
compared to any material things ya
okay but ya I usually don't buy one for one and I can't remember anything that was
quite bad other than maybe like
I always buy things like notebooks for one for one
<malay>itu</malay> [jer]
okay you I know it's heated
depends I guess
just appalling ya
!huh!
are you sure are you sure
but only did that right when they first opened at century square
they had the it wasn't one one exactly but it was
<malay>macam</malay> you buy one and the second glasses you get fifty percent off
that was the deal that they had
but I don't know they have a good reputation [kan] a lot of these like youngsters like to buy owndays nowadays
try off the shelf as in what just
<malay>ambil</malay> and try
it's like feeding our insecurities computer act one day it's like [oh] you don't want to talk to people
here you go you know just come in
and like try on this bunch of specs you know
and then I don't know whether you try on or not so now like fifty people come and try on this specs in one day
that's kind of nasty
with our pandemic and everything
now I know they closed down the
<malay>tak bagi</malay> like anybody just <malay>masuk tahu</malay> so you have to like
queue to <malay>masuk</malay>
owndays
but still right if people are going to try out the specs it's a bit like
nasty [ah]
I have nothing to say about that [ah]
that one
it's actually up to like
personal responsibility and like social responsibility [kan]
it's like
you cannot compromise one or the other especially when we're talking about pandemics because
the virus is not going to choose you based on
whether
you are you are all by yourself or with other people you know they're going to choose you based on whether you are living or not [kan]
it's just like my issue with the the way they
relay the message of this like pandemic thing like how many people
<malay>sakit</malay> everything they keep saying they keep separating
migrant workers and community cases like as if
<malay>satu</malay> is one species another one is another species
like it's the same thing both is humans
if there's fifteen migrant worker <malay>yang kena</malay>
that fifteen migrant workers right the moment they go out right
they are exposed to <malay>tak akan</malay> migrant workers [jer] [kan]
obviously with everybody [what] with the
people that can be under community cases
just like
weird and another thing also was that
everyday <malay>macam</malay> add one two people like in the community cases [kan]
but my friends
and family members who are working on hospital are saying otherwise
so that's like another conspiracy that's like covering up
!aiya! it's so
shady
but we know that [lah]
but
but just what like
(mm) but that's what like breaks your breaks your trust
in the government and in the media right which is so sad
like I remember going to thinking like !wah! I'm going to be a journalist
you know I'm going to tell like
stories about the community and spread the truth
<malay>macam</malay> some kind of investigative like journalist <malay>gitu</malay>
but even the well known investigative journalists are doing it for the headlines let's be honest
just for the clout right so it's so sad [lah] like
we we have to rely on random people on the internet to like get real information
which at the same time people are making use of to like spread
false information
and then we all will <malay>mati</malay> together
nice that will be such a good like ending line but
we are only halfway through
we're not halfway through
nice
and we have to do more than what we see also because
(mm) just be honest
it's not just writing and radio it's the whole thing
another set of like nut cases
everywhere !aiya! it's just
I don't know <malay>macam</malay> as we grow older I guess
it's not that your like childhood dies it's more of like you start realising
what the world is then we get <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] okay this is how I'm supposed to be like tired and depressed everyday
but it's so sad that that's the standard
especially when people are like
<malay>aku lagi penat daripada kau</malay> you know I did more things than you yesterday and I'm like
is this a competition like are you trying to say invalidate my
tiredness
I just want to say I'm tired okay cause that's how I feel I don't want you to feel
insecure for the way I'm talking to you
but now it feels like a competition because you're like [oh] I'm more tired than you
so I'm supposed to like help you
feel better about yourself
I don't know why but ya
I don't know it's just dumb people are dumb
I agree I was people
but that's not true
ya <malay>pasal</malay> [lah] <malay>penat</malay>
I don't know [lah]
it's similar I think
it's human nature
that's true
I started
like looking into investing my money
honestly like watch stuff how people like really become millionaires
and they're able to like retire
at what twenty six
cause I don't know if I can do this anymore film <malay>penat</malay> [sia]
but it's very interesting like
they earn like a lot of money
but some of them I met I'm like I don't know how you all going to like be able to sustain that
you know what I mean because you're playing with stocks
which is like playing with
our economy going up down up down up down it's so fun like you know
(mm)
but that's how people grow their money right
investment
but there's still like that's still a grey area right
because I mean
the reason why gambling is like not allowed is because
there's this <malay>macam</malay>
addiction that you can
get stuck to it right
but do people like get addicted to stocks
to the point that they have no money
you know
just like my
ya
but you know what I mean
cause if you think of it that way and it depends on which <malay>mazhab</malay> you're looking at also
<malay>pasal</malay> if you're talking about
like <malay>kita punya mazhab memang</malay> we're not supposed to try gambling or anything
but we have no firstly we don't know whether stocks with gambling is like gambling
but no one is able to like
explain it
fully
so I'm going to keep my options open
there's other <malay>mazhab</malay> that's like
if you don't go off the deep end
it's fine
so
!yay! we love grey areas
!aiya! and then some more with this globalized version of the world right
everything's like merging right
like this idea of <malay>mazhab</malay> is it going to be valid in like fifty years if we're all still here
you know
that's like my question because the <malay>mazhab</malay> thing came about because of
like
different cultures and everything and it is to help the people be able to like
practise the religion without
<malay>macam</malay> concerns [lah]
you know and to fit the lifestyle
time how much lifestyles merge right
in like fifty years right
then is the <malay>mazhab</malay> thing going to change or what
because this is
islamic law [kan] but it's not like
a set in stone thing cause the <malay>mazhab</malay> thing was never like set in stone
until the scholars were like (hmm)
we got to do something about this you know
so more like the scholars in fifty years be like (hmm) we got to do something about this
you know and help the people cause people are going to move you know
like if a singaporean girl goes to like
I don't know the western countries
you know
she's going to bring her culture there
people there might adopt our <malay>mazhab punya</malay> practices
she will be adopting other <malay>mazhab</malay> practices and when she comes back here
then it's like (hmm) you know
culture changes also so it's like (ugh)
just
like I don't know I always thought about that I'm like
it's still going to change like
I think if you ask people people will be like it's not going to change [ah] but
I'm saying okay
like if you look at the history of how this was made then
it only makes sense that we should be moving with the times
cause at the end like the source of the religion is not about the law but like
just about <malay>sembah</malay> this one <malay>tuhan</malay>
and believing in our prophets our <malay>rukun iman</malay> and <malay>rukun islam</malay>
and not
whether
touching a dog is <malay>haram</malay> so ya that's like my
thoughts of this so deep
<malay>macam</malay> over
moved a circle
really [ah] shit
sorry
ya it's just a
it's a general discussion
it's about globalization
but I love tiktok
[eh] I spend a lot of my day talking (err) like watching tiktok
I don't know if you can tell
sometimes (err) sometimes I never notice then [oh] marina is like can you stop then I'm like why
and then she's like do you know how many sent I'm like no I just go
ya I forced her
I told her I wanted to send you stuff but
then you're not even on it so how am I supposed to send it to you I don't want to download everything I said that then she's like I'm not going to be on tiktok but then the next day she's on tiktok
looks like I got it
I made sofia go on tiktok also
she was shitting on her friends in school
to be fair <malay>kasihan</malay> [ah] <malay>dia dia macam</malay>
sec one <malay>lepas tu kena</malay> COVID <malay>terus tak ada</malay> friends you know she don't have proper friends in school
so she was shitting on her friends she was like
[oh] all these tiktok girls that's all they know tiktok then I'm like it's the same with you [what] all you know is anime
you know you cannot talk about anything else why don't you try and like
learn more about what they like so you can
you know be friends with them [lah] and then slowly
they will also learn to be friends with you you make their first move I said that
then she's like I will never do it
then my cousin did it
and now she's on tiktok also
it's just like okay
(mm)
that's a lie you send me stuff
okay sure
did you read about the the tinder algorithm
I didn't know they had like a
ya so apparently
in two thousand fifteen like someone exposed tinder's algorithm
so like when you first join tinder
like the algorithm gives you like a point system of how attractive you are
ya so if you are like like the more people like you the higher your
attractiveness level will be
but if the person who rejected you has like a lower
attractive level than you then you would automatically go down
because someone lower was like you you ugly you know and then if someone like more attractive than you likes you
then
your attractive level will also go up and that was the algorithm
few years ago
and last year they just changed it into like they said it was
a secret
but
everybody knows it's very similar
it's so shady like
!wah! I don't know man
are you saying me and #jufri# have the same face
attractiveness level
!eww!
do I look like that
so I already quit
so so in a few weeks because I've been super busy
and I got no time to even look anymore and I feel bad
because
all these people are like waiting for my reply and I'm like (err) so I just deleted
the scariest part is when
cause on on the app [kan] I I
at first I put my name
[kan] like my whole name I'm #nabilah#
after that
after that people could find me online you know
on like instagram and that was so scary I was like
this boy
just like me
and then I haven't even matched with him yet
and he already found me on instagram
luckily my instagram is private [lah] and then got nothing
also cause I don't post but
it was just scary I was like !whoa! people will like can find me anywhere
someone's going to find my like my baby photos then I'll be like
go do something with it you know
ya but the weirdest guy was still the guy that
who asked me for my instagram then followed all my friends
!ee! that's so disgusting
what a weird guy
(ugh)
(oo) I have that family member
you know that family member I don't know if I told you about him but he got married already [lah] to one of my mum's cousins
so basically he became with one of my he became friends with one of my mum's cousins
in secondary school so he started like
clinging onto the family
this is like there is a goal <malay>punya cerita</malay> after that
in that ten years span right
like he tried to get with that first girl that he was friends with
and then he went to all the cousins around the same age
and he was clinging to one of them at different points of time
then in the end there was this other girl
the girl who he got married to
and she had this other boyfriend and the boyfriend she was together for like five years <malay>tahu</malay>
so that's like
it's very long right I cannot five years and they and she was like dying to get married to him
but he wanted to study overseas which is understandable [lah] because when they got together they were super young
he went to study overseas then she got angry then they broke up
<malay>habis</malay>
the whole family was like [oh] <malay>dia dia minum arak dia pergi</malay>
<malay>apa dia makan</malay> drugs <malay>semua</malay> that kind of thing you know and then when we met him I was like he was crying
he was like
very sad about the whole how it went down
and then he got married to this bitch I'm like
[ah] you <malay>tak tak ada</malay> choice <malay>lain ke apa</malay> like
!ee! and the guy is not even that handsome he's just
he's ugly [lah] actually he's worse than #jufri#
ya
I think they lazy
it was so obvious
that's the worst part
you know I <malay>macam</malay>
like
are you okay
you know and then
(uh) but his
he's weird [lah]
I don't know I've never really liked him at one point he was the singer of the family then I'm like I didn't know he was family
cause I see him like twice a year like
it's just funny [lah] ya
it's weird there was this other guy
that I knew so he got married to this indonesian lady
they had three kids and then broke up cause the indonesian lady was a bit like a wild child [lah]
after that he he wasn't together with anybody for like a good ten years
then he started trying to get with one of the maids
one of our indonesian maids
that lady was <malay>cantik</malay> [lah] and she was with us for three years
but it was like damn disgusting
like <malay>kau tak ada perempuan lain ke apa</malay> that you want to go for this maid who doesn't want you back
you know and then then you know then that maid didn't want him the maid was like !eww! like that's disgusting
after that
he tried to get with this other maid and that is his own maid
and I'm like
I know it's kind of disgusting but luckily the other maid was like
!eww! no and then she got married to some other guy
indonesian much more handsome and fits her
cause she's very pretty
and this guy is like old the [ah] the
guy who wanted to go with her in the first place
I'm like <malay>kau dah tua</malay> stop it [lah]
ya the other maid is only like four years older than us
bro he's like double her age
crazy
indonesian girls
it's a thing you know it's crazy
[oh] my god
like
I thought it was only it goes on with like
white man movie that has that kind of kink for like asian girls
<malay>tak tahu</malay> asian <malay>pun boleh suka</malay> asian asian girls
it is funny [ah]
(mm)
I think he
he's crazy [ah]
[oh] my god that's that's like the the kind of guys that I will like shut down and not talk to after that you know
that kind of guys will be like [oh] <malay>nanti kita dah kahwin boleh masakkan</malay> I [lah]
<malay>masakkan</malay> I like some <malay>sambal goreng</malay> or something like that then I'm like !huh!
you think I <malay>kahwin ni mesti nak masak sambal goreng</malay>
<malay>kau kelakar ke apa</malay> you know
it's damn stupid
ya
I don't know
(mm)
it should swing that way
but I like male male chefs though male chefs are like
pretty cool so far all the male chefs I talk to are like
I will cook for you then I'm like that's right
it's like the first kind of the first group the one of the only groups of people
who will be like I will do something for you instead of you do something for me you know then I'm like [oh]
that's a good change
but I don't know
ya
[oh] my god when you don't have passion
gone
that's the worst kind
it's like I I I [ah] ya
it's like I get it [lah] okay like not everybody can have like a
passion passion you know
but I think you would have like some kind of outlook how your life would turn out in like
five years or something
or at least like ten years
like how you want it to look like
but no they just like [oh] I just
do like part time and
nothing much then I'm like [oh]
nice I don't know how to go on from there you know
it's funny
(mm)
<malay>banyak menganggur</malay>
like I'm sorry
I'm sorry that your insecurities are acting up because
I got to where I am
like I'm not saying you never worked hard but I worked for what I am and you know (ugh)
now now sometimes also I'm like
I don't know I find myself like
downgrading myself
just to fit a guy's standard
which is so sad
you know like especially if I really like the person
because of whatever
trivial
thing
which I obviously don't like them anymore
they'll be like
the I'll be like [oh] [ah] [lah] I degree <malay>tapi</malay> film [jer] film [jer] you know that kind of thing
like it's arts school it's nothing special
it's arts school okay it's so special
(mm) (uh) you're doing something so
cool and then you have to tell this guy it's not that cool
just to make him feel better about himself
about himself
!aiya! and you feel shitty about yourself I don't know I hate people
maybe I should just die alone
good for you good for everyone I don't know
uneasy
<malay>kau</malay> thanks man
that is just not my style
!aiya! my worst match just for ego boost [lah] lately only when I sad
then there's like the the
monthly cycle of like your emotions right so they always talk about specifically
but but they never tell me is that it goes on for a whole month
the cycle so sometimes it dips back down and the moment it dips back down right
it's the utmost match swiping
with that one photo of myself which I kind of like
ya like this is what you think of me
I don't look like that in real life (mm)
it's quite funny [ah]
there was a guy who asked what what was my weight
then I'm like I don't know if I should
tell you
because you're obviously not
here for me but more of how I look
and he's very curious because I didn't put like a full
like length photo
which you know
from my face sometimes you cannot tell now can tell [lah] then back then cannot tell
that's so funny then I was like if I tell you
what are you going to do
if I tell you I'm like hundred and twenty kilos what are you going to do
and then he was like
(err)
I don't know I think I will still talk to you [oh] you think
then he he left me after I said I was sixty
if you know I'm not sixty obviously
[ah] that's quite funny
I mean
(mm)
actually I'm the same [lah]
but I short lady [ah] so good for me
(mm)
I'd feel iffy about it [lah] but I I'll still talk you
you know I'm like I'm [eh] I'm short right
I'm let's be honest I'm short so I I always thought that
so the guy that I will be it will be a higher chance for me to get a taller guy
cause still all of the
okay the that one time I actually went out with that guy
he's too thin
that bitch like okay he said he was
taller
and I used the you know the calculator app
to see how much taller they did show me the actual science
cause I was like I don't believe him he looks damn small that's what I said
and he was small and
and I bet he was like !huh!
and I couldn't hide my my discomfort he was small
okay I'm not thin you know
I'm a big girl and so short he is small and thin
and I'm just like okay
you know I almost paid for ticket right for the movie ticket
because he didn't want to
pay at first
then I I just like he was like nevermind I will pay I guess
and then
he look at me he look I look at him then he like
okay I'll I'll pay like half I'm like okay I mean I thought you're going to pay for your own ticket [lah] bitch
cause I think you should be paying for the ticket
I didn't know that we had to discuss this we don't know each other so !aduh! it's quite funny
I didn't know it was a thing that girls paid for the ticket
I have nothing to say
maybe that was his experience
compensating for his lack of
height
ya
he was damn smart though the way he took his photos
it was all from the bottom up
I was like
this is like a technique I will use I guess in the future
!aiya!
I lazy [ah]
ya
higher angle [eh]
is it I don't know
I don't have people to take for me like nice photos and I I cannot like pose also
so I feel like the nicest photos of myself are like when I never even realise someone's taking a photo of me
because
I'm not
insecure
[oh]
that's my only photo that I use for until today because I don't have other photos
it's so sad (ugh)
ya
I have so many selfies
and then you can tell like the first like five selfies is like me like really want to <malay>perasan</malay>
after at the end it's like
like that
it's like it's like cheating myself like okay this how you usually look like
it's quite stupid [lah]
okay [lah] at least I rent a smart eight one [lah]
but he's damn tall [sial]
he's damn tall to me [lah]
you talk about him I'm like [oh]
[ah]
ya
<malay>kau [sial]
she you should ask him to like hold
sarah just texted me
then I'm like
ask him to ask him to hook up a camera and like take a picture of his view
it's okay [lah] he sees you like that [what] and he still like you so
that's all right right (hmm)
you you you know it's it's legit
I don't know I never checked she's like sorry it's a bad timing I know I think it's about me
I'm like !aiya!

for F forty five at #novena# shout out to F forty five #novena#
K (err) <malay>abeh lepas tu aku</malay> we attend (err) we attend the ten thirty class and then
we realise (err) like my friend <malay>pergi tanya</malay> the instructor [lah] then instructor said
the next lesson only got five people so we can join
so we joined the eleven thirty class also so
<malay>sekarang ni</malay>
<malay>semua aku punya badan tengah</malay> ya back to back it's really very tiring
<malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> it's more of like
(err)
[eh] you know because it depends on days some days is different but (err) you (err) okay wait ya they let me
put it in words ya <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>aku punya</malay> word
(err) cause it's recorded
I don't know whether if this will effect F forty five in anyway but
disclaimer it's just to okay I think maybe I should but it's just like you do work out then you rest then you do workout rest workout rest <malay>macam</malay> I think it's more it's like
#tabata# but not #tabata#
but there's a lot of variation in different different
[eh] <malay>macam</malay> like there's everyday there's a lot of different variation because everyday they focus on different things
ya
ya and then different station got different exercises so you'll never do the same exercise everyday
so like yesterday I went to station four I did like a certain workout and then I went to station seven at the second lesson and then I did another set of workout which is totally different and then
ya that's why I I like really enjoy because like somemore with the environment everybody <malay>macam</malay> just doing their own <malay>apa ni</malay> doing their own workout ya and then the instructor
(err) just walk around and then <malay>dia kata</malay>

!wow!
[ah] just saying it's recorded again
okay (um)
(um) [eh] but actually you know I was thinking [kan] actually
wait sorry I had to breathe but this kind of conversation right like you know okay if if you are in a production line [kan]
like you know you want to make a movie <malay>ke nak</malay> make a television show
[kan] you should actually like invite
like random people have a conversation random conversation and then pick up ideas from there
and then it's actually quite a good idea
I don't know whether they're doing it for I don't know whether they are doing it for your for your monday's one [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
it's quite cool mean meaning like <malay>macam kau</malay> imagine like currently you are just having normal conversation with a random stranger then <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> [kan] you just like
<malay>menyeleweng</malay> it's not is it <malay>menyeleweng</malay> no <malay>menyeleweng</malay> is like out of topic [ah] you out of topic and then some times out of topic they can use that ideas to
(err)
make a story out of it so technically they're actually if [lah] I don't know if they are using it but then if they're using your stories it's quite interesting [lah]
it's a good way to actually think out of blue because some times when we talk
or <malay>macam berbual merepek</malay>
we we come up with good ideas you know
or out of the world ideas
<malay>macam ni</malay> [lah] <malay>macam apa aku tengah berbual mana tahu</malay> this the idea of me thinking of this idea can be used as an idea for the show
ya
ya okay
<malay>merepek mungkin merepek satu jam dorang dengar</malay> [eh] <malay>apa ni tak ada</malay> idea <malay>langsung</malay> <malay>tu pasal tu pasal dia kata</malay> seventy to ninety [kan] <malay>dia kasi</malay> seventy [jer] <malay>kalau bagus gitu ni</malay> idea ninety
(hmm)
(mm)
seventy <malay>sana satu orang ke bukan</malay> [kan]
[ah] yes a bit <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>yang</malay> monday
<malay>satu orang</malay> seventy [oh] surveyor survey
[ah]
[ah]
okay
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>tak faham</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah]
(mm) ya [ah]
[ah] okay I
(err)
saying it to the people listening to this (err) we are currently students and if you have any (err)
part
survey offers or any voice recording or any [oh] if you are thinking of doing a podcast [eh] you can actually <malay>ambil kesempatan</malay> [eh]
[ah]
we come up with good topics but then the thing about us is we go out of topic as well
how from talking about how's our day to (err) <malay>sekarang</malay> we asking for job okay [lah] sorry I was cutting you short
I was cutting you so
[oh] twenty seven more minutes
[eh] that's good that's good
but like ten minutes passed by quite
fast
twenty seven twenty seven is not a prime number because it can be divided by three and
nine
what what is a prime number prime number can only be divided by one and the number itself
I think that's the main one of the few takeaways that I have
and currently all my knowledge from [eh]
just gone
ya [eh] actually ya I forgot everything you know you know <malay>yang</malay> the last time <malay>kita buat</malay>
statistics [eh]
[eh] <malay>aku bagus gila</malay> [sia] I think like I can !chey!
[ah] P <malay>abeh lepas tu ada</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> data
normal distribution and then upper distribution I think last time I was quite good at it
(mm) I was quite good at it <malay>tapi</malay>
[eh] pure maths <malay>aku pun</malay> okay <malay>tapi tak tahu kenapa dapat</malay> B [oh] I miss out one question
I told cause I
(err) maybe bell curve also [lah]
cause I told my teacher [eh] I I skipped one question I don't know how to do <malay>dia kata</malay> [oh] once you skip one question you confirm can not get A
<malay>agaknya gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>agaknya dorang mark</malay> [eh] !oi!
!alamak! all correct but one question wrong <malay>sekali dua</malay> question <malay>gitu</malay> [eh] <malay>dua</malay> question
two mark question is wrong and then they sorry [ah] B but <malay>babi</malay>
no [lah] but actually is is is helpful for those that
(err) don't do well [eh] wait actually no it doesn't
it's helpful for those that actually
like <malay>macam</malay> how do I say [ah]
actually it doesn't help [hor]
you just fail
[oh] ya actually he's true [ah]
like if you fail
if you fail then bell curve push you to a further fail
but then if you imagine you are a
<malay>macam</malay> normally you are just a fifty fifty fifty out of hundred student
and then just so just nice that you actually scores sixty out of hundred because you improved by ten ten mark
then bell curve will pull you short again
but I'm trying to see I'm trying to see what's the
what's the rationale or what's the positive thing about this [eh]
<malay>matlamat matlamat</malay>
<malay>maklumat</malay> information [ah]
no nobody can see your forehead
okay [ah] just saying that if you can see his forehead
his forehead is like
(um)
maybe five metres
overhead [eh] no overhead bridge is four point eight metres [oh] four point five [ah]
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
[oh] you want to take
class three ya (err)
okay [lah]
[ah] I'll okay because I
if I were to say okay
so I take it okay you try to read my lips [ah]
<malay>boleh faham</malay> I take it there
okay I took I took my license there okay I I because I can't say it because
our shit [oh] !oops! sorry for saying the S word <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>ke tak</malay> [eh] I took my driving <malay>kat</malay>
that place let's call it (um)
[eh] I took my (err) I would say I took as school students so not private [lah]
so I I went through their instructors and everything I would say
(err)
for that particular school right
they actually group you
to a certain instructor which I think is good okay but then a bad
you know nice some like that it's just that
I don't think it's random grouping because from what I heard (err) they actually put it according to a certain category okay so you read my lips again
okay so they put it according to that category and then
just so that my group is with all the <malay>pakcik pakcik</malay> [ah] I cannot take it like okay there's a few <malay>yang</malay> like <malay>macam muda muda</malay>
but I would say the no [lah] not my age [lah]
maybe
maybe early thirties late twenties but
the only person that can I can only click with one person as a my instructor
and during that time I was like trying to save money so I just pick
(err) <malay>apa ni</malay>
I just pick the cheapest lesson [lah] so I cannot choose my instructors so it's always gonna be random among the group of instructors just that I get the group the person I always get right is always the bad instructor sometimes when I drive and
<malay>dia kata</malay>
(mm) you think you are correct or not
you think
(err) you think you correct (err) you should should drive faster you should <malay>gini gitu gitu gitu tapi aku macam</malay> dude I'm just learning and then if you're not gonna teach me or tell me why I am wrong
then I don't know I don't see the point you know
<malay>nak</malay>
ya some more I I was so pissed [lah] but then
I think at that point I was just still
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] I don't I don't argue over !aiya! just <malay>sabar</malay> patience patience
yes
<malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] overall but overall I would say (err) cause I the last (err) I took my like (err) test like four times
so the first two times
(err) first two times I was bad in the circuit then I failed the third time I went out <malay>tapi</malay>
(err) it was last year twenty fourth december (err) because I remember so twenty fourth december I took
(err) my test and then
(err) it was I think all good the person wanted to pass me but then just because
(err)
but because I didn't give way to bus so he had to put me as immediate failure
ya immediately failure so
even though twenty you must you if you get twenty points you fail
can I got eighteen points but then because of that one immediate failure I fail the whole test so I <malay>merajuk sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>sampai</malay>
recently then october then I took my test
and then I heard #sharul# ya and then I heard #sharul# ya this year then I heard #sharul# pass then I was so scared I couldn't sleep that night
but I was happy
then #sharul# [ah] #sharul# took two weeks before me then I met up with him for dinner he said [oh] he pass already then <malay>gini gini gini</malay> then I'm like !wah! so good [ah]
then like I don't know I think it's a bit of pressure and then somemore I I really wanted to drive beccause I
like it's already my fourth time [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay> like [oh] <malay>penat nya</malay>
and then I was
(err) <malay>dia sekolah</malay> [eh] private private
ya then some more
(err) during my
so my test was (err) example it's on monday right then on the saturday I book with this (err) I book the practice session then I was so stress that I feel like I didn't attend the lesson
<malay>sebab aku macam takut gila</malay> but then monday I just went to the place and then I
I passed it I passed it was surprise so thankful
ya he he did he
he study before he failed then he

I was so touched you know like like yesterday <malay>dia tiba-tiba</malay> texted me say #izwal# (err) cause I ask her before <malay>dia ada</malay> slot <malay>tak kat tempat kerja dia kerja</malay> [lah] then she say don't have then

testing testing one two three [eh] [eh] okay okay [dah] [dah] [dah]
ya ya can can
to cope with the lesson
no I was just thinking okay because my main rationale [kan] was I I mean I could have sign a bond with like hospital <malay>tapi</malay> my main rationale behind not signing a bond because I don't wanna decide on myself too too early because I'm still year one
and then I rather use this time as an experience you know
like compare to my friends that actually sign a bond like you know
this maybe this one year that they they're actually getting allowance and everything
while they are actually getting allowance and not be able to work outside I'm currently working outside gaining that experience so it's like a headstart as compared to them
then somemore I'm like taking like
<malay>apa</malay>
I mean hospital hospital [lah] but then different hospital is different ways of like
<malay>apa ni</malay> work style environment right so I am trying to trying to like keep my options open for now first [lah]
<malay>tak nak</malay> like suddenly <malay>tiba-tiba</malay>
[oh]
<malay>macam</malay> sign to a place [ah] then <malay>menyesal</malay>
regret

sign on <malay>tak nak</malay> [ah]
sign on <malay>kena</malay> [eh] no [eh] [ah] I think sign on I will be a nursing officer

<malay>dia tak</malay> lightweight it's very <malay>berat</malay> it's like eleven

<malay>cantik</malay> [kan] [ah] actually <malay>dia ada</malay> another one it's called Nuna Mixx <malay>ini</malay> Nuna Mixx next <malay>yang</malay> Nuna Mixx <malay>tu dia</malay> fold <malay>sama macam ni tapi dia tak boleh</malay> shorten so <malay>dia macam dia</malay> compact (err) so <malay>yang ni yang baru ni dia</malay> compact and very
<malay>apa tu</malay> <malay>dia</malay> fold just nice [ah] and it can stand on its own and then <malay>dia boleh</malay> recline <malay>sampai</malay> [ah] lay very flat <malay>untuk</malay> baby <malay>baring</malay> ya and then <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> canopy <malay>boleh tarik sampai kat bawah</malay> the canopy the <malay>tu</malay> the cover <malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>bila dia tidur</malay> then like sunlight right either that or you [ah] you don't want people to see the baby right then you just cover the whole thing and then the wheels are very big
twin stroller talking about
demi grow
!huh! what
[orh] I no I I don't want to get a bassinet because bassinet only can use (uh) like zero to six month [jer] [seh] then if like
like no you use up to six months after that <malay>lepas tu dah tak boleh pakai lagi</malay>
because it's not meant for after six months [lah]
it's meant for something like that [lah] <malay>macam</malay> is heavy or probably the height or weight is not [ah] suitable <malay>untuk dorang</malay> anymore
according to the person [lah]
so I decided to take I decided not to take the bassinet kind but I'm getting a car seat so that <malay>macam kalau</malay> I want to take grab <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
it's like ya then I can just yes ya it's easier [lah]
because only grab can use (uh) if you want to take grab you need to have a car seat <malay>kalau</malay> you take taxi <malay>tak payah</malay> car seat
<malay>cik</malay> #usop# [kan] <malay>kawan abah cik</malay> #usop# [ah] what [oh] my god my toe <malay>sakit gila skit gila</malay>
my toe
it looks swollen
really
<malay>tapi</malay> why [seh] why is it even swollen [eh]
no cannot be !alah! I scared I scared it's (err) gout again [seh]
no [lah] I scared [lah] cause that time I also <malay>sakit kaki</malay> again you see already not the stroller you need to see how the <malay>dia nya tu</malay>
how it works ya you will see how how <malay>dia punya tu</malay> works I got so many things to clean
ya and then the <malay>belakang</malay> the <malay>belakang</malay> is meshed is like <malay>macam</malay> like on hot days right you can just take out the the top part <malay>lepas tu</malay> when she <malay>baring</malay> [kan] <malay>belakang dia dia boleh rasa</malay> [ah] <malay>panas</malay> [eh] <malay>apa</malay> the air and then this [one] also <malay>boleh buat</malay> like bassinet bassinet
because <malay>bawah dia punya</malay> feet area [kan] you can just snap out <malay>dia punya</malay> feet area <malay>tu</malay> then you snap back inside and then it becomes like a bassinet like that [lah]
ya
I love the colour also the colour is nice
ya ya ya ya you can you can ya ya that's one thing I like I like the handle handle bar
<malay>abeh lepas tu</malay> I also like the I like the colour of the handle bar <malay>sebab dia</malay> colour vintage colour ya and then another thing because I bought it is because <malay>dia boleh pusing</malay> and baby can face me instead
ya
ya and then like let's say [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>apa</malay> I don't want people to see her right even though she's facing me I can bring the canopy all the way down to cover her instead but she still can see outside because when I bring the canopy down <malay>dia tepi dia ada</malay> net <malay>ada</malay> meshed so she still can see some sunlight
ya it's good I can't wait can't wait for the <malay>barang</malay> to <malay>sampai</malay> next week I think about seven days

<malay>tapi</malay> laundry mat it's okay [lah] just get laundry mat [lah] better [what] can wash all <malay>satu kali ni</malay> wash <malay>dua tiga kali nak kena</malay> wash [seh] as in cause <malay>banyak</malay> [kan] so <malay>kalau baju</malay> baby okay [ah] <malay>baju</malay> baby
is very little and small so I will just dump everything <malay>masuk dalam tapi bila</malay> drying <malay>dia</malay> [kan] it's <malay>sikit sebab dia punya</malay> drying is <malay>dalam</malay> basket <malay>kecil tu</malay> you have to keep inside that basket <malay>kecil</malay> then <malay>kalau letak banyak-banyak</malay> it won't <malay>kering</malay>
I mean it's good cause <malay>kita dah tak larat nak cuci tangan pakai cuci tangan</malay> ya socks underwears all the small small [ah] <malay>ni</malay> [lah] T-shirt can T-shirt can but then you see [ah] if he even if he wash this [one] right maybe he can wash and then drying he go down
go to laundry mat to <malay>cuci</malay> to dry <malay>satu kali</malay> and is more saving [lah] <malay>dari dia pergi pergi bawah</malay> then washing machine and then after that you know [oh] no <malay>cuci</malay> is one thing right and then dryer another thing right so if he manage to to wash <malay>kat sini kat dalam</malay> washing machine <malay>ni</malay>
he just go down do it use the dryer

(um) so how is school these days
ya true
so my school starts actually for now it's like (um) <malay>tengah</malay> holiday semester one holiday then semester two starts like
october
october nineteen <malay>tu pun</malay> now is just only like semester one [jer] <malay>belum</malay> semester two then like it's still like year one so
<malay>macam</malay> I feel like year one <malay>ni lama gila</malay>
you know
(um)
then
ya my friends also like <malay>nak ajak</malay> hang out also my friend you know sarah
she <malay>ada</malay> club so she sarah and #nasrul# <malay>ni</malay> (uh) both of them is club is school of applied science <malay>punya</malay>
[ah] is more like your own course <malay>habis</malay> is more of like leadership <malay>punya</malay> kind of
then (um) <malay>tak salah</malay>
sarah also [oh]
sarah have like (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> event [ah] for their (um) for their so she's the one that like <malay>macam</malay> like overall in charge
so <malay>ada ada</malay> (um) <malay>ada ada</malay> groups <malay>yang kena buat</malay> event <malay>tu</malay> one is her group <malay>kena pilih</malay> another one is another group <malay>tapi nashrul punya</malay> group like (um) <malay>tak kena</malay> chosen and after like she's very busy with her club
until I don't know I think until next two week then after that next two week <malay>baru</malay> like we
me and #nashrul# all meet [ah]
cause sarah also busy with her
but
I also have my own <malay>tapi tak apa lagi</malay> <malay>pasal malas</malay>
ya <malay>pasal malas</malay>
then supposedly my is like tuesday and thursday
but (um) now we like on campus training instead of virtual so ya
then I think semester two
<malay>kita kena pergi sekolah balik</malay>
which is I'm not ready because
it's physically and mentally tired
ya
so (um)
when your exam start bro
honestly I respect those people <malay>yang macam dia orang sudah</malay> like for two years
and then doing the same thing that <malay>budak</malay> poly <malay>buat</malay> then having to go through the same thing like for another three years <malay>kat</malay> poly it's just so tiring and exhausting [ah] that's why sometimes I actually understand for those people <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>selepas</malay> they choose to just work
at the company and not choose to
at the company and not choose to
go and continue
<malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) studying in poly because it's very tiring honestly
for me like for example [eh]
poly [kan] <malay>macam</malay> also is like poly so like I feel like <malay>macam ni</malay> poly example I take it as [eh] having to do it for another three years it's just no I am not like
(um) I would consider [ah] because it's really
challenging then having to do assignments all over again
it's not like <malay>macam</malay> easy you know like for those people who really like (um)
<malay>buat</malay> the assignments the project the presentation having to do it the same thing all over again in poly is
exhausting [ah] like what I see that's why I really
salute those people who <malay>macam</malay> have the determination like and motivation to like just continue going to (um) poly ya
then for me also like my results it's (um) released on like I think one october and then my diploma courses also [eh] will be released on the email email
then ya but it's like (um) because actually there's two
phase for my diploma course first is the interview phase another
phase is just (um) submitting your diploma ranking course [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> your interview is fail then like for my friend sarah [kan] <malay>dia dapat</malay> interview so <malay>dia</malay> pass interview and then she already get her what [ah] her results that like she can go in like like her place for
(um) pharmaceutical science <malay>memang sudah</malay> chop chop for her so macam</malay> okay [lah] she <malay>sudah selamat</malay> she don't have to like focus on her grades you know because <malay>dia memang</malay> can already it's like
so <malay>macam kalau</malay> interview <malay>sudah</malay> pass then okay you can go doesn't have to look at your and all [lah]
but for me because my interview <malay>tak dapat</malay>
so like
now focus solely on which is (uh) <malay>kita orang</malay> <malay>pasal kita orang tak ada</malay> exam also so they look
over (um) they oversee our daily grades for each module and each day <malay>macam</malay> for us [kan] <malay>ada orang</malay> like
(um) <malay>sekolah dia orang satu hari</malay> is like is combination of subjects but for me is like <malay>kalau</malay> math is
maths [jer] for that day so like after that day they will like grade us [oh] how much will we get like A B C then ya
then after that like
if you have a lot of Cs means like probably your will be around like two to two point five which is
not what I want [lah] of course my expectation is higher
then after that <malay>kalau</malay> there's a mixture of A and B is <malay>banyak</malay> and like the A and B is a lot then after that your confirm like high is like (um) three to four
<malay>gitu</malay> then <malay>kalau macam</malay> C <malay>banyak gitu</malay> then maybe around two point five to three point five <malay>gitu</malay> then (um)
my A also my my A
I think is not a lot also
like <malay>baru berapa</malay> compared to my other two friend I think they did more better [lah] in a sense
then
so like
(um)
my diploma ranking course also I put first as biomedical science and pharmaceutical and biotech <malay>memang nak</malay> try <malay>dapat</malay> biomed if like if cannot also I would go for pharmaceutical science like it's okay for me but my my other friend my one of my classmates which is
jordan <malay>dia</malay> like
<malay>dia</malay> like <malay>mati-mati nak</malay> biomedical science [jer] like he go to common science program solely for that course but the thing is if he works hard for it
it's okay
but the thing he <malay>tak</malay> put in effort and expect to get that course which is doesn't make sense [lah] cause a lot of like biomedical science is a course where it has like a high competition you know a lot of people want to join in because of the jobs they offer and all
which is ya like
like almost all of my classmate if if I ask if I were to ask them [oh] what course do you want to pick like why is your first choice they would say like biomedical science that's for sure (um) and then after that but biomedical science also like biology wise [kan] and like a lot of
biology then because like sec five
I never take biology so like it's a bit hard for me [lah] then my daily grade from
biology also <malay>tak pernah dapat</malay> A
A <malay>susah nak dapat</malay> then it's mostly like B and C so if you want to go bio biomed also like you have to study really hard [lah] cause it's the (um) they focus (um) on biology the most
like it's important subject [lah]
so ya (um)
then
so like this semester <malay>tak ada</malay> exam so I next semester <malay>ada</malay> exam
for sure but (um) for my actually for me right
like this course is also okay like poly life for me is like manageable [lah]
still haven't to the point where I want to give up and all still okay <malay>pasal</malay> assignment <malay>dia pun</malay> is
<malay>tak banyak</malay> like is mostly more for lab practices and safety assignment then for the rest is like after you done for the day [kan] like through read virtually like other then after that (um)
teacher will give us like (uh) practice questions to do
<malay>habis ada</malay> quiz <malay>juga</malay> that you have to do like you have to submit before twelve
[eh] eleven five nine
then the practice question is like <malay>biasa macam</malay> homework <malay>gitu</malay>
but
right this question for biology is like
so hard even if you revise you before you want to do practice question there is like
so hard
like every time (um)
like our teacher will ask us to highlight the key points when answering the question but the thing is you don't even know what's the key point you know then how you want to (um) type it in the answer
that is hard actually then presentation for is
mostly <malay>banyak</malay> presentation but it's good [lah]
because like prepare you for the future cause confirm (um) when you enter working life there's a lot of presentation you have to do so I feel like other advantages and disadvantages disadvantages <malay>pasal</malay> like I think you will feel like
damn lazy to do the powerpoint and stuff and then you have to write scripts like what you have to say before (um) [eh] like when you presenting and all
then (um) for me [kan] like during secondary school also when presenting right I cannot impromptu I always must prepare script because like I can't impromptu
like impromptu is just like my weakness like if I have script then
<malay>kalau</malay> I memorise I think I can say it confidently but somehow if like impromptu [kan] is just like my weakness like
whatever I say [kan] confirm doesn't make sense
so like ya cause my english also is quite
bad honestly for me like because my vocal also
not that good so ya (um)
ya
and then
also ya
then <malay>pasal</malay> presentation the
presentation was okay as times goes by then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>senang</malay> [lah] but because they will give us like a problem statement and then that problem statement we have to solve it with a powerpoint slide like our answers and all like what we think what is our opinion on on this problem statement and then present it to the class but sometimes when you have like team mates <malay>yang</malay>
cannot cooperate with you
it is
gonna be hard you know
ya
(mm)
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
ours
is different [seh] we like on that day [kan] the presentation on that day you have to [ah] prepare your slides and everything then they give like about three hours for you to do powerpoint slides and then like script a bit after that after
our lunch break is equals to our study break like our presentation <malay>punya tu</malay>
I'm like is this even lunch break might as well just put it as study break [lah] [kan]
ya
(mm)
and it was (uh) two hour just either sleep they to write you off a camera thing of my mic slept then but still there was a assuming given at the end of lesson then I was like
sometimes I'm like !wow! <malay>kita dah</malay> eighteen
like you know when I was in like primary school I always like admire those people with like secondary school near (um) uniforms so <malay>macam</malay> [eh] how is it feels like to be like old like kind of old [lah] then I was like
now that I'm like at that stage [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay> actually it's normal <malay>macam biasa</malay> like !wow! it's just normal [lah] honestly
ya
(mm)
and it's okay cause <malay>macam tak ada</malay> boyfriend [kan] it's okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay> we don't really take that into my mind <malay>macam</malay> [oh] like die die you
must have a boyfriend must have like someone by your side like <malay>keluar</malay> dates with you know I think
I don't really mind [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> I have a boyfriend or not as long as <malay>macam</malay> that is like (um) <malay>kawan dekat</malay> you know I think
relationship with your friends and family is already good enough for me <malay>pasal</malay> later so you like have studies and all by the time you're like busy and all your studies like take over your schedule and all so like there's
(mm) no really like
time to spend with your
your other your partner you know
[eh] but for her [kan] NAFA
NAFA is like [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
really
[oh]
[eh] !wow! I didn't know that
[oh] my god that's so much friends
seriously
like different people also like different [lah] honestly like (um) the things that they're prioritising and it's all like <malay>semua ada masing-masing</malay> [lah] <malay>hanya</malay>
cause in the future also if you want to get married and you want to start a family you wouldn't want your family to <malay>macam</malay> have a lot of worries like [oh] <malay>pasal duit</malay> and all that of course you want your family to be <malay>macam</malay> stable [lah] like in every (um) ya in everything you know
ya
it's very hard [lah] like I feel like <malay>kalau</malay> family <malay>tak cannot like <malay>tak tak ada</malay> like stability and all that [kan] I feel like [ah] one day confirm will fall apart <malay>punya</malay>
for sure
and some more I also like the type of person <malay>yang tak</malay> message <malay>orang</malay>
like !wow! <malay>kalau dah malas dia punya malas</malay> is <malay>malas tak aku boleh</malay> like
for one week straight <malay>tak berbual-bual siapa-siapa</malay> cause like I'm that type of person [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> ya I'm okay with actually single also is not bad
like sometimes also like after I break up [kan] <malay>macam</malay> !wah! like heartbreak this heartbreak <malay>gila babi</malay> you know like that kind
but then like !wah! like <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm like okay with it like I over it I'm like
I'm proud of myself like !wow!
but even though like there are times <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam nak ada orang</malay> like to be by your side like a boyfriend [lah] okay <malay>kirakan</malay> like <malay>cakap</malay> good nights and good mornings all but then still I think
<malay>kita boleh</malay> get over it [lah] there's just like moments where we really like want to have that someone that kind you know
ya same
same [lah] as my
sister sometimes I also get irritated and annoyed like as you can see (um) every time I go out with my family like everyone is just like on their phones that kind and my dad is always
(um) gone
so like sometimes <malay>kalau</malay> [oh] <malay>ada</malay> family gathering [kan] it's nice like to talk about our own life like just joke around about something [ah] even my sister like
like (uh) video call her friends during [ah] <malay>apa ni</malay> I'm having a dinner so I I feel like <malay>macam</malay> like in like
you will need to have like some privacy you know it's not like okay [lah] <malay>kalau ada kawan tu</malay> okay but then like <malay>kalau</malay> it's time to like for your family you focus on your family [jer] <malay>tak mahu</malay> get mixed [lah] like video call with friends like
other time you can do [what] like <malay>kat sekolah pun jumpa kawan yang</malay> like <malay>jumpa kawan habis kat rumah</malay> also like <malay>kawan</malay> then like when are you going to like you know (um)
(mm) spend time with your family not really ya <malay>tak ada</malay>
that's cool I don't know
so was that awkward I never had that
ya after you see like other people's family [kan] is like
!wow! I'm lucky to be in such a family kind <malay>punya</malay> vibes cause different family different [ah] <malay>ada</malay> family like focus (um)
solely on like spending time with families other families just like heck care you know but I feel like in the future <malay>kalau nak ada family</malay> I think I would like spent mostly like my time on families then <malay>kalau</malay> like my <malay>anak-anak macam ada</malay> boyfriend <malay>ke</malay> girlfriend <malay>ke aku macam nak bagi</malay> advice <malay>sikit</malay>

test and
okay hi I'm #amir# I and my partner #salamah#
okay so first conversation was how
I got here [lah] so I mean initially we plan to meet <malay>pukul dua belas gitu</malay> but then I was a bit lazy so I was lazing at home so I went then I stayed then
I then I will just okay [lah] I want to <malay>naik basikal</malay> then now I'm regretting it [lah]
a bit
hot <malay>pun</malay> it's not <malay>tak panas sangat macam hari yang dah</malay> like the past few days it's not really that got [lah] but then I mean its a good time also now like three o'clock I cycle then forty five minutes to your place <malay>tak tak jauh sangat</malay> it's eleven kilometers
and the weather <malay>cuaca pun</malay> okay <malay>juga</malay> [lah] so I mean it's okay you got [lah] so I mean it's
but I think it's the perfect time [ah]
I mean when it comes to like face mask from what
I remembered I I need to refresh the the the mandatory law <malay>tapi dia cakap</malay> difficult if you doing exercise like any exercises running jogging cycling <malay>tak payah pakai</malay> mask [pe]
so I think when it comes to mask I wasn't very I mean I didn't wear a like a proper face mask <malay>yang kena</malay> and the one the government <malay>kasih atau</malay> the one that they government <malay>suruh</malay> [lah]
I just use the <malay>kain</malay> like the one the the they call it the <malay>kain untuk muka</malay>
then
ya ya ya the step cool kind I mean is also to prevent like you like at higher speeds like around you are cycling down
with like good high speed then confirm things are gonna go to your face so it's like prevent [ah] barang-barang kena muka</malay> like some debris you just go to (uh) face what's that at least <malay>apa dia ada</malay> protection because if not like
like you will either injure or just things going your
face your nose or your mouth [lah]
okay ya so I was cycling because I was doing part time
deliveroo so like most of the time it's like cycling and it's like but the pathway is <malay>tempat kosong</malay> so I will I can just keep cycling at maybe higher speeds like
like I can compared to a car I mean not until forty kilometre [lah] maybe twenty ten kilometer per hour to <malay>cepat juga</malay> [lah] but then
then some more <malay>ada</malay> construction <malay>tempat</malay> construction so
so the <malay>tempat</malay> construction is just debris [ah] then the <malay>habuk-habuk masuk hidung</malay> then I was like my nose a bit itchy [lah] then I mean
ya but that is okay not compared to there was a time [ah] I was like
cycling down to woodlands just to meet my my my girlfriend my ex girlfriend [lah]
okay [ah] then ya so that that was the time <malay>yang</malay> cause that one <malay>tempat dekat dengan</malay> forest forest <malay>sana</malay> because it's the #ulu# #ulu# <malay>tempat</malay> #ulu# <malay>sana</malay> so
by chance I wasn't wearing that face that that mask then ya [lah] (err) <malay>lalat masuk</malay> [lah] <malay>hidung</malay>
[eh] <malay>lalat masuk mulut</malay>
I mean literally it's not at house anymore [lah] <malay>dia dah dekat luar</malay> [lah]
[eh] ya <malay>dia masuk</malay> [lah] I mean
you you imagine you
you are cycling <malay>penat-penat jauh</malay> it's like you are <malay>jauh</malay> then
you are breathing in you need a lot of oxygen so you I don't think you are gonna <malay>pakai mulut</malay> [eh] <malay>pakai</malay> your <malay>hidung</malay> ya it's <malay>kena</malay> use your <malay>pakai mulut</malay> [lah] you
then by chance the thing <malay>masuk</malay> and <malay>nasib tak masuk</malay> my the the air pipes it <malay>masuk</malay> my esophagus straightaway so I just <malay>telan</malay>
I mean it's it's better that you chewing it [what] like you chew I I don't even know what I taste but
I mean it's just
after that I was okay [ah] so I think the house fly was
<malay>dia makan betul</malay> [ah] I also <malay>tak berak-berak</malay> so okay [ah]
ya I guess so I was fine
<malay>sakit</malay> no [ah] it just
I think it's just extra protein [ah] I don't know <malay>apa dia makan kat</malay> that #ulu# area and I mean forest I mean housefly they flies are basically came from maggots [what] then then they evolve
ya you don't know [meh]
so I don't know maybe there's something they rotten there then I'm just extra protein [lah] <malay>abeh</malay> some people confirm <malay>makan</malay> maggot [what] good
ya [lah] it's just that I got the most freshest one [lah]
you want <malay>nak makan</malay> bat
ya I
ya
yes I'm I'm taking my bike license [lah] my motorbike license like
I
currently I'm taking <malay>kat</malay> the the #ubi# <malay>sana</malay> [lah] I mean
I am like I mean cycling is a good thing [ah] like <malay>naik basikal</malay> if you exercise you go distance and if you work <malay>pakai kerja</malay> deliveroo or grabfood you earn money also then I mean but then I still schooling then I need transportation also [lah] like but I mean by motor also can work use for my grabfood and deliveroo also so I mean might as well I get a bike license [lah] bike license <malay>boleh tolong apa</malay> like like two in one so just settle everything
I don't
<malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> but I I think depends [lah] I think now the the rate <malay>dia dah</malay> really drop <malay>dah jatuh</malay> so
cause I think now there's a influx [dah] <malay>banyak</malay> I mean cause of corona a lot of people lost their jobs so they also now <malay>kerja</malay> [ah] apply for foodpanda grabfood deliveroo
I mean I I mean I have a <malay>ada</malay> grabfood <malay>dengan</malay> foodpanda [eh] <malay>apa</malay> deliveroo account [ah] I don't really need <malay>dapat masuk</malay> joined foodpanda [lah] so I think
I those two is enough [ah] and then now also <malay>masih</malay> because I'm now <malay>masih</malay> like recently <malay>kena</malay> diagnosed <malay>dengan</malay> hyperthyroidism so my <malay>saya</malay> I just <malay>sakit sangat</malay> [lah] I just <malay>susah nak nak</malay> exercise so ya so I mean now I cut down [ah] just do less
I don't remember calling it docket (uh) I think the maybe <malay>dia orang</malay> it's a foodpanda <malay>punya</malay> <malay>benda</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> for <malay>apa</malay> grabfood <malay>dengan</malay> deliveroo they call it [ah] incentive so <malay>dapat</malay> incentive like you deliver ten [ah]
deliver ten then you will get incentives like maybe for grabfood was ten dollar
you divide it a extra extra five dollar ten dollar then after you deliver hundred than maybe extra
thirty forty dollars that was <malay>itu pun</malay> only for
peak period like friday to sunday but then friday to sunday also you are not the one <malay>kerja</malay> [lah] the <malay>orang lain semua kerja kerja</malay> so you are challenging others people I mean not challenging you are like
competing competing <malay>orang-orang lain semua</malay> [ah] so
that is grabfood [lah] for for deliveroo incentive <malay>punya ada</malay> every deliveroo every delivery for for peak is extra maybe one dollar to two dollar so the good thing for grab for deliveroo is I mean
I mean I I work for both
I mean not this is not advertisement [lah] but then
they grab the deliveroo their support is like way better [lah]
like you in a in a pickle you just call [jer] <malay>nanti</malay> they just will assist you [ah] <malay>tolong</malay> just <malay>tolong</malay> you like just like that grabfood you call <malay>sampai besok pun dia orang tak angkat</malay>
[oh] ya ya depends [lah] <malay>kalau dia orang nak kasih</malay> tip <malay>dia orang nak kasih</malay> tip [ah] I mean in singapore I mean singapore culture itself <malay>tak ada</malay> tip culture [what] it's like sometime also there are people
you'll give tip <malay>nanti dia orang fikir</malay> [eh] <malay>ini aku dah buat dah dapat kerja duit ni apa pasal dia kasih duit lebih ni apa aku buat ni</malay> like they are thinking that's like something wrong but then is in the end they just wanna tip so i's a singapore it's not not a tipping
it's not a tipping thing [ah] like the culture
ya
second second
bro that one that one is I mean that one depends like I mean you cannot
that one is they give big tip is maybe
ten dollar
ya they give ten dollar I tip just <malay>kasih</malay> [ah]
ya they give I mean because the tip you can just give it through app <malay>atau</malay> the cash so they will just give you cash [ah] like from singapore's tipping
the app like you give you ten dollar that will get the ten dollar because some countries like for example in like happening in other places I think like the their
food their tipping like their the the person the company they <malay>ambil duit</malay> the the that it was supposed to tip but to you so it's like
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah] but singapore I mean they tip you you get the tip [ah] so that's what the company the company
like it's just
well I mean because <malay>tak ada duit selalu</malay> no pocket no cash in the pocket so they tip using a card using the payment make payment <malay>pakai dia punya</malay> that account [lah] so ya so my biggest is <malay>paling banyak</malay> is ten dollar [ah] [lah] but now is they give me cash see me
looking cool then give me ten dollar [lah] <malay>itu dapat terus sepuluh</malay> dollar just just the just deliver and it was a <malay>tempat pun</malay> like also like legit
cause it was a big so basically <malay>tempat dia</malay> is like <malay>depan depan rumah dia tempat makanan</malay> then he just like maybe
fifty meter and <malay>lima puluh</malay> meter [jer] I go down take food go up
and that really the delivery fee like what I got is already seven dollar then this add add of a ten dollar <malay>dia orang kasih</malay> then I got seventeen dollars I guess just for fifty meter <malay>pergi angkat itu</malay> [jer]
ya I got it for six [eh] four hundred plus [lah] like because
I mean long term [ah] and I think I really gain back that four hundred I've
been a long time ago [lah] like [dah] <malay>lama juga</malay> [ah] I've gained back the <malay>empat ratus tu</malay> so
like four <malay>empat</malay> about four hundred is still a good price for a good bike that is like
with the accessories [ah] <malay>barang</malay> like
it's (err) I mean you want to do something you on the road ride bicycle also or pavement you want something that you can rely on you you <malay>pakai benda yang murah-murah terus benda rosak yang mati pun kalau apa-apa jadi pun</malay> it's you what
ya ya
I mean
the thing is sometime <malay>pun orang</malay> like you rider you will sometimes take <malay>naik basikal</malay> you I mean then you anything happen like then [eh] #guai lan# <malay>padahal</malay> sometimes you forget [eh] your your means your safety first [lah] you don't even remember you like you just wanna get that money but then you <malay>lupa</malay> about yourself [lah] so it's quite stupid [ah] sometimes like you
sometimes you see
they those like
food delivery they like I mean
we are paid by <malay>duit apa</malay> by by by time so the time you <malay>cepat</malay> you get more money so <malay>kadang-kadang tak pakai otak nampak tu</malay> green green light <malay>belum</malay> green light <malay>tu</malay> showing but you want <malay>nak</malay> to go you want to go
ya [lah] so safety also have to come first [ah] because you are doing this thing like even like for me I take bicycle more high risk [lah] but then better I can go in to the like where the pedestrian <malay>jalan jalan</malay> [lah] so like <malay>senang</malay>
then then compared to bicycle ya but then you I since I can go two in one go to the road and <malay>pergi</malay> the pedestrian pathway <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>kadang-kadang pun</malay> singapore drivers
<malay>memang semacam</malay> [ah]
blind blind spot
(err) talking about check back blind spot <malay>tadi</malay> on the way here already I was I was really know I was
I I think I might feel fail someone from the the the I was like on the road going junction then there's a light then on my left is the zebra crossing [ah]
like busy but I'm not crossing on the zebra crossing I'm like walking on (um) from the main road going straight so <malay>dia dari</malay> the the the other side <malay>nak masuk</malay> the main road from the zebra crossing [ah] the junction so the
the driver <malay>dia tak nampak</malay> [ah] I like I was really prepared to break from <malay>jauh</malay> but I was already <malay>dah macam dah nak</malay>
I was really like to be beside her in that main road <malay>dia</malay> just jam break [ah] then ya I will I will initially I already jam break first
cause a he she right I don't see her like <malay>dia</malay> not stopping so ya she so I think I might fail her [ah]
[ah]
I mean not my problem also I like legit I was already on the road I'm wearing blue colour <malay>boleh nampak apa dari jauh</malay> then like there was a car like
there was no nothing no one else on the road on the road was me
I mean but
I was with I'm already maintaining my speed and never slowed down she just didn't <malay>tak ternampak tak nampak</malay> so I mean I was I already my two hands really prepared on to you break [ah]
so she just she jam break herself [ah] then just I hear <malay>dia cakap</malay> sorry sorry sorry but I don't think it's got that sorry you cannot help her [lah]
[oh] ya (err) so <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm taking my bike license [lah] like I mean as a someone who I think honestly as a
you license [ah] you
I mean it's a good thing for a license [lah] you easy save best like for demonstration but then I think when it comes to you are <malay>dari</malay> the cyclists [ah] you are like basically the food chain [ah] <malay>kat bawah sekali</malay>
so you know how the the most dangerous thing so now you technically you will go out [ah] as a motorcyclist style more car then you will like maybe can put yourself in other shoe [ah]
[ah] <malay>tahu mana bodoh bodoh yang macam basikal orang bodoh</malay>
ya like I think then I think the instructor <malay>pun cakap</malay> you because some people <malay>dah dia dah ada</malay> three A license of the three class three three license
then they <malay>dia orang nak ambil</malay> class two B then they then I think they instructor <malay>pun cakap</malay> [ah] you now okay now you guys are from start from car now you but <malay>sekarang nak nak naik</malay> motor then now you know <malay>orang</malay> motor <malay>apa yang jadi</malay> so just now I was doing practical [lah] I did revision but then I think what reason <malay>siang sangat</malay> because
like <malay>cepat sangat</malay> [ah] because I haven't booked my prac six yet overnight to go out on the road
so I think
(uh) prac five is the revision [dah] I mean it's the internal cost [lah] but I already cleared that just that I did revision because <malay>dah lama tak naik</malay> motor
six <malay>kat luar</malay>
but before that defensive riding [lah]
[oh] you mean <malay>keluar</malay> from the to the main road [ah] yes I that one I can see beside because whenever I go there I also <malay>naik basikal</malay> so I can see <malay>apa yang</malay> or like what's happening [ah] <malay>kata orang</malay> too happening [sia] I also <malay>macam takut</malay> [ah] <malay>nak nak nak nak keluar</malay> that main road just to <malay>naik basikal</malay>
so
ya
but I think I
I because I choose #ubi# <malay>pasal pun</malay> like <malay>dekat dengan basikal</malay> so I think I I mean <malay>naik basikal sana</malay> okay [lah] I don't want to <malay>naik basikal</malay> every time go pevery time go
ya
no
ya
I mean <malay>aku pun</malay> don't mind [lah] <malay>kena</malay> ride on some something ride on me but
depends [lah] so I mean every time I mean cycling far okay [lah] once in a while occasion so like how <malay>aku naik naik basikal sini</malay> to to here then also I need to go back <malay>naik basikal</malay> so depends [lah] but then <malay>nak</malay> every time <malay>nak</malay> take lessons no thanks [ah]
I will just take public but then now <malay>pasal nak dekat</malay> so I <malay>naik basikal</malay> to [jer] [lah]
<malay>dua puluh enam dua puluh enam</malay> the practical like depends [lah] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> in the evening that is twenty eight ya but then ya when it comes to outside the road then it's it's like ten dollar extra so
thirty six when it comes to revision outside or the the the test outside is sixty or so around fifty plus
six or five
ya
I mean <malay>basikal pun</malay> okay for exercise like I mean comes to <malay>dapat</malay> motor <malay>pun</malay> okay [lah] you
like for transportation because now also <malay>tengah</malay> like <malay>belajar pun</malay> like easy [lah] like <malay>boleh bangun lambat sikit nak pergi sekolah dari bangun cepat-cepat abeh terus naik</malay> public <malay>abeh</malay> public <malay>tempat penuh sangat</malay> then you cannot sit down <malay>terus macam</malay>
<malay>dah malas nak pergi sekolah</malay>
I don't know [lah] I think when it comes to transport singapore it's always <malay>macam</malay>
I I I don't know [lah] <malay>macam ada ada hantu dekat dalam orang-orang dah mati dulu-dulu punya perang cari balik</malay>
singapore I <malay>rasa</malay> [lah] I don't know every time it's like damn haunted start the singapore transport for the I mean the buses everything is (err) I mean reliable just that I don't know why [ah]
I was I <malay>rasa kubur-kubur dan kena</malay> you dug up the <malay>kubur</malay> then underground then <malay>hantu dah semua datang</malay>
I I think the bike I'm looking for is (err) the one like my friend is riding I think one five zero or one five
is it I don't remember I don't I don't no the bike <malay>kat sana</malay> is one sixty
I don't know [ah] I want to <malay>jimat duit pun</malay> okay [lah] but then I want to <malay>nak</malay> like I mean <malay>nak nampak</malay> handsome <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] so
<malay>tak</malay> handsome <malay>sangat</malay> [lah]
ya like [ah] <malay>muka aku pun buruk sangat</malay> so <malay>kalau</malay> <malay>pun tak tak boleh tolong tapi</malay> at least <malay>kalau</malay> at least I from a seven maybe <malay>masuk naik atas ke</malay> nine <malay>ke</malay> eight <malay>ke</malay> all over there [ah]
ya ya okay that one I
you <malay>pandai juga</malay> [eh] motor <malay>kau</malay>
I I don't even know what
those brands are like [ah] because I think the one that everybody using that have been recommending me fuel efficient is the I mean somewhat fuel efficient is one five zero [ah]
I think when I think <malay>kalau nak beli</malay> motor <malay>pun</malay> I'm gonna buy I think buy maybe (uh) as a second second owner [ah] not gonna buy until <malay>dah nak habis</malay> maybe maybe
seven more years or seven seven or seven more years [ah]
<malay>kalau ada duit</malay> of course obviously I will buy [ah] like a first hand but I think I still need to figure out [ah] like
like I I need to decide first whether because like if I were to do my work
like usually when it comes to like my future career I don't think motorbike is a good thing [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like that's because I would be <malay>macam jauh</malay> away from singapore ya like for <malay>enam bulan</malay> so I think see how first [lah]
ya
ya like I mean that's the that's the one thing [lah] <malay>ada ada datang balik terus</malay> the tyre <malay>hilang tinggal</malay> handlebar [jer] <malay>kat sana</malay> but park <malay>kat</malay> carpark <malay>tinggal</malay> handlebar I mean obviously there's one thing [lah] but
[ah] I so that's why I need to see first most probably <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] most probably I just comeback
I just keep renting [ah] depends on like what bike I want then
then (uh) I think most probably I will still <malay>nak ambil</malay> class three three license [lah] I mean
I mean we (err) like (uh) <malay>nak buat</malay> family cannot be bringing your child <malay>kalau ada</malay> child <malay>naik naik naik</malay> motor [pe] I means still can [lah] but then like cannot [lah] like but singapore I mean were asking if want to <malay>naik naik</malay> bus [pe] public but then
like when it comes to reliability <malay>macam barang-barang selalu</malay> breakdown you think you can trust can you trust singapore government
!aiya! I think that one too vague [lah] like everything can be improve [lah] <malay>semua benda boleh boleh</malay> improve [pe] <malay>ada benda merepek pun boleh</malay> improve
so <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] like I don't know I mean sometimes you cannot rely on wanting too much [ah] <malay>nanti benda</malay> problem <malay>nanti</malay> then you are relying that thing <malay>benda rosak</malay> then you are
like at the at the like a dead end
so <malay>pandai-pandai</malay> [ah] so that one also cannot rely too much [lah]
[oh] ya so I've been talking so I think maybe like your turn [ah] <malay>berbual</malay> for I mean this conversation we are having so
what was the question I have to remember [oh] was it something like okay what is the
which (um) the surprise <malay>yang paling besar yang orang</malay> like give like give you like you have a shock of your life
ya ya yes yes
freighter then I noticed the mere driver was my one of my teammates
[oh] so like [ah] okay okay so <malay>duduk lama-lama</malay> then suddenly you just don't know either <malay>dia orang datang</malay> so they put your car then what happen next
(um)
so we basically <malay>dah kereta</malay> you just waiting waiting then <malay>dia orang dah sampai tempat</malay> pick me pick spot then they just like
so they already park [lah] so then after that <malay>dia orang nak bawa</malay> to the place to eat [lah] so and so <malay>tempat makan dia</malay> at where exactly
okay now let's understand so <malay>siapa</malay> like you who <malay>siapa</malay> who was there like <malay>siapa kat sana semua</malay> like is it your all your soccer mates [ah] is it just them or <malay>ada orang lain</malay> celebrating
okay [lah] I mean ya I mean the also quite <malay>gerek</malay> [lah] but then like I mean
I think it's a good way to celebrate birthday [ah] <malay>orang</malay> like you are with [lah] people you love <malay>orang kalau kawan</malay> help your family depends like everyone like <malay>ada orang macam nak</malay> celebrate birthday they just want to celebrate themselves <malay>tak nak orang</malay> involved
like
everybody <malay>orang</malay> celebrate differently [ah] so I think it's good [lah] like you know what you want like you how you want to celebrate and that's and your friends you know that's how you want [ah] <malay>ada</malay> some people you want to celebrate they will they think that invite invite <malay>dia padahal dia tak nak</malay> celebrate they are just <malay>nak lepak kat rumah</malay>
<malay>nak tidur tu</malay> [jer] so I think I mean it's good that your friends you know what exactly like you want [ah]
so
my birthday present I think honestly now
just <malay>kasih duit</malay> [jer] I I happy don't really need to buy me stuff [ah] I think like [ah] you give me <malay>duit</malay> I I can spend myself you give me a voucher <malay>kat</malay> also I happy <malay>dapat beli beli makanan makanan biskut ke apa kat rumah</malay>
so I think that will be is enough <malay>untuk</malay> like for me [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
I mean it's good [lah] you like your friends chip in everything for <malay>barang-barang</malay> for you
so I think
right your your this celebration is quite I mean quite interesting [lah] like like it's like it's very it's a very like emotional roller coaster ride you like you are shocked don't know what the heck you are [eh] <malay>apa</malay> like what is happening and like
<malay>tengah buat apa ni</malay> what they doing [sia] you are <malay>dalam dalam hati</malay> is just <malay>takut tapi</malay> it's like excited like to find out
ya like I say [ah] <malay>duit</malay> vouchers are a good thing [ah] like I think like you know I mean they're doing it
for your friend or you like just <malay>orang</malay> just acquaintances you just <malay>tanya</malay> the mutual friend like [eh] <malay>apa dia suka</malay> [ah] like like like the person's hobby like for example like you know this person like likes to <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>pergi</malay> shopping rather you maybe buy a like get (err) voucher from zalora or something as long as I don't know I I also <malay>tak</malay> shopping <malay>banyak sangat</malay>
and ya I think the typical <malay>barang</malay> for guy is <malay>orang kasih apa</malay> [eh] <malay>kasih</malay> those perfume I guess the the they demo <malay>apa lagi</malay> (uh) they don't call it perfume <malay>dia orang panggil apa</malay> [eh] [oh] cologne [ah] cologne but I mean
I don't know [lah] <malay>jangan nak nak</malay> step <malay>atas cakap</malay> perfume <malay>sudah</malay> [lah] for me [lah] okay but
(err) <malay>tapi</malay> ya I mean for guys I think
ya the the best the most easiest I guess is a watch [lah] like <malay>senang</malay> [ah] unless <malay>orang dia macam</malay> those (uh) <malay>yang benda benda</malay> the all the watches <malay>dia dah dah dah ada</malay> rolex all the thingy thing then you then you just
alter course [lah] <malay>tak payah fikir pasal tu</malay>
[ah] ya
I mean I am okay grand if it's just the person that I want
even grand but then <malay>orang orang orang siapa</malay> [seh] <malay>ni aku tak berbual</malay> then <malay>terus</malay> it's like
it's like (err) it's like [eh] [ah] like awkward [lah] you cannot be yourself like you are they because they is grand [lah] so so <malay>orang kalau fikir</malay> okay invite <malay>orang lebih lebih padahal</malay> you want grand but then the people that you want that can be yourself <malay>tak payah tak payah</malay> no need to hide your personality <malay>gitu</malay>
ya
ya [lah] I mean but like honestly
okay that is I mean birthdays [lah] but then it's like I mean to me you <malay>fikir fikir</malay> birthday
what are you celebrating like the person's life like celebration like <malay>apa</malay> that has been going on on his life or like petty celebration of the I mean let's celebrate the longevity of the the person [lah] <malay>dah dah dah tua dah lama</malay> or you want to like celebrate whatever the person
like like what you say [lah] or whatever if the person has done but then ya [lah] but
like you have to know what the person like intention of what a birthday is [lah] for me
okay whatever you said that one <malay>orang terlalu fikir jauh sangat</malay> like you I mean like birthday birthday [ah]
<malay>tak payah nak</malay> (mm) <malay>susah sangat</malay> like what you said <malay>kalau orang nak</malay> book <malay>tempat pun</malay> as a as an example <malay>kalau</malay> the person birthday is on the december you want to book which hotel thirty first december <malay>orang orang</malay> confirm like it's gonna be fully book [lah] so it's gonna be problematic
so like I mean ya [lah] there are some people want to have the most grandest birthday <malay>nak barang-barang semua yang bagus</malay> [ah] like I mean for a celebration [lah] it's like it's a once in a lifetime
I mean birthdays [ah] once in a lifetime [ah] you can you are gonna be that age for once only (uh) unless (err) I don't know <malay>percaya</malay> reincarnation that one different topic [lah]
okay (uh) (uh) ya I guess that's <malay>susah</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> I think <malay>dah nak</malay> they by their by their age
they have to know [lah] like like it's not gonna be feasible [lah] for the rest of their life if they wanna do something like often but then with his once in lifetime you let people celebrate their twenty first birthday something grand then like okay [lah] whoever their close friends planning gonna plan like really
<malay>jauh</malay> [lah] like plan ahead very far like for example birthday twenty fifth december [ah] then you have to book very early but then
<malay>banyak banyak</malay> hotel <malay>pun nak</malay> book is quite hard must be nearer to the date then it's be very very hard [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> you're not the one like celebrating an occasion some people are like christmas where or whatever else they are celebrating [ah]
so I think when it comes to birthday it's like all ultimately is do you want to grand or not
okay [lah] ya I mean ya [lah] I mean going overseas also for a holiday or a birthday trip but then ya [lah] COVID <malay>sekarang buat</malay> everything <malay>susah</malay> even
not even just <malay>nak keluar</malay> holiday like <malay>nak keluar untuk kerja</malay> overseas is like the deployment <malay>kat</malay> overseas is <malay>orang semua susah susah</malay> is like now everybody <malay>kena</malay> in singapore like thinking
like they're like whether this <malay>apa apa</malay> this career <malay>dia orang tengah buat</malay> is on hold <malay>pasal</malay> of a pandemic so it's like it's a big talking point [lah] not just birthdays [ah] so like all other like holidays or even like work [ah] <malay>kerja kerja</malay> critical this is a it's like a
a good (err) thing that is I I I think like it's a good thing that is happened [lah] so like <malay>orang</malay> can just reflect is this a good like like it's like reflect [ah] like in the future is this [ah] like like you have to have a contingency plan ahead <malay>jauh jauh lain</malay> [ah]
I mean the furthest I went <malay>paling jauh</malay> is U like the I went to that was <malay>bila kecil-kecil</malay> [ah] los angeles that was during winter I was I was only like four years old so I don't really remember <malay>apa yang</malay> I did
but I think when it comes to like if I were to choose a place to go out maybe not just birthday [lah] a holiday or something [eh]
I think I will most probably do something
like maybe like if
like I would think or maybe going to east west of like of the like a road trip or just maybe just like go japan north to south that's that's what I would do [lah] a road trip
I mean it helps [lah] you you got you like you already plan [lah] <malay>nak pergi</malay> okay okay I want <malay>aku nak pergi jepun</malay> so I want to like at least <malay>belajar</malay> a bit a bit of keep like a keywords like
#taberu# <malay>makan</malay> like like all those [ah] keyword like #taberu# <malay>makan</malay> and [ah] #coco desuka# like <malay>ni nak pergi</malay> (err) like go where <malay>nak pergi mana</malay> go where some something like that [lah] so I think and when it comes to
food like what you say halal okay ya it's very hard [lah] <malay>nak cari makan makanan</malay> halal but then
I mean <malay>yang</malay> the big staple food there is you can just I mean <malay>minta</malay> so I guess <malay>ikan</malay> sushi <malay>nasi</malay> and one
I mean #hokkaido# no the highest I've been of in like the altitude is I think is only #yokohama# that [eh] no [oh] no #tokyo# is <malay>lagi tinggi dari</malay> #yokohama# so no that's the highest I've been is to #tokyo# so but
I think #hokkaido# <malay>tempat tempatnya</malay> ya is I mean from what we know as been advertise that their whole their what they're known for is
their I guess their ice cream and stuff [ah] <malay>benda-benda</malay> cream is usually <malay>benda-benda yang sejuk-sejuk</malay> I mean that that that latitude <malay>tinggi-tinggi pun memang</malay> understandable [lah] so ya I mean #hokkaido# is when it comes to <malay>makanan tempat benda sejuk</malay> [lah] dessert
I think it's not also just that [lah] I mean you also <malay>tempat</malay>
where there their place is like like even like you can say the japanese also <malay>dia orang pun cantik juga</malay> I mean their complexion is there <malay>tempat pasal</malay> there <malay>tempat sejuk</malay> if it's cold then you don't really sweat much <malay>tempat</malay> so it depends [ah]
I mean that's understandable [lah] you see <malay>orang-orang yang mat salleh orang</malay> those <malay>memang</malay> the further north
further like whiter they are I mean and when it comes to nearer to the equator you gonna be much more darker [lah] it's I think that one is like it has been for so long already and just that now people are more migrating more so it's a different more complexion
but the percentage point <malay>tak tinggi sangat</malay> [lah] so it's ya [lah] I mean that is all geography geographical location which is depends [ah]
honestly I think it's a waste of money <malay>orang</malay> like I think singaporeans is always
they have a or like they call it fomo fear of missing out it's like it's just <malay>takut</malay> [eh] <malay>orang</malay> also <malay>pergi</malay> then I never <malay>pergi</malay> it's like I cannot talk about it [sial] <malay>berbual abeh</malay> then they just they don't they just want to go just for just to make sure people know that <malay>dia orang dah pergi</malay> so that can talk
[oh]
okay ya so ya [lah] I mean wait this six hundred is a lot [lah] so
this is a this six hundred like what you say is a lot <malay>untuk nak anuh dah</malay> just for a very premium dining experience which is I think it's quite I don't know for me quite <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] <malay>orang nak belanja</malay> then up to them

which <malay>pada aku</malay> is just (uh) not a good thing it can lead you to I'm not a good thing I mean it can lead you to <malay>macam</malay>
a bad woman [ah] basically
<malay>bukan aku cakap</malay> not all <malay>aku tak cakap yang</malay> all beautiful ladies
<malay>perempuan lawa</malay> is basically <malay>jahat</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>kalau katakan</malay> [eh] like ninety per cent
ninety per cent
<malay>kalau</malay> from my point of view [lah] <malay>aku tengok dia ni lawa tapi</malay> [oh] <malay>dia buat kawan aku macam gini</malay> [oh]
it give you <malay>macam</malay> a thought [ah] <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>perempuan lawa macam gini</malay> [ah]
(mm)
like my like nowadays it's more of <malay>kita</malay> judge the book by its cover [kan]
I mean you can judge a person based on <malay>dia punya</malay> personality first <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> most of the time they judge on looks
just because <malay>dia tak lawa</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni macam gini</malay> [ah] <malay>dia ni macam gitu abeh kalau dia lawa dia ni macam gini dia ni macam gitu</malay>

<malay>macam mak ngan ayah punya</malay> time is more [ah] !wah! <malay>aku suka dia</malay> K [eh] she's the [one] for me <malay>macam gitu</malay> like
like last time people is more of a <malay>macam</malay> loyal [tau] <malay>sekarang</malay> is more of K [ah]
(mm) what you mean
ya attention <malay>kalau nak cakapkan</malay> they need attention [ah]
because now is <malay>kita</malay> living in a modern society [tau] so this modern society and singapore is quite strange to begin with <malay>faham</malay>
and we need to work and we need to think about this and that
<malay>tu pasal</malay> [ah]
<malay>rabak gila</malay>
that's why they need attention as like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) pleasure
not (uh) pleasure [ah] <malay>macam</malay> how to say [ah]
[ah] they need attention because they are young [ah] basically
<malay>kalau</malay> married couple for me <malay>kalau nak</malay> attention is very hard [ah]
for you to get attention if both are working most of (uh) most of the adults now you see is both working [what]
ya is have to
<malay>tapi kalau nak cakap</malay> [kan] [eh] (um)
<malay>aku kahwin dia tapi dia tak kasi aku</malay> attention <malay>tapi kita</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you're not [ah] giving both
both of like both of your life a chance [tau]
like
<malay>kau nak selalu cakap</malay> I need attention <malay>tapi</malay> you never see the point of view
as a married couple you need to understand a lot of things <malay>apa</malay>
that's why you're married because you trust each other
<malay>kau faham tak aku cakap</malay>
is it
no [ah] <malay>kalau nak cakapkan</malay> piece together all of it [kan] is <malay>susah juga pasal</malay>
<malay>sekarang</malay> is more like <malay>kita</malay> have different thoughts different feelings <malay>kita punya</malay> emotions all jumble up
basically
<malay>jadi kita</malay> [ah]
and singapore [eh] <malay>kalau kau nak tahu</malay> [eh] singapore is rated one of the most depressing country in the world [tau] serious
because of the stress that <malay>macam kita</malay> put on ourselves just to survive every month
that is quite harsh [lah] harsh reality [ah]
and singapore [eh] have the <malay>macam</malay> the highest divorce rate
one of the highest [ah] divorce rate in the world
mostly <malay>melayu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
it's very hard [lah] because nowadays more of like <malay>dia orang</malay> (um)
they never think
<malay>dia orang tak cuba fikir ke depan</malay> [tau]
they <malay>fikir</malay> okay <malay>macam orang putih cakap</malay> yolo [eh]
you only live once [kan] so they never think <malay>macam</malay> [ah] beyond horizon [tau]
<malay>dorang just fikir</malay> okay (uh) <malay>aku nak</malay> party [ah] all the way but <malay>dia nak kena fikir juga</malay>
end up you need to have a family you need to have a life a you need to have a career if not you're going <malay>macam</malay> downhill [ah]
[kan]
so <malay>pada aku</malay> wise [eh] <malay>nak cakap sekarang punya zaman</malay> is more stress [lah] basically
<malay>tapi yang penting</malay> [eh] <malay>daripada</malay> drama <malay>boleh pergi</malay> marriage

I mean like is like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) a playhouse [tau]

<malay>abeh kau boleh buat apa-apa kau nak</malay>
without [ah] without [ah]
without any mistakes [ah] [kan] like
<malay>kau boleh buat</malay> mistake <malay>tapi kau boleh buat mistake tapi</malay> it's (uh) it's scripted ya it can be soft because you're in the playhouse [kan]
(mm) (mm)
<malay>aku ada tu aku ada tu</malay> thought [tau] [eh] what if I were to become this guy this rich guy
what if I <malay>apa kata kalau aku jadi dia ni aku jadi dia tu</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> [oh] but it's not going to happen [ah] it's just that <malay>kau ada dia punya</malay> thought [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> end up <malay>macam kau</malay> face reality [ah] basically <malay>susah gila</malay>

<malay>abeh</malay>
I think total <malay>macam dua belas orang</malay> [ah] so they <malay>dorang</malay> like they need a cut off to go to the second one

<malay>tapi dia nya tu nak buat dia nya apa ni macam</malay>
I don't know what to call it [lah] like they hamburger but the bun part
the capsule [ah] ya that [one] <malay>susah</malay>
because you need like the right shape the right (uh) rise and then
like the <malay>apa ni dia nya</malay> height
<malay>abeh</malay> then you need to like coat it
make sure it doesn't break
[oh] [a'ah] <malay>korang</malay> exam
okay [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like the past (mm) <malay>dua minggu tiga minggu macam kat rumah kat dalam bilik macam</malay>
like you don't feel like you fulfil anything like that
<malay>kau ada buat</malay>
did you do
<malay>dekat mana</malay> [eh] <malay>dekat rumah</malay> chloe [eh]
!alah! <malay>dorang dua</malay> neighbour
<malay>padahal aku pergi sana entah buat apa</malay>
<malay>aku pergi sana</malay> end up <malay>aku masak</malay> mac and cheese
<malay>abeh dorang tiga tengah sibuk dengan dorang punya</malay> coffee
<malay>abeh aku sorang</malay>
<malay>susah</malay> [kan]
<malay>tak tahu cukup</malay> bro
mac and cheese [ah] circuit breaker mac and cheese I did in one week I did four attempts
I think my best was still the third one [lah] but
like I didn't cook a lot <malay>macam</malay> I cook a bit just for myself just to see <malay>apa ni</malay>
whether it's good or not [lah] like the combination <malay>tapi macam</malay> all four <malay>macam</malay> not that
fantastic [eh] [eh] actually ya
ya it's the amount
<malay>berapa banyak</malay> then the low heat
<malay>tapi yang</malay> actually <malay>susah</malay> singapore mac and cheese is the type of cheese
<malay>macam susah nak cari</malay>
my first one was I think white and
my first and second was white and orange the cheddar
the slice <malay>punya</malay> [ah] <malay>abeh</malay> the third one I went to
find the
cheese
<malay>aku tak ingat</malay> [ah] <malay>aku beli</malay> Cold Storage <malay>kat kedai tu</malay> [ah] <malay>yang</malay> Cold Storage <malay>yang</malay> Fairprice Finest <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>dia ada aku beli</malay> [jer] [ah]
confirm I cannot remember <malay>nya</malay>
really [ah] but actually like the whole time
<malay>korang masak</malay> like during is like not really
<malay>masakan melayu</malay> kind
so that time I tried my <malay>nenek</malay> then I just ask
what was it [ah] some <malay>sambal</malay>
can't remember I think was like <malay>ayam masak merah</malay>
then end up the only thing <malay>yang aku ingat</malay> [kan] is like there already <malay>aku masak</malay> #tom yum# <malay>nasi goreng</malay> #tom yum# [seh]
like <malay>korang korang masak</malay> is like
like <malay>ikut</malay> measurement <malay>berapa sudu</malay> all those kind of thing
then when my <malay>nenek masak</malay> then she <malay>ajar</malay> right then she just like [oh] <malay>ambil sikit ambil sikit ni ni ambil lagi banyak abeh ni lagi sikit</malay> then I <malay>macam</malay> stress [sia] I don't even remember what is <malay>sikit</malay> what is <malay>banyak</malay>
<malay>ikut rasa</malay>
that's why part <malay>ramadhan susah nak masak</malay>
so end up <malay>macam nak masak sayur pun</malay> depends on the age of the <malay>sayur</malay> that kind of hing
then you will like alter ya
Gegar Vaganza
Gegar Vaganza is the one show that all the <malay>orang tua tengok</malay>
I don't know [lah] my <malay>datuk nenek</malay> always watching [lah]
it's just singing show
but is not <malay>macam</malay> it's not <malay>macam</malay> Singapore Idol like they get new people then they is like talent is more of like already existing
artist which kind of like fell off the face of the earth
so like they get another shot of
ya like bring back the last time [lah] like #hady mirza# <malay>menang</malay> [pe] Gegar Vaganza that time
you didn't watch you should watch it
I never show you [meh] <malay>yang</malay> #hady mirza# <malay>nya</malay>
(uh) <malay>cinta luar biasa</malay>
okay later I show you then quite funny I saw <malay>dia nya</malay> starting that was his like second or third episode
then they were still talking about
like the artist what they did before this
then he was talking about his tempting #tempeh# his Grab his Grab driving
ya ya ya he sold #tempeh# for a while
he did a lot of things but it didn't like go very far
then like he was saying he went back to Gegar Vaganza <malay>pasal</malay> like
he didn't find like the things that he do like exciting to him or very fulfilling so end up he feel like maybe he was music [lah] so he went back to the thing
that's why end up before that also <malay>dia buat macam</malay>
emcee show host
like those event hosts like that

are you sure it's not like the
<malay>abang ipar punya abang ipar</malay>

then end up COVID then they just
went on with it [ah] <malay>kat rumah</malay> but okay [ah]
okay [lah] but I never actually ask how much they spend that time <malay>aku punya kawan pun kahwin</malay>
then like even lesser people came
then I think <malay>dia nya masak pun</malay> is <malay>dorang masak sendiri</malay>
<malay>dorang tak</malay> order cater <malay>tak</malay> I don't think is cater that wasn't cater <malay>pasal tak banyak orang datang</malay>
like they didn't invite a lot [lah] but then it's <malay>kat</malay> Zoom
then they like she invite <malay>kawan pun</malay> like secondary school just me and another person
then she invite like two of her poly friends <malay>dah tu</malay> [jer] then her bridesmaids [lah]
so it's like even as the bride herself <malay>dia tak</malay> invite <malay>banyak orang</malay>
okay [ah] but now <malay>banyak dorang</malay>
as in the company <malay>dorang buat</malay> is like cater <malay>hantar rumah</malay> [pe]

[oh] serious

ya junior zookeeper (uh) junior birdkeeper
<malay>kenapa</malay> [eh]
(err) do you think we should stop the recording now
okay but you have to keep
talking because
you
but if I talk and then you don't respond to me then what's the point of me talking
okay but so are you checking it now
should we just end it how do we end it do we just stop or what
now
okay okay okay

<malay>kenapa</malay>
but <malay>macam mana</malay> you <malay>terkeluar</malay> Zoom
I also actually I don't even know what is Miro
okay <malay>tak apa</malay> I I <malay>ajar</malay> you <malay>macam mana nak pakai</malay> Zoom <malay>dulu</malay> cause I use Zoom everyday so I'm quite
like good about on it
so
K so first start we need to like download Zoom on either your tablet your phone or your
laptop
okay <malay>lepas tu kena</malay> sign in usually cause I'm under like my my account is under the under school so I <malay>punya</malay> sign in is just under sign in with <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> personal I would think you have to (um) sign in <malay>pakai</malay>
your own email [lah] <malay>tak</malay> okay but let's just pretend <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> your own email okay
so I'll just sign in with mine so mine will be like redirect me to (um) another
platform another like website for me to open so sometimes you'll get that sometimes you don't I think
ya
and then
(mm)
okay so like <malay>selalunya</malay> when people ask you to join a meeting you will have they will <malay>macam</malay> send you a link [kan] then like from from the link you you just
click on the link then open
ya
so but then like
usually when you [ah] they will they will prompt you to sign up I think
but let me just create a new meeting and I'll just show you how it sort of works so you create a new meeting
select you can see like my background <malay>kat sini</malay> [kan] you it's <malay>apa</malay> (um) it's virtual screen so <malay>maknanya</malay> my background <malay>takleh nampak</malay> [lah]
[ah] so
<malay>kalau kalau</malay> messy <malay>kalau</malay>
yes ya
so you can change like your virtual background [ah] at the bottom at the start of the video and then you can just pick choose virtual background so during class I <malay>selalu pakai</malay> virtual background cause <malay>belakang</malay> messy [kan] so I don't want to like show my background so <malay>kalau</malay> it's not the option is none it would be no virtual background
then you can you can use their (err)
<malay>tak ni dah</malay> log in <malay>dah</malay>
as in it's after you log in
yes ya
ya so these are some of the like preset that they give you [lah] I'm not sure about your personal [one] but my school [one] has like
(um) my school's background
so (uh) you can also add in your own photo so for me I <malay>macam</malay> I create I even created my own background just to
<malay>bagi lawa</malay> [lah] so I I use this
<malay>tapi kadang-kadang kalau pakai ni</malay> [kan] it's
(err) you will not be able to see what like let's say I'm showing a piece of paper in front of me
cause of the green screen it won't be able to show [lah]
(mm)
K
so background is done and then (um) <malay>apa lagi nak tahu</malay>
(mm)
okay so like for usually your share screen will be under here I think that it's the same for tablet <malay>dengan</malay> iPad I think [ah] ya
so when you click share screen right
I'm not sure about (um) <malay>apa</malay> not android <malay>apa nama dia</malay> Windows <malay>punya</malay> laptop but
like usually will have a different different kind of windows
so
so <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>pakai</malay> desktop [kan]
it will show everything that I go
it will show like so even if I'm on Zoom and then I click open my WhatsApp <malay>punya</malay> web
everybody can see that
but
ya but if I <malay>pakai</malay> if I choose the Google chrome <malay>punya</malay> [kan]
it will just show whatever is on my Google chrome
so even <malay>kalau macam</malay> I <malay>tengah pakai</malay> Google chrome <malay>lepas tu</malay> I open WhatsApp web
<malay>dia tak akan nampak</malay> I <malay>punya</malay> WhatsApp web
ya cause cause I choose only my my Google chrome <malay>punya</malay> (err) window
okay so that's how you share screen then you just click share [lah] share
so like this would be hard <malay>macam</malay> (uh) once you share screen this will be your screen and then you can just toggle back to your Zoom I'm not sure about for for Mac I can just (um)
slide
okay then whenever you want to stop sharing screen
[ah] you stop share [lah]
ya so you just stop share
okay then another important is your mute button cause you know <malay>selalu macam</malay>
you <malay>selalu cakap</malay> then ya so muting sometimes even or when you whisper <malay>orang boleh dengar</malay>
so just make sure that the if if there's a cancel sign the red colour sign it means you're muted
ya
and then it goes the same for the video [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> your video <malay>takde</malay> they will just show your name like this
ya then you just unmute usually for me <malay>dalam</malay> class I'll just unmute I I'll just mute myself
(mm)
<malay>ni</malay> [lah]
<malay>tak yang tunjuk</malay> you <malay>tadi</malay>
ya it's it's exactly this so if let's say (um) they will ask you for the prompt at the start
no that [one] is cause she downloaded on her iPad right
she download on iPad and then after that whenever you download an app on your iPad <malay>dia akan tanya kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> (err) <malay>apa</malay>
allow
<malay>macam</malay> for privacy measures they will ask you to like allow allow camera allow microphone
ya yes so like for hers <malay>tadi</malay> (um)
she chose don't allow
so even <malay>kalau</malay> even <malay>kalau dia</malay>
pick the stop video I mean I mean [ah] like on her video it will not allow cause she her
ya her own iPad settings already say no
ya so
so <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>pakai</malay> video [kan]
(uh) <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
you just make sure that
it's not cancelled like the red sign is not there
actually you can see yourself [lah] <malay>kat tepi</malay>
right so as long as you see your name it means that you are <malay>apa</malay> the video is done I mean the video is off
<malay>apa</malay> done
(mm)
and then other basic things is like <malay>macam</malay>
okay I don't even know I don't really know if you use this during your meetings but like for my classes they will usually have like
raise up your hands or (err) <malay>apa</malay>
thumbs up thumbs down
okay I don't really have it [oh] <malay>dengan</malay> yes no
okay so they will just ask [oh] [ah] who knows this question who knows the answer to this question raise your hands then you just <malay>angkat tangan</malay>
<malay>tapi angkat tangan takde kat sini</malay> [lah]
okay so it's at the bottom of the screen and then just click
and then you just click participants
and then you just click usually it will be a like raise hands (uh) put down your hands yes no
(err) thumbs up thumbs down but I usually use yes no and thumbs [ah] hands up
ya usually at the participants area [lah]
ya then like just now you can like
<malay>apa</malay> rename yourself so if let's say but you can only rename yourself you cannot rename for others unless you're the
host I think
ya so I can rename myself like let's say I want #siti# instead
so #siti# ya and then other basic things is (err) okay if you're the host or the co-host right you have the options to record
so record is just you <malay>boleh tengok balik</malay> [lah] the recording
okay so you can choose between like (err) record on your laptop or record on cloud
record on cloud means on your Zoom account which I which I prefer cause if you if you record <malay>macam macam</malay> that time I conduct my master classes right
and then I had to record the classes
[ah] I chose
the first mistake was I chose (uh) to record on on my laptop and it became a whole two hours plus footage
<malay>macam</malay> movie <malay>gitu</malay>
(mm) so so I had to I had to
<malay>apa</malay>
find a way to upload that huge file to make sure everybody can see it then <malay>susah</malay> [lah]
ya then <malay>lepas tu</malay> I just (um) I tried out (uh) record on cloud
and it will just record on your Zoom account and then you can just send the link
then <malay>orang akan</malay> just
ya <malay>orang akan</malay> be direct redirected back to the to the Zoom
(mm) ya
and then some basic things like chat
chat [ah] okay cause <malay>ni tak ada</malay> participants <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] so
(mm) then you know you can change (err) to everyone <malay>ataupun</malay> to a specific person
(mm) <malay>tak boleh</malay>
<malay>takleh</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>ada orang cakap yang</malay> like what like the host who
no but but it depends like like it hasn't been proven even I'm the host (uh) even when I host meetings right I cannot really see
ya so I don't know I don't know if it's true but just to be safe I don't like saying anything like nasty things about my lecturer <malay>kat dalam kelas</malay> [lah] ya
so ya usually
so it will have like a button here and the to everyone then they will have like a a small button here which (err) will have like a I think downwards button and then you can just pick
(uh) instead of everyone there's like person [ah] other people's name all the participants' name [lah] then they will have like bracket privately
so make sure you bracket privately then when you send a message [kan] you have to make sure <malay>yang apa</malay> you you click back to everyone
if if you want to talk to everyone else ya
ya
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] sometimes get confusing cause the messages your private messages and your messages (uh) your and messages <malay>apa</malay> to everyone
it will be altogether
ya so you just have to <malay>macam baca betul-betul</malay> [lah] like which one is everyone which one is to you only
(mm) ya but that's just like
usually when I want to like ask my friends something then I'll just like click to <malay>apa</malay> to to my friend [ah]
(mm) other than that there's breakout rooms but I don't think you'll be a host anytime soon cause you don't even know how to
operate Zoom
ya breakout rooms is just
breakout rooms is just (uh) <malay>macam tadi</malay> you experience that smaller rooms right so basically let's say you have a participant of <malay>macam</malay>
forty people
<malay>lepas tu orang tu nak</malay> breakout into smaller groups to do group work
so I will just
<malay>macam</malay> create let's say two rooms
and then like as a host I will just break up the rooms but as a participant <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>tengah tengah tengok</malay>
I'll just be like (err) there will just be a notification that pops out (uh) proceeding to breakout rooms something like that then you just wait [lah]
and it automatically will be changed to
your breakout room
(mm)
(mm) I guess so [lah] but like
cause
cause for adults I don't think you guys <malay>pakai</malay> much like for meetings only right and during meetings also you don't really talk much like you let your boss
ya but like students we always have to tutorials then like when tutorials you have to talk to get participation marks <malay>apa</malay>
I get
ya so if you like (uh) if you're a host then you can schedule meeting so like let's say <malay>macam</malay> I conduct my fundraising master classes [kan] the other time I will I will schedule a meeting and I'll just pick the time the date and then
yes
yes this is my the one I send on email
ya then I on the day itself you can just (err)
it will just be somewhere here [lah]
like ya
(mm) I think it's better than <malay>apa</malay> what's the other option the outlook is it live live
google meet or live outlook something like that [lah]
(mm)
so like let's say if you schedule a meeting then it will just be my personal then you just copy and send to people [lah]
(mm)
but just now you had you had something on
<malay>ada apa</malay>
team bonding in this COVID period how is that ya but like it's not time for you to bond with your team hello
but it's so <malay>susah</malay> just now
(mm) but I think like
wait so how did it go just now
no but like but like what was your <malay>apa</malay> what were the activities that you do and everything
escape room <malay>ada</malay> virtual
I <malay>tak</malay>
I <malay>tak pernah pergi</malay> [lah] but like how so so what must you do in that escape room
no as in like what is the objective of a escape room
the objective is just to escape the game room using the mysteries [lah]
<malay>cakap</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi susah tak</malay>
[ah]
no but like what were you trying to find out in the poem
[ah]
<malay>apa</malay> it's the starting of the
[oh]
I mean technically it's in the poem also [what] so like even if you <malay>baca</malay> like
but then how long were you given to do the escape room
that's a long time
but this is done by the escape room <malay>punya punya</malay> company [lah]
[oh] so like the facilitators like bought this escape room and then cause like they had you had a separate facilitator <malay>macam</malay> team bonding facilitator right
!huh!
the gavin (err)
but they were like from some motivational slash team bonding organisation [what]
[oh] then the escape room is they create or what
cause cause got my for my global studies <malay>punya apa</malay>
welfare pack [kan] everything is online now [what] so we have like a series of wait do you know what welfare welfare pack
no it's like <malay>macam</malay> okay basically if it's physical [kan] in school then they will give you like nearing to exams [lah] <malay>macam</malay> your <malay>apa</malay> midterms or your final year then they will give you like (err) a literal goody bag
then inside <malay>macam ada</malay> foolscap <malay>ada</malay> snacks <malay>ada</malay> like ya then like all these are like
usually free stuff so like you will source out from
(err) <malay>apa</malay> get
what what's that called when you ask someone for
free stuff [ah]
promote [ah] sponsorship [ah] sponsorship ya so you ask for like you ask this company for sponsorship [lah] but usually like if it's a bigger scale like what like your whole faculty <malay>punya</malay> goody bag then it's usually easier but like for us cause we are just a small <malay>apa</malay> faculty group [kan]
then we have to like ask around like all the different organisation that we want to partner up with [lah] so like we actually ask escape room like the organisation itself not organisation the company escape room you know I think you've been there before right ya
then they said like (err) cause I think now COVID they cannot
okay I'm not sure whether they cannot go in like to play the physical [one] or something like that but like
<malay>tapi lima orang apa</malay>
maybe maybe ya then they
in the end they were like okay we give you the sponsorship but (um) is to try out our <malay>apa</malay>
mobile app
ya but then the thing is the mobile app is only for android people and they they said okay if you can gather (um) if I'm not wrong thirty thirty pairs of people to play this game then we will give you the sponsorship like a I think ten dollars off or something like per escape
(um) room <malay>punya</malay> fee
no no no as in like cause if you if you go escape room usually got you have to pay [what] to go inside the escape room
no no no okay so so like for for for us is that
they will ask you to get a certain number of people it's like a trial run <malay>dulu</malay> [lah]
I think it's thirty pax or is it or is it thirty people then fifteen pairs
something like that [lah]
<malay>tak tak tak kita</malay> play for free cause they just they just want to see if you can get the people or not
cause the main point of sponsorship is you <malay>nak orang</malay> (uh) you want to get as many attention as you want as much attention as much attention as you want [what] [kan] ya
so then you ya then after that you just have to like
you have to source out for the for the people [lah] but in the end we couldn't cause it was only for android <malay>punya</malay> phone
ya exactly then we were like
it's a bit
ya cause they said their software developer like only develop for android then I'm like
then we were like
okay like we tried [lah] we tried to ask but even within our own EXCO group only one person use android of like eight people
so so hard then a lot of our friends also don't like even when I ask my friends also they all don't use android so be like I think in the end we couldn't get the sponsorship cause it was just
no but they had a
they had an age limit below thirty five
ya
but then it was just so hard and then after that we were like
and then cause at first they tried to <malay>apa</malay>
divide the welfare pack the E it's called like E welfare pack or something like that [lah] like basically E-vouchers so it's just a
a document full of vouchers that you can use
(mm)
and then like initially I wanted to
(uh) produce like three different
E-vouchers for <malay>apa</malay> three different three different categories <malay>macam</malay> welfare [eh] welfare <malay>pula</malay> beauty (uh) food and <malay>macam</malay> activities [lah] like yoga and everything
but like the sponsorship rate was the the turnover the turnover was like just so low then in the end <malay>macam</malay> I think they just decided
to produce one instead
ya so it's a bit sad cause we tried to <malay>macam</malay> we tried to
engage in home-based businesses
<malay>tapi tu pun susah</malay>
like it was supposed to be
release
[oh] it supposed to be released now but then cause like there was a lot of (uh)
<malay>apa</malay> delays and everything a lot of the sponsorships <malay>tak</malay> reply cause COVID <malay>sekarang</malay> then even their organisations not doing well <malay>apa</malay> the companies not doing well
like even like activity <malay>punya</malay> entertainment places <malay>pun tak</malay> not
they open [lah] but I mean who would goes to all these entertainment places right
ya
so like
we in the end
(err) we pushed back to week thirteen I think week thirteen is about like six november
ya it's quite late
but
ya then now I just finished my fundraising <malay>punya</malay> series [oh]
we collected a total of
okay I don't know what's the exact number but
I think almost reach six hundred dollars
!woohoo!
ya our target was four hundred dollars
ya then then even if four hundred dollars at first <malay>macam kita</malay>
we just like no confidence [ah] <malay>macam</malay> it's so <malay>susah</malay>
four courses [a'ah]
(err) each courses minimally
I think ten people each let me see
no but the thing is okay like like one of my (um)
(uh) members in that EXCO group like he gave like constructive criticism [lah] he was like you you pass the target but then like a lot of people also <malay>macam</malay> donate in bulks [what] like you and mama
donate like seventy dollars right
ya no as in as in but
seventy per cent seventy per cent <malay>pula</malay> seven dollars out of like our total is still quite a lot [what]
you get what I mean it's like
ya
ya then like some of my friends also donated like seventy dollars like their mum and them like donate seventy dollars so I think total about
three of you like make up like half not half [lah] like maybe one third of it
no but but
ya but the thing is it's like
the main point is to gain as much audience as possible [what] it's not to rely on like
just you <malay>sorang</malay> [jer]
[kan] so like that's what he said [lah] he was like ya you you managed to to hit your target ya but then
like
(mm) but ya not not there yet not as
(mmhmm) (mm)
ya then we're like that's quite true [lah]
(um) no but like
the first class is cooking class second class is makeup third is [oh] third is excel and forth is (um)
<malay>apa</malay> embroidery the worst was makeup cause I think <malay>macam</malay> is so common like everybody can just watch YouTube tutorials
so so that [one] a bit but in the end (err) a lot of my EXCO just join in last minute so to the person teaching the makeup class <malay>macam</malay> it's not that bad [lah] ya
cause it was still <malay>macam ramai</malay> then she was like [oh] my god didn't expect this much this many people and then I'm like [oh] [ha] [ha] [ha] <malay>nasib baik</malay> cause there's only like
three people <malay>yang</malay> sign up ya and it was very no three three or four people <malay>yang</malay> sign up
ya it was it was quite hard
I think also cause
like (err) in our faculty there was there's another group
[oh] by the way I won a giveaway from them
from the faculty <malay>punya</malay> group
ya it's a just a makeup set [lah] ya
ya and then after that the most popular was the excel class which did you
[oh] ya I send did you receive
ya then
no but
overall but I think he's the nicest he's the nicest person ever like
[oh] at first he I don't really know him but I just <malay>tahu pasal</malay> he lives in my for
ya
not not like as close friends whatever it's more of acquaintance <malay>macam</malay> I saw his (uh)
I saw his poster inside the inside the lift the other time <malay>pasal</malay>
[ah] this excel course [lah] <malay>pastu</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> and I wanted to join that time <malay>tapi</malay> I had something on that day so I couldn't make it
and now I was like but but but I I remembered thinking that it's such a good course [lah] ya
and then fast forward (err)
I was <malay>dengan tengah</malay> planning for this fundraising I was thinking like (hmm) like what other interesting courses would people be interested in
then I thought <malay>macam</malay> I think
like
(err) <malay>apa</malay>
not hands-on <malay>macam</malay> very practical skills that people would need <malay>macam</malay> in their workplaces in their school right
ya but
ya then after that I I ask him [lah] I was like [oh] will you be interested [oh] I ask his number from my friend and then after that [ah] I just ask him would you be interested and that was my first time talking to him I think
ya
and then
he was just like ya sure sure <malay>lepas tu</malay> I I went to find out (err) he thought the class was like he was conducting the class for the somali refugees
then I was like no it's not then I was like [oh] my god so <malay>kesian</malay> then he was like no no it's fine I was like okay
[ah] but ya it's just it's
<malay>dah</malay> I told him already but
I told him in the in like a whole group of like other volunteers
but I think he didn't really like
read properly something like that but ya but ya I told him he was like no no it's fine
but his class was like over
two and half cause the maximum <malay>kita anuh</malay> is
(uh) two hours only
ya
two and half hours
ya and like we started at eight
so he he was like
talking for
ya two and half hours straight he was talking and he don't even take a break he given ya
and then he was so nice he makes like (uh) extra class notes and he even like answered (err) post like questions that people were like asking afterwards after class everything
yes
[oh] but he's really really smart he has like
double double degree
and he he intern in like
and like
ya and he
[oh] he was (err) he was chosen for and Facebook or something like that like I know like (uh) ya
prestigious one [lah] but then
but he in the end he chose like I think ya
cause he's a business student engineering student
(mm) really [meh]
(mm) okay [lah] ya I guess
but he's really smart I'm just like !wow!
how is someone that smart
ya
<malay>esok ada apa</malay>
soft launch soft
soft launch for what
[oh] the Staple B is it
actually I don't even know what's <malay>abang</malay> doing

so it's it's just plain rice chicken <malay>dengan</malay> just different sauce
fragrant white
right
but it's like is it meant to be healthy or like
[oh]
what else is inside his dish like it's just chicken and rice it's a bit like plain no
but I saw the pictures it was quite nice
ya
it's at #novena#
<malay>mana</malay> [seh]
I don't know I just go #novena# <malay>untuk</malay> (err) skin centre
so is that good
[oh]
ya but the soft launch <malay>abang nak buat apa</malay>
how is going to earn from that
[ah]
but it's a a like you know like stall in in a food court <malay>ke</malay> in a
in a shopping mall <malay>ke</malay>
so food court [lah]
that's basically a food court
(mm)
that's a food court
okay [lah] like <malay>atas atas punya</malay> food court cause I heard like there's <malay>apa</malay>
there's like a bar right
ya like it's a
a hawker semi bar kind of place ya
(mm) no but I just do my assignments like I'm swamp with assignments now
(err) <malay>pasal</malay> it's this semester is all online [kan] I didn't even step in school like for one moment
[ah] it's focus more if your if your room is conducive [lah] but
no but like
I don't know like I felt I felt like you get burnout quite easily if you
stay at home a lot and cause for me I don't even go out at all [what] I never go out to study I didn't even go out like back to school to like cause all my friends
(err) go back to school to study <malay>apa</malay>
no at first cannot <malay>sekarang dah boleh</malay>
but <malay>jauh</malay>
no but like over there I guess it's conducive quite a little bit conducive I don't know I don't know but
but like
so many places
where you tell me where
you <malay>boleh</malay> #tampines# hub is the most not conducive environment ever
like I don't even know how people study in #tampines# hub
it's so <malay>bising</malay> you ever went there before
the basement [kan] you're talking about the basement right
it's so <malay>bising</malay> like the there's a playground I mean if you go there like two that you know that kind of like hours like no more shops then okay [lah] understand but like
ya the is twenty four hours [what]
ya I mean how can people go inside without going inside the area
ya
but it's not conducive and then people study like outside <malay>yang kat atas semua</malay> it's so hard
[oh] no cause COVID then now they
[oh] but library now they open
I think
#bugis# the national library and like some bigger national libraries like #tampines# library they open like
for two hours
like you can stay for cause before this is just half an hour
but now you can stay for two hours
then but then you still have to book a slot online [lah]
but like two hours <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>sikit</malay> if I want to study there
ya and then <malay>nak nak nak belajar kat luar pun</malay>
like I don't mind studying outside but
some establishments <malay>macam</malay> Coffee Bean they have no no laptop policy like cause they know a lot of people like going out to
to study and do their work right
ya and then like
no but do you understand the concept of burnout it's like it's still I don't know how to explain but like
like when you just
sometimes you just need a change of environment ya
that's what you said cause you go to office twice a week
so that's still okay
is [oh] my god I feel like I'm just my whole twenty four seven I'm just seated here
that doesn't change my that [one] my setting
but ya I already have let me see I think I already have
most of my assignments are due soon
like
a total I have I have a total of
one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
ten more
but I finish four already
so I've six more major exams (err) assignments to do
six
all different [lah] so one I got like twenty eight october one nine november one thirteen november one sixteen november no two sixteen november and I got I still got my final exam
twenty third
<malay>tapi</malay> it's a take home so it's like twenty four hours
twenty four hours [ah]
but that's the worst like I did that for my previous exam (err) my job <malay>punya</malay> module
cause they know we have twenty four hours and you have like the liberty to <malay>cam</malay> use all these
your laptop <malay>semua</malay> [kan]
it was super hard mummy
it was like
I couldn't even answer the questions
everyone was like
exact ya it's open book
so it's like you know I tried googling the answer okay and I just like my god how do I even answer this question
but ya and then I got B for that
contact
can [lah] but like
it's an exam who who wants to share your answer with you you get what I mean
cause I don't have friends that mob what like unless you have your friends then I guess like advice to help you [lah] but
even if you have friends <malay>macam</malay>
#paiseh# [kan] <malay>nak tanya</malay>
like it's not not
#neh#
no but it was
it was so much time [lah] I actually spent
over thirteen hours straight on the exam
!huh!
<malay>cakap apa</malay>
no [lah]
no
I mean you can give clues like he can tell us everything but ultimately it's like the way he phrases the questions and everything is
is very hard to answer
cause he purposely like professors are smart mummy like they know that you you are first thing you are firstly smart
ya then
then they know you have all these resources then obviously they don't they won't have like a question be like
[oh] you look at
exactly ya
so it's usually like like <malay>apa</malay> a combination of (err) topics
ya and then you just set the question like what
ya
[oh] no but
but one thing bad about online school was that (err)
[orh] okay at least for my faculty you have no exams at all except this exception one module [lah] but
[ah] generally across all the modules in my faculty you have like
very very little exam and then it's all replaced by assignments which I thought <malay>macam lebih lebih bagus</malay> [ah]
no the answer is no
[oh] that's the mistake that's the mistake of a of a freshman student that's a mistake of someone who has never taken full a non exam module okay so last sem I took like three
(uh) non exam modules and two exams <malay>pastu</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> happy [lah] !yay! three three modules no exam
[ah] <malay>ambil kau semua</malay> submission at the same time cause usually
like (err)
if if you have two assignments or three assignments usually [lah] (err) the <malay>macam apa</malay> submission the deadline is
about the same so let's say
in this (uh) my first mod then my second mod right I have like (um) my first essay usually the first essay will be due around the same time
<malay>tak tahu kenapa</malay> [lah] but it's just like that [ah]
ya
yes no and cause it's assignments it's usually very okay let's say you have an exam you will just like
(um) let's say short answer question it's like less than five hundred words like you answer one question right
but an essay you have to write three thousand words minimum
no our
that's what you think
but the assignment like most of my assignments here (um) especially towards the end there will be this like one major like so all like consolidating <malay>nya</malay> assignment
so it would it will be like okay let's say I have this
at first I explain to you like [eh] it's really like a burden to all the uni students to have no exams
like just like I was like !yay! no exam fun [what] then my students were like no you will not lucky then I'm like !huh! why I never knew until I experience it
ya so like let's say I have this refugee policy <malay>punya</malay> mod
and my major (err)
my major <malay>apa</malay>
essay is I have to solve a policy problem and I have to write like
almost four K words [lah]
so you you <malay>bayangkan</malay> I have to do that and that's not my only module I have to do I have my other modules and top of modules I have readings to do readings which will help me in my modules
<malay>semua</malay> yes you see
two two of them are in sixteen november which two of these is my major [one]
and then two thirteen november okay then this [one] is okay [lah] relax [lah]
twenty eight october eighteen october you see it's all like about the same <malay>sama-sama</malay>
it's crazy ya that's why people always say like don't don't take
like it's gonna take non-exam mod at least take like one one or two [lah] but
you take three onwards it's crazy so this sem is like five of them
it's just insane
like all five modules of mine no exam [what] like all modules all assessments based
ya
so I was like
just screwing for like time [lah] then now I think
some period
<malay>macam</malay> now
now and
two [eh] no week six that's the crazy period [lah] cause that's the like now now is my #chiong# period all the way to
twenty third november
ya
that's one like technically technically you end faster [lah]
no it's not managing time it's okay it's like
how to say like
even if you manage your time properly right you will still need
ya the the amount of time you take to finish one essay right like you <malay>tak percaya</malay> you <malay>tanya kak</malay> #shima# the amount of time you take to finish one essay is like super long okay
that's that
there's the planning then you have to make sure like what you write is coherent you have to reference and then you have to find more sources that everything is so much easier to like just <malay>belajar</malay> for that one
(uh) like you <malay>belajar</malay> for certain period of time and then you just do exam for one day
then that's it
it's so much easier trust me ya I would totally prefer that
ya but now it's like a combination of both so it's even worse
ya
but
I just got my I just go my <malay>apa</malay>
(err) result for my which one
my four K mod and I got a A
ya
it was my first it was my first A yes for the semester
(mm)
<malay>apa</malay>
twenty third november <malay>baru</malay> end
ya
no but I won't I won't be getting like results for everything
cause you cannot the university policy is only like fifty per cent
you can reveal
then they just don't show you [lah]
ya
!huh!
[oh] no
no they will just give you like okay let's say you got three assignments [kan]
then cause different assignments is different weightages <malay>apa</malay>
let's say my first assignment is fifteen per cent my second assignment is so what is fifty minus fifteen
thirty five thirty five then the last one is fifty per cent right
so I will only receive my first two assignments
or I will receive my last assignment which is usually not the case [lah] cause of the last
cause fifty fifty per cent
they can only show results up to fifty per cent of your grade
that's the thing
like like I think it's cause <malay>macam</malay> they don't want to people to know the bell curve also
you know what's bell curve right ya
then cause if you know your fifty per cent okay let's say I got like A for everything
then my ultimate grade is a B plus
<malay>mesti</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> !huh!
like confirm I want to like
like ask the university all that [what] then I think they don't want [lah]
ya but
I guess it's it's okay [lah]
like
no but it's also like sometimes a a blessing I guess cause like you get like B B then like you work so hard on your last one then you don't know right so like when we <malay>dapat</malay> results you <malay>macam</malay>
(mm) will I get a B or A and then you'll think you will get a B you know like A and then like okay
so so you know you did well on your last but you'll never know how well you did [lah]
ya
ya
it's like
<malay>lagi cepat</malay> stress
ya exactly exactly ya which is which is hard about uni [lah] I guess
cause you have to consistently do hard cause you never know
when it's like
ya when when you are going to do bad in it
which is why I want to do exchange to freeze my
cause when you freeze your then cause of my now is is okay [lah] I guess so like I don't want to make it drop anymore cause is I mean when you
you <malay>naik</malay> year three year four it gets harder and harder [what] you have to take harder modules [kan]
ya and then after that
I just want to <malay>macam</malay> freeze my [lah] so that it won't <malay>macam tak turun tak naik</malay> I mean I mean <malay>naik</malay> is possible it's very hard for you to <malay>naik</malay> [lah] honestly
ya <malay>tak turun</malay> [lah] basically
ya
ya maintain or don't drop
ya but COVID happened and then
my exchange to
(mm)
(mm)
okay cause they open up the
the
application again cause they said like [oh]
ya okay okay no cause they officially cancelled
(uh) our sem two [kan] sem two they cancelled
then they sent out email [lah] they said like [oh] like ya unfortunately unable to proceed cause there's still no cause they were I think
<malay>dorang nak tunggu</malay> vaccine
ya so like they were thinking if they like delay they hope there will be a vaccine that will come out already [lah] but unfortunately <malay>tak ada</malay> vaccine
so they said cannot [lah] like
I think only countries to europe
asia and
ya which is allowed I mean
most of the countries are from there [lah]
ya then they they said but they will extend cause the application for the next round <malay>punya dah</malay> actually <malay>dah tutup</malay>
but then they just <malay>buka balik</malay> then they said [oh] it's until [oh] it's two more days actually the deadline the due date
ya
then you said then they said you can apply but your just your application will just be like as though you're a new student so <malay>macam tak kira kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> you were accepted like me like in your exchange you will still have to like
go through everything again and like they will send to review your your grades and everything [lah]
but the thing is my
my major <malay>punya</malay> requirement is that
you have to finish these two mods consecutively
like in sem one and sem two consecutively cause it's like <malay>macam</malay> group work
ya exactly that's that's the thing that it's stopping us from going again [lah] cause if you go let's say you go
sem two my year three sem two
yes next year january
january but
no no no no so what they are opening now is my year four sem one sem two
okay so technically year four students you cannot go in your sem two so sem two is out [lah] I <malay>tak boleh pergi</malay> [lah]
(mm) so sem one but my course my my major <malay>ada</malay> this requirement that you <malay>kena ambil</malay> this particular module
like in sem one and sem two consecutively so <malay>kalau</malay> you miss out in sem one <malay>tak boleh ambil</malay> in sem two [jer] [tau]
you have to wait
you have to wait another year [lah] so you have to extend another year
which is why like we
we are trying to propose but
but okay you
okay but you try to think of something like try to think of a solution how it's quite it's quite impossible cause you cannot we firstly cannot ask them to do (um) online cause
time difference and I don't think it's possible cause (uh) you're it's actually taking
two (uh) <malay>apa</malay> different modules from two different universities
right
and then after that time difference also cause it's it's like a <malay>macam</malay> group work <malay>gitu</malay> ya
no it's not
ya which is why like we were we were okay we were okay with (um) just like (err) <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
(uh) doing online <malay>kalau boleh</malay>
but the thing is they don't they don't let
like they don't let if (uh)
they don't let
if you are <malay>apa namanya</malay> I lost my train of thoughts already <malay>ayah</malay> keeps calling
no I mean it's it's actually calling your it's actually calling <malay>pula</malay> it's actually trying to like
take two different (err) from two different schools <malay>macam macam mana</malay> you you can attend two different schools like it's at the same time some more
ya so that's like
I don't know but like we we're just trying our luck (lah) we just we just trying to ask but
I don't really have hope <malay>yang kita akan pergi</malay> [lah] cause it's ya it's quite hard
and then also like
you cannot do in sem like let's say I want to cause cause I can only do in let's say I go exchange in sem one right
then I can only do it in sem the module compulsory module in sem two
but
if I propose to take in my next sem instead my year three sem two
I cannot cause then (um) the organisation that we will that will work you
that will work with will be
but they have to wait one whole semester for us to continue working again which is <malay>macam tak baik</malay> [lah] like who which which organisation is nice enough to do that
and obviously the school will not allow it [lah]
but ya we just we just trying our luck
to propose
no <malay>kalau kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> one <malay>kalau</malay> one year then I won't [lah] like no and and it's not just them it's like
you have to pay eight K of money okay
ya
cause I'm not subsidised anymore [what] if I extend right
ya exactly then I was like okay it's okay especially when I don't think can [lah] which is damn unfair cause it's just like
the faculty I mean my major <malay>macam</malay> just extra want to have this module to be different cause now we are like interdisciplinary module everything
but I'm just like
exactly and it's like a whole
[eh]
it's a whole batch that is that is
like you don't allow them to go just cause of your the way you structure your
ya actually ridiculous [lah]
but ya
I don't know
I'm hoping to
but the the new application <malay>yang dorang kasi</malay> it's more
<malay>apa</malay> there's more options [ah]
so I don't know
but it's it's in two more days and I haven't
really
done my research so
<malay>kena</malay> submit <malay>lagi</malay> [ah]
yes
but it's not that much I think
ya
I just like I just have to fill
I just have to find and no but I cannot cause as in it's they only give they only open back for ten days
ya so it's impossible for us to get approval first [ah] so we just gonna submit first and then I will just email cause
if you submit you get accepted you can still reject <malay>apa</malay> and you and you won't
that that's the thing I said there's a lot of
there's more options now so have
like more options [ah] to choose from
maybe maybe not you okay [lah] no but but even if I go to a non
ya I was thinking of that
no but the thing is it's not the problem of COVID now [what] it's not the problem of whether I can go or not ya
just don't think I'll be able so sad
it's like your whole uni is like
you've been looking forward to this but <malay>nasib baik</malay> I I stay in dorm if not like I really like no uni life at all
what <malay>takde</malay>
know like <malay>kak</malay> #shima# stay in the hall everything
[oh] ya
two years
ya
ya luckily luckily I got
and that was even like
a last minute decision [what] remember
like for me to enter my my
but ya [oh] did you hear about the the sexual harassment case
don't know [lah]
but it's not
ya and they they filed police report [lah]
ya but no the thing is
what it what people are mad about is like <malay>macam</malay> the the college <malay>tak</malay>
they don't they don't <malay>dia tak</malay> relay <malay>apa-apa</malay>
(mm) like cause some people notice like
only after two weeks they reported <malay>baru ada</malay> like
actions or something like that like action taken towards the
the <malay>laki</malay> [lah]
then like people like
it took two weeks just to <malay>macam</malay> do something then that speaks a lot [what]
but apparently like they were doing like internal investigations all along but they just
they never like say anything [lah]
ya
ya and not
ya and then after that like
I don't know [ah] just like
just
ya then after that we were like
thinking what what can someone what can someone do
like
what can
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>ada ayah ni apa apa ayah nak ni</malay>
<malay>jap jap</malay> and then after that like they and then we were like
(uh) what can the person do
what can the what can the
what is it called organisation do then they release (err) a statement [lah] saying like [oh] increase our transparency and everything
and then after that
I guess okay now but
it's just a bad reputation for again yet again
which is bad like especially especially like sexual harassment case it's like
it's such a big thing and you
I don't know [lah] look but
no but the thing is that the thing about
(um) my school is that
the spotlight has has is already on us cause we're like the top university everything right
and then like just cause of that even though like other sexual harassment activities happened in other universities like not much attention is placed on them just cause like like you know <malay>macam</malay> sensation [lah] like the media just wants to like keep on (uh) saying [oh] again
and then the last like
you know it happens and some people actually think like [oh] like it only happens in everything but
it's wrong like
sexual harassment happens everywhere it's just cause that media chooses to portray us in this light cause we're like top and everything
which is a bit ridiculous [lah]
no but but in but <malay>kita punya</malay> people keep saying my uni right you know in other universities it's worst but but it just don't hear reports right
but it's worst
cause we have friends there where we know what's happening there we have ties with organisation like the clubs there obviously we know
like in singapore it's not so big also
ya
report [lah] like reports do happen that's the thing
ya exactly which is what I'm saying they don't they don't report it in the media
you get what I'm saying it's the media
yes it's reported but but nothing is reported in the media
cause the sensation is just on us
ya
so I don't know
it's just
it's a it's a very controversial topic [ah]
like everytime another one comes and then like (uh) yet again but like in like before
before that like before another case pops up another case already pops up in another uni but you don't hear from them also cause like like the media doesn't cover that [what]

<malay>dia baru balik</malay> jordan for (um) <malay>untuk</malay> <malay>apa</malay>
(err) <malay>mengetahui lagi</malay> (uh) <malay>lebih lanjut dia punya pengetahuan sebagai ustad</malay> [lah] like
he wants to become an <malay>ustad</malay> you know because his family is really really pious well he came from a pious family
but then one day he fell in love with a

idealistic
[oh] what about me
[oh]
[ah] okay my full name is rismawati binti razlan people will call me #rismah# #ris#
(uh) I hate I really really hate to be called #wati#

<malay>macam makcik-makcik punya nama</malay> you know like <malay>bibik</malay> #wati# no please no I mean only only my families can but not my friends okay not

okay (um) like I said I'm eighteen this year I'm (uh) I'm taking floristry as my course
and I'm having an internship (uh) by this september
<malay>insyaallah</malay>
<malay>sampai</malay> december and I'll be graduating already and I think I'm planning to take (um) maybe
(err)
like higher NITEC or because I'm still NITEC so I think I'm taking in higher NITEC or
maybe poly
but
I'm not so sure first [lah] (uh) [ah] like (um) I have to plan everything first and
you know move on from there
but (um) as for now I think
(err) talking about language (err) languages [ah] I can speak <malay>macam biasa melayu</malay>
(um) then after that (um) english english my my english is not like my brother's english
(um) because his english is like really fluent
but mine is (um) just normal like (um) I don't really know how to speak english that well but
you know you know like don't know like how to say [ah] like I know how to speak english but then
I don't know some words I have like I still have a long way
to go to to you know to to know a new word
to use
and indonesian (um)
of course my brother can speak really fluent but me
I can my indonesian is really really rusty
like I can just speak a bit but I understand what other people say when they're in they talk in indonesian
ya that's one thing about me and (um)
I think about that [ah] I think [ah] other than that
there's nothing more I guess
(err)
like

then <malay>nanti</malay> you <malay>nak tengok cerita apa</malay>
[oh] that's some random thriller show right
what you mean bridge the cursed bridge
so is the cursed bridge
so it's about a bridge
I don't know now got what movie
can we watch the hunt
intruder we already watch
Greenland
want to see this one of the worst show in the world
Greenland <malay>apa lagi</malay>
to be honest <malay>kan</malay> I don't know how they record
like how they record these movies
like during this pandemic
like <malay>macam mana macam mana dia orang</malay> record
how
during a lockdown
what do you mean okay let's say the average amount of time needed
to make a film
is a year okay is a year
so okay let's say they start the production in
august
august last year
so then <malay>tiba tiba kerja</malay> continue continue continue then (err)
april [kan] lockdown
okay so from august to april
let's say they recorded like sixty percent of the show
okay
then how what happen to the forty percent like how they record it
is more of editing
make sense
but what if they start recording okay <malay>tak apa</malay> [ah] then that means the movie wouldn't be out [what]
ya cause it's a shit show
ya
okay you think about it
girl wants to be a guy
but she wants to fight
so don't fight if you can't fight
no
it looks stupid
no
I mean <malay>pernah</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> let's say like you know you're scrolling through the channel [kan]
then <malay>macam</malay> [oh] disney channel then got #mulan# then <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] then like [oh] whatever
then there's this one stupid dragon and small dragon with all the
all the ancestors
the father
ya then the I think like was it because of the dad <malay>macam rasa</malay>
disappointed <malay>pasal anak dia perempuan</malay> so <malay>tak ada orang yang boleh</malay> carry on
[oh] so which #mulan# have I been watching
but my story line makes more sense
okay like let's say okay if let's say your father
was a soldier and cannot go to the war would you go
for the war on the behalf of your father
no you won't you won't exactly you won't
why would #mulan# do that
what do you mean by no choice
I think I watched [lah] but I don't remember [lah] [kan]
no the thing is
okay
no no no no no no we're talking about #mulan#
so #mulan# [kan]
she wants to
go for the war
she has to go for
okay what do you mean by <malay>terpaksa</malay> because if she's <malay>terpaksa</malay> [kan] okay at first she's a guy [eh] she's a woman
woman is not required to go for this [one] [what] this [one]
ya woman cannot go
but then why is she forced to go
[oh] okay okay okay I
ya
okay
okay
why
so if let's say everyone is a girl
okay
makes sense makes sense makes sense makes sense
<malay>tak tak pernah tengok</malay> that's like okay I watched the movie but I don't know what the hell the movie is about
I watched before
<malay>dia</malay>
no no no I watched already you see
#mulan# go fight fight fight fight fight then she sick
then she go see this ice
place then (err)
she she <malay>sakit</malay> then she <malay>baring</malay> I think sick or whatever I don't know
then the
[ah] sick
so after she got sick
then she lie down then the doctor check check check (err) then the tell the main emperor emperor prince
coy commander (err) leader [ah]
[meh] she's a she's a girl
ya that that's the movie [what] right
she got caught in the
okay but then the most important she got caught at the ice place
by by who
#hans#
so is #mulan# like
based on the real life
<malay>orang tengah berbual pasal</malay> #mulan#
let's finish the #mulan# first [lah]
haven't
okay okay then how about that dragon
with the
#wushu# finger
kung fu panda
okay okay okay okay #wushu#
#wushu#
okay #wushu# then the ancestor how is that
got to do with any cultural
significance
why not
why I just help me understand
no you make me make me understand #mulan# first then I'll make you understand #aladdin#
what do you mean I know that she got caught at the ice place
cause she got shot not got sick
okay why she go to the war
okay so
[oh] so even okay the dad <malay>tak boleh pasal dia sakit</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> in the in that government even though <malay>kau sakit ke apa</malay> [eh] sorry
even though if you <malay>sakit</malay>
okay even if you <malay>sakit</malay> or not <malay>tak kisah</malay> you have to go is that the rule
so the the #mulan# <malay>dia macam kasihan</malay> [kan] that's why she left that note
(oo) makes sense
nineteen sixty five [eh]
!wow! that's about eighteen twenty three man
so what do you want to know about #aladdin#
okay [ah] honestly I think it's stupid [ah] because
okay because
she don't let me drink water [ah]
cause he
cannot [meh]
then you want me talk for one hour no drink [ah]
!huh!
okay
<malay>dia pasal</malay>
this one guy

it was just like <malay>macam</malay>
how to say [eh]

there's that one guy okay [lah] <malay>kita gini</malay> [ah] then everyone <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] go [ah] no problem <malay>macam</malay> yes
so there's that one leader in that group
and there's one joker in a group
usually the joker is either small or fat
[kan] it's always like that joker is always small size or fat
yes
<malay>gemuk</malay>
actually when the robot <malay>tu dengar gemuk</malay>
then the robot <malay>dengan</malay> <malay>dengar apa benda dia ni bual pasal gemuk</malay>
okay
so ya there's leader <malay>ni</malay>

all out [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>buat buat benda benda bodoh</malay>
I don't know [ah] got there's just a lot of stupid thing I did in secondary school
then <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>pernah</malay> you know sports day
that time my year one <malay>punya</malay> sports day was during <malay>puasa</malay>
so <malay>kita main</malay> frisbee
then my class was just winning like every single game [ah]
I don't know how
[kan] okay <malay>dia punya</malay> frisbee <malay>punya</malay> court [kan] <malay>dia macam</malay> let's say okay there's one triangle [kan]
okay you imagine this triangle [eh]
then you draw two lines inside
so this is the field this is the goal this is the goal so maybe you just throw to your team mate that's in this (uh) right rectangle he score
so what my team did
<malay>kita</malay> okay my rule [kan] at that game okay <malay>dia</malay> I think is seven versus seven or something like that
so
I will just in the middle again all I had to do
was to capture that intercept the frisbee from the opponent
okay
so once you okay let's say I scoring this [eh] I scoring here [eh]
so I <malay>kat tengah tengah main main main ambil</malay> frisbee [kan]
I will throw to one guy at the back
this one guy at the back
just throw to him
then this guy will just throw the frisbee to daniel you <malay>kenal</malay> daniel [lah] [kan]

ya but daniel [lah]
and then catch and we win
every time [oh] just like that <malay>gitu gitu gitu</malay> pass <malay>belakang gitu dah</malay>

yeah I'm just my friend is just to find a jobs [lah] flexible part time jobs you know to suit my schedule especially like my intern is not paid right <malay> abih kena cari kerja sendiri [lah]
then what about you
<malay> asal boring what you doing at home
(hmm)
yes it almost three years already and we are gonna graduate next year <malay> tak sabar rasanya
I don't know [seh] I'm scared that I just hope that it will have that graduation ceremony [lah] if not we will be like the this year batch right they graduate through Zoom or Teams [ah]
yeah I know right will you miss school !duh!
stress [kan] <malay> kena buat ni semua but I'm glad <malay> macam its all over already [lah] now [dah] holiday <malay> boleh enjoy
but I'm glad it's all over already [lah] no the holiday where they enjoy
so what have you been doing ever since the holiday
<malay> apa was the assignment about !duh!
<malay> apa itu I tak faham
yeah I see
[ah] for this semester
(err) so far only <malay> satu je [lah] like one module (err) we learn about airport management it's quite interesting [lah] cause you get to learn about the operations behind a airports right like how the run or what what other things involved yeah
[oh] my dream job is to be stewardess [lah] like cause <malay> macam you know that time the first time I took a flight to #penang# then the stewardess served me right then from there I was like inspired I want to be like them
so from there <malay> macam I work hard [lah] to you know I do research about aviation about stewardess all these
then get I get to poly this aviation course
but now a bit sad [lah] because COVID then aviation sector like
#rabak# [lah]
yeah that was one of my dreams <malay> tapi macam susah [lah] <malay> nak jadi pilot you need a lot of qualification yeah so now I just want to be a stewardess first [lah] I see [lah] if
I want to work at singapore airlines [lah] but <malay> banyak orang cakap susah nak masuk [ah] because high standard <malay> semua so now I looking for maybe other travel budget airlines like the Scoot or Jetstar asia
why
but okay [lah] we see how maybe I can go in maybe not I don't hope so much but I just hope the only hope I want is to be a stewardess [lah] I don't mind actually which airline as long as I get to as long as I get the dream job I'm working
what's your plan to do what's your plan tomorrow
[oh] <malay>sekarang ni</malay> I I <malay>tengah tengok drama</malay> korea [ah] korea [ah] <malay>cerita lama</malay> [lah] <malay>cerita</malay> legend of the blue sea
yeah I watched that before I think that was in twenty sixteen or something around that year then I want to watch it again [lah] because its so nice yeah you should watch that
[ha] [ha] yes
yeah then [ah] do you want to watch a movie next week or something
train to #busan#
okay
just now I eat [ah] <malay> nasi with <malay> kari daging
what about you
!wah! <malay> sedap nya
<malay> boleh jugak your mom <malay> masak semua
<malay> macam hari raya pulak
[eh] you told me that [ah] she is going to stop working right
okay then how is your intern you got any updates
so you won't be alone [lah]
okay [lah] that's good [lah]
!chey! I thought you say like got maybe at least one more person with you at the same location so at least you won't be bored or you know
some more your house is at #tung lok kiew# right
and you are not familiar with place
its
it's still considered as internship [lah] because I'll be working with #changi# airport it just that I won't be getting salary [lah]
I think there will there's like another four people they'll be doing it with me yeah but then still sad [lah] because I got no salary then I have to find a the part time job to support myself
yeah I have one friend my classmate [lah] she also choose the same internship so I just hope that we'll be working together cause I don't want to work alone work alone
yeah but then like my other friends they <malay> banyak kena campak dekat (err) company <malay> yang tak related to aviation <malay> macam logistics then like some of them will be like under administration or marketing that kind of job
but they still get they still get paid like high salary [ah] like yesterday I asked my friend she said her salary will be eight hundred dollars and I'm like !wah! so lucky
yeah but for me it's too late for me to reject my internship [lah] because all the position close already so I'll have nowhere to go so I'll just have to accept that internship
yeah hopefully I can cope [lah] between the project and the job
<malay> belum susah cause <malay> aku tengah cari flexible or adhoc kind of job [kan] <malay> tapi mostly like they want you know minimum commitment three to four days a week that kind and like you know office hours yeah so hard [lah] I need to find a flexible one because I scared if they ask me to come to the #changi# airport then if I working the part time job then I cannot go there how you know so I need to prioritize my intern first
no who enjoy [seh]
why
for long [ah]
what !aiyo!
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
like the participation level for us very low and then we get you know sometimes get downgraded because of that so its like unfair
physical class
yeah but !wah! this semester my grades okay [lah] decent only [lah] its not the grade that I expected
yeah because because like I said [lah] like the participation never all actually I do participate but I just don't unmute my mic because I don't dare and like ya [lah] a bit <malay> takut [ah] when if you talk then you will talk alone
so how (err) how was
good [lah] was it a <malay> macam manageable or stressful
okay [lah] but it's quite hard [lah] to you know ask your friends or your faci then like through online cause no issue in the physical cause you ask your faci then he straight away come to you know like can get instant answer right but this one you need to write message or you call them sometimes so they busy doing things then they will reply like very late
so it's like
yeah correct [lah] better you by say then all your classmates listen right
okay so what's your plan after you graduate from poly
[oh]
same [lah] I also thinking like I want to go in uni but not sure what course should I take cause now COVID so I thinking of like taking something to back up me [lah] you know aviation may not be stable like even after COVID (err) finish
so maybe I'm thinking like taking up (err) finance or course cause like this I want to take a course that is like universal [lah] that accepted everywhere every industry so I feel like it will be safe for me
<malay> abih kau macam mana macam ada plans <malay> nak buat business [eh]
!wah!
I see like !wah! nowadays a lot of people do auction on Facebook
yeah
<malay>tak</malay> they see [eh] I see like they sell those gadgets you know like speakers [lah]
not sure I think some of them are brand new
yeah maybe then
now also people sell clothes [oh] now especially COVID they sell the mask you know they make themselves yeah
everywhere you can see that
so
what what do you want to sell like food or you know like retail stuff
[oh] muslim friendly cloths
yeah I also have plans to open up the cafe
yeah we should be partners
meal some
okay I actually have (err) thoughts [lah] like okay maybe this cafe is the small cafe I want to make it
you know of course like (err) nowadays students like to study outside like at Starbucks or you know those small cafe so I'm like inspired by that so I want to make a cafe that is cosy for them to study
but that cafe will have (err) it will start like serving you know just drinks or desserts drinks and desserts very small small [one] [lah] then you have like a space for them to study to relax you know have free wifi
for students to enjoy or even like adults [lah] those working adults they want to do their work there also can and then slowly you can introducing mains you know like appetisers mains and then maybe slowly expand to become a full cafe full a full
how to say that
like
open up like
just like the other cafes <malay> semua those that sell the mains all yeah
yeah true [lah]
<malay> sikit sikit lama lama jadi bukit
yeah so maybe by that time you know when it's successful then you can open a new outlets at other places
yeah this one also actually I I don't want it to be at somewhere <malay>ulu</malay> somewhere (err) a place people cannot find
you know like some cafes like in the <malay>ulu</malay> places right then people want to
like (err) it will be inconvenience for them [lah] you know especially those who have who don't have their
who don't have their own transport [lah] like car or motor then they wanted to take public transport you know some places very hard [lah] even if you take a bus or you still need to walk like fifteen minutes away you know
yeah yeah yeah
and cannot be <malay>ulu</malay> [lah] like I said
but I feel I feel like (err) cafes in the west is like
quite boring [ah]
like I said
[oh]
yeah we should sell like those viral food and drinks to attract people

ya three [ah] <malay>azan</malay> then I was like <malay>azan</malay> [eh] then because I look to the I look inside I look inside the forest then it was pitch dark
then I was like the only the only way this can be like real [ah] if there is a <malay>kampung</malay> beside [lah]
so I keep the story to myself first then the next day I ask #nos# [eh] #nos# beside <malay>yang tempat</malay> we <malay>pancing</malay> got <malay>kampung</malay> [ah] then <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] then I was like
[oh] <malay>tak ada</malay> [ah] <malay>pukul tiga pagi lepas aku tukar umpan</malay>
I heard <malay>ada macam ada orang tengah azan</malay> and I I stood there for quite some time [lah] just to make sure I'm hearing it correctly [lah] [eh] <malay>kau tak bilang</malay> [ah]
[oh] <malay>kau tak kejut aku</malay> then I was like <malay>apa nak kau jangka buat apa dah kat situ</malay>
ya then that that was the first story then the second time I wasn't there [ah] this [one] was #han# #han# and the rest went I I didn't went there
so he was like (um) <malay>tertidur</malay>
then he tried to sleep you know [ah] he always try to sleep when he <malay>pancing</malay> [one] then he try to sleep then he cannot sleep know then <malay>dia pusing pusing pusing</malay> then he he looked to the right
then you know that that place have you went to that place before there's like this big tree [lah] <malay>kat tengah-tengah</malay> in the middle of the open area then he wake up then he looked to his side
he was quite close to the tree [lah] then he saw one <malay>nenek</malay> one <malay>nenek</malay>
walk pass then he was like [ah] the <malay>nenek</malay> told him like #cu# #cu# <malay>dah tahu sini tempat keras</malay> [kan] <malay>asal malap</malay> [jer] <malay>di tempat</malay> you [eh] <malay>macam tempat</malay> you <malay>pula</malay> [eh] no no no not that
why why (um) <malay>malap</malay> [jer] <malay>tempat cucu ni tak bagus tahu malap-malap</malay> like he was just saying like is not good that the place that they was fishing is dim like because my friend usually he bring one big torchlight [lah] but that day he just never on it [lah] then
#han# already know [lah] he he got experience before then after that he knows that this [one] is
<malay>apa tu</malay> (err) <malay>macam</malay> this [one] is mystics [lah] like mystic mystic stuff so he was like
(um) like [oh] (err) then he just keep quiet [lah]
keep quiet then #rilek-rilek# then the <malay>nenek</malay> (um) turned and walked away walked into the forest or something like that [lah]
then he he knows already [lah] then he just stay awake [lah] then the next day the driver came [ah] came to pick them up
then the driver say got one time he was passing by [ah] at night [ah] then he actually saw at the <malay>pokok</malay> there <malay>ada</malay> (err) <malay>pocong</malay> [ah] <malay>tengah</malay>
so it it means that like that <malay>nenek</malay> come to actually warn them that that place very <malay>malap</malay> then got other stuff also [lah] then that that <malay>nenek</malay> just go there to warn them [lah] like be careful you see
ya is ya so but that place that place quite is is quite nice [lah] but it's just <malay>malam</malay> ya <malay>malam kena jaga-jaga</malay> ya
that that particular
(mm)
(mm)
but it's not from malaysia [lah] [oh] so they they hear all over
so loud
(mm)
maybe that that might explain but three in the morning testing mic [ah]
no no there was no building around us so is is like okay this [one] is where the driver will drive [eh] drive then this is an open area <malay>di sini ada satu pokok</malay> in the middle
then when you look out into the sea right you can see there's two paths that goes to the sea then if you go to the left
path [ah] actually the right path also can you will see <malay>pulut ketam</malay> in front of you that stretch like that [ah] towards the tip [lah] you can see the whole tip of #pulau ketam#
[ah] I think it's like fifteen minutes drive it's ten to fifteen minutes
ya ya ya if I'm not wrong because in the when we fish
in the morning when we wake up or is it we [ah] ya in the morning we fishing fishing fishing then the people all
sailing in front then we like no no don't don't then we see our rod move !alamak!
then you are literally pulling the kayak
ya balance things out [lah] !huh!
[lah] [kan] [eh]
then your past few days <malay>macam mana</malay> your past few months [ah] [ah] the time the last
time I met you then you say you just <malay>berhenti kerja</malay> [pe] you just stop work
(mm)
(mm)
but how many how many jobs have you applied for
so <malay>apa</malay> you you apply mostly what type of <malay>apa</malay> industry
what phone call [eh] <malay>kau cakap bahasa melayu sikit kau</malay> english all the way [eh] have you never notice beginning
then all the all the sentence all english
that's why
then (err)
so you apply for your job back to back to the story ya back to the <malay>cerita</malay> so <malay>kau dah</malay> apply <malay>kerja habis semua tak dapat</malay> [ah] all all rejected you
ya [lah]
ambassador
okay is that's that's north right
central (err) [ah] ya
(mm)
within the week
within the month
ya
ya [lah]
<malay>sakit hati</malay> [ah]
surrounding surrounding
surrounding have a few other <malay>masjid</malay> in the east
[ah] okay I think I I understood
okay okay
because of that
[ah]
so what you did you tell anyone no [ah]
but but whose that middle person
(mm)
then different different person
(mm)
#fandi ahmad#
!wah!
(mm)
(mm)
ya that's why [lah] is
no [lah] I think this kind of things right is where you as a person who have experience have background <malay>juga</malay> [kan]
you will need to come in and explain to them [oh] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] this the way the reason why I <malay>letak</malay> the moderator first then followed by the asatizah</malay> then followed by (err) #fandi ahmad# is because
(um) according to my knowledge in the industry like I took diploma and whatsoever (uh) I know that first <malay>kau kena letak</malay> the moderator first
why why why the moderator first <malay>pasal dia yang akan</malay> moderate everything then followed by the <malay>asatizah</malay> who are
who will be the one main speakers [ah] who would be the main speakers in the
in the forum itself then #fandi ahmad# at the back because he's just a guest maybe you you can explain it like that [lah]
[ah]
game [lah]
(mm)
a caricature [lah]
no [lah] to me I guess is in it really boils down to people's knowledge and also how flexible they are in this type of <malay>macam situasi</malay> [lah]
(mm)
but this is but this [one] is what is considered as a volunteering or are they paying you
say you wanted to help [ah]
ya
ya that's why [lah] that's not like you said [lah] is <malay>tak</malay> professional [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya [lah]
(mm) ya is a
of course is the comic [lah] because it shows that things are being brought down to your level itself it's not that you your age group <malay>akan dibawa naikkan</malay> to the adult level so you know that
when you go you will experience things that <malay>dalam kamu punya</malay> age group [lah] so it's better for you in that sense [ah]
[ah]
yes
ya
ya and also actually I I actually salute people who do freelance photography and everything because the camera <malay>dah berapa mahal</malay> then (err) the time you took to edit I actually
<malay>pernah</malay> I <malay>pernah</malay> help you out with the edits even though I got no knowledge [ah] <malay>tentang</malay> video [ah] the video that
the video that I recorded the video that I recorded was for one of my internship [lah] then after that then <malay>apa tu</malay> the thing is
<malay>kenapa tak ada</malay> any background in Photoshop <malay>ke apa ke</malay> so <malay>nak</malay> edit <malay>tak tahu macam mana nak</malay> edit so I ask you for help that time
then after that then the way I see you edit [ah] !aduh! is just to edit like a one minute sequence like
that [one] was one minute that video was one minute itself and it took us what three days just to edit one minute
and the thing is it wasn't like per say it was <malay>tak susah</malay> because <malay>tak banyak</malay> animation <malay>tak banyak</malay> at that time [lah] it's just
trying to put two videos together to match the sequence <malay>itu pun dah boleh jadi gila</malay>
then ya I understand because as a programmer <malay>nanti</malay> I do some programs <malay>ke apa</malay> and I mean some more I'm getting paid know because I'm an intern
later <malay>dah dah buat setengah jalan nanti</malay> [eh] #hakim# (um) actually the client <malay>tak suka</malay> (uh) this part of the game [ah] can change it then <malay>dalam hati aku macam</malay> what it took me hours to get that part working
the way you wanted it now you say the client don't want it
so I need to change and then I need to figure out I need go and research <malay>tengok</malay> whether <malay>apa tu apa yang</malay> client <malay>tu nak</malay> is feasible <malay>tak</malay> can it be included
into the program itself <malay>macam</malay> the way the mechanics works and everything then I need time so [oh] <malay>sakit</malay>
definitely [lah]
[eh] feelings feelings
say goodbye
<malay>dengar cerita</malay>
true story actually <malay>sebelum ni banyak cerita dah cakap</malay>
#sulaiman#
no [lah] is is just <malay>pelik</malay> [lah]
tolong</malay>
<malay>malam jumaat</malay>
so
I must I must say that it's not we start the day is we start the night but our night is not the day the day
[oh]
<malay>dah</malay> start <malay>merepek</malay>
(err) podcast
you know the back to the story <malay>sikit</malay> right just now I talk about my intern so my intern [kan] I was being paid (err) one thousand dollars
per month ya
[eh] #rilek# [ah] #rilek# [ah] <malay>dengar dulu</malay> but but the thing is the time (err) I'm from
so <malay>bila kita</malay> (um) want to sign up for <malay>apa tu</malay> for internship you need to go through this website [ah] I forgot what's the website [oh] my <malay>apa</malay> website <malay>dia</malay> [ah]
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] website <malay>tu ada ada</malay> [lah] <malay>masih situ</malay> [ah]
so I went I went there then I went to search the thing is right I filter my search according to <malay>gaji</malay> so the highest paying one I highlight it first I I
I filtered it according to whether I I want to do the job then after I filter then there was like I think fifteen over [ah] fifteen over jobs okay then I filtered through <malay>gaji</malay> like which one is higher pay [lah]
so we can only select up to three so that time I picked three jobs one is
paying me one point eight one is paying me one point five and the last one was only paying me one point two so
I applied I forgot this job pays me which one because by the time I accept it I went to check back they take down the info like how much they pay whatsoever it's just the address [lah] the address of the company then after that then I was like okay [lah] at least I know I'm getting paid
at least one point two [lah]
then I went in then I went in #rilek-rilek# talk with my colleagues then got other interns <malay>juga situ</malay> they are leaving already
then I was like [eh] your <malay>gaji berapa</malay> [ah] how much <malay>kau dapat</malay> every month one thousand !huh! [eh] one thousand <malay>sikitnya</malay>
!wah! <malay>sikitnya</malay> one thousand then they look at me like how much you are getting paid then I like [oh] according to the website they say I'm getting paid like I don't know [lah] but
the same exact thing that I'm telling you I I told them so it's like I think at least one point two [lah] [eh] cannot be [what] no there's no there was it's just allowance
then comes my paycheck I went to see one thousand then I like <malay>apa hal ni</malay>
then after that then then the thing is I went to the boss I went to the boss then after lunch I went to the boss
the thing is my company is just a small company is a so there's only like ten to twelve of us working
so I went up to the boss after lunch and [eh] boss (uh) can ask you something [ah] yes yes what you want to ask I just want to ask [ah] the the allowance
is one thousand [ah] because I went to check the internet they say like if I'm not wrong is like one point two or one point five ya we only pay one thousand [ah]
I think this type of thing you need to check with the school then I'm like
<malay>malas</malay> you know typical malay right
like you know typical malay [ah] once you know you need to go the extra mile it's okay [lah] <malay>rezeki di mana-mana</malay>
no you will say can <malay>boleh macam mana</malay> [oh] you need to sign up this you need to do that [ah] <malay>tak apa</malay>
I give it to you
typical malay [ah]
!aduh!
<malay>kau nak doa lapan minit kau pergi doa</malay>
actually I so
just asking [ah] I I I haven't actually really go and see so they are linguists
plus computer science ya
we just keep it simple [lah] keep it simple
#mat-mat# #mat-mat# [ah]
nothing [lah] it's nothing nothing much
[ah] so little bit [lah] just just to cover up that that last seven minutes now I guess six minute yes
so go apply school [lah] [ah] [oh] ya talking about
Grab [lah] last time you were talking about Grab because ya no because I was like trying to go see <malay>macam dia punya</malay> timeline [ah] like what do you
said so we are going back one hour ago
so
<malay>kau cakap kau nak kerja</malay> Grab I mean as a
Deliveroo [oh] <malay>betul</malay> [eh] <malay>jauh</malay>
because I I myself also got (um) work as Foodpanda delivery so the thing is [ah] the pay to me is I tell you [lah] it's quite it's quite [ah] quite decent for I would say (err) part time [lah] because
okay I'm I do deliveries quite slow like to take my time so usually in one hour I can get like two to three deliveries done so for motorbike usually get paid about seven dollars to eight dollars depending on what type of orders you get [lah] so
let's say you get three orders so it's like twenty one dollars per hour so twenty one dollars per hour then after that then let's say you just only work four hours for that particular day you already got like eighty dollars so it's quite decent ya if
if you if you hustle even more <malay>macam</malay> hustle <malay>demi</malay> hustle [jer] is like that then usually you can get like four four orders
so it's it's quite possible to get like hundred dollars per day but that [one] is motor [lah] but ya [lah] but motor if I'm not wrong motor is being paid like seven to eight but bicycle you are getting paid from like five to six
ya so honestly speaking I guess is a good place to start if
if you really can't get anything because <malay>apa tu</malay> okay [lah] I got learn some finance also [lah] [kan] you should know [lah] so is is quite is quite a need to actually like have some kind of
ways for you to get money in [lah] rather than just <malay>duit terkeluar duit terkeluar</malay> then also I know that you have been out of job for quite some time
then it's not that you don't want to find job it's just the <malay>rezeki belum masuk lagi</malay> in terms of your full time whatsoever so I
if I'm if I'm you then start off with delivering <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] then while delivering then you can because when you do part time
if you have an interview for a full time you can technically like I don't want to work for the day I don't want to work for two days I want to get ready for my interview
you it's possible for you to do that and still there's some kind of income coming in for you let's say you only get like what fifty dollars per day it's still money like in one in one in one week you can get like what two hundred fifty dollars
one thousand my internship ya yes
let's say you you take it at most like you do two orders per per hour
so in order for you to get like fifty then you just need to deliver ten orders [ah] per day which is like only five hours per day you just like
take off like okay [ah] <malay>pukul sebelas sebelas sampai pukul empat</malay> [ah] I want to do delivery I got nothing much to do so it's it's quite a good
a good place for you to like start [lah] then some more because you most likely will be cycling and then you can build up your fitness
from your house <malay>sini jalan kaki</malay> #punggol# #sengkang# further [eh] macritchie further

ya because they <malay>tengok</malay> a lot of TikTok and then like there's this gamer she played with a group of friends so funny I like I want to try <malay>nak cuba</malay>
[oh] yeah yeah
[oh] yeah that's right
[ah]
[oh] my god it's like okay so I watched his TikTok of the like they play Among Us right he's so funny this intruder you know what's David he he swipe the knife right then after that got someone coming into the area that he killed a person then you know what he did he just press press press <malay>dia punya butang</malay> after that he hide the body behind him
then the guy just continue walking
yeah like cause I was like that's genius
I mean if
yeah they said if the other person actually went up to him confirm get caught already then I was like !wah! very lucky
[oh]
(uh) yeah yeah
(oo)
I think it's more interesting than Mafia game [lor]
(uh)
[oh] yeah that's (err)
(mm) <malay>betul</malay> !wah! I miss playing night games with people
yeah
yeah that's why they say what ruins friendships small UNO <malay>atau</malay> Among Us then I'm like
it's always so funny
yeah
(ugh) same
nope
<malay>bukan tak boleh tak suka ada beza</malay>
(err) all meat but I can still eat <malay>daging lembu</malay> yes
yeah because <malay>daging lembu selalu macam</malay> they have this smell
yeah yeah and then <malay>tak boleh tahan</malay> it's really bad for me especially like when my parents cook right then I always make a big fuss right I hate the smell
(mm)
I mean <malay>tak boleh</malay> predict [pe] so
then he will be like what !huh! who are you
yeah especially since (err) <malay>nanti</malay> the fish will <malay>macam bau ja hanyir</malay> so people don't like fish when they're pregnant usually also yeah
I mean (err)
I mean (err) I mean if you want to eat fish when you're pregnant is more unlikely
[oh] my gosh
(uh) yeah yeah
(oo)
[eh]
<malay>nak</malay> but then
<malay>bila nak pergi</malay> what's the plan
(oo)
twenty eight <malay>agak</malay> near [lah] <malay>kena</malay> check again
(mm) okay
okay yeah my poly friends also <malay>dia orang selalu nak jumpa habis tu macam tak ada benda lain nak buat ke</malay> they all already start uni
<malay>tak sekolah lain-lain</malay> [seh]
(err) I think different different courses (hmm)
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>dia orang nak jumpa makan</malay> [lah] <malay>nak jumpa belajar then I'm like <malay>kau semua belajar benda lain-lain abeh nak belajar sama-sama</malay>
yeah then <malay>macam</malay> guys move on
that's why then I <malay>macam</malay> !aiya! whatever [lah] it's up to them then next week [ah] <malay>minggu depan ada orang nak jumpa</malay> then they were like [oh] <malay>kita tunggu untuk</malay> Carea to like give when she free to meet then I'm like
yeah then [eh] I just open the chat <malay>habis tu</malay> I [kan] I just say (mm) (err) you guys go ahead I'm not free
I mean yeah but like I don't have
yes
yeah
then the <malay>makanan</malay> they all want to eat also <malay>selalu dia orang nak minta makanan</malay> I <malay>tak boleh makan</malay>
then I go they change the plan then I feel bad [what] then it's like (uh) just go ahead [lah] without me
yeah
(um) yeah then but it's like I don't know if I mean your group of circle then you naturally gravitate to food that I cannot eat I think that is very alarming to me
yeah cause <malay>dengan</malay> our secondary school friends <malay>kita tak ada macam masalah macam gitu</malay> [pe] <malay>selalu</malay> it's very easy for us to settle food [what]
yeah then is don't know [lah] is that time like I think after school we all wanted to hang out then they were like [oh] let's eat Umisushi then okay <malay>aku tak boleh makan</malay>
then they were like never mind [lah] you just sit here first then after that we go somewhere else that you can eat then I like
yeah it's like [oh] let's go out and eat together but then in the end you never show something that we can eat together right <malay>habis tu buat apa nak kata kita makan sama-sama</malay>
(mm)
that's why (ugh)
same is like they
yeah I understand it's it's like when you meet <malay>dengan dia orang</malay> it's supposed to be enjoyable but when you meet them then at the end of the thing you're just like <malay>penat</malay> [seh] why did I go out I regret going out of the house
[oh] my god yeah
exactly [oh] my god (ugh)
but how [seh] that time I topped up twenty dollar then I think I only went out like four or five times only then finishing then I'm like !huh!
(err)
yeah
that's like
(mm)
(mm)
I think so like that like that's what I remember
I mean
<malay>boleh</malay> experiment then you see <malay>mana satu lagi murah</malay>
then it depends on your station also [lah]
(mm)
(uh) yeah #aigoo# [dah] [lah] <malay>tak ada kerja habis tu</malay> bus fare <malay>pun mahal</malay> !hais!
[oh] I was so confused by it I I didn't do the survey <malay>dia punya</malay> yeah
I think it's a very how to say [ah] first world problem I feel
(mmhmm)
right yeah
(mm) yeah
that's true
I
yeah I mean it's very different perspective of problems [lah] like for us our problem is that we cannot get on the bus but for other people it's a different kind of problem like before we had the wheelchair accessible <malay>punya</malay> bus how do wheelchair people like get on the bus
exactly then that's why I think it's considered a million dollar like idea I guess to have those wheelchair friendly buses
then I'm (mm)
no no you can
cause even for like <malay>macam orang yang tak boleh nampak</malay> like visual disability they have new apps <malay>macam</malay> the what's that they say like you can take a photo or something with the handicapped phone then they help you read out the text or something like that
which is
yeah
(mmhmm)
yeah
(mm) that's true
that's why it's like if they didn't have a guide dog how do you tell if they are someone with disability
(mm)
cause even for my school cause #Ngee An# [kan] <malay>ada</malay> that dialogue in the dark so we have the what's the term called the sight disability <malay>pun</malay> I there was this period of time I had like <malay>macam</malay> class right then every time if I reach school <malay>dekat</malay> this certain timing I will see that <malay>makcik</malay> that cannot see then I will help her but she will need help to cross the bridge
yeah it's not like they cannot survive without help it's more of like
yeah
yeah it's sad [lah] because they if you were to compare our levels of convenience with them is very different
(mm)
yeah but I know their other senses will be heightened [lah] like if you cannot see maybe your hearing and your smell are stronger but it's not easy
yeah so I was like (hmm) I wish I was smart
yeah
yeah
forest fighting
oh forest no <malay>tak dengar</malay> [eh]
<malay>bagus</malay>
!wah! was the forest fire <malay>macam</malay> bad
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
[oh] my gosh
[oh] my gosh why <malay>apa gunanya</malay> gender reveal seriously
yeah
it's like why why must have fire
there's no other word for it
(mm)
[oh] my god can you imagine me
my parents thought I was a boy then when they give birth it was a girl yeah they really thought I was going to be in a boy it was so funny
like
[oh] that one I never ask so yeah
okay maybe I should ask is !wah!
it's !wah! ya
so funny
it's like
it's like a sike [eh] like [oh] it's a boy [oh] no it's a girl sike
I think gender reveal parties are very I don't know it's so over the top
it's over the top yeah
it's <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>pakai banyak sangat duit habis tu tak</malay> it doesn't add any meaning to anyone's life honestly it's just
yeah it's
I guess maybe we have different values like <malay>untuk kita</malay> if you have a child is more of like between yeah it's a blessing it's between your family you and your husband
I don't need to tell my friend who's a friend of this friend that I have a baby who's a boy and it might not be even accurate so
yeah I'm like (um)
[ah] yeah
(mm)
yeah yeah
(mm)
(mm)
eighty
is that like your commission or like your pay
[ah] yeah yeah
(err)
I mean you can't do anything if no one comes in
(uh) yeah
(mmhmm)
(uh)
[oh] my gosh
then
then then it's like should I be sad that there's no customers or should I be glad that there's no customers
(mm)
very easy money
(hmm)
I mean that's considered one of a good like working days I guess
(uh) yeah
that's true
[oh]
[oh]
!oof!
(uh)
!wah! [ah] speaking of Kelly and her mum the cake that she (mm) baked <malay>untuk</malay> your birthday !wah! I still think of it sometimes
right I'm still amazed that she did it [eh]
you are the one who made it
like
(uh)
I mean
(mm) understand
[ah]
(mmhmm)
yeah yeah yeah
yeah cause I mean I think the cake <malay>macam</malay> dry because [dah] <malay>simpan satu hari</malay> [pe] [dah] <malay>potong</malay> then you give it to them the next day but !wah! the whipped cream I was so amazed cause <malay>selalu</malay> whipped cream [kan] <malay>diorang buat</malay> cake is either <malay>macam banyak sangat</malay> then too sweet or like the whipping cream <malay>macam</malay> how to say ya <malay>macam berminyak</malay> is that the word like
yeah then is like you're like (uh) what is this [ah] then you scrape the frosting off
yeah
yeah that's true
that's why when we were bringing the cake in it's like !wah! Kelly the cake is so pretty
yeah
yeah don't cause you messaged me <malay>habis tu</malay> you messaged <malay>dengan orang lain</malay> [kan] and we were like (err) <malay>dia tak</malay> [kan] <malay>beli</malay> cake [kan] like (err) (err) (err)
that's why when you asked me <malay>kalau nak</malay> cake then I like I like cake but <malay>kalau aku bilang aku nak</malay> cake <malay>nanti kau beli macam mana</malay>
(uh)
yeah
no she panic cause <malay>yang</malay> when you were working together <malay>yang ada satu hari ni</malay> then after that <malay>kita</malay> send message then you <malay>pakai dia punya</malay> handphone [kan] then <malay>dia</malay> [eh] guys #Nisha# <malay>pakai aku punya</malay> handphone then we were like [oh] did she see the chat
yeah when you guys were working
!aiya! [lah] but it was just you know in case
then
yeah then we <malay>ni</malay> we panic right then <malay>kita tukar dia punya</malay> group name it was supposed to be like what about thirty first then we changed to orientation twenty twenty
right
yeah right I felt smart
that's why
and then I was like (err) what's Kelly's (um) faculty
and that's how we were discussing what to get for you
yeah
you know the round card right okay sorry side track but you know released (err) !wah! you know this whole week I think everyday right I think four days in a week right it released new merchandise then that one I don't care never mind
then they released like (err) new like product live for their documentary like their staycation documentary then the
yeah [eh] I can <malay>pinjam</malay> you my account to watch
cause yeah cause this one <malay>kena bayar</malay>
it's it's super hilarious macam you you <malay>boleh nampak</malay> their innocence as normal people and not like it's so funny
(err) sekarang [dah] <malay>ada empat</malay> if you want to include macam behind the scenes <malay>ada lapan</malay> in total
ya it's the weverse the the the the new fan cafe that one
yeah yeah it's so funny [ah] (ugh)
no no I was talking about the merchandise yeah right the <malay>cawan</malay> was okay this time round the merchandise quite cute yeah they got <malay>cawan</malay> I was like
is is like your cup <malay>nya</malay> design is like rounded at the bottom and then the colour is green
in the SOOP
merchandise you can just Google
yeah I think they're trying to bring in money [lah]
a lot you know they are re-releasing the you know Skool Luv Affair album the repackaged version
right I was like [oh] okay no no no no no I don't need
don't tell me I don't have the money to do that this month
right it's (ugh) and it's not very like <malay>macam</malay> merchandise is you
yeah
yeah that's why
!wah! you know the only time <malay>yang diorang letak diorang punya muka</malay> right the I think is the merchandise I was like <malay>nampak macam dua ribu tiga belas</malay>
I mean if you have the self-confidence and the self-esteem to wear it out go ahead girl or guy or whatever
(mm)
yeah they picked a very pretty shade of green then I was like genius
(mm)
!wah! yeah
twenty one is like the success is you can't even compare [leh]
it's
even people who are not their fans right see it and like [oh] is cute buys
[oh] I didn't know that okay
(mm) I see so many Youtube videos of people like they are not fans but their room is covered in <malay>punya bantal</malay [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> soft toy then I like
yes and it fits the aesthetic
(mm)
[oh] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the the #chibi# the tiny #Tan# [oh] my god [oh] I wanted to get their things and then after that <malay>aku nampak dia punya harga dengan dia punya</malay> shipping fee then I'm like
<malay>sudah</malay>
(ugh)
(ugh) don't even get me started on shipping (ugh)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
!oof!
<malay>dia punya</malay> shipping <malay>macam boleh beli tiga dia punya</malay> product [tau] I was like (ugh)
(mm)
that's why (ugh)
if
yeah that's why when I renew my membership right the membership kit is like twenty then after that I checked out right <malay>dia punya</malay> shipping the whole price went up to seventy then I like
yeah [lah] what's the point if I never buy the membership kit if I signed up
so I was like the thing I do for you guys
(mm)
what thing
[oh] no no no that one change already cause that one is <malay>diorang punya</malay> old style
you want to level up <malay>untuk dapat lebih banyak benda</malay> you must do the quiz and fill up the test
<malay>tak dia</malay> this one is more like accessible I guess but it's also scary cause people who are not their fans can easily buy and get in
<malay>tapi bodoh</malay> [lah] just <malay>tak</malay> you spend like <malay>ape</malay> thirty dollars just to <malay>kacau orang</malay> on the website
that's why it's like you the thirty dollar you don't want to use for other things
right !wah! the thirty dollar I think I can buy my whole new outfit that I've been looking at [leh]
well <malay>nak beli</malay> this <malay>macam</malay> sweater it's a knitted sweater [lah] then I also looking at this skirt
yeah Shopee [lah] what where else can I buy I am not that rich
yeah (err) I think the skirt <malay>dalam dua belas</malay> dollar <malay>gitu</malay>
yea yeah
yeah then the
<malay>tak</malay> it's just I want to save up the money first
(uh) yeah
because the shipping is only <malay>macam dalam dua tiga</malay> dollar <malay>gitu aje</malay> not much
yeah
!aiya!
okay can I will share to you
that's why and I feel bad for using fast fashion but is what I can afford so yeah
yeah cause <malay>macam</malay> it's not really like ethical I don't think is ethical like sourcing it's probably like those cheap cheap warehouse <malay>punya</malay> factory [lah] so yeah
(mm)
yeah
yeah
yeah
(mm)
yeah
okay
(err) I think
<malay>dah boleh</malay> off

okay so there other day right I was recently I've been watching a lot of
the VTuber [oh] my goodness I'm going to like combust you know like because normally sometimes they have like the mic right like the really good quality one so this guy he bought the I think it's called a binaural mic the for the basically you can hear like left and right right
[oh] my goodness then he was like (uh) then he was like whispering inside the ear and then I was listening it listening to it before I went to sleep and then I was like falling asleep already then after that he shifted the mic
he put it he put it to his chest so you can like hear his heartbeat very clearly and then after that he started whispering and this is damn cringe but I thought to myself !wah! is this what it's like to lie down on someone's chest while they're sleeping [oh] my god that's the dream it's so good then he revealed
he spent about
he said he spent I think twelve K on the mic
then after that when he said that he spent twelve K on the mic everybody started sending him money
like I just want to be a VTuber so people can send me money like they were pulling
this other guy he was pulling (uh) #gacha# for the Apex game
and then the moment he sent it someone sent him like two hundred dollars
and I'm like
dude
like I want to earn #gacha# so I can just earn back everything and pull more #gacha#
then another one they
he what [ah] he cause he didn't turn on super chats for his streams like ever since he debuted I think but then he decided to turn them on for this one stream and I think he earned about one point seven million yen
like in that one stream because <malay>kirakan</malay> everyone <malay>dapat lepas geram</malay> [ah] that kind of thing so finally can get to give him money and people will send him like five hundred dollars at the time I was like damn these people got money I also want [sia] I haven't sent my first super chat but I want to send to someone I'm planning to do it when someone is doing then I can be like thank you for your service thank you very much
that's the dream job though
super chat is the
is the way to send money through if on a youtube live stream so like you can send different amounts so there's like five dollars ten dollars it's up to maybe like five hundred dollars I think
and then you can send a message and the more the higher the super chat amount the longer your message is pinned on like the comment board so they can read it that kind of thing
it's like it's damn cool but then
is the
this girl also she she debuted like I think a month back her avatar is very cute she's like a shark girl she's super cute with the tail and all that she debuted like less than two months ago then she already hit like a million subscribers everyone was just throwing money at her it's insane dude and these people never even don't even need to show their face they just sit there act cute on camera play game <malay>tu</malay> [jer] easy game <malay>dapat duit</malay>
it's just that's the dream job jobs I don't want to work
I really don't want to work
it's insane
all they have to do is sit there and be pretty
ya then like
it's like but I guess especially for streamers right from what I see I guess it's not that easy especially because of like the drama that I told you about just now
I and the fact that they have to stream every day I guess it's hard to differentiate yourself in such a saturated market [lah] that's the thing
there's one guy who streams at least two hours everyday he's the one who spent like one point five K on #gacha# the other day just because he really liked the voice actor
then he spent I think he spent another
a few hundred dollars [lah] at least the other day to get the cute girl the one that I showed you yesterday with the really cute running cycle
so everybody was like okay just wait until the next character banner comes up which I think will be #zhong li# that's why <malay>tu aku pun nak</malay> [sia] he's so hot I cannot I really cannot
he's so hot like
(um) what [ah]
(uh) I was gonna say something but I forgot
(uh) [oh] then yesterday I was watching another one of his streams it was it was the funniest like games stream that I've ever watched because so there's this girl her name is #chihiro yuki# but basically she's her main character is like (uh) this magic girl and then but sometimes she she uses like a deeper voice <malay>kirakan macam jadi lelaki</malay> [lah] that kind of thing so (uh) then she was streaming Apex with that voice and then suddenly these two guys two of her friends join in then they like want to play along then <malay>dorang pun buat suara merepek gitu</malay> then they were like [oh] I want to do this then they were like shit they were saying it in the in the like manly voice and then suddenly they go back [oh] I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that it's damn funny but if they stream didn't last for that long long [lah] but
it was damn cute I want to see them play together they they're competing I think they were training for like this thing called the cup so basically it's like (uh) an Apex Legends tournament
these help it's organised by like this other VTuber this other streamer who's like really good at Apex so there are a lot of people from like VTubers or just pro gamers in general they can join the cup and then I think this time round they actually got prize money they like fifty thousand yen or something like that
it's quite a lot
fifty thousand fifty thousand I think
no (uh) fifty thousand yen in is
okay [lah] six hundred fifty dollars I thought it would be more but this I think this the first time that they are having
prize money [lah] but it's quite interesting to watch
it's
the the last one was quite interesting because
there's this VTuber whose avatar is literally just a gorilla he's just cause his his username is just V gorilla virtual gorilla which is quite interesting like you actually like when you listen to his voice and then you look at the avatar it's like !huh! that makes sense it's not surprising but he's like really good at Apex a lot of these people are like the top five hundred
I cannot [sia] is so scary
I I thought you meant in real life as in like he tried he like hit you with your or something like that
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>faham</malay> that situation that was me when I was playing when I started playing #zelda# I was like so <malay>kecoh</malay> you know I'm like <malay>aku macam budak bodoh</malay> [sia] <malay>aku aku nak nak simpan dia nya apa tu</malay> I wanted to like stop I would accidentally press the arrow button like to to aim the bow and arrow then after that <malay>bila aku nak aku nak</malay> cancel [kan] <malay>aku lupa nak</malay> cancel then instead I press the left side <malay>dia nya</malay> down button and then that's how you activate the whistle right then after that instead I start attracting all the monsters in the middle of the night <malay>macam budak bodoh</malay> [sia] I died so many times while playing that
hand eye coordination skills for games is good because I I started playing games when I was pretty young cause you know my brother right
<malay>lagipun</malay> you <malay>main</malay> you like now you play is it PUBG or is it COD
my I know my class ratio was also quite whack we only had like
I think that ratio was similar to yours we only had ten guys eleven guys I think it's common for schools of like anderson and yes that level then the
I never really started playing games a lot until I got until I got the Switch actually
because before that okay [lah] my parents raised me to be a bit of a nerd [lah] I mean I'm not surprised I mean look at them right this guy reads
the theory of relativity for fun like this guy then I remembered the one thing I used to play a lot I had the Wii Fit then <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>duduk itu dengan apa tu dia nya itu</malay> like the the white <malay>punya</malay> platform <malay>itu</malay> then I look at the thing then I'm like [eh] <malay>aku berat</malay> [ah] [sia] then after that I was like okay whatever moving on but that was quite fun then but I did have the
what's it called
that was damn good though it's like now you think about it right the was basically a Switch
that's why it's like the was so ahead of its time I love playing with the I don't know mine was pink and I only had like one game on there and it was Taken
the is like quite similar it's basically like your Switch Lite right
it's basically the same then what [ah]
(uh) shit what's that other game called Mortal Kombat is it the one with the this like this blue ice guy who's like do you know who
I like that guy I used to have this phase where I just really like watching their like what is it called their finishing moves that [one] !wah! that [one] is quite cool I really like the whole concept of like coming up with each characters like
like finishing moves or like their character design that's what I really like watching looking at when I play games
(uh) I don't know [ah] I don't remember her name but I went to her house cause my <malay>mak nak pergi masjid</malay> so she had to drop me off there [ah] then she was then [oh] my cousin like she was playing Mortal Kombat on the then you know at the ripe at the really young age of four then like she was playing it and I saw it and I saw someone's spine get ripped out of their body and then (um) ya it kinda traumatised me I couldn't sleep that night cause I was always looking at the door I was scared that someone would come in and then rip my spine out ya so that's
I I remember watching I remember watching one of those the ones where like they just yank your intestines out
but
I I have to admit I really like the character design even regarding final fantasy right there's that one guy I think his name is cloud is he from final fantasy
I like I like playing him on Smash because [eh] he quite handsome and his power quite cool
[ah] I want to get good at Smash though
I really want to get good at Smash but it's so difficult like I was watching okay not to bringing the conversation back to VTubers but like they often sometimes the livers like to play with their audience right so they put like the room password and all that on the screen then one there's one notorious guy known as he's not a streamer he's a a viewer also this one guy whose username is pornhub then he always plays as donkey #kong# and he has never failed to turn up with every single [eh] this company [lah] this company at least every single livers livestream if they are playing smash with the viewers and he always beats the shit out of that liver [ah] I don't think I think to this day
nobody has ever beaten pornhub donkey #kong# in in smash if they play with viewers that's the someone has gotten very close it's the guy who spent on point five K on #gacha# he's he got very close to beating him but I think in the end the donkey #kong's# the one that's quite that's like a interesting piece of lore from youtubers but that's quite cool
like I would like to have the title [oh] I beat this VTuber in Smash once I want to play Tetris but they never play Tetris anymore like they used to they used to play Tetris a lot but now now that I'm good at Tetris nobody plays it anymore I cannot flex my skills
it's my one secret talent Tetris but haven't played in quiet a while though
it's quite long right
[oh] serious [ah] <malay>dia orang belum</malay> like you <malay>beli kat mana</malay> Shopee
I think you try <malay>dahulu kalau dia orang tak</malay> reply <malay>baru</malay> send email
serious <malay>masih belum</malay>
it's <malay>kat</malay> Carousell or what
[ah] (uh) did they give you like a batch number or something like that
then maybe you should ask them about that [lah]
it's it's been that's really long it's not a signed on right
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya I remember now I remember now
I haven't bought an album in so long
BTOB !huh! BTOB can they okay to be fair I guess half of the band half of the band is still in the army but the first thing I think I showed you right the first thing like #changsub# and #eunkwang# just got like (uh) they just got released right recently then the first thing they do is go act stupid or some national television show where some matching gold and silver outfit with the X on <malay>bodoh</malay> it's like if I don't know if you know but they did something similar like a long time ago
<malay>dia orang pakai macam apa tu yang</malay>
it's it's like those body tight suits then #changsub# <malay>pakai yang</malay> gold then #eunkwang# <malay>pakai</malay> yang silver or some or it was the other way around it was like skin tight you know it's the kind <malay>cuma muka dia orang</malay> [jer] <malay>boleh nampak</malay> and then they go on national television you know and then they go sing some stupid trot song then they come out of the army okay [lah] admittedly now is a bit more classy <malay>dia orang pakai macam</malay> like black they like the black business pants black business shirt that kind but doesn't take away from the fact that they are doing something so <malay>bodoh</malay> but okay [lah] I miss them I'm glad they're back those two are probably my favourite members
but I heard that one thing that was quite scary before #changsub# enlisted was I heard that
something
he has something to do with his vocal chords like it was like
either getting quite damaged or basically it it was like threatening his the ability to sing [ah] so that was quite okay I can't remember the details but ya that was quite scary they said
he was straining it too much or something like that
so now I'm but I'm so I'm glad that in wait in the army got to rest I'm glad that he he and key got to enlist together that [one] was damn funny the video with the band members <malay>dia orang tengah buat hal kat belakang tu</malay> [kan] <malay>tu merepek</malay> [sia] but at least at least it's good to see that they're having fun in this
<malay>tapi dia orang punya army macam best</malay> [jer]
I know they often I don't know if it's an army thing or what but they have like musicals inside the army is it
right
like the concert I remember #eunkwang# was inside [one] like <malay>dia orang masuk</malay> army <malay>buat</malay> <malay>ke [pe] ke dia orang tengah buat</malay> some musical school or what [sia] I don't get it <malay>dia orang ada</malay> military band [lah] <malay>buat</malay> performance <malay>sini</malay> performance <malay>sana dia orang buat</malay> parade <malay>abeh tu kita kat singapura dia orang macam nak mati</malay> [sia]
you
like
discharged
!huh! serious
I feel like april some should have gotten though I was talking to my secondary school friend the other day then then his was he had to enlist in april <malay>tapi dia dah dapat</malay>
I'm <malay>aku aku pun tak tahu</malay> [sia] I have one friend who cause <malay>dorang ada</malay> I cannot I don't
#alhamdulillah# I don't know if it's the right
term but
he got an offer to join like <malay>dia orangnya</malay> commando training or something like that it's like <malay>macam</malay>
I feel like elite is too is too strong of a word but <malay>macam lebih dia orangnya</malay> fitness level is a bit higher than the rest
then
I was like how do they even figure that out
you know you know what I mean your NAPFA is one thing [lah] but
<malay>seram</malay> [sia] then he then they said that [oh] they will learn
like the more intense stuff like
like diving I don't know I don't know to be honest but it was quite scary but I think he rejected it in the end because it was like nah bro I don't want to become a slave to the army
[oh]
[oh] serious
(mmhmm)
I can I I remember but I cannot remember #ashraf#
I think infantry is like the main
<malay>kirakan</malay> body of the army isn't it or is that weapons infantry
the only knowledge I have about singaporean national service is [ah] boys to men that's it that's the only that's the only thing that I know
but that was the whole thing like singapore is
one of the is it I don't know if there are more countries in the world that make it that make conscription is that the word
they're like
okay anyway the the the fact that they have to go to army enlist
if it's I wonder if they're more countries that make it
the law that they have to or more countries that don't it's probably more countries that don't right I only know korea is necessary singapore necessary
I don't know what malaysia is it necessary
<malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [kan]
[ah] I remember I remember the whole fiasco everybody was like [oh] my god what happens if they need to enlist like guys chill it's their it's the law they need this is bigger than you guys #weh# <malay>tapi seram</malay> [seh] the fact that they have to draw lots I feel like that's scarier I rather just everyone enlist like that
there has to be a better way to do it rather than drawing lots it really felt like [oh] <malay>dia orang dah tak boleh kesah korang nak macam mana nak buat macam ini</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> [pe] [lah] aku tak kesah</malay> [ah] pick lots [jer] [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> [jer]
<malay>gitu</malay> [jer] really that's the <malay>gitu</malay> [jer] the effort
but it's <malay>seram</malay> [sia]
I know I think it was
was it japan they said
that they don't have like their army in the army they don't it's not like they train physical they train physically [lah] but they do a lot of other shit like
what meditate or stuff like that it's like it's basic army is basically like therapy for them it's interesting but like what happens
like
I wonder what would turn out better you know people who are forced to be inside there or people who like
they and you enlist but then again your training is not necessarily
as bad you know
it's so scary to think about though
kamikaze
ya that's the one they like stab themselves in the stomach right or slit open their stomach like that
lose
but then again I guess death
being a prisoner of war
not very two bright sides you know it seems like a lose lose situation here so
probably not
screws over your whole body
!huh!
heartbreak
[oh]
I don't like watching war movies just because I really cannot like you know you know me right I cannot watch anything with too much emotion I'm a very mellow person the most
intense war like thing I probably watched was the
(uh) what's the one that the Ghibli [one]
[ah] <malay>itu itu itu itu itu</malay> that was probably the most war like thing I've watched but
and it's <malay>budak kecil lagi</malay>
the part when <malay>dia apa itu dia kasi batu</malay> [eh] <malay>batu</malay> then <malay>dia ingat</malay> it's <malay>gula</malay> or something like that
I cannot that part was like that that that shit really hurt I really cannot
it's so scary to think that world war two
was not even that long ago
it's
it's not even not even hundred years not even a hundred years right
like that's so recent that's damn scary
my <malay>nenek</malay> was I remember she I cannot remember if she told me the story or my mum told me the story
<malay>dia kata bila</malay>
<malay>dia orang tengah</malay> I think they were like searching the houses or something like that then
<malay>dia nya mak bapa</malay> they put her and her siblings
<malay>kat dalam</malay>
<malay>apa itu</malay>
rice sack then <malay>letak kat dalam</malay> drain then two of them the siblings they put they hide the siblings inside the rice sack cause <malay>dia orang masih kecil</malay> [kan] then <malay>dia orang letak kat dalam</malay> drain <malay>dia orang</malay> cover then after that they ran away I don't know what happened after that I didn't really ask I kinda wanna know but I don't really want to ask cause
ya that shit they can't that can't be not traumatic right so I didn't really want to bring it up again but it was like
damn scary imagining imagine that you have to hide for your life like that
<malay>lagipun masih kecil</malay> [sia] it's
damn scary
serious [ah]
#bestnya#
<malay>dia orang naik sampan</malay> serious
that's that's that's terrifying that's real terrifying [oh] my god
when was that before the after war
#suay#
you'd be <malay>budak</malay> indonesia now !wow!
!wah! that's damn scary though wasn't there the controversy recently about like
how
[ah] okay I don't know if controversy is the right word but people were quite angry at how the japanese pretend like they never did anything bad ever
ya
#hiroshima#
karma
it's the one that resulted in <malay>yang dia orangnya</malay> nuclear meltdown [kan] is it
!wah! I remember watching a documentary about the what went down at the nuclear plant like they were
interviewing cause it's quite rural right so then they were interviewing the people who were living in that village
and then they were talking about how [oh] all are the kids were
they interviewed like the schoolchildren and all that
like the people who were still kids at that point and like the school teachers and all that then I think some of them even though they were like quite far from the thing
they
got exposed to like all the radiation and all that then a lot of them like they didn't not that they passed away instantly but they passed on like a few years after that then it was so scary the way they talked about it so like
you can feel that they are still like very scared of that area then they showed the village what it was like and like a lot of the they showed like the fruits and like the plants and all that it's
<malay>cacat</malay> isn't the right word because it looks very pretty but it seems like it's all deformed and like
correct correct it's like what you see in like sci-fi movies <malay>gitu</malay> <malay>seram</malay> #siot# I wonder if they rebuilt it
the nuclear plant
!huh!
wait that's both very scary and very sad at the same time cause I know they they believe quite strongly in what religion do they follow [ah]
it's not it's like a subset of buddhism is it
spin off
sorry I laughed just now because you know I sent the message to my parents to tell them to enter the house quietly
I misspelled house as horse and then my dad said there's a horse
<malay>merepek</malay> [sia] this guy
but I do but I guess that's the one thing about japan [ah] <malay>dia orang</malay> they're very secular
that's the thing right but like how to say
even if you're different at least they're nice about it that kind of thing I remember last time I went to
new zealand <malay>aku pakai hijab</malay> [kan] then <malay>bila kita masuk</malay> okay [lah] granted this was quite a long time ago
<malay>kita</malay> me and my mum my dad cause me and my mum <malay>dua-dua pakai tudung</malay> [kan] <malay>kita masuk</malay> cafe <malay>dia orang tengok kita macam kat</malay> zoo [sia] <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
like bro chill I'm ten like don't okay I wasn't ten but like like like don't need to stare so hard you know but then when <malay>bila kita kita pergi</malay> japan all that they were much more polite about it even if they didn't like it they didn't say it outright
irritating
it's just
like damn dude all the stares [what] you will literally like stare like nobody's business
[oh] speaking of the like tsunami and earthquake right wasn't there that one really big earthquake or tsunami in
indonesian #aceh# is it
I know it was really big but I don't
do you remember like any news about it I cannot okay given that we were one [lah]
that's true
belongings anymore you can't retrieve like old photo books so it's kind of like everything your whole life just got washed away like that ya and at that time I think a lot people at the beach also so ya [lah] it was quite #suay# that it happened and I don't think it just affected #aceh# it affected some parts of malaysia also ya ya then <malay>kat situ pun ada macam satu</malay> family <malay>dia orang pun dia orang tengah main-main kat</malay> beach then <malay>dia nya anak pergi lari</malay> near the coastline ya then
!huh! serious [ah]
<malay>seram</malay> [pe]
that's true ya the pros are pretty big considering that we have like protection from natural disasters singapore like singapore is a pretty safe country I would say like the fact that I can leave the house with the windows open and come back with everything still intact I think that's pretty impressive within itself like I saw the news <malay>dia orang</malay> [kan] like <malay>ada orang</malay> malaysia <malay>tinggal kat singapura</malay> since the borders <malay>dah tutup</malay> [kan]
then they said like
(uh) when they is the causeway open already
limited is it like <malay>orang</malay> like <malay>pekerja</malay> so like I think either they went back or the police found out or the neighbours <malay>ke</malay> [pe] he found and he had the house they had the house had been broken into then apparently the thieves the
ya the thieves they stayed in the house
right
right it's so gross [kan] like can you imagine you come you cannot go back to your own country because of COVID and after that when you go back all your stuff <malay>dah hilang</malay> then <malay>ada orang tidur kat dalam katil kau</malay> !ee! <malay>seram</malay> [sia] I cannot it's gross it's so gross
(ugh)
(ugh)
it's basically parasite
less gruesome sense
but the fact that they have to resort to that is quite sad as in like the homeless people in america the homeless crisis is so bad like I was watching
a documentary about it the other day
like there are so many
homeless people and because inevitably all these people like fall end up falling sick right and then (uh) for all the people apparently
for all the homeless people in like los angeles or that part of los angeles cause itself is <malay>besar gila</malay> [kan] there's only two doctors who are offering who will go around giving out free healthcare free check ups for these people like can you imagine the first the the fact that firstly there's so many homeless people is already like so telling of <malay>korangya</malay> government but then the fact that so many doctors like come on obviously there has to be a lot of doctors right in america the fact that only that <malay>cuma orang dua orang</malay> [jer] are willing to give out free treatment for these homeless people like they seriously what do you lose from it you know like where's your basic sense of humanity if you've got you've got the knowledge and skills <malay>korang</malay> just check up <malay>sikit pun boleh</malay> [pe] the fact that only two people regularly do it
it's so insane I cannot stand america <malay>dia orang nak</malay> vote <malay>pun buat hal</malay>
it's insane I cannot it's a gross country
I cannot [eh] my first amendment my right to own a gun like it's gross dude I almost swore I don't know if I'm allowed to swear but
it's gross [sia] then now also I just really hope really really really I pray to god <malay>ya allah</malay> please forgive me for all my sins just just make sure donald trump <malay>tak menang</malay> serious I if people if
people are still <malay>dia orang nak tulis apa tu</malay> cause you can write in to you can even if your candidate name is not there right you can write in the name of someone which is a bit <malay>bodoh</malay> [ah] honestly like what's the point a lot of people <malay>dia orang tulis nama</malay> kanye west [tau] because he was he's been joking about it no it to us he feels like he's joking but to him it's like he's it's real right he's been talking about [oh] vote me in for president president guys then I'm like
<malay>asal kau nak buat macam ini ya allah</malay> serious why it's so <malay>bodoh</malay> I cannot and the fact that
I don't know [lah] it's just okay [lah] granted they have a their population is what three times
five whatever [lah] it's huge right and like I get that elections are much more big
the one again one of the pros of living in singapore
okay apart from the super super what do you call it
super majority
if anything but at least now things are changing but I just hope they don't lower the voting age
countries like america
that's the thing you see like okay not okay I might sound a bit like a boomer like but
it's like I was a bit scared because <malay>jangan</malay> vote opposition for the sake of voting opposition like you <malay>kena tengok pandai-pandai</malay> [lah] look at the zone if it's versus what
reform party or something the the group that <malay>nampak macam</malay> gangster <malay>mat mat</malay> on the street <malay>macam mat</malay> biker <malay>ke</malay> [pe] <malay>macam</malay> at like
please [lah] if they
if they can't even give a proper speech if they can't even sound motivated on national television you think they can take care of your zone and all like <malay>pandai-pandai</malay> [ah] don't vote anyhow for the reform party [lah]
okay I cannot sorry reform party but did not specifically targeting you but it's just
okay how to say
like I get that it's good to have opposition but <malay>pandai-pandai</malay> [ah] don't
I have to admit though cause <malay>dahulu</malay> I <malay>tinggal kat</malay> #serangoon# [kan] I used to stay under worker's party area <malay>yang</malay> #hougang# #serangoon# #aljunied# <malay>itu</malay> I have to admit a lot of things were broken a lot of things weren't fixed properly that kind of thing but I guess you're right [lah] ya <malay>dia orangnya</malay> financial backing
but that's the part that I don't get <malay>kalau</malay> they're <malay>dia orang dah kat dalam</malay> government
<malay>abeh itu</malay> then they want to upgrade the resident's like area
then the money shouldn't it be equal
given regardless of your party since technically this is still
the the government see this is why you shouldn't let people our age vote we don't know about this kinda thing it doesn't it just doesn't work out
is that it's not #shahira# is it he's not suddenly right he agents near G got her she did she got her first as a back already she did really [lah] she most people said was reporting or A B for the people that she got there are only two people like the professor gift and a push by eight minus and she was so happy person as it was about I think it was about karl marx and just his communism until ya there's marks and then he's called though not really she had to like read the book or like some excerpt from the book and then she had read a whole essay advocate like two thousand words ya
[oh]
the essay was about what
just karl marx and just his communism
(ugh)
I can't believe she's in uni already that's insane
makes sense though
#bestnya#
I also want to go overseas study
(ugh) my heart pain yesterday
you have to bid it's like imagine but like on steroids
my heart pain I was I was more sad about the fact that we wouldn't get to go (uh) university exchange because look at #rifqi# he's still so close with his two friends like [eh] I also want to be friends with a cute japanese boy okay
I'm sure like and not gonna lie if both of us had applied I'm pretty sure both of us would have been shoot in students
like not gonna lie like I don't normally don't have that much confident in confidence in my abilities but like
(ugh) so sad I really cannot I'm I'm never gonna get over it <malay>aku</malay> serious <malay>nak pergi</malay> overseas
!wah!
that's why [sia] the moment we were like waiting for the news is the border going to be closed or not but then <malay>bila kata tutup</malay> then we were like [ah] shit
twenty twenty man one more and I can't believe it's almost november already november december [eh]
and this sem okay [lah] given that our assignments are quite hands-on all that we're moving so fast
it's only end of week one there's so much stuff to do already and I don't know what's going on I feel <malay>aku masih belum tengok</malay> election video <malay>takpe takpe</malay> whatever <malay>selama aku dapat</malay> mark attendance it's okay <malay>takde</malay> exam <malay>pun tak yah kesah</malay>
I cannot I really cannot
but did you know now that I think about it right at first I was like very sure that I wanted to do magazine but then now that we're actually during production production <malay>macam</malay>
(hmm) like not bad seems quite fun also but I guess we have to wait until we actually see what it's like <malay>bila</malay> the test [ah] I'm just scared
okay

!wow!
!siala!
young marriages [eh]
the first thing is the first thing in my mind is just divorce ya
!oof!
like that thing <malay>anak luar nikah</malay> [jer]
like child before marriage
no like okay maybe they got married at eighteen <malay>pasal ada anak</malay>
(mm)
foolish this tough man like
!wow! there's a lot of way way [sia] <malay>macam</malay>
okay !wow! wait I need to like plan this out like I need to do
okay young marriages [eh] okay I think
okay <malay>dalam segi agama</malay> I would say okay like really just wise like follow your religious maybe it's a good thing [lah] like just to settle down like (err) <malay>apa</malay> to prevent like any sins or any like (um) what does it call
no no (mm) <malay>haram</malay> and thing and like <malay>macam</malay> (um) (uh) what is it <malay>macam</malay> the bad like people won't talk bad about you what does that thing call
something like that ya is like you know (err) like people said you are so young like you know like obviously people judge right
but then is like you can ya we are married you know we are not dong anything wrong we are not ya they are not doing anything wrong what they are not doing anything wrong
so <malay>macam apa</malay> ya
divorce
!oof!
okay
okay
okay
okay
they want to get married like what by by by two years time in a year's time
but they
I think like getting married and having a family is two different things
ya so what are you what do you have in mind getting married or building up a family
honestly no [ah] because like <malay>nanti macam ingat kau macam main main</malay>
like you think what this [one] <malay>main main</malay> is it like you what your girlfriend you break up patch back patch back <malay>merepek</malay> [what]
ya so like I think okay maybe eighteen is a legal age but no I think that's like marriage like maybe that's too young but unless like how to say like [ah] I've heard [lah] stories <malay>macam aku nampak yang</malay> they got married at seventeen or sixteen ya <malay>islam</malay>
that's the thing I don't know is it in singapore or malaysia [ah] malaysia <malay>ku entah</malay> [leh] maybe it's normal maybe is not [lah] but like they say like you know then I see and the thing is the best part is that both parents like (err) what is <malay>restu</malay>
[ah] [ah] they give <malay>restu</malay> [ah] they give I the blessing [ah] <malay>dorang kasih</malay> blessing <malay>dorang</malay>
then it's like !wow! like that's I think that's takes a lot of courage [ah] for parents <malay>nak kasih restu</malay> like to cover him at the young age but then we don't know what the reason the actual reason behind [lah] [kan]
then
now the only thing I can think of when you say young marriage is like maybe they did something or maybe they just like <malay>tak sabar</malay>
they just want to like so <malay>macam</malay> like [oh]
if I get married [oh] you know everything will be like <malay>halal</malay> you know <malay>macam ni ni ni ni</malay> like actually [ah] he's the one or like you know what I don't know how to explain but like <malay>macam</malay>
at least like whatever you do right like people can't really like judge you that much because like you're not doing anything wrong ya you're not giving a bad image you're just young
you just look young
ya
ya
so if later <malay>macam</malay> if it's just reflects to the people and there's like [oh] <malay>kau tengah</malay> stereotype just because I'm young
and I I I have a children that means we're not married ya
<malay>apa</malay>
!oof! that is like
time [eh] I don't think
I don't know I don't
for me [ah] okay [ah] <malay>kalau kau tanya aku persendirian aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] because like I think I I really believe <malay>yang macam apa ya</malay> love does not <malay>apa ya</malay> time does not define love <malay>ke</malay> love does not define time <malay>ada kat</malay> that thing [ah]
like <malay>kalau kau jatuh cinta kalau kau like you and then you feel like he's the one he's the one [ah] because like I heard stories like my <malay>apa apanya cikgu</malay>
she was in a relationship ever since like in secondary school <malay>sampai ke tua</malay> like twenty six like that she was schooling my school like she was ready she was asking to marriage but then guy still wanted to play around
like <malay>macam</malay> he he wasn't serious he still don't want to get married
no no not not the other chicks [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> he's just not ready for marriage <malay>dia tak dia tak belum fikir</malay> [kan] [lah] okay for my <malay>cikgu</malay> [kan] she's like okay let's say <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] ya
okay the guy likes to <malay>lepak jam beberapa jam ke dua tiga pagi</malay> [tau] just <malay>lepak bawa blok berbual-bual rokok tu semua</malay> right my teacher is like by eleven is like [eh] <malay>aku tak penat jah</malay> like I want to go home I want to sleep like so like that ya so <malay>macam</malay> they they I think it's like eight years' relationship
ya ya they call it off they <malay>dia orang tak tunang pun</malay> ya they broke up she broke up with him and then after that (err) <malay>kak</malay> got to know
she again she started to you know go (err) around
find new people think she dated one I think like less than a year and I saw she <malay>tunang</malay> and then after that a year after that she got married ya ya
ya that's the thing like actually I was shocked that she she like she was okay [lah] maybe <malay>dia ada rasa sedih</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>siapa tak rasa sedih</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> break up
but she's like you know what this is not what I want like like she knows what she wants <malay>tu aku yang jawab aku</malay> respect <malay>kau</malay> [ah]
and the fact that she told me at I was what eighteen at that point I was eighteen at that point she was twenty six then I was like !wah!
but ya
and I think she just started like schooling like [eh] no not I mean working at that school like maybe about one year or two years around that ya around that
tie tie want to tie tie a knot

[ah] <malay>kau nak</malay> complain <malay>pasal</malay> [ah] <malay>apa apa apa</malay> (err) birth rate (uh) decreasing of birth rate because <malay>kau nak suruh aku kerja dua kerja</malay> [eh]

(mm)
yes yes
[oh] me sorry
typical [lor] Grab
why
why
I don't have a bike I don't have
ya exactly the only thing that were that [one] is just time [ah] <malay>minyak</malay> okay [lah] let's say we don't we don't use the the the car or the bike [ah] we use scooter
this scooter also like take up battery
so
<malay>tak ke</malay> minister <malay>gila nak sama kita kerja dua job</malay>
and the thing is you know okay like my
places
my places places <malay>apa</malay>
okay <malay>tempat kerja aku</malay>
(uh) <malay>apa</malay> they they have this form to let (uh) what does it call [ah] <malay>macam</malay> and need to sign [ah] let's say like [oh] to confirm that I'm not working another job you know that thing [ah] [ah] [ah] that [one]
then I'm like so what I cannot work another job ya
ya so how am I suppose to work
the second job ya I mean obviously <malay>saya nak saya boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> still !haiya! <malay>entahlah</malay> I really think it's a bit
bullshit for for them to want ask to work two jobs
ya
let's say <malay>kau kerja</malay> government government based job
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> second job <malay>tak akan</malay> [eh] you cannot you cannot have two government jobs also [what]
[ah]
like but our minister said can
the court minister say can
ya
if like that means right is like okay I'm working for full time and then my side business let's say
to do the bake bake (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
bake cookies [ah] let's say [ah] [ah] home based [ah]
(uh) <malay>apa</malay> ya so <malay>aku kerja</malay> full time <malay>abeh lepas tu</malay>
side business is bake cookies okay [what] is so do you consider that is a second job or is that just a like but then you said already said is really say side hustle
but also time and effort way to do that effort [sia] because you do that as a second job
so
so
what do is the good I don't see any good in working into two jobs more income I don't think so
I don't [eh] I don't really think that [sia] serious
more income because you <malay>kau penat</malay> [seh]
okay [ah] let's say you work five days a week okay you work office hours then you have second jobs maybe let's say a part time [ah] ya part time second job second job is a part time
then maybe you need to work four days a week
then you have to commit one weekend so so in a way actually you are working six days a week less time for your family also [sia]
I mean obviously no family no problem [ah] if you have a what
for you
because okay I ask you time or money
(mm) (mm) ya
<malay>bagi kamu pilih</malay> time or money <malay>aku pilih</malay> money <malay>pasal apa aku selalu</malay> broke
<malay>kau</malay>
no no no right now money
so they're chasing after money [what]
ya best choice but like you said forty fifty plus not lonely [ah]
[eh]
ya it's a very tough question [lah] that's like <malay>aku</malay> just like it sucks [ah] you gonna sacrifice [ah] <malay>kalau kau nak duit takde</malay> time <malay>kalau kau nak</malay> time <malay>kau takde duit</malay>
ya let's say only singapore [lah] because where else
where else [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
so <malay>kita penat</malay>
<malay>kalau nak</malay> link to suicidal thought suicidal rates also increase [what]
and the fact that singapore don't show the suicidal rates
(mmhmm)
where last time they think that [eh] <malay>apa</malay> you suicide you depressed only it's like [oh] you're just stress
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm) (mm)
[ah]
(mm)
ya I think because one thing <malay>sekarang</malay> internet accessible [what] so ya it's easy then that time (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
projects school project <malay>aku apa kena</malay> search for mental health [oh] my god
the more I read because okay the thing is it's just not depression there's anxiety there's (uh) what panic disorders there's these disorders [eh] <malay>banyak</malay> [sia] disorder
and like the more I read is like thing [kan] <malay>dorang macam</malay> cross
cross link <malay>macam</malay> cross link <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] it's like it's so like when I read like [eh] am I reading about anxiety or am I reading about another another disease because it's like so similar but it's actually different [oh] my god and like <malay>macam</malay> when I read it is like
I can't imagine someone going through it because to me it's like too much
behaviour
split personality
[ha] <malay>jijik</malay> the split

(err) I've heard about split personality only but I didn't know about you did (uh) you can have like multiple (uh) personality I didn't know about the multiple I only know about split disorder

when she was young then <malay>lepas tu</malay> when she grew up obviously <malay>dia macam</malay> loner <malay>bawa</malay> bloodshed rumah then <malay>lepas tu</malay> she I think she got suicidal thoughts [lah] she got self-harm so there were scars like
everywhere had her body her arms [ah] legs all that so when the beast saw it right then she say [oh] you're pure
but normal girls because she he kidnapped three girls K one of it pure than the other two <malay>mereka macam</malay> popular kind then is like [oh] <malay>kau tak</malay> pure
<malay>kau macam tak kisah gitu pasal orang</malay> something like that [ah]
no I thought of that too
but when they showed the scars of the girl who's like [oh] you're pure because in a way is like <malay>dia tahu rasa sakit kau tak tahu rasa sakit</malay> that's why <malay>aku rasa dia</malay> pure <malay>daripada kau</malay>
something like that [ah] this is what I interpret from the movie [ah]
something like that ya
it's very end it's actually a trilogy
the old movie is called (uh) shit I forget then the second [one] is split the third [one] is glass
glass they combine all the three [one]
[ah] the first [one] it was bruce willis

true

hi
my name is #Intan# and this is weird
okay I guess so it's gonna be the same thing maybe <malay>entah bah</malay>
wait wait wait so <malay>kirakan</malay> like you land in Singapore and then after that they give you the mask or like (err)
later on like the when the government give like the government (um) announced that they're going to give like they're gonna roll out like sets of masks to give (uh) you
ya we top we we top the rank [ah] isn't it we we top the list for the the number of corona virus cases <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>pasti</malay>
okay well
well as you know [lah] [kan] I came back in January as in like I think by the time it was mid January (um) there were already like
if I'm not mistaken there was already a case like especially I think around the twentieth to twenty sixth of January I think that was when the report (uh) Singapore reported their first case
but by that time (um) we actually had we we we travelled quite a bit before like <malay>kita pergi</malay> #Bangkok# for like <malay>satu minggu</malay> holiday
even though like you know there were threats of (um) like you know this unknown virus being spread around [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
like we didn't care so (err) after that when (err) Jan no actually when February rolled by we had a bigger trip
we went to Japan <malay>habis habis lepas tu</malay> was like that was when it was more heightened initially we were like thinking <malay>nak pergi ke tak nak pergi ke tak pasal</malay>
like you know the the threat of the virus is there but it's just not as severe yet so we thought like okay why not we we just go ahead
but (err) my my boyfriend was like the most #kiasu# of like the there were three of us went together so basically my boyfriend was the most #kiasu# and he was very irritating
<malay>dia pakai dia</malay> the kind <malay>macam dia pakai</malay> mask
and then is like he just insist [ah] right wearing the mask the entire time when like me and the other guy were like nah we are not going to wear a mask
<malay>habis</malay> like in the aircraft when you know when we are all confined in in a (uh) metal tube with like hundreds of (um) other people like he will refuse to wear <malay>dia punya</malay> mask and I'm like
<malay>aku tak faham</malay> so anyway
err ya so we we as in like basically most of the time we went around Japan without wearing a mask and it was quite and also like you know #Tokyo# is near
#Yokohama# no is it is it near I mean like (err) there there are lots
of like I mean eventually the the cases are like kind of like like blew up in in #Tokyo# [lah] so
(err) we were lucky to have left before that
and then after that like (err) luckily we came back right before when (err) Singapore start imposing that fourteen
days stay at home thing like the quarantine at that time wasn't like stay at home so it's like you know they were like other and (um) and whatever
sorry so ya <malay>begitu</malay> [lah] but ya then after that it's like (err)
the aviation industry went to shit then basically like a lot of my friends are losing their job and then that like you know some of my friends came back
(uh) they took unpaid leave and then after that (err) I I I <malay>tanya dia orang</malay> [lah] like [eh] so what's the deal now are we are you getting fired or like are you staying on (err) what's the situation cause it's like
you know it's very uncertain then <malay>dorang cakap macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau</malay> lucky [sia] <malay>kau</malay> (um) (um) you left at a very good time and then I'm like
ya but I didn't expect this to happen right but still you know it's very difficult for all of us so
but ya <malay>macam begitu</malay> [ah] and (err) like you I'm also looking for a job but getting there but the good thing is I'm studying
so I can balance I can juggle my life with (err) studies I can keep my time occupied [eh] and like you know just do my stuff
you do you remember that (um) the viral video that fiasco the whole #Ateeqah Mazlan# <malay>punya benda</malay> that was super funny
she need to gain sale you know technically okay I mean like you know she put she put her nose where it didn't belong so it kind of like <malay>macam padanlah muka dia</malay>
cause it's like I know I know like she means well but it's like why do you need to go and call up <malay>siapa</malay> is it or something is it I can't remember
ya <malay>habis tu apa macam</malay> like she called them and then she tries to get like answers from them <malay>dia macam nak dia berniat nak</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> I think I think her <malay>niat</malay> is not to like viral like be like isn't like to to make to close down home based business but it's more to like
spread awareness of like the current regulations that are in place (um) <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
(uh) like the current regulations that are in place (mm) related to home based business <malay>begitu</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> satisfy is like an understatement because <malay>dorang</malay> I mean like you know like <malay>melayu punya</malay> backlash is like next level <malay>dorang macam</malay> like [oh] (err)
(err) <malay>dia ni dia ni dia ni nak apa nak tutup</malay>
[kan] as in what do they say (uh) they said something about like (err) <malay>nak tutupkan</malay> (err) <malay>nak kacau periuk</malay> [ah]
<malay>periuk nasi orang</malay> something like that I don't know but it's so like ya it's well meaning but misplaced
<malay>dia macam kena dia tak kena pulau dia kena kecam dia kena kecam gila babi</malay> so funny
okay I mean I feel bad for laughing at her because I kind of know her [lah] but as in like the fact is that like stupid [sia] you should just just shut up
and like you know go and like promote other things instead of like trying to ruin other people's lives
no but the fact is that
no it's just terrible
okay I did not think that it was our good friend #Hadi# <malay>pasal si</malay>
[oh] my god stereotype [sia]
that's another unwanted
of course [lah] I mean like it it I mean he is an unsung hero I mean like during the whole like during COVID [eh] sorry during it's like people will stuck at home okay <malay>lepas tu diorang semua nak kena makan</malay> [kan]
and then half the time like for me my family everybody stuck at home so my mum <malay>macam</malay> frus
then after that she was like (err) even at times at times we we I suggest [lah] okay I say nevermind [lah] mama stop cooking why don't you just like you know call
Grab food or something
and then ya then after that like ya was great so I guess if even until now also
<malay>dia orang masih kerja</malay> like you know I mean they are adjusted out there you know I mean like more than (uh) more than ever and like
it's still a <malay>kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>kerja tu kerja</malay> [lah] but like you know
they should be acknowledged as well I feel
ya
it's true like you know I as in I'm not sure if you watched the the National day segment I mean like I only watched it for like a few hours
because it's like I had to leave for dinner after that but like they they they they featured like some <malay>macam</malay>
I won't say personalities like they I mean they picked (err) they they featured some characters like you know (um) everyday Singaporeans and everything
(um) like I think one of them was about like (uh) a guy
who is disabled and he provides like free food to (uh) the needy [lah] basically and (uh) you know they they feature all these individuals but
if I'm not mistaken or maybe you know I did not watch the whole thing but they did not (err) feature
food deliverer (uh) like you know food delivery people riders
so I mean they they they they how to say they lauded like (um) healthcare workers which they should but I guess there are more people out there who deserve
(err) like you know like for example they they do a they did a feature on like the (uh) cashiers and the people who who do the stock and replenish
the <malay>apa tu barang barang</malay> for the (err) how do you say the the items for the supermarket [kan]
that there was a there was a segment on that but I think there as in like maybe like
how how long is that show two hours is like <malay>dua jam</malay> I don't think you can like squeeze everything together [lah]
[oh] really
[oh] it wasn't cheap
(mmhmm) but I think that
I don't know as in like the I think that like like a lot of other industries is very temporary it's a very I won't say is not a long term job but it's a very
highly taxing job for example [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like in a family a a low income family of like for example <malay>dia punya anak dia</malay> (err) <malay>anak dia</malay> special needs kid
<malay>habis lepas tu</malay> the parents are like you know they got retrenched or something and then they're older <malay>habis dorang tak ada</malay> they don't have the means to go and rent a car and stuff like that there's still a lot of things to consider
(um) you know as in like to bridge the income gap between the low in I mean like the low income and the people who are earning more than them
and the fact is that a lot of people fall between
like the lines of they are how do you say this they are like (um) not considered
people who are like who are eligible for like <malay>macam</malay> help because for whatever reasons they earn
more than like slightly more than the the particular (um) like income ceiling for example and then after that like <malay>macam</malay> (err)
how do you say this I need to gather my thoughts cause it's like (err) very it's a very sensitive not not exactly very sensitive but it's like it's something that I put quite
a lot of thought in it but I just cannot encapsulate it in words so is like <malay>macam</malay> you know like when you when you read something and then you have thoughts
in your head then after that suddenly is like you when you come when you try to like say it out then it turns out like bullshit so ya
[eh] what
but in order to in order to get
(mm)
but like no but as in like don't you have to don't you have to as in like that Grab takes a good load of commission like
cut from like for example if you earn hundred dollars right I if I'm not mistaken like Grab takes about
you were the one who digressed
don't blame me for that
not bad but you know what usually we talk for longer is like we'll sit there for hours talking about nothing
so is like ya I don't know and we talk about like a couple of different topics also sometimes so <malay>macam</malay> I guess
being recorded feels very strange
ya more seventy days seventy something days my friend
well not really as in like I I at school during circuit breaker circuit breaker's thirteen April right so it was a interesting time for me like (err) because (err) <malay>apa</malay>
right school
so like school as usually I have to go back to school a few times a week right and then after that (um) like
(err) the the the the whole thing about like the virus like spreading (err) (um) like how do you say the community cases in in in Singapore started increasing
and then after that they started to implement like a lot of different measures and then it was very <malay>leceh pasal</malay> like you know because
there were at least <malay>macam</malay> twenty people in the class then after that like (err) we
(err) our like everytime we have to go and take temperature and then we have to stick that stupid sticker wherever on like you know our body or whatever and half the time it's like stuck
on my card holder and then after that is like you go to school and then that is like there's so much uncertainty
then like we all thinking [lah] like [eh] so how [ah] you think that next year [ah] no sorry next sem which is like in a month (um)
we will do it at home or what because it's like a lot of other schools already are are are doing like home like
you know home based learning and then after that we were the only ones who are still not doing home based learning so <malay>macam kita</malay> very move very FOMO
so so (um)
(err) we we were like somehow like quite happy that (uh) we managed to no no actually we received an email saying that okay we're going to test out like you know Zoom
then (err) then we we tested out the Zoom (err) interface then it of like sucked [lah] because it's like you know Zoom and then with all the security issues and everything
then (err) we had exams
and this was the very funny part so <malay>kita orang punya</malay> exams we <malay> kita ada dua exam like
for for one research module and another one [eh] <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
what is that module I took I forgot [oh] (uh) it's a wellbeing module so basically right in an actual exam is like a set format and then after that in like
we were revising and basically we were revising based on (err) what the exam usually entails [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like
like like <malay>ada</malay> <malay>ada</malay> open ended and stuff like that and you based on like going to school and sitting for the exams then COVID happened
so basically we were stuck at home so (err) like the school has to think about something
(err) so that time <malay>nak</malay> like in the end we for the first time in my life actually I did an online exam can you imagine back in when I was working [ah]
for like all those four years I never had an online exam before so ya very interesting so we we we sat at home
and then we we did our exam pass everything then after that we continued the new semester and this time was like online
it's open book as line like they know okay wait there's this one let me like
(uh) there was one there was one module there was one module where they say it was closed book <malay>tapi kita orang macam</malay> like
[eh] get real [lah] <malay>kau ingat apa kita orang tak akan</malay> you know go on Whatsapp <malay>lepas tu kita</malay> text [eh] <malay>kau tahu tak</malay> what's this what's the answer for this but in
<malay>tak ada tak ada</malay>
so it's like (um) basically we were (err) there are there are like three different kinds of exam so <malay>macam</malay> like open task
so this open task (err) is like
a forty eight hour it opens like (uh) forty eight hour window so from like for example right now is one thirty right
and then (err) it opens at one thirty then after that is like you you do you can do the the exam at anytime and then after that it's like (err) by one thirty on
let me see Saturday it will close and then there's another one where it's time
so <malay>macam</malay> like we get on we we all got go online <malay>lepas tu</malay> we all sit down together
<malay>buka tu</malay> link <malay>duduk</malay> for two hours <malay>ku duduk situ</malay>
<malay>kau buat tu</malay> (err) exam just like a normal exam <malay>tapi</malay> (err) <malay>ni</malay> in the comfort of your own home <malay> begitu
well nothing because okay for that <malay>macam</malay> the time exam [kan] the time exam is like you cannot hire anyone to do it for you
because number one where in the world are you gonna find someone to do that time exam for you and number two I think you are more
you are more focused on looking for the answers then go and find someone to do the exam for you come on [lah]
okay
maybe people do that maybe people do that but
for me [ah] I personally I rather do myself [ah] because I know I can do it
so it's like it's the thing where I mean like <malay>ada</malay> forty eight hours exam that I had recently it was like
it was basically an assignment so was like like three assignments put together and then it was like based on ten marks like ten marks each can you imagine it's a assignment so basically I had to do (err)
stuff !hais! like I prepared questions prepare prepare press release and also a speech
and I have to do that all and all of them are ten ten marks only then I was like
[ha] you <malay>memang betik</malay>
usually it's twenty five marks and I spend like more than two days doing one assignment then after that like this exam you have to sit down and do this shit for forty eight hours I cannot
deal but I finished it in like less
I did I did it was fine
well you know do you know
well you know why I went back to school anyways is not because I want I mean isn't that at some point in my life I want to [lah] as in like you know when I left
when I left (err) when I graduated from poly I did go to school after that but obviously after like what how many years
[eh] thirteen thirteen ya after thirteen years of like education straight and I wasn't exactly doing very well in school also cause I was so fucking playful [ah] sorry
I was so damn playful and then like and then
and then after that it's like I can't I don't think I could have like continued my studies then so I went out to work [lah]
I enjoyed my life met so many many different people <malay>habis lepas tu</malay> like now (err) <malay>bila</malay> I'm like more settled a little in life sort of
I decided to go back to school to get that degree and [oh] my god the characters I have to deal with
is like is like
there have
I do not no I really
(mmhmm)
(ugh) I'm doing a media and communications course so definitely there is project I mean like whatever that I'm doing now is no different than what I was doing
eight years ago holy shit it was eight years ago ya eight years ago when I was in poly except that during poly it was a more intensive
like not intensive like what we learned there was extensive [lah] I really enjoyed my poly life even though I kind of like played around a lot
but like for for uni it's a bit more difficult especially now <malay>pasal</malay> like (err) how to say this like (um) I'm much older than I was obviously
and that like my dad told me that you know don't don't
don't mess it up [lah] you mess it up once and then after that is like if you mess it up again I don't know what to say about you
and also the fact that I have a support from my boyfriend obviously and that he is very intent on seeing me get the (err) that that degree
and so it kind of like motivates me a little and it helps that that because it's like I am more focus I guess I mean like you know like kids right
I totally get it [lah] okay like my my classmates [ah] my my my friends are all like twenty twenty one years old and then there's this girl
<malay>dia pandai tahu dia pandai</malay> she graduated from mass comm [eh] no she graduated from advertising
#Ngee Ann# similar course <malay>tapi dia punya dia punya</malay>
distracted <malay>tak tak boleh tahan</malay> so I had a project before just like <malay>macam</malay> like maybe two weeks ago ya so <malay>dia sibuk dengan dia punya</malay> boyfriend <malay>punya</malay> birthday
<malay>habis lepas tu dia punya kerja macam</malay> you know it's a group work
so <malay>nak kena betul betul nak kena duduk</malay> and then discuss <malay>lepas tu nak kena tulis apa apa</malay> in a powerpoint
presentation <malay>nak kena</malay> prepare <malay>pasal kita orang ada</malay> presentation and then after that we have to write a report also
the report was about one thousand five hundred words and we have to write it together can you imagine
two people writing the same report is a mess and a fact is is that <malay>kita kena buat</malay> like a very intensive research initially and then after that is like after that it's like more of like a solution finding kind of thing
so because I know what she's capable of and she's so distracted and besides I have nothing better to do in my life [kan]
I said to her okay you know what <malay>aku buat aku buat yang</malay> lit review <malay>punya</malay> part <malay>lepas tu yang lain lain semua kau boleh buat senang</malay>
so basically we had like a google docs where we had a dumping ground of like <malay>macam kita orang punya</malay> (um) information and everything
and then the only thing she needs to do is to just write the bottom part of the the the essay the report <malay>itu pun dia tak boleh buat</malay>
and
the fact the fact is like I ain't going to do that but as in like okay so <malay>dia boleh</malay>
<malay>dia boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>pergi mana mana</malay> like <malay>dia punya</malay> boyfriend <malay>dia punya</malay> twenty third birthday <malay>dia pergi</malay> prepare all the <malay>apa tu</malay>
gifts for him <malay>bagai</malay> can you imagine twenty three birthday presents
if she has the effort to prepare the twenty three birthday presents you can bloody well do your assignment you know
tell me about it the fact that she can afford twenty three birthday presents and they are of varying price tags really intrigued me
because is like even though when I was working <malay>tak ada</malay> chance my boyfriend has ever going to get X number of presents however old he is from me
[eh]
<malay>itu</malay> part time just
I really I really salute them for that because I cannot do that
I
no man I like my sleep I enjoy my sleep and you know sometimes okay [lah] I I don't think my my (err) my lecturer's gonna hear this I'm just going to say it like you know because we are on
we are online (uh) we doing online lessons right now [kan] so like half the time <malay>kita</malay>
(um) <malay>kita</malay> log-on like at 9 o'clock
in the morning and then after that you are on I'm still on my bed and then I'll be like listening to a lecture
and then it's like this particular lecture (uh) eleven (uh) sorry in on Monday mornings is just a drag cause it's like she constantly wants
us to participate know like you know breakout groups you know that kind of thing and <malay>leceh gila</malay> then I was like (err)
<malay>tak nak</malay> [ah] <malay>malas</malay> [ah] but like so basically like for how many weeks eight eight eight weeks (um)
it's it's kind of like the same routine
so basically I know from nine to nine thirty at least I can get like an extra shut eye then nine thirty she will break us into one group which means that I have to turn on my mic and talk
still in my bed and then after that like when they are discussing then after that you know I'll try to make an effort to get off my bed and then after that <malay>duduk dekat atas meja</malay> [lah] and do my work
and then !huh!
shut up ya anyway so I mean like I'll get up to do my work and then after that it's like by the time (err) by the time it's
ten o'clock ten thirty I will be like more refreshed to actually you know participate in the class ya so apparently I'm not the only one who does that [lah] so sometimes like and I I I mean like I am
for some reason like that class I made a lot of friends and we don't see each other on (err) in real life you know we haven't seen I haven't haven't see my classmates most of them this
this semester so I <malay>macam</malay> like to be able to connect with them in a level (err) I mean like online everything is very cool
actually this sounds like internet the internet games we used to play as children
<malay>apa punya</malay>
that
yes it is a word I think
I'm the complete opposite of you like I really enjoyed circuit breaker time it's like
ya you spend more money on that shit then you sit at home and the snacks is there so I sit at home
yes
well no as in like the fact is that you know during the whole circuit breaker time I only ordered in food
four times ya but basically
ya
for free [eh] (uh huh)
(mm)
as in this particular Food Panda thing <malay>dia punya</malay> promo [jer] <malay>daripada dulu ke baru sekarang baru saja</malay> as in like (err)
no because
no no no like like periodically right periodically (um) (err) Grab host like have this like (err) promo like not promo ya promotions where they offer (um) a monthly subscription of like
six dollars or something and then [oh] no sorry the most recent one I think was thirty dollars and then you have like an offset of like
(uh) the four dollars delivery charge for four dollars off delivery charge or something so during the circuit breaker right
none of this shit was like available because obviously people a lot of people are gonna stay home right and they're gonna order food so (err) ya
and then (err) so isn't like basically is this was this (uh) service available on (err) Foodpanda even like during the circuit breaker
of course [lah] because now everybody can go out already [what]
ya true but people cook
yup my boyfriend gets to stay at home for the next four months

(mmhmm) true true true true true
I mean to me it's good in a way like (um) all the lessons are pre-recorded so like I mean in times like you are not really focus during the class or the period of that class you can always go back to (um) the recordings [lah] because like if we ya I mean like
ya but you you don't really get the quality of the teaching [ah] like ya as you said [ah] traditional traditional methods are the best [ah]
but then ya obviously but then I mean like what can we do right in the midst of this pandemic like !aiya! I appreciate [lah] they they still continue classes through online cause like some of our friends like
from like ya from different universities they don't even have like those online classes right ya
(mm) (mm) and ya I I mean
I really appreciate for the university swift updates and all [lah] like they really accommodate to the international students I mean like they have to since it's an it's international university
and all right ya [lah] I really appreciate that part ya
(mmhmm) I mean
okay it's really draining
(err) cause like the
the usual physical examination like we had the the ya I mean usually we we (uh) our exam <malay>punya</malay> duration would be like three hours right
ya then (um) like this time round it's like six hours and ya there's this one subject I mean the exam was like
for two days [ah] for forty eight hours [ah] so that was really crazy [ah]
I I couldn't sleep well I couldn't even eat well or like even rest [lah] because like I mean like each time you want to do like your own stuff or like
(um)
(uh) know
ya like
cause ya but but but but it's not the usual [ah] question answer kind of thing [ah] cause ya ya cause it's like (um) I'm taking it (uh) for this for this forty hours exam is like it's it's it's (err) what's the subject [oh] education secondary (uh) educational psychology <malay>nya</malay> subject so it's like
(um) (hmm) so they gave us forty hours to like do I mean (uh) I need to do videos presentation videos so I mean ya it's
it's very like (um) it's very and for the for the amount given ya but also for the amount given [lah] so it's really appropriate [lah] I would say reasonable reasonable timing
ya
ya (mm)
ya but then I mean like if if they were to shorten it I don't think I can finish in time [ah]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] like (err) initially I was like
(um) ya ya ya cause like my my lecturer told us [lah] (err) beforehand she was like (um) ya for educational psychology ya you guys have an exception of like forty eight hours for the exams then we were like !huh! really forty eight hours then she she she was like
[ah] later you see the questions and you know why I give you forty eight hours
so ya so when I'm given the question then I was like
okay now I understood why
but ya I mean

but then ya she mentioned [ah] like cause ya cause the university asked them to do so

[eh] <malay>ada satu yang bagus punya</malay> wig

!whoa!
okay
I would ask for a a car
<malay>kereta</malay> I will ask for a car and I also ask for money
and I will also ask for an unlimited supply of <malay>kasut</malay>
shoes
for anything any type of shoes I would want
so like so <malay>pape kalau aku nak main bola ke main</malay>
<malay>takraw sepak takraw ke boleh</malay>
<malay>pakai apa apa-apa kasut</malay> [lah]
so ya
so what about you #akid#
okay okay
actually <malay>pandai</malay> [ah]
but I think also genie <malay>sesuai kalau</malay> genie is the one granting your wishes [ah]
you know what I mean
so ya
(hmm)
genie
genie the people who grant your wishes
genie
but I also think genie also have their own set of rules that you cannot ask for more wishes of these things [what]
you never know you know never know
the world is like super mysterious [what]
(hmm)
<malay>entah</malay>
<malay>tahu</malay> I know I know but then for for shoe right
[ah] since I already have money right
but I only can ask for this much amount of money
so right if I want to buy shoes right
the money would confirm go down right
<malay>cam</malay> [ah] <malay>makin turun turun turun banyak duit</malay> so like
[ah] if I just for unlimited amount of shoes for any type of sports I want right
my money won't go down and I still have time for shoes [what]
so you get where I'm going from
and you know <malay>kereta untuk</malay> you know <malay>gi sini gi sana semua</malay>
for my love life I think
so <malay>kalau kalau aku</malay> [dah] <malay>ada duit ada kereta</malay>
<malay>kasut</malay> is for my own needs [ah] but
these two things already I think is already up there to get like
the girls I want not saying they're they're gold-diggers or anything but like
I'm saying that it would help me
a part to get girls [lah] like a love my love life to kickstart my love life I would say
so ya
so what so what
why you keep talking to me about your love life #akid#
what is wrong with your love life
<malay>apa yang</malay> like
<malay>tak</malay> worth it [lah] of course it's not gonna be worth it what because like
because like you know (err)
you can't
hate everything this I mean if you hate everything in this world right
like you don't like love right then what's the point of living you know like what is the point of living so if you hate everything if you hate everything right then
your life would be <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak</malay>
life <malay>tak bagus</malay> [ah]
easy to say it's like it won't be good [ah] everything will just be everything [oh] I hate this I hate that so like your life would be just be full of hate [ah] so like
so like you know [ah] sometimes right you need to think about
worth it [ah]
<malay>dapat semua benda</malay> [pe]
living
so you trying to say that
you need to work hard in life [ah] for things
like a little purpose
purpose to living for living
[ah]
I mean everybody has their own opinion [what]
their own opinions in life
like <malay>dorang nak apa</malay> like
<malay>sorang ada sorang nya</malay> opinion [pe] so like <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you know if our opinions are different right then it is what it is [ah] like ya
so first first first [kan] <malay>aku nak perempuan lawa punya</malay>
[ah] <malay>kalau kalau tak lawa aku tak nak</malay>
!chey! just joking but ya of course [ah] I want a pretty lady in my life and
<malay>hati-hati kena bagus macam</malay>
<malay>hati kena bagus</malay> [ah] <malay>macam hati dia kena bagus kena macam aku nak dia</malay> caring loving
(uh) show respect to my parents like that kind of girl [ah]
in that's what I look for in a girl [ah]
<malay>faham faham</malay>
(mm)
okay we talking about this minor details in women that I look for of course there is [lah] there are a few [ah] so I'll tell you about my life [ah] like I can be honest [ah] <malay>dalam hidup aku</malay> [kan]
<malay>aku keluar dengan tiga perempuan</malay> [jer] [tau]
<malay>tiga perempuan</malay> the first one she can make me laugh she (uh) <malay>boleh buat aku ketawa semua</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> take it one step too far she make me laugh too much
she doesn't take anything seriously she's just too who to say [lah] like too playful [ah]
like <malay>macam dia suka main-main aku</malay> text <malay>tak nak</malay> reply <malay>semua</malay> then <malay>abeh berbual</malay> serious
serious <malay>punya benda dia</malay>
<malay>dia macam buat macam kelakar semua</malay> then you know
it's not serious so the second one is she is too serious the second one is too serious for me
she [ah] <malay>dia tak boleh</malay>
handle jokes <malay>semua</malay> then <malay>kena aku selalu kena</malay> care for her [ah] like
<malay>takleh kena takleh kena sikit ke apa</malay> [ah]
then <malay>bila berbual dengan dia</malay> [kan]
<malay>nak buat macam</malay> joke <malay>kelakar semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dia dia nak sepak aku sepak muka aku ke apa</malay> [ah] <malay>nak cari gaduh</malay> so the third one right
she's a good mix in between [ah] like she's very serious can make me laugh and she's a nice person overall [ah]
but then turns out I'm not her type [ah] so if that that one I cannot do anything [ah] but
what I really look for in women right is ladies of course [ah] every guy want every guy want a girl that can make them laugh you know every it's just a super good bonus [ah]
so ya of course I also would want a girl that
makes me laugh and one of the key things for me is that she must be very
is it weird that I don't want a girl
to be needy you know like I don't want her to be too needy like <malay>selalu</malay>
like <malay>dia selalu macam</malay>
<malay>cari aku dia nak ni dia nak ni</malay>
so like <malay>semua benda semua benda dia</malay>
like <malay>cari aku</malay>
then <malay>aku kena pergi sana jumpa dia berbual dengan dia dia nak nangis aku kena gi sana semua</malay>
so ya that is one thing I totally do would not want [ah] I want I want my my
I want my like future girlfriend
maybe not to be so needy
<malay>cam dia tengah</malay> contact <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>satu orang satu laki ke kau takut</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay>

<malay>kalau aku fikir balik</malay> [ah] <malay>aku tak tahu pun aku asal aku nangis</malay>
it's like you know when you thought you found the one
like you know like
I know I mean relationships are bound to have ups and downs moments [what] but then like
there are definitely more ups than downs [what]
so right when I'm going through the ups right
I feel like [oh] this girl is like really made for me you know it's like fated [ah] some would say
so ya
but then when she
<malay>minta dia nak minta</malay> break
<malay>dia nak minta</malay> breakup then <malay>aku</malay> [dah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> [lah] like we never say anything but we there was no like

so like you try to you know talk to her [lah] but she didn't

like the perfect wife [ah] <malay>boleh cakap</malay>
so like ya [lah]
[a'ah] [seh]
this one <malay>aku tanya kau</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> [kan]
in this world [ah]
if you can get anything for free right what would you want
<malay>tak</malay> this is different because right anything you want for free
free it's not about the three wishes
the three wishes was another thing
but
[a'ah]
<malay>satu benda</malay> [jer] <malay>benda</malay> free
<malay>apa-apa kau nak</malay>
<malay>makanan</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay
<malay>tak tak muak ke hari-hari makan</malay> Pizza Hut
so what did you leave her for someone
(mm)
so like you pretty much just stalk her first [ah] <malay>cam tengok orang ni macam mana</malay>
so <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
the more you get to know her the more you feel like it
<malay>ni perempuan macam</malay> not bad [ah]
<malay>cam</malay> this is the [one] [ah]
ya relationships is has its ups and downs so it's okay
(mm)
so like just out of the blue she just kind of said she lost feelings [ah]
<malay>kira</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> fade [ah]
ya
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] that's good that's good
[ah] to be honest [ah]
it depends on how the break up went [ah]
<malay>kau faham tak macam</malay>
<malay>macam kalau kita punya</malay> break up <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau punya macam senang macam</malay> just ended smoothly like no hiccups or anything then okay [lah] <malay>boleh jadi kawan tapi macam</malay>
<malay>kawan pun bukan macam</malay> best friend <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kawan macam</malay> low-key <malay>macam boleh cakap</malay> [ah] hi bye friends [ah]
<malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> technically <malay>kawan tak</malay> [ah] you know what I mean
it's like
ya
so like
but then <malay>kalau</malay> break up <malay>macam rabak kita macam gaduh semua</malay> [kan] <malay>tu</malay> like
try <malay>jadi kawan balik macam susah</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
what's the point [kan] ya
so like so like after your break up then you all became friends or
didn't [ah]
look for any other partners everything going to stay as friends [ah]
do you still searching for love or anything
[ah]
[oh]
[ah]
[ah] okay
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[eh]
(mm)
[ah]
you just try to care for her [lah] like just be there for her be a friend that is
for be you just want to be there for her like a friend that cares [ah]
[ah]
that's
that's a super hard question [ah] because like people like you and me we are like totally two different type of people you know so like
<malay>untuk aku</malay> [kan] like [ah] <malay>kalau aku</malay> just break up then <malay>aku nak</malay> move on it takes me like at least at least [ah] four months I would say
four or six months
depends on hard
the break up ended [ah]
like
it really depends on the person [ah] like <malay>kalau aku cam</malay>
<malay>kalau aku</malay> handsome <malay>gila ke apa ke</malay> then (uh)
<malay>senang-senang dapat perempuan semua aku tak</malay> [kan] move on
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>berapa berapa lama</malay> [kan]
so like ya so like I'm trying to say that
different people have different paces in moving on [lah]
so like maybe for you right how long did you take to move on from this [one]
were you still moving on
ya
(mm)
your second girl your ex [lah]
[ah]
is I mean it's not wrong to care about like what is she up to you know
it's not wrong [ah] it's not completely wrong <malay>tak salah</malay> [pe] <malay>kalau cam</malay> care <malay>pasal</malay> ex <malay>kau ke apa</malay> it's not wrong it's like
<malay>macam</malay>
how you say [ah] like you like imagine if you lost your phone right and <malay>kau hilang</malay> then
<malay>tu benda tu</malay> phone <malay>kau takleh cari mana-mana</malay> [dah] <malay>hilang</malay> [dah] <malay>hilang</malay> [ah]
<malay>ni mesti macam</malay> two years down the road two years the road <malay>kau mesti fikir balik</malay> [eh]
phone <malay>aku</malay> [dah] <malay>aku rasa kat kat sini ke</malay>
you get what I mean
so it's like
it's like that [ah]
it's like something that is lost can never be found again [ah]
<malay>dorang cakap</malay> [ah]
people say this one
so like ya
(ugh)
ya
totally not wrong
(mm)
in my in my relationships [ah] my past love life and all these things right
it's like it totally comes down to me [ah] I feel like sometimes I don't put too much effort like I feel I always put
sometimes there's always this thing
where I always feel like I don't put enough
effort and I put too much effort you get what I mean
so like <malay>macam</malay>
example [eh] example <malay>macam</malay> one of the times (err)
<malay>ni perempuan dia nak berbual dengan aku dia sedih dia nak</malay> she needs someone to talk to [ah] pretty much so I just decided like <malay>macam tapi aku aku tengah main</malay> game
<malay>kau tahu</malay> game [kan] <malay>macam</malay> phone <malay>nya</malay> game then <malay>aku macam</malay>
[eh] [sial] [lah] <malay>aku nak main</malay> game <malay>tapi ni perempuan tengah nangis ni aku nak buat apa</malay> [sia]
so like
I I just give another <malay>macam aku kasi</malay>
<malay>alasan</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>aku</malay> busy [ah] <malay>berbual nanti boleh tak</malay> see like
there's stuff I did like I totally regret now [ah] like
imagine if I did I didn't do that in the past I would I might still be together with her now you know like
it's like of course [ah] I I I feel like sometimes I
I <malay>macam tak</malay> (uh) <malay>buat banyak</malay>
<malay>buat banyak salah</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you know I do a lot of wrong [ah] in relationships [ah] but
you know I'm still young also like as you said like I'm still young also so like even you leave and you learn [ah]
so like [ah]
(mm)
it's like you just live [ah] like your future self think about that in the future [ah] I get what you mean
so like ya like you know [ah]
you always got to know [ah] sometimes it's not always your fault in the relationship [ah] so like
you know you always got to tell yourself
it is what it is [ah] like <malay>kalau benda tak</malay>
[ah] go the way you want it to then
sorry man

<malay>fikir</malay> what you have right in front of you like
[oh] I don't have money now what should I do
or should work and earn my money like that
it's like you don't really think about future I mean you should think about your future when you're getting older but right now <malay>cam sekarang</malay> [kan]
<malay>kita jangan fikir</malay> just live in the moment [ah] it's like
you know like you never know you might just blink your eye and then you be thirty plus forty plus in the future

<malay>aku tengok</malay> drama [jer] the world of married
it's about this girl she's very successful <malay>macam dia jadi</malay> the associate director
of all doctors I think or of doctors in her company then she got
a husband that looks younger but is actually the same age as her [ah]
then what happened is that her husband is actually cheating on her
in the first place <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> whether she
he really cheat <malay>dekat dia ke tak</malay> eventually [ah] she found out [ah] and about the girl and everything
then there's a lot of drama with the girl cause the girl <malay>macam</malay>
although <malay>dia tahu</malay> that he is a married man <malay>dia tetap nak dengan</malay>
that guy [ah] then that eventually
(um)
because the guy has always been <malay>macam</malay>
living off from her wealth
so <malay>dia</malay> the wife
was actually very very very
(um)
afraid that he would take every everything of her wealth
the son everything from her
so she plan her divorce properly
then but then in the end <malay>dorang</malay>
(uh) <malay>cerai</malay> [lah]
then <malay>cerai</malay> the the wife manage to take all her wealth back
and left the guy with nothing
actually there's a lot of drama [ah]
but I'm just like summarizing then
two years later the guy actually became very very successful and he
he got married with the girl
but actually I think he still have like
feelings of
like if you hate someone so much right maybe you actually kind of like love them also I don't know
or like leftover feelings from the marriage [ah] because
actually he got say that
he like he love
both of them
ya and then like
people can say how how is that possible how can you love two women at the same time and then he keep on saying that
I love
(uh) you you don't understand unless you in my situation but I really love them
entire time and then he used this (uh) phrase
[ah] loving loving some falling in love is not a crime then I'm just like <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
ya
but
now like the story I <malay>masih kat</malay> episode nine so like
(uh) they got divorce but then
the (uh) kay the son right is so irritating [seh] <malay>dia</malay> [dah] <malay>besar pun dia macam</malay>
<malay>macam selenger selenger gitu</malay>
ya so
now I think the
the wife the ex-wife
is like
developing feelings for this guy
but then
(um)
she like restrained herself
cause <malay>dia tak nak</malay>
<malay>anak dia ataupun dia tak nak macam</malay> involve
in this kind of thing again [ah] drama again
ya
(mm)
but then I heard that
I mean [lah] I don't know cause #Syamsul Yusof# has always been
[ah] <malay>banyak</malay> how to say [eh] <malay>banyak</malay> rumours <malay>pasal dia</malay> like you know remember about Diana Danielle also
ya
but I think that is the risk of falling in love [what] like you cannot expect the person you love to today to be the same person tomorrow like they will always change
ya and Bella
but they got back together
but he has a long list of crime record here in Malaysia I mean in Singapore [kan]
because I heard that he stole something and everything
I mean he really got really really <malay>macam</malay> soul soulless again
but
I don't know [lah] how to say about him but I feel that he keeps on screwing things over and over and over again
[oh] wells
ya
ya
but
I don't know [lah]
[ah] up to him [lah] he celebrity [lah]
but you know (um) you know I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [seh] if I want to do my hair tomorrow <malay>ke tak</malay>
ya the original price is about three hundred fifty [seh] and hundred fifty for three hundred fifty treatment
then right I see their steps like firstly they will like massage
then after that they will like put essential oil for you to relax then they will put something for your scalp then they wash
then after that they put like this
beads then they crush it then they put like the medicine the carotese medicine or what
then after that they steam
after they steam then (uh)
okay already like they blow dry
(mm) I like I mean I've booked for tomorrow but I don't know what time what time you going school [ah]

<malay>tak sabar</malay> [seh]
I never know why
well cause maybe you don't really get sense of security there like everyday it's like it's playing with your anxiety did you do something wrong or not
ya
why I mean like even if I were to continue my studies I don't think I'll be in the same school as you
is it cause you <malay>tak</malay>
(uh) used with your friends <malay>lagi kot</malay>
!huh! they you mean you don't #chiong# last minute [one]

so like one hundred fifty gone
then maybe like fifty gone for transport and like nine thirty gone for

so that would be two hundred fifty then I mean I have like fifty dollars left
like what you cannot also buy [seh] fifty dollars

ya so confirm cannot save like that
I've been trying to save
that's true some more I pay for the bill and then pay for myself

clothes but I thought I wanted to buy him body cause clothes <malay>susah</malay> [ah] for me I need to see his size all then later he cannot wear how
ya some more like clothes hard
cause I don't know whether he will like my taste
but he chose to wear it that's the thing it's
is it then <malay>tak</malay> [kan] I <malay>nak beli</malay> [kan] <malay>dia baju batik</malay> confirm <malay>dia tak beli tak pakai</malay>
no he won't wear purple he say Barney
what serious [ah]
[meh]
exactly he is
[oh] ya that's thing I <malay>takut tak muat</malay> cause
you know got like those like slim fit regular fit all then I don't know all this guy shit
ya that's why I thought just buy <malay>sapu</malay> [jer]
he can <malay>wangi</malay> himself
<malay>lagipun</malay>
that's the easiest
<malay>kalau beli</malay>
(err) clothes then you have to take into
size the design whether it fits
ya
but how is he [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
how is he coping now
in the new work and all
(mm)
<malay>tapi dia kadang-kadang suka</malay> act tough [jer]
!huh!
that's true
like long time <malay>tak jumpa dia</malay>
ya
(mm)
it's okay [lah] one day I see him [lah] slowly
(uh)
okay [lah] but maybe my next like three day off I ask him out
but then I scared he go dating [ah]
cause if he's free he will usually go dating [what]
do you like study math anymore no right
[eh] why you don't want to teach the our neighbour anymore [ah]
(mm)
because like I heard the kid is really struggling as well
ya and then like he needs to take next year and then
he skip his grades are doing really bad right now
so he really needs help
but for me personally right <malay>macam</malay>
for me <malay>mak dia tahu</malay> [seh] <malay>yang dia tengah</malay> struggle then like
<malay>mak dia</malay> just hantar <malay>dia</malay> to like those like
tuition centre
then it like didn't help him then she don't want to teach him also
then I feel that <malay>macam</malay> if you give up on your own son then what about
people outside [seh]
ya
but actually he's such a nice kid [seh] I kind of miss teaching them <malay>tapi</malay> I really <malay>takde</malay> time <malay>untuk dia</malay> !hais!
but he play with my soft toys
like when he was sick he hug
#Didi# the dinosaur
and stuff like that
like a little sick cause his mum didn't want him to skip tuition
[oh] my god I think was only fifty
ya last time you also got paid fifty right
no it was never seventy
it was always fifty #Erra#
ya that's why I stop
is like about ten [ah] eleven
or twelve dollar plus
<malay>satu</malay> hours
ya still not worth it
like I know [lah] I get it <malay>dia macam</malay> mentally draining to teach a kid
some more he's very naughty but
I don't know I just <malay>kesian</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> I just really hope that he at least
make it to like
make it well
yes true
but then that's not the end right
ya
you don't even do that much
but they still revamped a lot right
primary school <malay>pun ada</malay> [seh]
ya
but
(uh) I don't know [ah] it's like you know like how this kind of drama always happen then teachers will talk about it I just feel that the teachers should just stop talking about it <malay>macam dorang</malay> like to pry open to
people private affairs [seh]
actually right honestly I've always not be in good terms or have any good
like (err) <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>macam apa</malay> [eh] [ah] <malay>macam</malay> feeling of a good
relationship I mean
<malay>dengan</malay> teachers
ever since primary school secondary school and days
because I feel that the teachers all <malay>macam</malay> #kaypoh# you know like during my right
the discipline committee actually came down to talk to me like counsel me
and say that I should breakup with my boyfriend my ex [ah] my boyfriend
because it was affecting my studies
then I was like you don't even know me
you know
it's like
who the hell (um)
like
who the hell have time to spy on their own students [seh] but apparently they are so free because they like
some are like if like example like they like hold the couple hold hand or hug in public they will take picture and give the principal something like that [seh] and I was like it's not even illegal to fall in love
I hate I hate the old said old malay thinking like that
I <malay>tak suka</malay> [seh]
so traditional
I don't know [lah]
I mean like they are they are toxic in their own ways but I'm really really glad that we
managed to go through all that
!huh! it's not it it's not
<malay>kita tak pernah lambat</malay> I always <malay>lambat</malay> [seh]
I <malay>pernah lambat</malay>
ya that's why the third time
that was my last time
that last chance
I got it was actually the fourth time already
I usually see the discipline
master or what
no [lah] sometimes I go late
really cause that guy like make me cry before that's why I remember
then he panicked
then [oh] ya then he was not happy because I was
wearing ankle guard
then I say [eh] I injured <malay>mesti pakai</malay> ankle guard colour black cause last time we need to wear white socks right
then I'm like [eh] you want to pick fight with me cause of this <malay>merepek</malay> [seh]
don't know
<malay>tak betul</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
[oh] my god ya she is
she was so immature I don't know she was actually quite young to be a coach
I mean okay [lah] whatever you young but never mind [ah]
but she cannot handle the team well [seh]
she <malay>lepas</malay> [kan] at us so many times
I remember she just graduated from and then she was
looking
at the she was looking <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
looking into taking a degree and I think she got a degree like in sports sciences or something
ya definitely early twenties
ya she throw tantrums [seh]
I remember so many people vomited [ah]
after a suicide runs
and then I remember how she just left training halfway cause she was so angry
I don't think I think you skip
ya she left training cause she was so angry that we couldn't catch the ball
we will always like butter butter finger or something
then what [eh] I remember she do the stupid like
(err) push-up
then it was so hot the flooring
<malay>abeh</malay> like we all felt like dogs [seh]
and then I still remember that
she asked us to go
to school at as early as six just to run everyday before school
start
season period
ya
I mean like after all the effort and everything we still didn't get into second round you know
I don't know [ah]
I don't think it's because we not fit you know actually I think we were quite fit maybe it's because we don't have chemistry
they have trust issues cause they scared if once they pass to us
(err) the chances to win is lost
ya because she's crazy
ya that's true
I remember so many people stop
I remember there was this girl <malay>dia macam</malay>
like quite <malay>berbadan</malay> then like she was so <malay>semangat</malay> to go training then after that training I never see her face again
ya
ya ya
but after that you didn't join any sports until
soccer right
[eh]
ya I think I brought the trauma when trauma with me when I <malay>masuk</malay> [ah] <malay>bola</malay> [seh] <malay>masa</malay> I seventeen <malay>kat</malay> cause after that right I <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) I cannot push myself to do better like I will always stop
I feel like it's a mental block
especially I'll feel well I tired I just stop [seh]
and like I I feel it's not normal
like before every match <malay>pun</malay> I very <malay>macam</malay>
nervous <malay>semua</malay> you know
!huh!
<malay>tapi</malay>
like I'm really glad that we actually did sports last time
cause in some way or what
I feel that <malay>dia macam</malay>
help to
discipline us and make us stronger [ah]
cause imagine <malay>kalau kita tak buat</malay> sports [eh] <malay>kita</malay> confirm <malay>tak nak gi lari semua</malay> [seh] cause I see some of my friends <malay>yang tak masuk</malay> sports [kan]
<malay>dorang macam</malay> okay [jer] <malay>macam</malay> how to say <malay>macam</malay>
if they run <malay>takleh lari</malay> two point four <malay>ke apa dorang</malay> still okay [jer]

ya
anyway what kind flowers do you like
ya
<malay>tak</malay> [lah]
[eh]

hard to take in a stranger into your home and make it a home for them
you know what I mean

for transport in just one or two weeks [eh]
ya that's right
ya they always go by distance
[ah] I I really <malay>macam</malay>
but then they said that public transport is way cheaper <malay>dari</malay>
(um) okay [lah] obviously <malay>dari</malay> Grab [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> way cheaper <malay>daripada</malay> you
owe a vehicle
then <malay>macam</malay> !whoa! meaning <malay>kat</malay> Singapore vehicles are really really expensive [seh]
then I go and check [ah] <malay>satu kereta kat</malay> singapore and I'm not talking about like those nice vehicle [eh] like basic five car seater right
the cheapest is about sixty thousand [eh]
<malay>itu pun</malay> right
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>dapat</malay> the nice one [ah] usually right I think the price starts from sixty eight K
crazy [eh] you know sixty eight K in another country can buy
two three cars I think
(uh) I don't even think they have the
it's just the car
ya but then like other cars I see like two hundred thousand then got until one million all [ah]
then like even housing in singapore
is so expensive
then they said that maybe getting a condo
is better than getting a at this rate
cause of the facilities
and like condos [kan]
most of them the new ones are built near like
the <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
you got see (uh) is it Gueenstown or Redhill
the new condo right is directly opposite the
and it looks really good
ya
ya
it's small
but ya you win some you lose some
I think condos right the small small ones is like suitable for those that is like living alone or with just a partner you know
but if you have a family then maybe the executive condos or something [ah] if you're rich
[oh] my god penthouse you know there was this article <malay>yang dorang cakap</malay> they found a helicopter

I don't know him much [lah] at all but I know he is my (err) mate
and he was one of the leaders last time
then
even though I don't know him right so for some reason right out of nowhere right I cry
I cry I cry my balls
my balls out my eyeballs out
ya <malay>aku nangis gila babi</malay> #dok#
<malay>bila</malay> like <malay>babi boleh</malay> [kan]

I mean not relative or <malay>tak kesah</malay> [ah] this not my relative also my friend <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>aku tak rapat</malay>
but then when I see
and it's suddenly <malay>macam</malay> that it it strucks [tau] it strucks [tau] it strucks <malay>macam</malay> like I don't know why I cry but then it's just waterfall
then I'm like <malay>asal</malay> [eh] <malay>nangis</malay>
no I mean that's one that's one factor but before but before that was my heart like <malay>macam asal ni</malay> why am I why am I feeling this way
I ask myself [lah]
why why am I feeling this way
then
like then when I see his body he kiss kissed his forehead
then after that you go then slowly I didn't even see anyone it was crowded also [what] because everybody was like after praying
then we have our last respect cause we all we all follow a line [lah] (err) follow queue <malay>taburkan apa entah</malay> forgot what's that thing called
[ah] <malay>taburkan</malay> and <malay>cium dahi dia</malay>
then we go and we go <malay>semua</malay> crowded like very crowded so I cannot see anyone but
I started to <malay>macam rasa nangis</malay> [tau] like my eyes my eyes starts tearing up I didn't even feel like crying but it tears up
you know then then you start to tear up heavily know like waterfall like
then ya I go then I go then I see my friend the friend cry then I even I even cry
heavier [ah] I cry heavier more then like after <malay>dah habis</malay> then my friend one of my friend who is quite close to him [lah]
he asked me #zul# (err) (err) why
why (err) your why that time <malay>kau</malay>
<malay>nangis</malay> [eh] <malay>bila arwah si</malay> #faiz# <malay>meninggal kau kau sorang yang nangis sekali dengan</malay> batch to cry heavy why [ah] [oh] I just I just say like <malay>macam terasa</malay> then
that one day ya I want to die like that also <malay>orang ramai</malay>
second also (um) I scared <malay>macam</malay>
scared of death [lah] basically
scared of death [ah] since <malay>lagi buat takut</malay> that's why my heart was beating beating I scared
like one day all these happen <malay>angkat jenazah</malay> that will be you one day [lah]
<malay>gitu-gitu</malay> so
and you don't know what what happened to you after that [what] you know
only I known no one can
ya [lah] can <malay>macam</malay>
no one really to tell the tale [lah] in the afterlife [lah] basically so you have to go through yourself so that's what that's what
<malay>takut</malay> and <malay>risau</malay>
is the one is one of the major factors I was super scared [lah] you get and
some depends on the person also the person also can change
any person [lah] like like that <malay>jenguk</malay> ya emotions [ah] like also like visit <malay>jenazah</malay> also also change <malay>macam</malay> they have a new perspective of things how it's supposed to be <malay>gitu-gitu</malay> then <malay>macam</malay>
ya [lah] so
sometimes
<malay>benda ni</malay> eventually we all have to go through
you have to <malay>macam</malay> face it that's that's how reality [lah] sucks [ah] we cannot live in a fairy tale forever also as long as we are happy happy happy one day
we but you have to expect one day
<malay>benda-benda benda tahi akan jadi</malay>
so
ya [lah] but in the mean time since we are still alive we just we just <malay>kita</malay> just pray for each other [lah] for safety you know <malay>gitu-gitu</malay>
but ya [lah]

hi kira
what are you doing
I I ask what are you doing
what are you doing <malay>bukan</malay> how are you doing
[oh] ya I forgot how is your <malay>haus kau batuk lagi ke</malay>
(mm) cause <malay>aku perasan juga</malay> like I notice your cough in your (um) videos I notice that your voice is like almost gone you know and (um) and also like when you have <malay>kahak</malay> in your throat and then you like you need to clear it before you talk then I'm like why is she speaking like this why is she not (um) clearing her throat first before she talk
ya I didn't know now I know at that time I was like
<malay>kenapa dia ni macam gini kenapa dia kenapa dia tak dia tak rasa sakit ke</malay> and then turns out that you've been having bad coughs like for a long time so how is it is it better now that you started your medication
[oh] okay [lah]
have you how many times you had to use it so far
<malay>susah tak nak pakai tu</malay> like how did you know how to use it did you like Google it because if it was me I would have to Google it
[oh] I think I think I saw that but I think I saw that like <malay>lambat</malay>
[orh] <malay>kalau tak kau macam tak boleh nak nak</malay> inhale like deeply [ah]
must be hard because actually now I'm better but I think when I was in school <malay>pun</malay> I used to have bad coughs <malay>yang dia tak teruk tapi dia lama</malay>
[ah] I used to have to eat a lot of (um) cough medicine but I didn't it didn't get like too bad that I had to go to clinic [lah]
(mm)
I did not know that I think at that time my my sinus was (err) developing my sinus allergy so actually one of my (mm)
symptoms when I'm like having an allergic reaction is that I have a throat I have phelgm
I have <malay>kahak</malay> so I have a lot of <malay>kahak</malay> that goes in my throat and then also in my nose like in this area so <malay>dia macam satu</malay> it's the same thing where it's like all over the place
[ah] so <malay>macam sekarang ni</malay> I can recognize it [lah] when I'm having when I'm having a sinus allergy reaction
<malay>macam</malay> at that time I think I didn't know cause [ah] before
how do I what
actually (err) is a lot better that I can eat chocolate now the only thing I'm not eating right now is (um) <malay>tempeh</malay>
(err) <malay>roti kicap</malay>
I know I know no but ya I think these three <malay>yang betul betul</malay> I've been avoiding because
(err) at first <malay>memang</malay> I avoided everything I avoided like #vitagen# #yakult# [lah] yogurt I mean I still don't eat yogurt [ah] <malay>apa tapi macam kalau</malay> yogurt is in (mm) is like a flavor <malay>aku boleh makan tapi macam tak banyak</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia</malay> is is in at yeast allergy it's like (um) (err) fermentation is fermentation because
because yeast [kan] is a product of fermentation [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>tempeh pun aku tak boleh makan</malay> because it's like soy bean fermented
(mmhmm)
<malay>kicap pun aku tak</malay>
[ah]
ya <malay>macam tu sebab</malay> [lah] is it's hard for me sometimes to detect what I can or cannot eat because <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] because (uh) in some <malay>kadang-kadang aku makan</malay>
<malay>tiba-tiba macam ni</malay>
(err) <malay>apa gatal</malay> but actually you know (uh) when I went to clinic my it was really bad my skin was in bad condition because I just got like new <malay>macam</malay> active (err) areas <malay>yang gatal</malay> and everything
and he asked me if I started to eat any vitamins recently and I did I started because before that I had a very bad [ah] episode of sinus <malay>punya ni</malay> like <malay>selsema</malay> for like one month
so my dad told me to start (err) drinking <malay>yang</malay> effervescent tablets <malay>tu barakah</malay>
so I did and then he ask me I started (err) started drinking that and then he said that [oh] ya it's very bad <malay>padahal</malay> [kan] I look at the ingredients of the vitamin and it doesn't say anywhere that it contains (um) <malay>macam</malay> yeast <malay>ke apa</malay> but I guess is one of the by products when they make it
(err) so (err) <malay>tapi</malay> recently because I at first I <malay>memang betul betul jaga</malay> my diet and then I notice at this one time okay at this time is funny at that time it was like very very bad
but my aunt she forgot that I cannot eat <malay>kicap</malay> because <malay>kicap</malay> is such a common common thing <malay>kalau kau masak</malay> [kan]
so <malay>dia</malay>
ya ya no at that time she's making #nasi goreng# #sambal sotong# tau like leftover #sambal sotong# so <malay>dia letak</malay> [lah] <malay>kicap tu sikit</malay> just for flavour
and then I was I already ate like one full plate and then she's like #aina# I'm just like but I don't know how I don't remember how but she said that she put <malay>kicap</malay> and I was like
<malay>tapi</malay> I was already but you know I can I have medicine to help with the itching so <malay>malam tu aku macam aku</malay> [dah] ready [lah] <malay>untuk makan ubat</malay>
but I realised that I didn't react
so at that bad <malay>macam</malay> is just a little bit because when my skin is not dry so the <malay>gatal pun dia kurang</malay> [lah] I can control it so when (err) after that I realise that you know I should try to because it's been
(uh) nine months since I've been to the doctor
so <malay>macam</malay> I should start
I should start (uh)
trying out food <malay>yang</malay> I'm not eating
so I I drank like vitagen once and it was okay <malay>tapi aku kurang</malay> [lah] I don't make it a habit to drink it a lot
[ah] <malay>cuma sekarang ni aku tak makan roti</malay>
(err) <malay>kicap tempeh</malay> yogurt [jer] [lah]
actually supposed to go and see the doctor <malay>bulan enam</malay> but at that time [kan] I was [ah] I couldn't go because clinic <malay>tu dekat</malay> #tangkak#
ya #tangkak# <malay>kat</malay> #johor# but it's far [lah]
(mm)
#tangkak#
it's
(uh) is like one or two hours
you know why because is <malay>betul betul dekat hujung</malay>
<malay>betul betul dekat hujung dekat</malay> singapore like really is like there
so <malay>macam</malay>
ya
because especially because my house is (err) <malay>dekat</malay> #danga bay# which is
I think [ah] the nearest point nearest to this nearest to singapore
and then my window is facing the (um) memorial the #sungei# that goes like I can see the boats the fishermen boats <malay>ada kelong</malay> and then I can actually see the island of singapore in the distance
ya <malay>tapi</malay> I'm I didn't go to singapore I've never been to singapore
I used to because when I was younger [kan] (mm) <malay>kalau kitaorang balik</malay> #johor#
I and my parents and like their cousin and their siblings [kan] <malay>dorang semua</malay> [dah] ready <malay>bawa</malay> passport cause they would go for a not even a day trip <malay>dorang nak pergi kat dorang cari</malay> (um) like the juice fruit juices that are not here in malaysia some of the products juice juice
juice like the drink yes yes
<malay>dorang</malay> some some [ah] <malay>dorang tak</malay> produce <malay>dorang tak hantar</malay> that brand <malay>dekat</malay> malaysia
at that time [ah]
so they will go there <malay>macam</malay> is a trip for them and then <malay>kitaorang budak-budak</malay> would be left at home it's like freedom for both adults and kids
ya and then
we'll all be like so jealous !wah! <malay>tak dapat ikut pergi</malay> singapore and then I realize and I got older and I realised that singapore <malay>dengan</malay> malaysia <malay>takde beza</malay>
<malay>sama</malay> [jer] [kan] <malay>sebenarnya</malay>
I think I think it's the same also because I grew up in (um) in a neighborhood that's mostly chinese
I think is it's gonna be the same
ya it's the same I think ya <malay>sama</malay> [jer] it's just that you know at that time I was like !wow! singapore
did you (um) see
<malay>apa</malay>
ya
[ah] that's why it's at first it was hard for me because the <malay>memang</malay> my family <malay>memang suka makan roti kitaorang</malay> we can go through like one <malay>bantal yang besar tu</malay> like two days so now substitute is wraps [lah]
wrap wrap
wrap
(mm) so <malay>macam</malay> always <malay>ada tu</malay> or you know like <malay>prata yang</malay> frozen
[ah] <malay>kalau</malay> if I go to AEON I will buy the croissant
and make it a sandwich
it's croissant
(mm)
because you took because you took french and now you know how it's pronounced correctly so it's (err) you wonder that I never wonder before you told me that it's pronounced croissant
I think is
croissant
croissant croissant <malay>itu memang</malay> one of the <malay>benda yang paling kelakar</malay>
because <malay>kau</malay> [dah] <malay>terbiasa</malay>
ya <malay>apa</malay>
[kan] cousin <malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>belajar</malay>
why are you not eating
[oh]
<malay>tunggu</malay> [jer] [lah] lunch is almost lunch time
are you going to cook or [what]
usually <malay>kau yang masak ke</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya I know she's on medication also
can can
[oh] how old is she
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
(um) I think <malay>dia tak</malay> not used to the routine yet but as a experience based on my experience is a very good
(err) routine to have to moisturize and when I say moisturize [kan] it's not it's not just (um) <malay>sapu</malay> lotion on dry skin you have to be <malay>bilas</malay> with water first and then you have to pat dry and then <malay>baru</malay> you lotion because then <malay>baru dia ada</malay> moisture
(mm)
(mm)
[ah] ya ya <malay>tapi macam</malay> you know if I if I <malay>mandi</malay> awhile like
seven or eight and then I sleep at twelve before I sleep I will just
wear it <malay>bilas</malay> and then I put lotion and then is very effective <malay>kalau</malay> you moisturize it overnight
[ah] ya
[ah]
<malay>dia sendiri dia tak pandai jaga</malay> that's why you know when I was
(mm)
(mm) but when I was younger and it was bad <malay>memang</malay> my mom would <malay>paksa</malay>
like
if she caught me
(err) because sometimes it hurts tau <malay>untuk mandi</malay> cause when you have open sores and then my mum would force and she would watch me
shower
to make sure that I properly (err) you know clean and moisturize
and then she always force me to eat (um) olive supplement olive extract actually is very good
(mm) (mm) (mm)
so <malay>macam masa tu</malay> [kan] I
[ah] <malay>tak tak</malay>
<malay>yang ini yang yang aku makan ni dia</malay> powder <malay>tapi dia dalam</malay> capsule
[ah] and then [eh] that time I cannot I couldn't eat pills I couldn't swallow pills <malay>pasal kau tahu</malay> (uh) <malay>sampai menangis</malay> like I tried to eat it until I cried
and then (err) I gave up you know what I did
I open the capsule onto a spoon <malay>lepastu aku makan</malay>
it's disgusting <malay>tapi</malay>
(mm)
[oh] your your cough medication is too much
<malay>kau makan ubat</malay>
okay [lah] [kan] maybe
maybe you should try you know work yourself up you know <malay>potong tiga ke</malay> to get used to it instead of <malay>makan powder</malay> [jer]
(hmm)
[ah] you need to take your time [lah]
(mm) have you have you done the portal
<malay>tapi dia macam</malay> faulty [lah]
can <malay>jap</malay> I give you the link cause I just gave it to darren but it's like
it's like (uh) after I register <malay>tak boleh nak</malay> log in <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> website <malay>dia macam</malay> faulty <malay>tu yang si</malay> #nai# <malay>cakap semalam dengan</malay> doctor john
[ah] you when you register to use your <malay>apa</malay> <malay>punya</malay> account
(mm)
try [lah] <malay>nanti apa</malay> I think they need to (um) solve on their site before they do before you can log in
you have any idea where you gonna do your internship
(hmm) (hmm)
(hmm)
do you know
other than aquaria or you know I did go to aquaria
(mm)
I get it I get it [lah] but thing is <malay>kat</malay> you need like a car
[ah] to go to work
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [jer] [lah] I think that's that's really the only <malay>macam</malay> problem that I have
(mm)
but
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tak banyak pun tapi</malay> they haven't responded to my email
<malay>aku dia ada dia ada dia macam</malay> (err) inquiry box <malay>dekat</malay> website <malay>tu</malay>
[ah] so I I left my email and then the topic was internship and that if they receive (um) interns undergraduate internship <malay>apa</malay> ya program
<malay>tapi dorang tak</malay> reply maybe I need to email them directly
(mm)
ya actually I I agree <malay>dorang punya</malay> one of the malaysia <malay>punya</malay> government or any authorities when <malay>punya</malay> weak link weak point is that <malay>dorang punya</malay> website is very poorly handle
[kan]
because because I think the people who are in power still are like our parent's age
[ah] <malay>bukan tak pandai</malay> they don't see the need
[ah] <malay>macam kita</malay> [kan] <malay>apa-apa pun kita akan</malay> website <malay>dulu</malay> [ah] website website
so <malay>tapi aku cari</malay> [lah] <malay>kat</malay> #johor# <malay>kat</malay> #johor# <malay>pun banyak juga</malay>
more opportunity <malay>banyak tempat</malay> but it's definitely gonna be far from my house [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] as long as you know
[ah] ya
yes <malay>apa ni apa aku cakap</malay> [oh] when I was in second year
I did go to aquaria [kan] <malay>aku pergi dengan</malay> #shikin#
and I saw (um) some of the stuff <malay>dia tengah macam</malay> recording record of the the fish and the the thing in the tank
<malay>macam</malay> like writing on the clipboard so <malay>aku tanya dia aku tanya dia</malay> (uh) <malay>kalau apa dorang ambil</malay> aquaria <malay>ni ambil</malay> intern <malay>ke lepastu dia kata dia pun</malay> intern
[ah]
<malay>dia cakap apa lagi</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya and then she said that (uh) <malay>apa</malay> I ask [lah] <malay>yang selalunya yang</malay> feeding [kan] <malay>yang</malay> diving and feeding <malay>tu dia kata</malay> anyone that has a diving license <malay>boleh</malay> I'm like [ah]
(mm)
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] I wonder also
(mm)
it's hard
<malay>jauh ke dari rumah kau</malay>
<malay>jauh</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> it's either you have a long commute <malay>atau</malay> you <malay>sewa rumah dekat situ</malay> [lah] <malay>sewa bilik</malay>
(mm) actually actually
<malay>kau tahu tak</malay> #fasha# #fasha# <malay>nak buat</malay> intern <malay>kat</malay> #johor#
<malay>sebab</malay> (uh) ya [lah] but she wants to be close with #shami# <malay>dia nak jumpa</malay> [lah]
so this so <malay>kita orang macam</malay> [dah] <malay>pernah cakap sebelum ni</malay> that if she gets an internship in #johor# I would I mean if we get in the around same area
we would rent a place together [ah]
(mm) but don't know [lah]
[ha] <malay>mari mari</malay> <malay>tapi</malay> #johor# <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>besar</malay> so we don't know [lah]
(mm) (mm) <malay>tak tahu kat mana tu</malay> [jer] [ah] when I think that
you know a lot of anxiety regarding our internship because of how it is now
<malay>macam</malay> is I'm so scared
<malay>ye tak pasti macam</malay>
I saw because I did see my brother going through his internship <malay>pun susah gila nak cari</malay> no no company would want
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tak nak bayar</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> I did see some private companies <malay>yang bagi</malay> internship not bad [lah]
I think you just have to find the right one
#wei# you apply to a lot of places and then we see what they offer [lah]
[oh] [ah]
<malay>takde</malay> I'm trying to find material for my <malay>tapi</malay>
I don't know if I can just use the paper that my supervisor <malay>bagi</malay> like
you know did I explain to you my new title
<malay>dia dia</malay> [kan] my old title was combining water quality <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) macromentoes
so I did my field work <malay>tapi</malay> since we cannot go to the lab
I'm doing the same concept but the water quality is
(uh) the data is from the paper that he published
<malay>dia</malay> [dah] published [dah] <malay>tapi dia</malay> co author [jer] <malay>dia bukan</malay> the main author doctor #chan# <malay>lepastu dia ada</malay> data <malay>dekat tempat yang sama</malay> of macromentoes so <malay>aku kena</malay> analyse the data of macromentoes compare it to the published paper <malay>punya</malay> data
yes
so
for my and I'm not sure for my introduction and my literature review should I find more or should I just use
<malay>dia punya</malay> paper as a reference for my water quality part
(um) I think I have a I think I have an idea of how to do it [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> you know [ha] I actually finding the material for me is the hardest part
ya
I also agree about the reading part
<malay>macam aku aku</malay> try the system where when I read I highlight the paragraph
<malay>pastu</malay> I go back to it and then <malay>aku akan</malay> copy paste for the whole paragraph I go I put it in my word document
<malay>pastu</malay> I try to retype it
in a different way
<malay>tapi</malay> sometimes it becomes <malay>macam</malay> disjointed because you know you're taking a lot of sources and make it into one paragraph
sometimes it feels bad <malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>gunanya</malay> supervisor
(mm) so far so far my progress is very little
are we the same
are we the same
[oh] <malay>laju kali ni</malay> supervisor <malay>kau laju</malay>
last sem
last sem <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> supervisor <malay>aku</malay> [jer] <malay>yang asik minta</malay> ya your supervisor was so quiet
I think [kan] I think she knows (uh) means she learn from last sem
<malay>sebab haritu</malay> [kan] <malay>kitaorang ada</malay> meeting mentor mentee [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> doctor #chan#
and then he said that (um) #farid# ask how we how did we do as a class
uhh <malay>macam</malay> on the our presentation <malay>dia cakap</malay>
the examiners all are impressed <malay>dengan kita punya</malay> presentation
<malay>pasal</malay> our presentation wise we are all <malay>macam mantul</malay> <malay>tapi</malay> when it comes to the writing
[ah] writing <malay>kita ada macam</malay> slack
(mm) I think it's a bit it's a bit hard to do when you're not communicating face to face with your supervisor
(mm)
I think must me and my feelings <malay>pun macam gitu macam</malay>
because especially because when you go through when you just discuss through text sometimes your tone doesn't get there
(mm) sometimes <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> [oh] my god is he like mad at me or is he like not not so not satisfied with it <malay>tapi sebenarnya</malay> okay [jer]
<malay>tak</malay>
(mm)
no but you know [lah] how she is she's very like
she's she's encouraging
(mm) I think
is like we you know we have in this other lecturer <malay>yang</malay> (uh)
the opposite
because sometimes sometimes you do have a questions that are like stupid
[ah] and <malay>tapi aku rasa macam</malay> my supervisor and your supervisor they are not the kind to dismiss that kind of questions <malay>dorang akan jawab</malay>
cause I I've had experience with it before because I did ask stupid questions ya [lah] <malay>sebab kita nak tahu</malay> [kan] we I'm I was scared of doing the wrong thing when I was going on my field trip
make sense (mm)
but you know some some lecturers like to laugh when we ask questions like that
make you feel like
(hmm)
[ah] <malay>memalukan</malay> like you feel embarrassed
did you hear about the girl
<malay>yang dekat</malay> #terengganu# [eh]
did you hear about the girl <malay>kat</malay> #terengganu#
[ah] <malay>yang kawan</malay> [ah]
#wei# <malay>tu gila</malay> [dah]
but my but they said that she's clear of drugs
(mm)
<malay>maksudnya</malay>
<malay>ye lepas lepastu dia boleh</malay> Whatsapp <malay>lagi macam</malay> acting as if like nothing
<malay>macam</malay>
[eh] <malay>bukan bukan mak dia ada kat situ ke</malay>
(mm)
(mm) <malay>macam ramai</malay> [kan] <malay>orang punya</malay> story <malay>macam banyak</malay> version
<malay>kesian</malay> [dah] like
imagine imagine the dad
wife [dah] [lah] <malay>sakit lepas tu anak dia yang anak dia yang</malay> first [kan]
but it's so sad [lah] <malay>tapi memang</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> video evidence [kan] that she entered the house
(mm) <malay>dengan apa</malay> I think like hair in her hand
(mm)
<malay>tak boleh</malay> log in [kan]
[dah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] I think you just wait [ah] because think somewhat <malay>tak boleh tak boleh</malay>
I think someone did text the <malay>yang apa</malay> doctor <malay>jaga situ puan puan</malay> #lin# [eh]
(mm) we just have to wait and see
<malay>adoi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>apa dia</malay>
no if my mum is around I don't cook
(mm)
<malay>aku tak tolong masak aku tolong dia basuh</malay> [jer]
I do the after part
(mm)
[kan] <malay>dia macam semak</malay>
[orh] <malay>dia panggil</malay> okay [ah]
I think my
my mum doesn't ask us to help <malay>kalau dia tengah masak</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> after <malay>tu</malay> I usually just go and see [lah] <malay>tapi dia kadang-kadang dia minta</malay> [lah] <malay>minta tolong</malay>
excuse me
<malay>aku pun tapi</malay> <malay>aku kurang</malay> [lah] because <malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>tengok</malay> drama <malay>yang aku tengah tengok ni bukan dekat</malay> netflix
so <malay>macam</malay> is a lot of more steps to
to watch it <malay>tapi sebab</malay> you know K drama they are so long
<malay>macam kau kena tengok tu kau kena duduk situ</malay> for an hour to watch it
actually that's why that's why it
(mm)
(hmm)
ya
I didn't watch that because I saw a lot of people <malay>punya</malay> comments
but I think the K drama <malay>yang</malay> I watched that had a lot of (err) long episodes was prison playbook
<malay>itu</malay> [kan] I don't usually watch (uh) slice of life <malay>punya</malay> drama
I usually watch <malay>macam</malay> investigative <malay>atau</malay> medical <malay>tapi</malay> somehow prison playbook <malay>ni</malay>
(err) [ah] best
it's interesting and <malay>dia kelakar</malay>
<malay>dia cam</malay> just a nice balance of <malay>kelakar dan sedih ye dia kelakar</malay> more <malay>kelakar</malay> than <malay>sedih</malay>
best <malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>ada</malay> episode <malay>dia yang</malay> one one and a half hours
<malay>lama</malay>
ya #wei#
<malay>ni pun kalau sejam aku rasa</malay> [dah] <malay>lama</malay> [dah]
<malay>sebab</malay> you know I'm used to watching (um) english
english <malay>punya</malay> series english <malay>punya</malay> series <malay>paling lama pun</malay> like forty minutes [jer]
and then <malay>kalau</malay> comedy <malay>kalau</malay> comedy <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>lagi</malay> [lah] twenty minutes twenty minutes [jer]
you know what I grew up on was (um) how I met your mother
that's where I really like pick up on spoken english because I used to read a lot <malay>tapi macam tak bercakap</malay> [lah] [kan]
so when I watched it I pick up on the slang and the the the pop culture the references <malay>macam</malay> inside jokes
<malay>pastu</malay>
ya [dah] you know <malay>masa tu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia kat dalam dia kat</malay> channel hallmark
<malay>kot</malay>
and it was at eleven forty five at night every episode <malay>baru</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> my mum was (um) was very strict with this about bed times [ah] usually <malay>macam</malay> ten <malay>tu</malay> we're ready to go to sleep
so we only me and my sister [lah] my oldest sister <malay>kitaorang akan</malay> sneak out <malay>untuk tengok</malay>
<malay>pastu kalau</malay>
I don't know [ah] sometimes <malay>dia perasan kot tapi dia macam biar</malay> [jer]
I think my parents do that a lot when we were kids so that you know <malay>biar</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
let us get away because sometimes <malay>kita kena belajar</malay> [lah] to be
you know have to break the rules
especially because <malay>kitaorang</malay> [kan] <malay>ramai</malay> there's like six of us
so my parents sometimes and they used to work both of them when we were kids so I think both of them they were like
[ah] <malay>benda macam ni</malay> is like a small thing let it go [lah]
I used to <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] my sister and I would break (um) bed time
a lot <malay>sebab kitaorang nak baca buku nak tengok</malay>
<malay>baca buku yang</malay> I don't know time at first it was <malay>bagus</malay> you know but then after a while we really like bought a lot <malay>kalau kitaorang pergi</malay> big bad wolf or sale <malay>yang</malay> like ten bucks
and then we would have nowhere to <malay>simpan</malay> and then the worst part is that we have books <malay>yang</malay> we haven't read but we want to buy new
<malay>tapi</malay>
[ah] <malay>banyak</malay> [jer] <malay>sampai sekarang tak baca</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> my mom [dah] <malay>simpan semua buku dekat</malay> my grandma's house <malay>punya</malay> store so <malay>kalau nak cari balik kena cari dalam</malay> store <malay>tu</malay> but I read books on my phone now
exactly you just download the the book the E book
#wei# <malay>kau nak dengar tak aku punya mimpi yang paling aku ingat sekarang dan paling merepek</malay>
ya my my mom [eh] my parents have this friend
<malay>anak dia pun ramai</malay> tau <malay>anak dia</malay> like wait [eh] one five or six <malay>tapi</malay> <malay>semua</malay> boys
and then
(uh) the oldest one it's like us around the same age [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> the last one the last one <malay>beza dengan</malay> the second last one was like twelve years or something like that
(uh) the last one is still is still young still a child still a kid like primary school but the second youngest is our age I think so <malay>dorang</malay> handsome tau
[oh] no I'm so embarrassed
<malay>pernah aku pernah mimpi</malay> I was marrying marrying one of them but but it's not
it's not any of the siblings is another sibling
that's like doesn't exist
ya this is this is is my dream but I often <malay>memang</malay> get (err)
often <malay>memang</malay> get a really bad not really bad not bad dreams but they just like very weird dreams because
I think because my brain doesn't really shut down
<malay>tidur pun fikir</malay>
<malay>ye ke</malay>
<malay>aku jarang</malay>
<malay>aku jarang tak mimpi</malay> then
like I do get recurring dream
<malay>yang macam banyak kali</malay> one of it I can remember is that <malay>daripada aku dulu daripada aku kecil</malay> tau <malay>masa aku</malay> [dah] <malay>pandai</malay> drive <malay>lagi</malay> I always dream
that I'm driving in my family's car like the #estima#
and I don't know how to drive
but I'm really
that's like <malay>daripada dulu lagi</malay> I've been having that that one specific dream
<malay>sampai</malay> I can imagine it now
<malay>tapi</malay> actually I
I think it's interesting <malay>tapi</malay> most of the time
after I wake up
I don't really remember unless I <malay>betul betul</malay> put in effort <malay>untuk</malay> remember I won't remember
ya and then actually the the thing that I remember is the feeling of the dream
[ah] I will that's why sometimes I wake up and I'm in a bad mood is because I had a dream <malay>yang</malay>
made me [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you know it's a bad feeling
but I don't remember what the dream was about
that happens a lot to me
(mm)

we went to walk around #bugis#
but
ya then (um)
then cause I saw innisfree right then I had to buy my facial wash so I was like [eh] can we go innisfree then he was like okay can can then cause when we were talking (um) we were chatting on telegram
he we kept finding like that we kept finding out that we had a lot of
similar stuff and
not common interest it's like
we do some
similar stuff then we also buy similar stuff
all of that
stuff
so we were like creeped out
so he asked me
what
so what kind of facial wash do you buy then I say
the #bija# one then he was like
!alamak! we have to stop buying doing the same stuff then I was like
I already bought it first so
yes
ya cute cute don't even didn't even work out
[ah]
when was it it was like in
I think july okay wait we went out like second july I remember the date
then (um) like a few days later like he had a bad he got bad news that his friend <malay>meninggal</malay>
ya then I mean I'm not gonna blame his friend's death [lah] but like it went downhill from there
so cannot really say much
ya that's one thing like okay I'll give him space cause like you know <malay>orang tu baru meninggal</malay> [kan]
then
I'm not
<malay>aku tak</malay> expect <malay>kau</malay> to be like
as cheerful as you were you know
like
I give him space to like mourn his friend's death and stuff but
at some point it's
just too much I guess
when I'm
but you know how I am right
I always confront him when like I feel that it's too much or something I always confront and I always tell him <malay>macam</malay>
[eh] are you okay like are we okay that kind of stuff but like at this
like at that point in time <malay>aku tak cakap apa-apa</malay> cause
I understand and I don't want to push him too much but like
[meh]
there was no closure honestly
he ghosted me
no it's okay
honestly that last conversation [kan] he <malay>dia minta maaf</malay> cause (um) <malay>dia tahu yang apa macam</malay>
he he knows he's in the wrong [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay> then he apologize then I was like okay since you apologize you brought up the matter yourself [pe] so I included my own thoughts about that matter [ah]
then he ghost me I'm like bro
ya
over that maybe my words or something I don't know [lah] but it's just like <malay>macam</malay> I feel like he could have
kind of like told me some stuff that make me like feel better a little bit but he didn't he just like blue tick me and went away so I don't know what to do I mean I am getting over him [ah] but
I mean
but he's such a good guy though
no I'm not
full of crank
honestly I think so
but
no I don't want
if he is
if <malay>kalau dia datang balik</malay> [kan]
I will just say that (um)
friends
I don't know <malay>kalau jodoh jodoh</malay>
thumbs up and a heart
friend zone
input
ya it's a difficult situation
that's why okay that's why when I you know me I always confront stuff [pe] I feel like
it's not fair or <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> what the what the hell is this but at that point in time I wanted to confront him about him not talking to me but at the same time I'm like but he's mourning his friend so I gave him the space but I occasionally check up on him so
that should like at least show him that I care about him what but I actually do care about him is just that
at some point I feel like
yes ya and also <malay>macam</malay>
trying too hard I guess
cause I okay I I I like check up on him like every two days then he will always reply like he will always give late replies but like at least he reply
(hmm)
no cause okay the thing is when we started first started talking right he always reply me very fast maybe cause it's period [ah] but [eh]
fast replies (mm)
so but
when I think <malay>bila fikir balik</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay>
all this pain
not worth it I guess
you see we just been talking for what two three months
I don't think I don't
<malay>aku fikir dia tak akan</malay>
(um) <malay>datang balik pun</malay>
ego
you know
unless unless like what
<malay>allah allah kasi petunjuk yang aku memang untuk dia</malay>
then he will chase me and
no
(mm)
if really then I'll give in [ah] but if not then <malay>malas</malay> [ah]
now also I'm not looking also
men are trash
why are we made to be straight when #allah# create men like this
okay philosophy
philosopher <malay>tak menjadi</malay>

kind of
<malay>yang</malay> online friend <malay>tu</malay> [kan]

the third one
[ah]

[oh] my god
[oh] okay okay
is neil the one that it's like the best friend of the one that you ask me <malay>tu</malay>
is he white
men
<malay>lelaki</malay>
so <malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>sekarang kau tak berbual dengan dia</malay> [ah]
at all
I like how this time around you are okay
about all of these
(um) I got one
more news I mean
I <malay>kau ingat sampah</malay>
ya
ya that's the first one which was like in april <malay>bila aku masih berbual dengan lelaki lagi satu tu</malay>
but then like after I stop
talking to the guy I went out with a date with
on a date with
(um)
<malay>dia masih</malay> chat <malay>aku lagi</malay>
but it's not on whatsapp
it was on wechat when we first talk to each other then he's like I really want to talk to you then I was like bro
!huh!
<malay>belum belum</malay>
how <malay>dah tak boleh balik</malay> [kan] cause
<malay>dia masih sekolah kat</malay> china [kan]
so
I don't think they will get send back [ah] cause he supposed to be three years there this is his first year
so
no I didn't
wechat no blue tick
I deleted the chat
but
now I feel like I want to reply him cause okay it's not cause I have
any feelings for him again right it's just like <malay>macam</malay> why why do you want to talk to me like I thought you went back to your ex that she don't like
I don't know probably happy that you got back together then why he why do you want to talk to me again like
why
I mean the thing is I can still talk to him as a friend but like overseas friend but I mean I won't I won't fall in love with him again bro
but
it's like I just want to know why you want to talk to me okay whatever the hell you done
but like at the same time I don't want to tell him to let him feel like I have been thinking about him
and like I have been what debating but I don't think men think until that kind of part you know cause men are like simple
when they overthink it's about it's not about this
overthink about something else
games
(um)
[oh] you think about sex
no one think about feelings
stupid
(mm)
ya just like (um) why question mark
no what the heck
do you know how long it has been it's like
twenty fourth august

okay
do you think he's gonna text again I feel like he will really kind of
what do
december will be like what one year since we met
he doesn't
I don't need long I don't need a long time to know him to know how he is
but the other guy yes cause I don't understand him
<malay>tak faham langsung</malay>
cause okay the thing is right if you if I confront you about something and then he straightaway was like [oh] I'm not perfect boyfriend material blah blah blah blah like he starts off
the
debate quotation mark debate
with that sentence in particular that means we are in a talking stage right
and then he
but I guess
<malay>aku fikir dia fikir macam kita kawan</malay> [jer] <malay>kot</malay>
he did say that but like I wasn't pushy or anything
what a pussy
but ya
okay [ah] not bad
experience

like sometimes I'm like [oh] I want him back sometimes I'm like lol

and like I carry about three boxes every morning
up to the sink to cut the vegetables
my back hurts I cried bro I thought it would I wouldn't recover

it wasn't
like <malay>macam aku fikir</malay>
in <malay>dalam kepala aku</malay> [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay>
<malay>aku tak akan baik</malay> cause
I only had like two days break and then like those two days break right the pain was still there
then after that I have to do it again
so it's just like building on then when I finally didn't go didn't put in my shifts cause school was starting [kan] then
the the pain went away I was like wait [oh] okay
so I cried for nothing
but [eh] <malay>sampai mak aku risau</malay> [seh] <malay>mak aku</malay> was like
<malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>nangis</malay>
how the heck
it's pain no cannot I don't want
like I asked my mother <malay>urut</malay> also
<malay>tak hilang</malay> so I was just like
ya
like I have this trick where you lie down flat on the ground with no pillow on your head then it's just like straight straight then it will hurt but it will flatten out your back cause of gravity
so
ya but I don't know didn't really work but
the yoga pose
<malay>aku tak tahu buat</malay>
[oh]
later can
but my back not pain anymore
#inshaallah#
retail
but I don't think that is that
(um)
as painful as that cause
<malay>potong</malay>
<malay>sayur</malay>
knife
I got cut myself you know
the auntie literally was like [eh] be careful that one sharp [ah] you don't touch
I literally didn't even touch it I was just
it was just like
(um)
I don't know how to explain it it's just <malay>macam</malay>
I didn't really put force you know it was just like a
a tap or something my palm tap the knife the blade
and then I get a damn cut
and there was so much blood and the auntie scold me
the auntie was like
<malay>aku dah cakap jangan pegang kau pergi pegang</malay> then I was like
no I didn't
I didn't
I didn't hold
but ya
it was painful
but I'm not scared of cuts [lah] but it's just like
subway subway
the place is really toxic the workplace is very toxic
I can don't tell you that it is toxic
wait what did you friend what did your friends didn't say
ya they do
okay it's not like reuse the bread [lah] it's like
the previous day <malay>punya</malay> bread
they will just keep it in the bread (um)
what's that
the place where they store the bread
and then the next day breakfast if people order then we will use that
but but I mean cause we toast it right
we toast it before we serve so
it's
right
I mean
if it's mouldy we will not
sell the bread [lah]
but like for vegetable I can say that (um) cause I cut vegetables right
[ah] you know bell peppers
the top and the bottom actually have to cut it off but then (um) cause they say like sometimes cause (uh) not enough or something
we will cut that too
then we include it in the box in the container then we serve
customer that
the only thing I take is like lettuce and cucumber carrot but cucumber we cut ourselves lettuce no they come in bags vacuum packed
so I guess lettuce is fresh but
and the rest is also fresh [lah] cause
we always get
<malay>macam</malay> boxes of it
every time every time is production day
always we always have to order directly
the vegetables
so I guess it's quite fresh [lah] not bad
(uh) it's a small restaurant thai to go but
[eh] that one right the pay #masyaallah#
<malay>sedap</malay> cause
I mean the thing is right we only take orders serve customer (uh) maybe sometimes wash dishes and then we have to make sure that delivery orders are
like they order through online right so we we have we will get emails about the orders so you have to print the order give to the kitchen and the delivery rider
that's all it's not that it's not that (um)
complicated
why
[orh]
I mean I mess up a lot of times
so
like
but the way they key in the order is cool it's like
all on the computer
you know like how
restaurant key in orders is like there's a kiosk at the front right no it's inside the office
it's not even a kiosk it's a computer
kiosk is the <malay>macam</malay> mcdonald's <malay>tu</malay>
mcdonald's <malay>yang kau</malay> order <malay>kat depan tu abeh dia picit picit yang itu</malay> [ah]
it's not like that
ours is a computer
then the money all okay maybe it's just not a established restaurant [ah] but
it's cool
bro eight dollars per hour and like
the work is not even that stressful I can just sit there and do my shit know
cause so far away
it's at okay it's like now it's (uh) you know #kembangan# station
in front of the <malay>masjid</malay>
but I mean I can text her [oh] I can text her back and be like can I work
(mm)
I think you have to go interview
but I'm
I can go and work
but
(um) there's a straight bus from your house eight five four
I will I will also take eight five four but you have to walk a bit [ah]
<malay>depan</malay>
<malay>depan</malay> (um)
ya
then you take to #kembangan# station then you have to walk to <malay>masjid</malay> then cross
but the restaurant okay the restaurant is okay but <malay>makanan dia sedap</malay>
we get free lunch and dinner if you work that's why I like working there and the pay is way more than like
Subway
is
ya
I should have bargained bro
can like at least seven dollars [lah] [sia]
my back hurts from nothing for six fifty only but then
I guess six fifty is easy money
cause subway
I don't know how it was easy money [ah] cause every month I can get four hundred but they minus for also gang ten percent only
so
but that one is if I work like almost
almost everyday I work [sia]
four hundred
(mm)
if not it's like what one hundred two hundred
(mm)
that one the the (um)
<malay>paling pendek</malay> is
four hours
and that one can get really
thirty six dollars
already
no cause we have quite a lot of admin also
so <malay>nak kerja susah sikit</malay>
I think [ah] I'm not sure how good they they grow or like did they even grow cause right
kind of hard
but
okay <malay>tapi kalau kerja sana</malay> [kan]
this everyone else is guy except for you
that's why it's a little bit scary for me
but they won't do anything
I hope
<malay>asal takut</malay>
I mean
a mouse
you're a mouse
I mean
[oh]
no
then I'm not scared
ya I know
I was scared too
they were adults and when I was working that time I was like seventeen
and then like
bro sometimes they
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [sia]
wait the
okay so got
a few times I work closing so I have to make sure that
I mop everything <malay>sapu</malay>
<malay>sapu</malay> the outside and inside the office also
then the kitchen obviously the cooks will handle it right but then
I already put
the dishes like the customers ate from
at the back
so they have to wash it what but then never then I'm like
what the heck and they went home already and then the kitchen was dark then I was like <malay>takkan nak biarkan ni kat sini nanti</malay>
got rats
will come cockroaches will come
so I went to on the kitchen lights
and wash it and then the <malay>tempat</malay>
<malay>cuci pinggan</malay> is at the back near the back door then the back door
it was like damn dark
outside
cause it was at night like nine and it but my father was outside [ah] cause he was waiting for me he pick me up always

cause it's a small restaurant
then got everywhere
you take money people can see
then we have to ensure the float is like fifty hundred but (um) different cash or whatever then if the kitchen want to buy more eggs or whatever they need to tell me then I give the money then they have to give me the receipt then I have to keep in the float
it's actually not that hard

stupid but I like to handle money

but I don't know where to work
if only they take in
youngsters
okay we are not really youngsters we're like
youth please
youth
I want to work in a library
no one will talk to you
no human interaction
then now <malay>pakai</malay> mask [kan]
shoot daggers
and but if you work
I know
twenty one
cause when you work in library you are under cisco
cisco is a police
and
I don't know I never check
cause library don't really
ask for workers (mm)
you should apply
you want to go
and ask
there and be like can I apply

(mm)
one of my lecturers also like that
like okay cause
ya science
(um)
<malay>punya</malay> course [kan]
so it's more theory based
but the thing is she reads off the slides
in her lecture videos
and it's so annoying cause when she gives us test
or (uh) quizzes
even though it's open book you cannot find it in the notes
so how am I supposed to answer the questions
then later we fail you'll be like
then if she go through
isn't this in the notes
why don't you try reading your notes and referring back to your question and find the answer to your question even if you know the answer already there is no answer in the notes
ya but
do you know the feeling where like after you have done you are done with everything then you read again then you understand

(um) he didn't say why but he told #amin# [eh] he told #syafiq# it's because like he feels that (uh) he's doing all the work and then I I
I am not reciprocating his efforts but I don't think it's it is that

(mm)
portrait the fuck
(mm)
[ah]
(uh huh)
ya
ya
that was ya okay okay so after the the ex right
!aiya! I I give people the benefit of doubt [lah]
so anyway (um) so after the the the the the the cheating case
then he dated this other girl
which was his no which was his ex primary school they bump into each other not they bump [lah] I think
they had a primary school reunion
then they met so that's
that was when
that was this [one] [ah] this [one] I think last year
last year or last two years
I think so
ya
[eh] no no no his relationship was just what eight months
ya
ya so (um) the
ya then he dated this his ex primary school friend ya so
this girl she was the one who ended
with him because this girl is much more religious than him so
this girl you know <malay>macam pergi</malay> date <malay>semua</malay> [kan] he she doesn't even want to be <malay>macam macam sekarang kita tengah lepak dekat macam</malay> playground <malay>gini kita dua</malay> [jer] [kan] let's say you are a guy
she doesn't want that
<malay>macam berdua-duaan abeh lepas tu kalau macam nak pergi</malay>
<malay>tengok wayang</malay> cinema <malay>macam dua orang</malay> even though there's there are other people but
is <malay>tetap macam korang dua orang</malay> [jer] [kan] in a dark place also she she's not comfortable with it so
her mindset and like the ex mindset is that if she likes you and (um)
she wants to tie the knot she's ready to settle down
but this is the thing that I am not sure because
I think she has already said [lah] what her intentions are and what she wants in life
ya which is very good I'm very proud of her to you know to know what you want in life and but
(um)
that's the thing I don't I don't
know why he didn't pursue that
how should I don't know I never ask
how he ya
ya so <malay>dengan dia</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> I think he is ready
ready to settle down I think [lah] almost there [lah] but
but then if he is wait wait if he is ready
like you know as in his mindset
whether he whether he is ready or not
for me I'm not ready I'm sure as hell not ready man I need a few more years
to marry ya
wait wait wait ya so
if if I think he really likes this girl [lah] but then this girl wants to get married
but I don't understand why he cannot pursue that
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> she didn't
when she wanted to break things off
that was her reason [ah]
ya
(uh) I never ask for details
(mm)
you know when they first went out right
he asked for permission from the girl's parents
really [ah] I no one has no one has asked me
at all
[orh] ya
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
[orh] okay
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya but when he did that it wasn't with it wasn't with the Muzmatch girl it was with the primary school girl
ya
[ah]
!oops!

what I feel is that the mothership feels like SGAG kind <malay>tapi</malay> they are more seniors I <malay>tak pasti</malay>
but since you said it's they're government backed like okay
ya
okay that's new something I learn (hmm)

SGAG makes memes
mothership don't
what do you say to that
(mmhmm)
but I hear a but
no but
ya cause you're one sided is
you're one sided you see
I saw some
true
well as compared to my point of view <malay>macam</malay> I follow both SGAG and mothership on their social media so
some
sometimes I do agree with SGAG
so
so

it's
it's making sounds so you know
I don't even know
honestly I don't even know what is singer oil and <malay>apa benda itu</malay> and what is the usage and function of it
ya because my childhood is spent like playing around on land and on sea not doing anything
[oh]
ya
[oh] I know why I <malay>tak tahu ini benda</malay> cause I don't sew and I <malay>tak tahu macam mana nak jahit</malay>
is that that could be the reason [oh] okay
!hais! <malay>mana</malay> [lah] <malay>tahu cakap pasal</malay> childhood did you
grow up most of the time in the west you did right why am I asking again ya it's always been in the west
actually me too
(um) (mmhmm)
serious [ah]
ya
never ever your family or parents wanted to or any
[oh] !wow! !wow! I <malay>tak cakap</malay> #yishun# [seh] I wanted to say to the east or the south
you know what I mean
well now that you what
(uh huh)
when was this
right so <malay>maknanya</malay> you were about primary school
[oh] okay that you were young wait <malay>tapi</malay> please explain to me how you know about this information you were so young

in between #changi# prison [oh] okay <malay>maknanya</malay>
that building that land is is been there for a while [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you know
since you say you were still young
so
does it look old
ish from the outside
!huh!
<malay>dia dah</malay> (um) refurbish and upgrade is it
interesting okay
live
[oh] okay
is it due to cost and expenses
do you want to talk about it is it even sensitive okay
I mean but [oh]
principles so I guess we can break it down to priorities also [lah] like
they are raising you also and they're still
early in their marriage days
(hmm)
you raise me up okay sorry suddenly reminded of that song
I understand
you were saying ya okay priorities [lah] in that sense
like getting a house

(um) when I was in school <malay>macam</malay> doing research on like economists and economic crisis
ya when we're younger there was this thing happening <malay>macam</malay> at that point of time we don't feel it [lah] obviously cause we too young
to experience it <malay>tapi</malay>
ya it's so interesting
but I guess it's a silver lining right like you know the way you guys are now anyway so <malay>macam</malay> more comfortable
I mean everyone has hardships [lah] but
it's like this is a life that's comfortable for you and me and ya
for you sorry not me why why am I in your picture anyway for you

ya do they still find it <malay>macam</malay> alien when you
travel to other parts of singapore <malay>macam</malay> cause you don't know the place well and stuff cause for example like me [kan] <malay>kalau</malay>
I drive up to the east especially for with myself or with myself <malay>pula</malay> on my own
with my parents et cetera <malay>macam</malay> it feels very alien
I <malay>pergi tempat lain gitu</malay> it's not somewhere that I'm comfortable with actually unless <malay>macam</malay>
I have people who go with easties that go with me to that area
what do you think

ask you
!fuh!
when's the last time when's the last time you went
[ah]
<malay>berapa lama</malay> [eh] <malay>kena</malay> book in advance
[oh] so it's like balloting process or like first come first serve
okay
okay
(err) they you know <malay>kasi</malay> chance (uh) to (uh) other people [ah]
cause your name <malay>busuk</malay> already haris bin masli banned
and then <malay>esok tak ada apa-apa teman</malay> me [ah] <malay>pergi tengok</malay> (uh) what's this <malay>kerusi</malay>
[eh] <malay>rasa</malay>
can [ah] try try
you know the APOL chair
ya it's like a new you know there's like Secret Lab then Royale Ergonomics like these chair brands in singapore
then APOL
ya here it quite prominent [ah] and like
they really build up their name [eh] you know like
those DOTA players players right
all the chairs are all sponsored by (uh) Secret Lab
ya
cause aesthetic wise right is up there [ah] pretty nice [lah] you see the thing like very tempted but like functionality wise is like the same [ah] throughout all these brands I would say
pricing <malay>mahal</malay> Secret Lab <malay>paling murah</malay> four nine nine [sia]
[ah]
ya but then like it's like
aesthetic wise I mean but you think about it is like four nine nine right it really makes a difference you compared to using
like a normal chair right now
(mm)
ya
[eh] but this [one] is like high quality leather like they add in all the other I don't want they do [lah] but
they treat the materials quite well so it's like very resistant to all these (uh)
sweat and for you to you know peel and tear like
ya that's why
that's why I'm deciding [eh] I want ask you this would you rather pay like say
(uh) let's say five hundred four nine nine for the the Secret Lab chair
than [eh] APOL is three nine eight
ya
similar <malay>tapi</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> Secret Lab <malay>ada</malay> five years warranty APOL <malay>dua</malay> year [jer]
so I'm now weighing the option whether like a hundred dollars more for extra three years warranty is it worth it or not
(mmhmm)
ya ya
no [ah] it's like covered a few stuff like you know (um) for Secret Lab they have this tear protection thing so where like if the material <malay>kalau terkoyak-koyak</malay> [kan] <malay>kopek-kopek</malay> then after that
ya
ya that is the thing need to ask properly
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(uh) that [one] obvious [sia] the terms and condition specifically say that
if you let's say they found any like (um) forceful kind of you know
what they call it [ah] damage on your behalf then it would be voided [ah]
I
<malay>tapi air tumpah tak</malay> damage <malay>apa</malay> you can just straightaway <malay>lap</malay> the thing then the water is gone already
over time maybe yes [ah]
then that's the part where that tear warranty comes in
(uh huh)
ya kinda it is it is
ya
<malay>tu</malay>
ya <malay>aku nampak</malay> I saw that [one] <malay>basuh</malay> the <malay>lantai</malay> then all the stains all just come out right
that's true [ah] Coke like damn sweet [eh] I I'm not a fan of Coke [ah] it's too sweet for me

[eh] wait seasons
[oh] I think I got I think I never try Seasons (uh) peach tea before [eh]

through you haven't been to club room right ever since
[oh] like as in you just <malay>lepak tak belajar</malay> this kind of stuff
because you got the mindset [lah] like you know there's a
relax corner in school
<malay>potong kaki</malay> [ah]

(uh)
I also finding [ah] I want find like (uh) you know like stable kind of part-time
<malay>tapi</malay> cafe
ya exactly cafe <malay>semua gaji</malay> like they don't pay you that well then at most <malay>kurang-kurang</malay>

ya ya #sheikh# ya okay I tell you about banquet the #sheikh# and this another friend [kan] <malay>dorang kerja</malay> banquet <malay>lepak</malay> [lah] because <malay>dorang dah kerja lama</malay> so they got a lot of seniority
so you know when banquet (uh) how it works like
let's say for event you must set up
the number of tables for events these kind of stuff
so this #sheikh# and the my this friend right step manager <malay>dorang tak buat kerja</malay> just like manage them tell them what to do then <malay>lepak</malay> so basically for like let's say maybe ten hours of work right they only do
<malay>dua dua jam tiga jam</malay>
<malay>tapi dapat gaji</malay> for the whole thing then they just <malay>lepak makan</malay>
so for them that's why they like banquet and they can earn quite a lot
ya ya they all like make friends already [ah] that's why

but then he return vouchers so people like think like [eh] <malay>aku bayar macam gini tapi dapat</malay> voucher so like
then okay <malay>juga apa</malay>

go there quite a few times with his family and all

all the battle royale game but it's a bit more futuristic
and then you get skills or niche
kind of character you choose
it's good no no it's not it's like futuristic it's not cartoon-ish there's a difference you know between cartoon-ish (uh) cartoon-y and future futuristic
it's like what's the valorant
!huh!
okay if you think valorant is not cartoon-y that means apex is definitely not already because apex is like (uh) it's like PUBG but
instead of like you know the buildings then the
or the guns all like a typical gun but it's like more of the halo kind of version
[ah] ya something like that
but it's quite dope [ah]
I plan to but then <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>dulu</malay> need to work [ah] then like don't have much time to play games this [one] now DOTA also I don't really play that much

okay [ah] was short-lived also [ah]
it
it's good good actually I quite surprised the thing (err) like just die down like I thought it will be a continuation but
I think and
say again
ya no it's because the Sony go screw up the
the new series which is the what's that [ah] Vita
[ah] Vita Vita
Vita that that
part of I mean that that series was like the downfall I feel
then just nice came up also then people just I don't know actually I quite surprised why became popular
because of like Pokemon and what
<malay>tapi macam tak</malay> necessary [kan] <malay>dia punya</malay> touch screen and all
I think
(mm) I think the main appeal is just because can support the
(uh) what's Pokemon games people literally buy just to play pokemon games
ya even Switch also Switch initially was like ya that's why
ya
animal crossing also quite is quite new [what] this like this year right ya this year
ya I don't even know why it looks super lame [lah] to me
<malay>macam</malay> minecraft [ah]
but it looks like minecraft is just I don't feel appealed in playing the minecraft kind of games
ya ya why
!huh! serious
how you know
!whoa! sick sick
or is it just to garner the support of like I don't
ya hipster
hipster grand dad
that's why every single move they made it's all got (uh) impact they want to achieve you know
!duh!
(uh) not !duh! [lah] but like possible
fortnite aha bro [eh] you never play fortnite [ah]
[ah] fortnight graphic is cartoon-ish there's that cartoon-ish as heck like damn cartoon-ish

it's like the most pettiest thing
okay I can I think of one
<malay>alasan</malay> that is <malay>paling</malay> like is okay
okay
I can think of one <malay>alasan</malay> that is very <malay>remeh</malay>
and and it's okay
the <malay>alasan</malay> is like is that maybe <malay>dia orang punya suara</malay> is a bit weird like if it's <malay>macam</malay> you know like if you <malay>dengar</malay> like someone speaking and you can know that they're just so annoying
by the way <malay>macam</malay> <malay>entah</malay> [eh] <malay>tak tahu macam mana nak</malay> explain
ya <malay>faham</malay> [kan] ya <malay>tapi</malay> like that's <malay>macam</malay> legit <malay>merepek</malay> [lah]
[kan] [kan] <malay>macam nak sepak</malay> [jer] [kan]

I don't know if got
okay but
ya and some more can <malay>beli</malay> all of their stickers or <malay>baju</malay> and stuff
and usually the #anime# their their plot <malay>macam</malay> very exciting and very fun [lah] cause it's not like real life so there's <malay>banyak</malay>
that you can you can do with the plot
you can <malay>tambah benda merepek</malay> that doesn't make sense or something that isn't <malay>macam</malay> logical in real life

then you will rebound back ya so now I think you are damn traumatised too [oh] my god that was so bad but then like you didn't know
like light snacks
no but like you also have to think like in a in a healthy way
it means maybe he is worried about your health then like for you to get both why you want motor though like I planning to take car like next year why motor
I am not saying why but like I rarely meet my friends or like girls in general that want motor right ya most of them <malay>nak kereta</malay> I mean like ya [oh] sorry I don't know [what] I mean I don't understand like
(mm) like your brother (mm) wait are you an only child !wow!
wait wait he do army malay army quite shocking [ah] cause you know they always #jio# us at
they throw malays everywhere but the army
then he like at least you got there ya so sorry [ah] I quite shocked [ah] but #alhamdulillah# at least he got there I mean <malay>macam</malay> token you got hear that before the token malay like what were we talking about again
of course [lah] but
the thing is I also scared cause did you hear the cases like female in the army like the chances of them getting like harassed sexually harassed like a lot of things [lah] you know last time malaysia had like female army also then they abolish it because event the sergeant all that rape the girls
I mean like that's like the ones that speak out some of them get silent like don't tell but if you go then I wish you all the best hopefully
ya those are like misogynistic people I hate that but like I don't know cause I always thought like I can juggle myself but I hear my friends all that the thing is like when you are at the stage K maybe cause you are strong but
I heard people are not like some other girls cannot take it then like you know you just <malay>risau</malay> then like if talking about the context as a female but like if you are also not gonna say cause you are under a superior <malay>macam tukar macam</malay> sergeant <malay>kau</malay> then <malay>kalau nak buat benda</malay> like he can <malay>macam</malay> threaten you
ya okay I think I agree also but then the thing is I'm not trying to say that we are as women are not strong or what it's just like K we can <malay>macam</malay> move on to the topic of like the whole like sexism misogynistic ideology in singapore like do you do you <malay>nampak</malay> the news <malay>baru keluar</malay> like [ah] this chinese man
<malay>dia</malay> freaking like molest <malay>budak kecil perempuan</malay> and like upskirt and then he just got like seven months probation the thing is <malay>macam kalau nak cakap pasal</malay> sexual cases like harassment <malay>kat</malay> singapore the government just like turns a blind eye towards it like why is the system so whack
no I don't think we is worth comparing like that itself is itself a whole different issue ya like but then and racism is completely different but the situation is like of course [ah] but like black women have it worst
you mean over why you refer like that
but he his child is what he believes what you can handle yeah cute [ah] you you thought like your friend like that
that's
too formal ya I think he also understands the way we (err) the way we speak
how are you gonna disrespect [orh]
I've never seen a muslim like righteous of <malay>para</malay> muslim say that like !alah! but then like <malay>maki</malay> !alah! also like did you see the french people right that was like
ya the thing is like cause french they are trying to reach like circularism <malay>macam dia tak nak apa-apa</malay> religion at all <malay>kat dalam dia orang</malay> country or <malay>tak nak</malay> individualism <malay>kat dalam</malay> country <malay>dia orang</malay> also <malay>dia orang tak nak</malay> [ah] <malay>tudung semua tak nak</malay> which I don't understand because other people from other religion <malay>macam</malay> nuns <malay>tu semua</malay>
because they <malay>tutup</malay> also right I'm not saying they shouldn't also I'm saying like why the double standards <malay>macam kita orang tak boleh dia orang boleh</malay> and then the french the macaron you know the french cookie the president ya <malay>dia kata dia tak suka hijab</malay> cause we look scary
ya like I don't understand (err)
but then like as much as we understand do you see the thing with us is right I'm not saying like I'm not saying we are greater than them but like muslims we endured so much and like we've been we are the most oppressed religion but we understand and respect the fact that they cannot understand our religion but they cannot give us an ounce of respect that just infuriates me a lot [lah] <malay>macam aku boleh</malay> (err) <malay>macam hormat kau punya agama asal kau tak boleh hormat kau tak faham pun</malay> the very least you can do is just give us respect
they don't even no the thing is that they are so ignorant <malay>dia orang tak kesah</malay> but the thing is even if you <malay>tak kesah</malay> or like don't care just leave us alone there's no need [oh] really but the thing is they don't care I think is not they don't care they just hate us for some god damn reason I don't understand why
then like just leave us alone if you don't understand us you know you don't respect us also there's no need to like bash us just leave us alone
ya I think cause of our <malay>agama</malay> also cause you know #nabi muhammad# he say cannot hate anybody and you respect I think a lot <malay>agama</malay> and morales also I just don't understand why why do they hate us but
singapore is so sheltered honestly seeing as to what is happening in like all over the world <malay>kita dalam</malay> bubble and like do you see how many people are like I'm not saying they are dumb but I think we are like so <malay>selesa</malay> and comfortable <malay>dalam</malay> singapore then when you like <malay>tak kesah</malay>
I'm not saying you but like you know some malays like they say the N word and <malay>apa lagi</malay> like just <malay>perangai dia orang</malay> [ah] I'm wanna believe is adolescence but <malay>macam bodoh apa</malay> like <malay>kalau kau tengok balik</malay> they end up what the fuck I'm not supposed to say that
like what was I doing back then you know I don't know the new generation of <malay>mak minah</malay> scares me ya scare me like <malay>dulu dulu</malay> is not this bad like honestly in my opinion like right now even though last time got gang fight or what is like never serious in my opinion [ah] <malay>tapi sekarang macam</malay> I see them like throwing <malay>maki</malay> [ah] <malay>mak kau</malay>
<malay>mak kau</malay> ya is just uncomfortable [lah] to <malay>tengok</malay> like the younger generation
is very <malay>sedih</malay> ya <malay>macam kalau</malay> cause the thing is (um) like the older generation <malay>tak nak pergi</malay> I'm not saying
that we're gonna like you know right when the time comes it comes but then is gonna be our turn to lead and then we <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> the younger generation <malay>aku macam</malay> (err) like you know just sad to see I'm not saying we are all bad
<malay>apa dia buat ni</malay> [ah]
honestly I don't even think you are a <malay>minah</malay> you just look like a normal malay like ya
ya you see the thing is with a lot of muslims nowadays they <malay>fikir</malay> just because then they feel <malay>macam</malay>
judge you and then when they want to say something or like like to say something [ah] is not even <malay>tegur</malay> is like <malay>sindir</malay> like <malay>asal kau</malay> I'm like (um) sorry sally like like you know like <malay>asal kau pakai tertutup asal kau</malay> I'm like (um) I'm trying my best you know like the way they <malay>tegur</malay> is it comes off very like offensive maybe it's just us I don't think I don't think I'm that sensitive
sometimes is the way they say is very hurtful ya (mm)
some people like please please others just because they want something but then I think like there's a difference between like pleasing someone to <malay>jaga hati</malay> or pleasing someone to get them to be your friend on games or something like that that's like very different though but sometimes I think people get mixed up about it
like just because I told you this and then you <malay>ungkitkan balik</malay> I hate it when people do that like when I tell you something and then you just suddenly bring it up again even though I did not mean it in that context <malay>macam apa ni bodoh</malay> like no like like I would say the younger generation that is cause
I mean the older generation I can tolerate a bit [ah] a bit sometimes they a bit too proud [ah] of what they are you don't have to ya they don't have to bring themselves up ya they bring us down to bring themselves up <malay>macam dulu aku kecil-kecil</malay> how [ah] I don't know [lah]
how they say like last time they small young they pray so many times do this do that I'm like why
!wow! congratulations !wow! <malay>masuk jannah esok</malay> but I've met some people that <malay>dia orang</malay> (err) like <malay>hafal al quran</malay> all that until like not say fluent or what I'm not sure that's what they are trying to do but it comes off that way or maybe I <malay>tersinggung sikit sebab</malay> I <malay>tak boleh hafal</malay> but like you know there's no need to
say it out loud if you want to say you know there's a way to say it across without I mean you get it there's a vibe ya then sometimes if if like more than one person say is wrong and this is what we get from you then you still reject it it's obviously not us it's you ya
I come after you [eh] <malay>aku baru habis khatam</malay> [tau] <malay>kau tukar ke tak kau kat masjid mana macam</malay> like !wow! and usually is like not saying what [ah] but is the <malay>madrasah</malay> kids <malay>pun macam gitu</malay> ya and then they
[eh] I don't know <malay>cakap bahasa arab aku macam</malay> okay thanks [oh] my god ya [oh] my god ya is it like sometimes <malay>aku</malay> like just <malay>fikir</malay> and talk about these stuffs
like deep down I will ask myself is it caused by <malay>cemburu</malay> or what but honestly honestly I no you know
but like <malay>macam</malay> it just like <malay>sakit hati</malay> the way they talk to us is like that
I think is is how you act on your jealousy
then then like you don't like skip the drills and then you continue like then you <malay>khatam</malay> like you know there's some people that go to some extend in order to <malay>macam rasa bagus sebab dia yang</malay> not even about <malay>quran</malay> or what like just in life general <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia lari empat</malay> round you you <malay>baru lari dua</malay> round then you just say [oh] I finished eight rounds <malay>macam gitu</malay> you know like the competitiveness and like ya I think is like
how you act on it also <malay>apa dia buat pasal tu dia dia yang</malay> vlogging vlogging <malay>tu</malay> [kan] okay
I don't know how it digress but if you get like license motor you want to get like what type of motor !wow!
I only have one girl friend that <malay>ada lesen motor</malay> and she <malay>bawa</malay> scooter ya <malay>comel bodoh</malay> and is very is the [lah] like I think morgan I'm not very familiar with motor but I think what is that [ah]
okay sorry I didn't know it's <malay>comel</malay> at least you will come to school and like like that but I think like <malay>hujan</malay> a bit difficult though ya (mm) ya but how hard like how I have friends who have like motor the <malay>besar</malay> one just like five K starting price

I can <malay>bawa</malay> already I mean if you is this going to be used against me but in singapore I have friends who <malay>takde lesen</malay> then they just <malay>bawa</malay> motor they just <malay>bawa</malay> as long as you <malay>tak kena tangkap</malay>
I'm not trying to teach you or what but I have friends [lah] like you know they just <malay>bawa takde lesen</malay> as long as you <malay>tak tangkap</malay> is okay <malay>takut</malay> risky

they said hot <malay>sakit berat berat</malay> is it what you say heavier [ah]
I have no idea but [oh]
but you know one brand like <malay>gudang garam</malay> that [one] like gold mine cause I don't know how my friends got it but they like <malay>bawa ke sekolah</malay> and then they spread [ah] ya like I don't know how they supply <malay>dapat</malay> like that day <malay>budak ni bawa tu macam</malay>
you know when they <malay>jual</malay> it then that thing you know then <malay>dia kasi kasi orang</malay> I don't know if they <malay>beli</malay> or what [ah] but I'm just like very curious <malay>macam mana korang dapat ni semua</malay> especially when they are underage and then <malay>beli</malay>
wait you have an island there !wow! that's so cool
which part is that which
which part is that [oh] like you are in the islands [oh] so my family is like my mother side from #jakarta# so ya is the capital (um) ya it's alright yeah it's alright
(mm) I've never been there also
I mean [eh] that's a huge flex [eh] you want to like <malay>minum bandung</malay> I want to drink <malay>bandung</malay> in #bandung# like !wow! I mean if
you had the money like <malay>takde</malay> feeling there [ah] <malay>makan</malay> french fries <malay>kat</malay> singapore
[ah] don't attack me like that ya K but not saying our humour I think we've been bred like that do you see now like the media singapore media so lame
!wow! [oh] ya
but interesting [what] they get to think what we are thinking also I bet they are like listening or just like what the heck is going on wait do we have to transcribe this [oh] do we I don't want [sia]
you want like just keep quiet right and then <malay>tiba-tiba segan takutkan dia orang</malay> why is it quiet [ah]
<malay>kelakar bodoh aku tiba-tiba</malay> like [ah] <malay>budak ni tak nak kasi duit</malay> (mm) (mm) #inshallah#
<malay>kasi</malay> surprised <malay>kasi</malay> us another surprise
I think so ya
<malay>tapi</malay> feel like <malay>banyak</malay> though on the other side <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>budak-budak ni</malay>
I mean who doesn't <malay>duit tu siapa tak nak</malay> though
podcast though like in singapore is very like the podcast that are available in singapore is very niche <malay>semua nak buat</malay> like <malay>orang cina-cina</malay> you know like the youtubers <malay>siapa ni</malay> I don't watch them but I think they have podcast and is so like damn I feel [lah] in singapore when I look at podcast I have never seen or I haven't come across
broadcast <malay>melayu</malay> like in english but then by malay people
like not about religion because most of the podcast I see if it's singaporean right there's like religion aspect to it maybe if you want to start then you start [ah] then you have that you occupy that spot but I don't know (err) malay podcast usually talk about <malay>agama</malay> like a lot of it
no
sometimes malaysian humour confuses me (mm) (mm) on spotify have [ah]
cool (uh) I mean that's good also they are trying to
I <malay>pusing</malay> so no [lah] [eh] I only ever seen like those ya but that [one] is like <malay>tiga puluh sen</malay> like you can buy it at the convenient store ya ya ya that [one] you pass around your friends
lighter <malay>kau ada</malay> lighter <malay>tak</malay> lighter <malay>aku dah habis</malay> ya that's the thing I hear a lot also
or you can start like refillable refillable lighter start a business !wow! look at us planning business ya I mean go for it
no like again with the race I'm not trying to pull the race card all the time when I'm talking but like I don't know I just <malay>tak nampak banyak orang melayu yang mungkin aku tak baca berita harian ke apa tapi</malay> I feel like all the
newspaper propaganda so I don't even bother looking at it but <malay>aku tak dengar banyak macam</malay> success story for <malay>melayu</malay> that's like !wow! you know
(mm) I think the latest entrepreneurial I heard about is like this chinese couple they start like a pet grooming service ya <malay>untuk anjing</malay> [ah] I mean that's for them [ah] that's a niche for them but like <malay>aku tak dengar pasal melayu pun asal kita punya</malay> community <malay>diam</malay> [jer]
[kan] [kan] <malay>aku rasa dia orang dengar macam bosan</malay> though
no I think like when we send it to them then <malay>dia orang akan dengar</malay> and I think cause cause the video they show <malay>dalam</malay> form like changing changing the code switching that [one] I think they <malay>akan belajar</malay> to like analyse the way we <malay>cakap</malay>
interesting [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I think this is something only bilingual people do I mean no shit [lah] how can one person with only one language do it what you know but then I've never heard of a chinese person speak in chinese in mandarin and english like <malay>campur</malay> is usually one one like ya around me [lah] is like very rare and like
most of my chinese friends don't even speak mandarin cause they hate mandarin I don't know why ya some of them hate the <malay>bahasa ibunda</malay> I'm like bro
I think as long as you can hold a conversation is okay
ya <malay>betul betul</malay>
how how no like cause like I've been to K everybody been to stations but like like most of them they are like chinese
aunties or what will come up to me and ask me how to get to a place in mandarin K like I understand a bit only but after that <malay>aku tak faham kau nak aku buat apa</malay> I get so like at first confused but then like cause before I wore <malay>hijab</malay>
I I look like a chinese like ya I don't like it cause one time I got offered #bak kwa# before I'm like <malay>我是马来人:wo shi ma lai ren</malay> no #bak kwa# for me no oink oink for me sweetie
like then they get so aggressive I'm not I'm not hating or anything but they are so ya and like ya and like you know on also during sitting down they will like stare you down I've never seen a malay aunty stare you down for a seat
but like the (err) chinese aunties they will like literally like look at you for you to stand up ya ya then I'm like I'm like no no especially if <malay>kalau tu bukan apa ni</malay> reserve seat why the why should I ya you know is not entitlement right ya of course
(um) I won't go as far as full responsibility maybe just a bit ya

<malay>kau pergi</malay> vivo <malay>nanti dengan aku</malay>

and you will be comforted
like anyway <malay>pasal buku aku yang aku cakap tadi tu</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> !hey! <malay>bukan yang buku tu aku cakap buku aku sendiri setan</malay>
I'm telling you that I wanted to buy
no it's not lit it's just a book that I read for fun two years ago
you know what that story is about so that story is about actually when I read it two years ago I wasn't a lit student so I didn't really quite understand what it was about but now
I'm trying to reread it again and try to know but back then my point of view for that book and main whole story plot
is that at first <malay>ada satu lelaki ni lelaki ni</malay> something happen to him there's something wrong with him I can't remember what's wrong because it was two years ago when I read it
<malay>tapi sebab dia ada</malay> accident
a few years ago or a couple months ago he suddenly refuse to talk he can talk but he refuse to talk and he say he cannot talk like he's in denial that he can talk so he just writes like anything he says wants to say or like anything he just writes it down
then he met this girl <malay>rambut dia</malay> is like silver <malay>rambut dia</malay> silver <malay>lepas tu dia cantik gila</malay> according to the description
he didn't fell in love at first
he saw the girl and he saw the girl <malay>punya</malay> purse <malay>dalam tu ada</malay> like <malay>berjuta-juta</malay> cash so being like a poor ass human being he stole his her purse he stole then he tried to walk away from her hotel but then he felt bad then he came back and he wanted to take his notebook
and then eventually like they got closer and closer it's like <malay>macam</malay> your basic korean story although it's not korean then after that (um) they did what they had to do and this guy that guy was trying to help the girl from suicide
and then like they help through each other [ah] but eventually the girl committed suicide by jumping off the bridge that's why the cover is the golden bridge
you look at the back you can see the girl at the back
at the back of the book
ya just flip it over you can see the girl
and it's !oi! <malay>jangan buat bising</malay> [lah]
!oi! it's at the back it's at the back page of the book just find it that or is it in front [oh] okay I'm sorry I can't remember

if you ever do have a like your own house what type of interior do you want or like what type of vibes do want to get from your house
you know girl
why
no is it
what
ya why
<malay>mana</malay> you need to <malay>pandai cari</malay> [lah] you cannot obviously find those <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>apa tu yang</malay> what do you call that
you cannot you cannot go to a like a shop itself <malay>kalau</malay> shop <malay>tu ada</malay> brand it's definitely going to be expensive you need to buy something <malay>yang tak ada</malay> brand <malay>sebab</malay> okay if I tell you (um) chanel
a bag from chanel or a <malay>baju</malay> from chanel and a <malay>baju</malay> from H&M but it's the same exact <malay>baju</malay> it's the same exact colour however will there be a difference in price
exactly it's because of the branding
so you need to find if you want to live a minimalist life
then you need find different sources you cannot just go to like a specific shop
well that's the irony there then

and then he like the circle carpet outside if you have saw it and then he also <malay>suka bilik mak aku</malay>

<malay>bilik mak aku</malay> [a'ah] <malay>dia dah</malay> romantic mood

I want blackout curtains so when you close the curtains you cannot see any light at all
you bet I'm going to sleep the whole day girl
<malay>asal</malay>
[ah] <malay>sebab kau</malay> [kan] vampire
<malay>tingkap pun tak nak buka</malay>
<malay>asal kau tak nak buka tingkap</malay>
so your house is like just <malay>dua tingkat</malay> you know you look at my cat
no but then if you open the <malay>tingkap</malay> near your <malay>bilik</malay> it wouldn't be a problem right near your room
why you
how can you live without like fresh air
you have lost your mind
<malay>tapi</malay> our air freshener that right there is like an ioniser
<malay>tu</malay> the white colour thing the ioniser it it basically right it helps you remove all the bad and harmful <malay>macam</malay> bacterias in the air and then <malay>keluarkan</malay> the cool air
I cannot understand <malay>punya</malay> fame you know I realise something weird about me I like like groups that are not famous
like last time before was famous like this famous
like back in twenty seventeen they were not famous but they do exist
[oh] wasn't that when dope was released
ya I like I like baby #jungkook# now he's so !aww!
he has like !wow! I know him <malay>badan dia</malay> like okay it's just something I would like to have you know asal ada benda yang memekak luar kat situ</malay>
would you live in a maisonette or a condo
!oi!
why
why not
I'm not saying maisonette is like <malay>atas bawah</malay> [tau] <malay>rumah dia macam rumah shafiq tu</malay>
or condo
why you don't
one why
why then we might as well live with your parents
I mean if you want if you want to have your own house isn't it <malay>macam</malay> you want your own space
why [oh] because you just live in your room [eh] <malay>sekarang</malay> <malay>dah terbiasa gitu</malay> [lah] [oh] okay okay <malay>faham faham</malay>
so [ah] <malay>rumah aku ni sebenarnya banyak buku tapi buku-buku ni semua dia untuk perhiasan aku tak baca pun</malay>
(uh huh) <malay>atuk aku ada kasih aku buku bila aku</malay> P three
<malay>cerita dia pasal kampung</malay> girl [a'ah] <malay>dia sebenarnya nak kena kahwin dengan siapa</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay>
and then it got really complicated <malay>aku tak pernah habis baca sebab</malay> I find the character so cringey
and it's like <malay>macam</malay> about love and I'm like awkward reading a love story
but <malay>aku rasa kalau aku kasih ulfa</malay> she would like it I guess
[ah] about <malay>apa</malay> don't get me you know I feel like she has very high standards
like she's very sheltered in a sense can you get what I mean
<malay>macam</malay> even the like okay so that day I ask her like
I don't know what I ask her [ah] and after that she suddenly said like her mum [ah] did get all As for like her O levels
then I'm like [oh] then why why is she not working because I legit ask [ah] out of curiosity like I wasn't asking in like a way to downgrade her mum then after that she said [ah]
what [ah] to <malay>jaga</malay> her <malay>atuk</malay> and <malay>nenek</malay> and then she said that her mother is currently working for jems I don't know but I think got out something
then I feel like I don't know for some reason I feel like she has a very #atas# lifestyle
I mean that also I travel almost every year
I mean the places that she travel is not like places of my interest so I don't really care about that
but she has like pass pass pass
and maybe because of that right because of how she have the that type of lifestyle [kan] it does affect her in the way she thinks
she thinks it's like everything is easy to get and like if this way doesn't work out for her right
then she will get like super sad about it
like that time <malay>ada</malay> thing but then in the end she managed to go also [pe]
ya [lah] <malay>ngok</malay>
ya
ya
I mean
why
<malay>apa dia</malay>
serious [ah] <malay>asal</malay>
[ah] <malay>selalu gitu</malay> [oh] my god girl you want me to get started on christina and #ulfa# [eh] no <malay>salah nama</malay> christina and #insha#
so you don't know #insha# and christina are both captains for the netball team right although I have already get out from the school and like shit they are still like one year younger than me right
so what happened is that they are keys team both are them <malay>ada</malay> boyfriend [kan] however the thing with #insha# is that she's for always with her boyfriend like twenty four hours with her boyfriend
so it's so weird <malay>sebab macam</malay> it goes to the extent that the netball cage key the cage key that the captain have to hold is with her boyfriend
in terms of responsibility right if I was still in the team [lah] I would have like shouted at her but then [oh] my god just thinking of it frustrated the shit out of me
and like <malay>macam</malay> okay so you're not do you follow them on instagram okay but anyway but if you do then they actually like <malay>macam</malay> you know how like friends and celebrity couple sometimes they get in a bad condition or situation they always like put up this act or show that's what okay #insha# did to christina so on like
on like they went out and then they went out then they were like okay already then I'm like okay cool then after that the next day on #insha# story there was like this tiktok it was like a repost of someone's tiktok then [ah]
she she said that <malay>macam kalau</malay> in terms of <malay>apa</malay>
like goals that things I want to do with my best friend and one of it was like get married then after that double stuff like that
and then I was like are you guys best friend I texted christina <malay>tapi</malay> ya that's not how it is
<malay>dan dan hari tu dia orang keluar</malay> together they did a double date <malay>lepas tu azhari</malay> didn't have money like I don't know I don't know why #azhari# didn't pay for it but then #akif# paid for it like christina <malay>punya</malay> boyfriend he paid for <malay>insha punya</malay> cable car ride
and it just doesn't make sense to me because why would you have a boyfriend if your boyfriend can't even pay for you girl and like girl why would you go on a date without money girl you okay it's just three dollars
<malay>sot tak sot</malay> [sia]
[oh] so annoying okay end of ranting session <malay>aku nak jadi macam</malay> zookeeper

ten september
it's calling us
[oh] my god
wait what's my last trip
#bangkok#
is it #bangkok#
I think it's #bangkok#
okay toodles

okay so there other day right I was recently I've been watching a lot of
the VTuber [oh] my goodness I'm going to like combust you know like because normally sometimes they have like the mic right like the really good quality one so this guy he bought the I think it's called a binaural mic the for the basically you can hear like left and right right
[oh] my goodness then he was like (uh) then he was like whispering inside the ear and then I was listening it listening to it before I went to sleep and then I was like falling asleep already then after that he shifted the mic
he put it he put it to his chest so you can like hear his heartbeat very clearly and then after that he started whispering and this is damn cringe but I thought to myself !wah! is this what it's like to lie down on someone's chest while they're sleeping [oh] my god that's the dream it's so good then he revealed
he spent about
he said he spent I think twelve K on the mic
then after that when he said that he spent twelve K on the mic everybody started sending him money
like I just want to be a VTuber so people can send me money like they were pulling
this other guy he was pulling (uh) #gacha# for the Apex game
and then the moment he sent it someone sent him like two hundred dollars
and I'm like
dude
like I want to earn #gacha# so I can just earn back everything and pull more #gacha#
then another one they
he what [ah] he cause he didn't turn on super chats for his streams like ever since he debuted I think but then he decided to turn them on for this one stream and I think he earned about one point seven million yen
like in that one stream because <malay>kirakan</malay> everyone <malay>dapat lepas geram</malay> [ah] that kind of thing so finally can get to give him money and people will send him like five hundred dollars at the time I was like damn these people got money I also want [sia] I haven't sent my first super chat but I want to send to someone I'm planning to do it when someone is doing then I can be like thank you for your service thank you very much
that's the dream job though
super chat is the
is the way to send money through if on a youtube live stream so like you can send different amounts so there's like five dollars ten dollars it's up to maybe like five hundred dollars I think
and then you can send a message and the more the higher the super chat amount the longer your message is pinned on like the comment board so they can read it that kind of thing
it's like it's damn cool but then
is the
this girl also she she debuted like I think a month back her avatar is very cute she's like a shark girl she's super cute with the tail and all that she debuted like less than two months ago then she already hit like a million subscribers everyone was just throwing money at her it's insane dude and these people never even don't even need to show their face they just sit there act cute on camera play game <malay>tu</malay> [jer] easy game <malay>dapat duit</malay>
it's just that's the dream job jobs I don't want to work
I really don't want to work
it's insane
all they have to do is sit there and be pretty
ya then like
it's like but I guess especially for streamers right from what I see I guess it's not that easy especially because of like the drama that I told you about just now
I and the fact that they have to stream every day I guess it's hard to differentiate yourself in such a saturated market [lah] that's the thing
there's one guy who streams at least two hours everyday he's the one who spent like one point five K on #gacha# the other day just because he really liked the voice actor
then he spent I think he spent another
a few hundred dollars [lah] at least the other day to get the cute girl the one that I showed you yesterday with the really cute running cycle
so everybody was like okay just wait until the next character banner comes up which I think will be #zhong li# that's why <malay>tu aku pun nak</malay> [sia] he's so hot I cannot I really cannot
he's so hot like
(um) what [ah]
(uh) I was gonna say something but I forgot
(uh) [oh] then yesterday I was watching another one of his streams it was it was the funniest like games stream that I've ever watched because so there's this girl her name is #chihiro yuki# but basically she's her main character is like (uh) this magic girl and then but sometimes she she uses like a deeper voice <malay>kirakan macam jadi lelaki</malay> [lah] that kind of thing so (uh) then she was streaming Apex with that voice and then suddenly these two guys two of her friends join in then they like want to play along then <malay>dorang pun buat suara merepek gitu</malay> then they were like [oh] I want to do this then they were like shit they were saying it in the in the like manly voice and then suddenly they go back [oh] I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that it's damn funny but if they stream didn't last for that long long [lah] but
it was damn cute I want to see them play together they they're competing I think they were training for like this thing called the cup so basically it's like (uh) an Apex Legends tournament
these help it's organised by like this other VTuber this other streamer who's like really good at Apex so there are a lot of people from like VTubers or just pro gamers in general they can join the cup and then I think this time round they actually got prize money they like fifty thousand yen or something like that
it's quite a lot
fifty thousand fifty thousand I think
no (uh) fifty thousand yen in is
okay [lah] six hundred fifty dollars I thought it would be more but this I think this the first time that they are having
prize money [lah] but it's quite interesting to watch
it's
the the last one was quite interesting because
there's this VTuber whose avatar is literally just a gorilla he's just cause his his username is just V gorilla virtual gorilla which is quite interesting like you actually like when you listen to his voice and then you look at the avatar it's like !huh! that makes sense it's not surprising but he's like really good at Apex a lot of these people are like the top five hundred
I cannot [sia] is so scary
I I thought you meant in real life as in like he tried he like hit you with your or something like that
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>faham</malay> that situation that was me when I was playing when I started playing #zelda# I was like so <malay>kecoh</malay> you know I'm like <malay>aku macam budak bodoh</malay> [sia] <malay>aku aku nak nak simpan dia nya apa tu</malay> I wanted to like stop I would accidentally press the arrow button like to to aim the bow and arrow then after that <malay>bila aku nak aku nak</malay> cancel [kan] <malay>aku lupa nak</malay> cancel then instead I press the left side <malay>dia nya</malay> down button and then that's how you activate the whistle right then after that instead I start attracting all the monsters in the middle of the night <malay>macam budak bodoh</malay> [sia] I died so many times while playing that
hand eye coordination skills for games is good because I I started playing games when I was pretty young cause you know my brother right
<malay>lagipun</malay> you <malay>main</malay> you like now you play is it PUBG or is it COD
my I know my class ratio was also quite whack we only had like
I think that ratio was similar to yours we only had ten guys eleven guys I think it's common for schools of like anderson and yes that level then the
I never really started playing games a lot until I got until I got the Switch actually
because before that okay [lah] my parents raised me to be a bit of a nerd [lah] I mean I'm not surprised I mean look at them right this guy reads
the theory of relativity for fun like this guy then I remembered the one thing I used to play a lot I had the Wii Fit then <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>duduk itu dengan apa tu dia nya itu</malay> like the the white <malay>punya</malay> platform <malay>itu</malay> then I look at the thing then I'm like [eh] <malay>aku berat</malay> [ah] [sia] then after that I was like okay whatever moving on but that was quite fun then but I did have the
what's it called
that was damn good though it's like now you think about it right the was basically a Switch
that's why it's like the was so ahead of its time I love playing with the I don't know mine was pink and I only had like one game on there and it was Taken
the is like quite similar it's basically like your Switch Lite right
it's basically the same then what [ah]
(uh) shit what's that other game called Mortal Kombat is it the one with the this like this blue ice guy who's like do you know who
I like that guy I used to have this phase where I just really like watching their like what is it called their finishing moves that [one] !wah! that [one] is quite cool I really like the whole concept of like coming up with each characters like
like finishing moves or like their character design that's what I really like watching looking at when I play games
(uh) I don't know [ah] I don't remember her name but I went to her house cause my <malay>mak nak pergi masjid</malay> so she had to drop me off there [ah] then she was then [oh] my cousin like she was playing Mortal Kombat on the then you know at the ripe at the really young age of four then like she was playing it and I saw it and I saw someone's spine get ripped out of their body and then (um) ya it kinda traumatised me I couldn't sleep that night cause I was always looking at the door I was scared that someone would come in and then rip my spine out ya so that's
I I remember watching I remember watching one of those the ones where like they just yank your intestines out
but
I I have to admit I really like the character design even regarding final fantasy right there's that one guy I think his name is cloud is he from final fantasy
I like I like playing him on Smash because [eh] he quite handsome and his power quite cool
[ah] I want to get good at Smash though
I really want to get good at Smash but it's so difficult like I was watching okay not to bringing the conversation back to VTubers but like they often sometimes the livers like to play with their audience right so they put like the room password and all that on the screen then one there's one notorious guy known as he's not a streamer he's a a viewer also this one guy whose username is pornhub then he always plays as donkey #kong# and he has never failed to turn up with every single [eh] this company [lah] this company at least every single livers livestream if they are playing smash with the viewers and he always beats the shit out of that liver [ah] I don't think I think to this day
nobody has ever beaten pornhub donkey #kong# in in smash if they play with viewers that's the someone has gotten very close it's the guy who spent on point five K on #gacha# he's he got very close to beating him but I think in the end the donkey #kong's# the one that's quite that's like a interesting piece of lore from youtubers but that's quite cool
like I would like to have the title [oh] I beat this VTuber in Smash once I want to play Tetris but they never play Tetris anymore like they used to they used to play Tetris a lot but now now that I'm good at Tetris nobody plays it anymore I cannot flex my skills
it's my one secret talent Tetris but haven't played in quiet a while though
it's quite long right
[oh] serious [ah] <malay>dia orang belum</malay> like you <malay>beli kat mana</malay> Shopee
I think you try <malay>dahulu kalau dia orang tak</malay> reply <malay>baru</malay> send email
serious <malay>masih belum</malay>
it's <malay>kat</malay> Carousell or what
[ah] (uh) did they give you like a batch number or something like that
then maybe you should ask them about that [lah]
it's it's been that's really long it's not a signed on right
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya I remember now I remember now
I haven't bought an album in so long
BTOB !huh! BTOB can they okay to be fair I guess half of the band half of the band is still in the army but the first thing I think I showed you right the first thing like #changsub# and #eunkwang# just got like (uh) they just got released right recently then the first thing they do is go act stupid or some national television show where some matching gold and silver outfit with the X on <malay>bodoh</malay> it's like if I don't know if you know but they did something similar like a long time ago
<malay>dia orang pakai macam apa tu yang</malay>
it's it's like those body tight suits then #changsub# <malay>pakai yang</malay> gold then #eunkwang# <malay>pakai</malay> yang silver or some or it was the other way around it was like skin tight you know it's the kind <malay>cuma muka dia orang</malay> [jer] <malay>boleh nampak</malay> and then they go on national television you know and then they go sing some stupid trot song then they come out of the army okay [lah] admittedly now is a bit more classy <malay>dia orang pakai macam</malay> like black they like the black business pants black business shirt that kind but doesn't take away from the fact that they are doing something so <malay>bodoh</malay> but okay [lah] I miss them I'm glad they're back those two are probably my favourite members
but I heard that one thing that was quite scary before #changsub# enlisted was I heard that
something
he has something to do with his vocal chords like it was like
either getting quite damaged or basically it it was like threatening his the ability to sing [ah] so that was quite okay I can't remember the details but ya that was quite scary they said
he was straining it too much or something like that
so now I'm but I'm so I'm glad that in wait in the army got to rest I'm glad that he he and key got to enlist together that [one] was damn funny the video with the band members <malay>dia orang tengah buat hal kat belakang tu</malay> [kan] <malay>tu merepek</malay> [sia] but at least at least it's good to see that they're having fun in this
<malay>tapi dia orang punya army macam best</malay> [jer]
I know they often I don't know if it's an army thing or what but they have like musicals inside the army is it
right
like the concert I remember #eunkwang# was inside [one] like <malay>dia orang masuk</malay> army <malay>buat</malay> <malay>ke [pe] ke dia orang tengah buat</malay> some musical school or what [sia] I don't get it <malay>dia orang ada</malay> military band [lah] <malay>buat</malay> performance <malay>sini</malay> performance <malay>sana dia orang buat</malay> parade <malay>abeh tu kita kat singapura dia orang macam nak mati</malay> [sia]
you
like
discharged
!huh! serious
I feel like april some should have gotten though I was talking to my secondary school friend the other day then then his was he had to enlist in april <malay>tapi dia dah dapat</malay>
I'm <malay>aku aku pun tak tahu</malay> [sia] I have one friend who cause <malay>dorang ada</malay> I cannot I don't
#alhamdulillah# I don't know if it's the right
term but
he got an offer to join like <malay>dia orangnya</malay> commando training or something like that it's like <malay>macam</malay>
I feel like elite is too is too strong of a word but <malay>macam lebih dia orangnya</malay> fitness level is a bit higher than the rest
then
I was like how do they even figure that out
you know you know what I mean your NAPFA is one thing [lah] but
<malay>seram</malay> [sia] then he then they said that [oh] they will learn
like the more intense stuff like
like diving I don't know I don't know to be honest but it was quite scary but I think he rejected it in the end because it was like nah bro I don't want to become a slave to the army
[oh]
[oh] serious
(mmhmm)
I can I I remember but I cannot remember #ashraf#
I think infantry is like the main
<malay>kirakan</malay> body of the army isn't it or is that weapons infantry
the only knowledge I have about singaporean national service is [ah] boys to men that's it that's the only that's the only thing that I know
but that was the whole thing like singapore is
one of the is it I don't know if there are more countries in the world that make it that make conscription is that the word
they're like
okay anyway the the the fact that they have to go to army enlist
if it's I wonder if they're more countries that make it
the law that they have to or more countries that don't it's probably more countries that don't right I only know korea is necessary singapore necessary
I don't know what malaysia is it necessary
<malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [kan]
[ah] I remember I remember the whole fiasco everybody was like [oh] my god what happens if they need to enlist like guys chill it's their it's the law they need this is bigger than you guys #weh# <malay>tapi seram</malay> [seh] the fact that they have to draw lots I feel like that's scarier I rather just everyone enlist like that
there has to be a better way to do it rather than drawing lots it really felt like [oh] <malay>dia orang dah tak boleh kesah korang nak macam mana nak buat macam ini</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> [pe] [lah] aku tak kesah</malay> [ah] pick lots [jer] [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> [jer]
<malay>gitu</malay> [jer] really that's the <malay>gitu</malay> [jer] the effort
but it's <malay>seram</malay> [sia]
I know I think it was
was it japan they said
that they don't have like their army in the army they don't it's not like they train physical they train physically [lah] but they do a lot of other shit like
what meditate or stuff like that it's like it's basic army is basically like therapy for them it's interesting but like what happens
like
I wonder what would turn out better you know people who are forced to be inside there or people who like
they and you enlist but then again your training is not necessarily
as bad you know
it's so scary to think about though
kamikaze
ya that's the one they like stab themselves in the stomach right or slit open their stomach like that
lose
but then again I guess death
being a prisoner of war
not very two bright sides you know it seems like a lose lose situation here so
probably not
screws over your whole body
!huh!
heartbreak
[oh]
I don't like watching war movies just because I really cannot like you know you know me right I cannot watch anything with too much emotion I'm a very mellow person the most
intense war like thing I probably watched was the
(uh) what's the one that the Ghibli [one]
[ah] <malay>itu itu itu itu itu</malay> that was probably the most war like thing I've watched but
and it's <malay>budak kecil lagi</malay>
the part when <malay>dia apa itu dia kasi batu</malay> [eh] <malay>batu</malay> then <malay>dia ingat</malay> it's <malay>gula</malay> or something like that
I cannot that part was like that that that shit really hurt I really cannot
it's so scary to think that world war two
was not even that long ago
it's
it's not even not even hundred years not even a hundred years right
like that's so recent that's damn scary
my <malay>nenek</malay> was I remember she I cannot remember if she told me the story or my mum told me the story
<malay>dia kata bila</malay>
<malay>dia orang tengah</malay> I think they were like searching the houses or something like that then
<malay>dia nya mak bapa</malay> they put her and her siblings
<malay>kat dalam</malay>
<malay>apa itu</malay>
rice sack then <malay>letak kat dalam</malay> drain then two of them the siblings they put they hide the siblings inside the rice sack cause <malay>dia orang masih kecil</malay> [kan] then <malay>dia orang letak kat dalam</malay> drain <malay>dia orang</malay> cover then after that they ran away I don't know what happened after that I didn't really ask I kinda wanna know but I don't really want to ask cause
ya that shit they can't that can't be not traumatic right so I didn't really want to bring it up again but it was like
damn scary imagining imagine that you have to hide for your life like that
<malay>lagipun masih kecil</malay> [sia] it's
damn scary
serious [ah]
#bestnya#
<malay>dia orang naik sampan</malay> serious
that's that's that's terrifying that's real terrifying [oh] my god
when was that before the after war
#suay#
you'd be <malay>budak</malay> indonesia now !wow!
!wah! that's damn scary though wasn't there the controversy recently about like
how
[ah] okay I don't know if controversy is the right word but people were quite angry at how the japanese pretend like they never did anything bad ever
ya
#hiroshima#
karma
it's the one that resulted in <malay>yang dia orangnya</malay> nuclear meltdown [kan] is it
!wah! I remember watching a documentary about the what went down at the nuclear plant like they were
interviewing cause it's quite rural right so then they were interviewing the people who were living in that village
and then they were talking about how [oh] all are the kids were
they interviewed like the schoolchildren and all that
like the people who were still kids at that point and like the school teachers and all that then I think some of them even though they were like quite far from the thing
they
got exposed to like all the radiation and all that then a lot of them like they didn't not that they passed away instantly but they passed on like a few years after that then it was so scary the way they talked about it so like
you can feel that they are still like very scared of that area then they showed the village what it was like and like a lot of the they showed like the fruits and like the plants and all that it's
<malay>cacat</malay> isn't the right word because it looks very pretty but it seems like it's all deformed and like
correct correct it's like what you see in like sci-fi movies <malay>gitu</malay> <malay>seram</malay> #siot# I wonder if they rebuilt it
the nuclear plant
!huh!
wait that's both very scary and very sad at the same time cause I know they they believe quite strongly in what religion do they follow [ah]
it's not it's like a subset of buddhism is it
spin off
sorry I laughed just now because you know I sent the message to my parents to tell them to enter the house quietly
I misspelled house as horse and then my dad said there's a horse
<malay>merepek</malay> [sia] this guy
but I do but I guess that's the one thing about japan [ah] <malay>dia orang</malay> they're very secular
that's the thing right but like how to say
even if you're different at least they're nice about it that kind of thing I remember last time I went to
new zealand <malay>aku pakai hijab</malay> [kan] then <malay>bila kita masuk</malay> okay [lah] granted this was quite a long time ago
<malay>kita</malay> me and my mum my dad cause me and my mum <malay>dua-dua pakai tudung</malay> [kan] <malay>kita masuk</malay> cafe <malay>dia orang tengok kita macam kat</malay> zoo [sia] <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
like bro chill I'm ten like don't okay I wasn't ten but like like like don't need to stare so hard you know but then when <malay>bila kita kita pergi</malay> japan all that they were much more polite about it even if they didn't like it they didn't say it outright
irritating
it's just
like damn dude all the stares [what] you will literally like stare like nobody's business
[oh] speaking of the like tsunami and earthquake right wasn't there that one really big earthquake or tsunami in
indonesian #aceh# is it
I know it was really big but I don't
do you remember like any news about it I cannot okay given that we were one [lah]
that's true
belongings anymore you can't retrieve like old photo books so it's kind of like everything your whole life just got washed away like that ya and at that time I think a lot people at the beach also so ya [lah] it was quite #suay# that it happened and I don't think it just affected #aceh# it affected some parts of malaysia also ya ya then <malay>kat situ pun ada macam satu</malay> family <malay>dia orang pun dia orang tengah main-main kat</malay> beach then <malay>dia nya anak pergi lari</malay> near the coastline ya then
!huh! serious [ah]
<malay>seram</malay> [pe]
that's true ya the pros are pretty big considering that we have like protection from natural disasters singapore like singapore is a pretty safe country I would say like the fact that I can leave the house with the windows open and come back with everything still intact I think that's pretty impressive within itself like I saw the news <malay>dia orang</malay> [kan] like <malay>ada orang</malay> malaysia <malay>tinggal kat singapura</malay> since the borders <malay>dah tutup</malay> [kan]
then they said like
(uh) when they is the causeway open already
limited is it like <malay>orang</malay> like <malay>pekerja</malay> so like I think either they went back or the police found out or the neighbours <malay>ke</malay> [pe] he found and he had the house they had the house had been broken into then apparently the thieves the
ya the thieves they stayed in the house
right
right it's so gross [kan] like can you imagine you come you cannot go back to your own country because of COVID and after that when you go back all your stuff <malay>dah hilang</malay> then <malay>ada orang tidur kat dalam katil kau</malay> !ee! <malay>seram</malay> [sia] I cannot it's gross it's so gross
(ugh)
(ugh)
it's basically parasite
less gruesome sense
but the fact that they have to resort to that is quite sad as in like the homeless people in america the homeless crisis is so bad like I was watching
a documentary about it the other day
like there are so many
homeless people and because inevitably all these people like fall end up falling sick right and then (uh) for all the people apparently
for all the homeless people in like los angeles or that part of los angeles cause itself is <malay>besar gila</malay> [kan] there's only two doctors who are offering who will go around giving out free healthcare free check ups for these people like can you imagine the first the the fact that firstly there's so many homeless people is already like so telling of <malay>korangya</malay> government but then the fact that so many doctors like come on obviously there has to be a lot of doctors right in america the fact that only that <malay>cuma orang dua orang</malay> [jer] are willing to give out free treatment for these homeless people like they seriously what do you lose from it you know like where's your basic sense of humanity if you've got you've got the knowledge and skills <malay>korang</malay> just check up <malay>sikit pun boleh</malay> [pe] the fact that only two people regularly do it
it's so insane I cannot stand america <malay>dia orang nak</malay> vote <malay>pun buat hal</malay>
it's insane I cannot it's a gross country
I cannot [eh] my first amendment my right to own a gun like it's gross dude I almost swore I don't know if I'm allowed to swear but
it's gross [sia] then now also I just really hope really really really I pray to god <malay>ya allah</malay> please forgive me for all my sins just just make sure donald trump <malay>tak menang</malay> serious I if people if
people are still <malay>dia orang nak tulis apa tu</malay> cause you can write in to you can even if your candidate name is not there right you can write in the name of someone which is a bit <malay>bodoh</malay> [ah] honestly like what's the point a lot of people <malay>dia orang tulis nama</malay> kanye west [tau] because he was he's been joking about it no it to us he feels like he's joking but to him it's like he's it's real right he's been talking about [oh] vote me in for president president guys then I'm like
<malay>asal kau nak buat macam ini ya allah</malay> serious why it's so <malay>bodoh</malay> I cannot and the fact that
I don't know [lah] it's just okay [lah] granted they have a their population is what three times
five whatever [lah] it's huge right and like I get that elections are much more big
the one again one of the pros of living in singapore
okay apart from the super super what do you call it
super majority
if anything but at least now things are changing but I just hope they don't lower the voting age
countries like america
that's the thing you see like okay not okay I might sound a bit like a boomer like but
it's like I was a bit scared because <malay>jangan</malay> vote opposition for the sake of voting opposition like you <malay>kena tengok pandai-pandai</malay> [lah] look at the zone if it's versus what
reform party or something the the group that <malay>nampak macam</malay> gangster <malay>mat mat</malay> on the street <malay>macam mat</malay> biker <malay>ke</malay> [pe] <malay>macam</malay> at like
please [lah] if they
if they can't even give a proper speech if they can't even sound motivated on national television you think they can take care of your zone and all like <malay>pandai-pandai</malay> [ah] don't vote anyhow for the reform party [lah]
okay I cannot sorry reform party but did not specifically targeting you but it's just
okay how to say
like I get that it's good to have opposition but <malay>pandai-pandai</malay> [ah] don't
I have to admit though cause <malay>dahulu</malay> I <malay>tinggal kat</malay> #serangoon# [kan] I used to stay under worker's party area <malay>yang</malay> #hougang# #serangoon# #aljunied# <malay>itu</malay> I have to admit a lot of things were broken a lot of things weren't fixed properly that kind of thing but I guess you're right [lah] ya <malay>dia orangnya</malay> financial backing
but that's the part that I don't get <malay>kalau</malay> they're <malay>dia orang dah kat dalam</malay> government
<malay>abeh itu</malay> then they want to upgrade the resident's like area
then the money shouldn't it be equal
given regardless of your party since technically this is still
the the government see this is why you shouldn't let people our age vote we don't know about this kinda thing it doesn't it just doesn't work out
is that it's not #shahira# is it he's not suddenly right he agents near G got her she did she got her first as a back already she did really [lah] she most people said was reporting or A B for the people that she got there are only two people like the professor gift and a push by eight minus and she was so happy person as it was about I think it was about karl marx and just his communism until ya there's marks and then he's called though not really she had to like read the book or like some excerpt from the book and then she had read a whole essay advocate like two thousand words ya
[oh]
the essay was about what
just karl marx and just his communism
(ugh)
I can't believe she's in uni already that's insane
makes sense though
#bestnya#
I also want to go overseas study
(ugh) my heart pain yesterday
you have to bid it's like imagine but like on steroids
my heart pain I was I was more sad about the fact that we wouldn't get to go (uh) university exchange because look at #rifqi# he's still so close with his two friends like [eh] I also want to be friends with a cute japanese boy okay
I'm sure like and not gonna lie if both of us had applied I'm pretty sure both of us would have been shoot in students
like not gonna lie like I don't normally don't have that much confident in confidence in my abilities but like
(ugh) so sad I really cannot I'm I'm never gonna get over it <malay>aku</malay> serious <malay>nak pergi</malay> overseas

I cannot I really cannot
but did you know now that I think about it right at first I was like very sure that I wanted to do magazine but then now that we're actually during production production <malay>macam</malay>
(hmm) like not bad seems quite fun also but I guess we have to wait until we actually see what it's like <malay>bila</malay> the test [ah] I'm just scared
okay

the one that I watch
no I just know that [eh] I only watch if I know the <malay>pelakon</malay> or if I like <malay>dia berlakon</malay>
no I don't know why
did you even know there's like dramas like halted <malay>dia punya</malay> then I was [ah] before this I also like quarantine different time <malay>kat</malay> saudi [kan] so I was also keeping up to this malay drama <malay>dia</malay> I think episode thirteen <malay>pasal</malay> because of COVID <malay>dorang tak boleh</malay> film so nearly the drama is been like three months or four months it's like stuck at episode thirteen I think so I don't know how they gonna continue back or what
I know I've never seen that happen before
like when the drama the drama gets halted cause of like
influence
[oh] my god but <malay>aku pun</malay> before this I don't even like to watch K drama like I just I watch malay drama [lah] K drama <malay>malas gila</malay> so damn long
ya one hour one hour for an episode but
no but it's so annoying is like [ah] no but I only watch it if it's like if I like the main actor together <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] ya [lah] I know but like I just I cannot no but that [one] I watch one I watch so far the one that I watch so far is okay to not be okay that [one] I like and then the other [one] (uh) was when this dude <malay>ada</malay> breast cancer or something (uh) ya breast cancer [ah]
I mean ya it was so cute
ya <malay>cerita lama</malay>
(um) <malay>apa</malay> like what <malay>cerita</malay>
I know I mean I I understand the show where it's so damn long I swear
that's why I <malay>cakap</malay> I <malay>tak suka tengok</malay> K drama cause it's so draggy
yo but my mum watched the drama like six times
six times I swear every time she <malay>macam</malay> [ah] I don't know what to watch goblin then I'm like bro are you in this month in this like in this year because of COVID it because <malay>kita tak boleh keluar</malay> right and cannot do anything right I literally watch the watch goblin three or four times I'm not kidding
ya ya ya exactly
like even if I like a show pun I would like I probably like watch the person inside the show instead you know like I would search up other shows of that person
than watching the show again I cannot even no matter how much I like cannot
ya wait especially if it's like if it's like a korean drama like or like anime <malay>ke</malay> or a cartoon <malay>macam</malay> disney you know those kind of thing [oh] my god like <malay>macam</malay> fictional <malay>punya</malay> movies you know people write like fan fiction over them
for real for real I like <malay>macam</malay> one hour so attached to freaking marvel <malay>punya</malay> [ah] like you know because of like I was so attached to that because like whenever [ah] <malay>bila apa</malay> (uh) (uh) ironman died right so I was like damn I need closure I seriously need to like closure so I read a fan fiction on like how like after tony died like <malay>dia punya macam</malay> fake <malay>anak macam</malay> you know work to spiderman [lah] other than that like than I was like !wah!
that makes me <malay>macam</malay> happy already
for real I slept at I I started at like nine and I slept at nine reading like the fan fiction I'm not kidding
I'm not it was it saudi [eh] it was in saudi for real
wrong twelve
twelve
it was a series it was a really long series
but it was so cool [ah]
I don't know but like as as for me if I'm like so into something right especially like <malay>macam</malay> marvel like after <malay>ni</malay> before I <malay>masuk</malay> (uh) I watch end game <malay>aku tengok</malay> like the whole movie sequence before that
like the whole as as much as like marvel movies I could watch I really watch all that in order to understand or whatever [lah] the end game thingy
then <malay>aku baca</malay> just to make myself feel like happier
why boring it literally gives me so much like pleasure and like <malay>macam</malay> warmth and comfort knowing that <malay>macam</malay> whatever at least spiderman <malay>ada</malay> girlfriend even though it's fake and it's not like real but like you know whatever
like I mean like even K dramas I saw like <malay>macam</malay> they did like alternate these stories of like that story
like fan fiction
but the
I mean the purpose <malay>tak semestinya untuk</malay> for that but <malay>macam</malay> mostly people <malay>macam</malay> when you like something so much like you crave for more [what] <malay>macam</malay> if you <malay>kau pernah tengok</malay> spiderman [kan]
you know how spiderman (uh) (uh) spiderman before this is like spiderman when gwen right <malay>macam</malay> peter parker and gwen right like ya but the one with tom holland <malay>sekarang ni</malay> is like peter parker and but <malay>tak banyak</malay> movie of peter parker and [what] so people make fan fiction of it then <malay>kita macam</malay> [oh] my god imagine [ah] so happy
(hmm)
yes
(hmm) the main main main [one] the main main ones [ah]
endgame
like the solo characters the specific characters
(hmm)
that's why
ya it's okay <malay>tapi aku baca</malay> fan fiction just like just to make myself happy [lah] you know satisfy myself even though it's like not true not real but like it's okay
K drama
like what korean dramas <malay>kau tengok</malay>
what is that
ya
but damn draggy
that specific drama or like korean drama in general
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
like scenes
how about is it that intrigued <malay>macam</malay> like
[oh] my god that's so cool
that is interesting I like to watch video like you know like grey's anatomy or chicago med
ya
similar it's like basically everything that happens in like the in the hospital
got romance also
but I only watch but I only watch grey's anatomy I watch chicago med I don't know why I didn't watch
it's similar [lah] like the same
ya but to be honest I think it'll like K drama ones are better I don't know why
everything about K drama is so cool right
like it's okay to not be okay !wah! I was so impress
even the settings like
ya like from like basically everytime like the settings like the clothes you wear bro it !wow!
but is like probably like two a two hundred dollar hoodie you know like there (uh) so premium quality [one] just to make it really pretty and really nice
<malay>tak pernah</malay> like <malay>tak</malay> classy
like everytime [hor] I want I compare like malay dramas and korean dramas I mean since I am malay so obviously I would compare [what] like really like I don't know maybe it like speaks for the way like koreans dress in general they so aesthetic so <malay>macam</malay>
so ya and then I'm like imagine that in malay dramas
but honestly though to think about it right they use the same equipment and they can
(hmm) true
I don't know
true
no but general in general like if you want to <malay>buat</malay> like if you want to <malay>macam buat</malay> the drama [tau] like K drama they very they like go out from like they very they like they they there's no boundaries like you know how like hotel <malay>kau pernah tengok</malay> hotel #del luna# right
like bro imagine that but in a malay drama I don't think so I don't think you can do that because you know why because in malay dramas there's like limits and boundaries that you cannot <malay>pasal</malay> religion that's why
I just
I didn't watch it but I saw and I saw #kim soo hyun# at the end [oh] my god
ya cameo then he <malay>datang</malay> right
[oh] like a second season
[oh] my god I remember <malay>aku tak</malay> think of that [sia]
no but usually no that cameos in K drama in like one and in an extra character at the end in american dramas like probably means there's a second like you know stranger things
you know how there is max
at the end okay [lah] it's okay but <malay>kalau</malay> K dramas usually <malay>kalau</malay> cameo <malay>dia datang</malay> just to for fun like just there to like for that one episode one episode [jer]
second season
and also I've never heard of like <malay>macam</malay> korean drama <malay>buat</malay> second season
for real <malay>abeh</malay> maybe <malay>sebab dia macam</malay> hospital hospital
bro I would
of course <malay>[lah]</malay>
now like it's way even at like this malay station [ah] some <malay>tiga atau</malay> <malay>sembilan</malay> they they showing hotel #del luna# now you know
what K drama
[oh] my god [oh] my god #park seo joon# <malay>dekat suria</malay>

ya
like audio original I mean I mean that's why they like like over the time like I don't understand when like people especially in the western areas who cannot watch movies that are not in english like you what if you cannot watch any (uh) subtitle (uh) the subtitle at the same time like hello it's not that hard <malay>macam buat</malay> [jer] [lah] like
like do you know like this there's this one time this I don't know this what this person <malay>daripada</malay> this (uh) are actor <malay>ke apa entah dia macam</malay> [oh] ya no no not even actor I think they were in general like <malay>kau tahu</malay> parasite <malay>menang</malay> (uh) a few awards [kan] <malay>dekat</malay> america
so like (uh) I think even the the actors there or like you know a few known people there and the people <malay>yang selalu macam dorang tak</malay> happy [tau] <malay>sebab</malay> a korean movie won like an a prestigious award
ya and then people <malay>pun macam</malay> but why though <malay>pastu dorang macam cakap</malay> [lah] like like it's not in english like how you watch a movie if it's not in english how you understand and then like bro you guys are dumb or what like you can really watch and read the subtitles at the same time but I mean because you guys are so used to only your own like only english which is so sad like
even I <malay>tengok</malay> even I I <malay>tengok</malay> malay drama I <malay>pakai</malay> english subtitle [tau]
like even though I understand what <malay>droang cakap</malay> I still put english subtitles because I'm so used to seeing like subtitle and the video itself

<malay>dah penyek gila</malay>
ya exactly
!wah! I'm like I'm so blessed to be living in singapore I don't know why
I mean obviously [lah] earthquake <malay>semua ni</malay> it's all in god's hand like it can happen anytime whenever it wants to
ya I know
<malay>masha allah</malay>
[oh] my god [kan]
this COVID [jer] I don't expect all this to happen but I guess it's way it is I mean like a couple years back <malay>pun ada</malay> the spanish flu which was also like
not couple years back [lah] but like
<malay>macam</malay> a few decades ago I guess
like it was also a pandemic and ya
ya was also a pandemic if I'm not wrong
I think no [oh] my god (um)
that was like way long that was like during world war or something after the spanish flu
ya but still <malay>macam</malay> like the way it's like I mean I mean it's a history <malay>macam memang</malay> tings like this happen like even if it's not common
like SARS a pandemic no right
but it was a big thing in saudi [seh] in like middle east for real ya I was so surprised <malay>aku tak tahu yang</malay> SARS is a big thing in middle east
young right it happen during when we were like young
ya
and but I don't think when it happen <malay>kat</malay> singapore it was like that like wasn't academic also
but I think it was okay right
<malay>dorang ada</malay> vaccination wasn't there a vaccination for SARS
but it's a like a it's like a like a <malay>macam</malay> what is it called like a respiratory
but isn't it a respiratory <malay>punya</malay> virus
the same thing right asthma right ya
like I even when I saw when I heard about SARS about like when I was in school I I didn't know like it was that serious I thought it was just <malay>orang sakit tiba-tiba</malay>
I didn't know it was actually that serious then now that I'm living through a pandemic which <malay>aku</malay> still <malay>tak boleh</malay> brain
like that is so
why
you know one of my (uh) one
we have to do an assignment and it was like [oh] what what do you what what can you write a <malay>macam</malay> essay about like how like a diary like a letter to your future self <malay>macam</malay> like what if feels like to be living in a pandemic or going to a pandemic then I'm like dude I can never imagine like twenty twenty like dear future self I am living through a pandemic like that is so <malay>gila</malay> like I cannot do you understand like how we're still alive it's so weird <malay>tak boleh</malay> [seh]
no but then I'm so impressed with the I was I was so shock when I saw like the news I was so impressed that after three months this was like the twenty seventh obviously [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I mean it's death like it's not good no matter how much how much or how little like it's not great but compared to other places I'm so impressed that
it's like very controlled [seh]
like well managed
ya ya maybe that's why also
like america
region also
really
for like not for like what what's the difference
it's like it's like serious that you have to go to hospital but not as serious you have to go to a like major hospital <malay>gitu</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay
like the one day two day stay that <malay>dekat</malay> hospital that kind of thing
when they are better
just for just for
ya but when [ah]
I <malay>tak dengar</malay> [seh] I didn't know that
wait #ng teng fong# really
[oh] that's why it's like so big
so like east wing is basically like the major [one] and the other wing is actually the community hospital [lah]
!chey! I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [seh] I thought that was like a centre research centre or something I was like why this hospital is so damn big
(hmm)
ya
the house itself and how it's suppose to look like later
[oh]
so <malay>kau nampak yang</malay> hospital
how many <malay>rumah dorang nak</malay> [seh] there are so many <malay>rumah sekarang kat</malay> singapore <malay>tak apa pun</malay>
I mean now because of COVID I don't think so
they take a lot of aspect to be honest
same [lah] same like saudi like they take a lot of expats
ya ya foreigners to come work ya
but then like they now this now slowly right where like for my situation right now like in saudi they do this like <malay>apa</malay> saudi I don't know [lah] basically <malay>dorang nak</malay> kick out <malay>semua</malay> foreigners and they want to make the their own people work
that's why my dad <malay>suruh</malay> I <malay>pindah balik kat</malay> singapore cause he <malay>takut yang kalau dia tiba-tiba kena buang</malay> then like I'm in the middle of school then <malay>macam tak baik tak tak</malay> nice right for me to suddenly like ditch
ya
I know so sad [kan]
but I mean <malay>alhamdulilah</malay> [lah] maybe <malay>rezeki</malay> it's better to also
ya
actually <malay>dia kerja sana buat apa</malay> [eh]
oil I mean saudi [kan] oil

[ah] okay
okay <malay>faham juga</malay> but let me tell you something K my type of guy is like you said soft spoken but can argue with me at the correct times
but I'm also specific about whether they are [eh] yes man or no man you know sometimes guys can be like
[ah] ya ya ya do whatever you want or like [eh] no way cannot do that just because you are my girlfriend you can't do that and stuff like that I don't want like that [ah] I want
<malay>bantah</malay> no no no no <malay>bantah</malay> is you shake right
okay to make it simple I just like someone who
won't restrict me from doing the right things in life or at least things that will do me good but at at the same time I want a person who can correct me
like if I do any mistakes they won't just let me go off just like that
just because I'm their girlfriend and don't want to correct me like for example
<malay>kalau saya buat salah macam saya berbual-bual dengan lelaki lain</malay> in a
in a <malay>macam manja-manja</malay> way of course [lah] <malay>mana boleh gitu kita dah ada</malay> boyfriend of course <malay>kita kena setia</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi macam</malay> I prefer <malay>kalau dia macam</malay>
<malay>berbual dengan saya</malay> [eh] you are my girlfriend [seh] [eh] <malay>janganlah buat gitu sebab saya tak akan buat gitu awak tak akan buat gitu kita</malay> happy <malay>sama-sama</malay>
ya I want that type of person it will be so sweet
(mmhmm)

ya that's true how about your boyfriend is he on the nice side or is he on the mean side
is he mean to me [ah]
that that sounds so wrong [eh]
that's sounds okay okay anyway ya it's very hard to find these sort of nice but not too nice guy I know a lot of man who would say
[oh] this girl is too picky for saying like that if I see these online and then I'm like what the hell do you want to fight me that's like the most basic thing a guy could do for a girl [leh]
don't you think so
ya
do you think you and your boyfriend got lucky I always feel like that not lucky [pe] [seh] but like that time in
he went by chance someone said for you to look into his eyes and for him to look into your eyes are like !wahseh! so cute

ya
ya you you used to hate her so much [eh] I I found that so funny

ya
(mmhmm)
what
I feel like every time we are at the workplace or something especially if we're at an intern level or like those lowest [ah] of all candidates
we would always get told to do one thing [eh] we get to do one thing and then suddenly when we do that thing suddenly someone else say [eh] don't do it don't do that [leh] like
isn't that the job of another person or something like that then they make us go round and round and around and then I don't know we we will get scolded for it in the end
ya that happened to me also at my workplace (err)
<malay>jadi</malay> my supervisor <malay>ni melayu</malay> you my mentor <malay>pula cina</malay> [lah] then [kan] <malay>ni sebelum</malay> COVID <malay>jadi kita kena buat kerja sama-sama</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi saya yang kena</malay> pass
(uh) all these work to let's say <malay>kalau dia cakap kena</malay> pass (err) find me to another person [kan] (err) <malay>jadi</malay> I just do that [lah] <malay>tapi nanti</malay>
the person I pass it to <malay>semua</malay> they tell me that it's wrong I'm not supposed to do that then I have to go back you get that feeling
(mmhmm)
yes work from home
ya
yes yes
ya
(uh huh)
[oh] okay but the thing is <malay>yang</malay> the company itself should also update their tablets or their or their desktop or whatever because the thing is we are bound to use it whether at work or what
or home or whatever we will we will bound to use it and when we use it of course you have to use it at an optimum speed [pe]
(mmhmm) what is on your plate
(uh huh)
nine thirty as it wait what time do you start work again
what life this girl my my office hour starts at eight [leh]
okay [ah] wait how long does it take for you to get home let's say you from the office [ah]

our good friend #jannah#
you know we're we're talking about the relationship topic just now right I suddenly remembered her it remember when we went to her house
!huh! no no no
does she know know not that I know but I feel like I want to find someone for her someone special
I have no idea but you know [lah] like any of our friends who aren't judgmental
I would feel so happy for her too she's so patient with us and I feel like she would be even more patient with her husband or spouse or whatever they call that
ya but at the same time I want to find someone for her but I feel like most of my friends aren't good enough for her [leh] it's ya do you have anyone in mind for her
I know you don't have a lot of friends
what do you have
but do you have anyone in mind maybe your cousin your your your boyfriend's friend

(mm) (mm)
elections I
[oh] I don't really care too much about it but I do stay up to date sometimes what about it
(hmm)
ya correct correct and the thing is I feel like (um) to them right voting is just
it's just
something to do and then if it's funny they feel like they should do it which is so weird because in singapore we have this election thing we have to choose and then we are actually serious about it like or we have this good points and bad points
ya (uh huh)
ya [oh] ya
but but the thing is like maybe their country is
of course [lah] their country is super big it's bigger than singapore of course it will be harder to maintain right then I guess [lah] it's
it's harder for them to keep track of the votes and I I also think that most of them are like or I don't want to get involved in politics so I don't want to vote for anyone you get what I mean
ya correct correct but
but most of them still think that we are <malay>macam</malay> or they have a choice to not choose because I feel like
nowadays [kan] everyone is sensitive about everything you you know that
I I saw I saw these two video [ah] it's like satire and then it's basically [ah]
showing that people nowadays almost every single thing you have to be offended about it if you don't feel the same way
no no no please explain
ya
wait wait work culture or walk [oh] woke culture no I never heard of that [leh]
(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
suit so
like in [ah] if so basically we just have to be careful with whatever we say is it like right now I'm talking to you [oh] I feel like blah blah blah but blah blah but blah blah so I have to keep adding in defending points [lah]
but no offence to this culture blah blah blah ya you know ya okay I feel like I understand the meaning of woke culture now is it like a also something like let's say you were defending woman
then talk about rapists and stuff like that then suddenly got some guy in the comments
what about man man also will get [ah] okay I understand now what [lah] these people
(mmhmm)
yes

<malay>bukan</malay> like
ya like
[ah] <malay>kalau</malay>
as in ya [lah]
<malay>kalau kau hidup aku nak</malay> obviously like
every everything I mean like if a life has a purpose what and <malay>kalau</malay> if <malay>semua benda yang kau nak</malay> then what's the point of living right like (uh) might but basically you were just saying like

so
ya that's that's that's what's up
but ya in terms
in terms of my life
it's been hard [lah] it's hard it's been hard to tolerate life [ah] as it is [ah] obviously [ah] I mean like (uh) saying it for everyone ya <malay>tapi rabak</malay> opinion <malay>kau kau cakap</malay>
<malay>semua benda kau nak dapat takmo rabak</malay> [ah]
like
okay (um)
<malay>tapi untuk kau kalau macam</malay> about like relationship with a girl
<malay>apa kau nak</malay> like
<malay>apa kau nak</malay> (uh)
what <malay>apa kau cari dalam</malay>
(uh) in a girl for you to you know
basically (uh)
<malay>perempuan idaman kau</malay> [ah]
ya so <malay>apa apa perempuan idaman kau</malay> like
<malay>untuk aku</malay> I think like
that's (uh) in general <malay>tu apa semua laki pun nak</malay> [lah]
but like (uh) <malay>kau</malay> try think think harder think deeper like feel like deeper like <malay>apa kau nak apa kau sebenarnya nak</malay>
(uh) <malay>dalam wanita</malay> like because let's be honest [ah] like
in life you weren't like <malay>kau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>kau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>dapat perempuan yang sempurna</malay> like <malay>tak ada orang sempurna</malay> [pe] <malay>dalam hidup ni</malay>
so <malay>kau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>dapat orang yang sempurna</malay> so like just think deep like <malay>kau rasa apa yang</malay> those some qualities that
like we know you can find but
like obviously the perfect qualities like
what you're you're saying is isn't isn't going to be like totally achievable [lah] like I don't think everyone would
[eh] [ah] like a lot of you can easily find
someone like that [ah] so like
think deeper [ah] just like what's like let's say [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>cam aku</malay> okay let <malay>berbual pasal aku</malay> [eh]
<malay>untuk aku kalau aku perempuan yang aku nak</malay> is
someone <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>tak pandang aku macam</malay>
<malay>dia tengok aku macam lebih daripada lebih daripada orang lain</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>aku nak rasa</malay> like I'm like I'm just someone who whose the only one in the world [ah] like you know
you know <malay>kau faham apa aku cakap</malay> like
<malay>lawa ni semua siapa tak nak siapa tak nak lawanya orang siapa pun tak nak orang yang</malay> handsome <malay>semua orang pun nak</malay> but ya or [ah] and one more thing <malay>yang</malay> can
catch my eye is (err) is the girl funny [ah] to me if they're funny
to me if they're funny
it you know it keeps me alive [ah] it keeps me laughing I like to laugh you know [ah] <malay>apa ni ketawa semua orang suka ketawa</malay> [pe]
I mean like (uh)
ya so <malay>untuk aku perempuan kalau boleh buat aku ketawa</malay> that's already
(err) you know <malay>kalau</malay> (uh) in english <malay>dia</malay> called it like what red flag for one side of the team if
if I would say myself this is called green flag [ah] for like if they can make me laugh
if you get what I mean [ah] <malay>kalau faham</malay> [ah] <malay>kau faham tak</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay>
ya like <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau boleh buat ketawa</malay> it's already something [ah] it's like a lot [ah] for me
because to me [lah] <malay>perempuan tak perempuan perempuan tak kelakar sangat [ah]</malay> like like maybe
like a lot of the girls [lah]
maybe I I think it's biased a bit
it's quite biased because a lot of the girls
<malay>yang aku jumpa dorang tak kelakar dorang macam</malay> lame [ah] but I mean I find it cute as well but
you know
and ya I've only met like what
maybe one or two girls <malay>yang</malay> I find (uh) very entertaining and <malay>kelakar</malay> [ah]
so ya like and another quality is I would say that's achievable
(um)
<malay>dia tak payah</malay> like <malay>faham aku dia tak payah aku</malay> [ah] <malay>sepenuhnya</malay> but <malay>aku</malay> just expect <malay>aku</malay> just expect <malay>dia</malay> to be there for me get me
(uh) so like okay so let me ask you [ah] <malay>sekali lagi sekali aku tanya kau</malay>

<malay>aku cam aku cam</malay> in denial
and when I was in denial I was like
still (uh)
I wouldn't say want to force [ah] it was just like
maybe in that in a sense I guilt trip her not really guilt trip her [lah] but maybe maybe it was [ah]
I don't know [ah] for someone else to judge for you to judge or [what] [ah] like <malay>aku cakap dengan dia cam</malay> like

slowly I realised <malay>cam aku tak boleh buat pape</malay> [ah] and at one point [ah] I think I was just pestering her too much that I wasn't even pestering [ah] because actually <malay>tu</malay>
(err) <malay>hari jadi dia</malay>
and then [dah] <malay>gitu aku</malay> wish [ah]

<malay>kesah aku tak nak tanya</malay> [ah] <malay>apa khabar</malay> like what's wrong you know <malay>kalau kau nak</malay> (uh)
<malay>kongsi pape benda</malay> then <malay>kau kongsi</malay> [ah] <malay>aku</malay> don't mind like <malay>dengar</malay> hear it out
<malay>apa-apa dia dia ada ada dia perlu cakap</malay> [kan]
so <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku tanya dia</malay> [ah] like (uh)
I hope you're doing fine like I I
I've been seeing you tweeting like for what the past few days [ah] some very emotional stuff you know and if you need someone [ah] I wouldn't mind being your listening
ear you know as shoulder
you know but unless you have a boyfriend
like I I
I mean I understand I mean I'm just not trying to intrude anything I'm just trying to be
I'm just trying to
[ah]
something like that [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>terus cam</malay>
<malay>dia cam</malay>
so <malay>kita berbual berbual</malay> [lah] and then I got interested you know
[oh] [ah]
so <malay>untuk kau</malay> to be honest <malay>aku tak tahu tu</malay> too early <malay>ke tak tapi untuk kau</malay>
(uh) do you think what's what's the time limit <malay>untuk kau untuk kau</malay> move on like when do you think is the right time to move on and like
you know the right to move on to another girl and start
something fresh you know something new
<malay>untuk kau</malay>
okay when <malay>aku aku</malay> just started out with the girl
the new girl right the latest one
the one I'm having with right now (err)
I was
still in process [ah] honestly I was still in process [ah] low-key I was still in process
but
(err)
somehow I I
I move on [ah] I like to think I move on
you know and then some slowly I move on already and I finished healing and stuff you know accepted as what it is [ah] and I just wanted her to be happy and I
I want to be happy myself so ya
(err) I continue with this girl and
but why why I told you in the first
<malay>yang tadi</malay> [kan] <malay>aku cakap dengan kau</malay> [kan] <malay>pasal aku</malay> feel like it's a crime
it's because time and time again even I was already with this girl and
and I believe and I know I'm in love with this girl also right
I still think about her also sometimes you know
and
[ah] I still think about her you know from time and time again I still think like
what is she up to is she okay is she fine <malay>ke</malay>
(um)
and
what comfort I comforted myself by saying like
okay [ah] maybe like you never actually
uncare for anyone you know if you really care about someone you don't really stop caring for someone right
so maybe that's why it was happening [ah]
but it feels it feels like a crime [ah] sometimes because I just
I just don't want to hurt who I'm having [ah] because I really love what we are having already [ah] so and it's
it's also a roller coaster but
she's been good [ah]
but some time and time again I still think about
you know that previous girl and
<malay>cam</malay> how how it could have been a lot [ah] so I don't know if
I want to say if I have moved on but I know I've moved on I
I like to think like I've moved on you know but
time and time again I will ask [lah] like
what what what went wrong
[ah]
okay so it's like
actually <malay>betul</malay> actually <malay>betul</malay> ya ya ya ya <malay>aku faham aku faham</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> continue
<malay>aku faham</malay> [ah] ya ya ya you could say that [ah] but
ya so I'm
I'm still with the new girl
and it's been
a hell of a ride [ah] I would say it's been hell of a ride and time and time again
I would say that I will still think about
my previous [ah]
my previous
girl [lah] and
to me it's fine I guess you know (uh) as you said also I think it's fine [ah]
<malay>macam</malay>
to care you don't uncare for somebody <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> [pe]
so and it's okay [ah]
(um)
(mm)
but I'm still young [ah] and I I'm still very young so <malay>cam aku tak</malay>
<malay>aku tak fikir-fikir sangat macam</malay> [oh] <malay>aku akan kahwin</malay> this third girl <malay>aku</malay> [dah] <malay>tak nak fikir sangat</malay> [ah] so [dah] <malay>tiga perempuan</malay> [sia]
<malay>aku nak kena aku nak kena layan ni semua benda</malay> [kan]
so <malay>cam</malay> from my experience I'm just going out with the flow
but
doing my best as well [ah] so if it goes to where
to where I want it to be to where we both want it to be then (uh) <malay>alhamdulillah</malay>
but if not
<malay>takpe</malay> [ah]
but <malay>untuk kau</malay> in general your <malay>kau punya</malay> love life [kan]
like
(uh)
<malay>kalau kau</malay> explain in general <malay>kau punya</malay> love life how has it been like
what's wrong
maybe with you you can start with what's wrong with you
<malay>faham faham</malay>
okay okay
<malay>aku bilang aku punya juga</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk aku apa salah</malay>
<malay>apa salah apa macam benda yang aku boleh perbaiki</malay> from like past relationships
first thing
<malay>pertamanya</malay> is
I learnt I had I learnt how to let go
okay
second thing is (uh)
you know I learnt how to accept
(err)
third thing thing is (uh) I learnt how to live in the moment
all the time [ah]
<malay>hidup dengan apa yang</malay> [dah] <malay>ada kat situ</malay> [ah]
so just live [ah] you know <malay>takmo</malay>
<malay>takmo fikir banyak sangat</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal apa akan jadi</malay> in the future
<malay>kau tahu cam</malay> just live [ah] live your life
ya <malay>gitu</malay>
(um)
true ya what you said is true [ah] and
ya and then you know those are the three lessons [ah]

(hmm)
okay [lah] #pika#
[oh]
wait you talking about cat [kan] (uh) <malay>aku buka tingkap bilik aku tadi</malay>
[eh] you saw what you saw

[orh] I'm okay [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> lately <malay>rabak</malay> [ah] because (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> COVID [kan] so I cannot work so most of the time I stay at home then I just watch Netflix
<malay>atau</malay> just (uh) watch new dramas [lah] basically
ya
what's your favourite
ya ya ya ya
correct correct then the one that I regret the most <malay>sekarang</malay> is (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> the one that you invited me to watch [ah] demon slayer
ya
(uh) because the thing is like (uh) when I first saw the trailer
for me personally right [ah] (uh) <malay>aku bukan</malay> a fan of <malay>apa ni macam</malay> cute cute (uh) type of (err) art style for the (err) anime for me I prefer like <malay>macam</malay> semi realistic so the ones I watch is like initial D but when I watch demon slayer on myself
I regret <malay>gila</malay> serious because it's like (uh) the storyline <malay>bagus</malay> and then like <malay>dia punya</malay> action scenes also was quite good and then I was really blown away [ah] so like aw shit I semi regret seriously I should have started earlier cause by the time I started right (uh) it was
I was quite behind the hype already [lah] in a way
ya
(um)
[orh] okay
ya because (uh)
when I started (uh) I think I don't know how like (err) I was in cause I think (um) a lot of people watch already but [ah] even then when I watch later the hype was still there so (err) the main thing for me it's just I can't wait for season two so (uh) I haven't started yet but I'm going to try watch the #manga# [eh] I I'm gonna read the #manga# sorry not watch ya but it was really good [lah] ya
(mm)
then it ended
[orh] september
[oh] [ah] [ah]
[ah]
[oh] one shot [ah]
rise up [ah] ya
ya
(mm) (mm)
#naruto#
[ah]
(mm)
ya
that's why but (err) but (err) adding on to <malay>yang</malay> the older <malay>punya</malay> #animes# even initial D <malay>pun</malay> [kan] it started in nineteen ninety five it didn't reach that much so like so like the fact that it's brand new then <malay>macam</malay> it got so much hype and like so much (um) (err) attention right it just blows my mind [ah] ya and I really thought it's it's really nice [lah] and
not gonna lie [ah] it's very rare (um) for this kind of (err) shows or like this kind of anime to make me cry so got one time too I almost cried cause [ah] the part <malay>yang</malay>
(err) I think is the one <malay>yang</malay> the second episode <malay>yang dia pergi bunuh</malay> the very big demon then he touch the head
(uh) ya the the the one who killed the <malay>punya kawan</malay>
yes yes yes correct correct then the other one that affected me was (um) the <malay>apa</malay> moon that got strip of his (uh) power <malay>pasal dia tak</malay> (uh) eat enough humans the one who use the drums [ah]
ya (uh) I felt him cause when he was a human right he wanted to be a writer or something right then <malay>tak ada orang</malay> appreciate <malay>dia</malay> so like I can feel because I I also taking english myself so like I felt really
(uh) <malay>terkesan</malay> like I was like shocked [lah] when I cried a bit I was like [eh] <malay>tak pernah pernah macam gini</malay> the last time I cried was like (err) what endgame
[ah] (um) avengers endgame [ah]
very rare so I was blown away [ah]
[ah] no [lah] ya ya
(mm) (mm)
<malay>kompang</malay> <malay>kompang</malay> <malay>gitu</malay>
(err) <malay>tapi tapi</malay> stress [ah] <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>dia punya</malay> battle <malay>tu</malay> the other one that (err) was more stressful was the <malay>punya</malay> the he was using the spider web or something that was quite scary
ya lumen six ya but
ya he's so strong he got so pissed off when (uh) #nezuko# and #tanjiro# killed him but he attach his neck using the spider web but for me like what the heck seriously he just cut off [what] it's such a coward move but #gui# is just
<malay>sekali</malay> a one time slash then <malay>mati</malay>
that's why <malay>tak</malay> fair <malay>gila</malay> serious
ya
ya ya ya ya ya correct correct correct
ya
(mm)
blow me away it's okay
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya ya even the intro <malay>dia punya</malay> what they call it opening I don't know opening [ah] the opening was also quite <malay>macam</malay> blood pumping [ah] for me personally but the one that hit me the most like for me personally [eh] for you is the music [kan] for me is the [ah] story line itself
ya and the part when he everytime when he kill the demon right he always like
(um) (uh) give them a proper farewell or like a form of respect <malay>macam dia tak</malay> just <malay>bunuh</malay> cause [oh] you're a demon cause (err) he take the time to like understand them look back [ah] look through their memories and then like say like [eh] you used to be human [lah] so it's not your fault you became a demon so that that part is I think the
(uh) I think that's the main [ah] unique point of [ah] demon slayer it's not just about killing demons it's about having a heart
(mm)
correct correct
(mm)
correct correct yes
ya ya ya
(mm)
correct
ya correct
ya that's why but the thing the thing that (uh) (um)
I I kind of (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> regret a bit right apart from (um) not catching up to demon slayer earlier on is that (err) to be honest but previously I was quite judgemental of anime [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> I look <malay>macam</malay> [ah] sometimes look at the art style <malay>macam</malay> very cutesy cutesy <malay>dia macam takda</malay> substance to it [ah] but then when I take the time to analyse right actually some #animes# are good it's not everytime <malay>macam</malay> those like (uh) act cute <malay>atau macam</malay> very cringe cosplay cause let's be honest there there are cringey cosplayers and all that but some of the #animes# are really damn good so <malay>aku macam</malay> semi regret so for me personally [ah] for demon slayer right I started on #naruto#
(um) [ah] I know it's one of the best #animes# but draggy <malay>gila</malay> it's too draggy for me but I'm just gonna take the time to like watch [ah] but waiting for season two demon slayer then like you said you recommend also [ah] the day before <malay>pasal</malay> one piece so that [one] will try so I start #naruto# first and then one piece but I don't know which one is longer #naruto# or one piece [ah] actually
one piece [eh] (uh) because (uh) #naruto# the one I saw on Netflix is like
nine season
and then ya then but the good thing about anime is like each episode it's twenty minutes [lah] so it's not too not too <malay>macam</malay> mundane I guess
ya especially like the those korean dramas ya <malay>tapi</malay> are these sorry is this the format for (err) anime like each episode got twenty minutes <malay>atau</malay>
[oh]
(mm) (mm)
ya
(mm)
[oh] <malay>kira macam</malay> movie is it
[orh] short film
(mm)
ya
[ah]
[pe]
ya ya ya
(mm)
ya the atmosphere won't be there the mood confirm <malay>hilang</malay> ya
(mm)
ya
ya
correct correct
standard ya
because speaking of this music and setting atmosphere right I think you also got do like music editing right for your game before ya ya in in school cause you're taking <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> [ah] <malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) I don't know if the name is still correct is correct me if I'm wrong
(uh) bachelor of arts
in game design not bachelor of science [one] science is programing [ah] ya
ya I see your math <malay>semalam</malay> [jer] <malay>dah tak boleh tahan</malay> that's why I I don't take math
ya
(mm)
(mm)
that's why
correct correct <malay>yang semalam</malay> you show me the <malay>pasal apa tu</malay> row operation that [one] obviously I try [ah] but I really I really don't understand [lah] but the first few question I understand [lah] ya
ya [ah] the the velocity part I think
[ah] something like that ya ya but sorry my math <malay>tak bagus sangat</malay>
[ah]
correct
ya ya ya ya ya ya
(mm)
(mm)
[oh]
(mm) famous [ah] ya ya ya
true like cannot generalise
(mm)
(mm)
correct
(mmhmm)
ya ya correct
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya
ya
because your friends always around you but I will say uni like really force you to be it is either you [ah] force you to be independent is one thing then like if you really try it yourself <malay>tak faham</malay> then you have to like (uh) you know push far and ask around cause if not right you are stuck ya that's what I felt <malay>juga</malay>
when I started
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
ya
correct correct
ya
correct correct
ya ya
yeah I guess <malay>macam</malay> (uh) if like you if you like <malay>tanya</malay> then like you didn't try then think <malay>macam</malay> people think that you don't put in the effort that kind of thing then they will start to like have that kind of judgement so like that that that's the that's the dilemma I have also but most of the time I guess it it's our duty to try first and then like really <malay>kalau macam</malay> we are stuck there right then we just have to ask around if not really gone
ya but the the good thing about (uh) your course is that (uh) at least you know some of the people there already like some are before some are for me personally <malay>rabak gila</malay> [ah] [ah] I take english but then like (err) if even when I try my own right I really cannot do it so like most of the time I ask my lecturers a lot of question in fact I also got ask you some questions about my assignment <malay>juga</malay>
ya ya cause <malay>mak kau cikgu</malay> ya ya ya that's why it's it's true [ah] like I I always thought I had the mindset like <malay>boleh buat sendiri boleh buat sendiri</malay> just <malay>belajar</malay> [jer] just but then like eventually you're stuck then when you realise that you got different opinions right after you try right then at least you [ah] they call it (um) crystallisation of your thinking like make your (uh) [ah] word flow much more (uh) smoother [ah] in a way at least you can understand from different sides
ya [eh] <malay>tak tak</malay> I I saw in my study guide <malay>apa</malay> crystallise your thinking or something like it's not crystallisation (uh) like (um) basically they encourage <malay>macam</malay> (um) making study groups and all that cause for me like (uh) like you (err) yourself [ah] <malay>aku pun</malay> introvert that time (um) when I want to try ask <malay>macam malu-malu</malay> cause I feel #paiseh# [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
people think like you don't do your (err) revision or studying beforehand but it is what it is [ah] sometimes when you're stuck you have to ask for help
(mm)
ya
[oh] this is new
this is new for me I never hear that term before
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] <malay>kira macam</malay> the vibe is it like you can feel the vibe [ah]
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
(mm)
ya ya correct correct
(mm)
ya
(uh) ya ya ya ya ya
in a way [ah] in the same time at the same time from what you explain <malay>macam</malay> is to juggle the <malay>perasaan</malay> of the people right ya ya you like you have to be careful cause
(um) some (um) I think it's very rare [lah] that there are people who are very <malay>macam</malay> clear cut direct cause most of the time people try to <malay>jaga hati</malay> and try to be more mindful what they say
but it depends on the person itself [lah] but for me personally I think a a balance of the two is nice [ah] ya when you are when you know how to get your points across properly
but at the same time you don't like come off
as very (um) ruthless or very blunt [lah] <malay>macam</malay> later like even though the approach you have are valid I think the person will feel <malay>macam</malay> very (um)
[ah] that's why that's why <malay>rasa kecil hati kirakan</malay> ya
ya
ya
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
correct correct
[ah] then when they continue doing that then they don't learn [kan] they don't go then like they keep having that mindset and attitude right then when they grow up right then will like realise <malay>asal semua orang</malay> keep attacking them ya that's the number one thing that's one thing I had to learn myself cause for me <malay>masa dulu</malay> I was very sensitive so now I try to <malay>macam</malay> balance out [lah]
but I guess I still have some traits of that sensitivity but I try my best [lah] cause over time like you have to
(um) adapt [ah] I I guess that's the most important word adapting especially during COVID now out of all the stuff that's going on ya
ya
yes yes yes
(uh)
ya can I share one story ya okay <malay>pasal</malay> I'm guilty of this so (err) so (err) (err) (err) the the one thing that (err) you mentioned about time management there is it for me [kan] honestly speaking [ah]
(err) for my
past exams I think this semester I only got two exams so I'll be honest [ah] this one I haven't share with you before (uh) so (um)
I kind of (err) didn't sit for my paper
ya so (err) this news right I'm just telling you this (um) okay so my school right what the policy that they have is that (um) if you don't sit for your paper
and then (uh) if you have (err) I think the requirement for the assignments is like (err) forty percent and above that means your over [ah] there are two components (uh) assignments and exams so for each component you must get forty percent forty percent so if once your assignments you get forty percent right you have the liberty to sit out of the exam and then we retake it the next semester without (err) redoing the entire mod
but if you fail your assignments and then you didn't sit for exam right you have to retake the entire mod but it's actually once you fail your assignments right you have to retake the entire mod [ah] so
for me
okay [lah] for me since I'm new to it [lah] like I I just got into a relationship so like I'm trying to
balance and all that so I admit [ah] sometimes I'm guilty of like not having that time management so I didn't have that much time to study so (um) before I made the decision to like sit out these two exams right like I (uh) consulted (err) my partner and my mother then they said that is fine [lah] then I think about it <malay>macam tak</malay> affect my grade cause there was a time before [what] I failed my exam then my (uh) drop <malay>rabak gila</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (um)
I have to rebuild it slowly so I thought about it like (um) if I can just resit for exam might as well take next semester and just (err) restudy [lah] and the good thing [ah] about my school now is that since COVID right (uh) they allow us to aid they're going to waive off the resit fee cause by right (uh) you have to pay the fee [tau] it's not free resitting the paper I think it's hundred dollars for mine for mine that time but now it's free [lah] cause of COVID so like I'll just do it [lah] but even though with these factors in place and I still feel guilty <malay>macam</malay> I feel so bad <malay>macam kirakan</malay> I can clear the mod [one] then <malay>macam</malay> I'm just dragging but when I think about it I'd rather take this than risk my again (uh) cause (uh) the last time I checked if I fail again [kan]
<malay>aku boleh tendang sekolah</malay> [lah] like fully [ah] I (err) I think that's the requirement for my school first is academic warning letter then after that is (err) academic termination then you have to it's as if (err) after you <malay>kena</malay> terminated it's as if you have to (err) re-enrolled [lah] to the school so that's the downside [lah] so I'm like [ah] I don't wanna take the risk [ah] I don't mind dragging but my still maintain
(mm)
ya
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
[orh]
[oh]
like like
for one semester is like below two point eight straight away <malay>kena</malay> that kind of
[oh] range [oh] okay okay okay
[ah] [ah] that's what I <malay>kena</malay> ya that's why I'm like very scared now so like my now I'm slowly repairing so like it's in like in the mid twos [ah] if I'm being honest so like I think about it [ah] <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] just resit [ah]
I don't want to risk it ya <malay>sakit</malay> [sia] <malay>hati</malay> that time ya
ya
correct correct and it's not easy seriously seriously uni is not easy already get ya so when my friend said that he cried right I thought it was exaggerating but then like now I know what he feel what he's feeling but I I cannot entirely relate and I don't have the right to [lah] cause I'm part time then they're full time so like for me right my expect for full time students are way higher even though they say like for us part time then have to work and all that is harder for us to balance right [oh] for me full time is harder cause like even though you got all the time to study right but you really have to manage your time like for the different modes and the different [ah] assignments and projects ya so because your school is (uh) assignment and project based my [one] is [ah] exam so that's the thing you all also have (err)
intermittent exams right
math [oh] my goodness
don't have (err)
(uh) not exactly math but I think (err) since your mum is a english teacher she should know also (err) there's this thing called (err) phonetics and (um) what is it under [ah] it's under
something like that ya exactly my goodness I hated that ya because it's more of like (um) if I can put it simply right like everything you see right there's like a structure to it like in a sentence right like there's the subject verb like there's a lot of that object complement and all that so
(um) put simply in every sentence in every word you utter right there is a (um) sort of a structure to it and then like for every structure there's a term for it
that's the difficult part [lah]
(uh)
there is one ya ya there is (uh) the (uh) what mod I took I think they taught us about (err) there are some similarities (uh) between (err) varieties of a particular language or like how a a language different from the other like how the structures
(uh) are there but how there are different so that (um) when you speak a certain language right and someone is speaking a certain language they you don't understand each other then like how if you're speaking variety or dialect of it right you you understand so for example english your singapore english and malaysian english right you can understand but if I'm talking english [eh] I'm if I'm speaking english and <malay>kau cakap macam</malay> [ah] there are structures to it that make it different [ah] I think it's [ah] sorry if I pronounce wrongly mutual intelligibility or something like ya between languages [ah]
(mm)
ya ya ya
ya something like that [lah] like they have a (uh) a grammar structure specific for that language and a grammar structure specific for this language ya so we just study the differences [ah] ya so that's why they say we cannot understand different languages [ah] if like you use (uh) malay then I use english in like I really don't understand malay you don't understand english then like <malay>susah</malay>
ya ya ya ya ya ya something like that
ya correct correct
ya
(um) ya [lah] because essentially
it's a translation but then like (err) one word is before the other or one word is after the other so that's the that's the thing and it's very complicated to explain cause like for me when I see the like if you want to really analyse right like you there's a lot of different structures and then like (err) the placement of the words and all that so that's the difficult part [ah] ya I think there was once I I look (err) the one that my prof taught me was (err) <malay>apa ni</malay>
professor ya sorry (err) professor [ah] [eh] [ah] so casual <malay>panggil</malay> prof (uh) she talk about english in (uh) do I call it france or french french french sorry sorry sorry sorry france is the country ya <malay>allah</malay> [eh] sorry sorry (err) so basically (um)
(err) they said that like for french
like the verb or the subject comes first and then for english is the subject then the verb comes or something like that
ya so like like easier like
post office [sia]
<malay>pejabat</malay> office right
[ah] <malay>pejabat pos</malay> so it's like it's reverse [ah] so that's the different thing
[oh] ya but okay [lah] (uh) that's the difficult part then another aspect that we learn is about (err)
language and society like how people use language and all that that [one] is more to (um)
I would say (uh) you're studying english in a
geographical way
in a way ya you you learn how [ah] different regions and how different countries use the language ya like
[ah] dialect and culture ya so if I can put it simply it's (uh) in the course I'm taking right is the technical side which I really don't like and the more of (err) analytical type of a more research based type ya
these two is okay the one that really
headache now [eh] I wish I I don't have to take is (uh) literature
ya I don't know cause usually my course is english in psychology but then now they rebrand it [ah] so is english language and literature so like you have to take a minor in that so like if let's say you take minor english language and literature with communications for example so like so <malay>panjang</malay> right so like [ah] [tau] <malay>boleh takpe</malay> [lah] just let it go but I also don't understand why they suddenly (uh) change it like that like (um) they just make it english language and literature like (um) why they don't have the presets cause last time (uh) when I first enrolled it was english with psychology english sociology something like that ya then like when I saw that (um)
but they rebrand it so like no choice [ah] I just stayed [ah] cause I have to defer for (err) one semester

<malay>apa ni</malay> putting all your happiness right into this materialistic stuff then eventually it just wear on you

correct (uh) there's one prime example (uh) I think is everyone's favourite
unfortunately he died already [ah] it's iron man games of thrones <malay>tak</malay> game of thrones <malay>tak</malay> that (uh) one prime (uh) character in the Marvel (uh)
wait is he is not right [ah] Marvel cinematic universe [ah] iron man [ah] he don't have any powers but like he he's (uh) drive to make the world a better place and too (um) I think in age of ultron he said he want to like (uh) have a iron barrier around earth (uh) to like sort of protect [lah] but (um) even though there were disagreements on his style right at least he got the intention to like (uh) protect what's what matters to him the most [ah] so like (um)
(uh) adding to your part <malay>macam</malay> (uh) when you're someone normal and you don't have any powers you eventually (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay>
get the power from your own (uh)
belief and then like [ah] actually (um) it's not technically a superpower [lah] but it's more of like it's (err) <malay>apa tu</malay>
(err)
his ability to (uh) be a genius
and like (uh) construct new things like his suits his nano tech in infinity war so that's the beauty of it [lah] like people always look at the (uh) powerful heroes like for example who can you think of thor
how
(uh) thanos
but then like the ones who are more normal right [ah] and don't have that much power I I guess they are the superheroes [ah] and truth be told iron man really was the truth hero cause like for me
keep up that that's the that's the ironic thing [eh] cause I just realised this now I'm having this (uh) [eh] epiphany <malay>macam</malay> if you notice [eh] in endgame
(uh) black widow and iron man <malay>tak ada</malay> power [tau] but because of them right they save the entire universe you think about it because black widow sacrifice herself for the soul stone then (uh) iron man <malay>dia</malay> (uh) take the <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) gauntlet from (err) thanos so like that part was already scaring me cause when he snapped right I thought it they really [ah] all the efforts for nothing but then like (err) he managed to get all the infinity stones on his (uh) hand then he just snap [ah] so it takes a lot of (um) courage to do that you know so like it was is is really (um) mind blowing to think that the two people who saved the universe didn't have that much powers they're just normal human beings with like one has a
I think she was like (err) (um)
(uh) assassin or some sort then she got (um) (err) close combat (err) training and iron man is just (err) a man with a suit [lah] but the proper intentions so like
it's really quite (err) touching [ah] if you think about it no power [tau]
(mm)
ya
correct
yes
(mm)
ya <malay>macam</malay> that day [jer] this is the type of body that you want on the beach [oh] my goodness
(mm)
ya ya
[ah] <malay>dah kurus</malay> ya ya

(mm)
it motivates you [ah] in a way

ya
it's very tough it's not it's not that easy to reach out to people [ah]
(mm)
yes
<malay>dan</malay> cause also (um)
ya like you mentioned even though it's difficult right it will be rewarding for you in the future because like I notice (um)
in the traineeship or the united jobs right cause like since I only part time now [ah] [eh] I'm working part time [lah] ya I am working part time studying part time sorry I'm correct sorry sorry sorry [ah] but my job got suspended because of COVID so like (err) I cannot work for the meantime so (um) I just have a look in the website right and when you mention about programming right it it is very useful cause most of the jobs that required programming so what you do is you you are technically on the right track it's not that easy [ah] but it's you're on the right track [ah] so it is relevant [lah] it's a good thing
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya
(mm)
ya ya ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
yes
ya
ya
so so so so technically they are like you but they they because of the (err) pre-judgement that they might get they just keep quiet and they don't want to approach anyone
like it's even more (um) [ah] amplified [lah] I guess <malay>lagi lagi malu</malay> [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
ya
ya
yes
ya
correct
ya
(mm)
ya
[ah]
ya you need to (um) get the answer and then like you have to analyse it and then like tune it in a way that it suits your current situation
ya ya
ya ya
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
tip top [ah]
nobody want to play ya ya ya correct correct
(mm)
ya
ya
ya
ya
ya
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] some do play some do play not going to lie <malay>tapi</malay> (um)
ya <malay>sebab</malay> but it's more suited for the mature audience [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[eh] <malay>tak lari</malay> [eh] topic <malay>lari</malay> that's why
ya
ya
ya
okay okay <malay>takpe takpe</malay> go [jer]

(mm)
(mm)
ya
element [eh]
and in it's an ingredient for you to
(mm)
ya
it's very useful
ya
ya
ya
but even if you can right for me personally I don't want I I'm scared cause like (err) I I heard there's zero the zero gravity why am I stuttering (uh) the zero gravity there is quite (uh)
quite intense [ah] so for me for someone who has motion sickness like I don't think I can manage ya ya but then that's quite an achievement that he wants to achieve (uh) being buried in mars so ya I wonder how his body is gonna like stay unless you like strap it or something [ah]
ya cause if he want to be married [eh] buried in mars so like I don't know how he's going to go about that
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
that's why
ya
it's another planet
<malay>kat</malay> mars
ya
(mm)
(mm)
moon burger
<malay>dia pergi</malay> [eh]
ya ya ya
space Grab
<malay>atau</malay> Grab express (uh) deliver parcel
ya but how many light years away is mars [ah]
I never thought about it [eh]
ya
[oh] it's not light years
years
[oh] but the toil you will take on the human body if you do this travelling will be quite tough [eh]
I don't know how they do it [sia] seriously
ya ya ya correct
young [ah] !wah! that's a good thing [eh] like we can remain forever or like we can eliminate any <malay>apa tu</malay>
(err) ailments so you won't get sick or something ya
ya ya [orh] then (err) it'll be relatable to (uh) demon slayer when (uh) in the movie (uh) what's his name [eh] [ah] correct me if I'm wrong [ah] #asaka# <malay>ke</malay> #akaza# #akaza# he wanted to offer (uh) #rengoku# to be a a demon [what] ya so but he says the beauty of it is that humans die [ah] so
(um) if you remain at technically if you get to live forever <malay>atau</malay> you (um) remain here forever like you lose the beauty in it (uh) like if the circle of life doesn't go full circle
ya when you get you're born and then you live through your life and then you die then like the cycle continues so like it will be stuck there you'll be alive [ah] then you wouldn't die [ah]
it's really it's really the beauty of it I guess
(mm)
ya
correct correct
ya
(mm) (mm)
that's right
ya ya ya
<malay>takyah mandi</malay>
ya
correct correct ya ya ya
ya
because you don't have to drive to progress [ah] then like you just stay stagnant [ah] like (uh) because it's not affecting you [what] and that's the thing about humans [lah] like we are selfish that the moment we think it doesn't affect us right we don't care about
ya that's the that's the number one thing
but probably why [ah] sorry I keep relating to demon slayer cause it's quite relatable [ah] (err) probably why the <malay>apa</malay> six demon didn't (uh)
change [ah] the [ah] sorry the upper moon sixteen they don't get change [ah] but if you think about it they remain stagnant but I haven't read the #manga# or the watch the (uh) talk about season two personally I feel that in the end
the the humans will try my I don't know for sure but but the desire to keep trying and even though you fail a lot of times which I feel that there's gonna be a lot of (um)
drama in the anime itself but the if you keep trying right eventually you triumph [ah]
apart from the people who remain stagnant
and don't progress because they feel that they already good enough
(mm)
(mm)
ya
yes
ya
correct correct
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
that's the sad thing right people only recognise people when they die unfortunately
that's a sad thing
ya
(mm)
ya
ya and they look to you as a way to (err)
is #bangkok# the correct word like a way to (um) set the bar like I I (err) do as an inspiration [ah] in a way
ya
so that's the good thing
(mm)

yes [oh] my god my favourite wrestler then he retire

[ah] #diego maradona#
that's quite sad [ah]
[ah] ya
(mm)
ya
I guess when
the rule of thumb is there a rule of thumb [eh] I guess [ah] when people pass on they look at the good things [ah] and they try to overlook the (uh) bad things that they've done ya cause they remember him for his skills for his jubilee for his achievements
(um) his negative aspects (um) (err)
even though they were quite drastic but (uh) the achievements overshadow that [ah] but in the end when everyone passes on right is (um)
their it's a normal human nature to like honour them [ah] recognise that even though like how bad they are right everyone deserves a proper (um)
what's the word [eh] passing [eh] no (um) [ah] final respects I guess ya so that's the most important
status (err) for awhile then like (um) at least you (um) go in peace [ah] like ya you don't feel like [oh] (um)
there's anything left
[ah] ya ya ya you you feel like (err) a burden off your shoulder [ah] in a way
what's why
(mm)
making one of the best anime
[oh] my goodness
ya
(mm)
that's why it's amazing how this (um) shows like Marvel anime and all these right like they teach us more
than what we are taught in school it's really interesting right
ya
okay
(uh)

!huh! serious
[oh] like that I play [eh]
I also just finish my exam like a week ago
so
I think I can start
<malay>main balik</malay> [ah]
but my rank is really low
like
I think I even hit the chicken
<malay>yang ayam punya</malay> rank
so I'm not sure but I can
log in later and see
I hoped they revamp a lot of the
better [eh] no their
hero <malay>lama</malay>
cause like they are so underused like
I'm pretty sure they still got value left
[oh] #layla# and #eudora#
but
<malay>aku main</malay> more to majors tho so
but I think I want to try playing fighter also [ah]
(hmm)
but I (hmm) but I used to play assassin also [ah] last time but I stop already cause like assassin is too squishy
then
[oh] and the toxic player back then is
<malay>melampau</malay>
so
I try not to play assassin anymore then my rank also went down like from eighty percent
and then it falls to like
I think it's lesser than fifty
so I'm still embarrass if people ask me for my rank and not to mention <malay>aku punya</malay>
skin is
one of those really premium skin that no one can get and truth to be told <malay>aku</malay> actually spend
diamonds
on that skin
I spent like
sixty dollars just for the skin on a a hero that I don't even play anymore
so
you know what
I will play mobile legend I will make that sixty dollars worth
okay so you're mythic but
like at least for me [kan] <malay>aku kena baca</malay> all the builds <malay>dulu</malay> [tau] <malay>dengan tengok</malay> video <malay>semua</malay> before <malay>aku main</malay>
so if you wanna if you want me to play [ah] I need to like
really do my research for my sixteen dollars game I'm bad seeing revamp heroes them I'm pretty sure they going at the buff heroes also
really
do my research for my sixty dollars game
(hmm)
but since they revamp hero
then I'm pretty sure they're gonna debuff heroes also
and then I definitely can't play sixty dollar #karina# anymore
okay wait no I will I will not I have I have to it's sixty dollars
to do it
I think
I will start slow [ah] do you know that
<malay>kalau</malay> rank
rank <malay>siang</malay> my chicken rank
all the players are new right but because I'm not new so I'm actually
wait how do I say
like taking advantage
of the situation
where people think like <malay>kita semua</malay>
player <malay>baru</malay> but
truth to be told there's a nerd under there who knows all their builds
and like witnesses
so
I'm gonna like
I'm gonna rank up and I'm gonna purposely lose so that I can stay in this rank forever and feel like a
like a winner
are you with me
okay okay [lah] if you say the toxic is already lessen
<malay>aku</malay> join [lah]
(err)
but since you're a mage or a marksman then I think I will go for those like
I'm close range [ah]
cause like if you fight from afar then <malay>siapa yang nak</malay> fight <malay>dekat depan tiada orang</malay>
[oh] ya wait I actually I can actually be a tank I remember I would do when <malay>kita</malay> lolita <malay>dengan apa</malay> [ah]
like lolita <malay>dengan siapa</malay>
(err)
is it I was aurora
I'm not so sure
(hmm) but
okay ya I think I'll be the tank I think I remember being a minotaur
and I was just going hulk on like everywhere
(um) but <malay>aku nak</malay> try fighter <malay>juga</malay> [ah]
I got this one new fighter that I rarely use but okay wait I didn't spend money on this this is
all hard work (uh huh)
(err)
I got the premium skin the what is it called [ah] the dragon
the dragon hunter no so bad ass
ya ya it's the #freya# it's the fighter and they did <malay>dia orang macam</malay> revamp #freya# right but because <malay>macam tiada orang</malay> like no one really hear nor really plays #freya# that much so
take #freya# for granted so that's why when like if you see people who know how to play #freya# [eh] #freya# but actually I've actually right actually do not know how to play #freya# at all I think that one time when you did show me play #freya# and like I got eighteen kills [kan]
actually <malay>itu aku</malay> smash buttons [jer] bro <malay>aku tak tahu apa aku buat kadang-kadang pun aku tak tahu aku tak baca</malay> skill <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> just smash smash
<malay>tak tahu macam mana menang tapi menang</malay> [lah] then like
I know you say I'm good but actually in the truth I was just smashing buttons
(hmm) so the skin pretty [lah] but the skill not there [ah] <malay>itu itu</malay> I think <malay>kau main dengan aku punya #freya# aku</malay> think <malay>kau pun boleh menang</malay> eighteen <malay>senang gila</malay>
the rank so I think <malay>aku</malay> just
go back to ranking up [lah] I cannot stay my chicken lane forever right
okay [lah] I will rank I will rank
I also can like ideate do some research on #freya# <malay>sikit</malay> [jer] <malay>bukan macam</malay> full blast <malay>macam aku punya</malay> #vexana# <malay>semua</malay> yet if you hear my #vexana# right
and I like I the few times I play aqueduct but man I'm going I'm gonna hang all the way and zero death brewers zero deaths my kiddie is so high you she's the queue depth ratio you know as it
like I
the few times I play
<malay>aku dapat</malay>
<malay>menang menang menang</malay> all the way and zero deaths bro zero deaths
my is so high
she's the kill or death ratio
you know what's that right
ya so the kiddie [eh] like shows your survival later but !wah! I tell you when you play [lor] ringing like
ya so the like shows your survival rate [lah]
like !wah! I tell you when you play low rank right
like it's so it's so easy so like
(um) <malay>tak payah fikir tak payar fikir sangat</malay> [lah] some more #vexana# is like slow kind
but when you play low rank the players are also slow
so <malay>macam</malay> easy target <malay>gitu macam macam dia orang</malay> walking ducks then <malay>kau</malay> hunt <malay>dengan</malay> rifle then it's hunting season [lah] bro so like
shoot shoot [jer] <malay>tapi aku</malay> mage so ya <malay>aku</malay> shoot shoot <malay>gini lembat gila tapi</malay> target <malay>masih kena</malay>
<malay>alhamdulilah</malay>
okay I will I will stay stagnant I'm so long I'm having fun I'm flowing I'm good I'm gucci and I will I will rank I also want to challenge myself if it's I always play low rank then easy kill hunting season fun <malay>dia macam</malay>
it gets boring [kan] I need a challenge also
(mm) that's why I'm trying to find new heroes to play I try cyclops but
cyclops have so many weaknesses
<malay>merapek</malay> it's like one of those weak
majors but <malay>kalau kau tahu main</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi kalau kau tak tahu main</malay>
then <malay>ramai orang panggil kau</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [ah] jessie is bad which is not good that's why I left the sixty dollars game
but it's okay I I will practise because I did so much research back then
and my win rate right now is like sixty eight percent I think that's not so bad for just a few matches and some more I think back then
the few matches was like in epic
the rank and come on you don't see people play cyclops in epic rank unless
like one of those suddenly no choice you they have to take a mage so they have to use cyclops
you have to take a mitch whose entity cyclops nail kilo but so kilin so long you don't take our ronaldo aruna is bloomberg to good a good idea
then okay [lor] but so long okay [lah] so long you don't take aurora tho
aurora is <malay>lembab</malay>
<malay>dia tahu golek golek</malay> [jer]
<malay>dia belakang</malay>
and okay she's good but
but her damage is good but
dude she's too slow man she's slower than #vexana# at least
#vexana# burns (um) <malay>dia punya</malay> target <malay>semua tapi</malay> like aurora
<malay>macam</malay> step <malay>lawa</malay> [jer] shiny shiny <malay>macam dia setakat</malay> over then I <malay>dengar</malay> [eh] <malay>tak nak nanyi</malay> let it go
to [jer] <malay>dia tahu</malay>
but okay I'm like try to play fighter and ex cause
my if I can smash button blindly and still win at #freya# if I were to put my hundred percent
I think I can
I'm invincible
okay since you have so much trust in my #freya# I will give it a head [oh] but
besides #freya# what else because you cannot play
fighter what is this dragon <malay>apa ini</malay> dragon rider
[eh] <malay>dia jadi</malay> dragon <malay>ini bukan jadi</malay> dragon rider
<malay>ini apa</malay>
dragon tales [lah]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tak pernah nampak</malay> character <malay>itu ini</malay> [lah] what's in the league
but okay besides fighter do we so need a tank I'm still trying to find the tank that suits me
because I'm someone who
what I say
like have you seen me play #balmond# I went to ulti on minion
I I don't even think the minion took damage [eh]
so like
I think <malay>kalau ada</malay> background music <malay>untuk aku punya</malay> #balmond# [kan] <malay>nanti bila dia buat yang</malay> ulti <malay>itu dengar</malay> quack
<malay>pasal tiada orang kena</malay>
but okay [lor] #balmond# <malay>aku</malay> think
no okay why <malay>aku</malay> choose #balmond# [kan] because when my sister (um) she just started playing so you have new characters to play
and like #balmond# is like one of those free [lah]
so <malay>aku</malay>
choose #balmond# [lah] cause I think not many people want to take tank if you really really start so low like you're low rank
then
I play #balmond# and then people think it's a it's a fighter but actually it's a tank so so you have like extra health
so
while I was on the filed playing [kan]
whenever people like it's quite easy to it's actually chase players
with a #balmond#
and then when you start spinning what they don't know is when you spin and you hit
the tank beyblade
you I'm actually gaining health so like what that that's what they don't know so you know my health is going down right but actually their health is going even lower because I'm actually gaining theirs but I only learn this recently cause I
I did my research on a #balmond#
okay at least <malay>kau sedar diri</malay> then <malay>boleh</malay> [lah]
<malay>kau jangan</malay> step <malay>jadi</malay> tank #yu zhong# <malay>ke apa</malay> dragon <malay>orang semua ingat kau nak</malay> dragon up <malay>ke</malay> dragon tales
okay [lah] [eh] the eye
(uh huh) ya I did my research on #hilda#
do you know they revamp #hilda# that's why it's actually
(uh)
<malay>dia macam</malay> hype <malay>sekarang</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia orang dia orang</malay> revamp #hilda# and like really give her
a lot of buffs from what I read which is
one thing is the health regeneration
regeneration when she's in the bush
so <malay>korang semua</malay> recall [kan] this #hilda# sneaky <malay>dia dekat dalam</malay> bush and she's just recovering health consistently
so like recall button #hilda# they don't exist you know
she's just like working out in the bushes gaining health doing push ups
[eh] but
it's twenty four K coins and I'm so tempted to buy #hilda# but I scared like !wah! I scared like it doesn't suit me but I like the
<malay>kau tahu kau dalam</malay> bush [kan] then you press this one skill later your speed <malay>laju</malay>
<malay>nanti kau</malay> zoom <malay>dengan</malay> #hilda# <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> muscle muscle <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>itu yang aku suka macam kau dah terperanjat</malay> like <malay>kalau ada</malay> music background [ah] <malay>nanti dengar</malay>
then she suddenly just ran out the bush running
ya but I will practise her [lah] if I but I think I'm gonna spend on shortcuts first [lor] cause like I don't want to waste twenty four K coins I don't have ninety coins in my wallet unlike some people I don't know what are they doing with those coins
<malay>apa itu dia orang nak</malay>
you save one million coin then you get bonus is it <malay>mana ada</malay> spend [ah]
<malay>simpan pun buat apa ini apa</malay> saving account
okay [lah] ya I think if we
were to put a real term on #hilda# it's like all of a sudden [kan] <malay>kau tengah buat kerja</malay>
then all of a sudden <malay>ada</malay> one train railway rail suddenly all of a sudden right a railway underneath appear under your feet then suddenly one train coming towards you then obviously you at the railway how to run right [ah] <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dah ada tempat</malay> protector <malay>semua</malay>
so <malay>dah</malay> [lah] <malay>habis</malay> [lah]
well but I don't know [lah] I don't know how to get her I think I need to farm up like farm faster cause I don't know when I'm a tank right I always keep thinking of supporting
other players but players don't support me and I that that that actually kinda applies in real life so
apparently
life imitates art
#hylos# I don't
I mean the reason why I don't like #hylos# cause there's this thing where he does is that he will use his own
was it mana to like like be a
a working furnace where he just burn like he's burning himself to furnace constant consistently then <malay>bila</malay> mana <malay>dia habis</malay> [kan] then
you burn your health then <malay>macam</malay> like you the tank so like people already burning down your health then <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>kau dah tiada</malay> mana then <malay>kau pun</malay> burn down
<malay>itu dah</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> double edged sword [lah] <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>kena macam</malay>
lost world <malay>itu</malay>
that's why I don't like #hylos# I mean ya he's thick
but
that kind of a skill takes
people who knows how to gauge when
to fight
then when to retreat and then went to fight again and then retreat
where as #hilda# is like okay retreat then you go to the bush then you work out work out and exercise <malay>minum</malay> protein <malay>semua</malay>
then you go into the field full health
<malay>itu lagi macam</malay>
but I need to practise #hilda# I so so scared <malay>dia orang pun</malay> debuff #hilda# [eh] cause it's like legit a lot of players are playing #hilda#
why why do they ban uranus though I mean like he's such a
he's such an undervalued hero being played in low rank then when you go meet ranks suddenly <malay>dia orang</malay> ban <malay>macam tak</malay> make sense [lah]
unless
no [lah] [ah] ya it doesn't make sense but besides uranus <malay>dia orang</malay> ban <malay>siapa</malay> like basic gusion
worse [eh]
(um)
is it the ban benedetta
I think
what is the new ban like new players
I thought it has always been three heroes being ban
[oh] [ah] [lah] actually cause I think only the last
two hero last two players of the team gets to choose who to ban is it
[oh] no wonder then
(mm) then I guess #hilda# is might be my next choice in
buying
with my poor twenty four K coins left because I don't have savings in a game account I mean why who would do that
who why why would you [oh] ya cause they don't know how to play new hero
[oh] cause did not admit cause <malay>dia orang tak baca dia orang tak tahu baca dia orang suka</malay> smash smash button <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>entah masuk</malay> meeting <malay>macam mana itu</malay> kidding [lah]
or am I
(mm) but anyways besides
a tank
speaking about a tank
<malay>nak buat apa dengan kita punya</malay> container tank <malay>itu</malay> [eh]
I mean staycation is in january tho

he's already boosting my company okay cause like dude he is like always grabbing like he really don't mind spending twenty six dollar on himself just to grab
it's cause he feel bad that I didn't get a grab home
like earlier that was earlier
and like I'm not the one who has to work
at night so I don't know why he so
adamant into
like paying for my grab
<malay>aku aku nak</malay> split <malay>pun dia tak kasi</malay>
so
so (err) we compromise so then he pay for hair he pay all
no [lah] not twenty seven he pay for the

one of those
one of those what you call that [one] [ah] sports bag

because if we are bringing our rice cooker again I need my suitcase
okay okay since we're not gonna bring rice cooker [kan]
but you say you need rice you need your rice then we have all the
so they have pots and pans then
is it safe to say that we can
cook rice in the pot and pan
like a natural rice cooker we do it natural way even though it's electric fire but still
and then I can
I can blend my <malay>nasi gorengnya</malay> my <malay>nasi gorengnya</malay> what is it called <malay>apa itu</malay> (um)

okay wait wait #haizat# don't eat spicy [ah]
[oh] my god
<malay>nanti</malay> you take over cause I might just end up
seeing a lot of negativity about him
ya I feel like I'm just I'm just like talking bad about that all the way
but did I lie
I did not
so
it's facts be [ah] I did sidetracked but it's not like
[oh] and do you know that he is he is
do you saw the who who and the care bear thing right
okay do you know that he's actually
he fully endorsed her to wear both
cause he say it's cute
and then he say can he say he say he don't mind wearing also
I am and I I'm I I'm like
you gonna spend eighty five dollars on a care bear <malay>punya baju</malay> okay wait if you want to buy the <malay>baju</malay> just the <malay>baju</malay> and then you wear like jeans
I mean I mean if you're happy if you happy that ya go go ahead
but you want to you want to get the shorts as well then
I don't know I just have the urge to throw a rock at you
and then I told him
if you really don't mind wearing that care bear shirt [oh] my god I'm side tracking if you don't mind wearing that care bear
[kan]
you one day when we and we meet who who
but we don't tell her that
that you bored but you wear you wear both set like the shirt and the pants I will pay
then we meet who who now want to see I want to see these two
these two species in their own natural habitat and how they interact cause like I don't understand
why why why would you spend on that care bear <malay>baju</malay> and then wear outside
but why would you also spend so much just to wear inside of your house so obviously you'll be wearing outside at some point [kan]
but the shorts you got to go though
the shorts is a no no
okay I'm side tracking back
I'm just letting you know that
#haizat# agrees
with the care bear <malay>baju</malay> and <malay>seluar</malay>
and I cannot imagine him wearing it cause he have very long legs so it's going to look extra
extra
weird on him I don't know I imagine spongebob <malay>kaki pakai</malay> care bear shorts
!whoa! you're only questioning it now dude you should have been [oh] okay and another thing he he actually also agree that you and him are like two peas in a pod
I don't know ya actually you guys are [oh] my god ya you guys are just that ya different taste one K pop one is like I don't know western artists I guess
why am I the only different one why am I always the one that is just meeting either one of you !huh! what is this can you all please

I am the the glue to
what are you two (um)
amoebas
okay wait so
before they I don't know where we're going with this but
going back to our stay cay plans part two
(err) okay first day <malay>kita</malay> check in then <malay>lepas</malay> check in
[eh] no no first day <malay>lepas dah</malay> pack
then we meet up earlier cause I know #haizat# won't be sleeping
then we have lunch then after lunch we check in
then <malay>lepas dah</malay> check in
then we put our stuff
then I'm pretty sure we're going to be like !wah! look at the bed
!wah! look at the sofa !wah! look at the dining table so after we're amazed by literally everything and anything then
(mm) I'm quite concerned because #haizat# haven't slept or rest yet
so I think
I think we can save to say <malay>kita</malay> rest
first on the first day
then after resting on the first day
dinner <malay>kita makan luar</malay> like around the area just get the feel of
the feel of where we are
then <malay>lepas itu</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> (um)
we can go container gym
but I think I would rather just go back to the container and we just
take in the feel of how it feels like to be living in a container
no I think okay since before that right like on the first day <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>dah lepas makan</malay>
then <malay>kita</malay> rest <malay>balik dekat</malay> container then the gym is not that far then I'd rather we just gym at night
then because I feel that we're the type of people who actually stay up night to just talk about anything also so can we at least like keep a limit we we keep it like three then we sleep like
five hours no need go gym in the morning [lah] I rather gym at night also I think we're all gymers at night
[oh] wait <malay>tapi kau takut kau takut kau takut</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau nak pergi</malay> okay okay <malay>pagi</malay> let's go <malay>pagi</malay> gym <malay>pagi</malay> gym <malay>aku lupa</malay> sorry

<malay>nak tak</malay>
okay okay so
ya [lah] like you imagine we play
(um) musical chair but this [one] is musical container
then like you run one round right then maybe me and #haizat# play first like whoever we scissor paper stone then one person go out then we chase you then after that one round I go back in then #haizat#
we scissor paper stone and then
whoever <malay>kalah</malay> then must go out chase you again then go back in then we on replay [oh] <malay>itu dah</malay> cardio <malay>dah fuyoh</malay>
okay what I can feel because today we gym at nine right
the waking up is quite a
quite a weight [ah]
and not only that right [eh] how do I feel when I woke up (um)
I think <malay>aku</malay> quite relax
like quite #ons# to start my day [leh]
is that
<malay>tapi aku macam lepas aku dah</malay> gym I really need to shower
did I shower after I gym [oh] ya I did I did I did shower did I I did

I'm a clean
human being
[oh] wait (um) so after after day one what what what's day two
no no I can already tell where this is going
<malay>lepas</malay> trampoline park [kan] <malay>dah</malay> sweaty sweaty <malay>semua</malay> the first thing that we're going to come out of #haizat# mouth is let's grab back [ah] I mean wait wait wait wait trampoline park <malay>dekat mana</malay>
I think it's town area
okay but if we're
okay [lah] I mean I don't mind grabbing there first cause like if we're about to I think I'd rather we just like wake up early then start our day early [lah] then <malay>macam</malay>
just
instead of grabbing there just take public transport [lah] I mean like not that one hour journey and (uh) and (uh) how how much is that twenty six dollars I I I think one hour journey I I mean it's it's okay
(um) okay [lah] I get okay you know [what] how about
I am so #ons# if we're just going to stay in the container all the way so I mean this going out thing is actually #haizat# plan [eh]
wait wait do you want to go out of the container I already ask you that but I feel like I already know the answer because I know you
okay wait but we can we can go outside if we
how do I say if the places are nearby [lah] but if the place not nearby then I can we have a second suggestion cause I'd rather the place nearby
and
(um) <malay>tak payah</malay> grab cause grab spend extra money I mean like this #haizat# he do you know that his grab account is platinum
I haven't I've never went past gold like I know like I know my limits
(mm) but
I think we can one one place I know is cow play cow moo which is quite near one of I mean [eh] no no that's promenade right
I take it back I don't know where is one-north is what is my workplace all we have is laboratories
I don't know I don't know
if you go by circle line then far [lah] cause like one-north promenade is like other end to other end [leh]
I but I think the journey is like forty five minutes max
we talking about food are we going to cook all the way I would rather cook all the way I mean I don't mind eating maggi
I mean come on #samyang# man I mean (uh)
no brainer answer #samyang# all the way to cook #samyang#
that's like
if aliens were to find me or catch me they open up my stomach they're just going to find #samyang# no those are not my intestine those are my #samyangs#
wait where am I going with this so besides #samyang# what else to eat are we going to eat all the way inside or are we just going to cook
once in a while some more maggi is like
#haizat# don't even eat spicy so
even maggi is quite limited for him
[oh] ya Mcdonald that's like the only cheapest food that I know and it's really nearby
one-north
yup okay
so I think food wise should be fine some of us will go shopping before that
(mm) then what are you guys shopping for shampoo <malay>air air</malay> our fridge is big though [oh] no no no we definitely need ice cream okay we'll definitely going to squeeze in food we'll definitely going to squeeze in (um) netflix and ice cream night
yes and we're going to fight over what movie to watch [eh] if #haizat# were to pull that lady gaga movie I have no words I will I'd rather watch
no all of your guys have no taste <malay>takde</malay> trust just kidding my taste is just
weak [lah]
you all don't watch cartoon I watch cartoon [oh] wait you watch winx club
I'm so glad I'm not the lowest at the bottom of the food chain
tasteless
[oh] wait I just exposed to other people that you are watching winx club that's right #siti farhanah#
watches winx club and she's twenty four years old guys
[eh] since when I say I watch spongebob I don't watch spongebob I only watch their memes
they are meme materials
and that it's acceptable
no no no I swear <malay>aku tak tengok</malay> spongebob it's really by memory based
(err) but to argue that I did watch but <malay>itu bila itu macam</malay> like
like <malay>lima tahun kau punya</malay> winx club <malay>satu tahun pun tak boleh</malay> I'm pretty sure you watch winx club recently I don't even know why you watch winx club okay [lah] I won't judge you then at least you don't watch my little pony if you do I will judge
I will roast you from hell to back
I can go all the way it's okay no it's it's it's for it's fine if you want to watch my little pony by these people who watches my little pony they are there's a certain
there's a how do I say there's a this weird weird
(um) group there were just (uh) my little pony and (err) I don't think ponies are supposed to doodle stuff so ya I'm judging the that specific group that those they do note that that's not horseback riding right there that no no no no there is something else
no no no it's not the cartoon it's the people watching the cartoon they changed the cartoon and made it inappropriate that's what I was talking about
okay so I guess that's the end

<malay>makanan apakah yang akan anda pilih</malay>
[oh] period

because #mala# the <malay>rempah dia sama tapi</malay> like the ingredients you can switch it up you know what I mean
so everyday you're eating like different
ingredients but still the same base
I like I like I want to try mexican food though
like authentic ones
my friends in school like now school
like I've been talking to
like some of them like
having daily conversations with them on Whatsapp
like <malay>macam</malay> this guy
his <malay>dia melayu dia</malay>
<malay>nama dia</malay> #zul#
he's twenty four this year so basically like he went to the he like he went he went to the route [lah]
so his life is basically like just moving around you know like
he lived in (um) #abu dhabi# then he came back in singapore he lived like multiple
houses in like through singapore like from the west to the east to the north
ya
then now
you know his his life is just so interesting because he
he does a lot of things and he was from then he keep he keeps telling us about like his stories
ya I told you before like he's the he's pretty short for a guy then after that like
a lot of the people in the like they always look down on him [ah] not look down [lah] like <malay>macam</malay>
tease him
<malay>macam cakap</malay> !ee! <malay>ketot</malay> then after that he cried you know [oh] my god
ya and no the thing is that he was telling us the whole story then like you know guys being guys
they'll be like [eh] <malay>kenapa kau kau nangis aku tak faham gitu</malay>
like
but for him I feel like
he's more of a emotional kind of like softy [ah] I would say
ya he's a nice guy
then (um) I
(mm)
that [one] #zul# then I have like this study group
(um) there's
there's a total of six of us four four guys then two girls
like me and the cheryl girl [lah] then the the guys
one is one is a mix of japanese indian
but he knows how you talk in malay like
damn good damn fluent
then I ask him at first like [eh] you sure you not malay [ah] cause he looks like malay also
like from from my first impression then he say no
I I chinese indian japanese I
like
he's so ya but
sad [lah] because the the parents divorce so like he didn't really get to
mingle
what
green
what happened to it
thank you I want Nalgene please
ya because that that bottle
that bottle is basically a Nalgene
no I don't care it's only ten dollars
!aww!
so who's water bottle are you going to borrow now
exactly that was your water bottle
what happened to the pink Nalgene [ah] it's missing also
ya the hot pink was mine
(mm)
[oh] then one of my guy friends like
he very funny [ah] but like suddenly he
he said guys I'm tired of this
(err) life he he was talking to us like face to face [ah] like guys like
every single time we meet him he would always say !wah! I cannot I really want to drop out but then in the end he really dropped out
like one day before our maths test
and he's so funny
that's not even pulling through it's not even one semester
[oh] my god like
ya ya ya ya
he said like !wah! I really cannot take it
like it's always at the back of my mind he said like dropping out
and like some more he but okay [lah] he's job hunting
but the fact that he wants to work as a swabber
at his own like part time place it's just funny but
no like it's something for him to start up with [lah]
but
I say <malay>tapi kau rugi</malay> because
his whole tuition fee has been sponsored by MENDAKI <malay>apa</malay>
so <malay>kirakan</malay> it's like free education and you could just going to like
let it go just like that
so wasted [lah]
ya I mean that's my motivation that's my only motivation
as of now
I should have studied culinary arts
according to my friend he said that his friend
is studying culinary arts right now
in so what they do is that every single day
they have to cook and they have like
like their modules (um) module grades are based on how they perform [lah]
in the kitchen like their conduct
all of that
then <malay>dia orang punya</malay> written test also like he say is not that hard
whose that
#waalaikumusalam#
<malay>kejap</malay>
#sasun# you want
he was out with his friends
cycling
<malay>sampai</malay> I don't know because I took a nap from five
from where
but you get tired from socialising from your boyfriend
being socially present and active
does it mean that it's hard for you to
to build a conversation with them or you rather like you just rather not
there's nothing wrong with that [what]
[oh] it's not a stereotype [ah] it's actually a real thing
I think engineering school is pretty mute
discussions for every tutorial [oh] my god you know
[oh] my god
my tutorials are just paper
on paper it's just assignments [ah] basically
I'm so fed up with my programming group
that guy was really
like putting up a fit man
like his attitude was just [oh] my god
like because (err) one of my group member
like he action do
like <malay>macam</malay> he thinks that he knows how to code
but in reality he doesn't know [lah] but he's the type of
person who believes that
whatever effort you put in is you all going to be worried I don't care about the grades
then I'm like here thinking no I need the grades because that's the only point I mean that's the only
reason
like why I want to hire someone else [lah] to do the code then he say no he doesn't want
then in the end we cannot like proceed with the hiring [ah] like outsourcing because it needs the
like mutual agreement [what]
in the group
so it's just
me and cheryl against him and another guy
[oh] my god
ya so he said it's okay if we get C
man like at this point
ya
and now he's doing (uh) the code all by himself
I don't even know what's going on you know programming computer programming ya
that's part of engineering
to what colour
no at this point my hair is dying
no I just don't want to
like you know now is already dry
don't you feel like when you're when you're
when your hair is coloured like it's very fragile
dye your hair no you liar
so there was something [lah]
do you regret
if I were to dye my hair
I'd dye
I want green man
there's just something about green
depends on what shades though
[oh] that bright one [ah] I prefer the
very is dark
but it's on a lighter shade
(hmm)
poor man
ya very often
<malay>tapi</malay> now
I mean we don't really like celebrate it celebrate it
it's not that special of an occasion
what's that
mother dough
what do they sell croissants
is it like is it better than that #tiong bahru# bakery

I think you guys should've like incorporated those old school <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>lagu</malay> like (um) #lagus# that they reminisce to instead of like now
<malay>punya</malay> trends
that's what I feel
but like all of them chinese is it
or is it a mix
you could have asked your chinese friends
okay what what what do you want the outcome to be just them doing TikTok and enjoy
but are foods provided
[oh] I get it I
think christmas [eh]
think it's pretty hard [eh] considering there's like no physical interaction
I mean it'll be it'll be more meaningful if there's physical interaction
!aww!

ya okay
so
(um) not mine hers
it's about a situation
so basically she she is confused if the guy that she's talking to right now is just a friend or someone that she is she is willing to pursue
until they die
okay you talk talk talk to me okay talk to me
so okay so what happened is this fella send him a photo okay so let me just talk to you okay cause I scared they will like not accept us if we talk to them so okay so number one
please accept me
<malay>kejap</malay> okay <malay>tak apa</malay> if he were to send you a gift that is a bloody portrait
portrait malay portrait of you
!oi! if he send you a portrait
it's sus it's very suspicious
any human being that were to do something that is out of the norm
that is going way
bro has he ever met you before
at that point of time no so we we shall stick to no okay so
ultimate red flags a normal person will say hi
not send you a bloody picture
you've never met him before how why is he investing so much time sus sus that is sus
have you ever ask him have you done this to another girl before
a lame ass will do that I'm sorry straight up
(um) cancel the recording
exactly let's be real if
okay we had we had a very bad history where we were at (uh) one of our lowest point of our lives where we we we don't really (um)
check and (um) keep ourself in check in in terms of morals but that is in the past you've used guys before okay so don't act as if you don't even
feel like it's very weird for you to do something without even knowing them fully
you see a damn guy you like their attention but you don't want them what the hell do you do go above and beyond because you don't give a shit about the feelings correct
why is this fella going above and beyond when he doesn't even know you that is red flag because that means you don't even you go with
head first
without thinking about the qualities and stuff like that
has he ever dated before
the fact that you're not mature enough to understand that relationships can go downhill quickly and you still
desperately want to go into a a a a a
not you the fella the fella the fact that you've already
the fact that he was already in a relationship before yet he still not cautious
to be in a relationship in his future relationship that explains a lot where is the maturity
I take my time also but I I
you have to put that shit aside bro
why you talking about him okay K K K K
then make friends
have fun
!wah! ya I can vouch for that
ya actually you're not interested
(mm)
am I right to even assume if this is how he's behaving right now
if
<malay>kalau betul</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>tiba-tiba kau dengan dia</malay> together malay malay if <malay>kalau betul kau dengan dia</malay> together
and if if this is like a (uh) continuous pattern
where if you all fight you want to settle with that kind of guy
correct so do you want to make the same mistake
babe
correct so
baby girl
but
listen first stop first he's the first guy that you've ever asked out to ask to go out and then secondly
bullshit
I ask you simple
pressure
but that's the thing I feel like if you've used people before you should already have that confidence
understand what I'm saying to be smart about it I'm your friend but I'm hitting on you
no you know that that's that's how life is what okay so life is don't judge me I I'm right so if you think I'm wrong keep your opinions to yourself I'm kidding no as in
this doesn't match he takes his time knowing someone he sends a portrait to someone doesn't make sense
if you take your bloody ass time you already invest so much and and he
you know the games [lah] bro
can okay no no no no no
this is one of the major mistakes that most of my friends make
you date someone you know nothing about them once you start dating them when you already
you but you're you correct is good that you're not dating them but you never you're not even getting to know them
no getting to know them in terms of how do you deal with relationship not about the family and stuff like that
because that don't mean shit some people out from like fucked up families but they still know how to handle relationships and how to prioritise that and also
ya that's why I tell you be a friend once you be a friend the person is vulnerable enough you are not
you are the piece of shit in the no you
denial
stop the recording
<malay>dah dah dah dah</malay> that's right (err)
understand or not
ya understand you just that
do you hear the crickets
taking it slow
that's why you just all out flirt
a lot of flirt
please [lah] muslim or not as in if you are or not the the
no correct no I'm not saying in terms of flirt when you're with him touch here all these that's the fucking boundary but if if you are texting show that you like
understand show that you like
say just say listen if that that's what I'm saying people
tend to think that if you are my friend I treat you differently
how the fuck do even become your friend then no listen listen no you listen
when you talk to him like a friend that is when you get to be your most vulnerable self
and the flirting turns into like is a conversation how I talk to all my other friends so <malay>kalau</malay> if if <malay>kalau kau tengah berbual dengan dia</malay> and <malay>kau kau macam</malay> just <malay>cakap</malay>
[eh] <malay>kau kelakar</malay> [seh] <malay>aku suka berbual dengan kau</malay>
that is a playful thing correct
but at the same time it will bond you guys together because he has affirmation that [eh] she loves my company
that means I'm I'm I'm secured enough to just bring it one step forward so you're not even doing that you dumb-ass you're not even texting him
that you send a portrait ya it's weird
[ah] see [lah] all the bullshit all come out
cannot cannot cannot they say cannot be distracted [mah] so you pull out your memory cannot cannot nevermind it's okay
exactly why are you talking as if you are his girlfriend
what that is how you talk when you're want to see how is that
what
what you talking about
correct because I don't want to fuck you that's why you no no don't don't later they will disqualify us listen this what I'm telling you
you just like what I say use your flirting skills when he say that kind of stuff
when he say that kind of stuff that is when you should tell him
ya exactly so why you not talking to me that is a flirt you leave the person like [eh] !siala! why she talk like that she want me flirt to her [ah] (oo) #la# #la# so that's when <malay>kalau kau dah cakap macam asal kau tak berbual dengan aku</malay> ya exactly <malay>kau tak nak berbual aku</malay> [pe] <malay>kau</malay> busy <malay>sangat</malay> [pe] I'm not that important
it's a joke right if you say I'm just his friend but you know deep down you've ulterior motive correct so
you say that shit when you are in a freaking relationship you sound like a married woman
who the hell says that
to what to your thoughts [ah] denial
okay <malay>dengar dulu</malay> so after you're in a relationship that after that your partner if they say is it weird <malay>dah dah dah</malay>
even if you're in a relationship you wouldn't fucking say that you will say that I think we should plan a day that is special for us and just go out cause I know you've been very busy
you don't just say I know you're busy [lah] so it's fine K stop [oh] shit that means she doesn't want to talk to me
you know what I'm saying that that is the flaw in you and you want say like I have I have I got you want I pull out the receipt or not don't need to pull out keep it in your damn pocket
laugh laugh some more
(um)
and then sorry it's just me farting
then then do some other shit [lah] bro like
ya ya you have to
no <malay>tak</malay> when you meet him
question him why did you send me the portrait when you don't know me then after that question him do you do this to other girls before that how did you meet your first girlfriend
who else have you send this shit to we might not know for
for a fact he just play these games and those those previous girls reject him
we might not know sorry any guy who does that immediate rejection for me
no you have no self-worth if you do that you have no self-worth
shut the hell up men who are too nice manipulative
are you kidding me bro I have been manipulated that's why
!huh! okay K K I agree I was shaking my head just now
what you mean
in what sense is this a joke like he's he's like playful to you that that is what you mean by that's bullshit shut the fuck up go and stop stop being so fucking blinded really really
twenty twenty
expensive [what]
still can get blind
being a blind ass bitch
ya [lah] if never take care [lor]
ya ridiculous unless you like sixty and then want to die soon [lah]
I want to see the world clearly before I die so I take my last breath make sure my eye open
stupid joy I kidding joy if you are listening to this I don't mean what I say
okay going back
so don't be an idiot
[ah] sorry [lah] it's fucking sus [lah] it's sus very sus very very sus
ya no because to me is like you want to live in denial
if you don't like him I don't mind but you already ask him out
and not even ya like I said if ten years down the road you ask your boyfriend can I meet him your boyfriend ask how did you met meet him he sent me a bloody portrait he knows for sure this fella was head over heels for you he's not going to get you near him
no [lah] for what drink tea
don't be a fucking idiot you're a fucking idiot
maybe maybe that's why that's why he keep saying that like [oh] that's why we [ah] got gap got gap if you are fucking twenty three you're twenty three right if you're twenty three you have that kind of mindset who raised you
like gap [lah] <malay>macam</malay> he probably thinks that <malay>kau macam lagi kaya</malay> or some shit like that right
I know prior to that he keep saying <malay>macam</malay>
you are just
correct so why why must you say that that means you are not working hard enough for you to fulfil yourself in terms of confidence
what is it is it that you are a if he get you then what the he climb up the tier is it which is disgusting [what] right
acting [eh] <malay>macam kau</malay> self-realisation <malay>padahal tak ada apa-apa habuk pun takde</malay>
no like is it like <malay>macam</malay> is it
like a a are you a trophy which okay I'm not saying that
then why does he speak like that
how is the previous girl let's be what is the previous girlfriend like how is she
the previous girlfriend
so how many years and when was it
eighteen nineteen is
no it's not young it's not young what are you talking about it's like
a relationship okay a question okay so how did he got with the girl how did he get with the girl
some app what app
muslim
sus
what the fuck [oh] my god
[oh] my god why wait what it's just let to me specific Tinder <malay>atau</malay> (uh) Okcupid
I've I've use it before ya so I have a strong judgement
Muzmatch is muslim
he use he use muslim one [ah]
okay a lot of vulnerable people
so
the fact that he
Muzmatch is good there's a lot of (um) naive girls because you really really go through <malay>macam</malay>
to to the tee <malay>punya macam</malay> this [one] really my mother and my father must know if I go out date with you must bring you home must tell mummy daddy that is okay that's fine if you have the maturity of
we're going to go out on dates and if I were to speak to you it's official
like there's no such grey fucking area of
(hmm) I'm the friend but I ask him out he's the first ever guy that asked me out so no but it's real so
that that's why to me you've went out with a girl
you've been cheated on you went on the app [lah] correct right
and then after that now you behave in this very desperate manner maybe because to me so many other guys don't fucking do that but obviously
him he's weird
okay so the girl is what religious also
how why and why
how can you be friends with a friend that dated you and send you a bloody portrait
who's #amin# which guy
#amin# <malay>abeh</malay> #amin#
okay ya what's up with him
which is still sus to me
right now it's fine listen it's fine because you're single
it's not fine once you have a boyfriend
correct ya this shit will end bro it will end if you really love your boyfriend you will listen to your boyfriend hundred percent if your boyfriend say <malay>tak nak kau</malay> you won't <malay>kau tak akan</malay> break up <malay>dengan mata air kau</malay> just to <malay>lepak dengan budak</malay> #syafiq# <malay>ni</malay> that means you're saying that this fella is much more important than that guy
you are giving yourself a lot of bullshit
but you're single so it's fine
can
can but
if your correct if if if shit gets comfortable then you say I just want to hang with my friends then your boyfriend say [ah] <malay>buat apa</malay>
<malay>sorang-sorang buat apa</malay>
is there drama now with you and #amin#
okay so he got say that he's over you and he's not dating another person or did he give like some vague answer
why
so you friendzone him
so what do you like him
no back then
babe you fucking weird
you fucking weird because once you have a guy these are not your friends anymore you are just making yourself lose friendship serious
serious
then you won't lose him but you will lose other guys that you've dated before I would never let my guy
get close to any motherfuckers any girls that ever fucking went out with him
okay I'm not possessive [ah] listen [ah] okay I have my boundaries but it's just weird
let me ask you now
which is weirder bro
if you have a boyfriend
now I ask you he say okay I go out with a girl I've dated before with another girl that is there
how would you feel exactly my point you cannot be very oblivious about this thing you're going to lose friendship you are already losing it bro
you have to pick your battle choose one what the fuck
because this is my criteria to my my boyfriend
correct obviously you can say but think about the long run you're going to lose them either ways
so no that's why no that's why to me is
to me right if my I I just I give this
I'm very liberal it doesn't sound like throughout this recording but okay
when my partner were to tell me [oh] I'm talking to this fella (um)
and then after I say okay (um)
how did you meet her
and then after that [oh] through Instagram
this girl is trying to get to know me immediate no because to me
you can what is friends is if got fate make it
(uh) fate [eh] that you and this girl fucking one out of how many billion people in the entire world but you
physically met that that fella you all had conversations you all click she was there at your lowest when she was there at your lowest she gave you time
give you motivation to bring you up when you were a piece of motherfucking shit
#platonically# as friends
I cannot touch because that person was there for you I'm eternally grateful
you can hang but I must also be introduced and that that fella also then that's the part where where once I'm in I give the green light I meet the girl and I need to see for myself
if she has any ulterior motive because let's be real anybody that we date were
people who are possible candidates right why didn't I I date you
because I don't like you <malay>atau</malay> you don't like me either ways there was something more than a friend you give me no fucking purpose you give me money <malay>aku kasi</malay> (uh) I <malay>aku kasi kau berbual dengan dia dia tak bayar kau duit</malay>
<malay>atau dia bagi kau</malay> knowledge <malay>dia tak bagi kau</malay> opportunities in life get the fuck out because I'm your fucking best friend cause to me is like
you are playing with fire you let your partner date hang with a girl that they dated before
you are just going to lose lose what if one day you argue with your partner then after that he go and text the girl
and then after that the girl say ya for what also you want to talk to her it's just going to add it's fucking toxic unless you become friends with the the
no no such thing as date sorry for me is bullshit because you all she didn't give you any benefit let's be real people are selfish and you know your own motives if you don't like that girl that girl probably likes you why must she even give hope to that fella
to that girl even if she date already [what] then her boyfriend don't give her the self-respect [meh] to like just cut off guys that she date before right
so the thing is you need to be and [ah] if you want to talk about F (uh) [ah] friends friends I got a lot of friends #lan jiao# [lah] must be one of them must be your date [meh]
like you don't have any workmates [meh] you don't you're not motivated in life
to have any fucking goals to be busy with other shit than to <malay>lepak</malay>
no you are single so it's fine but you already setting yourself
for hell basically because no [lah] it's bullshit [lah] if your partner do that to you I I mean you can take it [meh]
no because you don't give a shit
which is even more weird because but is weird because then what if you're giving him hope and
if okay a guy that I
correct and the fact that he still wants to stay when you give nos no purpose at all
so doesn't fucking prove anything like you don't give him money you don't give him time you don't give him knowledge
you make him laugh for fuck
correct correct you make him laugh you make him laugh and for fuck that just makes him even more attracted and loves your company which makes your boyfriend feel a bit what the fuck
why are you making other guys laugh especially the guy that pursued you before
so same thing if if if my guy
I'm not gonna lie I I'm I was insecure but now I don't give a fucking shit because a lot of girls
texted him like I really had to go through that shit especially when my my relationship back then was was private
I had to go through that shit and I learnt that actually
if my the
you shouldn't get angry at people who date your boyfriend you should get angry at your boyfriend for not knowing how to act if you act this way you think your boyfriend will be
would would not get mad with you [meh] he will get mad [what] <malay>pasal kau dah kau dah pernah berbual dengan dorang</malay> and and the way that your and your boyfriend will probably be pissed off because
the way that he get to know you is probably the same way that these motherfuckers did
he's not gonna be and this is bullshit [eh] if let's say you went out with this fella and with
#syafiq# the one that you never date what #amin# #syafiq# okay so #amin# is the one you date before
so if you went out with #amin# and #syafiq# okay if your boyfriend were to say nevermind at the end of the day she comes back home to me
let's not be fucking stupid humans will interfere with your relationship humans can just say any fucking shit I've met so many guys that desperately wants my hot girlfriend relationship to fucking break
so they pretend to be that guy friend that is close to that girl and then he's not not for you [ah] [eh] just break up [ah]
then after they get close date which is I know motive girls guys I don't
hate on anyone but if you are stupid on your actions that's the part where I have to call that bullshit [eh] like bro what the fuck you doing you know and I'm not saying that you are stupid obviously you're not is the guy the guy is stupid because
if #syafiq# keeps telling you [eh] <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] when the first meeting problem starts with [eh] I didn't before [sia] there's there's gonna be this part of like
[eh] I got talk to her before I got date her before [oh] now she talking to that guy [ah]
sad or it's weird sorry it's weird
to him for him
(mm) [ah] you (mm) [ah] (mm) (mm)
because you are you trying to say that [oh] he's just a friend which is not like if if your partner ya you say that your partner do the same thing you're not gonna accept it
and then you want to ya [lah] me
that's why I'm telling you this this this fella is not a friend so you have to this #syafiq# [eh] no #akim# guy #akim# #akim# you need to just
play your game well just say [lor] like
flirt to text not to sext
I would say because <malay>dia</malay> very religious [kan] <malay>kau</malay> just <malay>cakap macam</malay> just playfully flirt [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
things that make him feel like [oh] she really wants my attention like [eh] <malay>kau tak berbual dengan aku</malay> [eh] <malay>dah lama tak rindu</malay> [seh] or something like that so
it's not <malay>haram</malay> [what] I mean okay it is <malay>haram</malay> because you have the intention but then
to make it quick to because you don't have any balls to be like can we just date cause I know you like me no desperate motherfucker would send me a portrait so [ah] shit I still cannot get it out of my system
that's weird as fuck so like he
you straight up ask him you got send any other girl portraits or not
if you're not if he say like you sound like you're jealous shut the fuck up weird fuck you are the one who's fucking weird so you tell me now do you send any girl's portrait
and is not sense of controlling it's because you know
how humans manipulate and the things that they do sometimes if a guy were to slap your face they come back they apologise give you ten thousand ring you will say okay the effort is there
people go through that shit so I don't want you to be [eh] he send me that gift is a good gesture I can also say I send you fucking ten apples good gesture you eat that shit is rotten [what] right
so you need to understand I know I have three I have three boys in my house
all of them are motherfuckers back then I know all the fucking tricks that are up their sleeve it's so easy to
here's the thing
when you get close to a guy they start to become vulnerable the real side of them come out so when the real side of them come out that's easy for them to be like K #chao#
you know what I'm saying so if you like if you start to feel like you're agitated and you like him and you start to miss him
make it happen when you guys are dating so that when the red flag comes you are not in a relationship for you to just like if you are in a relationship you cannot let go [what]
but if you're dating you can let go right so
so many of my friends are ya officially dating this guy
and that is fine because we are dating [mah] officially you're officially dating so
ya some people date two to three people ya that is using [ah] but
some people that date their their their partner officially it it it gives
how to say [ah] people will lie to impress you so you need to be smart [lah] for me for me is like
I don't like people who lie I don't like people who chase after me I don't like people who like <malay>macam</malay> step (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> [eh] (uh) like you can flirt [lah] but then like
at least have the sense of (um) intelligence when you talk to me because if you if you're trying to say that (uh) you are insecure or whatnot sorry go to a fucking therapist I cannot fix that
<malay>faham tak</malay> it's so many red flags sorry but
[eh] [eh] (uh) no if I were you
I would further <malay>macam</malay> I would pursue him
for me to find out more red flags
so
!wah!
still not exact
ya just ask all the fucking shit as if you are you are interested in him
<malay>faham tak</malay> so <malay>bila kau dah macam</malay> together <malay>dengan dia</malay> not not if let's say he starts to
if there's this intense heat where he feels like okay maybe she's the one [ah] like I like her morals and stuff like that and she shows some some interest to me I think I should date her
so then when once he say that and you say okay
pattern all come out
weird bro portrait the fuck
like it's either you are a good boy <malay>atau</malay> you are manipulative
it's weird
it's weird bro
imagine [eh] if you didn't you don't get with him
you get with your boyfriend that is way more fucking secure
he will shit on this motherfucker bro
for real !huh! <malay>dia hantar</malay> you portrait <malay>kimak budak-budak kental</malay> [pe] [sia] confirm <malay>aku cakap dengan kau</malay>
obviously you want a guy that chase after you but not a guy who doesn't fucking know you
what what if he does this behind your back don't know that girl fucking pretty send her portrait while he's with you
it's weird [what] it's fucking weird bro
you <malay>kena</malay> cheated also [eh] we might know he's fucking seeing girls now we don't know
I'm not trying to (uh) anyhow to do [ah] but
through the Muzmatch also
just catch up is it
this was how old
[oh] so his relationship was like three years [ah]
#pukiwek# three years <malay>abeh kena</malay> cheated [eh] !siala!
with the first girl
#kiwek# okay [lah]
then he got single then he dated that girl
(uh huh)
I need to know the timeline so initially she said that she wants this this this this they went out how many times
correct have to ask all that babe because
this will all boils down to who he is as a person so ya okay continue
no [lah] with the insecurities bullshit
to marry is it
but that's not the important thing
correct so number one if she were to ask you need to ask how many times did you guys did you guys went out so she already so if she state it before she went out that I want this type of guy
[oh] so she state it when
okay okay then
correct (um) so she went out with that guy not telling him the expectations
(um)
but whenever they go out she got say she what she like what she don't like
you need to ask for details so if he is the type of man that is like <malay>macam</malay>
which is to me that is the right way to be in a relationship so if he's complaining
fucking buck up [ah] bro like if if that girl don't if she wants to be treated as a proper muslim I don't want to be in a in a dark setting cause anything can happen I cannot see shit I don't want to be in this (uh) this setting we're just together
then if you like her do whatever it takes it shows you as a person
that basic that's basic I should not applaud him for that
ya basic babe no you know why
no because you not from Muzmatch [mah]
right so Muzmatch I have a friend
<malay>kawan aku</malay> legit <malay>bila aku kecil-kecil</malay> [kan] <malay>dia memang betul</malay> religious <malay>habis</malay> the family and very <malay>baik</malay> so
shy <malay>baik</malay> and are religious so she she talk to guys from Muzmatch Muzmatch because she's shy to talk to guys in real life and she's also very religious so is very scary [lah] for you to just <malay>macam</malay> socialise [what]
then (um)
she's the type that don't even wear <malay>tudung depan</malay> (uh) <malay>pakcik makcik</malay>
so legit [eh] <malay>ada orang datang pakai tudung pakai tudung</malay> that kind of thing <malay>atau macam</malay>
[eh] (uh) <malay>berbual pun baik macam budi bahasa macam lembut</malay> so when when she go out with these kind of (uh) men (uh)
I know her standards like you need to ask ya like I like that she go go out on a date also
but fucking wary of
(um) <malay>pasal</malay> everyday they remind themselves [ah] [oh] <malay>jin selalu ada kalau tempat dua-dua berduaan jin cepat masuk</malay> that's fucking true let's be real <malay>macam</malay> and and that's why to me
(um) (uh) asking parents for for take that is the norm of how a muslim
especially a daughter
so I shouldn't applaud you for that because
you put yourself in Muzmatch [what] you should know the criteria [what] as a man also you should lead your family one day then you have this kind of thing then after that want to complain you cannot complain [what] because if you don't get the girl then shut up [lah] so
in my head is like (um) if she already said that I want this this this this you you shouldn't complain cause if that's not the type of girl the ratio of the halal and <malay>haram</malay> is not for you
deep bro because then you're just wasting your damn time
<malay>kau masih nak</malay> try try try <malay>tapi kau tak</malay> up there then how nobody's asking you for a lot of money people asking you for respect towards the girl so this is (um)
how do I say this [ah] everytime I give my friend benefit of the doubt I'm always right so <malay>macam</malay>
get to know him give him the benefit of the doubt
eventually will come true whatever I say maybe because whether it was lame maybe that's why <malay>sekarang ni dia macam cakap ni cakap tu</malay> so if she she say she don't want it then <malay>kalau</malay> (um)
he should know better [what] right that's what I'm saying you should have Muzmatch [sia] this is not like <malay>macam remeh-temeh</malay> girl [tau] it's not like <malay>macam</malay>
modern kind of girl where they are open-minded [tau] you have so many religious girls that are like you know very strict about shit
so the primary school girl still has the criteria right
so how is it different than (uh) if you know that she's religious how is it different
right so so ya exactly so this is the dumbest shit that people do they date first then they become friends no
for me is I'm going to use my skills to flirt and be your friend
for me to and not because like [eh] <malay>aku</malay> no no no I mean my gift #alhamdulillah# is I can make anybody be fucking comfortable with me so I use that to my advantage
for you to spit out every fucking shit even you're vulnerable side because when you tell me about your vulnerability then I start to understand that
(um) (uh) how do you cope with that vulnerability so if you say like I'm actually
I'm nowhere where I'm at now but I fucking promise one day I'll get up there that is the kind of fucking response I want to get from a man <malay>faham tak</malay>
you're at his fucking like stage in life where your fucking life is so hard like <malay>macam</malay> you're going through a lot of (uh) problems but you have so much to do with it
you are not small boy it's not like [eh] family <malay>aku</malay> my family is (uh) (uh) poor I mean (uh) <malay>mak bapa aku sakit abeh aku masih kat sekolah</malay>
<malay>itu aku boleh bagi</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> #buto# <malay>kalau kau tengah kerja kau masih nak</malay> complain
you know that's why in my in my head is like <malay>macam</malay>
find the red flags I I I think I'm I'm saying this because a lot of negative shit happened in my life that I just know
what are red flags and what is not
and like <malay>macam</malay> I just see through the fucking bullshit I'm not going to lie sometimes when I date date someone also
(uh) I'm blinded that was the one <malay>yang dengan</malay> the arab guy that I was with <malay>yang macam aku betul-betul sayang</malay> but <malay>dia macam</malay>
cause of the hierarchy and the how the family view me
you don't hear me saying like [oh] fuck I'm a malay I cannot [eh] shut the fuck up I can date ten fucking arabs guy arab guy once I'm up there when I'm the same level as them because that is what I want to pursue you want to get
this kind of fella you fucking fight for it you don't
like <malay>dalam</malay> islam <malay>pun cakap</malay> a good girl is for a good guy if you don't get it maybe you should self-check so <malay>cakap dengan dia gitu</malay> maybe that's why I don't get the girl is so simple as that
if if you want to say that <malay>kalau kau nak macam</malay> if you play by insecurity saying that !aiya! <malay>aku tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>aku ni buruk aku tahu</malay> [lah]
and then <malay>diam</malay> [lah] [sial] <malay>macam</malay> do something about it because you're not handicapped there's so many other people that <malay>kena</malay> burn on the face
and can do nothing about it but did they fucking complain no like <malay>macam</malay> ya so
at and and and even if you are fucking ugly but the the determination is fucking attractive
so like like I said all these acts of
is very scary to me scary
sending sending portrait then like you big fuck
you already fucking put your dignity on the fucking floor you step on it already you send a girl a portrait what the fuck sorry <malay>aku macam</malay> really that's that's weird
<malay>macam</malay>
it's weird [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
it's weird too it's weird to me it's weird [lah] unless you good boy but you good boy also it's fucking lame [what] like
how to say [ah] it's weird it's weird unless <malay>kau macam</malay>
if if you put yourself out in the media
then I understand
like ya so if let's say you are youtuber or whatnot then people send stuff
fan mail then legit <malay>kena</malay> call fan [sia] fan I also want to vomit [sia] !huh! <malay>kau</malay> fanatic <malay>dia ni</malay> when she's just a pretty girl there's no such thing other than that
I mean obviously you are gorgeous but you have to understand that
lame dudes I don't want to call him lame but I'm always right so let me just say that
no you should tell him straight [ah] [eh] <malay>kimak kau</malay> lame [pe] <malay>kau hantar perempuan gini</malay> that means before <malay>aku kau hantar perempuan apa</malay> [eh] <malay>macam tiba-tiba</malay>
what the fuck do you do with your free time <malay>kau</malay> scroll <malay>perempuan lawa pastu kau hantar</malay> portrait
did you know what I'm saying
[ah] so before he send you the portrait you all talk before
in real life or
message shut the fuck up then shut the fuck up then there's so many people I talk through message also and I don't give a shit that was the those are the least kind of people that I give a fuck about because I
I never go out with them you have to understand if you text a serial killer
don't know what they are serial killer until you go out with them correct
why are you putting yourself in a fucking position
shut the fuck up you already like him
if you don't like him right trust me if you don't like him I I know that <malay>kau perangai kakak-kakak kau punya orang boleh</malay> steady <malay>punya tapi kau dah kau dah suka</malay>
this is what I want my friend to do to me also if I'm fucking blinded as fuck
legit legit portrait is already how many times I have to say I think ten thousand times in this recording [ah]
they need to type [ah] their to
[ah] transcript !huh! portrait copy paste copy paste
<malay>faham tak</malay>
you like the company
but you won't love you won't correct because let's be real
for me before this also I impress all of the guys that I want to go out with
once you date me you die already you die already all my my <malay>macam</malay> bipolar attitude
all my shout I tell you already [what] I'm abusive [what] back then [lah] you know like I don't give a like bro <malay>aku boleh ambil kaca aku boleh campak</malay> [sia] <malay>muka kau pun aku boleh pecah</malay> [kan] [sia] and as a guy also
you cannot leave the mentality is that I'm a guy so I cannot whack back
#chao# if you're not leaving me also you don't have any self-worth the fact that I'm so into personal growth
is because that is the truth in life
who the fuck <malay>macam</malay> owes you a fucking living that you have to change them your mother father [lah] but not your partner <malay>faham tak</malay> so
that's why to me is like if you are at this stage to like <malay>kau dah</malay> mature enough don't lower your standard for a man who doesn't
and I'm not saying you shouldn't be with him I have friends who literally the the guy <malay>masuk</malay> jail <malay>cakap</malay> once you are a millionaire then you marry me and he fucking learn [eh]
in jail [eh] say once I get past my O levels I will marry (uh) and I'll once I become a millionaire I will pursue you and I will chase after you and I'll marry you men will go to that extend even me
let's be real if the person is worth it so he give you a portrait when he doesn't even fucking know you that's weird
that is weird let's see <malay>kalau kau betul-betul</malay> cut contact let's see who else he send the portrait to bet [ah]
that is what I used to [what] that's a fucking pattern [what] you know nobody changes overnight
you send a portrait you got the girl so easy that's why I tell you to play the game
like him you can like him look at his red flags once he blow you off then you know how to cut
<malay>faham tak</malay> cause
don't waste your time you are a I mean I don't want to say you lower your standards [ah] but you deserve so much more
to be in this position with a guy that send you a portrait
[oh] whatever I'm hearing I'm sorry I'm I'm okay one thing is I'm very protective of my friends number two
I can just see shit
clearly
just now cannot [lah] because not twenty twenty vision [mah] put braces [mah] my eyes
ya so that's why <malay>aku cakap kau</malay> it it all takes time [what] people especially when you like someone bro
they lie people lie
and you've never been he been been (uh) at his lowest point of (uh) point in his life have you ever be that <malay>kau tengok kau boleh tahan ke tak</malay>
then you will know if you're fucking mature or not
[oh] maybe that's why you have a job that won't allow you to fucking (um) pursue a better goal
you fucking tell me <malay>engkau</malay> then <malay>apa diam</malay> [ah] [sial] then you want you have a better goal [lah] like it's simple as that <malay>macam</malay>
if my brother that's a dropout can fucking earn (uh) like maybe because
how to say [ah] when you've already tasted a higher standard of living you just want to work for it
one day I can assume about him benefit of the doubt is maybe he he has never tasted a better life of living maybe he don't have that knowledge he's not blessed with that knowledge so
that's why you as a you you you say you are a friend right bless him with that knowledge see what he will do with it
but at the same time like
don't settle down for what you're not satisfied with serious for me a guy I need to be like fucking like a monkey
for me to legit be like pursuing you if you make me no sorry
if if it's more of like I want to get to I really want to get to know this guy he has everything like
how to say [ah] for me
I'm not there yet so I don't even
I didn't even want to date because I don't want to settle for less so for me it's like looks
(uh) dressing and morals
then after that once I really really really really like you because everything is fine then I will just pursue chemistry
chemistry is there
if if he really likes me then
(uh) that that that that's where I play my game <malay>faham tak</malay> of like
okay I think I should give him a bit more attention I really really like him but at the same time
I don't pursue guys who are fifty fifty about me because
you can like people keep saying like [oh] you like
I think people like to see me as like confident like she can get that guy nope is I just don't waste time with people that I know I cannot get
like must have to realistic like not like there's so many people much more good looking than me and there's so much
(um) like I have a lot to work on but
I pick my battle [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay this guy is enough for me
then if it's not enough then I make myself enough
you know that kind of thing so people that that rush into relationship are sus
sus send portrait sus
tell you before [leh] fuck bro <malay>kimak aku punya</malay> boyfriend <malay>dulu</malay> [eh] <malay>perempuan hantar dia macam</malay>
[eh] I saw you around school you look cute <malay>aku maki</malay> [sia] #buto# <malay>siapa perempuan ni dia nak tengok-tengok</malay> you <malay>buat apa dia pasal</malay> what
cause he's fucking fat !wah! fuck you #chibai# want to fucking look look look shut the fuck up [ah] want to look at my boyfriend for what
#buto# I cannot because but then that was when I was insecure but now when I realise that
my boyfriend has to reassure me I feel lame
because to me is I fucking sound psychotic but but that is what
people do
so if you as a man behave like a desperate fucker I cannot I cannot
if you chase after a girl as if you have no self send portrait if my boyfriend fucking do that I'll smack the shit out of him obviously you can send portraits to me if
this is weird babe nobody fucking do that nobody fucking do that I'm scared if
insecurities will come up
not you you obviously don't but if if
no what if your insecurities come out he play with it
<malay>faham tak</malay>
<malay>asal kau</malay> you can be vulnerable but at the same time you have you have to be like I know I know sleepy
you you can be vulnerable but at the same time just say like
[oh] anytime if I want to cut you off which is good [lah] I think you have low low tolerance also for bullshit I'm hoping [ah]
(mm) (mm)
correct so
<malay>bapa aku</malay> [sia] <malay>nama bapa aku</malay> [sial]
in a man
and then
fuck it fuck [ah]
which is
correct correct
he did all the work what work need to work [meh]
ya isn't that good
!huh!
but then
[ah] that's fine
correct
correct you have to understand there's
I have so many hot ass
fucking girlfriends
that get with a fucking ugly guy because he's charismatic
insecure
correct insecure
I'm also charismatic how many people that I use
so many worse is you date a guy that is ugly and cheated on you might as well date a good looking guy
right so that's why to me is like
but I'm not okay I'm just throwing the worst of the worst so that you know how to react quick with fear
then you're much more clearer instead of nevermind just let it be it's okay so that's why I'm telling you <malay>kalau</malay>
obviously that that that I think that's how life should be that you date someone that is
the looks
people say that looks don't matter suck my dick [lah] !huh! looks and also (um)
not status looks and (um) body language
when that is okay then after that your your
(uh) no no looks and confidence so
confidence might also play with the look so if you're actually fucking ugly but you have a lot of confidence because you have a lot of skills that people look up to
you're already fucking good looking already that is looks to me not just physical then after that is the the charismatic so
if he if he's not confident he don't pass the confidence <malay>punya</malay>
(mm) test
you gonna die
ya it's pandemic all over again
if this you choose this fella is the one that you're gonna marry and this (uh) and if you have to you have to teach a man how to work on his own
fuck that shit
and a man who's very very independent on on the on the on the partner (uh) (uh) toxic
you depend on the partner to change toxic
you can obviously
advise but it's what he do
so many people can rise up but it's how much they want it
wait but then saturday sunday <malay>kau buat apa kau keluar dengan dia</malay>
okay ya then then just hang with them like <malay>macam</malay> you want to have fun that is that is that is proper fun bro
don't don't need to date men

motherfucker you just fucking told me you ask him out that's a fucking date for fucking sure bro he's not your friend
stop it like <malay>macam</malay> if you tell your if tell your [oh] my god I don't accept that shit like my my partner got tell me before <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] I went out with this girl I <malay>tak pernah</malay> I <malay>tak pernah</malay>
<malay>dia gila-gila</malay> [kan] I <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak pernah</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay>
but you reciprocate
my boyfriend said that he doesn't he just use like he just know that [oh] this girl got got <malay>macam</malay>
(uh)
this guy has other hot girlfriends at that point of time he was single okay so he was single until I was the first girl that he dated so he's good looking so a
he was dating a lot of girls
but he don't like anyone of them so if you're single you're free to be a fucking cunt [what] right so when
he see that girl as an opportunity to get to know other hot chicks so
when she him and saying that [oh] you're so cute
he's like a before me he was a fucking flirt cause he's single but he try to play off like I'm just a friend [what] but I know you're fucking flirt you know
before that I was I never use people before because of him I used people because of what happened then after that (um)
when you get close to the girl the girl obviously like like him but then he with
all due respect like he try to not I don't even know if he does that [lah] but he said as like <malay>macam</malay> okay I'm just your friend I'm just your friend but then I #simplicate# whatever text you send me so he told me that he never liked her at all
and he was friendzoning her because she got other hot chicks hot friends
and then that is to me is like then okay [lor] then I'm not that mad at the fact that you still keep in contact but at the end of the day
once he was a bit more serious with me he cut contact with that girl because he knows that I'm not happy but I told him I'm fucking liberal

it's unpopular opinion I know ya because I don't like to smile
so when I don't when I wear the mask people don't expect me to smile I mean you can you can eye smile
what
ya [lah] that's why it it makes me tired
ya
ya I mean actually I'm not unhappy or you know I just have the (uh) the what they call the resting bitch face [ah]
so when I work at events because usually they pay quite high so I don't mind smiling you know like [oh] hi welcome to <malay>apa apa apa</malay> you know then
do [ah] then after that then I will just like
my my resting face will go back during break time or something [ah]
you know
so ya but then
now like go out everything like because everyone wear mask [what] then also I think people cannot recognise me so I'm quite happy like I mean not like I famous <malay>ke apa</malay> [lah]
but then it's like you know sometimes you you see people
you don't want to <malay>tegur</malay> like that then you just like !alamak! <malay>dia ni lagi</malay> then
hope they don't recognise me and think I'm just another malay girl
so I just like walk past them

<malay>apa</malay>
[ah] ya still searching [lah] that's why I I end up
about knowing this [lah]
ya
[a'ah] ya [lah] that's why I'm trying to go for that but then
most of the stuff that I apply for right it's either I don't have the qualifications so I'm not accepted
or they say that I'm overqualified that's why they don't want to accept me so it's like
[ah]
<malay>apa</malay>
ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah]
that's why
my friend <malay>dia nak jadi</malay> temperature screener [kan] <malay>dekat kedai tu</malay> [kan]
then <malay>dia orang kata mesti ada</malay> diploma then I'm like
<malay>susah sangat ke</malay> temperature screener you know like <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
<malay>tak</malay> makes sense [ah] I think <malay>dia orang macam sengaja nak</malay>
<malay>buat susah</malay> you know then they complain like you know [oh] nobody want to apply <malay>padahal</malay>
I don't know [ah] what's going on also

I do events so I can quote unquote handle classroom <malay>gitu</malay>
then I mean
technically I think
normal people should have enough educational background to teach
I don't know about you [lah] but ya
(mm) (mm) then
(mm)
(mm) ya usually they they like (um) and they like they prefer
registered people [ah] usually
but like
ya I
what
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's why I usually go like enrichment centre that one they a bit more lax [ah]
as long as you can like do the job scope they will be okay with hiring you
but then the teaching also that time
they closed all the education centres so it's like
you know
my flow got disrupted and then
ya then <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] (uh)
ya then now also like <malay>nak</malay> classroom but then because you have to adhere to the COVID regulations then like <malay>macam</malay>
every hour <malay>kena</malay> sanitise <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] like (ugh)
ya ya ya you like you
already have a lot to do which is like plan the lesson and then like teach the lesson then suddenly now got added job scope [ah]
then <malay>macam malas gitu</malay> [ah]
ya but this one <malay>dia</malay> toxic [ah] the the
the other teacher no actually actually the the other teachers are quite okay [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> the management [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ngada-ngada</malay> [ah] I don't know how to say
[ah]
that's why
ya
because I was there for training
then like the first three days the management <malay>tak datang</malay> so I'm like okay [ah] this job like not bad [ah] I quite enjoying myself like still not very
like <malay>macam</malay>
(um)
not very good friends with the rest of the teacher but <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] can manage [lah] you know not so
not so terrible like I don't hate anybody then nobody hate me you know also then after that the third day onwards the management come to like
(um) <malay>tengok</malay> how I work [lah] you know
then then they say a lot bad things about me then <malay>dia orang</malay>
like they just like mood totally go down [seh] I don't know [ah] then
ya she damn <malay>cari pasal</malay> [ah] like with me like <malay>semua benda yang</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> which I think is like
not even her problem <malay>dia macam tak</malay> okay
then I like <malay>malas</malay> already then ya then like
because it's ya then she say right because the one week is training [tau]
then she say to me like (um) what [ah]
you come here you don't know anything (uh) then how you going to teach the kids
then I'm like isn't this what's the point of training like I
if I know everything why I training right like <malay>bodoh</malay> [pe] <malay>perempuan ni</malay>
ya
<malay>apa</malay>
ya ya
ya
she said twice [eh] in chinese she said
no first she complained she complained to the boss
like because because we have a staff meeting [what]
so (uh) she complain to the boss in chinese
(uh) then then I know what he what they she roughly mean [ah] I don't get like everything but I <malay>boleh faham sikit-sikit</malay> [ah]
so ya the I was I know already she talking about me and she say about how like
<malay>aku baru</malay> then <malay>aku tak tahu apa-apa</malay> you know things like that then I'm like
fine whatever just
keep quiet [ah] then after that then she like
at the end of that day she
or is it the next day or something like that then she like <malay>tegur</malay> me [ah] she was like
then she was like okay I'm going to test you then I'm like [eh] <malay>kau orang belum ajar aku apa-apa</malay> then <malay>kau orang nak</malay> test <malay>aku</malay>
but then I'm like okay fine nevermind just do the test so obviously I passed [lah] because I do have the
credentials like
I know what I'm doing [lah] basically it's just
I don't know how they do it you know so cause you know some
like let's say if math
some schools they prefer like one plus one equals two
then they like
they use finger you know
but then some other schools they prefer to use mental sums
so I don't know what's their method they never tell me so I (uh) obviously but
if I if you ask me to do one plus one I know how to do [lah] because
I know how to do [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> so I managed to pass the test [lah] then she was like okay actually (um) I think you can
do okay you can quite teach [lah] but then
(uh) you don't know anything so I (uh) that time I'm just like <malay>malas</malay> [seh] <malay>nak datang balik</malay>
ya so that one gone [ah]
ya
ya [lah] ya [lah]
<malay>biar dia cari orang lain</malay>
you want <malay>kira</malay> work from home [ah] I don't want [seh]
(err)
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
but in in terms of what do you mean
like
(mm)
[ah]
[oh] you mean [ah] are you like developers or
not really
[oh]
[oh] ya ya ya
!wah! that's interesting [ah] I was contemplating learning that
ya because (um)
upper course ya
that's cool [ah]
because I got media arts
(um) diploma advanced diploma ya
so I understand what you mean by
sometimes you just want to work from home because
it I don't know it's
pointless to go to the office I don't know
ya
obviously ya
(mm)
[a'ah]
ya ya
ya
that's why that's why
ya
it's okay
I think everywhere is always renovating [ah] so it's okay
ya like I
okay they pause be a bit because of COVID then I think because of the dorm situation also
ya
but then now I I see like <malay>macam dia orang dah potong semua pokok semua</malay> I don't know what the hell they are doing but okay [lah] I guess
ya
(mm) suffocating
like means what
[oh]
I don't know [eh]
my friends <malay>semua macam</malay> introvert <malay>dengan</malay> homebody <malay>juga</malay> so it was quite fun [lah] for us circuit breaker we just
all on our computer then we all just like zoom call each other <malay>macam</malay>
sometimes the whole day you know then we just like catch up then we like what the fuck ya because sometimes because if you like
you ask them to <malay>jumpa</malay> right like like
like what like you know we always postpone postpone [oh] I I free then I'm not free then I'm not free
and then like suddenly like sometimes on the day itself like [eh] actually I don't feel like going out [ah] then like ya me too you know then never happens
so this one everyone at home online so
#shiok# [ah] like we living our best life [ah] but then I suffocated in a sense that
(um)
I don't like my family
I think I stayed
too wild too long in that's why I'm like <malay>macam</malay>
sometimes the things they do is just
[ah] ya it's like
why are you guys doing this
you know like
ya
ya everyday ya
ya
but it's so crazy [lah] because last time where it's like you know you work until like
sometimes you don't even meet the person for the whole entire day or you know
but then this one is like everyday wake up everyone at home kind of ya but ya
so it's just ya
[oh] (um) still the same also [lah] two but (um) I'm the eldest so that's why
I don't know it's very weird [leh] because (um)
like I'm the eldest [kan]
then I got one younger sister and one younger brother
but then my parents <malay>dia orang macam nak</malay> my sis my younger sister to marry first
ya
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] I think my relationship longer but my relationship (uh) I'm also attached to a non-muslim
so
ya it makes things more complicated [ah] I guess then my sister she <malay>macam</malay>
she attached <malay>dengan</malay> muslim guy so that's already one
barrier crossed and then
(um) she got a
early childhood cert which is my according to them more stable which I also agree [lah]
so ya she got a more stable like job and like
qualifications so they want her to marry
marry her off [lah] ya
(mm)
ya
but then now she also not working in early childhood [ah]
ya but she got the cert [lah] ya
no [lah] she working in those like F&B jobs [lah]
ya
ya
that's why but then also
is I don't know [eh]
<malay>macam sekarang</malay> right I was thinking like is it
better in the long run if you marry now or better in the long run if you marry later
but then to me it's like
marriage is just like <malay>macam</malay>
law legally binding law law [what] you know
ya I get what you mean
ya
[eh] but then you know what so scary [leh] like <malay>macam</malay>
(um) recently [kan] I <malay>baca kat</malay>
facebook [ah] now now got a lot of free time [what] so more time to browse facebook <malay>gitu semua</malay>
[ah] then like a lot of cases of married people cheating
then I'm just like
!wah! then [ah] so if cause to me right <malay>macam kalau kita</malay> relationship then they cheat right at least we can break off
pretty easily you know but then if divorce
right then
need lawyer need to sign things all <malay>macam</malay> (ugh) <malay>malas</malay> [ah]
(mm)
is it
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
I thought we only need to go to the course like some
(um) relationship course or marriage preparation course
and then we get the cert and then we can (um)
get (uh) engaged and married [what]
[oh] okay that one also I don't know but normally [lah] normally is just you
both go for the
marriage preparation course you get the cert then you can get engaged then can get married the next day or something like that ya
ya (mm)
I mean that's
(uh) that's from my experience [lah] I don't know whether
not like I got married before [lah] but you know like
because I got an older cousin and that's how he got married
so I was also like
ya [oh] this is how it's supposed to be [ah] I don't know
me and ya you met him before or not no right
or have I talked to you about him before no right like long time right ya
(err) (uh) (um) almost three years already
to be honest I want to get married already you know because I feel like I'm also getting old
then I think like
right now is actually the best time for me to like have a baby
because (uh) first of all I see many people doing it and I'm so jealous [what]
<malay>apa</malay>
sorry what
(uh) <malay>tak</malay> I think they give up on me already
that's why like recently I you know <malay>rajin-rajin</malay> in the kitchen then <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
[oh] (um) #izzati# finally can get married <malay>gitu</malay> you know but then I'm just like
whatever [lah] you know ya ya so
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much <malay>kalau tahu</malay> I just
have a baby now you know I think it'll be quite fun [lah] because I don't have to work and then
I mean I'm not sure if it's will be gonna be fun [lah] but you know at least like now I know that I'm not busy working because I don't think I want to be a working mum when I'm like heavily pregnant <malay>gitu</malay> you know
so ya it's just a waste of opportunity [lah] I feel
why
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] my god
[ah]
but (uh) I think it's okay [ah] cause you twenty five almost still young
ya
ya ya ya ya
<malay>apa ni</malay>
like
I I'm quite glad that when I was twenty five I
like #chiongster# also [lah] <malay>kerja banyak</malay> and things like that then my parents also not happy [ah] because like
supposedly twenty five <malay>kita kena dah</malay> married already you know but then I was still like working my ass off [lah]
[oh] okay let me see what ass but nevermind ya so I was still working like crazy [lah] then but I'm glad because I worked
like crazy last time
so now in COVID I'm quite relaxed
a lot of people are like you know [oh] I'm living paycheck to paycheck but then because I have savings because last time I work like crazy so I'm quite
okay [lah] like I can go with like one week not working things like that or one month sometimes depends ya
(um) I think it's good that you are actually working not now so
I think it's good that you are actually working a lot now
but also a bit crazy [lah] you
so then how !huh!
[oh]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya
interesting that you mentioned that because I have the same exact thing
it's like okay but actually I I said I hate my family [kan] but then actually I'm quite okay with them
but the thing is I can't wait to move out also
so
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay> [lah] then what !huh!
girl [ah] ya ya ya my mum ya [lor] that one also is like
I ya I just
I want to get out of your house to go into another house
ya because I mean
<malay>kita pun ada cakap</malay> [ah] like discuss are you okay with living with my in-laws for a while
you know like before we get a house if we could get to married
if we were to get married first you know
then I don't know man
(mm)
my boyfriend have bigger house so we probably gonna move there but I'm not sure how the family would feel about that [lah]
but so far I've been going over they quite okay [leh] it's more like okay it's actually (um) my family is more colder to him I think because he's a non-muslim
so I can't really imagine him living in this house
you know
ya
but then
see how [lah] but I'm I'm still hoping like what you said [lah] we both like have our own place already
and then like okay [lah] maybe like I don't mind like after married like stay one month in the in-laws house
you know like in
interim period [lah]
but then I don't want to live there for very long and especially if I'm pregnant right I don't want to live in there
in any in-laws house
I just want to live in like our own
little thing
but then they say if you want right you should already
ya because my friend like
they like for six years
then in between they got married so they she has to live in the
husband's
house [lah]
and the in-laws house
then she say it's like hell [lah] because the mother in-law <malay>macam</malay>
like have a lot of expectations of her <malay>gitu</malay>
ya
(mm)
but sometimes <malay>kecoh</malay> is fun you know
or you mean the other kind of <malay>kecoh</malay>
ya ya
because like
I feel
[oh] okay ya I understand
ya
that's interesting
no I was gonna say (um) last year
last yearish my grandma and then it seems like the house is very empty
so I think if I can bring another person in like it will be quite nice but then apparently my parents are not cool with him
so ya I'm I'm I'm dreading the thought that my sister will get married and then they will move in here
I know that's why but I've talked to her before then she <malay>cakap dia tak nak</malay> [ah] she <malay>nak cari rumah sendiri juga</malay>
so but then she say [lah] like in now these days a bit difficult [lah] but then
her ideal goal is still to move out [lah] ya
but then (ugh)
like
why you don't like the the the partner [ah]
(mm)
ya the okay
[eh]
ask her to get out [ah] really ya ya ya okay [dah]
(ugh)
ya ya ya
[oh] my gosh that's interesting [eh]
would you get rid of your cats so that she can live in your house
ya ya
(mm) okay that's not so bad ya
ya that's why and they are always in #jurong# no offence
I don't know what's with it with you guys ya
like you know <malay>hari raya</malay> you <malay>pergi</malay> like <malay>rumah kat</malay> #jurong# then <malay>mesti ada kucing punya</malay> I don't know [ah] I don't know how to say ya
ya
I never say [ah] <malay>bukan aku cakap</malay> [eh]
I don't even know that you shouldn't have told me
I always thought #jurong# was cool like the west side you know like [oh] cool the west side but then
I know north is crazy because of #yishun#
so that's all I know but then now you say like that then I a bit like okay #jurong# a bit dodgy
[a'ah]
but it's okay I will still think of nicely of #jurong#
you guys are just another country no just kidding
it's like you know like
[oh] <malay>pergi</malay> #pasir ris# then I [oh] <malay>pergi</malay> #changi# okay then <malay>pergi</malay> #jurong# [ah] I
!wah! that sound so far away I don't know why
ya
(mmhmm)
yes it's true
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya that's right
(mm)
(hmm) do you like that or not
okay
(mm)
[oh]
those are touch and run away kind ya
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[a'ah]
<malay>seram</malay> [seh]
the what you do
<malay>apa</malay>
what the
[ah] ya so what did you do when those things happened to you
<malay>apa</malay>
watch group !wah! your parents also very ons [eh]
[ah]
[oh]
(mm)
(mm) interesting
right now we don't go out so we don't get followed home
[oh] but recently my sister <malay>kena</malay> then I was like what the hell
ya but I don't think I can be like you [lah]
like the last three times (uh) people someone follow me home I just confront them I don't care
you are not wrong I'm also very small but I think I'm just
(uh)
more like like I think too well of myself
a bit overconfident [lah] <malay>dia orang kata</malay>
ya
so so it's like I'm like !oi! (uh) why you follow me like you know <malay>padahal</malay> I'm just a
small you know like sometimes they tower over you also
but then I don't care like you come you want to fight with me [ah] want like ya
ya it's damn irritating I cannot stand it [ah] like what you say [ah]
sometimes <malay>dia orang</malay> will follow from a distance which I can still like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>buat bodoh</malay> [lah] you know then
but then if they got are like obviously in the same lift
there was one guy who even like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>naik</malay> [kan] then you know usually you go whenever whichever door is nearest to you and that is
empty [kan]
did he he immediately ran just to go inside the same door with me you know
and then
[ah] ya then after that then I like walk over to the next door [ah]
and actually because I want to lean [ah] because I <malay>malas</malay>
ya then I then I walk then he was immediately like run after me to make sure that he don't lose sight of me
then I'm like what the fuck ya !oops! I cursed
ya [lah] ya [lah] so I'm just like [oh] I don't know if I can
stand it like you but then
recently [kan] I feel like <malay>macam</malay> I want to move to the west side because
most of the not most of the jobs that I want [lah] but then
like
I kind of want to see how it's like to be a factory worker and most of the factories are very far away from me
actually no [ah] #ang mo kio# also got industrial park [lah] but that one is different industry
but ya
ya so it's like <malay>macam</malay> I feel like if I live nearer to the west it will be easier for me to get a job there
I mean not easier [lah] it will be
life you know like sometimes the the <malay>kerja</malay> is like so far away from your <malay>rumah</malay> then it's like (ugh) <malay>malas</malay> ya
so ya [lah] ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I think if I'm nearer to the west I probably won't (uh) what
(mm) ya
that's why
but town is not so bad
(um) ya
would you rather town or #tanjong pagar#
it's a bit far for me
(uh huh)
ya
I cannot [lah] I I just for me I feel I get
(mm)
ya
ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya
ya but I think like what you say right I think it's a bit too quiet for me also
(ugh)
ya [lah] cause in #ang mo kio# like <malay>macam</malay> nobody ever sleeps
so it's damn irritating
then sometimes like three [kan] <malay>ada orang cakap-cakap kat telefon</malay> then <malay>dia orang ketawa</malay> like laugh their heart out then I feel like so irritated you know
then I'm just like maybe I should just go somewhere else where it's a lot more quieter
but then
[ah] I don't know man
I guess everywhere got pros and cons [lah] pros and cons
(mm)
ya
I don't know [ah] I think I just
I don't know man
right now it's like everywhere is quite expensive also
ya
actually my plan [kan] like
I wanted to rent a place already you know
before this
before COVID [lah] so I plan like
this year I want to try moving out of my parent's house so I just want to rent somewhere
and then just live happily with my boyfriend
ya but ya something like that [lah] like live somewhere nearer to the work
place that I was working at and then just
you know like have my own place there
but then obviously like
because of my COVID like most of my savings of that for that plan like already gone so
so sad ya
(mmhmm)
but town is so expensive
nearer
correct
(mm)
obviously ya
interesting
ya [lah] ya [lah] such is life
<malay>apa</malay>
my plan
[a'ah]
but I think he don't want [lah]
because he also still studying then he want to like (uh) like what you say [lah] <malay>macam nak habiskan sekolah dulu</malay>
but then
the the thing is that he wants to go for a double degree or something like that which will take more time
so I'm not sure if I'm willing to wait that long [eh] like
I would hope that he would be okay with marrying me in between you know
<malay>sebab dia nak jadi</malay> teacher so now he studying the subject
a degree in the subject that he's interested in
then after that then he still need like what you said [lah] he still need a teaching degree
because he wants to work at <malay>punya</malay> kind of school
then I'm just like !wah! that's very long [eh] that's like almost like eight years that I have to wait and I don't know if I want to wait that long
you know
eight years is a really long time ya
ya and then that when during within that eight years right he still haven't <malay>kerja</malay> you know so I have I probably still have to wait another few years for him to be able to afford a house
so I'm not sure if I want to
do that [lah]
[a'ah]
I know right so that's why it doesn't look very bleak I mean it doesn't doesn't look very bright for me ya
so I don't know about that [lah]
but
hopefully he will change his ways I don't know because he got
say before that he is <malay>macam</malay>
like when he got school [kan] <malay>dia nak</malay>
study [jer] but then like during semester break or whatever he want to find job [ah] so it's not like he just
school and never earn income you know
(uh) but then that semester break it I think is is <malay>macam</malay> charity
that's why just like normal expenditure [kan] it's not like saving for a house <malay>gitu</malay> you know
so
ya
it sounds quite bad for me [lah] sometimes I wish I just have a nice (uh) rich boyfriend
so that you know all these things can like
be over with it
ya
ya so
what
my boyfriend what
race
(uh) you [lah]
[ah] <malay>cina</malay> [lah]
(uh) #qian jin# is a
actually I don't
I don't know [ah] like when back then like cause I was your age not so long ago (um)
I was workaholic also [lah] then <malay>macam</malay>
not really keen on getting married or getting attached even
you know so I'm just like

<malay>ada</malay> children all then in the end
I met him then I was like actually we can click [ah] then like so we fall

to the to the to the to the <malay>tempat</malay> [lah] to the destination we don't
we don't
we don't
push each other than the one person who was pushing the other person just left behind or whatever shit I don't know if you understand what I'm trying to say but ya
K it's like for example
<malay>sekarang ini</malay>
<malay>saya cakap saya akan tolak awak sampai awak</malay> to your destination which is become doctor
when I <malay>tolak</malay> you right
I cannot be there at the same level I cannot be at the same pace as you
I have I'll be lagging behind cause I'm pushing you
I cannot be
I cannot be standing beside you and push you
I have to stand be stand I have to <malay>diri belakang awak untuk tolak</malay>
so if I <malay>tolak</malay> you
you reach the finishing you reach the finish line first I'll be at behind then who will be helping me you cannot pull my hand cause you at the finishing line already

of of what
<malay>kena apa</malay>
[oh] then they will go into phase three

ya they say is like
it's like won't be as what you experience
before like it won't be back to pre-COVID life [lah] definitely
but I just hope like there comes a point in time whereby don't need wear mask
damn hard to breathe [sia] sometimes
especially on hot days
(hmm)
<malay>rimas</malay> ya
but then
what to do is like that [lor]
[oh] you want to go

[oh] ya ya
so you deployed to
to little india [ah] [orh]
[eh] you get you are that division
I always thought you at the woodlands one
[ah]
[oh] okay I mean that's more convenient [lah] in my opinion ya easier [mah]
!wah! then that yesterday I also talked with adrian
about like you know adrian is in
[oh] (err) TransCom adrian [lah]
he also went for shooting the other day
ya then he says he's damn busy now
(hmm) <malay>belum</malay> my [one] supposed to be
ya supposed to be this week

<malay>sekarang ada apa tu</malay> (uh) lectures
so they say okay never mind can come another time then like [oh] okay [ah] then they I think they reschedule me for
january [ah] january eight ya
next try will be next try will be when [ah] early of [eh]
eleventh of jan I think
[ah] [oh] damn
okay [lah] hopefully [lah] cause
I just want to get it over and done with [ah] they say is just like <malay>satu hari</malay> [kan] so should be okay if not like I have to go this [one]
the the one that they actually ask me to go now right is like
<malay>berapa hari</malay> [ah]
<malay>dua hari</malay> [ah] so one day then <malay>lagi satu hari</malay> the actual shoot [ah]
ya but I don't know why they ask me okay (err) thursday you come for then friday come for the shoot then like
why not just one shot
because I remember right like
is very fast also
it's not like takes a long time
[oh]
maybe [ah]
[orh]
I mean that would make sense [lah] is earlier
[ah]
been awhile since I go there also [sia]
[eh] no [lah] last time I went was for
!wah! that [one] #shaggy#
ya
ya
no now is cause of COVID right so now they make the
they make it (err) you so (um) one week
push-up all that right the person is
(err) standing away
from you
like maybe
ya then they count [lor]
but then (err) cause of this right there's no contact thing right then
(err)
there's no gauge for you when to
(uh) push-up until
so they say just make sure your
elbow ninety
and something else I forget already
ya then so is easier [lah] but then
ya [sia] true
you got try at #maju# [ah]
[ah] #maju# the
#maju# is very the the machine
damn cock like <malay>susah untuk</malay>
use [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
the the what [ah] the
the track is actually shorter
like I don't know why but that day that day I like
screw up the the run [eh] the
the
(uh) statics because is all automatic
then I <malay>tak pernah buat</malay> [kan] so
<malay>macam</malay> new experience [ah] then
(err) when I use then I !wah!
why so hard then it always never detect
then like I needed like a ten ten to
ten ten to get silver minimum
then like !wah! I never run this fast before [sia]
even like our our trainee time right I think I run like ten ten thirty
ten thirty was my best
and that was like the most fit we ever been [sia]
then suddenly I run run run right like I didn't really care like tired or what then I run then suddenly ten O three then I like !wow!
ya I think adrian the one that told me the track is like very short
so like you won't you won't feel
it doesn't look like it [lah] but actually is
shorter I
think cause one thing is indoor
ya
so ya if you wanna like
if your statistics like not bad and then it's just your running right
then
you can consider #maju# [lah]
cause anyway very near like
you take one bus
[ah]
[ah] ya ya same same like #maju# [lah]
I mean
okay [lor]
sick wait with incentives is hundred right
I think with incentive is like <malay>seratus</malay> [eh]

no action also #sian#
like at least you all get to experience stuff like you got to experience stuff

there was one [lah] but it's damn lame it's not like it's not like your kind of standard like go go deployed for anything is like
is this is the police day parade is it
(uh) I think then it was at
marina stadium there [ah] then what they did was what I had to do was (err)
I just accompany them on the boat

I was deployed as a medic but then there was
nothing to do
okay [lah]
fudge

what's what's the then what's this like demons layer thing about [sia]
is it like is it like like attack on titan
ya ya ya
right
is like at the start right all the it really caught me cause
is like
super dynamic the way they
put the like animation style then I was like !wow! this is quite
but then now the story like I don't know what's going on already
but then they say the final season coming out soon
ya ya
why
how is this
but I haven't like
but like read any #manga# before [sia]
got recommends

no as in as in what what what what what was it
now this
year still got what movie that's
marvel when you went there ya
I watch the new mutants not not that good [sia]
but that's
black panther [eh]
[ah] ya black widow I think
end of the year [ah]
[eh] you <malay>tak ikut</malay> the trilogy [eh]
the
the whole marvel scene
<malay>dari</malay> start <malay>sampai habis</malay>
so you <malay>tengok</malay> the infinity wars <malay>semua tu</malay>
who fuck [sia]
wait why did this even happen like
how did this even happen
[orh]
no
[orh]
but now what he doing [sia]
is it
[oh] ya
<malay>ayam penyet</malay> [oh] the one at science block [ah]
after
I see serious
[orh]
I mean maybe it's just like the institutions [lah]
that's what he don't have
ya [sia] that [one] !wah! that [one] #shiok# [eh]
but
coney island [ah]
is literally coney island group
okay [lah] then we got one more year you want you want
[eh] no no no touch wood touch wood
go up
three to four hours right
!huh! no [ah]
I mean
I that day try to keep up with you all also I want to <malay>pengsan</malay> already bro
you don't need to stand just
sit down and pedal
[oh] ya ya ya that's true I think one of my friends like
he he does this like
me and #hasif# got the gazelles team
the #hasif#
ya then we got the gazelles team then one of them now is like a fitness trainer then I think he does spin
class quite cool [eh] and
but sad [lah] like the club like
gone already like we stopped
stopped playing
but then I asked #imran# [lah] like if after
like all these phase whether like once
eleven eleven a side then maybe my team can
play against his team think would be quite fun [lah]
I miss playing football [sia]
why [sia]
[orh]
is the clutch game [ah]
well cause like approaching the end right I think
it was hard to find numbers [lah] then
then I think #hasif# just ask him
to fill in the numbers but then ya [lah] quite inconsiderate also seeing that like he come all the way down just for
five minutes but
maybe first second or third season second season we got like some good players but then
they all like very selfish with the ball so then <malay>tak</malay> pass
and it's just play amongst themselves and me [lah] so is like
unfair to others [lah] so I think they decided to leave
but that one #safi# #jio#
so then they stayed for long they were good [lah] but then ya just selfish [lor]
is that the start of this year ya ya the start of this year april march there
ya but I wanted to play [sia]
I sign up for captain ball
then I got the sport
because like I really wanted to play captain ball then (uh) I wanted to play the first year but then
it's either captain ball or
but then captain ball
I think there was too a lot of people then
not enough for football so I had to drop one then since
football not enough then I just join football
ya I was the keeper
clean sheet twice
first game concede second game clean sheet third game clean sheet
fourth game clean sheet
then final game
(err) think final game I think concede one
but the goal was damn stupid like
like the guy kick not even hard
but then it bounce bounce bounce right then I dived then it bounced over my hand
then go in then !wah! I tilted
I have no clue I think I think the way he hit the
ball not a clean strike
but then it was like
so it hit the ground then it bounce then it bounce then
I misjudged [lor]
but by then they all would have played at right
!wah! #shiok# [sia] !wah! #shiok#
that's why I was like hope really hoping like
hopefully the COVID won't get in the way
then at least
we get to play one more time [lah] before before like
before
year two okay [lah] year two was fun [lah]
you have to travel with caleb they all
actually I was quite lucky [lah] they get to travel that [one]

not say backwards [lah] but not as up to date as like singapore's kind of
like technology like their technologies still
quite old [lah]
ya maybe ya cause that [one] was up a mountain [leh]
but it was quite cool [lah] then
try #soba# then the
(err) we learn about
their stroke management actually their stroke patients like I think it's a japanese thing to be like super positive even though you are like phase three
those kind of adversity
ya so it was quite an eye opening experience
then like this year this year never go #dublin# right
so actually going that japan thing was quite good [lah] so at least some of the mods cleared
you all also supposed to have trips right
taiwan [ah]
korea
korea
but is just one week though
ya ya ya [ah]
cause like
I see the price right then like
for one week is it really worth it like I feel you can go
can go on a holiday for one week
at that same place with like lesser expenditure [oh] ya that is true
ya [sia] ya [sia]
how you got learn [ah]
what you learn
no no as in as in what you what recipe you ya

ya [lor] that was like circuit breaker in a in a nutshell [lah]
it was just like at home doing nothing

they did all the exercise stuff and all that then put on
story ya ya that was like the hype [leh]
you me no you did

because there was that time when (err)
my parents were overseas in new zealand right then like I had to
I had to cook myself [lah] for that one whole week
then I go cook mac and cheese thinking like it's gonna be damn easy then I
I don't know how I screw it up [sia] then I eat right I can still the taste the flour [eh]
ya maybe [ah] probably probably
!wah! but that one whole week was quite
#shiok# [ah] having the whole house to myself
which was the best
what was the best recipe like
whether is solid
actually is like the recipe and the ingredients like all so simple but then when you actually get down to it right !wah! is actually
ya
but the
[ah] ya you use what

so like he when he cook the mushroom like he grill not grill [ah]
he pan fry the mushroom but he put like he put like (err)
butter on the pan first
then after that he put the mushroom
then he let it sizzle for awhile then he put salt
because the salt will like take out the
(err) take the moisture out
draw the moisture out cause when it's frozen right a lot of it is trapped inside [mah]
then after that he will
he will take
[oh] what he do after that [ah] [oh] ya then he will take
(err) like this
thing to <malay>kemek-kemek</malay> [kan] [ah] like press press

test (um)
<malay>tengok kalau aku nak bagi kau</malay> tips <malay>pun aku rasa tak manfaat kot</malay> cause <malay>kau pernah bilang aku</malay> that your course is design righ

I mean like for this current situation right now you can still go out with friends [ah] but to like limited places and with limited amount of people I think the max is like five people or somethin
(mm) like I say limited places <malay>sebab</malay> like some places <malay>pukul sepuluh dah tutup</malay> [seh] so <malay>macam</malay
like there's lesser option for you to lik
(mm) choose from I gues
(mm
ya that sounds like a good plan <malay>tapi</malay> like as I said (mm) <malay>semua orang pun</malay> busy <malay>aku pun busy juga</malay> since I'm looking full tim
bu
if you really want to go staycation (err) you need to tell me earlier so I can like plan my schedule and take leave
(um) ahead <malay>kau nak pergi</malay> staycation (err
<malay>kau ada ke</malay> hotel that you find interesting at the moment like any kind of promotion that you see or stuff like tha
(mm) actually that place one <malay>pun bagus juga</malay> [ah] I went there for my friend's birthday bash that was like pre period like before circuit perio
(mm
all I can say was that I remember the bed being comfy and I mean even there if there's like no pool right we can just chill and watch netflix and you know have food take away then we can eat at the hote
<malay>kalau ada</malay> room service <malay>pun baik juga</malay
(mm) talking about #shangri la# I came across the article <malay>dekat apa tu</malay> the smart local if I'm not wrong <malay>pasal</malay> the #shangri la
they actually having promotion where like I think you have one day staycation from like ten to eigh
and you are paid seventy five dollars per adult and the good thing about that promotion is that you can have access to all the facilities [ah] mean you can go like if you like water activities we can go do some kind of lik
don't know the pedal thingy I don't know what you call that or we can just hang out by the poo
I don't know [lah] it's entirely up to you I don't know I also don't know when the promo ends also I <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's end of this septembe
<malay>tak salah aku</malay> [ah
kno
(mm) (err) I mean like if really cannot find a like we really cannot go to shangri la there's other affordable hotels I guess if I'm not wrong you can use th
website agoda or something where you can find like a day hotel for you to hang out with my friend usually use that [lah] for like to surprise them for like birthday or something they always do that and (mm
what else [eh
<malay>aku dengar-dengar kau punya kawan pun kerja dekat</malay> #shangri la# how was the place like I know my friend work there before but has
waitress waiter if I'm not wron
he said the food there nice [lah] but <malay>tak</malay> halal [lah
(mm) ya maybe we should [ah] but we really have to plan well I guess I mean <malay>kalau tak boleh</malay> staycation <malay>pun</malay> I guess we can do other activities cause like there's a lot of dessert places and also like food places we can visit I have a list of it [lah] maybe I ca
take you out for dinner or something you can jus
you know walk around singapore see the sight view or something but nowadays rain [lah] so I scared [sia
how to say go out later rain no umbrella stuck in rain borin
ya I remember <malay>pemalas malas nak jalan</malay> [oh] I remember that cafe I think it's like hot chicks or somethin
(mm) if I'm not wrong my date went there before and he said that is not bad [lah] maybe [lah] we should we should go there but you have to find a time when it's not crowded and a lot of people (mm) if you really want to go cafe and like you know do some kind of activities righ
<malay>aku</malay> recommend <malay>kau pergi</malay> I mean we we can go to cat cafe <malay>dekat</malay> rail mal
very cute <malay>kau boleh main dengan kucing</malay> while you like have your dessert or some stuff (mm) cause I saw this on my friend's instagram and it looks really cute and the price is also not so bad [lah] it's affordable and other than tha
I also heard about this cafe called the mind cafe but this one also like a lot of people has been going there and it's crowded so you really have to find a time where there's not a lot of peopl
the mind cafe is just like <malay>macam apa ni</malay> you go there and then you order some drinks and you can play games like board games and stuff like tha
seems interesting but that malay cafe that you're talking about sounds really shady <malay>asal pergi sana aku pun tak tahu</malay>
oka
of cours
(uh huh
(uh) (uh) (mm) maybe can <malay>ajak ayu</malay> also [ah] bu
you know me I'm still awkward with her right cause like I never meet her for so long I also don't know what is she doing with life also like the last time I met her was whe
I accompanied her to her job to sign up for a job at this hotel I am not really sure but it's near suntec city or something like that then that was the last time I really like go out with her other than that I didn't talk to her I didn't text her or whatsoever it jus
<malay>pelik</malay> it's weird [ah] I scared I'm awkward with her I mean you you're closer with her I guess I don't kno
(err
I mean ya [lah] <malay>aku tahu</malay> during secondary school I was a nerd [lah] cause I was really focusing on like you know finishing my O's going poly and shit s
I mean I had a I I mean I talk to guys during that period but I don't think dating was an option cause I mean you look at our school [lah] <malay>lelaki semua pecah</malay> [sia
let's be honest can't they're I mean they are not <malay>pecah</malay> but they're not like you know nice people so I rather not be attached to the
(mm) but in pol
(mm) I don't really ya [lah] I I never reall
post if I have any like relationship or whatsoever because I feel like there's no poin
like you know posting online that I'm with this person or whatsoever as long as like me and him know that we're dating and he knows them well to tell other people that he's dating to
I will do my part also I guess you don't really need to show everything online [lah] for me [ah] cause <malay>aku rasa kalau</malay> if show everything online <malay>nanti kalau kau orang</malay> break what what you going to do all the pictures will be gone and it's a waste of effort plu
I don't know I just don't like sharing much I like to keep it low key to me [lah] the lesser people know the bette
like I will obviously I will tell my close friends [lah] that I I'm in a relationship and stuf

cause it's really really bad and I also heard about your manager your manager i
is not a very nice person [lah] as I can se
and I guess those I really think that delifrance or any kind of retail workers are underpaid [ah] I guess like having like seven fifty per hour or eight fifty per hour is not that sufficient especially you're working like part time part time only lik
a few days you can come to work [kan] <malay>macam tak</malay> fair [seh] <malay>kau tak akan</malay> earn <malay>tak akan apa ni</malay> hold <malay>duit yang cukup untuk sekolah</malay> and for your own like needs <malay>sebab aku tengok kau</malay> design <malay>kau selalu macam</malay

ya it's like that [lah]
(um)
okay then
why what did she say
is it really a is it really even even a break up
ya [lah] because honestly he like how to say say (uh) he says like back then like [oh] we're not together you know like we're just friends
but they act like they are together but the whole point of a relationship is the act [lah] not the just the label so basically he he was together actually because he like spend all the time with her
like they eat together then hang out together it's basically like dating [lah] even though he doesn't want to say that it's dating but the fact that it actually is what it is isn't even if he denies the the label and doesn't want to put the name on it
it is what it is you know
to what
when when was this
they will just they will just we'll we'll you and me will be third and fourth wheels [eh] no the thing is right they say they say they are not dating but they totally act like they are dating remember they do all those cringey things in front of us
!haiya! you know I don't know [lah]
like you know when when friends in like when two people in your friend group go date each other then they break up that just sucks [lah] it's like
it's just annoying I think it's just like why you all got to date each other can you just find somebody else outside your friend group
but that's what I want I think like if I want to find I'll just find someone out of my friend group cause like it's so annoying right like there's some some like friend groups will fracture because of a break up of relationship inside their friend group
shut up [lah] to shut up okay
shut up [lah]
just shut
okay
anyway (err) [oh] [ah] did you get your polling station place that you assigned to for the job

sunday I'm supposed to supposed to go meet adela and #menaz#
I can't be bothered [lah]
no (uh) the part with adela I'm just like
(uh) you know
what do you mean
no adela wants to meet us because she just broke up
she has but I (uh) I don't know I think she wants a guy guy's opinion I don't know
what is against her
cause she's cause she's being stupid that's why
it's not it's not the fact no I feel like it's just it's not her it's not just like girls it's it's her okay
it's like
she does okay she has a lot of problems
!wow!
the [ah] I already told you [what] that time feel a bit lazy to say
no like she has such a
she has such she's such a bad unhealthy view on relationships
like she so she's so disgusting how she treats she expects a guy her boyfriend to treat her like she she like keep saying like [oh] I I want a boyfriend so that he can buy me free food
[eh] you know all these all these movement by girls like all men are trash all men are trash kill all men you know what girls are actually trash also
no [ah] you're not [lah]
that's why I don't say all girls are trash [ah] like the the the the the phrase
but you know girls are equally trash also like I when I hear adela talk about how what her what her ideal guy is like damn disgusting [sial]
like she keep saying about
(um) she keep telling telling us like [oh] I want a boyfriend so he can buy me free food like so she can buy he can buy for me (err) clothes and I can take his clothes
it's like it's so materialistic and it's so like you know like she's like using the guy to spend on her
I think she's (um)
teachers and I think she's a middle class like okay
as a student in singapore you're basically poor that's what you are but she lives in a maisonette
and her father drives audi A five I think
ya but
I but you know that's the thing like okay your parents may be rich but you are not rich you know what I mean
unless like your they constantly give you money and like
ya that's still their parents money like once you're
like once you're how to say you want to marry or something or you move out the house
like are they really going to keep giving you money
she's stable [lah]
because she has that's exactly that's what I'm saying we keep saying men are trash girls are also trash okay
exactly and then that's what girls always say no [lah] (uh) when the girl's the exception they say (uh) no [lah] she's just the exception exception like
like [eh] enough
black lives matter
no she's not
no she too dense to think about it
sometimes no [lah] she doesn't
shut up
okay she's not attitude problem but she's just very bimbo to associates
and and then it's okay when back in secondary school when you're still a very young girl
but now that you are twenty two or twenty one is become has become very
like
just grow up you know what I mean like
you're supposed to be like matured already and
think about other people and like not have this kind of views but she's the same old adela from secondary school
(uh) it's just I think it's just
mostly down to herself
because if you you can't blame your your your your ex for
behaving a certain way also [what] like the only reason why you don't develop because you don't want to
mature yourself and like grow up you know I mean
how I know tinder instagram I don't know
what else man
nowadays nowadays is all
it's slide sliding to the arms

what
but he's been working so much
this is just one time and it's not even that expensive dude
no but the the thing is if he wants to rent that that tricycle thing it's way more expensive than renting a bike you know so it makes no sense
a double bike is way more expensive than a single bike okay it's not even like because it's double bike it's two times it's not
okay you can just ride on your own so I don't think that's the case
and and also and also

ya
[oh] I got my dates on eighth and and eighth of july and eleventh
ya you got what
you got nine and ten [ah]
wait isn't voting day just one day
I don't know actually
pioneer some people will vote on the ninth and tenth
so what do they do I if I setup on the eighth who's going to setup what on ninth
that's election officials that's that's not us we are doing setting up only
by because I know because my sister is
(err) election my sister-in-law is a election official
that means she'll be probably be there manning the polling booths [lah] the voting booths
ya she told me cause she she she also does the
does the she does the safety distancing ambassador thing like she goes around
like hawker centres making sure people practise safe social distancing
[eh] hello
of course [lah]
(err) no
I don't know got
if you go hawker centres they have as in like in groups of five cannot mix with another group of five okay for example
because got no safety distancing ambassadors there and everybody's an idiot
ya exactly they say groups of five go out then after that they go more than group of five groups of five they get corona then
serves them right
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] no [lah] okay [lah] no I just kidding [ah] but then like they already say [what] groups of five maximum but then they want to go break those rules
is it
I think ya the last five minutes right we try to speak malay
cause I scared got not enough malay
it's now forty nine thirty three for me what's yours
forty nine forty now
okay same
[eh] I feel really good about liverpool [ah] about man city beating liverpool
cause liverpool suck [ah]
they won already they won already
but man city beat them yesterday
no it's just a
no it's they won the the match
you understand but they didn't win the league
no okay a league how you win the league how you win the league
is that
you will
there's like thirty plus teams in the league right
so
you have your home and away matches
so basically (uh) you will fight every team at home so means your stadium and then you will go to their stadium and fight them again
so a win means three points
you your team earns three points
a draw means one point
and a lost is zero points
so basically
you have like sixty plus matches
in the league right
because it's just thirty times two [what]
so
you try to
collect the most points
(err) then the most points win [lah] win the league
so it reaches a point where hello
okay so they it liverpool reached the point in the
in the season where they
where they mathematically (uh) mathematically no other team can beat them on points
so that means they reached high enough far enough that
even if the second place team wins all the the rest of their remaining matches their points their point tally cannot go above
liverpool's
(err) point tally
so that's why they won the league
ya so they they want to win the league early [lah] so so to speak
it's it's fair [lah] as in like they were good that means they won it already that means they were they were good [lah]
ya it's fair
no how is that not fair how is that not fair
it's fair
ya
but so so liverpool already won the league
and then
(err) but you still have the remaining matches [what]
to be played
to be played
you cannot cut the league short because
even though first place has been decided second third fourth fifth sixth all the way to thirty has not been decided
[eh] wait I'm not sure how many teams there are I think is twenty four [oh] my god not thirty [ah] forget [ah] forget how many matches there are but you get what I mean
so [oh] my god wait it's not even thirty I think it's like sixteen or eighteen
can't be that many teams in a league
okay wait I think it's like
nineteen teams [ah] or some or forty or twenty teams [ah] twenty plus teams [lah] not thirty plus
so is twenty plus teams okay so
it was like so like you cannot stop the league at when the first place when the first place has been decided [what]
cause you need to find out who can come second third fourth fifth all the way to twenty plus all the way to the last right
and then the the three last teams will get relegated
they go down a league
they go to a lower division league
it means you don't compete in the premier league anymore
and then
the one in the lower division league their top
three
if I'm not wrong top three their top top three teams will go up to premier league
ya
so
that's how a season works
how's it so hard to understand
okay (uh) right now it's like fifty four
<malay>kita</malay> (uh) <malay>kita bermula berbual dalam bahasa melayu</malay>

slang malay like accidentally english words you just go inside

I think we can just end it [lah] [ah]
okay press the red button okay ya on the count of one on one okay like just now okay three two one

and this is #wafaidil#
pretty good you know and it's (uh) it's been an eventful weekend I've been spending a lot of family bonding time with my family (uh) spending I just spend today at the beach in #sentosa# and
and cause we had a lot of free time and considering it's gonna be another stressful week of work or study (err) this coming week
we just wanted to spend this last day of the weekend you know just playing around the sand throwing each other into the sea spending quality family time
what about you #hady# what have you done for this weekend
(um) personally I wouldn't say that it's insignificant [lah] I'm just gonna say that
there's a little room to improve cause as of now
unless innovation is kicked in and newer ways are produced
we can't really get any better cause it's already it already seemed flawless [ah]
and now it's just depends on like what are the different types of features being added to the newer phones and how important are these features and how frequent are they being used in our daily lives how does it improve the quality of life I would say that is one criteria that big brands such as apple should instill [lah] looking for newer features that can improve the daily quality of their customers
(um) one question I would like to ask you would be
do you think a phone should cost around
a thousand cause the new iphones I've seen when walking past those apple stores
were actually around a thousand [ah] for the iphone eleven max pro what do you think of the price tag and do you think it's worth it
(um) in terms of the mask in this hot weather we can't really do anything to
minimise its effect on us [ah] cause we always have to ensure that we have our mask on on public transport in our offices when we conversing with our perhaps colleagues and friends and
there's no way around it [ah] it's always (err) prioritizing our own safety over such comforts like [ah] fighting off against the heat [ah] and but what I would suggest
for you to keep up with this heat is to always drink a lot of water
<malay>minumlah banyak air</malay>
so <malay>bila kita dah peluh</malay>
[ah] more water is put in ourselves and we will <malay>kita akan rasa</malay> hydrated [lah]
okay my
(um) me personally I've been living with having to wear spectacles ever since I was a kid [lah] and
me as being someone very (err)
very (err)
I would say
fair on what I spend my money on
I feel that spectacles should be free [ah] cause I didn't ask to be born with (err) bad eyesight and
this is some this is a necessity to ask to contribute to the workforce so I think that it should be free for us to
you know see properly do better jobs at what we do
and yeah
that is something I could agree on [ah] for you know countries like switzerland providing [eh] countries like sweden sorry
countries like sweden providing free healthcare for their (um) their people and hopefully one day countries like singapore can also (err) adopt that (err) value of (err) taking care of their people's health [lah]
and providing certain free services for like I would say certain be better cause
(err) we do not we don't want to put our country in debt cause of the supplies needed for this medical you know and
I would like to ask you another question #hady# (um)
it may be seem out of context but (um) if you could have one superpower what would it be
(mm) after much consideration of like
[ah] me personally being someone who cares about my self image and what other think about me
I think I'd go with mind reading you know cause
is like you know whenever you go through your festive seasons you do your house visiting I just want to read the minds of the aunties inside the household and just like
think [ah] do they have a good image of me do they secretly have a secret hatred towards me cause I eat too much at their house
ya then you know it's a certain sentimental reasons just to
I just want I just want to read how people think about me and like
what they go through in life
how much better of a person I can cheat I can be towards them
to stop treating them badly understand their situation deeper detail cause I'll be reading their mind [lah] through through their eyes [lah] basically seeing their lives through their eyes
and you know that mind reading ability might come to might be useful for me during like exams cause sometimes you know you run run you run into hard [eh] hard questions which
you kind of overlooked when you were studying and you didn't know how to do so
why not mind read the smartest student who is just a few chairs away from you right
and get that higher mark [ah] and hopefully and through that
enter good uni you know
(err) back to you #hady#
[ah] and you can also read the minds of all the <malay>makcik-makcik</malay> what they are talking about between each other
you can just listen from afar right
(hmm)
ya yes of course you know (err)
throughout the our daily life you always think about a bit sometimes weird stuff that just passes by our mind and we don't want to (err) give off a wrong image to the person reading our mind [lah] cause
we show what we want to show to people we don't want to show them what we don't want to show
cause we know it's not right but it's still being processed in our brain so ya [lah]
<malay>nanti tak baik</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau orang tengok kita macam</malay> (err) <malay>orang jahat tapi padahal kita biasa-biasa</malay> [jer]
[ah]
(hmm) <malay>kalau aku</malay> I feel that
I <malay>aku akan belajar</malay> (err) what what's that photo photo memory
where you see something once
<malay>abeh terus boleh ingat</malay>
(um) this is useful cause when you're studying and you have to flip through so many pages from your textbook
and having this photo memory you can instantly pick it up
so as you as you're when you're doing your exam
this image will straightaway just pop up in your brain and you can copy word for word giving them the model answer
the second skill I would have to say would be (hmm) I've always been a big fan of gordon ramsay so probably cooking [ah] cause
(err) food is like such a wonder to this work there's so much unique taste there so much unique
(err) ingredients to be explored
ya unique fusions so me myself being able to learn how to cook really like
drives me [lah] to try out different things different you know different cuisines and learn them cook them in my [ah]
at at my convenience with my own mix ya
as for the third skill I would say right
is
being able to
make friends with anyone
(err) I feel that being social is quite important in my life cause like
(err)
I'm (err) I always have to interact with people in school in work
in in my own household (err) and (um)
somewhat lacking in the social department [lah] cause
(err) it always seem like I just don't mix well with people and
(err)
we just (uh) interested in different things [lah]
so that's just me and my (err) life relations [lah]
(err) <malay>masing-masing ada masalah sendiri</malay> [kan]
you know
for as for you #hady# <malay>kalau kau boleh</malay> master <malay>tiga benda</malay>
master <malay>apa</malay>
(hmm) me being a mobile phone kind of person whenever I do turn on the to watch
it would have to be either action
or stuff that is animated [lah] cause the movies like with actions or animations
are deeper appreciated if you view them on the bigger screen cause you view details that you would miss out on a small frame of a phone so with this big frame you notice every single detail every single [ah] intricate detail of like
explosions (um) (err) hidden features like like
somewhat of sudden appearance
(um) if
my favourite action movie would have to be the expendables [ah] cause
(err)
nearly all my favourite actors [ah] actors and actresses are in there my idol
<malay>abang sado</malay> arnold schwarzenegger
(err) there's also
(err) people like
(err) rocky [ah]
(um) not really him but (err) the actor for rocky [ah] <malay>yang dia naik tangga tinggi itu</malay>
[ah] he's always I've I recalled seeing him when whenever I was a child my parents would play his movie [ah]
ya I totally agree with you on your last point but I also
I would like to disagree with you about the romance [ah]
for me personally I feel that romance plots are always the same it's always the hero save the damsel
and then they just fall in love and get a happy ending
which is always being overplayed overplayed overplayed cause people want that idealistic ending and I feel like movie movie director should make a more
(um) diverse type of ending for example one of the lovers dies coming to the ending or like
[ah] the lover finds another lover you know to create different emotions [lah] of
in a love [lah]
(hmm) <malay>kalau aku</malay> [eh] <malay>nak jadi</malay> actor
honestly I would always go for my celebrity crush [ah]
mister johnny depp he has a very (err) mysterious unpredictable vibe towards him with his smoldering looks
you know he he just a hottie [ah] I would say
(err) but recently I've been hearing that he's been abused
by his (err) former wife [eh] [ah] by amber heard
it's kind of sad [lah] I just wish him the best [ah]
you
(hmm) so you're telling me you would rather be ryan gosling over johnny depp
who in the past has know been known for
you know dating a lot of beautiful girls over
this newcomer ryan gosling
or perhaps (oo) because of sentimental reasons you say cause he relates to you
similar [ah] I relate to (um) my johnny depp cause you know
well
<malay>kita dua-dua</malay> handsome you know and can relate
on that note
I can agree with you cause I've always been scared of ants and as you know ants always come in pax
and that has always been one of my fears growing up or being bitten by multiple ants so
when you say a hundred otter sized horses
an otter is not that small but that would be scary cause I would be overwhelmed whereas if I had to fight an
horse sized otter
I mean a horse is pretty big but
it's not an like an elephant big
so
ya I think I can I could somewhat stand a chance more more
to the
compared to the small otters [ah] [eh] small horses [ah]
knowing me right
I think that
if I were to put stuff inside time capsule
it would be
green tea [ah]
cause I've been drinking that ever since primary school [ah]
and then such a you know a singaporean drink
every single day auntie
one green tea [ah] and it's always so cheap you know it's like one one twenty one ten
ya and [ah] another item I would say is probably
(hmm)
probably a note to myself from the past (err) you know [lah]
when you're in the future you're in the past
you always want to know [lah] like what's your future self
would I be more <malay>gemuk</malay>
would I be <malay>lagi tinggi</malay> would I be (err) <malay>lagi kaya</malay>
(err) you you always want to ask yourself how you're doing [ah] basically a reality check from the past [ah]
and the third item I would put in there would be something that could last long
or gain in value like perhaps
my young self could persuade <malay>bapa</malay>
for his rolex you know
put it in a time capsule you know so for fifteen years for example
it has not been touched that rolex has been inside that box
who knows what the value could be by then you know it might be more it might be less but hopefully it would be more [lah] cause
<malay>lagi kaya</malay> [lah]
[ah] as for you #hady# what would you put inside
you could say we have
you could say we have pretty similar taste [ah] putting a note together
take [ah]
you want me [ah] one what do you have another question you would like to ask me
if if I had three wishes [ah]
honestly
me being me
I probably wish for a hundred billion dollars [ah] people say money can't buy happiness
but not for me [ah]
I could sponsor my parents trips to their <malay>haji</malay> every single year
how does that not make you happy
and I could also own
(um) like big houses by the ocean
and give them one to each of my siblings
for their families
so
I don't see why money can't buy happiness you know
these sentimental reasons are like
these big purchases can like improve our quality of life so
deeper appreciation for each other you know
as for the second wish right
[ah] I would honestly
wish for an air conditioned shirt
so that when cause singapore's weather is so hot nowadays
literally the moment you step out
you start sweating
so an air conditioned shirt
would be so useful in our day and time [ah]
of course (err)
you just keep your whole body cold you'll be more energetic
(err) ya you can just run about your day without having to be drenched in sweat having to worry about smelling bad
you know
quite a useful item to wish for to be honest
and as for my third wish I would
probably ask for
for me to hold my own concert [lah]
(um) me being me I've heard myself sing in the toilet a few times and
you could say I can hit them notes [ah] and
(uh) I've always idolized this K pop stars ever since I was young so I inspired to have my own concert with
people rushing over to see me perform
so ya those are pretty much
the three things [ah] that
I would wish for [ah]
okay
that's me with me that's me with the questions done how about you #hady#
what would you wish for
(um) those are very good wishes [ah] your first wish makes me (err) seems like a very stingy person and selfish [ah] cause
you'd wish for people to gain an access to an unlimited amount of money right
and whereas I prioritize myself [ah]
and as for your second wish I
really hope you could amend that [ah] cause who would want to be the owner of such a
buy in team and with no history
so no point supporting and being an owner of a team that has no backbone [ah] so if you could
I would suggest you (err) be the owner of liverpool instead [ah]
fair enough [ah]
[oh] that is very easy
that is very easy
for me
personally
I will eat #nasi lemak#
cause
(uh) actually no I will take back my I will take back my answer
actually <malay>kalau aku boleh makan satu satu benda untuk</malay>
the remainder of my life [ah]
probably #nasi ayam penyet# [ah]
it literally has all components I need [ah]
it has vegetables you know sometimes they put cabbage under the
fried chicken
they always give like slices of potatoes
[ah] there's always cucumber which is good
(err) of course [lah] the primary part [ah]
of course [lah] the
(um) primary part
of the dish of #nasi ayam penyet# which is the fried chicken
which is a great source of protein you know
and
and always a small kick of spice with the <malay>sambal belacan</malay> that is always given so ya I would say that's a pretty
pretty balanced meal for me to continue being happy and with my body [ah]
ya
so
if I could eat one dish
so #hady# if you could eat one dish what will you eat
(hmm)
quite quite a good reason sentimental I've went for the well balanced route you've went to
your mum's cooking which is
what what we eat daily
day to day like right now but
okay I would like to ask you one question
if you could
what is your ideal job
that you wish you be doing in the future
ya you can choose any job you want
(um) <malay>kalau aku</malay> [kan]
I would want to be a
(err) I would want to run my own radio like (um)
have you heard of the malay podcast called
okay let's go
yes that's something that I have
really been look look up to [lah] cause these three guys are
literally talking about the issues in singapore
without restrictions
they literally just
talk without boundaries cause
they have no limitations they speak on real problems
highlighting what
highlighting ya highlighting the problems
what could be done to (um)
(err) prevent such things from happening again
and they just a wonderful bunch [ah] they very humorous
and
considering they are three <malay>abang melayu</malay>
that [ah] that just quit their nine to five jobs and just
[ah] started a podcast which became singapore number one podcast is just
!wow!
if only I could do that with two other people
with someone budgeting us
<malay>aku</malay> guarantee you we would be a number one radio
(um) another job that I would be
probably the law law sector [ah]
<malay>daripada kecil</malay> I've
<malay>aku nak jadi macam</malay> lawyer <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> you know <malay>tolong orang</malay> [ah]
(err)
giving people that deserve judgement
the fair judgment [ah]
for example <malay>kalau orang dia jahat</malay>
that give him the proper (um)
punishment
I don't want I don't want to be a lawyer <malay>macam</malay>
they can be bought off [ah]
(err) you know there's always speculations that
judges are very biased nowadays for like
the cases
you know
just cause they have a four point O
they get excused from molestation
record people showering like
does that even makes sense [ah]
just cause they have a potential bright future
they can do all these nonsense I don't think so
<malay>gini semua merepek</malay> [ah]
then
ya I would try to be I would try to prioritize [lah]
justice [ah] over anything
and for my third job [ah]
honestly I would want something social [lah]
so perhaps
(err)
a singaporean tour guide
I've always been you know
pretty excited on meeting new walks of life in singapore
and you know just conversing
knowing what they like about singapore what they don't like
we have to know [lah] cause we we be pretty egoistic if we don't
want to know what they don't like us
maybe we can improve from there
and you know we can learn what unique about singapore
and in
meeting new people has always been a
(err) (err) a hobby of mine which I like [ah] cause you know
you have more friends
you learn more cause you're you've open up to more people
and different people act differently [ah] so
you would probably learn you know how
how people act
and adjust yourself accordingly [lah] if the people #macam#
<malay>kalau orang itu perangai jahat</malay>
you can learn
how to deal
<malay>dengan orang yang perangai tak baik</malay> in the future
<malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
back to you #hady#
<malay>kalau aku</malay> [kan]
(hmm)
for me personally
from what I've seen [ah]
I feel like <malay>badan sapau</malay>
<malay>lagi penting daripada kelihatan</malay>
[eh]
sorry sorry sorry I would like to take that back
I would like to say that good looks are more important than a fit body [ah] cause
(err) I've seen a lot of malay girls cause I malay
(err) I've seen a lot of malay girls fall for guys simply for their looks
they could be as skinny as a board
and they would get
<malay>semua perempuan melayu</malay>
you know
(um)
(um)
good looks over that one [ah]
cause they also keep in mind that they want
<malay>dia orang nak</malay> baby <malay>yang macam</malay> you know <malay>yang</malay> cute cute
they want to have like a good face so that
you don't get bored of them [ah] easily
apart from their good personality
there's also the complimentary of a good face
[ah] <malay>itulah yang</malay>
from what I ask my female friends [lah] female <malay>melayu</malay> friends
that's what they say [ah] how about you #hady# what you think
<malay>setuju</malay> [ah] <malay>setuju</malay>
there there's no point if you have good looks
<malay>tapi perangai macam</malay>
<malay>tak bagus</malay> [ah] simply said [ah] for what for what he looks good
but <malay>dia kurang ajar dengan kau dia tak jaga hati kau</malay> what's the point of all these if cannot that's why ya ya personally
out of the two options I would if only I could slot in the choice of personality (oo) then that's what I would choose [lah] primarily ya stick to good looks [lah]
okay (err) passing back to me I would like to ask you a question
why do you think the number one leading death cause for young people in singapore is suicide
why do you think so
(um) personally <malay>aku setuju dengan</malay> your opinion that <malay>hidup kita semua</malay> (err) is moving in a very fast pace [ah] and you all happening
it's all happening very fast and sometimes we don't have the time to like to comprehend and adjust to it [ah] so ya all these build up pressure would be
kind [ah] (um) kind [ah] does a heavy toll on us [ah]
ya and it's it's sad to say that personally I feel that in asian household
(err) mental health <malay>ini memang</malay> overlooked at [ah]
they just avoided [ah] like what you said it's like a taboo in our household
it is it is rarely talk about cause ya when our parents were growing up
they never really consider themselves they always thought of the consequences for example so what if their jobs were stressful
is better than being jobless
ya that's what they always thought but [ah] in this newer generation is good <malay>yang</malay>
[ah] <malay>kita semakin</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> (err) making it more of a
(err) raising awareness [lah] I would say (err) to this type of issue [ah] back to you #hady#
[oh]
(hmm) ya I agree with your statement
this that that change must be must happen we have to strive for more supportive family it's about supportive background you know
ya (err) okay time to turn (err) time to turn to happier pastures [ah] from this depressing (err) fix (err)
what would like to ask you right
about some things you appreciate about being a singaporean
some things you appreciate about being a singaporean
ya
(um)
as a singaporean something that I can be proud of and appreciative is
our public transport [lah]
I would say we have the best public transport cause
our buses nowadays are very clean very fast and
with the introduction of (err) electrical buses
very green [ah]
I would say we've been making an effort to reduce carbon monoxide (err) you know
to play our part in keeping singapore green country

like now you're in the process
I think after six months you already <malay>dah dah dah tak kisah</malay> ya

for you for him it's easy
because guys will have the mindset that they can get everything they get they want
serious serious they they can they will use that

(mm)
the thing is you don't know that's why
exactly
<malay>siapa</malay>
<malay>aku dah cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>dia dia kalau</malay> comfortable <malay>dengan orang tu dia dia selalu buat gitu</malay>

[eh] <malay>iya ke jazli</malay> and #izuan# handsome
then <malay>dia kata</malay> [a'ah] not bad why <malay>abeh dia cakap dia orang</malay> handsome <malay>ke</malay> because most girls find find them handsome
<malay>aku macam</malay>

#izuan# is like
he came into the picture later exactly
<malay>kau jangan</malay> #wei# <malay>sembilan belas ada yang dah tunang</malay> [sia]
<malay>dua puluh satu dah nak kahwin</malay> [seh]
<malay>izuan kau nak tengok kat izuan izuan ada apa</malay>

maybe ten percent ya
I'm not supposed to tell you
I mean you cannot tell [lah] but
I mean some other way <malay>kau boleh macam</malay>
okay you get the feeling
[oh]
ya exactly
I mean if you moved on already what can you say
if the feelings <malay>hilang</malay> already what
okay if caring okay
his one right I think his type of like <malay>macam</malay>
(err) his kind of
convincing or talk or <malay>apa apa</malay> [ah] in general
his type is to like <malay>macam</malay> lead you on
lead you on
ya
get you into thinking things that are otherwise the things
to get you into thinking things that
are otherwise that he thinks
okay
okay <malay>macam</malay> okay
#humairah# said that he still like <malay>macam cakap</malay> to you <malay>cakap</malay>
he talks to #humairah# about you right
K that makes you think he hasn't moved on right
but instead if you ask him that face to face he will say [oh] I just care care for you as a friend
ya exactly that's that's that's what I meant by he keeps leading on
[ah]
<malay>tu pasal</malay>
so you get what I mean now
that's why
don't high hope [sia]
(mm)
never ya just dont care about him move on zack is in front of you even if zack doesn't like like you again
maybe in the future maybe will
maybe now he's facing problems that's why he <malay>tak itu</malay>

<malay>ada beribu-ribu jantan</malay>

<malay>lelaki</malay>
right

<malay>susah</malay>
<malay>nak cari pun tak tahu mana nak cari bodoh</malay>
ya
<malay>terus dia</malay> reject

[oh] ya
why
[oh] okay now I get it because
okay [lah] now getting because I think he say because split I do number isn't [ah] linguine with me to select and mulberry is opposite [lor]
I think he said because <malay>kau dah bilang apa izuan alim gila semua dia solat semua</malay> [kan] zack is the opposite [what] that's why he feels like very competitive <malay>gitu dia tak suka</malay>
!alah! <malay>kesiannya</malay> you but did you tell him that
but did you tell him that
<malay>kau cakap apa dalam</malay> letter <malay>tu</malay>
!alah!
<malay>comelnya</malay> okay
[ah]
(mm)
so cute
but like if a guy if you know that he feels like that right
you should just tell him that <malay>kau orang</malay> together not because your expectation of a guy is
<malay>macam</malay> you should say that at least he tried it's easier
[oh] <malay>dia comel bodoh dia kata dia solat</malay>
now what time
okay I mean <malay>dia tak teruk seteruk aku</malay> [tau] but
but what can he do so
(mm)

you're telling me not to wear things
ya exactly
as a friend okay I understand
your point of view
but don't don't make it seem as if as if it's my fault for dressing like that and then I lure guys into doing it
[eh] you !wah! shit [sia] cannot [sia] like you can see my whole face it's not that obvious
ya even if I I asked #husni# you know
<malay>aku tanya husni gambar-gambar tu</malay>

(mm) and then <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>husni cakap</malay> maybe
(err) <malay>husni</malay> came to a conclusion he just said that (um)
because like (uh) that is why you shouldn't play dating app <malay>ni semua</malay>
ya then after that <malay>aku macam</malay> it's like <malay>aku cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> sometimes you just play the dating app just to get to know the person <malay>itu</malay> [jer]

I'm just gonna
it's very stupid if they ban that [lah] <malay>macam bodoh sangat</malay> [lah]

just did not know him or <malay>kau</malay> [dah] <malay>nampak muka dia</malay> and then you decide to go on a date <malay>dengan dia</malay>
it's always the cute guys <malay>yang buat kita orang macam</malay> like this
I think I think you <malay>kau ada cakap</malay> telegram [oh]
ya he was practically ghosting <malay>kau kesian</malay>
it is what it is
ya
actually [ah] I have one <malay>calon</malay> for you
and he is he is actually <malay>mak aku punya</malay> friend <malay>punya anak</malay>
so like but we kind of grow up together [lah] so <malay>sejak kecil</malay> until <malay>besar</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] the thing about him is the thing about him is <malay>dia pendiam</malay> so
[eh] no <malay>dia macam pendiam</malay> with certain people that's what I notice about him but but
the good thing is he is older than us by a year so I think it's like <malay>secucuk</malay> for you [lah]
no but you like you like guys who are older what you don't like guys who are younger than you right
<malay>adik-adik</malay> ya stop it [sia]
ya and the guy is soft spoken but then I know <malay>kau suka lelaki yang boleh</malay> fight <malay>dengan kau</malay>
but he's the only candidate that <malay>aku tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>yang</malay> I can recommend to you
no I I told you [what] he is my mum's friend <malay>punya anak</malay>
so like I <malay>kenal</malay> him from young and like my mum is friends with her friends <malay>sejak dulu</malay> so (mm)
(mm)
you you like guys <malay>yang suka bantah</malay> is it

no he's only mean to other people
I don't know you tell me is he is he like really <malay>kasar dengan kau</malay>
(hmm) I know actually now right is actually so hard to find a partner that is truly down to earth for you and really down
to to like date you and then to <malay>kahwin</malay> with you
actually (uh) after the truth or dare game right I thought <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>tak suka aku</malay> because like I feel like maybe
he feels <malay>malu</malay> because he had to do it so from then on <malay>macam</malay> it was like a forced thing to do and maybe he because of that <malay>dia</malay> just start to <malay>tak suka</malay> me
that's what I felt ya because that time when you know after that they ordered mac right
and [ah] I wanted a straw or something so I said [oh] !alah! can you pass me a straw I don't know why he like he just ignored me
then I am like wasn't the <malay>tak</malay> [oh] is he not at me
ya [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
she loves loves me
!huh! I don't think it was love yet because at that point of time I think he'll he'll still talking to his ex you know <malay>kau tahu</malay>
<malay>dia masih berbual-bual dengan</malay> ex <malay>dia</malay> [seh] ya
ya and then [ah] he was actually low key hoping to get back with his ex but then his ex was just like [eh] I don't know
ya
yes yes there was the story then [ah] you know then after that I <malay>teman</malay> him to go for one office <malay>takraw</malay>
<malay>punya</malay> sessions just to watch [lah] and then we were walking to the sports hall <malay>abeh</malay> I think <malay>kawan dia</malay> saw us walking in and then his friend took a snapchat then [ah] <malay>kawan dia</malay> upload to
snapchat and then [eh] his ex <malay>nampak</malay> [lah] then
(err) his ex message him and ask I thought I thought there was still something between us
yes <malay>dia</malay> playing hard to get but then she's also like <malay>macam</malay>
not sure about him but also playing hard to get <malay>macam mana</malay>
so <malay>dia orang dah</malay> break up [lah]
exactly
like
exactly there is my point that is what I mean
but
ya ya
[ah] <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak suka</malay> when like (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> girlfriends are like so insecure of like the boyfriend <malay>punya kawan</malay> I mean just make it clear [lah] that
you guys just <malay>kawan</malay> and like the girl should understand
so she's like being two faced is that what <malay>kau</malay> mean by that <malay>ular ular kepala dua</malay> is it
what
it's not just
how will wait so the guy is gay
[orh] okay okay [dah]
for years
but why would the girl <malay>buat</malay> such a thing to the <malay>mata air</malay> [sia]
I mean I don't know that guy
so <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's okay if you want to <malay>buka aib dia</malay> to me because I don't even know who he is so
(mm)
wait so does that mean at some point <malay>kau pernah suka lelaki tu</malay> on
[oh]
(um)
ya
like <malay>kau orang</malay> are just platonic friends [lah]
the <malay>mata air dia</malay> just have issues [lah] I think because remember remember when <malay>aku</malay> used to have issues dengan #yasmin#
ya
I don't even know why and then now <malay>kita</malay> we're friends so like look [ah] the turntables
no is is is it is it the office reference <malay>entah</malay> [lah]
speaking of the office you know my sister [ah] I told my <malay>kakak</malay> about (uh) all my internship drama in the office it was so dramatic and then she is like
maybe (err) your boss should hire a cameraman and then like cameramen will like every time when there is a fight in the office
the cameraman <malay>kena</malay> zoom in so it's like more dramatic and then
and then (uh) <malay>dia akan</malay> (uh) bend into like the people around <malay>dia punya</malay> reaction that will be so funny and then the title should (err) the office two point O
ya
well anyways I didn't tell you about one of the main drama in my intern office
so basically [kan] [ah] logistics and accounts just cannot get along for some freaking reason and then
<malay>aku</malay> is the middleman because I'm the intern and I'm supposed to <malay>buat kerja</malay> for both finance and logistics
but then again finance and logistics are supposed to work together because like if they don't work together how are they <malay>macam</malay> how is the company going to <malay>maju</malay> right and then
and then so I have to be the middleman so for finance I have to scan (err) purchase order and invoices
and then after I no I will get a purchase order and invoices from logistics to do it for finance <malay>habis tu</malay>
[ah] after I scan and then I will pass to the finance person [lah] and then <malay>mesti perempuan</malay> finance <malay>ni pun cakap</malay>
<malay>asyik</malay> pass <malay>kat aku</malay> [seh] this one you pass back to (err) <malay>si</malay> logistics <malay>dulu</malay> then I'm like
what do you want me to do with this after this is <malay>dah kerja kau</malay> [pe]
(mm) it's like <malay>macam</malay> as if they make it look like <malay>macam aku tak nak buat kerja padahal</malay>
they are the ones that making <malay>kerja aku susah</malay> you know so frustrating
(mmhmm)
(um) I I get what you mean though because <malay>macam</malay> [oh] at
speaking of work also you not because of the COVID <malay>kita kena</malay> work from home
so I have to bring back my laptop and usually <malay>kat kerja</malay> I will use desktop
but then like you know laptop is so <malay>kecil dari</malay> desktop and it's so hard to navigate things and plus the system is so screwed up and is always hanging
and plus I'm still new to the system
and then [oh] and then <malay>aku punya</malay> boss every damn day <malay>dia akan suruh kita</malay> on zoom and he'll have a meeting with us
(mm) I mean [ah] almost <malay>hari-hari</malay> [kan] my boss will <malay>tanya</malay> everyone [oh] what is on your plate today what is on your plate today like
<malay>macam</malay> every damn day <malay>hari-hari</malay> nine thirty sharp zoom meeting without fail <malay>dia akan tanya</malay>
[ah] my office hours is nine thirty to six thirty
[ah] you end earlier [what]
about one hour
<malay>lima belas minit</malay>
ya
from
(um) #kim# #yam# road <malay>nak pergi</malay> #sengkang# okay [lah] and then plus you know <malay>bila nak pergi</malay> and <malay>balik lagi kerja kena naik turun bukit</malay> [oh] my goodness
so tiring
ya so depressing <malay>tu</malay> turbine intern so !huh!
what topic though
J J
[oh]
#jannah#
!wah! so <malay>jangan</malay> [lah]
is it #jannah# <malay>dari mata air</malay>
<malay>kau tak</malay> [eh]
who who who do you have in mind to be #jannah# <malay>mata air</malay>
but
honestly I cannot wait until #jannah# <malay>kahwin</malay> though because like
I will feel so happy for her <malay>macam</malay> yes
I know right
any guy <malay>yang dapat</malay> #jannah# is a very very lucky guy
is it
no because you <malay>kau tahu</malay> [pe] I don't really have a lot of friends especially especially guy friends
!hey! what do you mean by that
no my cousins
<malay>sepupu aku</malay> they are either <malay>lagi tua</malay> or they're younger than me
so like I don't think #jannah# will be interested in <malay>dia orang</malay>
allan no no no no allan's cousins already have [ah] girlfriends and one of them is younger than him and I knew #jannah# <malay>tak suka lelaki yang</malay> younger than her
so like scrap that
it has this is a very hard thing to do
[kan] <malay>saya ni</malay> like #shaza# really <malay>shaza pula jap</malay> I mean you deserve the best also but #jannah# also like deserves the best
why (ugh)
we
we all deserve the best
feminism and empowerment [oh] my god speaking of empowerment do you hear about the elections
it's so <malay>merepek</malay>
did you know did you know that kanye west is really running for president
it's like americans don't even take <malay>dia orang punya</malay> elections seriously and some are actually voting for kanye
ya
you know actually actually [ah] should take notes from singapore and make voting
a compulsory thing and not give them a choice because that I see
<malay>orang dekat</malay> <malay>dia orang</malay> like [oh] have you registered to vote
I mean you have a choice to register or not
ya but
to get whether you get involved or not in politics
it's your <malay>masa masa hadapan</malay> that you are thinking of it's the <malay>masa depan masa hadapan</malay> of your children
so like
you get what I mean right
yes
[oh]
did you hear about the woke culture thing
especially <malay>kat</malay> singapore
tweeted I know you deleted you have twitter but like
woke culture has been like taking over singapore <malay>punya</malay> twitter and it's really really annoying especially those influencers
[oh] woke W O K E
it like it's <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] (um)
are you guys have to be woke in order to like <malay>macam</malay> so you guys don't [ah] offend <malay>siapa-siapa</malay> I'm like (ugh) stop it stop it
ya
but
<malay>macam</malay> no offence na na na na na but ne na na na
demographic
ya
ya
you know actually [ah]
(uh) actually women <malay>dia orang minta</malay> for equality I think like the proper word though use is not equality but the proper word to use is actually equity
ya call for equity
ya cause it's like
no no no no not not financial management it's (uh)
<malay>macam</malay>
being fair to both genders but added but at the same time [ah] seek catering to their needs better it's like <malay>macam</malay> for example you're looking over fence [ah] this guy can see because over the fence because he's tall but then
these (uh) but this other person cannot see so if you give both of them
ya actually I know
<malay>aku tak mahu bual pasal apa ni dah aku dah melalut</malay> okay nevermind
cancel that's wrong theory
ya

<malay>tak</malay> made a difference many ways was like the two best years of my studying life

I feel like
like
<malay>macam</malay>
it's like you seriously can just be yourself and people won't judge you make fun of you
and like it's just so <malay>lepak</malay>
and
ya I just miss so much and the lecturers actually do give a damn about you and your welfare not just <malay>kau punya</malay> studies

it's a good it's really a good show it's like doctor romantic [kan] so it's like <malay>macam</malay> (um) is obviously there's but but obviously korean drama obviously <malay>ada</malay> that love scene and stuff right cause it's between two people right but then (um) I wouldn't really say so I feel it's okay though
korean drama in general I think it's quite I mean for the ones that I have seen I think <malay>kirakan</malay> about the love scene the love story all that is quite okay [ah] ya to me [ah] so I watched the doctor romantic first [lah] <malay>yang</malay> first <malay>tu</malay> so it was that that show is about <malay>apa banyak</malay> doctor doctor <malay>punya</malay> scene [ah] so it's like <malay>banyak</malay> so <malay>jadi punya tempat punya</malay> scene !wah! you know at first I was like when I first thought about that show was like [eh] can I actually watch because if I'm not wrong I used to be a bit disgusted by like surgery <malay>punya punya apa nama dia</malay> what do you call it (uh) surgery <malay>punya</malay>
ya the videos and scene
it's it's it's really they they they really take a video of you like cutting the cutting the
it's very cool I tell you [ah] you know when I watching I was like bro this is

it's jut so even though is like just hoodie and like
I guess because when you see the like the actress and actors <malay>pakai</malay> [oh] my god <malay>cantik</malay>
[kan]
just pleasing to the eyes [lah]
but honestly though to think about it right they use the same equipment and they can buy the same clothes and like everything can be the same [tau] like as in like but it's just that why can't it why <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>macam tak sama</malay> [tau] <malay>aku aku pun macam</malay>

(uh) I think so
[oh]
<malay>itu itu cerita-cerita macam gitu aku tak suka</malay> but I think I remember <malay>dulu bila</malay> back then also <malay>selalu tengok</malay> because <malay>selalu bila kecil-kecil</malay> [kan] <malay>mana kita ada macam sekarang ada ada</malay> box [kan] you know the android box that kind of thing
the [one] that can like watch all the channels and all the different [one]
ya ya you can watch movie use that also so it's like
<malay>dulu mana ada benda tu semua</malay> [kan] like <malay>macam</malay>
ya so there's always a singapore <malay>nya</malay> channel so <malay>dah tengok</malay> singapore <malay>nya</malay> channel <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> like <malay>main tekan-tekan dengan dia punya</malay> button <malay>tu semua</malay> [kan] so <malay>kita tengok</malay> [ah] like some of it <malay>macam</malay> all the <malay>apa nama dia</malay> channel one is it <malay>yang</malay> all that dub basically that thing [lah]

it's it's just not pleasing to the ears ya it's it's like it's not synchronise same to like you look you look but you hear you different
I think ya [oh] my god okay even <malay>aku rasa</malay> even <malay>kalau dorang kalau</malay> #park seo joon# <malay>cakap dalam bahasa melayu aku pun tak suka</malay>
!huh! but imagine he talking malay though
but ya I cannot [lah] watch that kind of show I just need the original <malay>punya</malay>
actually okay
[oh] ya
ya
<malay>bodoh</malay>
ya but honestly for me also [kan] <malay>kalau tengok</malay> (um) subtitle <malay>dengan</malay> drama at the same time <malay>macam kadang-kadang aku tak suka juga</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab</malay> you know you wanna
for real
okay I guess I I am I am like that to a certain extent
because okay honestly right okay I feel I'm (uh) is it called visual learner visual visual person I have to ya because <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
<malay>aku dengar</malay> [jer] [kan]
[kan] <malay>sama sama</malay>
ya
ya exactly
but then but then you know sometimes <malay>kalau macam</malay> I mean not not (um) not korean drama also like like anything [ah] because I also want to see their facial expression their like the way they like <malay>macam</malay> make faces so is like <malay>macam</malay> if you keep looking at this subtitle then like and like and like like the drama then <malay>macam</malay> you skip some parts of the cute cute moment or like the funny funny moment so I'm like
what you mean I <malay>tak faham</malay>
[oh] no the the translation the translation is like very <malay>macam</malay> so formal right the word

ya [lah] ya [lah] I mean that's why I was like wondering <malay>asal sampai</malay> science centre <malay>sebab</malay> from here but
(um) it's I guess it's (um)
ya ya ya but I wouldn't say it's behind [lah]
ya
ya to the side ya
so it's like ya #taman jurong# so I'm like <malay>dari situ</malay> then <malay>boleh jalan</malay> [pe] that's why I was like science centre <malay>asal</malay> [seh]
for real
(hmm)
(hmm)
(uh) ya
[ah]
gosh I hate myself
!wah!
<malay>aku sedih tengok kau</malay>
because there's two short cuts
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>semalam kau pergi datang rumah aku kau</malay> confident <malay>sangat tu blok aku aku macam mana kau</malay> [eh] <malay>kau cakap kau dah sampai</malay>
that's why bro what the hell
[oh] my god
how how dumb ass can you be [sia]
what bull bull ass is that I don't think that's a good reason though
I
ya I mean <malay>kau dah berapa tahun kau dah berapa tahun</malay> [eh] <malay>kita semua dah berapa tahun</malay> obviously we have to be like independent
ya
ya
[oh] ya
!wah! you know I know had like that dream or like that thought of like <malay>macam</malay> okay so <malay>dah nak dekat kiamat</malay> [kan] so like why not I <malay>apa pergi apa nama dia orang cakap</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau nak kiamat nanti kalau pergi kalau duduk dekat</malay> #madinah# <malay>ke</malay> #makkah# <malay>ke kau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>jumpa dengan dajjal</malay> [kan] so I was like okay yes but then you know what I didn't know the thing about this when (uh) one thing <malay>yang aku tak tahu</malay> is that <malay>dorang cakap</malay> that <malay>apa nama dia</malay> even even <malay>orang yang duduk kat</malay> #makkah# <malay>dengan</malay> #madinah# (um)
no no no you <malay>dajjal</malay> can never go inside never never because it's really ya it's protected by all the <malay>apa malaikat</malay> [ah] so like <malay>macam</malay> but then the thing is within #makkah# and #madinah# there will be a a earthquake or there will be tsunami [tau]
in in the end of times [ah] so there will be so (uh) because of that tsunami or earthquake it will <malay>keluarkan orang-orang yang</malay>
<malay>beriman gitu</malay> [ah]
you wear this strong enough to you [ah] can react how which way because you can never picture yourself on that day itself [what]
[ah] that means because of the tsunami and earthquake that is inside #madinah# and #makkah#
no no they will they will stay in they will stay in <malay>itu</malay> so <malay>yang yang kirakan yang nak selamatkan diri</malay> they will <malay>keluar</malay>
so the
<malay>yang</malay>
<malay>dorang akan</malay> stay inside so that's why <malay>yang</malay> so that's why I was like thinking <malay>abeh kalau macam tu kalau</malay> in the end of times <malay>kalau aku pergi sana juga</malay> then what's the point though <malay>sebab</malay> because I own self don't know whether I am
the thing is in singapore <malay>kau mana ada</malay> experience tsunami or earthquake <malay>pun</malay> [kan]
ya you know you know that time <malay>aku pernah pergi</malay> japan <malay>dengan sekolah aku pergi sana</malay> for school trip [lah] [kan] so then <malay>lepas itu aku</malay>
[oh] <malay>itu pun</malay>
[ah] australia <malay>dorang apa</malay> #afini# (uh) <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>tak bukan</malay> #atikah# #ella# <malay>dengan</malay> #alia# <malay>dorang pergi</malay> melbourne so <malay>aku pergi</malay> japan <malay>dengan</malay> #puteri# <malay>dengan</malay> #ifa# so <malay>aku pergi sana</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (um) [kan] you know japan always earthquake tsunami all that big big <malay>apa gitu</malay> [kan] so
so
ya so <malay>kita</malay> (uh) <malay>yang aku pergi masa tu aku pergi</malay> #hiroshima# <malay>dengan aku pergi</malay> #osaka#
ya ya ya ya ya so exact obviously it's a school trip so obviously you have to learn about all the
yes history all that so <malay>dah pergi sana tu nak kena belajar pasal</malay> history [kan] so <malay>dah alang-alang belajar</malay> history <malay>kita nak kena belajar</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> we went to this <malay>macam</malay> ambulance place [eh] not ambulance <malay>macam</malay> fire place <malay>gitu</malay> to like learn about <malay>macam</malay> ways to like save yourself from like <malay>apa</malay>
ya all that so the was this simulation when we did wait actually [ah] we did a earthquake <malay>punya</malay> simulation
bro <malay>kau tahu sebab dia ada</malay> stages [tau] <malay>bila</malay> that simulation [kan] <malay>aku pergi</malay> we all had to take turns going [ah] I try [ah] because they say when you go you have to like protect yourself [ah] just anything to protect yourself
so <malay>aku pergi sana aku macam</malay> so there's like different different (um)
<malay>apa</malay> ya
ya so it's like (uh) they all of us if I'm not wrong all of us they give us (uh) <malay>yang</malay> medium or towards the high a bit just to <malay>rasa rasa</malay> [kan]
not not even the worst bro because it's because I think that's
it's just the tip of the iceberg [ah] you think just a bit [ah] <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
it's not the worst [ah] it's not the level seven [ah] it's like level four or five <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia kasi kita</malay> try [kan] <malay>kau tahu aku dekat situ aku bergegar</malay> [siol] it's really it's really like <malay>bergegar</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> I can't even like
are you sure
I see I see I see
<malay>jap</malay> so <malay>kalau kita</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> okay so <malay>kalau kita tengah</malay> earthquake <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>kita boleh masuk sini tak</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> as in like as in like it's not a good place right <malay>sebab benda ni</malay> [kan]
right so like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kat bawa</malay> [jer] [kan] but then <malay>jatuh juga</malay> so like
<malay>tak dorang cakap</malay> [kan] because <malay>kalau kau tak ada tempat untuk</malay> cover [kan]
[ah] <malay>kau kau guna</malay> anything to cover yourself just to like <malay>macam elakkan benda jatuh kat kau</malay>
ya ya ya so because <malay>kau punya</malay> head <malay>yang paling</malay> important [pe] <malay>dia yang dia yang</malay> control everything right
ya so that should be fine already so that's why [ah] <malay>macam apa nama dia</malay> (um) they just say make sure just protect your head with anything and everything that is hard or like <malay>macam</malay> wooden <malay>ke apa ke</malay> as long as you protect your head then it should be fine already
[oh] I know
ya [oh] my god that [one] <malay>sedih juga</malay> though <malay>kalau kau punya kalau kau punya kepala sakit tapi</malay> I mean okay <malay>tapi kau punya kaki dah</malay>
[ah] and like <malay>kalau dah penyek kau</malay> confirm <malay>nak kena</malay> amputate
[kan] but I mean
you know I was like thinking how can I be so lucky to be in this country in this religion in this like family
I'm like
what a what a blessing [sia] so much blessing in one time [tau]
ya
it wasn't a couple years back
but a few years
[ah] I see I see
pandemic
but
but it's not as bad as this [oh] that [one] was it before SARS or no
I think it's before SARS
[ah] <malay>itu itu lama gila</malay>
(mm)
[ah] it wasn't
[oh]
I know it was a big thing in singapore [ah] but it's just for what because we were
ya so that's why a bit scary [ah] <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
I think ya it it wasn't a pandemic [lah] but if I'm not wrong from what we heard is <malay>apa kirakan</malay> it was a sudden thing right that's why
I think they after awhile they handle it quite well [lah] like <malay>sekarang</malay>
[eh] is there I'm not sure though is there I mean I don't think so if I'm not wrong they say there isn't any
it looks a like flu [ah] like you know COVID is like a flu also
ya if I'm not wrong if I not mistaken
ya ya so
[kan] [kan]
[kan]
<malay>kesian dok</malay>
[kan]
but then again if you think about it the possibilities of you getting the virus in singapore what's the possibility though
singapore actually <malay>dapat</malay>
[kan]
it's good that <malay>kita kecil</malay> [ah] cause <malay>kalau kita kalau kita besar</malay> confirm <malay>tak boleh</malay> control [ah] <malay>sebab</malay>
(hmm) <malay>lagi nasib baik kat</malay> singapore <malay>ada banyak</malay> quite a number of (uh) hospital [kan] and the hospital is like
ya then every region I think <malay>ada</malay> quite a number at least at least two [ah] ya then now cause <malay>sekarang</malay> they are all starting to built community hospital
ya
community hospital basically
if I'm not mistaken community hospital <malay>yang</malay> all the firstly is all the very minor minor <malay>punya</malay> sickness [ah] are like fever all that flu I mean just that small small thing [lah]
yes not for surgery kind of thing
ya it's also
ya ya
and it's also for people <malay>yang</malay> from the major hospital transfer to
yes yes yes
ya that's why
I mean #ng teng fong# <malay>ada</malay> community hospital
ya
that's why
ya
<malay>tak apa pun</malay>
ya so that's why so <malay>sekarang dorang dah buat</malay> community hospital <malay>kat sini</malay> so I guess if I'm not that time <malay>aku pergi</malay>
<malay>mana</malay> [eh] woodlands <malay>ke</malay> east side east side or north side <malay>aku pergi aku pun nampak</malay> they are like trying to built something then it looks like <malay>macam</malay> community hospital also <malay>dari luar</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab kadang-kadang kalau kau tengok</malay> renovation [kan] then <malay>nanti dorang akan kepung tempat tu</malay> [kan]
so like you can see like all the you know like <malay>kalau</malay> for houses I don't know if you know [ah] but for houses [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> they will show like pictures of houses ya houses
ya that kind of thing then <malay>kalau</malay> for hospital they would show hospital <malay>punya itu</malay> ya so <malay>macam</malay> from the outside we can
I kind of saw like <malay>macam</malay> that that thing [lah] so I was like [oh] I guess because <malay>kalau rumah pun sekarang rumah rumah</malay>
I mean is <malay>sekarang banyak gila</malay> foreigner <malay>datang sini</malay> [seh] like <malay>banyak gila</malay>
ya but in the first place there is so many
ya
expats expats
I didn't know expats were okay sorry expats ya
actually <malay>sekarang</malay>
wait so <malay>bapa kau masih kat sana</malay>
!alah! <malay>sedihnya sorang-sorang</malay>
ya
true true true
[oh]
oil <malay>abeh kalau kat sini masa itu dia kerja apa</malay>
[oh] #jurong# island
[ah] <malay>tapi kalau</malay> oil but he's not really in contact with oil [lah] right he's just like
I mean <malay>baju dia kau dah cuci</malay> actually that time [kan] <malay>bapa aku sebab bapa aku kerja</malay> airline [kan] so <malay>dia pun nak kena</malay> fix fix all the aeroplane <malay>punya</malay> stuff right
ya then that's why that time [ah] I don't know don't know whether it's a
[ah] ya it's time <malay>kerja</malay> cause <malay>dia cakap dia balik rumah</malay> then <malay>dia nak kena tukar baju</malay> because <malay>apa dia terjatuh</malay> oil ya then I was like I was like shit <malay>apa bau</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
it so strong <malay>macam</malay> toxic
ya but then actually <malay>kalau kau pergi</malay> I don't for you but for me <malay>aku kalau pergi</malay> what is it called petrol station <malay>aku suka bau dia</malay>
low-key <malay>tapi aku macam</malay>

<EX2>cheebye< [sia] that [one] serious [sia]

but what course that they have
I want to be <malay>cikgu</malay> [lah]
<malay>aku nak jadi cikgu melayu</malay> [lah]
<malay>boleh jadi</malay> teacher <malay>belajar pun belajar</malay> part time part time science <malay>dah</malay> science <malay>lepas tu belajar</malay>
ya

no I have no patience in that
wet wipe <malay>tu kat depan tu</malay>
<malay>nak pinjam tadi</malay>
but I'm taking pharmaceutical science so what course I can get [ah] let me check [ah]
<malay>ada ke</malay> nursing
ya
yes I can psycho you
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
application fee [ah]

okay
why
then <malay>buat</malay> [lah]
<malay>jap aku tengah cari</malay> [lah] <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [ah] how to apply
[ah] july admission and then I should take july intake
I think by the time by the time you graduate from your diploma [ah] when april or july itself

ya by the time july <malay>dah boleh</malay> just nice [lah] to apply <malay>sekolah</malay>
[eh] why so good can use account
!yay!
how much you left
how many thousand
!huh!
but how much you left left balance when you when you apply
[eh] then where the rest how come your account
but wasn't that much right
the one that you do full time
my god but it's like [oh] so you left I thought [oh] you left like two thousand
[ah] e-application fee is sixty four dollar twenty cents
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>mana</malay> part <malay>tu tempat tadi</malay>
(mm)
to begin this we view the application guide let's submit your application
ya inclusive of
because <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh)
because mine I got around I think fifteen K I I thought I got eight K only [eh]
[ah]
but by the time you working you already working full time [what] they should
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
I go then I go to but is under private [what]
consider
(hmm)
psychology [lah]
<malay>aku pada</malay> that time <malay>memang aku nak ambil</malay> psychology <malay>apa</malay>
so that that [one]
that pharmaceutical science is much more <malay>susah</malay> than psychology [sia] actually
ya because my friend said that they you have to <malay>halal</malay> [tau] like legitly <malay>halal</malay> and #rizal#
[ah] sister
(uh) said that the thing is going to be a bit more
I don't know she said it's much much I think it's difficult
(mm)
<malay>macam mana nak tengok macam mana nak tengok dia punya</malay> school [ah] how much is the course
(mmhmm)
how come forty and above is six thousand plus only
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
this [one] should get for him

the
(mm) (mm)
[oh] okay [lah] just nice
so I don't need I don't need to pay extra

ya I think I'm prepared for this
okay [lah] at least at least I just need to ask him to
pocket up the money
so I can get married [seh]
okay [lah] as long he he support we support each other I think shouldn't be any problem [lah]
<malay>cuma nak kena tahan sabar dengan dia punya perangai</malay> which is
he will blue tick me when he is busy
and he will get back to me later
it's not [ah] because
for me I understand that he's working because for me he still even though he's busy he will get back to me
after that so okay
I don't like to control him also [lah] it's like it's your
you are big enough to know what's what is right what is wrong [ah]
so there's no need for me to keep on telling you
this and that okay you're not a five year old boy that I can just like <malay>macam nak kena bilang kau</malay> [oh] you <malay>tak boleh buat gini</malay> you <malay>tak boleh buat gitu</malay> okay you're not a five year old kid okay
[ah] so for me you should know your courtesy and you should know [what]
what is right for you what is wrong for you [lah]
<malay>macam tu</malay>
<malay>dah besar panjang</malay> [kan] <malay>dah tua dah tua bangka</malay> [kan]

<malay>tengah hari</malay>
[ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
(mm) okay
I long time never walk already [leh]
(mm)
is this the only course that they have
I don't know I should take counselling or should just take psychology this question be the best
biomedical <malay>pun</malay> okay [lah] engineering but (ugh)
no it's not
[ah] to challenge myself
because somebody said I have no life so ya
#rizal#
(mmhmm)
I just give her the look
just give him the look you see you wait you wait [ah] until I do diploma you shut up also
just to shut his mouth [ah]
sorry [ah] my critical thinking is way better than him okay
in a way
(mm) someone with depression [ah]
no
because I myself is already mental health problem
I got
I got anxiety
[ah] it happens
no but in a way the doctors
can see that I have a very bad I have a very bad anxiety when when I lost my mum
the counsellor the counsellor actually saw saw it happen
so it's like no no no I don't need a hug
ya so that what happen when I have psychology problems then eventually slowly I'll get get out of it
then sometimes it came [lah] but it just
sometimes when it came [ah] when it <malay>datang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam kau tak tahu</malay> [tau] <malay>macam kau tu tu tu cam rasa sawan gitu</malay>
you start to gag
you start to <malay>macam</malay> you feel that <malay>macam</malay> the bad energy coming
so [ah] there's this one point of time I think [ah] #rizal# saw it a few times
because when we (um)
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>aku buat</malay> [eh]
I just talk to him <malay>macam biasa</malay> [tau] <malay>nanti</malay> at that all sudden I will start crying
I will just start crying
then it's either that
or I will start to have gag reflex
ya
[ah]
but it only comes like <malay>macam</malay> if really really I'm really under a lot of stress
(mm)
but right now <malay>dah</malay> random [lah] because I think because I'm busy with work
but I partly I will be a bit stress [lah]

I think somewhere in october
[ah]
no no no this is my friend ya <malay>kawan aku lepas tu</malay> (um) bestfriend <malay>aku</malay> miscarriage after that
after her is me (uh) before before her is me
no #rizal# only know
I was in the logistic duty [lah] <malay>aku angkat berat</malay>
so <malay>aku</malay> I didn't realise I didn't realise I was pregnant also at that point of time
until (uh) my period came a bit earlier
which it came with very
a lot a lot a lot of blood
and I was so tired
<malay>uzur dah tak datang</malay> the <malay>kelakar</malay> part was the <malay>uzur datang</malay> still <malay>datang</malay>
(uh huh)
(mm) so <malay>bila</malay> part <malay>aku uzur tu</malay> I was like <malay>macam</malay>
feel weird [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I don't I don't feel anything I feel a bit weird [lah]
but then <malay>sekali bila</malay> part <malay>yang</malay> the first blood clot <malay>jatuh tu takde pape</malay> [tau] the second time <malay>malam tu bila</malay> part <malay>aku tengah nak tukar</malay> pad [kan] then I saw one small little <malay>kat dalam</malay>
then then I realised I got miscarriage [ah] then my friend I was asking my nurses friend [ah] then my friend said I think yours will be around five to six weeks
already
already five to six old but how you feel right now <malay>aku cakap</malay> I was very tired [lah] I sleep the whole I mean the whole two days I sleep [sia] during my period
<malay>anak</malay> ya in a way [ah]
because I fuck with two guys [what] at that point of time
one is #sha# one is
so one is #sha# one is #yen# so it's like it's either or
okay either or
is it
but you bought first hand right
<malay>aku punya</malay> hundred seventy [jer] [sia]
it's a very good condition
then got then then my friend was like telling me [lah] actually you are you did had miscarriage
if you saw that little photos means you <malay>dah</malay> miscarriage already
I don't dare I was I
I don't know whether I want to cry or I want to
I want to like I mean shocked
because I didn't know that I was pregnant
and I was in on logistic duty <malay>aku tengah angkat berat lagi</malay> I didn't know that I was having a baby inside inside my tummy
(mmhmm) <malay>aku</malay> went into that very like
[ah]
loving that person right
but in a way <malay>bila aku</malay> realise <malay>apa</malay> [tau] <malay>aku tak boleh salah</malay> [kan] <malay>diri aku sorang</malay> [tau]
it's like you didn't expect it to happen [what]
then
during COVID then <malay>aku</malay> realise [lah] that ya
he
I don't know during COVID I was like <malay>macam</malay>
take it or leave it [eh]
(mm)
my friend say <malay>hijau dengan</malay> black because she got black

(mm)
then <malay>yan</malay>
!alah! <malay>aku dah</malay> delete <malay>gambar dia</malay> [lah]

ya I remember I
I remember giving him this I want pickles a lot a lot of pickles
[ah] [sial] <malay>aku makan benda masam hari tu</malay>
but #yen# was like overreacting to it [ah] which <malay>aku</malay> find it it's
like okay
I say I got miscarriage and then he said that he is <malay>mandul</malay>
that that's when the side start to happen [ah]
he's not
because he doesn't have any sickness
he's is like legitly he's a pure bred he's a A
he's a an S A class [tau]
#sha# maybe <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [eh]

so
mama
so mama you already you know right that <malay>kakak</malay> [kan] <malay>suka makan ayam goreng</malay> right and then lately <malay>kakak macam makan</malay> popeyes <malay>sebab</malay> I think popeyes <malay>punya ayam goreng</malay> is way nicer than what do you think
but I think
popeyes <malay>punya ayam</malay> is more crunchy [eh] I think it's like it's not
I don't know but I think it's more crunchy then it's not that oily compared to and then ya the mashed potato popeye <malay>punya</malay> like <malay>lebih sedap</malay>
and then compared to <malay>punya tak sedap langsung</malay> I mean like it's it's it's nice
one is nice but
(err) the popeyes' one has a lot more things in it compared to is just like mashed potato and the gravy but popeyes is like gravy mashed potato then got like the vegetables and everything
ya
(mm)
[oh] ya you know (err) starbucks right now cause (err) christmas
starbucks right now it's christmas right so
(err) they got the toffee nut
crunch latte and then they got these new other flavours also like really want to try before because that time so many times I want to try never get to try the starbucks one before but ya
(err) but they say it's quite sweet because my friend
allowed me to like taste some of hers then it's was like okay [lah] quite sweet but actually quite nice also
and then they got the one at they sell the packet [one] also
feel like buying it because you know like home
like
I be my own barista at home right because of (err) coronavirus and everything
so ya do you want to try it with me
I want I don't know I want like I want what's that called the turkey with the cranberry sauce
I don't know why but I think because I watch
so many videos of people like preparing christmas
dinners thanksgiving dinners then I'm like I keep on wanting it and also want my
what's that called [ah] gingerbread cookie because
<malay>lagi-lagi</malay> like right now melvados is so nearby right so it's really easy to get the the so-called the gingerbread cookies and all the christmas stuff
and then [oh] christmas cake the log cake everything ya I also want that one
ya
ya that's why
and then
like right now also I think you know I got my performance right then everybody want to celebrate also very hard because
(um) because of the coronavirus the maximum group of five thing and all
which is okay [lah] but at the same time quite sad especially when it's around this time of the year when it's like christmas and then everyone to
everyone want to throw like chalet or like meet up to gather together
but then you still have to wear your mask <malay>macam susah</malay> and then it's also <malay>tak</malay> fun <malay>langsung sebab</malay>
you cannot meet your friend
ya
[oh] ya they got the hundred dollar fees the hundred dollars
tourism voucher right and then like
that one I searched up they say you can use for dining also in certain places then but the problem right now is that a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> complain
<malay>dia susah</malay> to <malay>dapat</malay> the vouchers <malay>sebab ada berapa banyak</malay> website you have to go like you have a lot choices to choose then website <malay>tu</malay> then in the process <malay>semua pun macam</malay> very <malay>sulit</malay> and very complicated so
ya and then you can only redeem it I think <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> first of december
and then starting to starting on monday also got the mask
can take our masks also I don't know if you know
ya
I don't know [eh] I think so like I saw at <malay>kita punya</malay> void deck they put the poster everything then they say (um) start date thirtieth this monday [lah] thirtieth november until like
two weeks later
ya and it's very dirty and like very uncomfortable already cause the metal keep like the metal thing at the nose is like twisted and bent already
haven't yet haven't yet school holidays still got school
ya
like usual [lah]
ya
I also don't know we all don't know yet
[oh] I don't know I see first how cause we also don't know what we want to do with the vouchers cause in case we got any celebration or what
then (uh)
the mask
ya the mask I never put in the washing machine but it because keep on using and then keep on washing then like when you dump in your bag when you take it off or like when you want to eat all these are very hard
very uncomfortable already and very dirty already like you can see the before and after got ya got before is white clean <malay>kemas</malay> and then the after is yellow very dirty then <malay>macam macam asyik lunyai</malay> and everything so ya
the one that I painted all cannot use because the paint smell very strong then if I tried I tried wearing it but then
like he did like that
ya
ya cannot
ya even after washing cannot wear cause it's very (err) smelly and all
ya the paint is not the paint I think and the material also because the paint is acrylic paint it's not fabric paint then the material like I told you it's very thin also so I think that's like those two are like the contributing factors to why the mask <malay>tak boleh dipakai</malay> so ya
but fabric painting the problem is that <malay>dia punya</malay> paint very faint very thin <malay>macam</malay> acrylic <malay>dia</malay> it's very thick right so it's very easy to get the colour everything but fabric paint one is that it's very thin so it's very it's basically water but with (err) like a bit more <malay>macam</malay> like you add flour to it right then you add a bit of food colouring like that then secondly fabric paint like if I buy like waste of money like that because I only use it for the mask and then like I won't buy small bottles also like we need to get good quality fabric paint to last [mah] so that's the problem then it's not like I just want to try then I look at the mask also I feel like wearing so like
very <malay>rugi</malay> because I don't want it to get dirty so ya
so I've been searching up then they all sell like big big bottles [one] but I don't want big bottle I want like small bottle because like if I buy a big bottle there's no point for me because I won't be using it often
and then it like my room already have so many arts supplies so there's no point for me to buy more arts supplies and then put it there and then when I want to clean it up I have to clean everything up again like you saw last time plastic bag <malay>banyak</malay> all my stuff so ya I don't know see how [lor] even if I buy like (um) the big big bottles now I won't buy all colours I just need certain colours but the problem is you know like I love to use a lot of colours for my paintings so ya
ya like that [lor] don't know how see first
I also don't know we see how we have whole month then we have school we also don't know how then ya
no the problem is right now is that we all have like all these extra activities and everything then we because of coronavirus we all don't know like the timetable then the internship preparation everything so it's all over the place and then COVID doesn't help us also like makes it harder for all of us so <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay>
I don't know see how like if I can get into uni then go into uni [lah] if cannot then see how start working first or what
ya like that [lor] see how don't know how already
cause it's also quite hard [what] poly and very different you know go into then with the whole coronavirus also very hard already
tomorrow got my (err) I got school what so then after that I need to rush my assignments
ya
ya if can by monday if not by tuesday because I need to print it out and then submit by thursday morning then on monday also I got another assignment due so that one I need to clean up also
ya
until six seven
ya
no more already but the normal class is until six seven like that
okay
ya
[meh]
no I don't think I can meet you all because I need to finish all my assignments already then <malay>kalau tak habis</malay> then I will be rushing then <malay>susah</malay> if I rush because
I got like my two thousand word assignment essay and then got my (uh) reflection journal that I have to clean up
finish already the reflection journal finish already but then I have to clean it up and then
for the
essay the two thousand word essay I'm only at like nine hundred words so ya
two thousand
ya
ya
but it's actually very easy just the organisation and the
because we have to cite all our work and everything so that one is a problem but but it's actually quite easy [lah] because I got all my articles already
the reflection is about just like (um)
the reflection is all about like emotional intelligence cause of my elective and then like the essays about like kids and then their development and everything so ya
no still have
ya I still have my religious school until next year
no it's not finish end of this year semester ends mid year [what]
ya
I think so [ah] that one also not so sure you have to check with the <malay>ustazah</malay> again
no
ya
ya the water sports sounds fun [ah] but I also don't know because holiday a lot of people but then we got the hundred dollars also I very scared it's very packed so <malay>tak tahu macam mana</malay>
until june two thousand and twenty is <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> the expiration date for the hundred dollar voucher
ya
I also don't know see what have [lah] what you cook or what's in the house
and then just eat whatever there is I think tomorrow will like
I don't think I'll be eating a lot also cause I need to rush my assignment like I maybe just eat lunch then try to finish everything by tomorrow
even tonight later after this I have to
do my assignment I have to find some articles because we have group work and then monday we need to think what to do before class
no school you go to school no but during the break time we meet instead to do the work
ya but like the school website the school library all then we have to find the articles
then after that we have to discuss on what we want to do everything because it's due in two weeks time but my classmate is like the very
(um) chop chop type of person ya you know so <malay>kena</malay> we all <malay>nak buat macam cepat-cepat</malay> because he also wants to do it very fast because his idea is that if we do fast then <malay>dapat rehat cepat</malay> so ya
ya
ya
I think you can ask #adi# if he want to go market with you if he not working because I cannot go I got <malay>madrasah</malay> tomorrow
no [eh] no preference
I think like a lot I think maybe just like your finger food like nuggets or like hotdog <malay>goreng</malay> or like fishball like that
the <malay>epok-epok</malay> also just now (err) <malay>orang sebelah kasih</malay> also like very nice also
I never get to try the sardine I wanted to try the sardine but apparently they make sardine and the potato one
but the <malay>epok-epok</malay> like very oily also like it's very crunchy and very <malay>garing</malay>
but it's also like very oily the moment you eat it you will know they fry instead of what you usually do which is
(um)
bake it
[oh]
I think like the <malay>epok-epok</malay> when I eat it kind of remind me a bit of the potato one reminded me of of like old #chang kee# [one] cause it's like
(err) taste a bit like it but I feel like this one was more filling and was like more satisfying to eat <malay>sebab dia banyak inti</malay> and then <malay>dia pun macam dia pun macam</malay> very crunchy <malay>rangup</malay> like that
the old #chang kee# one is like you know sometimes like it's not crunchy it's just like dough and then like
very oil but this one was like very nice to eat
the doughnut was very sweet like the doughnut was very nice but very sweet I tried the #ondeh-ondeh# and the red velvet one
ya the #ondeh-ondeh# one
but it's like
the #ondeh-ondeh# one was more of like colour it's just that
you can take the #ondeh-ondeh# because the coconut was roasted
other than that it was nothing it was just like green icing with like whipped cream inside the bombom
the coconut was (uh) on top of the bombom just for decoration purposes
but it was like very little but got flavour [lah] and then <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>sedap macam rasa macam</malay> those #ondeh-ondeh# cake but the problem was that
altogether it's very sweet and then maybe because I ate the red velvet before that then <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>manis</malay> and everything then I cannot <malay>tahan</malay> also
ya
the <malay>apam</malay> I ate and
I eat one and I think there's one more right now in the kitchen
[oh] then I don't know cause the <malay>apam</malay> was actually supposed to be one for me and one for <malay>adik</malay> but I think I know I ate it but I don't know if <malay>adik</malay> ate it cause he was very full very full after eating the #bhatoora#
I thought there's like a brown the brown plastic
on the kitchen stove I thought that was the <malay>apam</malay>
ya I mean ya I also don't know
ya but then the potato from just now morning still have inside the fridge so like
if you want eat the #briyani# with the potato also can
and then the the <malay>kuah</malay> from the #bhatoora# also still have
in the kitchen so ya
ya but the #bhatoora# like in the morning eat very nice [ah] but also like really oily
I think they like I ya they deep fried or something
but then the chickpea also very oily like when you want to <malay>tuang</malay> it's on the #bhatoora#
the oil all come out first then the chickpeas but I don't know but the chickpeas also very nice cause it's like spicy a bit like
[ah] got sour sour taste a bit
ya that one but I think
and you know when I was eating the chickpeas I thought like [oh] maybe can make hummus then we eat with we brought hummus then we eat with like the tortilla bread or something also very nice
maybe cause your chickpeas from india or something not the singapore chickpeas or malaysian ones that's why the chickpeas very big
very juicy also got like very nice taste
we can make like hummus we can make like that time we made a lot right but we can make we can separate into three containers we made the normal one then we make a bit more spicy and then another one like a different flavour or something
so like ya then we can buy like those you know those like tortilla chips or something also eat with the hummus instead of pita bread I think very nice also
ya that's why I was saying [ah] so we divide into three portions then each portion is that each portion is a different flavour
I think I don't know maybe you
wednesday or friday can see first (uh)
and then I don't know why but like when we were talking just now you talked about
doing hummus right <malay>tiba-tiba ingat macam minum teh turki makan</malay> hummus
<malay>macam sedap</malay> [seh]
but turkish tea very hard to make cause they have their own set of tea leaves and they have their own ways of doing it
I so shocked cause I really wanted to drink
cause it's like very nice very sweet very floral but apparently it's very hard to make
[oh] ya #baklava# also very nice #baklava# with like <malay>teh</malay> O <malay>sedap</malay> [seh]
#kunafe# is which one
(mm) I don't think I tried #kunafe# before but I think I've heard about it before
the is something like very pastry and then like it's
they it's just like pastry and then got a bit of nuts on top everything then you got like syrup like that then you pour over
I think
I don't know see first (uh) I think like
[ah] cannot commit to anything right now cause don't know the timetable everything then we also one of our modules also we have to meet with the senior and then we we planned on going out but we don't know when cause right now also the senior not feeling that well
I don't know I I actually want to eat like something like fish and co manhattan or like what's that called the shellout like that also very nice
ya
[oh] ya that
the the charcoal waffle with the earl grey syrup and the dark chocolate ice cream that one was very nice
but I very scared if we go back then later like we have all these expectations then <malay>bila dah nak makan</malay> then <malay>macam rasa dia berbeza</malay> cause <malay>orang lain yang buat</malay>
so ya <malay>macam tak tahu</malay> [ah] like
hopefully if we go back which is all the way at #joo chiat# right like (err) that that place
hopefully like it will taste the same
!huh! #ang mo kio# A&W halal
wait then the jewel one also halal already is it
I thought they say got A&W [oh] no that one is shake shack
[oh] I want the shortcake very nice but the thing is the cream they do it like they spread the cream <malay>macam tak</malay>
ya the whipped cream it's like <malay>macam</malay> it's not like <malay>serasi</malay> in that not not not <malay>serasi</malay> it's like <malay>tak</malay> equal like that <malay>bila dia</malay> spread if you see but the strawberries everything very fresh also
ya the strawberry shortcake was small but the thing is it's small but very filling and then the strawberries also like on top a lot and then like in between the cake the sponge cage there's also a lot of strawberries and then it's all very fresh not the like freeze dried strawberry type
I think the #satay# when you eat it really warm and it was very nice because it's like got the charcoal taste and then got the <malay>lemak</malay> and then you know the #satay# <malay>punya minyak</malay> [ah] like that right and then you eat with the <malay>lontong</malay> the <malay>bawang timun</malay> everything then you <malay>cecah</malay> in the <malay>kuah</malay> very <malay>sedap</malay> and then <malay>macam</malay>
ya the <malay>babat</malay> I thought the <malay>babat</malay> #satay# I wouldn't like but when I ate it <malay>bila masih panas</malay> [kan] <malay>sedap gila</malay> then <malay>macam tapi bila dah sejuk tu macam susah nak makan</malay>
I think the I don't know for me was the <malay>nasi</malay> was nothing special it was like <malay>nasi minyak</malay> like that
and then like the I think like overall it was really nice [ah] but the they have the like the <malay>sambal</malay> not the <malay>sambal</malay> but like the chilli
chilli oil like that right I expected it to be spicy but not spicy then you eat the green chilli <malay>makan dengan</malay> green chilli <malay>gitu</malay> with the <malay>nasi macam tak pedas setakat macam</malay> crunchy crunchy <malay>gitu</malay>
but the <malay>daging</malay> very nice <malay>macam makan gitu macam sendiri</malay> because it's very easily peel off then <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>sedap</malay>
and then <malay>macam</malay> the <malay>minyak</malay> right I was thinking if like if <malay>kalau kat rumah sendiri</malay> right the <malay>nasi</malay> you put in the <malay>minyak</malay> then you <malay>panaskan</malay> you <malay>buang</malay> you <malay>buat macam nasi goreng</malay> like that
ya but I think I like it [ah] cause
I I was like in the mood for like just not
not a lot of flavour but like just the <malay>daging</malay> taste with a bit of salt and like chilli like raw chilli <malay>makan tepi gitu</malay>
but the sad thing is the vegetables <malay>dia orang tak kasih banyak sikit</malay> [jer] the lettuce and everything ya
<malay>sebab</malay> if I have a lot then <malay>macam makan pun macam tak segan</malay> right then can put and wrap everything nicely
ya
ya
I've been wanting to eat that also like I think maybe buy seaweed and then <malay>nasi</malay> then we still have a bit of the <malay>serunding</malay> right
and (uh)
ya I saw then I was like thinking maybe I don't I don't think seaweed and <malay>serunding</malay> will taste nice so I think <malay>macam beli</malay> lettuce <malay>atau</malay> cabbage <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] <malay>serunding</malay> and then <malay>buat macam</malay> wrap wrap <malay>gitu</malay> then <malay>sambal belacan</malay> and then a bit of <malay>macam daging ke apa dah tu bawang putih bawang bawang besar gitu letak letak</malay>
<malay>kat dalam makan</malay>
but chicken on christmas like
japanese cheaper you know japanese people
ya japanese people you know (err) during christmas they don't eat turkey or what you know they go for you know even their right the each chicken bucket right they have a christmas special you know
no [eh] I don't think so then we also want to do like me and my friends we also very broke already so <malay>nak beli barang tu semua</malay> but maybe we all like
<malay>keluar keluar</malay> to cause <malay>hari ni</malay> is
(uh) naomi's birthday and then like we all thought <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>kita pun terlupa</malay> then it's like [oh] then we just okay [lah] december we can go out because by then everyone should be free because right now it's exam period for a lot of people
so
ya
ya during december then (err) I also meeting like some of my (err) like
(err) #kailey# and #ayumi# the couple that I tell you about right then I am meeting them so like <malay>macam</malay>
to cause like <malay>dah lama nak jumpa tapi kita punya</malay> timetable <malay>semua</malay> very busy right so <malay>nak jumpa</malay> and then <malay>macam makan sama-sama</malay> or something then that time I told you me and #ayumi# we eat this very nice ice cream at paragon right <malay>dia belanja</malay> because she got the voucher then we thought of like maybe we go eat the ice cream or what [ah] see how
I want (uh) we cannot go cause the person not feeling well but ya then see how [lah] because we waiting for another week to see if she okay or not then if we can go we can go if cannot then we need to find another person to go to then I cannot talk a lot about it also like even with you because it's like
personal private thing
but we all my group all very stressed [ah] because like we all thought like (err) we all planned already and then like that night last minute (uh) that night last minute got that text that cannot go and we already missed out on two sessions then we have to a certain activity with her [mah] but don't know how [lah] see how
no we waited for her to see how if you okay or not then if you are okay then we continue if not need find another person cause we skipped two sessions already and then if this week she cannot then three sessions skipped <malay>kena</malay> find <malay>orang baru</malay> [ah] don't know how see first
I think you should order the strawberry shortcake because first is halal secondly the strawberry shortcake there I think it's like
bet the person bought <malay>lebih sedap daripada</malay> you <malay>beli</malay> because like really like the strawberries and everything are really fresh and then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak was-was</malay> also <malay>nak makan</malay>
so ya then <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>beli besar pun</malay> like knowing you you know like you <malay>makan</malay> one slice then you can <malay>simpan</malay> if not you just buy the five hundred grams keep some for yourself like that
ya but the thing is right that cake everyone was forcing to finish it also cause everybody was like and ya and then cause the cake was whipped cream it's not chocolate or what it's like whipped cream then we also had that apple strudel [oh] the apple strudel was so nice
strudel strudel shop still have but not at #jurong# point anymore I only eat the
chocolate one the chocolate one very nice very like <malay>lemak manis</malay> everything I never try the mango one but I tried like a bit [lah] because I also cleaning up right then I tried a bit but not bad also but the chocolate one !wah! very nice I <malay>rugi</malay> they never buy the apple flavour
she she also a bit hard right now because like she also on like diet and everything then she not eating a lot of things also or she like controlling herself
if not then go eat at <malay>hajjah maimunah</malay> or something <malay>sana</malay> [kan] <malay>sedap</malay> and then like
you guys can eat #bingsu# or like eat at the cafe like the ice-cream waffle I can tell you the place that I eat ice-cream waffle with my friend because that one also not bad
it's <malay>besar</malay> so <malay>dua orang makan kenyang</malay>
ya and then the environment also very cosy for both of you to talk to one another
if she eat the turkish food you can bring her to that restaurant that day if she eat [lah] but I doubt so she will eat because the
turkish food is either very oily or very sweet then she doesn't like both things [what]
buy for her exercise pants
buy for her exercise pants and sports bra
if not if not just go out with her go to a cafe and then like <malay>belanja</malay> her drinks or that one because she usually drink coffee like flat white she doesn't drink like sweet drinks anymore
and she is nowadays more of a coffee person
dessert also that time went out with her she doesn't eat a lot like she only eat one or two bites then she expected me to finish but then both of us cannot finish when we ate the ice cream waffle because it was very it was very nice but we were very full after our lunch
if not then like go to
like maybe if not just go to a cafe and then buy finger food like
fries or something like that we saw and then like
buy like one or two finger food and then dessert and then like a drink and then that's all
if not just go for dessert or like tea break like that something like that
ya
then not worth it [seh]
if not
if not go dessert tea break or you can go like those if you really want like <malay>macam</malay> treat her very nicely then you can go to those restaurants or
got few restaurants offer tea break
but like eat cake and
<malay>minum teh</malay> like that or like TWG got like the two set the two people set
ya so you <malay>boleh makan kat situ macam</malay> tea break I don't know if you remember but they got this tea break thing where <malay>macam dia orang makan</malay> [ah] you pay for two people and then you can eat all the treats you want and the tea you can choose from TWG
then
that time also
(uh) my friends they they went on a date right then she shared with me they also did the (uh) tea break thing and then they also eat she say very nice cause it's a lot of floral fruity fruity tea then the tea also <malay>dia minum macam sedap</malay>
then she say it's actually quite affordable so it's expensive [lah] but in terms of like the quality and the atmosphere she say was very nice if <malay>betul-betul nak lepak-lepak makan-makan</malay> catch up with one another
no that one is
another one I don't really remember but I can ask her
cause like the one that I do my painting right the one that I said like <malay>buka</malay> the community painting that one they also offer
like tea break session but I think <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> it's
about
either
plus minus ten dollars from hundred dollar so I think like hundred thin or below hundred
but it's also very nice because the
the desserts all like really nicely <malay>macam betul-betul sedap-sedap</malay> they got assortments <malay>macam</malay> like small little kids everything then the tea the atmosphere at the place is also very comfortable
certain places only like I searched up only certain hotels they will accept the voucher and then only certain timings and all so you have to really search up on how to use right cause right now a lot of people complain <malay>macam susah nak pakai</malay> voucher <malay>ni sebab</malay> you <malay>tak tahu</malay> really <malay>macam mana nak pakai</malay> you <malay>tak tahu</malay> hotel <malay>mana</malay> accept hotel <malay>mana tak</malay>
but ya like that one also I wanted to tell you certain hotels they will accept the hundred dollar voucher
ya so from what I remember is that you cannot join the voucher you can only use it like one person one person but you can meet in the same place you cannot use it together
or you can like use hundred dollars but you can pay for four people [lah] but you cannot like (err) four hundred dollars
ya
I think
(err) if not you can go #bugis# like the #bugis# #haji# area that one confirm got a lot
very nice one if you the lavender area the lavender to #bugis# street there right that one that time I went out with my friends a lot of cafe and it's (err) like it's like affordable (uh) not bad quality also really nice atmosphere also really nice if not
like the one that my friends told me at somerset ion there that that area around there got a lot a few cafes also which is below hundred dollars you can go for
and then
(err) ya and then if not you can go to the that time the #joo chiat#
#changi# area
the ya then <malay>macam</malay> got a few cafes [lah] if not also the
around her area
#choa chu kang# area like that or like
further about there got a lot of really nice cafes also but you need to know how to walk around there because it's quite #ulu# [mah] so ya
ya
that time I went with her at #jurong# east the coffeesmith
we ate also not bad but the price like (uh) the like I bought a medium she bought for me a medium matcha
in fact
not bad [lah] but like not worth it also so it's better if you want
like really get quality and atmosphere wise right it's better for you to just go to like #bugis# or something to <malay>lepak</malay> and <malay>berbual-berbual kat situ</malay> because atmosphere <malay>pun</malay> #shiok# and then <malay>makanan pun</malay> actually really not bad and then nowadays #bugis# area I think got a lot few more cafes and then
that time I <malay>makan</malay> burger with my friend right then I told you that the atmosphere also not bad
ya that one if you want also can eat burger that cause they have like a meal
I want eat the I don't know I want to eat like
christmas log cake not really log cake but I just want the atmosphere back the christmas atmosphere cause party all cannot happen already
ya so only five people like that but ya and then like we want do house party
I think five like I know in school it's still five people
but
to be honest there's no difference whether five to eight people it's still like you still cannot find a seat where you can sit together
because usually almost all the seats are like five five people
[oh] ya cannot refund right
<malay>tapi</malay> if like that <malay>macam susah</malay> because from the look of it <malay>susah nak</malay> travel <malay>sebab pasal</malay> COVID and then I read up they said that <malay>kalau nak</malay> travel <malay>pun sekarang dah ada banyak</malay> measurements like they open borders but you have to go through a lot of things for you to be able to travel overseas
ya the stay home notice right so <malay>macam susah</malay> like waste of time
but I don't know then the fact that they don't refund the airplane tickets but will only bring to next year but <malay>sekarang pun macam</malay> end of year <malay>pun belum lagi</malay> okay everything <malay>macam</malay> we are still <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> in phase two
so <malay>macam</malay> I don't know [ah] quite <malay>susah</malay>
is it the ticket we can go anywhere or certain locations
!huh! if can why not we go europe with their plane ticket
we go #bali#
indonesia
I want eat I want to eat the I really want to eat the indonesian <malay>bakso sedap</malay> [seh] <malay>dengan macam</malay> chilli <malay>sendiri dengan kicap dia gitu kat tepi-tepi</malay> roadside <malay>makan-makan gitu</malay>
<malay>dengan dia orang punya soda gembira</malay> everything and then the atmosphere <malay>orang-orang rokok</malay> everything
I want the <malay>murtabak manis</malay>
[oh] ya this whole year <malay>takde pasar malam</malay> [seh]
I don't think will have
luckily my school has some of the <malay>pasar malam</malay> food like #takoyaki# all and then like cantine all have the <malay>goreng pisang goreng keledek</malay> all so okay [lah] can still <malay>tahan</malay> but the #you zha kueh# burger ramly all !wah! I really miss <malay>keropok lekor</malay>

[oh] right ya ya I invite I mean in the first place also you never watch
so I did not invite you
right
no [lah]
you still hype <malay>dia masih ada</malay> serious serious because right now (um) the movie just came out <malay>abeh macam</malay>
all all of us (uh) <malay>kita pergi tengok</malay> movie <malay>dia</malay> [kan]
there are some of our friends also <malay>dorang masih belum tengok</malay>
but they still do watch the anime [ah]
and also <malay>tak salah aku</malay> the season two <malay>pun belum keluar kalau kau belum</malay>
[ah] <malay>kau baru nak</malay> start the hype you still [ah] don't have to wait so long for the season two
but
but don't I don't know I I feel like you should wait for season two come out <malay>sebab tadi aku baru dapat tahu</malay> season two possibly <malay>dorang akan keluar</malay> like
(err) cause season one it came out like april twenty nineteen
(uh) september twenty nineteen
ya Netflix it came out [ah] slow but it came out came out right april <malay>tak salah</malay> april twenty twenty that's when the hype <malay>betul-betul naik</malay> [ah] [sia] and <malay>apa</malay> everytime
like (uh) there's some <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] I read cause I think it release per episode or maybe the whole thing at once but because of that [ah] the popularity really skyrocketed man and and also (err) <malay>dia nya</malay> #manga# because normally #mangas# like <malay>macam</malay> for example you know the big three of anime the one piece bleach (uh) #naruto#
<malay>dorang punya</malay> like the amount of copies that they [kan]
is more than hundred million copies
and they took
<malay>berapa lama</malay> [eh] <malay>tak salah aku</malay> one piece is nineteen ninety seven out like okay [lah] this is just a rough gauge all of them [ah] took like at least ten years plus to reach at least hundred million copies
<malay>untuk</malay> demon slayer for the #manga# <malay>aje</malay> [eh]
<malay>dia</malay> !wah! it's only four years [ah]
<malay>dah</malay> hundred and twenty million <malay>dah</malay>
[orh] ya
exactly
[oh]
[ah]
[oh]
[ah] at the sorry [ah] at the mountain right
[oh] ya
!wah!
so
does that mean [ah] in the future will be a demand also
with drums [ah] [ah] <malay>tapi pasal</malay> [kan] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] japanese [kan] <malay>kita melayu kita kita kompang</malay>
<malay>masuk masuk rumah kau selamat hari raya</malay> [eh] <malay>asal bilik-bilik semua tukar-tukar</malay> [eh]
[oh] ya
[orh] ya that [one] is a lumen six
and
the fact that there is only lumen six [eh] !wah! he's really strong
ya
such coward
!wah!
man
even
even though he doesn't speak much but
ya the like what they say [ah] <malay>apa</malay> actions speak louder than words
that is exactly how <malay>apa</malay> #gui# is [ah] as a person
but but
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>dia nya</malay> other than the anime
(um) <malay>apa</malay> soundtrack <malay>dia</malay> [kan]
it really blews me away [ah] blows me away sorry
because one thing about (uh) anything in general [ah] <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> a show or something [kan]
it is more emotional <malay>kalau dia nya</malay> soundtrack is a very <malay>macam</malay> it's a good it's a good soundtrack it can relate to you like how demon slayer <malay>sekarang</malay> the one thing people can relate to at first is the song
the by sung by lisa <malay>yang</malay> the opening
[ah] opening [ah]
(mm)
(mm) ya
ya
it's like (err) one thing good about anime is like there's no
[ah] pure evil or pure good cause normally those pure evil inside the anime turns out that
they were corrupted in the first place because of certain events in their life
and <malay>pasal</malay>
(um)
like those people like they they've seen too much hatred until it becomes something that they're used to
that it becomes like everyday object everyday [ah] actions are <malay>sampai</malay> they don't know [ah] they can't determine what is right or wrong anymore but !wah! it's
mind blowing [ah] legit
ya
ya
ya
(um)
(mm) ya
(uh) one piece
ya
[oh] ya
not too much
it's it's (uh) it's not like those dramas like one episode is like one hour
[orh] ya
ya it has been I I mean I don't know if it's the usual but
for all the #animes# [ah] I watch <malay>semua ikut yang</malay> this <malay>dua puluh minit dua puluh minit dua puluh minit tapi ada yang</malay>
<malay>macam aku rasa</malay> like one shot there's this thing called one shot #animes# <malay>dorang</malay> usually <malay>macam</malay> forty plus minutes <malay>abeh dah tu</malay> [jer]
<malay>dia macam</malay> a short a short film [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay> but it the sometimes like
<malay>orang fikir</malay> like [oh] the longer the anime is the better it will be but some people might not know actually the the quality of how you
tell a story in in a in a film is what matters [ah] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> even like those thirty or ten minute films [kan] it leaves a very
(uh) everlasting mark in your in your memory <malay>macam tak boleh lupakan</malay> it's that good [ah] like the story storytelling even (uh) the soundtrack cause come on man [ah] without soundtrack anything will be boring [lah]
exactly cause that's why I I always [ah]
I always envy those people who can like make great soundtracks for [ah] films or anime to make it bring to life especially with all the great animation or like the great actors in in in shows or something but I know it will take a while for me to get up to that standard the the level
[ah] ya
[ah] ya
ya correct
no no no no no
if it's bachelor of science I think I'll fail a lot of modules already
[oh] ya man
luckily that is like
one prerequisite of maths I have to take [oh] wait no other than that got physics [lah] but that's all [lah] physics should be simpler because this [one]
its pre-calculus [sia] what the heck is that it's like A maths which I never learn before in secondary school
ya
[oh] is it the
the position vector [eh]
!wow!
it's okay man it's okay <malay>aku nya</malay> A math <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>bila entah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> there's this kind of stigma [ah] whenever you go to school or like university [ah] in that case
you will understand that there are many more things that you don't know
so whenever you go to university you have that certain feeling that <malay>macam kau rasa kau rasa bodoh</malay>
[ah] I I shared this with my one of my friends [ah] <malay>dia pun tengah ambil</malay> university but I think is like I think ya so ya [ah] bro that [one] is just that's just one person [lah] don't don't let it bring bad image to the school man
ya so (err) ya that's why exactly but okay [lah] the one thing that we can generalise is like whenever you go to university you feel stupid at first you might feel stupid afterwards but the process makes you feel less stupid
especially when you (err) encounter like many problem solving [ah] methods or like
especially <malay>kalau kau buat</malay> coding <malay>atau</malay> math [kan] there's definitely
tend to be like some parts where <malay>macam</malay> [oh] wait what's going on I don't understand [sia] and then you have to seek for help from other people it's not it's not the same as like poly <malay>atau atau</malay> secondary school [tau]
independent
yes exactly ya
it's quite hard
it's quite hard for me [ah] because one thing (um)
I'm a I'm an introvert so I don't really mingle much with (um) other people or like
(uh) actively seek out for help or talk to other people so it's kind of hard on my case it really force me to you know step out of my comfort comfort zone talk to other people and
I don't know why maybe it's because my ego like
I know I have to try it out first to [ah] do it whether I don't don't know or know then after that seek for help because sometimes I feel like
like (mm) I don't want to tell people that I cannot do this
that mindset is the one that holds me back a lot everytime want to seek for help
ya
ya ya
(mm)
ya
<malay>sebab mak aku</malay> english teacher
(uh) ya ya
(mm)
that sounds
crystallisation thinking [eh]
!wow!
(mm)
(mm)
ya and also <malay>macam</malay> being an introvert you you have this certain set of skill it's called (err) from what I learn in psychology like different people have different
(uh) soft skills that they're born with
like (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> there's this thing called intrapersonal skill that's it that is !huh!
ya
ya there's interpersonal skill and intrapersonal skill intrapersonal if I'm not wrong is skill [lah] but the the term for intrapersonal is like you observe
(uh) your surroundings like you can read the feelings of the room like the people around you and you understand that the the mood [lah] in in a way
ya ya ya
it's for for interpersonal it's slightly different this more to like you think of your own (uh) thoughts you try to make sure you're careful on what you say because you [ah] in a way it's like you think a lot about what you want to say or like in your own thoughts your thought process everything
(uh) you you just you don't want to bring up the (uh) negative (uh) vibe when you speak up
so this the intrapersonal skill is for people whom I guess are introverts [lah] so they tend to be more aware of other people like
how to say it might be a a different way of saying like you judge people
but you are more conserved
you are more conservative
[ah] ya
(mm) ya
<malay>macam apa</malay> [sia] <malay>dia ni</malay> like <malay>asal asal</malay> [ah] <malay>kecil hati</malay> exactly and like some people might not know like whatever they do right if people don't give them feedback like [eh] don't don't be so abrupt don't be so <malay>macam</malay> rude [ah] <malay>kalau dorang tak ada orang cakap gini</malay> [kan] the person who speak all those abrupt words or <malay>macam kasar</malay> [kan] <malay>dia tak akan rasa apa-apa dia fikir macam</malay> [oh] <malay>ni semua</malay> [ah] normal [lah] <malay>takde orang cakap apa-apa [pe]</malay> so I'll just continue with what I'm doing [ah]
(mm)
[ah] ya ya ya ya ya
(mm)
ya and and in okay [ah] in university especially
adapting and also <malay>apa</malay> [eh] what's that word again (uh) you have to manage your time ya time management is the utmost priority in a university life
okay
cannot
!huh!
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
drop
(mm)
ya
[orh]
[oh] !wow!
!wow!
it's (uh) it's the same thing for my my school also cause (err) if I'm not wrong [ah] is (err) when you said academic warning right ya at that time also I think it is certain in all university [lah] if you never meet their requirement after like every semester or something
but (uh) if I'm not wrong for my case cause yours is part time and I'm full time (um) if you are if you have a academic warning already
<malay>abeh kalau</malay> your
<malay>dah macam</malay>
lesser than two point eight
then <malay>kau akan dapat</malay> suspension
suspension meaning
<malay>satu tahun kau</malay>
[ah] <malay>kau</malay> [ah] [eh] sorry
after one year then <malay>kau kena</malay> re-enroll
ya
(um) when you are in a academic warning <malay>punya ni</malay> [ah] ya
if you haven't get academic warning then <malay>asalkan</malay> your is not lesser than two point O or maybe one point eight then you're still save [lah]
[ah] ya ya better
if not in the future you must study harder and much much harder just to get that to increase by a bit
ya
[ah]
(mm)
[ah]
some
ya some some still have exams like math we still have exam [ah]
but your course don't have math right
subject verb agreement
[oh] [eh]
!wah!
[orh] okay I
<malay>ada</malay> is that <malay>macam kau nya</malay> topic <malay>bukan</malay> topic <malay>apa</malay> module module is that module <malay>macam</malay>
(uh)
<malay>kau nak kena belajar pasal</malay> another language
like <malay>macam</malay> malay <malay>atau</malay> mandarin
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[orh] is it the same as <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau nak berbual melayu</malay>
<malay>ada benda kita nak kena</malay> reverse the structure of a of a word
!huh!
[oh]
ya
<malay>macam nak cakap</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> english post office <malay>abeh melayu pejabat</malay> post <malay>dia dia dia macam</malay> reverse [ah] it's in that that way [ah] like <malay>buat orang macam</malay> confusing
but is it mean the same thing
prof [oh] professor
french
[orh] is it
<malay>pejabat</malay> post
[oh] like <malay>apa</malay> dialects [ah] slang slang
(mm)
[oh] I
[ah]
(mm)
(um) is the same for certain schools also like my
my course also I mean initially it's called bachelor of arts in (uh) game design right but I think the the first the freshman batch this year
it is (uh) user experience in game design so what I get from that
is actually what you have been experience [ah] since primary school secondary school like right now
the syllabus is ever changing
so that's why there are certain things that we have to keep up to date
because of that they also update the name of the course to fit in with all the <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>baru-baru punya</malay> module <malay>yang apa nak nak kena ajar</malay> like <malay>aku rasa</malay> for example like
(uh) in the market I guess one thing <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>macam banyak-banyak tukar</malay> is the job finding
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say (err) user experience [kan]
normally <malay>macam tak banyak kerja pasal</malay> user experience [mah] because it's not that known to be (uh) to be like a proper job <malay>orang fikir macam</malay> !alah! <malay>ni orang lain buat boleh buat</malay> [pe] <malay>macam</malay> it's another job
on top of the job that <malay>orang tengah buat</malay> but now it's a good thing that they realise user experience is the most important thing in anything in games in apps in like even in everyday object <malay>macam kau pegang cawan</malay>
the user experience is for you to hold the cup right <malay>abeh kau imagine kalau</malay> they handle <malay>ada duri</malay> <malay>tak</malay> comfortable and that's the user experience it's a ergonomics (err) the the design of the cup that makes your experience in holding the cup
even though <malay>macam</malay> it sounds so simple but it actually helps to make it feel good
<malay>macam kau tengah</malay> bad mood <malay>abeh kau pegang cawan abeh duri kau kau tak rasa</malay>
[ah] [kan] so in a way all these little things help to improve your mood even by a slight chance that it may increase your mood but overall is all this (uh) tiny tiny things that actually make us feel better like what they say (um) enjoyed the little happiness in life
because if you [ah] if you just enjoyed something that is so hard to achieve
like (err) happiness like for example <malay>kau nak dapat macam aku nak kerja</malay>
<malay>dekat tempat kerja ni yang gaji dia bagi tujuh ribu abeh kau sekarang tengah kerja kat tempat kerja ni yang bagi kau seribu lapan ratus</malay>
<malay>abeh kau rasa macam</malay> [eh] how am I gonna get to that level so <malay>kau kau</malay> (uh) <malay>bertungkus-lumus kau</malay> (uh) <malay>cari-cari kerja banyak banyak banyak</malay> and that process <malay>buat kau</malay> bad mood
but you never enjoyed the little happiness in life
[ah]
ya
[ah]
it all comes down to your mindset in what you think brings you happiness [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
some people <malay>dorang dah</malay> so into earning money
that their greed is imposed onto them to make more money <malay>walaupun dorang banyak duit tapi dorang masih nak lebih</malay>
ya they are tuned to that mind mindset <malay>macam</malay> [oh] since I have this much money and it gives me a lot of happiness because it can allow me to buy the things that I have wanted since I was a kid
that means if I have more money that will buy me more things that can make me happy but in the end it's actually brainwashing them that those things are not what they need
to make them happy
it's just something that they feel like they lust for it just because
it (uh)
they imagine them like [eh] with this
I I'll look good [ah] like [ah] with a car like Porsche ya you are satisfied but for how long
(mm)
ya
exactly
but I guess (um)
there's no certain way of like finding happiness like some people because of the happiness that they are trying to achieve that is so far away it allows them to
push boundaries like for example
(um) elon musk [eh] he's a good example because one thing his happiness or his like the end goal for him
is to be buried on mars and that to him is like his true happiness but the process of going there is so extensively or it's so excruciating and
you have to
you have to be like one of the the the top most like the the better humans on earth to actually go beyond what humans can [ah] achieve
like <malay>kau</malay> imagine [ah] like he said in two years [eh]
four years time like humans will be flying to mars like who
[ah] if if you tell me ya if you tell me this when I was (err) I okay [lah] when I was kid you tell me this I'll be damn happy [lah] of course but for people with you know they lived through like
generations of like
[ah] their life like twenty thirty years they have to like go through
especially in our previous generation I think it's like our gen Y
ya
[oh] [ah] sorry millennial millennial so the millennials
our usual mindset is like work hard
play hard then if you work hard definitely all the
<malay>cam rezeki akan di diberikan</malay> like don't focus always on the <malay>rezeki</malay> focus on like
what make things work in in the last time [ah] <malay>macam</malay> retrospect [ah] but for now it's more like
(uh) we focus on little happiness but also
the there's always a yin and yang if you focus on little happiness you can't always get big bigger things
but for those people who focus on the big happiness they might not appreciate the little things
I guess that's how human works
which is why I appreciate like all those people <malay>yang</malay> even though it's just [ah] comic books or like anime [kan] it brings certain joy to you like you feel you feel
like even though this does not improve humanity in a large way but it does give you some things to actually look forward to [lah]
[ah] [ah] ya roller coaster
(mm) ya you have to take a break [ah]
that's why I feel
[ah] for this anime <malay>macam</malay> all these [one]
(uh)
even though it doesn't give much but actually it also in their in their own sense they are also improving
like they impose many real life things into their anime to make it to make you feel more relevant to it
that's why like [ah] <malay>apa</malay> [eh] ya <malay>macam</malay> demon slayer like the like what you said the experience then it's the user experience [lah] the soundtrack visual effects graphics and the characters storyline all that takes into account of the whole topic of user experience
which is why I also like how (um) okay [lah] not demon slayer something much more large scale which is Marvel
!wow!
Marvel is (uh) huge scale of
all the things that you [ah]
you imagine it to happen
it's happening in in that <malay>macam</malay> [ah] alternate universe [lah] in a way [ah] ya Marvel cinematic universe
so what I like about Marvel is <malay>dorang</malay> they <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>dorang suka letak macam orang-orang biasa dalam</malay> the movie <malay>walaupun</malay> that movie <malay>ada banyak orang macam</malay> superpower [kan] <malay>tapi dorang buatkan</malay> character <malay>tu macam</malay> he goes through everyday life as per normal but (uh) they somehow <malay>macam</malay> in a turn of events they stumble upon something which made them into a superhero of some sort even though <malay>ada orang dorang tak ada</malay> [ah] superpower <malay>tapi</malay> a certain grudge or a certain bond towards something <malay>yang buatkan kau macam</malay> strongly
you feel strongly towards that thing
and then it somehow made you into a so called superhero [ah] but with no actual superpower
(uh huh) game of thrones [oh] <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
[orh] ya
cool
[orh]
[ah]
(mm)
ya
the black widow and iron man started
(mm)
[oh] ya
gauntlet
ya
(um) assassin
ya
ya it comes down with
the stronger your drive to work toward something the more things you can achieve and sometimes also like the things you achieve right you might not even notice that it's a huge achievement until people
tell you about it like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam orang gemuk</malay> like they want to achieve being slim like have that [ah] that the beach body
and because of that people like the the process is long but people who rarely meet you when they meet you after like a few months something like that then they will say like [eh] <malay>dah kurus</malay> [eh] [sia] <malay>baik [pe]</malay> but actually <malay>kau kau tak tahu</malay> like the process itself <malay>buatkan kau nak</malay> slim <malay>kau belum habis tapi pasal orang cakap macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau dah kurus</malay> [kan]
you'll feel good [lah]
ya it motivates you even though it's not it's not the like you haven't reach your optimal (uh) weight your optimal image <malay>tapi</malay> the
the thought of people <malay>macam dorang perasan</malay> like <malay>kau tengah berubah</malay> at least <malay>macam</malay> you looking more slim or looking more [ah] toned your body looks so toned then <malay>kau</malay> you'll feel better and it helps to
make your drive even
(uh)
higher
<malay>tapi</malay> it's it's I guess this little happiness <malay>macam kalau nak</malay> go back to what I said earlier like the little happiness <malay>buat kau macam</malay> maintain your course cause <malay>ada orang</malay> let's say <malay>pasal yang</malay> language [one] <malay>aku pun tengah</malay> another language is called C sharp programming language
so that [one] (err) I'm not a tech savvy kind of person not not saying tech savvy it's like I'm not a person who is
(uh) good in you know programming in in in that case but because of this course
I have to force myself to learn because that's part of the like requirements [ah] but in that case also like if you were to think about it [ah]
for this different generations like <malay>sejak</malay> okay [ah] this past few hundred years [ah] there has been certain developments in (uh) certain parts of (uh) humanity like last time there's (uh) agriculture industrial evolution [kan] then there's (uh)
now [eh] ya industrial revolution is what we went through first or is it second then now is a digital evolution
so this digital evolution it requires you to have some knowledge so I thought okay [lah] maybe
I learned this programming it might be useful or it might be very useful for me in the future if <malay>aku tengah cari kerja ke atau kalau macam</malay>
<malay>aku nak</malay> keep up to date to certain things <malay>jadi macam</malay> I'm not
(uh) losing in the race for finding jobs <malay>atau</malay> (uh) skill sets so
<malay>aku</malay> push myself [ah] I push myself to learn the programming but sometimes <malay>kalau kau buat benda sorang</malay> like what I said being an introvert is not a good thing if you want to seek for help
so I
ya and also because you know that if you reach out to people you know it's gonna make [ah] it's gonna help you to actually learn the language because some people they know better than you so that process is the one that is the most
(uh) it's it's hard [ah] is the most hardest thing for me
[orh]
I always I I try push myself with with that mindset because I keep on hearing like
a lot of there are more people that are saying like [ah] if I was younger I would have taken a programming course if I would've known that this will be very relevant like ten years time or like now so
with that in mind it makes me motivated at least to maintain my course I there lot of times that I I feel like dropping out but because of certain people like they helped to push you through
like together cause you know they are also going through the same thing they might not be [ah] okay they might be savvy in programming but they are also not good in certain areas where you can help you know it's like a
I help you help me kind of situations but for those case sometimes people
[ah] [ah] too introvert that they they don't want to show their weaknesses [lah] there are certain people in in my course who are like that but I don't want to say any names but of course
(mm) can say [lah]
ya ya
especially if you okay [lah] probably <malay>yang buatkan kau malu</malay> is <malay>kalau macam kau buat buat buat abeh kau rasa macam</malay> [eh] <malay>ni aku takyah tanya orang kau aku</malay> assume that <malay>walaupun susah</malay> but <malay>aku</malay> I can just Google <malay>apa</malay> Google is there for me to help <malay>boleh</malay> search <malay>senang-senang takyah kacau orang yang nak buat kerja dorang sendiri</malay>
but in
in that case that process is harder cause you are not
(uh) the the amid the Google search <malay>yang kau buat</malay>
it won't give you the exact results
cause the one that they show at Google and the one that you are doing it's not the same
so you'd have to nit pick some things properly for it to work <malay>kalau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau ikut</malay> [jer] it will definitely not work
ya which is hard for a person like me who does not
know programming that much
cause since okay [lah] before
uni [ah] you and me we went through that same course in poly it's ya it's all in about design art the aesthetics make it nice but go uni suddenly like (uh) you learn programming all this and that it's useful because [ah] we really learned through learn about design and all that so you have programming
in a way you can make your own game
but
(uh) how good is a game and like what I said the user experience must be
(uh) good ya must be in tip top condition cause if not right then you're just wasting your time just made the game but
[ah] exactly you're making a game for yourself but not for the people that's the one
(uh) biggest mistake that everyone who goes through this course or like everyone who makes a game
would not want to do because making a game especially if you want to sell the game you have to have a target audience and that target audience is what you have to make your game to work towards to
like if they are not happy with the game like your target audience <malay>macam budak-budak lima tahun sepuluh tahun</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau buat</malay> game <malay>macam</malay> five <malay>dorang main ke</malay> I mean
for educational purpose
ya like okay <malay>kalau aku</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> aim for
<malay>apa budak-budak yang dorang tak tahu belajar</malay> like <malay>tiga tahun empat tahun</malay> [ah] not not not not <malay>tak tahu belajar</malay> I mean <malay>tak tahu tak tahu buat</malay> math like <malay>aku bagi dorang</malay> game <malay>pasal</malay> math <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] <malay>dia nya macam</malay> quizzes <malay>aku bagi</malay> chemistry
<malay>lari</malay> [kan] that's why (err) that target audience is the most important thing when <malay>kau buat</malay> game <malay>macam untuk kau</malay> [eh] best [sia] game <malay>ni ada</malay> chemistry <malay>tapi kau tak tahu</malay> actually your audience is <malay>yang orang yang nak belajar pasal</malay> math
[oh] but okay [lah] cone
like iron man okay <malay>ni ni ni betul-betul</malay> (uh) off track
[ah] ironman like even though he's a millionaire but he's damn smart [lah] like he might be one of the inspiration where <malay>aku</malay> will continue programming because
in in a way like the universe even though is an alternate universe but it's an extreme point for for people who pushed themselves like that is a
possible
scenario <malay>kalau orang betul-betul</malay> don't have that drive to make suits to make all these right there is a possible future that we can aim for so <malay>aku rasa</malay> like programming is a
it's a good it's a
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
ya ingredient for humanity to take a step forward
[ah] ya same goes for elon musk actually elon musk is like the tony stark of our our earth [sia]
that's why <malay>aku</malay> really appreciate what elon musk has been doing now
that's why I also like Marvel and elon musk besides so hopefully we can go to mars in
at least twenty years [lah] give or take
in
[oh]
ya
strap [eh]
[orh] [oh] ya
probably they
I mean they will have a controlled environment <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>dia nya apa tu</malay>
<malay>apa tu</malay> [ah] <malay>udara udara dia macam ada dekat dalam</malay> this sphere <malay>abeh kalau ada ikut macam</malay> earth <malay>punya udara</malay> inside that sphere <malay>aku rasa</malay> everything should be fine <malay>kalau orang kena tanam ke apa</malay> there might be a proper grave for them <malay>cuma</malay>
it's weird [lah] it it's weird [ah] cause <malay>tak pernah dengar orang</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>mana kubur kau bukan kau</malay> [ah] <malay>mana kubur apa nenek kau ke apa</malay> [oh] <malay>dekat</malay> mars [ah] <malay>aku nak merawat</malay>
<malay>naik</malay> spaceship but that is a possible future also like <malay>kalau</malay> let's say when elon musk <malay>dia cakap</malay> (uh) human will be planetary existence in in the universe so imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you have your own spaceship <malay>macam kereta sekarang</malay> but <malay>kau nya</malay> spaceship <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>aku nak pergi</malay> [ah] moon <malay>jap kau nak makan</malay> [ah] moon burger [eh] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>kita gi makan sekarang</malay> K <malay>jap aku ambil</malay> spaceship <malay>aku</malay>
ya <malay>abeh kau</malay> [ah] fly [ah] okay [ah] <malay>ni</malay> set [ah] to moon then <malay>dia nya</malay> spaceship <malay>kau cakap</malay> okay (uh) ten minutes ride okay
<malay>abeh kadang-kadang pasal ni sekarang</malay> Grab [pe] so <malay>kau</malay> call (uh) space Grab
[eh] [eh] best [sia]
[oh] man I I don't know I don't know but it's not I think it's not light years
because I one light year if I'm not wrong is more than a thousand
no I don't I don't know
ya
exactly
probably with that technology we might not be alive [ah] to experience it
unless <malay>bila</malay> mars <malay>dah ada</malay> a way to like
persevere humanity to maintain young
[orh]
[ah] ya ya ya mine but then would it
actually be good
cause maybe some people
[oh]
[a'ah] #akaza#
a demon
[orh]
[oh] ya
maybe the thought of that like <malay>macam aku tahu aku tak mati</malay> so <malay>buat apa aku buat kerja ni semua</malay> you become complacent
then <malay>kau</malay> complacent then then there's no progress in life [lah] <malay>macam semua dah</malay> convenient <malay>untuk kau [pe]</malay> or <malay>aku boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>aku boleh tengok</malay> anime <malay>hari-hari aku tahu aku takkan mati</malay> [pe] so <malay>takyah belajar</malay> [ah] <malay>takyah belajar apa takyah mandi</malay> cause whatever it is even even though I am smelly or even though how much I don't brush my teeth
I will still stay young [what] I won't get sick right
so that complacency probably is what
makes humanity not to deserve to have a (um) <malay>apa</malay> eternal life
[ah]
[ah] upper moon
ya
same
(mm)
ya I guess that's the true meaning of like the beauty behind
not being able to live [ah] eternally or forever
because of complacency and also like
ya ya ya like what you said you'll feel stagnant so there's no progress which is why humans they keep on trying trying trying they know their life here is limited so they try their best as much as possible before they go off
like what they said (um)
the the things that you do the actions that you do
they are the ones that people will remember off when you die
but not the things like <malay>macam sekarang kau masih hidup abeh kau buat benda macam bagus macam</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni bagus</malay> [sia] okay <malay>dah tu</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>abeh kalau macam</malay> for example <malay>kalau</malay> michael jackson
<malay>dia buat buat lagu semua macam</malay> okay [lah] <malay>kalau dia tak mati</malay> it's still there [ah] <malay>tapi bila</malay> he died at at the time when he's still popular
so that makes his popularity increase because <malay>macam</malay> [oh] a legend it has it is a legend because
(err) people who die I don't know [ah] this this is like a a a way of people saying like it's a legend its when people die [lah] normally
ya
that's humans [lah] in a way [ah] that it's a beauty [ah] like when you die you leave a mark on human history so much that you become a figure
in the afterlife
not saying in the afterlife like don't know [lah] but
even if you die you you're you're you'll still remain in people's memory
[ah] set the bar
ya
so imagine if like [ah] the <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
[ah] wrestling or any any person in interest [lah] like [oh]
aha undertaker
even if he if he like die one day then he will
be considered a proper legend already [lah] even now he's a legend but the legend to me does not have any (uh)
impact yet
the same goes for <malay>ni</malay> [ah] the the the football legend
ya #maradona#
previously he did a lot of things that people don't really like
but when he die like a few (uh) weeks ago then suddenly like people respect him so much they bring about all the successes that he did but they don't think they don't talk much about his bad bad stuff
so what does that tell you
ya
[ah]
passing
[ah] ya ya
it's like it heightens your
<malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ada buat aku susah</malay> but
[ah] I guess you can say that
I I guess that that is can be applied for all the people who
does anime like demon slayer if the person really dies in the future then he'll definitely be remembered
for doing demon slayer
exactly bro four years imagine four years he does he (uh) that person does all this success and it's like right now the highest grossing anime film [eh] or highest grossing film in japan history like right now
which is why I love demon slayer
[ah]
exactly
which is why I like anime
ya so okay [lah] <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>banyak</malay> time [ah] <malay>ni tak banyak</malay> time sorry
stop [lah] am I at taiwan taiwan at times already [ah] okay [lah] hello [ah] actually [ah] K bye

<malay>asal semalam kau macam penat bila balik rumah</malay>
(hmm)
so you didn't submit your work yesterday
is it <malay>yang</malay> is it <malay>yang</malay> reflect journal is it the journal <malay>yang</malay>
[a'ah] I can hear you snoring from the hall <malay>itu</malay> [lah] it reminds me <malay>macam aku punya</malay> poly days whenever <malay>aku tengok muka kau penat</malay> [kan] like <malay>macam</malay> it reminds me of my poly
that's why <malay>kau akan nampak aku selalu satu malam</malay> [jer] <malay>dekat rumah tak buat apa-apa</malay> actually <malay>aku duduk dalam bilik fikir fikir-fikir benda</malay> but then
<malay>kau pun nampak</malay> [ah] at end of the day <malay>bila aku macam</malay> submission <malay>aku macam</malay> [oh] chill and happy and everything <malay>sebab tak fikir banyak</malay> then when is the start the semester start <malay>balik</malay> [lah] all the stress and all the <malay>macam</malay> [eh] don't disturb me now don't talk to me don't don't whatever don't
[eh] but <malay>kalau aku boleh</malay> pull through <malay>aku lagi</malay> design background I don't have any design background <malay>kita madrasah</malay> we don't have any art school <malay>tak ada</malay> D&T art and craft I cannot draw a straight line <malay>ke apa-apa</malay> but then
okay I cannot draw a circle straight line <malay>boleh</malay> with a ruler but then still <malay>aku</malay> manage to pull through [ah] so <malay>macam aku selalu tengok</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> stress [kan] <malay>aku fikir macam</malay> [ah] [lah] you are left with (err) one and a half more years you are already in two point two [ah] so are you excited for three point one !chey!
why [sia]
!huh! but you are in a school [what] <malay>kau kat</malay> polytechnic <malay>semua benda kau</malay> task to do you complete [what]
[eh] that actually happen to me <malay>bila</malay> poly (uh) <malay>apa ni bila</malay> during internship whereby <malay>aku punya</malay> internship [kan] <malay>aku</malay> design web design <malay>dengan</malay> digital pin
<malay>abeh</malay> time <malay>tu aku punya</malay> task <malay>untuk buat</malay> it was already <malay>aku punya</malay> internship was just three months long <malay>sebab kita punya</malay> <malay>panjang abeh</malay>
during <malay>aku</malay> [eh] three to four months internship so during <malay>macam</malay> like the first one third of the internship I had to design something for an overseas museum
so <malay>aku nak kena</malay> design <malay>macam dorang punya apa ni</malay> interactive <malay>punya benda</malay> and it's not even a topic that is being touched on <malay>dekat</malay> poly <malay>tak ada</malay> [pun] imagine <malay>kau kena buat</malay> <malay>punya benda</malay>
<malay>kira macam</malay> code <malay>tapi untuk</malay> <malay>punya</malay> system <malay>orang letak</malay> I pad <malay>dorang boleh</malay> scan <malay>abeh kita orang nak kena</malay> design that code
and actually at the start of the project it was only me and I had to design for four building <malay>pasal</malay> museum <malay>dia ada</malay> four buildings then I had to design all four outer thing so that when visitor <malay>datang dorang boleh</malay> scan <malay>benda tu</malay> initially <malay>aku kena buat sorang-sorang</malay>
then <malay>kau</malay> internship <malay>sama-sama dengan kawan</malay> [lah] ask your friend to internship like <malay>sama-sama</malay> company like apply together
<malay>mana tahu</malay> like <malay>macam kalau tak</malay> [kan] my company <malay>tiga orang</malay> apply three people apply me and <malay>apa ni kawan aku yang lelaki yang</malay> end up <malay>dengan sama-sama</malay> internship and another <malay>aku punya</malay> close friend but in the end <malay>dorang</malay> reject my close friend <malay>sebab ada dua</malay> intern <malay>kat</malay> company <malay>tu</malay> and <malay>dorang</malay> can only like
hire two interns at that point of time and is a good thing <malay>dia ada sebab dia</malay> more vocal than <malay>aku</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> because
I think it's because it's an environment whereby I'm not comfortable with it's an environment <malay>aku tak</malay> comfortable <malay>jadi macam</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> take a very long time to <malay>berbual</malay> even <malay>dengan aku punya</malay> supervisor but luckily but the thing is during <malay>aku punya</malay> internship [kan] is not the supervisor my supervisor <malay>dia macam</malay> assign assign <malay>benda</malay> [jer] <malay>dia cuma</malay> assign <malay>aku</malay> for one task which is to
it's a mural wall for a company <malay>yang dia dah buat cuma bila dia</malay> send <malay>dekat</malay> client client <malay>nak kena</malay> revise so <malay>aku yang</malay> revise that file which in the end <malay>bila aku</malay> submit <malay>balik sebelum aku habis</malay> internship <malay>aku punya</malay> supervisor <malay>kata aku buat salah abeh</malay> by then client <malay>dah</malay> accept <malay>aku punya</malay> design so <malay>macam</malay> (hmm) <malay>pandai-pandai</malay> [lah] <malay>kau kau betulkan aku punya</malay> file <malay>tapi</malay> client <malay>dah macam</malay> [eh] okay <malay>macam gitu tapi</malay> during <malay>aku punya</malay> internship was
<malay>aku punya kira macam</malay> senior one of <malay>kita orang punya</malay> senior <malay>dia macam</malay> higher <malay>sikit dari</malay> supervisor <malay>punya</malay> position <malay>dia yang apa ni</malay> (uh) overlook <malay>aku dengan ni pasal aku ada tiga</malay> project afterwards [kan] so this <malay>tiga</malay> project was overlook <malay>macam dia</malay> oversee <malay>kita punya</malay> design work <malay>bukan aku punya</malay> supervisor
<malay>cuma dia</malay> <malay>pasal aku punya</malay> mural wall
<malay>tapi</malay> client <malay>dah</malay> accept so <malay>macam aku nak pergi balik tempat tu abeh tengok</malay> mural wall <malay>tu pasal</malay> it's for <malay>pasal dorang sewa tempat</malay> this company <malay>punya</malay> one of the room so mural wall <malay>dia ada dekat</malay> company <malay>itu</malay> so <malay>macam kalau aku tebalkan muka</malay> maybe <malay>boleh datang tengok tapi jangan pergi atas</malay> [lah]
!huh! <malay>macam mana</malay>
do I know the person [oh] okay
<malay>dia punya</malay> company <malay>dia buat apa</malay> as in what is the
[oh]
research <malay>pasal</malay>
[ah] but then <malay>dia punya</malay> nature of the work <malay>tak perlukan dia</malay> to be in office <malay>lain macam</malay> like certain
courses <malay>ataupun kerja yang macam</malay> there was one guy the same area as <malay>aku punya</malay> internship <malay>pasal aku punya</malay> office based [kan] <malay>dia punya</malay> another group of friend from different course <malay>tapi kita orang punya</malay> course related to mass communication [eh] <malay>dorang bukan</malay> mass comm <malay>dorang</malay> communication design <malay>aku punya</malay> interactive media design so <malay>dorang punya</malay> is like <malay>dekat</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> printing factory [tau] so <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> whether <malay>kalau</malay> during that time [lah] if is like during period
<malay>abeh kalau kau macam</malay> magazine <malay>ke</malay> newspaper <malay>ke cetak buku sekolah ke</malay>
<malay>abeh siapa nak jaga</malay> machine <malay>kat sana</malay>
!wah! <malay>rabak</malay> [seh] can't imagine myself if during imagine you
I think the year ones and the year three had it difficult this year
<malay>kau ada kawan</malay> year one [kan]
[ah] <malay>lagi</malay> especially <malay>kita madrasah</malay> student [kan] <malay>jadi kita tak pernah</malay> exposed to like <malay>apa ni</malay> people from different races
different <malay>ya ke</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> all this while <malay>korang berbual kat sekolah berbual melayu</malay> [jer] [pe]
[ah] okay [lah] like during my time is like total culture shock <malay>aku kena joget semua</malay>
!wah! like looking back right <malay>macam haram</malay> [sia] <malay>aku buat semua</malay>
[ah] <malay>kau tak</malay> regret
ya I remember ya you had a <malay>apa ni</malay> project during secondary school I scolded you for like <malay>macam</malay> !huh! <malay>benda macam gini</malay> simple <malay>pun tak boleh buat</malay> ya that is so
<malay>kesian</malay>
pathetic <malay>pun ada</malay>
(um) [oh]
<malay>tak tahu apa nak buat</malay>
actually honestly [kan] like since <malay>aku</malay> first [kan] among <malay>kita punya</malay> siblings [kan] so <malay>macam aku tak ada kakak</malay> or <malay>abang</malay> to ask things from mummy and is like totally <malay>apa ni</malay> <malay>dorang tak tahu apa-apa</malay> and they depend on me <malay>kalau tak pun dorang tanya cik</malay> #shahrul# <malay>macam mana nak anuh ni semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dulu bila aku</malay> start <malay>pun kau nak tahu apa aku tanya kawan-kawan aku</malay> can imagine last time before <malay>kita ada</malay> internet at home
like I will go to the library my friend <malay>yang pandai</malay> internet
they will actually accompany me to the library and last time library we can rent hours <malay>pakai dia punya</malay> internet computer remember so <malay>aku pergi sana dorang tolong buatkan aku punya</malay> email <malay>dorang tolong buatkan aku punya</malay> friendster and things like that
yes it was really that bad <malay>tak akan aku nak tunjuk</malay> and you like what kindergarten <malay>lagi</malay> [pe] time <malay>tu</malay> like time <malay>tu</malay> I was
okay <malay>kau baru</malay> primary [kan]
no it was like primary four primary six ya [lah] ya so primary four primary six <malay>yang kita jalan gi apa ni</malay> #bedok# library no you know when I start reading book secondary one
or ask everytime <malay>nak pergi mana</malay> then I say or else mummy <malay>tanya aku macam kak nak gi mana nak pergi</malay> library so last time <malay>kalau nak buat</malay> research <malay>ke apa pergi</malay> library [ah] <malay>abeh tu</malay> then <malay>bila</malay> #abi# <malay>beli</malay> computer <malay>letak dekat bilik</malay> that's when slowly but then <malay>kita pakai</malay> internet <malay>untuk buat apa tengok</malay> youtube video game
ya so <malay>dulu pun macam</malay> struggle <malay>pun</malay> struggle <malay>sendiri juga</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] yes and that's the <malay>ni apa ni</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> by the time [kan] <malay>boleh nampak beza</malay> [tau] so time <malay>tu aku ingat masa aku</malay> tuition [ah] <malay>aku</malay> tuition <malay>dengan</malay> #kak mon# #kak mon# <malay>sama umur</malay> [kan] <malay>cuma aku</malay> first child <malay>dia</malay> third
third daughter
can't
so <malay>bila kita kat</malay> tuition I never felt the difference between me and #mon# so <malay>aku rasa macam kita orang sama merepek sama-sama ketawa sama-sama</malay> like we learn together we grew up together like we had <malay>silat</malay> and everything like that and like on these last few days of the <malay>kita orang punya</malay> tuition <malay>ni</malay> the <malay>kakak cakap</malay>
[ah] #mar# <malay>anak nombor berapa</malay> then I say first then #mun# <malay>berapa</malay> [oh] <malay>patut</malay> [lah] <malay>nampak beza</malay> then I was like !huh! there is a difference <malay>macam dia kata</malay> in how I do my work in how responsibility in how I act even though I feel like I act as childish as her <malay>macam aku merepek-merepek pun</malay> there is still a difference between
your level of #merepekness# [ah] things like that
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] so last time <malay>aku</malay> struggle [ah] <malay>kau nampak aku macam</malay> I had it all like some (uh) <malay>macam senang</malay> but actually I had to learn a lot of things by myself like <malay>macam mana nak pakai</malay> computer <malay>macam mana nak buat ni nak buat</malay> report <malay>macam mana nak buat</malay> homework okay of course I had tuitions [lah] back then but
I had tuition is about mummy and #abi# cannot help us
[ah] yes
<malay>memang kau tak tahu aku susah ke tak</malay>
<malay>dapat</malay> laptop
I deserve that first hand items !hey!
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>susah</malay> [kan] <malay>dulu hidup</malay>
and <malay>tak macam dulu</malay>
<malay>macam kau sekarang</malay> by then even though when you ask me how to do certain things I would <malay>macam</malay> !huh! <malay>benda macam gini pun kau tak tahu</malay>
but then <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>kau</malay> and last time it was not as <malay>apa ni</malay> is not an in thing
it is still new to the whole generation [tau] so <malay>macam memang kena belajar</malay> and last time I honestly I was one of the <malay>macam lembab</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> everyone have already have email friendster imagine the year <malay>aku buat</malay> friendster
<malay>dah tak</malay> popular by then I am not sure if it was facebook [oh] I think it was facebook facebook <malay>atau</malay> messenger it was the messenger <malay>yang</malay> popular
<malay>kau tak tahu</malay> messenger <malay>apa</malay> [kan]
<malay>dia macam</malay> chatting <malay>punya benda</malay>
<malay>itu pun</malay> I only
ya I only ya it's either hotmail <malay>ke</malay> microsoft so <malay>tapi</malay> by then <malay>aku dah ada</malay> messenger <malay>terus</malay> facebook <malay>dah</malay> popular so <malay>macam bila orang berbual pasal</malay> friendster <malay>aku macam</malay> (hmm) [oh] I also had friendster [oh] <malay>nama apa</malay> then I was like
(um) I don't remember my handle at all
ya those were the days [lah]
but I would love to go back to those days
less stressful than now
ya
if you okay <malay>kalau</malay> #aisha# <malay>ada</malay> time okay [lah] I know #aisha# <malay>baru masuk</malay> poly life [kan] like primary secondary poly two point two out of these stages of your life which one <malay>macam pada kau paling</malay> memorable <malay>sekali</malay>
why
last few years you mean
<malay>rabak</malay> in what sense
have to live up to the name of the monitress
but you are the monitress you have to be the responsible one [oh] so instead of monitor monitress other students is like monitress monitor
then why was he the monitor
<malay>tak ada satu pun jadi</malay> monitor <malay>ni atas dasar terpaksa pun jadi</malay> [lah]
(um) [oh] class voting
since but <malay>bila</malay> first time <malay>kau jadi</malay> monitress [kan] was it chosen by the form teacher or also was yes <malay>aku tahu aku</malay> favourite child favourite student
so sorry imagine if you were in school when we were still in school both me and <malay>abang</malay>
going [oh] [oh]
the thing
<malay>bila ni</malay> which year [oh] my god okay the cat is out of the bag secondary four it was during secondary four
for what subject for what subject <malay>cakap</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>dah lepas pun</malay>
[oh] where you guys go overseas
[ah] class <malay>ni tak payah dengar</malay> [lah]
[oh] because she was the same form teacher [oh] what
malay guy [oh] ya I think I know her okay [oh]
<malay>kat</malay> ear <malay>punya</malay> height [oh]
<malay>tak tinggi mana</malay> shoulder [oh]
polytechnic private
favourite [eh] I think in terms of memories
I would say secondary
it's about the thing is we've known each other since primary school because unlike you you are the system whereby after primary six you <malay>pilih</malay> which <malay>madrasah</malay> you want to go whether you want to focus academic girl probably but during <malay>kak punya</malay> time
<malay>kita orang tak ada pilihan</malay> unless you choose to change school then <malay>kita</malay> change school <malay>kalau tak</malay> all the way <malay>kita</malay> in the same school [lah]
so time <malay>tu bila dah masuk</malay> secondary [kan] <malay>bila</malay> primary [kan] <malay>kita orang macam</malay>
[ah] less drama more fun
so when it comes to secondary so all this while
[oh] okay I think for me I remember my primary school because the best year was during primary four
whereby madam #rosanna# was our form teacher and she taught us everything <malay>dia ajar</malay>
<malay>dia ajar</malay> [ah] english maths and science
so she taught all this three subjects okay so during lessons where everyday <malay>kita orang akan</malay> mix so someday we just do all english
because she is going to cover everything within all her periods and everything and during that time we have young entrepreneur scheme competition
whereby all of us work together you know one whole class [ah] like thirty five of us work together madam #rosanna# being herself a creative teacher she like do art project <malay>untuk kita orang semua</malay> and that's how we became closer especially during [ah] like even though there was six main members but behind the scenes like we came back to school during the june holidays
[ah] during the june holidays <malay>lepas itu kita orang apa ni buat</malay> artworks for example [ah] old vases <malay>kita orang</malay> paint <malay>balik</malay> to sell during our end <malay>kita orang punya tempat yang kita</malay> for the competition was at #tampines# mall you know where <malay>dorang</malay> have the bazaar <malay>sebelah</malay> #tampines# mall
every ramadan they have the bazaar <malay>hari raya</malay>
no even now <malay>yang kalau ada</malay> bazaar <malay>dekat</malay> #tampines#
yes so that was where we held the competition and everyone came imagine one of <malay>aku punya</malay> classmate <malay>dia kau tahu yang</malay> vanguard sheet it's not vanguard is it <malay>yang</malay> colour colour purple colour blue <malay>macam</malay> vanguard sheet [oh] my god it's been so long since I used that word vanguard sheet [ah]
so <malay>dia pakai macam</malay> vanguard sheet <malay>depan belakang</malay> and then <malay>dia jual</malay> envelope <malay>macam untuk</malay> envelope <malay>macam salam kahwin salam hari raya kita orang</malay> fold from wrapping paper and at the end of competition <malay>kita orang punya</malay> class <malay>dapat</malay> [eh] <malay>kita orang punya sekolah</malay> we first time <malay>arabia masuk</malay> and <malay>kita orang menang dapat</malay> fourth position
all thanks to madam #rosanna# so but she put the most effort [lah] because we were like only primary four <malay>kita berapa</malay> years old then ten years old we don't <malay>tak tahu banyak benda</malay> [kan] so then after that when <malay>kita orang dah bersatu hati bersatu padu</malay> primary four <malay>bila</malay> primary five <malay>kita</malay> split class
I also imagine like primary one primary two primary three and primary four
everyone was in the same class
they just <malay>tak ada</malay>
so last time during my <malay>dorang tak ada</malay> my time right <malay>dorang tak ada macam</malay> [ah] <malay>yang pandai</malay>
<malay>yang paling pandai yang pandai yang perlu bantuan untuk jadi lebih pandai tu tiga</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang tak ada</malay> split so all of us are in one class so it must have been a struggle for those <malay>yang susah juga</malay> [lah]
(uh)
<malay>korang</malay> seven levels [seh] A B C D E F six okay
and also the lower class [lah]
<malay>kesiannya</malay>
[oh] because they want you guys to focus on studies or [ah] but did you look forward to that camp so <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>kesah sangat</malay>
antisocial
okay then
antisocial [lah] <malay>tu</malay> so okay back <malay>tu aku punya cerita</malay> so <malay>bila</malay> primary five <malay>kita</malay> split class [tau] <malay>abeh kita orang punya</malay> class ground level ground level [kan] so <malay>satu</malay> class <malay>satu</malay> class it all happen when mummy [kan] <malay>dah</malay> start <malay>jual</malay> [kan] <malay>kat situ</malay> so <malay>aku selalu</malay> stay back
so I think there was a <malay>kita orang punya</malay> senior <malay>ke apa tak puas hati dengan</malay> some girl from of course [lah] boy so <malay>dorang macam</malay> unhappy with the between class five A and five B [ah] so boyfriend <malay>kat</malay> five B <malay>suka</malay> girl <malay>kat</malay> five A girl <malay>kat</malay> five A <malay>suka lelaki kat</malay> five B but lucky for five B they actually stayed back during primary six so girls primary six <malay>tak puas hati</malay>
so what happen was like one of <malay>kita orang punya</malay> time find that I always stay back <malay>pasal</malay> mummy <malay>jualan</malay> [kan] <malay>kat sekolah</malay> [kan] so <malay>aku tunggu</malay> [lah] mummy <malay>habis baru balik sama-sama</malay> what happen was them knowing that I always stay back you know what they do <malay>dorang koyakkan benda dalam</malay> class <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>dorang koyakkan benda dalam</malay> class <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> a few clique until today <malay>aku masih ingat pasal</malay> that is the same clique
who <malay>koyakkan aku punya</malay> duty roster <malay>bila</malay> secondary one
[ah] [ah] I hold grudge
<malay>kalau dengar</malay> okay so <malay>dorang dah koyakkan</malay> the duty roster and the next day <malay>bila</malay> five B <malay>datang dorang cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>aku yang koyakkan</malay>
<malay>sebab aku yang</malay> stay back
yes and ya ya <malay>pasal aku tak</malay> hold grudge <malay>sangat aku</malay> hold grudge yang secondary one <malay>punya tapi semua dah besar</malay>
so <malay>lepas tu</malay> then after that after that whole incident
<malay>mengamuk</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] because it was just not me I was with another friend <malay>kita orang sama-sama</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam tak mungkin aku koyakkan</malay> by the time <malay>akak balik dia pun balik</malay> so all this while <malay>kita orang sama-sama</malay> but the other class knowing that <malay>aku yang selalu</malay> stay back <malay>tunggu</malay> mummy
then <malay>dorang ni</malay> [ah]
or maybe <malay>bila aku tak ada dekat</malay> class I didn't stay at the classroom [what] I will just stay at the #musollah# <malay>ataupun dekat luar</malay>
[ah] so what happen afterwards was <malay>kita orang</malay> start to have extra classes after school hours so that's where the whole saga started <malay>dorang sembunyikan kasut hilangkan</malay> pencil box it's like to the extent one day after school <malay>semua orang kena</malay> stay back <malay>semua dari</malay> five A <malay>semua dari</malay> five B <malay>kena</malay> stay back <malay>aku daripada</malay> five A [kan] <malay>dengar</malay>
<malay>dorang tak tahu tu</malay> primary six <malay>aku tahu pasal siapa lagi</malay> yang stay back <malay>tapi pasal dia</malay> senior <malay>aku tak ada</malay> senior <malay>lagi nak tolong aku</malay> so it happen to the extent that madam #rosanna# form teacher <malay>kita orang bila</malay> primary four gather <malay>kita orang balik untuk berbual dengan kita orang</malay>
then I say you were together last year <malay>macam sama-sama apasal bila masuk</malay> primary five <malay>semua macam gini</malay> things like that so in the end <malay>kita salam</malay> and <malay>dah habis</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak ada orang nak mengaku sebab tak ada</malay> proof
we didn't have any proof that it was primary six but I knew because I know this <malay>kakak-kakak</malay> stay back
and I knew the history of all this <malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>orang tengah semua benda aku tahu</malay> [ah] yes
ya <malay>tapi</malay> time <malay>rapat dengan dia</malay> so ya
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kakak tak suka tu</malay> primary five <malay>bila</malay> but then <malay>bila dah masuk</malay> secondary <malay>kita masih</malay> split class <malay>sampai</malay> secondary one time <malay>tu pun</malay> sec one a <malay>lawan dengan</malay> sec one B
<malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>pasal kita</malay> just annoyed <malay>dengan dorang</malay> like there was this one trend <malay>semua orang akan pakai</malay> this jacket do you know my jacket <malay>bukan</malay> varsity jacket it was before varsity jacket it was like a hoodie jacket <malay>yang kau tahu yang</malay> grey and another pink
pink <malay>dengan</malay> blue star <malay>aku selalu pakai bila</malay> bila it was that trend that kind of jacket and ya backpack <malay>kat belakang</malay> do you know what <malay>aku punya</malay> backpack <malay>yang</malay> colour brown <malay>yang boleh</malay> clip ya okay it was a trend and there's this one group of girls <malay>dorang pakai tu</malay>
and I was so annoyed <malay>pasal dorang macam</malay> flaunt <malay>dorang punya</malay> because it was in trend and <malay>dorang macam</malay> flaunt and the whole group <malay>nanti ambil gambar</malay> and things like that <malay>abeh aku</malay> annoyed <malay>gila</malay> [seh] so <malay>aku pun tak suka dorang</malay> then comes the teacher day <malay>punya</malay> time [tau] so <malay>bila tengah</malay> teacher day <malay>punya</malay> time one of <malay>aku punya</malay> classmate instead of <malay>tolong</malay> decorate <malay>aku punya</malay> class
<malay>dia pergi kelas sebelah tolong</malay> decorate [kan] <malay>kelas sebelah kita orang dah macam</malay> [oh] my god <malay>abeh kita orang memang tak puas hati dengan dorang</malay> until <malay>dorang</malay> secondary one
then <malay>bila kita orang masuk</malay> secondary two <malay>kita sama kelas balik</malay>
so it was like primary five primary six secondary one
<malay>kita orang</malay> different class after that <malay>bila masuk balik</malay> secondary everyone was in the same class secondary two <malay>pasal</malay> by then pun <malay>kita dah pindah dekat</malay> #toa payoh# [kan] so classroom <malay>dah lagi besar</malay> so <malay>bila yang</malay> secondary two <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>kita orang macam ada</malay> certain <malay>orang kita tak</malay> click <malay>sebab dia gatal</malay>
but other certain students we are okay with them [ah] by then <malay>kita dah</malay> quite click then after that <malay>bila masuk</malay> secondary three end of secondary three <malay>kita ada</malay> secondary three camp
[ah] whereby <malay>dalam</malay> secondary three camp because we have never been in situation whereby <malay>kita orang semua sama-sama</malay> except <malay>kita orang punya macam apa ni tidur kat sekolah bulan ramadan punya</malay> time
so other than <malay>kita orang semua tak sama-sama</malay> actually <malay>bila</malay> camp <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>semua orang</malay> start <malay>rapat</malay>
<malay>tak kita tidur pasal penat</malay>
(um) level one <malay>ni kat sekolah mana</malay>
[ah] level one meaning
[oh]
should be something stupid
girls
[oh]
I think the only time whereby <malay>kita orang tak tidur sekolah</malay> so last time <malay>kita ada</malay> was one week and
<malay>apa ni kita orang ada</malay> arabic paper and among all the paper of course arabic language <malay>paling susah</malay> [kan] so what was <malay>ustazah</malay> #mashallah# <malay>beterima kasih dia sanggup tidur</malay> a day before the paper I think that was thursday <malay>kira</malay> arabic paper was on friday so <malay>dia tidur kat sekolah dengan kita orang</malay> so the reason why <malay>kita semua tidur kat sekolah</malay> was to revise our arabic
and in the end we didn't really revised instead <malay>kita</malay> of course girls being girls when we are together <malay>kita orang ketawa-ketawa</malay> and the thing is only girls <malay>yang tidur</malay>
<malay>kat sekolah</malay> and there was only one <malay>ustaz</malay> and another male student to accompany the <malay>ustaz</malay> [lah] is the only guy in school <malay>ustaz</malay> was there to look after us [lah] <malay>tak akan kalau</malay> all girls <malay>kalau apa-apa jadi kat sekolah apa jadi</malay> [kan]
then after that during <malay>kita orang punya ni ada</malay> something happen again so <malay>kita orang tidur dekat</malay> creepy honestly even <malay>bila</malay> camp <malay>bila ada kat situ itu jangan cakap aku buat bodoh</malay> and last time <malay>tak ada cermin</malay> last time there was no mirrors then we <malay>bila dah</malay> new <malay>sikit</malay> that is scary [lah] so last time <malay>bila masih tengah kat</malay> <malay>kita orang semua tengah duduk</malay> it was already at eleven plus
[mah] then <malay>kita orang pun dah habis</malay> revise because we going to wake up earlier before <malay>subuh</malay> the next day to like refresh before we keep school because school <malay>kat sekolah</malay> [kan] exam <malay>dia esok pagi semua</malay> student <malay>datang balik</malay> [ah] <malay>dekat arabiah dekat</malay> hall
then <malay>lepas tu</malay>
so was it in hall
no I don't think it was in hall it was in one of the classroom <malay>yang tingkat dua hujung sini yang</malay> facing parade square I think it was there
<malay>lepas tu</malay> what happen was we were just talking amongst ourselves and you know the sound whereby <malay>kereta jalan</malay> then <malay>bunyi</malay> imagine #ustaz muhammad# <malay>kereta</malay> was parked
no he was parked there he was parked way before so <malay>tak gerakkan kereta pun</malay> <malay>semua orang</malay>
[ah]
<malay>yang kereta jalan</malay> ya
except for staff
park <malay>kereta dekat depan</malay>
other side
[oh] <malay>yang sebelah</malay> security <malay>punya</malay> ya
and it couldn't be from the road <malay>pasal</malay> road <malay>dah jauh</malay>
the real do
[oh] ya
so <malay>kakak punya</malay> the more okay I
<malay>tak pernah</malay> experience <malay>benda-benda seram</malay>
<malay>sampai orang</malay> point out
so meaning <malay>ataupun</malay> staycation <malay>ingat</malay> staycation <malay>dekat dengan</malay> old #changi# hospital
I know the place is eerie but I don't sense or feel <malay>pasal aku tak nak takutkan diri aku sendiri macam kau tahu aku takut tengok cerita hantu</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>aku macam tahu tempat dia</malay> very eerie very <malay>seram</malay>
our chalet time <malay>kita ambil yang paling hujung sekali</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi aku tak cakap apa-apa cuma bila dah habis</malay> the whole thing <malay>baru orang cakap kau rasa bila</malay> [oh] it wasn't only me
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay> okay <malay>tapi itu bukan</malay> the most scariest experience <malay>aku ada</malay> the one imagine <malay>ada satu kali tu kita orang ada</malay> staycation [eh] <malay>bukan</malay> staycation <malay>yang</malay> chalet <malay>dekat</malay> #pasir ris#

okay let's not talk about this anymore so then <malay>cepat-cepat</malay> [ah] <malay>habiskan dorang yang tidur sana selamat macam gitu</malay>
but you don't seem like one <malay>aku nak tengok cerita hantu</malay>
mafia
for telegram <malay>ke</malay>
spy [lah] spy four
classroom <malay>yang mana</malay> which classroom
[oh] [ah] okay
so you will like
keep pointing fingers but no knowing who is the <malay>dia punya ni</malay>
but did you guys select the correct number of people playing
[ah]
<malay>mengundang</malay> [kan] <malay>mengundang</malay>
but those one of the stupid things <malay>korang buat lepas aku</malay> it was polytechnic <malay>punya</malay> time like it was during it was between <malay>kita orang punya</malay> from one class to another [oh] from one consultation to another consultation the session <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> [eh]
no it was during year three three point one where we still have a few attorney modules final modules to the end
ya but it's that is like the
other half
so <malay>macam daripada</malay> april to like before the september october september holiday I take a few module then after september october november is so september october november was my internship december came back to school for
all the way till april [lah]
[eh] all the way to january [eh] march all the way to march [lah]
then <malay>kita orang tengah tengok</malay> so from one class to another class is like three hours break <malay>pasal kita orang punya</malay> class straight so during that three hours we have our own <malay>lepak</malay> place and only we can enter only my course mates can enter the class [ah] tap to <malay>masuk</malay>
<malay>pasal lain semua tak boleh masuk</malay> so it became our <malay>macam</malay> hangout room for our course [ah]
so what happened was the <malay>dia punya</malay> laptop computer is inside a cupboard so the lecturer needs the key to open up certain things in order for him to play the project plan everything him being him
the most creative guy ever
<malay>tak tahu macam mana dia buat terus boleh pakai</malay> projector <malay>semua</malay> so <malay>kita</malay> have access to <malay>main cerita dia macam</malay> cupboard <malay>dia buka</malay>
<malay>dia yang buka</malay> the whole thing [ah] so <malay>kita buat</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>pakai macam</malay> ruler I don't know how he open I think it was just a <malay>macam</malay> he needs to put his hand into something to take out the wire that connects from the laptop to the projector so he managed to do that so even when the lecturer pass by <malay>dorang pun tak cakap apa-apa</malay> so
<malay>tak ada apa-apa</malay> [lah] so should be okay so <malay>kita tengok</malay> movie so like majority of us were in the class <malay>tengah tengok</malay> movie and
since <malay>dia</malay> is a glass door <malay>dia</malay> glass door <malay>kita kena orang luar boleh nampak kita</malay> but then the glass door <malay>dia tutup dengan</malay> projector <malay>kau faham</malay> [ah] so <malay>kita</malay> facing projector <malay>belakang</malay> projector glass door <malay>kira orang lalu boleh nampak tengah tengok</malay> so like <malay>macam</malay> some of my classmate <malay>dorang tak nak duduk tengok</malay> movie <malay>dorang nak keluar</malay> or <malay>lepak</malay> with others the mix [ah] from different courses or just <malay>nak pergi</malay> lunch so one of <malay>aku punya kawan masuk dia cakap</malay> [eh] what you guys are watching you know what we are watching shaun the sheep
the average age of students in the class were like what between
seven [eh] <malay>bukan</malay> eighteen nineteen eighteen to like the oldest one twenty six <malay>umur yang</malay> twenty six <malay>yang buka cerita</malay> shaun the sheep <malay>kau faham tak</malay> so we were watching shaun the sheep <malay>abeh kelakar-kelakar dah ketawa ketawa ketawa</malay> after that <malay>kita tengok cerita apa</malay> [tau] final destination five
the the contrast between the two movies so the friend <malay>yang</malay> shaun the sheep <malay>keluar dia masuk balik</malay> [kan] <malay>kita tengok</malay> final destination five <malay>dia macam</malay> !wow! you guys [ah] <malay>asal tengok</malay> one <malay>cerita</malay> to the other <malay>tapi kita tengok pun ketawa-ketawa</malay> but that was one of the best <malay>ni</malay> [lah]
and another best thing I <malay>yang kita orang pernah buat</malay> was
<malay>main</malay> hide and seek <malay>dekat</malay> airport
poly
<malay>akak punya</malay> clique my clique <malay>dengan</malay> a few guys so time <malay>tu kita orang dah habis</malay>
I think <malay>sebab kita orang habis sekolah siang ke apa ke pasal</malay> that day I think that day was
<malay>kita orang main</malay> terminal two <malay>kita orang main</malay> terminal two [ah] <malay>kita orang main</malay> hide and seek the thing is <malay>kita orang tak boleh</malay> hide <malay>dekat</malay> toilet [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> boys <malay>tak boleh masuk</malay> girls toilet girls <malay>tak boleh masuk</malay> but it was so fun
we should play hide and seek at the airport you know
okay [lah] not now [lah] but
should play like if you have like a large group of friends to play <malay>main</malay> hide and seek <malay>paling</malay> best
!huh!
[ah] going to another classroom
thinking of all the possibilities that it could not be what I thinking it is
ya and then I ask my friend [lah] which I
and why you describing it to me now I'm starting to imagine okay
(um)
[ah]
are you sitting by the window
[ah] <malay>teman</malay>
[ah]
<malay>kau dah dengar cerita aku punya bukan cerita seram kelakar seram</malay> [ah] so during <malay>kita orang punya</malay>
secondary four secondary five <malay>kita pergi</malay> malaysia
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] no is different <malay>tak ada</malay> during our time <malay>tak ada</malay> such thing
so was when the graduating batch went a year before they graduate <malay>kita pergi</malay> overseas <malay>kita pergi</malay> malaysia and visit universities to <malay>macam kononnya</malay> future <malay>nak kenal-kenal</malay> [ah] universities <malay>luar</malay> singapore
so <malay>kita orang semua dapat bilik</malay> hotel okay [lah] actually <malay>ni cerita seram</malay> [ah]
so <malay>kita orang dapat bilik</malay> hotel so there are <malay>kita orang dibagi</malay> like our classes are being divided into three levels so example <malay>dia</malay> level seven eight nine so level seven <malay>semua</malay> guys
level nine <malay>semua</malay> girls
level eight either mix of guys either mix of girls
so <malay>macam</malay> guys <malay>punya</malay> room this thing is the guys room is <malay>sebelah depan</malay> girls room <malay>sebelah belakang</malay>
so there was this one time
<malay>jauh daripada</malay> lift so you have to walk in like <malay>macam</malay> and my room is one of the last few room for that floor <malay>kita orang punya</malay> that level <malay>kita punya</malay> room last few
<malay>akak punya bilik</malay>
and #kak mun# was also on the same floor so <malay>kita dua bukan</malay> the type <malay>yang akan takut</malay> because we usually travel go hotel [kan] so <malay>macam benda ni tak akan</malay> occur unless before this <malay>kita ada dengar orang-orang berbual</malay> which
unfortunately they did talk about or all these things that happen in their room [lah] so time <malay>tu kita ada</malay> <malay>ada macam</malay> seminar <malay>sekejap atau kat atas kat macam dia punya</malay> hall [ah] so <malay>aku dengan</malay> #kak mun# <malay>pun terlupa</malay> something so <malay>kita orang kena</malay> rush <malay>pergi bilik</malay> so #kak mun# <malay>dengan bilik aku sama</malay> level [ah]
so <malay>kita masuk terus</malay> time <malay>tu ada</malay> hall and it's a long way [tau] like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] the corridor <malay>macam panjang</malay> have to pass by around ten rooms
the room <malay>dia macam</malay> zig zag
so #kak mun# <malay>punya</malay> room is around seven <malay>aku punya</malay> room eleven <malay>tak salah</malay>
<malay>sama</malay> floor <malay>tak ada dalam bilik tu ada empat orang dua</malay> sec five <malay>dua</malay> sec four <malay>dua</malay> sec five <malay>dua</malay> sec four <malay>dorang</malay> split <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah]
<malay>lepas tu kita orang lari</malay>
<malay>terus aku tengok</malay> #kak mun# <malay>tengok</malay> each other <malay>lari masuk bilik letak benda lari</malay>
<malay>patah balik</malay> all the way
<malay>itu</malay> the worst experience
<malay>tak</malay> they dim the whole the very old school <malay>punya macam</malay> yellow light corridor and the carpet was red

sometimes they okay instead okay sometimes it's like it's either <malay>kau buka</malay> computer then like
Zoom <malay>semua kau akan berbual</malay> with your <malay>cikgu</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi aku punya</malay> [kan] it's like we talk

it's like damn fun because it's like
(um) that one whole week right they don't give like
one assignment
on one day it's like
one assignment like five question like monday until wednesday then that's your deadline wednesday night
so one of our question [eh] sometimes cause
okay our [kan] like intern intern [kan]
so like rarely they know
like about us
so one of their question that they ask
was what [ah]
if you can be any kind of colours what will you be
so what is your answer
ya
why
(mm)
can it's up to you but why
white stands for purity okay then
for your inner soul
<malay>apa</malay> inner soul <malay>kau</malay>
(mm) ya maybe [ah] a bit of both
okay you <malay>kau</malay> guess <malay>apa aku</malay> choose
why blue do I look like a blue
no [oh] my god okay correct answer but <malay>aku</malay> chose orange
okay cause orange [kan] is like more of sunset it's like most of the basic [eh] the main colour of sunset is orange
ya so I just chose orange [lah] at first I don't know but then
<malay>aku cakap</malay> like since I like sunset then like the
primary colours is orange [kan] so <malay>aku cakap</malay> [ah] like (um)
<malay>aku</malay> chose orange <malay>sebab</malay> it's the primary colors of sunset and
sunset is like represent of me [ah] <malay>macam dia</malay> can make my soul like very calming
ya so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay [ah] then end up <malay>aku dapat</malay> five points
ya
serious
I think whoever work like
on air right stewardess
they enjoy like they can see all those sunset and sunrise [sia]
ya
yup true
I want to be stewardess but then end end up <malay>aku pakai hijab</malay> so like cannot
actually can
fly emirates
<malay>kawan aku</malay> [eh] no #huda's# sister <malay>yashira dia</malay>
ya <malay>tapi dia sudah</malay> quit <malay>sudah</malay>
she [oh] cause <malay>aku cakap dengan dia</malay> like <malay>aku nak jadi</malay> air stewardess
then she said like go [ah] like try but then <malay>aku cakap</malay> like
cause I'm using <malay>hijab</malay> [what] so it's hard
then <malay>dia cakap</malay> she have friends that during flight like on air then they open then after <malay>bila</malay> touchdown they will use back
but for me like complicated like you know <malay>macam</malay>
you know like you get what I mean
<malay>macam</malay> it's so <malay>pelik</malay> like ya but I really want [sia]
ya that's why <malay>tapi macam</malay>
the thing is [kan] <malay>kalau kau</malay> [eh]
<malay>kalau kau</malay> on the way <malay>kerja</malay> that means <malay>kau tak pakai tudung</malay>
so I think <malay>kalau kau sudah</malay> fly #bangkok# or something then
<malay>bila kau sudah sampai</malay> hotel <malay>kau nak keluar balik</malay> then <malay>kau pakai tudung</malay>
so <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>kalau</malay> like <malay>kau punya kawan macam</malay>
they say like [eh] just now like I thought you never like you know like people assume [what] [eh] you use <malay>tudung</malay> you know
it's damn crazy
ya
I don't think I can
like I would rather
have like okay not flexible work but
I don't like that kind of
like <malay>macam</malay> back to back
schedule
my body like need rest
ya
but <malay>kau pergi</malay> #bangkok# <malay>bila</malay>
(mm) <malay>aku</malay>
I'm still finding jobs but then right it's so hard
like you know okay just now I saw this job search
for temperature screener <malay>dia dekat</malay> #bukit batok# hospital
so <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> it's like not flexible but then it's like it's a hospital <malay>tapi tak ada</malay> aircon
[kan] <malay>pelik dia cakap</malay> like note [kan] <malay>dia cakap</malay> below like for the note they said (um)
<malay>tak ada</malay> aircon so like whoever like shortlisted
like have to make sure like they are comfortable with non aircon area
so <malay>pada aku macam</malay> hospital <malay>apa tak akan tak ada</malay> aircon
no [ah] but
I never apply <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>nampak sahaja</malay> then <malay>aku macam</malay>
[lah] aircon <malay>tak ada biar</malay> like I don't want like I want I need
to work somewhere that have aircon or like a fan [lah] at least
that time [kan] <malay>aku dapat</malay> okay someone I got
okay not <malay>dapat</malay> like they replied to me
so <malay>aku tanya</malay> like hi is this work still available
then [kan] end up <malay>orang itu cakap</malay> ya okay still have available
<malay>tapi</malay> the thing [eh] it's so annoying like <malay>dia orang cakap ada</malay> available
then <malay>dia orang suruh aku</malay> send resume but then they don't reply to it
so <malay>aku pergi</malay> double text like okay I was being annoying <malay>tapi</malay> <malay>aku</malay> need a job
and <malay>dia orang sudah cakap aku</malay> it's available so <malay>aku cakap</malay>
(um) hi excuse me like so is the job still available <malay>aku</malay> double text [tau]
then after that
(err) <malay>dia cakap</malay> hi yes (err) <malay>dia cakap</malay> hi yes sorry like still have
then <malay>dia tanya aku kalau aku boleh kerja</malay>
(um) <malay>dekat</malay> heat <malay>tak sebab dia macam</malay> open space
so the the open space <malay>macam kot</malay> you know the security guard guard post
okay so
<malay>aku sudah aku cakap</malay> okay ya sure like whatever [lah] I just need the money
then end up <malay>orang itu cakap</malay>
(um) okay there's no aircon so are you sure you're okay with it
so <malay>sudah aku sudah cakap</malay> yes I'm okay <malay>tapi dia mati-mati macam tanya</malay> like

so <malay>aku cakap</malay> (mm)
okay at least it's like is there any like fan or something like cause it's a guard post [what]
so obviously there's fan
so <malay>aku rasa dia</malay> annoyed <malay>macam bila aku macam tanya</malay> like <malay>kalau ada</malay> aircon <malay>ke ada</malay> fan then <malay>dia tak</malay> reply <malay>aku</malay> [sia]
like how how rude is that like I just want to know if there's aircon [eh]
if there's fan since you said is non aircon and it's open space so obviously
they must install like fan [what]
<malay>tak akan</malay> whoever <malay>kerja sana macam</malay> just <malay>mati</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> heat <malay>dia</malay>

(um) <malay>apasal</malay> like <malay>mariam nak kena</malay> expose <malay>aku</malay> like
why must she tarnish my name by saving her boyfriend's name
<malay>habis</malay> sarah <malay>pergi</malay> reply <malay>dia cakap</malay>
technically it's your fault because you started the topic first
then after that <malay>aisha cakap</malay> [ah] like (um) like I don't know she was just like saving her own ass
then after that <malay>betul</malay> [pe] like story <malay>itu</malay> is #zeko's# story <malay>tapi apasal kau pergi bilang</malay> mama
<malay>habis</malay> sarah <malay>cakap kau fikir mariam nak</malay> sit back
(err) <malay>habis</malay> like just see like you talking about the boyfriend's name to mama like you know
then #aisha# say [oh] <malay>gitu</malay> then <malay>aku macam</malay>
like you get what mean <malay>macam</malay> I'm not saving anyone's ass but it's just that
it's just #zeko's# ranting to you then end up you have to tell mama about it
and and one thing I don't like about #aisha# [kan] <malay>dia macam</malay>
how to say [ah] like she always talks about her friend's problem but then she don't talk about her problem
like one time she <malay>macam</malay> she <malay>balik</malay> the she said (um)
<malay>apa tu</malay> [oh] she went out to eat with #haziq# like one of her friends [ah] <malay>yang pernah suka dia</malay>
then after <malay>dia cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>haziq sekarang bawa</malay> motor <malay>ini ini ini</malay> then <malay>dia cakap tapi dia nak tukar</malay> like <malay>kau tahu macam</malay>

like
<malay>dia tak tanya aku</malay> permission <malay>untuk pakai kasut itu</malay> like out of nowhere <malay>aku nampak kasut aku keluar dari kotak</malay>
then after that <malay>aku</malay> text <malay>dia aku cakap</malay> one more time if I see my shoes like this
I will throw your nike inside the water
<malay>sebab dia punya</malay> nike [kan] she's very protective of it
so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay like I understand like I won't use it because it's <malay>mahal</malay>
then after that (err) <malay>dia cakap</malay>
(err) <malay>dia cakap</malay> I was airing it [lah] <malay>habis dia cakap</malay>
<malay>dia pergi bilang kat</malay> sarah <malay>dia cakap</malay> why #mariam# so rude then <malay>pada aku macam</malay> it's basic [what] it's <malay>kasut</malay> birthday <malay>aku habis kau pakai macam sesuka hati kau</malay> [ah]
<malay>habis</malay> after <malay>dia cakap dengan aku</malay> (err) okay [lah] so from now
(err) you just use your own stuff I use mine like stop bothering me so <malay>pada aku macam</malay>
the least you can say is sorry [what] like at least <malay>aku jaga barang kau baik-baik habis dia nak cakap dia cakap</malay> sarah like
(um) <malay>aku pakai barang dia semua tak minta</malay> permission like bag <malay>dia kenapa macam aku sudah</malay> make it <malay>aku sudah minta kau</malay> permission it's just that <malay>kau macam tak</malay> acknowledge it you know
then <malay>aku macam</malay> [ah] whatever [lah] then (err) <malay>dia cakap dengan</malay> sarah I want to buy shoes so like
(err) #mariam# don't have to like nag then <malay>aku macam</malay> I won't nag if you don't
if you know how to like
ya if you know how to take care of my shoes you know that time one time right I washed it
then out of no where suddenly the next day <malay>dia pakai</malay> then <malay>ada kotor lagi</malay> like do you know how pissed I was like
<malay>aku baru cuci</malay> like <malay>sudah bersih habis</malay> like <malay>kau pergi pakai</malay>
like you have a lot of like expensive shoes like go use [lah] but then end up <malay>kau nak pakai aku punya</malay> <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>dua ratus yang kau sudah cakap yang</malay> [lah] <malay>aku boleh beli habis pergi</malay> [lah] <malay>beli</malay> like you know <malay>macam</malay> it's so annoying like
(err)
annoying <malay>satu kali itu yang</malay> like these few days like we've been like <malay>macam</malay>
(um) how to say [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
!huh!
okay not really arguing like okay you know that tension in the air
ya like <malay>macam</malay> these past few days [ah] like me and #aisha# we have like this tension then sarah <malay>satu kali</malay>
(oo) I sense tension then <malay>aku macam</malay> [ha] [lah] <malay>kau</malay> just stop
cause
I I won't say it's okay [ah] but
I don't know [lah] I mean if she say she will stop using my stuff then okay [lor] but
I doubt she will stick to that
confirm <malay>nanti balik</malay> [kan] <malay>dia akan cakap aku</malay> (err) <malay>pergi buka beg sekolah aku</malay> cause that time I use her bag
confirm [one] then
but then <malay>aku</malay> still haven't use her nike shoes so now I'm just trying to find like
a way to use it
no okay cause okay one thing for me right I will ask permission but then for her right she won't
she won't ask permission for her <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>kau tengah tidur kau tengah tidur</malay> so like <malay>aku sudah tanya sudah</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> what what common sense is that like I don't get it
no
<malay>aku penat</malay> [sia] rant <malay>pasal dia</malay>
okay so one thing about sarah her size is small
that's why so it's like she don't have this kind of thing where we have to argue about shoes like
cause me and #aisha# our shoe size is not that
far [lah] it's quite same but then sarah is just way out of like just <malay>terjauh</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> that time <malay>aku pakai kasut</malay>
(um) merry [eh] <malay>kasut apa tu</malay> doctor mart
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak boleh</malay> fit <malay>aku boleh</malay> fit but it's so <malay>ketat</malay> like is it the first time when you use it will be like damn pain or what
cause <malay>aku tengok huda pakai sudah macam kasut ke bawah blok</malay> [tau] <malay>dia pakai macam</malay> just
like comfortable
ya <malay>tapi</malay> sarah <malay>punya</malay> is not my size so <malay>bila aku pakai</malay> it's like extra <malay>ketat</malay> and like pain
but then <malay>kalau aku</malay> lose the <malay>macam</malay> the strap <malay>dekat belakang</malay> [kan] then when I walk it's more uncomfortable cause my <malay>kaki</malay> will <malay>ternaik</malay>
you get what I mean
that's why so like I was thinking if I should buy
like for next year birthday present but then the thing is
<malay>aku macam</malay>
<malay>malas nak</malay> go through [ah] the blister blister
<malay>aku punya kasut yang</malay> doctor mart <malay>yang</malay> high cut <malay>dulu itu</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi dia</malay> #swee# #swee# [jer] [seh]
[a'ah] <malay>macam</malay> since
<malay>dulu bila aku pakai</malay> like okay <malay>dia macam</malay>
#swee# #swee# <malay>tapi</malay> like there's a little bit of space <malay>tapi sekarang sudah</malay> #swee# #swee# so like
<malay>aku</malay> cannot use thick socks I have to use like
not thick socks but then like still a long socks for me
so I really don't know like sarah can use [lah] but then she rarely use
those kind of
ya
so
I mean I have a lot of like outfits to like match with it but then
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak nak</malay> like <malay>kaki aku</malay> blister
like no thanks later will ruin all the fun because I will complain about my blister and all
<malay>berapa banyak</malay> doc mart [ah] <malay>kau ada</malay>
ya
one okay I saw two of it what's the another one
[oh] [oh] okay okay okay okay
[ah] but you rarely use that now
no you can just use it anywhere like go lot
hillion
don't lie sometimes your simple is like <malay>aku pakai lepak</malay> then end up <malay>macam</malay> dressed up don't lie don't lie I know you
<malay>macam</malay> rare occasion
<malay>aku pun</malay>
okay now
I just need to find high waisted white
[oh] if I take one of your high waisted I can use to match my flower <malay>baju</malay>
the ones that you always use the high waisted <malay>yang</malay> flair
<malay>yang macam</malay> boyfriend's jeans but then that one is the high waisted one
white white
you have right
ya I think that one can match my <malay>baju</malay> because
okay I have to bring that <malay>baju</malay> to you <malay>sebab dia kat bawah (um) <malay>tali</malay> [tau]
so <malay>kalau aku pakai</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau aku pakai</malay> like normal jeans <malay>kalau aku naikkan tangan aku dia akan ternaik</malay>
that's why I need something that is like secured to
(err) [ah] ya I think so I think so
ya <malay>dia bukan</malay> skinny <malay>dia</malay> (um) flare <malay>yang macam</malay> boyfriend's jeans kind
you know right
ya because that <malay>baju</malay> since that time [seh] my mum buy but then I haven't use yet cause I cannot find like the correct

ya but some people do that without like
you know being feared of it

but then like <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>macam</malay> you grow up being rich
like you grow up with like a mansion like you don't have to worry about anything
it's so it's so fun
okay <malay>aku tanya kau</malay> [eh] what's one topic right
<malay>kau</malay> don't want to talk about
like <malay>macam</malay> sarah right and her <malay>kawan</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> one topic her <malay>kawan macam</malay> don't like to talk about is like <malay>macam</malay> sex
ya but then <malay>aku tengah terfikir</malay> like <malay>kawan aku</malay> okay <malay>kawan aku aqilah</malay> [kan]
she don't like to talk about money
ya <malay>macam</malay> okay example like <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kawan aku tanya aku</malay> [oh] bank <malay>engkau berapa</malay> like <malay>aku cakap</malay> [oh] nine dollar
<malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> it's so flow and easy <malay>tapi</malay> for <malay>aqilah macam kira dia macam berapa</malay> [sia] bank <malay>engkau</malay> like we want check like
cause <malay>kita semua tak nak keluarkan duit</malay> then for #aqilah# [kan] <malay>kita semua diri dekat tepi dia</malay> then <malay>dia pergi</malay> cover [tau] <malay>dia punya</malay> account
<malay>dia punya</malay> that screen then <malay>kita macam berapa</malay> [seh] <malay>kau ada berapa</malay> [seh] <malay>kau ada</malay> then <malay>aqilah cakap tak ada</malay> [lah] like nothing like not much
cause but I think confirm a lot cause she work as bond
like after her poly then she will work like this company [ah] then they will pay her eight hundred
eight hundred every month like ever since she started her bond so <malay>macam</malay> I think two years already her bond like

ya it's quite old right for someone his age to be doing
it's (err) respectable [lah] for the craft of
ya
(mm)
ya understandable [lah]
[oh] ya ya she she's I think five months
so you expect the baby to appear at [eh] appear [eh] they expect for the baby to be born [lah] in (err) <malay>dalam</malay> late november <malay>begitu</malay>
so

time right
ya and I and my <malay>kakak</malay> #wen# is the
<malay>anak pertama</malay> [lah] to carry a child for the family
so
I think my dad and mum pretty excited [ah]
ya
[oh] true true
so ya my my mother and my (uh) brother-in-law <malay>punya</malay> mother both of them plan out [lah] the this party for us
so <malay>harap harap</malay> (err) it's going to be fun (err) it's gonna happen I think [ah] early next month also

nah who who who I mean
(mm) government [lah] they will know that is more than the allowed number [ah] so
ya it's going to be a small one [lah] only five of us only so
ya it's just one small group of us
ya
you want to try to curb the amount of
interaction
ya normal
the government <malay>punya pantang larang</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti ikut</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> respect respectable [lah]
[eh] <malay>jangan</malay> [lah]
<malay>malu</malay> [lah]
(um)
[ah] ya her maternity leave only starts I think in two months time
because she can still (err) go to work [lah] but her <malay>macam orang atas</malay> don't want her to come
to work as much because they know she's pregnant then the pandemic so
so that is which which I find it's pretty cool [lah] cause they really understands (uh) their employees
which is what we want to see in the workforce [ah] in the future we work
[ah] [ah] ya he's doing fine [lah] (um)
because he works at the port right so he helps (err) he is a I think I think he's an engineer then <malay>dia tolong macam pasang</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau ada</malay> any <malay>macam</malay> equipment <malay>yang rosak</malay>
so most of the time he will be there then if it rains they won't they won't activate him but if it doesn't rain
he'll be activated most of the time [lah] because ya you would you would expect
the equipments to fail you during (err) everyday day to day operations ya
(mm)
ya ya ya my my dad [ah] cause my dad quit before the pandemic thing started so
he was really unemployed [lah] beforehand so anything he you wanted to find a job but he couldn't because people were downsizing ya
so recently he managed to land a proper stable full time job so I I think he <malay>macam gembira</malay> [ah] like !wow! finally he get a job [ah]
cause he's been doing delivery at the site [ah] to to make to at least support my sister because my younger sister ya it's the only one that schooling right he need to pay for her food and
(err) [ah] school (err) <malay>apa tu yuran</malay> ya <malay>yuran sekolah</malay> unlike us [lah] for for
for me I at least I can work right then I can pay for myself so so side issue
(mm)
ya school fee is quite expensive
(mm) I think really does a good job [lah] in ensuring that (uh) local students don't pay a lot for the important
cause see ya twelve years the first twelve years (err) no first eight sixteen years of your life ya
until you at least get an O level [seh] ya
ya ya I did
ya four to five [ah]
(mm)
my sorry what
[oh] my girlfriend [ah] [oh] she's she's fine [lah] because [ah] she's graduating this year today is the virtual convocation actually
then ya she was telling me all about it [lah] how [ah] it's very interesting
then <malay>dia orang tayangkan</malay> the whole thing on (err) facebook live
so they will (err) how to say this they will
it would screen your names I think in terms of your school
so they will be like [oh] [ah] school of engineering <malay>dekat bawah</malay> [jer] <malay>nama-nama dia punya</malay> students ya in that slow
ya ya in that type of (uh)
effect ya format ya
[ah] facebook facebook live
then (uh) she that's for the general cohort then after that they have their own specific schools so for her (uh) school of (uh)
mathematics
(err) they had a zoom
so in that zoom session <malay>dia orang ada buat macam</malay> lucky draw [lah] so you can win prizes ya ya you can get like airpods (err) jabra elite mostly <malay>macam</malay> those school technology gadgets [lah]
ya <malay>dia lagi sikit menang</malay> [seh] she said (err) she said (err) the one that wins ya it's usually like either <malay>dua ke atas dua ke bawah</malay> so
what they found out from her name [ah]
ya
I mean [ah] aren't we all sore losers some days [ah]
[oh] (uh) it ended like I think two hours ago and after that she went
[ah] she went out [lah] with her family cause (err)
ya convocation ya but I forgot that
I actually ordered (err) ice cream <malay>untuk dia</malay> so like
ya then <malay>kat rumah</malay> I think got no one so (uh) ya I ordered ice cream for her graduation gift ya then I'm not sure [lah] cause the number is
[ah] the number I gave to the company is her number so I mean worst come to worst they will call her [lah] but they said they don't provide any dry ice so I'm hoping that <malay>dia balik sebelum</malay>
they deliver
ya the they call delivers from twelve to seven
so <malay>mana tahu</malay> [ah] got <malay>nasib</malay> [ah] time <malay>tujuh</malay> then <malay>baru hantar</malay>
I can request [lah] I mean the idea of contactless [kan] but
(uh) I I
I think that's the only choice I have but it'll it'll be terrible [lah] because the ice cream will be left out there the door and no one is there to pick it up

(mm) days were with him were the best [lah] because like you know me right I served
my as a firefighter ya and <malay>kita dulu masuk</malay> the station together together
so like both of us (um) kind of like spend our time there together [lah] from the start
cause you will from the academy also together and we went through our our final exam ya our trainings and when we were posted at the same station we were very happy [ah] <malay>kat</malay> #yishun# <malay>situ</malay>
the <malay>daerah</malay> canberra
so ya like when we were still freshies on the fire ground it was a bit scary [lah] because we don't know what to expect
meanwhile they told us in training is <malay>lain</malay> what from what you are going experience real life
ya but honestly the he is a really good good buddy [lah] to have when it comes to firefighting
ya
ya I'm I'm sure you have the same
experience when you what serving your time as the police right
what what what what you doing [ah] in police
[oh] [oh] so so you so you were like <malay>macam</malay> patrolman [lah] <malay>gitu ronda-ronda</malay> around the area
[ah]
the (err)
okay
[oh]
ya [lah]
!wah! they are not worrying [ah] like you I mean do you get calls often or <malay>macam takde masalah ke</malay> in the area
[oh] (err) I mean like since you are posted in a the area <malay>macam tak ramai orang</malay> [kan] so like aren't you like bored or something cause like do you get a lot of calls in that area
(um)
[oh]
understand [lah]
understand understand
ya I had I had a lot of fun in yes
<malay>macam tak</malay> pressure [lah] <malay>orang tak</malay> I don't feel <malay>macam orang</malay> bully you or anything
ya
[ah] <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
<malay>hibur-hiburkan</malay> [lah] so like it's successorize the the news man to them especially I mean if you're in there yourself you know how the culture works so
you know that it was just the that's a wrong day [lah] wrong time
(mm)
ya true true
ya well how you spend the rest of your day man
[oh] <malay>lari-lari anak</malay> around area
[ah]
but but usually <malay>berapa jauh</malay> you run
[oh]
ya correct [lah] I mean there's quite the huge distance [lah]
<malay>macam</malay> the only only time I ran <malay>jauh gitu</malay> is back when I was in serving my [lah] they make us run around #ubin#
(mm)
ya correct [lah] true true
[ah]
that's not bad
ya
and I think that's the way [lah] <malay>macam orang tak tahu</malay> you cannot drink a lot <malay>kalau nak minum sikit</malay> [jer] <malay>kalau boleh jangan minum</malay> at all
(uh) <malay>habis</malay>
thirty minutes <malay>baru</malay> [jer] <malay>minum</malay> that that's the ideology that
I don't know [lah] but that's what I see [lah]
[ah] <malay>macam</malay>
ya
I see [ah] is is you want it you want to drink just to quest [eh] quench your thirst but not to
(mm)
ya cause I I got I make [lah] this (err) module in back when I was in my first year university
ya it's about biology larh and then [oh] <malay>ada</malay> mention <malay>yang</malay> if you drink more during your exercise you are kind of
making your performance worse than if you
control your drinking [lah]
which is true [lah] ya cause they also mentioned that actually heatstroke [eh] no sorry not heatstroke on the heatstroke I think [ah] ya heatstroke ya heatstroke it's not because you don't drink too much
it's because
you know [eh]
ya
ya it it can be that and also you didn't <malay>ni</malay> [lah] (um) [ah] wash your body
because everybody have their own limit right so <malay>kita tak boleh kita tak boleh</malay> push too much [lah] <malay>nanti orang cakap</malay> [kan]
correct [lah] correct
(mm)
ya ya true
but okay [lah] I mean now at least the general public has the idea [lah] that
(mm)
K [lah]
ya
drinking
[oh] [ah] nah man I
I kind of stopped drinking [ah] so
how about you man
ya ya that's nice that's nice
I
apple juice [eh]
but ya <malay>berapa banyak</malay> juice you <malay>suka minum</malay> in one day <malay>selalu</malay>
[oh]
okay true [lah] because like for me <malay>macam</malay> I want to avoid drinking gassy drinks [kan] <malay>macam air air air yang</malay> sweet <malay>ni semua</malay>
<malay>boleh mendatangkan kencing manis</malay> so
ya so (uh) at home <malay>pun</malay> I only got <malay>air masak</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay> most of the time the only [ah] the best alternative would definitely be juices [ah]
so
I will go for orange juices and carrot juice but my favorite juice will be the
[ah] lime juice [ah]
[oh] no I don't like to buy all these <malay>macam</malay> manufactured <malay>punya</malay> cause I feel <malay>macam dia tak mendatangkan</malay> any
(err) well
<malay>apa tu</malay> benefit [lah] so I <malay>selalu beli pergi pasar</malay> then I <malay>beli dua tiga macam buah-buahan</malay>
[ah] <malay>biji biji buah-buahan</malay> then I <malay>balik</malay> I <malay>potong</malay> I blend
then I <malay>letak air</malay> then I <malay>minum</malay> [ah]
ya my
it's right way ya my <malay>ni</malay> if you if you if you if you got the time my <malay>ni</malay> always recommend [lah] when you blend [kan] you blend <malay>dengan dia punya kulit-kulit sekali</malay>
[ah] <malay>dengan kulit-kulit dia</malay> but the <malay>biji</malay> the <malay>biji</malay> you take out
okay [lah] the <malay>kulit</malay> (err)
how to say [ah] mine gonna like (err)
if you blend enough right the the whole drink will will come in well [lah] smooth
[oh] ya ya ya <malay>apa dia apa</malay> I heard some fruits [eh] if you don't
do it properly right it might be more harmful than good [lah] <malay>jadi kena macam pandai-pandai</malay> [lah]
(mm)

you know what I mean
ya
well it's only been a a few months [ah] since the start of the year
[ah]
ya [lah] as of now just chill [lah] just ya
occasional stuff
ya don't want to get my head too high
in the clouds
ya
(mm)
ya later you know my
potential <malay>nak kena</malay> backfire [ah] you know this kind of stuff so better to keep it <malay>macam</malay> tame first
ya
before it gets ya
ya pretty I pretty sure I already told
a handful of people only
[ah] including you
ya that's the thing
see
ya I've been wanting to
have this conversation quite awhile [lah]
I thought we could have played games you know during this (err) holiday period like like how he used to [lah] but
ya I guess this busy schedule
right I mean
furthermore <malay>kalau main</malay> also like
how many hours
and we don't have that kind of time [ah]
so
(mm)
so cannot play <malay>sampai lambat</malay> also [kan]

as a natural bass player I
I think I can handle
the the responsibilities of a lead guitarist [ah]
ya shouldn't be a problem [lah] but when is this [ah]
(um)
<malay>tak betul</malay> [ah] [ah] I know [ah]
ya that time [lor]
[oh] <malay>apa ni</malay>
<malay>baik</malay> [tau]
[oh]

probably four [oh]
together
[eh] but
I heard
if you want to go together then <malay>kena</malay> apply online [kan] to get the queue
[oh]
so should I apply like
like how long how much in advance can I apply now now can already [leh]
[orh]
[oh]
<malay>dia orang</malay> fast game [ah] [dah] apply online
ya but how's the slots like though
the best seats is <malay>tingkat berapa</malay>
[oh]
cause closer to god [kan]
(mm) so that means the the
<malay>takde yang rapatkan saf</malay> [lah]
<malay>kena</malay> expand
(mm)
do it [lah]
(mm)
I heard
the <malay>wuduk</malay> area now they <malay>dia orang taruh apa</malay> sanitizer
[oh] no [ah]
[oh] okay okay [oh] so they they
they close off the area [ah]
because then again it's a
to prevent the spread of
the water borne infections [ah]
(mm)
so then that means <malay>salam pun tak boleh</malay> [ah]
[ah] okay okay
the gentle gentle tap [lah] at the knuckles
speculation [lah]
situations ya
I mean
ya
<malay>orang</malay> only the <malay>orang atas</malay> would know [lah] all what is set in stone [lah]
ya
[oh]
yes
[oh]
suggestions [lah]
(mm) I would say I've only been out a few times for work and
ya I didn't get get to hang out with my friends like
on less than a handful of occasions
and that one <malay>pun</malay> mostly <malay>kat</malay> my
housing area
ya
ya so it's the same old <malay>kedai kopi</malay> and (err) you know the mall right ya
ya
ya the standard breakfast <malay>punya mee rebus mee siam nasi sambal goreng</malay>
ya
ya
ya that's why bro I've been meaning to on that [ah]
[oh] ya I did (err) the west ham versus watford right
[oh] my days so did you manage to watch like a bit of it or not at all
(mm)
[ah] okay okay ya I also thought I thought you would also do that <malay>macam dah</malay> second nature [kan] <malay>ambil wuduk</malay>
(um)
ya I mean
it's quite impressive [ah] that you've been a west ham fan for
twenty years [ah]
[oh] <malay>cik jamal</malay> [oh] I always thought he was
ya all this while right I thought he was like a nottingham forest <malay>punya</malay> supporter
[oh] at any pressure [lah]
(mm)
but ya [lah] I I think end of the day
jokes jokes is on him [lah] cause west ham
can't remain in the premier league right after that match
ya that's true that's true
I'm quite happy [sia] for you
ya on other hand
as for spurs right
ya
ya (mm) I would say they are doing fine now
but I'm just just stress [ah] bro for the last last two games [ah]
cause you <malay>punya</malay> opponent (mm)
ya correct correct
mid table but <malay>kalau menang</malay> the last two matches then
confirm qualify [ah] europa europa
ya champions league [dah]
<malay>dah tak boleh dah</malay>
a bit out of reach [ah] ya <malay>jauh sangat</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] so that's that [lah]
quite sad [lah] cause you know
we have a lot of quality players like sean sean playton [ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya that is expected of them [lah]
ya so
<malay>tu yang</malay> quite disappointing [ah]
but (uh) you know you know football just football [lah]
it just a game so
(mm)
ya
correct correct this [ah] can't be predicted [lah]
ya
but you know how prouds to liverpool
for securing that
(um) win [ah] so <malay>syabas</malay> to them
yes
(mm)
true true true
ya
[oh] ya speaking of liverpool right so how is (uh) your good our good friend [ah] #havi#
ya
[oh]
[oh] the usual springleaf or the #prata# place [ah]
(mm)
ya that's true that's true
!wah! so you'll be meeting him later [ah]
[oh] !wow!
ya
that's good that's good
ya just send him my [ah] regards [ah]
(err) like him to know that
I'm always happy for him [lah]
cause this is like first time in
<malay>dua puluh tahun</malay> is it ya liverpool won <malay>punya</malay> premier league
[ah] ya ya ya correct correct
yes yes
(uh) that's amazing
ya now he already ya [sia] he already almost thirty already
and ya so about time [ah]
[ah]
but I will have to say [ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> though he quite <malay>semangat</malay> [ah]
in supporting liverpool sometimes his tweets will be <malay>melampau</malay> [ah]
how emotion emotional football gets [ah]
(mm)
ya true true
but [oh] wells
is he is he still the regular <malay>kat</malay> your fire station
[oh] so what to to go into full time studies is it
does he does he say the requirement for like what do you call it [ah] the those that above twenty five year old
one of the scheme [oh] the
something to do with like mature mature student or something [eh]
[oh] james cook (mm)
[ah] okay okay
he but his passion nice [lah]
under him [mah]
(mm)
(mm)
trainings
(mm)
ya correct correct
(mm) no doubt [lah] he is really a <malay>budak baik</malay> [lah]
and (uh)
<malay>polis</malay>
ya
ya I was at (err) I was at the and #ang mo kio# over there ya
ya correct correct
<malay>biasa</malay> [ah] you know just
you know drive around the neighbourhood
(mm) do roundings only [ah]
ya but I would say I never
had like a close friend throughout the entire two years [ah]
cause no one from my from my my squad [ah] actually went to the same ya as me
ya so a bit <malay>sedih</malay> [ah]
cause they cause they base you based on your
where your where you stay your residence ya so ya so I <malay>kena</malay> posted <malay>kat</malay> foxtrot division [ah] <malay>tak banyak orang yang tinggal kat</malay> this area [ah]
sorry sorry can you repeat that again [ah]
(err) didn't get to hear clearly
(mm)
[oh] I would say there's a fair share of calls [lah] there's there's still ongoing back then [lah] (err) but I won't say it's as much as the those hot zones like <malay>macam</malay> woodlands #jurong#
ya I would say that central area quite tame [mah]
ya
but no doubt [lah] there's always calls here and there [lah] whether their severity <malay>macam</malay>
whether it's like (err) important or not [ah] it's a different thing
ya so that's how it was [ah]
ya but all in all
okay [lah] life
valuable [lah] ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya I I feel the same way [ah] as as much as like you know the <malay>berita dia orang</malay> cover and all these cases of
<malay>macam</malay> mismanagement
ya
I think it's isolated <malay>punya</malay> cases
cause
(mm)
ya correct correct
(mm)
true true
ya
cause <malay>biasanya macam</malay>
<malay>tak macam gitu</malay> [ah] usually it's more civilized and laid back [ah] I would say nothing much going on [ah]
ya
but [oh] well that's
it was a good times [ah] back in the days
ya
so ya man
I wish (err)
I wish I have plans after this [ah] but sadly I don't
(err) you know during the usual probably just go for a run
ya correct correct yes around
this (err) my vicinity [lah]
correct [ah]
[ah]
I usually go for a minimum ten [ah]
ya
you know ten run ya
I think I mean
[kan] <malay>kena</malay> stay active [kan]
ya
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
ya but I think is <malay>tak susah</malay> [ah] <malay>tak susah sangat</malay> [lah] but it's
<malay>kena biasakan</malay> so
ya I think if you were to consistently do it right it doesn't seem like a very long distance ya
(mm) cause when you when you first start [lah] like after one ten and then usually you <malay>togok air</malay> like <malay>melampau</malay> [ah] but
now I barely need a sip of water [ah]
ya
ya correct
(mm)
ya
ya correct correct correct I that one I fully agree [ah] [kan] I mean cause <malay>banyak orang banyak orang tak</malay>
<malay>tak begitu</malay> informed [lah] about this kind of stuff [ah] so
<malay>macam</malay>
the
it is the right way [lah] is to <malay>jangan minum banyak</malay> [ah] you have to conserve
cause if you drink too much then later your system
like <malay>macam</malay>
it's it's it's hampered with already [ah] so you need to stay stay clean [ah]
ya
ya but but not to you know pamper it until to to make it seem as if like you have to go full
<malay>kena</malay> full cool down mode already [ah]
it's just
you know quench a bit
skip
(mm)
ya correct correct
heatstroke [ah] heatstroke
no it's not it's not cause you drink to little [lah] it's cause you you <malay>minum melampau</malay> [ah] basically
(mm)
correct correct
[ah] that's true [lah] cause <malay>kalau kau minum banyak</malay> [kan] the you're over dependence on water is the thing that will make
you more vulnerable to heatstroke [lah]
ya cause the more you run then like the more you are without that amount of water then confirm
<malay>kau punya badan</malay> is like you know get gets in a shock
(uh) so the more you <malay>biasakan</malay> with more water then the more likely you will
<malay>kenakan</malay> the effects of that heatstroke [ah]
[kan]
<malay>ni semua kena belajar</malay> [ah]
(mm) <malay>yang tepat</malay> [ah]
to combat this kind stuff
speaking of drinking right so how have you been
you've been drinking you know
(mm)
ya
well
(uh) I haven't been a fan of you know alcoholic beverages [ah] but I've been (uh)
(err) a good a very good consumer of like (err) juices
ya like apple juice
orange juice [ah] yes you as you as you saying
(uh) I would say at least
two bottles [lah]
two bottles (err) five hundred kind [ah]
of juices ya correct
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
yes yes yes correct correct
ya
[ah] okay but where do you get this where what what what what brand are your juices
benefits [ah]
(mm)
[oh] the <malay>biji</malay> [ah] <malay>biji</malay>
<malay>biji-biji kecil</malay> [ah]
!wah!
!wah! that's
I think that's (err) that's the right way to go [ah] to be honest
[ah]
[oh] serious
then
the <malay>biji</malay> take out then you blend the <malay>kulit</malay> but but then
<malay>bila kau minum</malay> [kan]
then is the texture smooth
<malay>kalau</malay>
[oh] do you blend the <malay>kulit</malay> [ah]
ya ya correct correct then I think I read somewhere that if you blend the the fiber
it will be drinkable [lah] but
you need to use a
good blender [lah]
ya I would say that [lah]
ya
but <malay>kau kena</malay>
<malay>kau kena</malay> like see first [lah] whether this the the type of fruit
already has natural sugars [ah] before <malay>kau tambah</malay> extra sugar or anything [lah] when you blend
[ah]
(mm) true true ya
that's why I would suggest
but
some fruits like oranges apples actually those
with the sugar level already <malay>dah cukup</malay> already
<malay>tak payah tambah</malay> extra stuff
(um)
but as for
(err) grapefruit
(uh) those kind of stuff that one maybe add a bit [ah]
ya
so be smooth [ah]
sorry grape
[ah] <malay>lain</malay>
ya different different
(err) grapefruit is <malay>besar sikit</malay>
ya grape is just small smaller version of grapefruit
<malay>sama sama</malay> ya
ya it's (uh) <malay>pelik</malay> [sia]
<malay>nama sama tapi</malay>
different size ya
ya that's why the best is to
drink coconut [ah]
(mm)
ya but <malay>kau kena potong</malay> [ah] before you put <malay>dalam</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> blender

(um) very thick

[eh] it doesn't make sense [leh] I mean like okay like <malay>kau tahu</malay> (uh)
like FatBoy's and FatPapas
that [one] is like they have similar menu but they open one cause they want to make a halal version
but then in this case like <malay>abang gemuk</malay> and Fatty Bom Bom no difference [what] both halal already [what]
so like they <malay>tukar nama</malay> for what [sia]
ya that's why
cause usually franchise is people
they want to make use of the name [mah] it doesn't make sense for you to franchise
but then you change the name
don't know [ah]
but
that time also <malay>ada</malay> [ah]
so like like when I go #lia's# house <malay>senang</malay> [ah]
like if got feels for Fatty Bom Bom [ah] it's just like
think like if we Grab like twenty minutes <malay>sampai</malay> [ah]
no no no it's not at #afghan# there it's at
(uh) <malay>kau tahu</malay> #dunman# sec <malay>kat mana</malay>
ya it's opposite #dunman# sec [ah]
then #lia# my my girlfriend's house is like one stop away from there
[ah] <malay>dekat</malay> [ah]
<malay>malas</malay> [pe] <malay>dah cakap malas nak</malay> exercise
like really like it's it's like
it's like walking distance but it's a walking distance <malay>yang jauh</malay> it's like
#yio chu kang# to your house like that
like
ya okay wait actually actually not that far [ah]
may half half the journey [ah] from #yio chu kang# to your house
ya but like <malay>macam</malay>
if you at the comfort of a house already you watching
watching television all already like
confirm <malay>malas</malay> [sia] <malay>nak keluar</malay> it's easier for you to just order
then they deliver straight to your door step
ya three four dollars [ah]
the
(uh) #tampines# [one] not so bad [eh]
I know
usually me and #lia# buy
two people
later with the discount code at last pay like twelve dollars fourteen dollars
ya
but that [one] <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay>
if only <malay>kalau ada</malay> discount [ah]
usually I get the
cajun cajun [eh] cajun cajun chicken [ah]
the cajun chicken with rice
like the spaghetti the spaghetti not bad but like
I think I prefer rice [ah] the rice is they
garlic rice garlic butter rice like that
(uh) then then got the then got the <malay>telur</malay> so it's like more like fried rice like that [lah]
but it goes very well with the sauce and the chicken [ah]
I never try <malay>abang gemuk</malay> before [ah] so cannot say [ah]
Fatty Bom Bom or FatBoy's
ya
depends [ah] some
you know some of the hawker centre [ah]
the western shop got like secondary school feels [ah]
#Idah's# Kitchen
I don't remember [sia]
is it the one the the thai shop take over [ah]
the last stretch
last stretch near the drink stall
[oh] [oh] [oh]
I that [one] I thought that [one] is korean food [what]
[oh] I don't think I ate there before [ah]
now they got new [one] [ah] at Koufu
but a bit <malay>mahal</malay> [ah] that day I eat it's like six ninety
that kind of price [ah]
(uh) the
the whole range [ah] like you know chicken chop (uh)
the
hawaiian grill
all that kind of time
all that kind of stuff [ah]
<malay>tapi macam</malay>
even though six ninety seven ninety still
that thing worth it [ah]
<malay>pasal dorang</malay> <malay>dorang bagi banyak</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak tapi</malay> even though the portion worth [kan] but I feel like it's like two people portion [ah]
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> the rice you know rice usually they don't give full bowl right do they give full bowl
usually they give like half bowl like that right
but over there they give the full bowl [ah] then the <malay>ayam pun dorang bagi dua</malay>
Koufu you know where the (uh)
is the last shop but it's the same side as the japanese side
ya
I think new [ah] the shop <malay>dulu takde</malay> [ah]
but I not too sure [ah] maybe
I don't really remember [ah] because usually <malay>dulu kita orang makan sana</malay>
always <malay>makan</malay> the
japanese shop [kan]
[eh]
how [lah] I want to get better at DOTA [sia]
no [eh] but I play
I play public game like <malay>macam</malay>
always <malay>kena</malay> thrashed [ah]
it's like
if I get toxic opponent [eh] like if my teammate is terrible right the opponent would be somehow good [ah]
maybe [ah] maybe also
but I don't know [ah]
then <malay>aku tunggu kau</malay> download warzone <malay>sampai sekarang belum</malay> download
<malay>kental</malay> [lah]
I don't know [eh] like
I don't know how come your computer <malay>semua</malay> games <malay>tak boleh</malay> [sia]
like
the #genshin# impact also cannot right
but okay [ah] nevermind [ah] because #genshin# like you can't really play with friends [ah] like got co-op mode
but it's not really
it's not
ya it's not ya the main part the game play is not revolving around
co-op mode [ah]
like it's more to like <malay>main sendiri</malay>
then you just explore the world yourself [ah]
then
<malay>apa</malay>
I mean like now I toned down I don't play as much anymore [ah]
like cause <malay>dorang ada macam</malay> like a energy system like that
like the call it resin
so
you know [ah] so like (uh) this resin right if you want to do a dungeon
you need to use like let's say twenty resin
then let's say you got hundred twenty you use twenty means you got hundred left
but then the this resin will recharge [ah] like I think it's like four minutes to charge one resin
or
so it's like once you used all your resin already you got nothing else to do
so
the resin you cannot you need to wait for time to go by [lor] then it recharge slowly
then <malay>kau boleh buat</malay> the stuff you need to do [ah]
so it's mostly a waiting game [ah] like you finish
you finish what you need to do already then just <malay>tunggu</malay> [ah]
I don't know [sia] I see online people mostly say it will die down right
cause of
how limited your game play is
like like really the game play is
fantastic [ah] phenomenal
but
I would say [ah] M I've play [ah] so far
<malay>tapi</malay>
better than runescape [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
it's just that you're limited like there's so many things to do
but because of the resin you only can
like <malay>kau kena tunggu</malay> [ah] resin <malay>kau</malay> fill up <malay>baru kau boleh main</malay>
ya so it's more of a waiting game [ah] so like as much as I want to do a lot of things I cannot
I think maybe that's their way of like getting people to play it long term [ah]
ya true [ah]
[oh]
console <malay>pun ada</malay>
<malay>ada</malay>
ya like I saw on YouTube got the whales [ah] they spent <malay>banyak</malay> [ah]
dude <malay>gila</malay> like okay the people that whale right they spent the first week the game came out
they spent like
like <malay>empat ribu lima ribu</malay>
ya so like they and even then right they don't have the
like got this guy spent four thousand dollars
he still don't have all the hero
so it's like really luck based [ah] <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] your luck <malay>macam mana</malay>
I think maple [ah] cause this [one] is very easy to free-to-play
like like so far for me I never spend money but I'm still
quite far in the game already [ah]
like I I complete all the story mode already
<malay>pernah pernah</malay> [ah] [ah] last time I buy the skin
ya ya ya it's like DOTA like that [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> I bought their equivalent of the battle pass
I think I paid like <malay>lima belas</malay> [eh]
fifteen then
so I just complete the tale like until the max then I get the skill already
then after that I don't spend money already [ah] like
wasteful [ah] spend <malay>duit kat</malay> game
ya some more it's like
<malay>ada</malay> [ah] additional stats but the additional stats is like what plus eight damage
like
it it makes a difference but like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak leh nampak sangat</malay> [ah] like you need like
an advantage is advantage [ah] but like they make it minimal [lor]
so <malay>tak rasa sangat</malay>
(uh) (uh) <malay>kau macam tak</malay> you like don't know me like that [ah]
since when I even watch soccer
(hmm) <malay>sejak bila</malay>
<malay>sejak bila aku tengok bola</malay>
I don't know [ah] like
I never I've never seen the the
what's the word [eh] the
the attractiveness of watching soccer [ah] like it's just
so slow
like <malay>kau</malay> compare <malay>dengan</malay> basketball basketball like very fast paced so like
so see a lot of action for forty five minutes like that
[a'ah] <malay>tapi tapi bola macam</malay>
you wait pass pass pass I don't know [ah] maybe just not my thing [ah] I guess
<malay>diam sudah</malay>
[eh]
tomorrow tomorrow I got no school [ah]
like I book my <malay>solat jumaat tak dapat</malay>
<malay>dah lama</malay> [sia]
wanted to book [ah]
<malay>tapi tak dapat</malay> [ah]
(mm)
since the booking start I never I never <malay>kena dapat</malay> I think cause I always book late [ah]
so <malay>dah semua</malay> all the slots <malay>dah</malay> fill up [kan] then <malay>dah tak boleh</malay>
<malay>dah tak boleh dapat</malay> slot [ah]
I really not sure [sia]
I think the same week [ah] on monday I think the thing open
it's first come first serve
but if you already did it like within
I think now is five weeks [ah]
or four weeks I not sure
so like let's say I do today already right
[eh] I do tomorrow already
then (uh) <malay>aku tak leh buat</malay> for the next five weeks
[a'ah] so other people can get [ah] but some more <malay>aku selalu tak dapat</malay> [ah]
it
[eh] I think they blacklist me already
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak nak</malay> [ah]
<malay>tengok kerusi</malay> all
where you where you (uh) where you plan on getting
APOL
(uh huh) I only know I only know Secret Lab [ah]
(uh) and streamers (uh) <malay>aku tengok</malay> mostly streamers <malay>pakai</malay> the <malay>ini</malay> [ah] Secret Lab [one]
but then the pricing [eh] similar [ah]
<malay>paling murah</malay>
<malay>asal mahal sangat</malay> [sia] it's just a chair right
like
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi tapi</malay> even though
<malay>aku bayar banyak-banyak</malay>
but
I'm not getting the premium like it's not you said it yourself [what] like it's not genuine leather right
it's leather you know leather actually <malay>murah</malay> [seh]
[ah]
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
(uh) five hundred dollars on a chair
<malay>kerusi</malay>
(uh huh)
I mean you you said it yourself right like <malay>dorang apa</malay> similar [kan]
!huh!
worth it [ah] got you can take it like it's like you buy
you buy laptop in poly
you top up hundred dollars you get three years warranty on site [what]
<malay>sama</malay> [ah]
I mean okay warranty <malay>dia</malay> is <malay>apa</malay> one for one exchange or what
<malay>macam tak masuk akal</malay> right like
<malay>ada koyak sikit</malay>
then then they what they sew it up or what they cannot change
ya I think this [one] must ask [ah] I think if
if really one for one exchange worth it [ah]
every other week
<malay>kau ambil pisau kau potong</malay> [seh] already
[oh] really [ah]
okay how about <malay>macam kalau air tumpah</malay>
<malay>air tumpah</malay> on the thing
is it considered like
damage with intent or is it like accident
but
okay but
okay but what if it's like <malay>kau tumpah</malay> [kan] Coke
like you know Coke is very very corrosive right
that time that time <malay>siapa</malay> [eh] <malay>tunjuk aku</malay> (uh) I think
#achap# [ah] #achap# <malay>tunjuk aku</malay> the video
<malay>orang pakai</malay> Coke
<malay>untuk cuci</malay> toilet
ya exactly then people are putting that that stuff into their mouth you know and into their system
ya I also
I've never been a fan of fizzy drinks [ah] like even time <malay>hari raya</malay> [kan]
like
(uh) okay usually guest just [eh] (uh) <malay>tuan rumah dorang selalu</malay> just <malay>tuang</malay> [kan]
F&N [pe] F&N is like the standard [ah] the (mm)
my my <malay>nenek punya</malay> side more of Coke [ah] so they got like
they got like a lot of Coke
like one one what do you call that [eh] (uh) basket
not basket [ah] they got like one they got one but container full of Coke
then another container is all just (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> F&N
ya <malay>hari raya</malay>
so if I go my <malay>nenek</malay> house
it's really just gassy drinks <malay>atau teh</malay>
so for me I'm more like ice lemon tea
like you know Pokka ice lemon tea <malay>gitu</malay>
ya different
syrup also not a big fan [ah]
I think more of like bottled drinks that
that's like established [ah]
like Pokka Seasons
Seasons (uh) (uh) the ice lemon tea is the blue colour [one] but they got the
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] the other one <malay>yang</malay> [ah] the <malay>hijau</malay> [one] the <malay>hijau</malay> [one] <malay>sedap</malay> [ah]
it's
ice ice lemon green tea
ya ya you can taste the tea [ah] but the blue colour [one] is mostly you taste the
lemon and the sweetness [ah] ya the sugar
<malay>tak tapi</malay> the best [one] I think is the Seasons peach tea
Seasons peach tea but <malay>susah</malay> [ah] <malay>nak cari</malay> like everywhere I go like most most <malay>kedai tak jual</malay> [ah]
I don't know why
Seasons not Pokka
it confirm <malay>pernah</malay> it's the orange colour [one]
but <malay>sekarang susah nak cari</malay> I think they stopped production already [ah] I haven't I haven't seen it
for for a while already [ah]
[eh] [a'ah] [eh] (uh)
wait from where
wait I still looking for a job [ah] dude
<malay>takde takde</malay> <malay>takde kerja takde gaji takde gaji takde duit</malay>
<malay>takde duit takde</malay> table tennis
I think no more already confirm <malay>dorang dah buang punya</malay> like the thing so #lup sup# you know
haven't [ah] but I heard they going to open already
so I don't know [ah] I just scared
<malay>macam</malay> repeat
like history repeat repeat itself [ah]
(uh) ya that's why
then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> not that bad because like
my friends all
my friends all is really
eighteen year old nineteen year old
so there's always that generation gap
so like I think I'm not able to
to bond with them as much [ah]
so maybe not that bad [ah]
but then [eh] you got #lobang# for <malay>kerja</malay> or not
ya but like
I don't know [ah] like I want to do cafe all but like the cafe all <malay>semua yang tak</malay> halal
in the one that pays well [ah]
ya ya nine dollars is okay
or banquet [ah]
okay [ah] honestly [ah]
<malay>aku tak pernah kerja</malay> banquet
that time you work [what] no [meh]
<malay>yang sebelah yang sebelah</malay> Hard Rock Cafe
[ah]
(uh)
[oh]
#sheikh# also work kitchen [ah]
[oh]
the one a
[eh] but that [one] also see your manager also [ah]
because
ya cause (uh) my friend from <malay>dulu kerja</malay>
it's not really banquet [ah] but they set up for the banquet people [ah]
<malay>kat</malay>
#shang# Shangri-La
ya so what what they do is they just set up the place
(uh) like the table chair stage <malay>semua dorang</malay> set up
then usually it's for like reception <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] wedding reception kind of thing
ya then after that they just <malay>tunggu</malay> for the event to finish then they teardown
I think so like who
[oh] yeah yeah yeah but
but <malay>dorang punya</malay> is more for <malay>ini</malay> [kan] is like
like <malay>apa ni</malay> concerts <malay>semua</malay> [kan]
[ah] ya then this [one] is only for
like wedding reception only [ah]
<malay>kat</malay> Shangri-La that that type
ya so but then cause he make friends with the manager [ah] so
the manager is like #sheikh# and that [one] also
(uh) like
like to pass on the responsibility to someone
so he pass on the responsibility to my friend
so my friend from casual labour becomes a manager
but you get casual labour pay [lah]
but cause of the manager position he's not doing much [ah]
he just delegate the work <malay>semua</malay> then <malay>duduk goyang kaki goyang</malay> [ah]
ya
ya
then I don't know [ah] I think everywhere you go I think as long as you make friends [eh]
<malay>kerja senang</malay> [ah] <malay>tak yah buat banyak sangat</malay> [ah]
[oh] ya but Marche <malay>tak</malay> halal [lah]
[eh] <malay>jangan gini</malay> [ah]
(uh)
maybe
[eh] have you have you went to Fika before
ya [eh] the food there
ya it's it's
you know where working title is [eh] actually working title closed already it's beside working title [ah]
!huh! they work there
I cannot imagine #rian# at Fika though cause the people there are like really
<malay>berbual</malay> really like proper english <malay>punya</malay> you know and like
how to say [ah] I don't know [ah] I can't imagine #rian# there
like #aidil# #aidil# I still can see him [ah] working at Fika but #rian# a bit hard [ah] to imagine him working there
[eh] but the food there the food
the [eh] the ambiance all
top notch [ah]
like work there also I think #swee#
[eh] the food
a bit more to the <malay>mahal</malay> side [ah]
[oh] I I never try Malayan Council before like
ya a lot people ask me try because they say the food there good
cause (uh) my friend tell me their service there is like top notch [ah]
but then my friend say [ah] like even though like
okay my friend went there for the first date
then <malay>dia dapat banyak apa ni</malay>
(uh) <malay>banyak</malay> freebies <malay>semua</malay>
but then <malay>dia kira balik</malay> [kan] actually what he paid for
like at a normal cafe that's what he will get [ah]
worth it [lah] ya
but then voucher means you need to come back there and spend [ah]
[oh]

apex apex game <malay>dia macam mana</malay>
<malay>tapi dia punya</malay> graphics <malay>semua macam</malay> cartoon-ish [kan]
cartoon-ish is like what like like team fortress [ah]
valorant is not [sia] actually it's quite realistic [what] is like same as almost go but
only the suit like a bit
[oh] (uh) <malay>kira</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> halo kind of graphic [ah]
[eh] how
are you are you buying the five or not
busy <malay>dengan sekolah</malay>
<malay>tapi sekarang</malay> five <malay>berapa</malay>
is now is <malay>mahal</malay> cause <malay>orang</malay> resell [eh]
[oh]
I don't know [ah] like <malay>semua orang</malay> like <malay>rebut nak beli</malay> P [eh] actually not ya I don't know I never see the hype of console [lah]
<malay>ada</malay> [ah] <malay>main</malay> [ah]
like when I go to my <malay>apa ni</malay> cousin's house
(uh)
ya like the first console I owned was
(ugh) cause okay
<malay>aku dari dulu</malay> [kan] like
when I growing up like I never had all these things cause
my parents <malay>macam</malay>
so like
want me to concentrate on studies kind of thing [ah]
so
like
I didn't have much distraction other than computer
but computer <malay>pun</malay> my parents let me play like what twenty minutes
ya so
<malay>dorang</malay> like <malay>cakap</malay> okay (uh) #haris# (uh)
<malay>kau main</malay> twenty minutes
then after that [eh] you need to finish assessment book first then you can play for twenty minutes
so it's like a reward kind of thing
so
so I only got my first console after my
[eh] [eh] no primary five exam primary five exam I got all A
ya then my
my father [ah] my father <malay>cakap</malay> like [eh] #haris# (uh) okay [ah]
they never even tell me you know cause I always tell them I want game boy I want game boy
not really strike a deal [lah] like they just said okay if you do well for your exam we'll get you a game boy
but they say that since primary three [ah] so like I never really believe them [ah]
(uh) wouldn't say well [lah] like
so so [ah] A A B B
like A B B B
like I would say it's okay [ah] above average [ah] slightly above average
but then
I think primary five I don't know [ah] one day I just come home [eh]
suddenly like everyone <malay>kat</malay> (uh) <malay>kat luar</malay> then I was like thinking what you doing then they were charging the
then turns out one was for me [ah] one was for my sister
ya
ya my sister was the one that wanted I wanted game boy [what]
so my father <malay>cakap dengan</malay> the salesperson the salespersons <malay>cakap like</malay>
[eh] <malay>cik</malay> if you want to buy game boy
your son will get sick of it very fast
ya dying already
no [ah] but wasted [ah] cause my parents bought when it first came out
so it's one thousand
[ah]
<malay>dah</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tak yah panggil gemuk</malay> [pe]
[ah] ya so
like
I think a few months after I got my the slim [one] come out
the once the slim [one] come out <malay>semua beli</malay> [ah]
ya
but then that the closest to console I got [ah]
ya but actually the games there quite good [sia]
ya
[ah]
I think take over [ah] the market
Vita Vita Vita ya ya ya
downfall [lah] ya
then I
but I
I think
I think it's cause it's different [lah] like you don't really have any console yang <malay>kau boleh</malay> use touch screen <malay>kat bawah tapi</malay> still got the tactile buttons
ya it's like
just want to show off features [ah] <malay>ada</malay> dual screen kind of
[ah] that [one] is a Pokemon brand already [ah]
until now right ya Switch
no but Switch still got <malay>ada ada</malay> animal crossing <malay>ada</malay>
got other games [ah]
but quite popular [what] <malay>aku tengok banyak orang</malay> [sia] <malay>main</malay>
ya don't know [ah]
maybe if we play it then maybe we also get hooked [ah] don't know [ah] this kind of thing
you know joe biden
he he also play animal crossing [ah]
ya
the (uh) he got post on Twitter [ah] I got see a picture of his (uh) like office like that
I think
publicity [ah] like you want to be relatable
ya that's what
all all politicians like that [what]
got a
probably that [one] also not he play [ah] maybe his team play for him [ah]
ya
!hais!
<malay>tak pernah</malay> [ah]
[oh] okay okay <malay>faham faham</malay> ya
but some like okay but some cartoon-ish graphic is nice [leh]
like I okay this [one] is a very indie game
like last time my sister buy from popular [ah]
until now I I looking to play it again you know but <malay>tak [leh] jumpa</malay> [ah] it's called what is it called [eh] (uh)
adventurer concourse I forget [ah]
it is [ah] it's like you build you build a town like that then you hire hero
(uh) medieval conquest yes that's a game
medieval conquest
no no no no it's one by itself [ah]
but quite fun and quite challenging also
total war <malay>tak pernah</malay> [ah]
total war is what [ah]
is it
[oh] no no no
ya <malay>apa</malay> [eh] got once got one game quite sick it was on Steam bro <malay>yang</malay>
ya you you are on the planet
then you can choose two sides
so every player we choose one side got two sides to choose from [lah]
so basically the side you choose from
it's like basically imagine counter-strike
but it's ongoing the game is always ongoing
so I forget [ah] (uh)
I !wah! I forgot what's the name of the game but basically what how you supposed to win right
is you are supposed to advance your unit
through to the other side [ah]
but cause the game is so massive right
like the frontline rarely move
but it's cool cause like
let's say you got ten friends
<malay>korang boleh</malay> like form a squad then do like
tactics to go to the other side you know then like
do missions to like
sabotage the other side
(err) (uh) quite cool [ah]
I forgot what's the name of the game [ah]
<malay>apa</malay> [ah] <malay>nama dia</malay>
plazma burst
(mm)
isn't that just (uh)
escape room
[oh] [oh] is it is it the one <malay>yang kau kena kena</malay> fix the generators <malay>semua</malay>
and then there's a ghost chasing you
[oh] is it
I'm not sure [ah]
#farid# all [ah]
skipper
#aiman#
#aiman#
[oh] I don't know [ah] I never see [ah] they post on twitter [ah]
I never see before [ah] #ipin# I only see him post <malay>punya</malay> video [ah]
okay [lah] not bad [lah] he was top top in singapore [ah] one point of time
for one hero no cause in is as long as you play a hero <malay>banyak-banyak</malay> [kan]
then your
for that hero will increase
[ah] so like (uh) he play this hero I think he just keep playing the same hero over and over again [ah]
so his score is higher than everyone else so he was like top seven in singapore [ah]
for me the best I got was top thirteen for north side
and no no no north singapore region means woodlands #yishun# ya
I they don't have singaporean server I don't know
I think it's (uh) asian server [ah]
but they got they got a location service
so for singapore is easy singapore is divided into four places are north south east west
so <malay>kalau kau nak</malay> clamp the ranking <malay>kena main banyak</malay> [ah]
so after you get like let's say you top of north already
then you I think once you hit a certain position then they will put you as laptop in singapore
ya
ya for other country is by state so like #johor# <malay>macam</malay> #johor# will be
under it will be malaysia but then under malaysia got top in #johor# top in #selangor# top in #sabah# that kind of thing
ya that's why
I think north south east west also like cause a lot of players so they need to <malay>macam</malay> separate <malay>semua orang</malay>
singapore is one state [ah] singapore is a state [what] it's a state country right
(uh)
out outdate outdated information [ah] that [one]
okay I can say also [lah]
!hais!

<malay>aku</malay> kind of <malay>tengah</malay>
(uh) basically
<malay>tak ada tak ada</malay> majority things <malay>yang</malay> come to <malay>aku punya</malay> (err) <malay>aku punya</malay> life
(err)
I've now <malay>baru</malay> start <malay>main</malay> bicycle (err) <malay>aku baru beli</malay> bicycle (err) a cruiser

<malay>aku</malay> been doing a lot of (err) things <malay>kat</malay>
(err) studio
(um)
<malay>aku rasa</malay>
(err) nothing fantastic <malay>yang aku rasa tengah</malay> going on
which is (err) [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>aku rasa tenang</malay> [ah] <malay>macam biasa</malay> [ah]
<malay>tenang</malay> [ah] so more more of and more more upcoming projects
<malay>yang akan kami</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay>
(err)
but <malay>paling</malay> boring is (err) <malay>tak dapat pergi</malay> (err) <malay>seberang tambak</malay> [ah]
<malay>itu yang paling</malay> boring [ah] <malay>pada aku</malay> for the past six months <malay>ini</malay>
ya
<malay>sebab</malay> member member <malay>yang kat sana semua tengah tunggu aku juga</malay>
so ya
<malay>bila kau nak ikut</malay>
!huh!
[ah]
[ah] <malay>aku</malay> suppose I think (err) I think (err) <malay>dia bukan</malay>
[ah] maybe maybe <malay>betul pada kau macam</malay> in thing <malay>sebab semua orang</malay>
but the point is <malay>sebab tak ada</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay> activity <malay>yang tak boleh keluar negeri jadi</malay>
that is the whole why everybody was into that and the thing is <malay>juga</malay>
it's the best time <malay>untuk nak</malay> explore and then <malay>kita</malay> are much more older right now
I guess it's the exploration <malay>yang</malay>
it will stop <malay>orang kata macam</malay>
<malay>kalau dulu lepas sekolah</malay>
I mean time <malay>sekolah kita</malay> [kan] <malay>dulu</malay> explore <malay>kat bawah</malay> block <malay>lepas itu pergi jauh-jauh</malay>
<malay>lepas itu mungkin ada orang</malay>
(err) <malay>main</malay>
<malay>main tangkap</malay> spider at some point of time [kan] <malay>kita orang dah malas buat benda ni</malay> because kita nak kerja</malay>
so when <malay>kita dah kerja</malay> probably <malay>kita jumpa</malay> somebody
(err) <malay>bila</malay> (mm) <malay>jumpa kawan</malay>
[ah] nonsense <malay>buat</malay> nonsense nonsense <malay>punya barang</malay> then
<malay>aku rasa</malay> at this point of time <malay>pasal kita orang kena</malay>
<malay>tersekat dekat negeri</malay>
<malay>jadi mungkin aku rasa</malay> that's the best time <malay>untuk</malay> (um) <malay>beriadah</malay> [ah]
<malay>untuk</malay> just do leisure out of
<malay>kau punya</malay> own comfort zone <malay>jadi</malay> this is the best time <malay>untuk kau</malay> come back to <malay>kau punya</malay>
(err) youth <malay>balik ke</malay>
you know where <malay>kau kau</malay> missing out
[ah] and <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's a good good good thing <malay>juga</malay> with this (um)
with this (err) pandemic because
<malay>aku rasa kita</malay> will tend to <malay>macam tahu yang dekat negeri kita</malay> itself
<malay>ada</malay> this <malay>tempat ada</malay> that <malay>tempat ada</malay>
then <malay>kita pun tahu yang macam</malay> okay <malay>kita sudah tak tahu apa nak buat</malay> right now apart from just <malay>makan</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> start to do cycling will start to explore <malay>macam</malay>
(um) <malay>tempat-tempat yang kita tak pernah pergi</malay> before
[ah] so <malay>aku rasa</malay>
it's good <malay>juga</malay> [ah]
but (err) <malay>kalau kau cakap</malay> about that is the the the in thing right now
probably ya probably
but not just aku rasa ada orang pun buat</malay> not just (err) cycling <malay>tahu</malay>
some people go to macritchie I mean we we've seen that before
but randomly but now is <malay>macam semua orang dah</malay> start to <malay>macam</malay> even
(uh) explore our own country <malay>punya</malay> whatever <malay>yang ada kat dalam</malay> [ah] not just <malay>bab makan</malay> [jer]
<malay>apasal kau tak nak main basikal</malay>
ya I mean <malay>yang kalau kau cakap pasal longkang</malay> it's definitely
at this point of time <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>semua orang nak masuk longkang</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>semua orang nak masuk longkang tapi</malay>
but if there if there are thing <malay>macam tu aku rasa</malay> there will be possibilities <malay>pun pasal</malay>
<malay>pasal</malay> it's not <malay>macam</malay> something <malay>yang apa</malay>
something <malay>yang</malay> (err)

[kan] that first few weeks [kan] at least a month <malay>tak keluar</malay> [kan]
so this phase two <malay>yang</malay> that one month <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>yang kedai-kedai gunting pun</malay>
ya [kan]
ya circuit breaker
like I think we were talking about circuit breaker itself
phase one was later on
yes and then <malay>ada</malay> phase two right
ya so this was <malay>macam</malay> the first
first few days <malay>yang</malay> when <malay>dia orang</malay> announce <malay>tak boleh keluar</malay>
[ah]
okay [ah] (err)
[ah] <malay>aku</malay> was having so much (err) <malay>banyak banyak</malay> (um)
kind of <malay>macam</malay> (err) slowly slowly became <malay>macam</malay>
spending [sia]
<malay>dalam diam aku</malay> did a lot of shopping you know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> online shopping which is <malay>aku</malay> never that did did that before [ah] but I really did [ah]
and then ya it was really <malay>macam</malay>
like any other day any other day it was just <malay>macam</malay> two dollar <malay>punya</malay> shopee
three dollar <malay>punya</malay> stuff and then every
like every two three days <malay>mesti ada barang datang kat rumah aku</malay> [eh]
but ya [lah] it was really funny that <malay>aku</malay> (err) <malay>ada</malay> that phase [ah]
because <malay>aku rasa tak semua orang tak tahu apa nak buat</malay> [eh]
(mm) I mean being <malay>apa yang engkau nak buat</malay>
and then <malay>kita orang tak ada</malay> that that that that
<malay>tanah lapang</malay> you know we don't have a big (um)
big land to
to play around to to run around
[ah]
<malay>kalau kau nak pergi luar</malay> to check people out <malay>pun macam</malay>
and the road was empty the whole street was lonely
[ah]
<malay>aku rasa</malay> that that experience was really <malay>macam</malay> best <malay>untuk aku</malay> [ah]
and then because <malay>aku pun ada</malay> at some point of time
(err) during that circuit time <malay>pun aku hantar</malay>
<malay>aku punya aku punya</malay> senior <malay>aku punya</malay> dad <malay>dekat hospital jadi</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> saw how the street are lonely
till it go into phase one
and then yes
phase one is when everybody <malay>macam</malay> really <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>sudah</malay> come back to <malay>macam</malay> you know
(um) lively [ah]
[ah]
I think <malay>yang dah boleh pergi makan dekat luar kedai-kedai dah banyak buka</malay>
[ah]
but ya
but I think during (err)
during (err) <malay>apa</malay> (err)
during (err) circuit breaker <malay>punya</malay> time <malay>pun</malay> I think (um)
I did walk around [lah] <malay>macam pergi</malay> mcdonald's then
come back and walk and then I saw the whole thing [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
!wow!
it was really <malay>macam</malay> almost to
almost to <malay>macam</malay>
being in the eighties <malay>balik</malay> where there is not much people around
(err)
but at the same time <malay>pun macam</malay> lonely <malay>juga</malay>
[ah]
ya
ya
I think it's okay if we are younger
because <malay>kita pun</malay> will be hide inside
you know <malay>macam</malay> it's okay if you're younger
but being an adult
then you cannot do much things and you don't have (um)
a place to go you can't go anywhere
you know and then (um)
and it's a it's almost is almost lockdown [ah] and then ya
<malay>semua benda boleh boleh</malay> change <malay>kalau tak betul-betul you can change you <malay>punya</malay>
perspective you can be
crazy also <malay>juga</malay> [kan]

<malay>tak tahu</malay> how it will go on [lah] but I guess
