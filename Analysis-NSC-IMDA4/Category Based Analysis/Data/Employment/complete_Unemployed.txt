okay
alright <malay>boleh</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> [eh] okay so basically <malay>aku tanya</malay> (uh) whoever living at my place first to do this [lah] cause I thought need to do at my house
then I <malay>aku</malay> call <malay>siapa</malay> #ham# boy <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) I they technically live near my place [what] so easier so I call them <malay>dua dua tak nak buat</malay>
I actually [oh] my god I forgot to tell ham he told me (uh) <malay>dia nak fikir dulu</malay>
and ya he say he want to think about it first
but I mean come on [ah]
I rather do it now with you then wait for his reply what you know what I mean
because
I'm not sure whether because they say the spots are filling up very fast
[ah] <malay>nanti kita</malay> sign up then wasted <malay>tak dapat macam mana</malay>
so I say that to him [lah]
no is based on <malay>macam</malay> first come first basis
(mm)
okay basically (err) my friend <malay>hantar aku ni</malay> okay before that she wanted me to go for a debate
so they were looking for people to debate [lah] like eighty
eighty dollars if you get
[ah] I'm not sure whether per debate or what because I mean I love to debate [what]
so (uh)
<malay>sekali</malay> suddenly she just sent me this [lah] so I actually thought this was a debate
[ah] so <malay>aku</malay> so I ask my mum first if she allow she say okay
then I [ah] call you [lah] (uh) I was looking for people [ah] <malay>macam</malay> #ham# boy
(err) I
actually one of my friend who stay <malay>kat</malay>
<malay>rumah</malay>
[ah] very near right <malay>tapi dia tak nak</malay>
like I don't I don't get some people <malay>punya</malay> mindset <malay>macam</malay>
you just need to talk for one hour
with me
we've known each other for how many years
twelve seven years
<malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>satu jam pun tak boleh berbual</malay>
you know what I mean
maybe maybe maybe
alright okay so
<malay>sekolah amacam</malay>
(mm)
seriously [ah]
okay
okay we don't talk about [lah] [eh]
is (err)
that's yes correct that's the main reason why I left
(uh huh)
[ah] right
that's the thing [ah]
[oh] my god <malay>teruk</malay>
<malay>merepek</malay> no no no seriously
even
but government allow sport activity [what]
[ah] actually <malay>aku</malay> call <malay>kawan aku ni pasal</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> because the thing why they don't want [ah] ask you first is because you live very far away I thought you need to come and to my place
[ah]
so I call this guy he's known for speaking [ah] good malay
(uh) to mix we always mix
[ah] always any conversation we have automatic <malay>kita selalu</malay> mix <malay>gini</malay> mix <malay>gitu</malay> mix <malay>gini</malay> mix <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah]
[a'ah] it's very standard [ah]
(err) okay so three wishes
I would wish
to have (err)
army style discipline
okay
because
correct but it takes a lot of work
and you know me I'm a very lazy person
okay okay okay [lah] let's stop like unrealistic not unrealistic but
things which are not reachable our wishes okay
I would wish
[oh] my god
you know what
<malay>kita tukar</malay> question [jer] [ah]
<malay>tukar</malay> question
okay next question
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
why do you like what what what were your dreams or what are your dreams
ya can can
(mm) [ah] okay okay
so
let me guess <malay>kau kene kerja</malay> for
very hard for maybe a few years before you can actually like you know
settle down relax there K <malay>dah</malay> settled
something like that
[ah] alright alright alright alright I understand I understand
me
basically right if I were to follow my dreams
I would drop my (err) future [lah]
basically my livelihood
because that K basically I really want to
[ah] be a professional sports player
okay
(uh huh)
a professional sports player maybe soccer football K we talk about soccer [lah] cause
they have very good prospect in a sense
(err) but the thing is if at this age I were to like you know try
maybe I'll take one to two years mean at least twenty plus then I'll be in a professional team
but in the meantime who's gonna pay for my livelihood
for example if I made it big who's gonna before I make it big who's gonna pay for my part maybe I want play in a England who gonna pay for my flight there accommodation food
[ah] so before that success I have to
the risk basically my parents money [lah]
[ah]
ya that that's another thing
because
okay let's not talk into specific [lah] but
Singapore soccer is a no no [lah]
even ex players also tell me is I don't know like for leisure leisure okay [lah] <malay>tapi nak</malay>
commit and [ah] <malay>macam apa</malay>
all macam #haziq#
[ah] that's a bit unrealistic the passion is (uh) actually is that I understand I used to have that passion but to be realistic and have a livelihood in Singapore using that kind of (err)
career pathway so called
it is not realistic to have a easy life [lah]
[ah]
alright
sorry
[ah] true true Malaysia pay better
(um)
[ah] but then <malay>nak cakap dorang bayar ke tak tu lain cerita</malay> [lah]
but I mean it is what it is
yeah
alright
next question if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
ya basically any superpower [ah]
but why though
police police are you all hearing this police
me I would love to teleport [ah]
anywhere and everywhere
!wah! so I don't have to think about being late
so I don't have to pay for transport
actually basically it's about being late [lah] I don't want to be late [lah]
ya so for example [ah]
my parents ask me to be home by seven
six fifty nine I <malay>aku dah kat rumah</malay>
six fifty nine
if possible at six fifty nine point fifty nine
the fifty nine second <malay>aku dah kat rumah</malay>
(mm)
no
I mean it looks
interesting honestly it looks interesting
but I am watching a more
not realistic more historical drama
basically I'm I'm watching [ah]
it is a
historical turkish drama so basically before how they found turkish the ottoman empire right how to ottoman empire started
this is how this is the drama about [lah]
[ah]
so they talk about the <malay>dulu orang</malay> Turkey <malay>macam mana macam mana dorang</malay> settle <malay>hal</malay>
(uh) <malay>rumah tangga</malay>
(uh) <malay>musuh</malay>
<malay>cucuk belakang</malay> and all [ah] [oh] my god I tell you
it is an emotional story
(um) sad
<malay>berbual pasal sedih ada</malay>
<malay>marah sampai nak</malay> bang table <malay>ada</malay> serious serious it it was all emotion
but
no it's a series series
(mm) but the first two seasons super draining
super draining cause they go through torture after torture after torture
yeah
(hmm)
okay let's see
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago
what would be inside
wait what
if
okay I I don't understand this question do you
if you could turn back time
[oh]
I think they should put
if you could turn back them where would you go to
that will be an easy answer
I will turn back to
primary four
why
because basically I got first in class [ah] in primary three right
okay
it was a fluke I didn't study and it was a super fluke seriously
so I got first in class so I got confident so sorry primary five primary five
so primary four I was like you know competing with this guy that guy <malay>macam</malay> the race to become first in class [ah]
then I got first in class again in primary four you know
then <malay>sekali</malay> come to primary five <malay>dah kerek</malay> [kan] two years in a row [ah] don't need study [ah] #lepak# [ah]
it's time to blend in because I I won't I didn't blend blend in well (err) in primary school
[ah] because
(um)
how to say [eh]
I might have been a little bit of a smart alec
so people generally disliked me actually
yup
no [lah] I mean that that's the problem [ah] because
back then
if I didn't I hadn't had this issue and I didn't I wasn't arrogant
I wouldn't have (err) you know
instead of the okay <malay>sekarang kita dah</malay> first in class [eh] <malay>kita</malay> focus [jer] how to be best in the cohort
I was like there are these people dislike me I want to blend in with them
so <malay>aku</malay> start <malay>bergaul dengan dorang</malay> be like them
#lepak# <malay>kat luar</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>tak belajar</malay> after oral
<malay>dorang semua balik</malay>
<malay>aku main</malay> catching
[ah] prank <malay>orang punya rumah ketuk pintu lari</malay> you know
you knock the door get out of the staircase go down
[ah] play soccer at the void deck all [lah] so
I will change my mindset [lah] but then without this the the thing is the thing about life right
<malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kita punya</malay>
past <malay>tak terjadi</malay>
it wouldn't us in the future
so that's the thing I'm like if I could turn back time would I turn back time
but if this didn't happen I wouldn't be like this you know what I mean
yes definitely
because
I hate this [ah] cliche phrase
but as annoying and cliche and you know like <malay>jijik</malay> as it is
it's true [ah] what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I mean basically that song was over how do you say over hyped
like you know for example [ah] that song is good
but then a lot of people start to sing it before you even get to hear it is like !wah!
I'm not gonna listen to it because people make it sound so annoying for example
I still remember this song payphone
it was a famous song it was not bad of a song [ah] [kan] maroon five is one of the
yeah one of the good guys
but because of people around like payphone I'm like no I'm not gonna listen to it
[ah]
<malay>tapi kau tahu apa lebih teruk tak</malay>
what's worse is you hate a song
like you are that early not early founders [ah] basically before other people hear and it's overhyped you hear this
then people start [eh] you know this song or not but you are thinking these songs like two three weeks ago
but then after two three weeks then people start to hype it like this song [ah]
old town road
so
I think I've not formerly I was I listen to it because [ah] there was this video playing that song [ah] so like [oh] not bad the the the song is quite catchy okay
I go search old town road K [ah] I put it in my playlist for like one two weeks
I removed from my playlist then people start telling me about this song I'm like
it's in my heart I'm like excuse me
<malay>kau zaman bila ni</malay>
you know but I'm like [oh] ya [eh] nice song nice song [ah]
so it's damn annoying [ah] actually
please please please don't talk about our campus radio
I'm I'm glad he didn't join
we should have been the [lah]
yeah [oh] my god <malay>dorang punya cara berbual</malay>
okay [lah] okay [lah] we cannot throw shades [lah] okay let's not throw shades alright
yeah
okay we have a very good question here
what is the one thing that you wish was free
(mm)
yeah
make sense
yeah precisely
yeah
you know what's worse actually
transport is another matter I feel what needs to be free is healthcare
for those who can't afford it
yeah
because you know
(um)
some countries let's not name them
the price
is horrible
and
some countries [ah] will want you to pay first before the surgery happen imagine right a heart surgery
critical surgery
some (um) country [ah] they you need to pay first know <malay>walaupun berapa</malay> critical <malay>apa dah nazak ke pe</malay> you need to pay first before the surgery happen
(mm)
ya
precisely
(mm) (mm) (mm)
that's a sensitive (uh) topic
okay
let's see next question [eh]
if humans no longer need to work to survive what would we do (mm) very good question
ya we K basically right
what you're trying to say here is like so called
like <malay>dulu punya</malay> time [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> yeah people work work but they work for
for K for example <malay>orang dulu</malay> we they can have chicken they can have cows and all that
so their work is technically just taking care of their their herds [lah]
so in return they get is
food
correct
so actually if you think about it
you don't need to work
you have a few cow sheep chicken
(um) rice
all yours
what do you need to worry about
think about it what do human need
let me phrase that ya what <malay>apa manusia kena ada supaya kita hidup</malay>
food water air
precisely
but because of the modernisation of
the world
people find a need [ah] okay I want a
iphone
because it's the best
and [ah] okay basically iphone is good [lah] those who have it is good but I want a latest iphone because a new one just came out I wanna keep up with the trend
(um) shirt let's spend five thousand dollars on a piece of shirt
which I can get for ten dollars at #pasar malam#
and then
shoe (uh) twenty thousand [lah]
you know [ah] Off-white with Gucci and maybe Versace
yeah
my pants I would spend about two thousand dollars because the materials you know the material actually
I also don't know what the material but it costs two thousand means it's good right
you know something
my friend was talking about someone who
[ah] bought a very expensive car [lah]
(uh) so recently so I was like
okay
so
they are like [eh] you know this this and this bought this and this I'm like [oh] okay so
because like
come on think about it think about it you buy a fast car
in Singapore how fast you wanna go
two hundred kilometre power
you buy something not to make full use of it
this will happen when you got too much money [lah]
you want to show off
and all
give me their money [lah] I can put to better use
okay [oh] yes sorry
(mm)
(uh)
<malay>aku rasa</malay>
<malay>dia punya masalah yang betul</malay> [kan] is actually <malay>apa</malay> [tau]
life <malay>hidup</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> life is so simple
but people just live to complicate it
we don't talk about now we talk about ten years from this since the creation of mankind <malay>ada je masalah</malay>
[ah]
so I guess this is the challenges in life you have to face [lah]
that's harsh but
you gotta do what you gonna do [lah] right
alright next question
[oh] this is a good question what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
everyday activity [lah] <malay>bukan kerja ke apa macam</malay> K for me
for me eating
like
if I'm full
and I don't want to waste food
it is a torture for me
so imagine have to do it for eight hours [oh] my god
[oh] my god I can't imagine it
I think that's the best tortures someone can give me
yeah
I mean K
the thing is yes there are good foods and like for example if a food is good I can eat four times
but
if the food is mediocre one time is enough but even if I were to eat a very nice food right
<malay>nanti muak</malay> [pe]
and what <malay>jelak sama</malay> [jer] [lah]
yeah
ya so like
like they say [ah] everything in moderation is good
no that was that is to
do a certain
ya so that's understandable
[eh] <malay>kau tahu itu hari aku mimpi</malay> [tau] <malay>pasal sekolah</malay>
I guess so I was dreaming this
you were at the table the setting was different [lah]
but the shop and what they sell is is correct
so basically I went to queue for guess guess
what would I buy
yes burger
I was dreaming of the burger but I was thinking the burger in the dream
<malay>macam apa tau dia punya ayam</malay> doesn't look good <malay>dia punya telur</malay> doesn't look good
so I'm like [eh] so there's now two shops [eh]
<malay>yang mana lebih sedap</malay> which one looks more appetising because for me
the most important thing in a food
is the look
if I were to try new food [lah] outside food the look is so important
(mm) (mm)
and
(mm)
is that even a question
of course I would come unless I got [ah]
hopefully
[oh] you know what I just want to come [lah]
(um) next month
yeah
if you are wondering why I'm looking at the right right
like you know I'm not looking here because basically the main screen is here but you are at the second screen
(err) [oh] okay okay [oh] okay okay
okay (hmm)
[oh] okay what is the pettiest reason that you would like to dislike someone [eh] sorry sorry sorry
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
(mm)
face
same same same same same
yeah
but ya
I mean it's true but for me I I guess I guess in my opinion
I feel like I have a
intuition that I can read people face so like I know [oh] <malay>muka gini</malay> [ah] <malay>gini</malay> [ah] <malay>orangnya</malay>
some people just the face
it's like you know how they say a picture tells you a thousand words or thousand things yeah I guess I I implement that to people face [ah]
like [oh] <malay>muka dia macam gini rambut dia macam gini</malay> [oh] <malay>macam gini</malay> [ah] <malay>orang dia</malay>
okay I wouldn't say expert because
(err) I mean if I say I'm an expert that will be bragging right
so <malay>tak</malay> [ah] so basically I can tell you two experiences in my life which I was wrong
first
okay the first one was the first was quite right [lah]
because
I see him I think he's like that we got close
then we our way then he is like that
so I guess in a way it's it's right but the one I'm wrong is you
I expected you to be a super <malay>mat rep</malay>
your hair
it's your hair
your hair compliment your face when you first came in school
but come on [lah] it was like what blonde
(err) <malay>perang perang</malay> [kan]
so actually !alamak! confirm <malay>mat rep</malay> [eh] <malay>fikir dia siapa</malay> [sia]
then I was like
[ah] see [ah] this [one] [ah]
see a lot of her classmates like that already
but when I got to know you all you all are the best people in
you have to admit [ah]
as strenuous as three as our course is
we have the best people
in our course yes
but compared to other course compared to other course we are like
pretty little rascals
like for example try what we do go to engineering course I think the <malay>apa</malay> the headmaster <malay>apa</malay>
course head [eh] <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] the
[eh] don't do this [lah]
you know what I mean you are like come on [lah] you know what
guys you will get caught next time
but #kena# our
you wanna get expelled is it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
but did you do it
yes
I knew it
but I mean for you twenty classes or twenty opportunities to look for the right one
<malay>kau</malay> confirm <malay>menyesal sikt kenapa</malay> #hamizan# <malay>tak ingat</malay>
no comments
(um) okay
let's see
what is the pet sorry we went through that already okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would that be
what would they be
I
(um)
for me
mike ross
yes photographic at absolute best memory
everything I hear everything I see is in my head
I want to that kind of memory
(um)
can [ah] but how long want to train
yeah
that's first second is (err)
skill [eh]
what skill [eh] <malay>apa kita boleh buat</malay> let me see let me see
maths
[ah] I am good at cracking jokes
I already master that since I was like primary school so
but maths [ah] maths [ah] like you know people who need the calculator and like
you go shop then got a lot of (uh) discount this discount that interest this interest that
that is inevitable so like when they calculate I calculate it must tally so that they cannot cheat me [ah]
[ah]
I straight away you give me okay twenty percent of this with ten percent of that then minus zero point eight percent of this then you get this this this this this I want to have it in my head
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya but not the maths that we use like you know what I mean
like depends depends depends
algebra would be used for those algebraic works
but plus minus times divide
<malay>itu penting paling penting paling mustahak</malay>
yes
okay
<malay>aku tengah tengok dia orang punya</malay> question
it's good [lah] they give a few
so that we don't run out of things to talk about
okay did
okay wait let me search the meaning of this word retrospect
!alamak! cannot search [ah]
what is do you have any idea what's the meaning of retrospect
I mean I heard of it before tapi <malay>macam</malay>
actually I heard but I don't know the meaning [lah]
K retrospect
a survey or review for past course of events [oh] basically
a remembrance of a past course of event
that you feel is funny but at that time is not funny
okay I got one
so me and cyprus skip class <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>cerita ni</malay>
and <malay>terjumpa</malay> fabian
okay
so
that is my first time meeting fabian okay
you all told me he was scary he was this he was that
so he would I mean I didn't laugh but inside my heart I was laugh but after that when I leave the office I also laugh
but then it's not funny [lah] okay we skip class
then you know his (uh) <malay>dia punya cara marah macam mana</malay> [kan] see he will talk nicely then suddenly he shout
then you remember remember the joke
take out the ring take out the lanyard
put hand on our table look at both of us he always do that
ya ya ya ya
but if you think about it if you think about it is actually
a scolding [ah] a serious scolding [ah]
but
sometimes you gotta take
the silver lining of a bad situation right
I deserve the scolding
okay but
I gotta cheer myself up
<malay>takde</malay> [lah]
[ah]
I mean
it's hard [lah] it's hard
yeah
damn but
[oh] my god I miss class
ninety percent of people I miss [lah] definitely
ninety percent
that that ten percent
you cannot talk about it [lah] [eh] let's not throw shade to people [lah] [eh]
but [oh] my god I miss our class with
(uh) #ham# boy
S&W
(uh)
you only spend time when [ah]
actually you only spend time when we going home so I miss going home with you [lah]
like that we really sit down and talk
[ah]
[ah] yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
I mean I was [ah]
I was always with cyprus and at that point of time I was like you know researching about laptops [lah] <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
[ah]
so I mean it it it comes in handy
but not every time [lah]
[ah] definitely <malay>adalah orang nak beli</malay> laptop so I can them like bombard them
[ah]
but
come on it was something super unexpected
but is the biggest reason is because
okay we were O level students correct
you were you were you were right you were O levels what okay what
is our true purpose of
(um) graduating from secondary school for O levels student
like what is our so called rite
poly or correct
so okay [lah]
maybe O level we couldn't do well
because of certain subjects at maths science I don't know what else okay
(err)
ya okay then you have to go to okay
then from where's where's the next destination
precisely but my grades are not good enough to even you know try to get into a <malay>apa</malay>
so <malay>aku macam</malay> [oh] my god
I when I never study I get this but when I study
I get zero point zero two
points better like <malay>apalah nak jadi</malay>
<malay>kenapa</malay> [lah] <malay>hidup macam ni</malay>
you know what I mean
but
it's for me is <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] like I I can't believe [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
K [ah] <malay>kalau gini dah tak boleh masuk</malay> poly [kan] what what's the point
[ah]
and I have better options [ah] I have better prospect so
obviously [ah] <malay>kita macam</malay> you know what
if I'm gonna go this way
<malay>kita punya</malay> pathway <malay>macam gini</malay> [jer]
but if I choose another way I got better potential so I did the right thing but was hard thing to do [ah] to leave you all
but do you know what made it easier
because I hated every moment of
one week then I didn't come for another one week
ya <malay>macam</malay> is <malay>merepek bila kita kat sekolah dorang bagi kerja masih sikit</malay> [jer]
you know what I mean
<malay>abeh kalau kat rumah</malay> I mean K fine fine it's true we are free we are more free
but you don't push a big
lump sum of work to us just because we are free we are not
accustomed to that [what] you know what I mean
like giving
precisely I <malay>aku</malay> it is
I find it super <malay>merepek</malay>
so it it made me like [oh] you know what [ah] so tiring [ah] <malay>malas</malay> [ah]
[ah] <malay>tak leh</malay> [ah] <malay>tak leh</malay> [ah]
so
true [lah] true
yeah
<malay>abeh</malay> come by my house [lah] one once in a while
I really busy but if you come I can make time for you because K basically right now I'm more free [ah]
cause I'm laying low a bit
[ah] I'm relaxing a bit
gathering myself for bigger things [lah] in the future
(mm) so you can actually come down
<malay>dah kat kat mana</malay>
three more right
(mm)
alright alright I I will look forward I will look forward then will be here for
!huh!
[eh] #kim# <malay>cam</malay>

<malay>kalau kau tanya aku</malay> [eh] (mm)
okay <malay>kalau kau tanya aku</malay> this about
now I'm nineteen right maybe nine years ago
okay with me in my teens thirteen I mean I'm still my teens but
when I still interested in sports
definitely fit body
hundred percent
because I could go far
I really could go far but
like that [lah] this I guess this my fate [lah]
so if
in the past yeah fit body now [ah]
whatever god give me I'll take [lah]
like (uh) whatever it is [lah] good looks fit body
but now I'm going to so I guess I have to choose fit body again [lah]
like know because
if they give us like pre before you <malay>masuk</malay> right
<malay>dorang kata</malay> if we pass we get two months off know
<malay>siapa tak nak</malay>
[ah] but [oh] my god you ask me to you ask me to run okay sit up manageable but I'm just not a upper upper body strength guy
that's why that's why like I don't play
hyper transport
and even if I do play right the roads I play are very
suit to my body [lah] like
okay for example <malay>kalau</malay> soccer we don't need upper body strength technically technically
we don't need upper body strength
<malay>kalau</malay> basketball [oh] definitely [ah] you need upper body strength [ah] but that means
like I pay for competition <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>kau tahu kawan aku suruh buat apa</malay>
#izzul# <malay>kau jangan</malay> pass <malay>kau jangan</malay> shoot [eh] sorry sorry sorry
you don't pass don't shoot [eh]
don't pass
don't need
just defend the ball
because I'm the fastest guy in court
so it's annoying [lah] because
fastest
sometimes means the best but I'm the fastest but not the best
no no no K basically in basketball [kan] <malay>kalau kau main</malay>
if you look at the oppunent team [eh]
the best is usually the fastest
[ah] but then you put
myself in my shoe you put yourself in my shoe I'm the fastest but I'm not the best in fact the worst [ah] offensively
[ah]
so
but I have to keep up with those (uh) because yeah basketball is technically new to me I started playing like what four years ago only and people have been playing since primary school
so my game and <malay>dorang punya</malay> game <malay>tak sama</malay> definitely they are better game sense than me
okay that's one
so I'm not exposed to
basketball as much as them so they can do things
not to my knowledge <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dorang buat ni aku tak boleh</malay> counter
and you tell me okay so just do this do this do that but then I still can't do it because I'm just not (um)
used to it [ah] like I'm not exposed to it [what]
[ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) yes
okay
there's one good question
actually not one good question I've been saying that for the past few questions
if you were to eat one dish
for the rest of your life what would it be
for the rest of your life
for me
<malay>punya nasi ayam</malay>
<malay>dengan dorang punya sayur</malay>
for the rest of my life bro
<malay>tak kira apa-apa</malay> [lah]
frugal [eh]
the one near the bus stop to go to
yes yes yes
super cheap super affordable bro I add extra chicken with K
I bought one plate
of a one set you know with the vegetable and all
add extra chicken add extra rice costs me less than
seven eight dollars
less than that no five six dollars you know
where you're gonna get in Singapore
your house [lah] because free [what]
right
[oh] chicken rice for the win bro
funny [ah] you
nah
nah nah nah nah nah
poly is not my thing anymore studying is not my thing anymore !chey!
[oh] I mean you want to go there to eat chicken rice I will probably get scolded by my parents
but I don't mind
you know because (uh) you have to understand in Singapore <malay>susah nak dapat</malay> natural food even it comes to the most natural thing
chicken
beef
[ah]
correct so parents <malay>aku suka apa</malay> [tau] they like (err)
#kampung# chicken they make sure it's from a
not say #kampung# [lah] but you know #kampung# means they bring it up naturally
[ah] it it it you don't have to worry about the
others [lah]
(uh)
correct correct
yes yes
so they are very particular when it comes to food because it's the basic survival [what] the basic survival need
<malay>makanan air</malay>
[eh]
air <malay>bahasa melayu apa</malay> [ah]
<malay>angin tu</malay> wind
<malay>oksigen</malay> [ah] <malay>ni</malay> <malay>dalam melayu</malay> properly [ah] [eh]
<malay>oksigen</malay> [ah] the proper the proper malay pronunciation for oxygen
O K S I
G E N <malay>oksigen</malay>
okay maybe it's oxygen
maybe [ah] I don't know it's been a long time K last time I I we use that was like primary six I think
yeah
<malay>kau punya</malay> okay [ah] let me see [eh]
what do you think of the COVID situation now
sometimes better is not enough right
then
ya !wah! I mean
true [lah] true
then <malay>tak tahu dapat dorang punya</malay> salary <malay>ke tak</malay>
<malay>dorang punya</malay> families <malay>kat</malay> overseas <malay>macam mana</malay>
but you
you you know something that I wish they could implement in Singapore because of this COVID nineteen situation
every store
okay or at least those super crowded store
that people will go to
have a
book reservation <malay>punya</malay>
(uh) system
so we don't have to queue and wait
what time they give they allow us to be there we'll be there
but be strict [ah]
we book from this time to this time exactly at that time you must leave
[ah]
correct
(mmhmm)
(um)
<malay>kalau dorang buat ni</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau dorang buat ni kan</malay>
<malay>dorang punya</malay> tracking system <malay>pun senang tau</malay> actually you know what implement to all shops
<malay>dorang buat gini senang nak</malay> track <malay>orang</malay>
!wah!
yeah
you know what okay
no very simple
then we open
(um)
like (uh)
<malay>untuk orang turun dengan nak masuk kedai</malay> right
only for pioneer generation [lah]
why not
yeah
correct or not if the old people are not a tech savvy enough okay they go
[ah]
must use the [ah] reservation booking
yeah
<malay>tapi satu masalah</malay> will be <malay>apa</malay> [tau]
(uh) whether they have space or not and but come on [ah]
the
this is the problem right find solution [lah]
not run away or not just like you know what
I don't care
let's just open our shop we need to make money
this the thing about Singapore cause every single thing cause money
every single thing
of course every country but there are countries who [ah]
how to say handle this quite well very very well in fact
ya but
I mean
it is what it is [lah] [ah]
so we just have to take care of ourselves [lah] that's why you know [ah] like
honestly this phase two open my eyes a lot [ah] like
actually we don't have to go out always
okay [lah] playing sports and all is a different thing [lah] you need to you know move because like <malay>berapa hari lepas</malay> [kan] <malay>aku kat rumah je aku macam dah tak leh tahan</malay>
so I just need to get up I I so I went to play #takraw# <malay>kat</malay> #serangoon# <malay>sana</malay>

you go out transport money
food money
shopping money
money money money
everything is money bro you wanna go here to here okay [lah] you never eat outside you bring food from home food food from home also cost money
you got out take transport also money
[ah]
correct
[ah]
ya because K want to #lepak# okay but
not outside you know what I mean like that's why I always invite you to come my house
[ah]
because <malay>kalau</malay> if <malay>kalau kita</malay> #lepak# <malay>kat luar</malay>
it is prone to have problems
[ah] <malay>kalau korang kat rumah aku ke apa</malay> like we just do our own things
like my neighbourhood is very peaceful so okay [lah]

no comments [lah] this kind of thing is very
just let let
let it be [lah] [eh]
we don't have much say but
okay [lah] I mean we'll just don't be those kind of people [lah]

the first one
<malay>apa</malay> what's the last one
okay we'll do this if you were to eat one dish
for the rest [oh] my god it's so lame you <malay>nak makan apa</malay>
ya actually it's not generic because actually the the other day I was actually talking to my friend
and <malay>dia kata apa</malay> he wanted to eat ya I told him if we get like one thing
to eat
then he was like ya <malay>nasi ayam</malay>
then I'm like !huh!
like isn't that like boring but then again like you think about it ya you have the carbs then you have the meat the protein
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
it depends [ah] maybe can switch in with like the roasted or like the steam one
#mee goreng# but you know me and #mee goreng#
<malay>terberak-berak</malay>
I know but it's so good I don't know why it's just that #mee goreng# taste
<malay>entah</malay> [lah]
speaking of <malay>makanan</malay>
I have this so you can
I bought
so my friend bought this you don't mind I don't know if it's halal or not [lah]
which I don't think it is
this is actually #konjac# jelly #konjac# you know C O N J A C
so it's like a shape of a <malay>sotong</malay>
you <malay>tengok</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay> you just look at it first you want turn turn on the lights or no
<malay>kejap</malay> [eh]
[ah] have you tried #mala# before
colleague
no K initially I I don't really like the idea of #mala# cause actually I I went to #hai di lao# we this is not halal
but my friend brought me to #hai di lao# and then they had two
they specifically bought like no pork at all [lah]
(uh) because I was around cause I don't eat pork or don't eat beef right then I eat chicken and seafood
and they were like okay you have to try #mala# they so bad you know like you have to try #mala# I was like what this this this big deal about #mala# [sia] everyone's like talking about it
so then I tried and then
I think it's maybe it's too #kaw#
you know #kaw#
yes
like too strong like that
(uh)
it's chilli oil
yes yes exactly it's the same thing so it's it basically like just chilli oil [lah]
ya
K this one you have to eat it on off the bed out off the bed off the bed
because it might spill I or maybe I open for you [ah]
why you moving that thing over all around
okay K #nah#
try not to spill on your shirt cause you're wearing white
[eh] it's delicious <malay>sedap</malay>
ya (err) okay K ya ya (uh) it so it's #konjac# jelly
so it's basically just jelly
it never says that it's halal or not but it's just jelly basically it's just jelly
but is the shape of <malay>sotong</malay>
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] so that is #mala# this is the most spiciest one
you know how I don't like spicy right
so when she gave there was there's a green one there's an orange one
which is less spicy the green one is spicy is is spicy and sour
the orange one is less spicy the red one is super spicy
but I realized about this #mala# taste is like the spicy is like now spicy it doesn't like linger
so the <malay>tak pedas sangat</malay> like
<malay>ada rasa macam dia</malay> then then <malay>dia tak macam meresap</malay> or like or like <malay>lama-lama macam tu</malay>
ya you know like it will stuck then I will be I hate that feeling that's why I don't like spicy food actually
so this is actually kind of perfect
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] <malay>sedap</malay> [kan]
so (um) I google and then youtube this thing <malay>cuba tengok dia orang makan macam mana</malay> (um) basically they open like four five packets
<malay>dekat dalam mangkuk</malay> and then <malay>apa</malay>
you just eat it off like that it's actually really delicious [eh]
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan]
you think the conversation is good
like
they will accept this conversation at us <malay>kunyah-kunyah makan-makan</malay>
(mm)
ya you know so my friend was kind enough she bought
two packets for me
ya so there's four packets [ah] the other two is for my other friend
so I brought it home first
but you see the shape of the <malay>sotong</malay> is actually it looks legit <malay>macam sotong</malay>
[oh] my bad <malay>jangan kena baju</malay>
it will really stain <malay>tadi tadi</malay> you drop on my <malay>kasut</malay>
(uh) (uh)
then don't bother <malay>makan dia punya</malay> oil
you can just throw it away
because
stingy [ah]
<malay>macam apa</malay> what's that word [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>rasa dia macam berdesing itu</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(um)
[ah] okay okay so
was it yesterday that I was working

bump into this one man [ah] he we were walking
or like whatever [lah] I I don't think that was like the specific
scenario but <malay>dia kata</malay>

credit card
meaning like unlimited spending <malay>dekat dalam itu ada macam</malay> a billion dollars he say you can do whatever you want with it [lah]
like he bump into you so you ask for for compensation I think and then what will you do with the money

if you were to have [ah]
he let you spend use the card for one hour what would you do with the <malay>duit</malay>
(mm)
bear in mind <malay>satu jam</malay> [jer]

the whole of ion building including residences
like each and every one of the residences and the whole ion
shopping centre itself

K it's getting a bit too personal already
yes I was in <malay>apa</malay> exhibition line but
I thought of like changing
changing the career line [lah]
<malay>nak nak setengah jam</malay>
changing the career and instead of
<malay>apa kerja</malay> in exhibition maybe I take something else so that's why I'm like thinking a lot about
this whole cause the whole of (uh) the whole talk of like career switch whatever then I was thinking about it [lah]
maybe I should should I should I or should I not or is it a waste of money
what do you think personally
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) of course [ah] but I'm just thinking like
it's more of a personal thing to be to be honest it's more of a personal I want to know why people act such way and
not only people but myself also [lah]
(mmhmm)
no like just diploma first
of course
(mmhmm)

into making a mask
you know the face mask that we are wearing
cause like everyone's wearing a normal
normal mask the most fanciest one is they buy from like
carousell whatever
(uh) ya very lame and cheap and always the same design

actually you know what that time when I went to new york for new year's
new year's new york
this year how it really change [eh]
(mm)

<malay>entah</malay> [lah] next year's different already
come my friend is sell trying to sell me something
come on faster faster <malay>nak tengok berapa harga dia</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>tengok</malay> [lah]
some E commerce thing
typing typing <malay>tapi tapi tak tak tak hantar hantar sudah</malay> [lah]
<malay>apa nama ini</malay>
[oh] ya it feels just like yesterday it feels like so long time ago but then it feels like it's just like yesterday I <malay>pun tak tahu apa maksud</malay>
really right like it feels like yesterday but it's actually a long time ago it's actually
know it feels so long ago but it's actually just this year only to give I mean yes
you get what I mean
then I'm like
and then I wouldn't call it like the curse of twenty twenty but a lot of things really happen there like the airbnb didn't go well
the whole ya I told you about the airbnb didn't go well
<malay>apa</malay>
(uh) <malay>cakap dekat sini</malay> but in the end <malay>dekat tempat lain</malay>
it was supposed to be like five minutes off times square but instead it's like
no not twenty twenty is really slow walk [ah] but it's about fifteen minutes
no less than fifteen ten mintues ten fifteen minutes
walk down to times square it it's still a good location [ah] in the end we loved it [ah]
in the end we loved it we grew to love it but initially we thought it was just beside so like can see the
fireworks whatever but in the it's actually far away and then in the end
we wanted we the whole idea was to was to do new year's
new york twenty twenty new york new year twenty twenty
to see the fireworks whatever the ball drop [ah]
ya hello we went
because of the airbnb the stupid airbnb is like so far away not far away about fifteen minutes away
we had to buy the because the roads were cordoned off
we didn't know so I went down I was like (um) #sya# was
that's why a lot of things happened
<malay>gigi dia sakit</malay>
then she cannot wake up early then I was like okay I wake up early I just
<malay>tutup dahulu</malay>
okay <malay>kejap ini bising</malay>
so I woke up early just to see
whether we can go to times square cause I
I seriously thought you don't need to pay anything apparently people can queue to get inside the ball drop
but you have to queue like the night before
then the night before we were walking right was empty
so I didn't know you have to queue like we we were home which was about maybe three people start queuing already
and you cannot leave if you leave you <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>nak kena</malay>
ya which is
too far they were cordoned off already
like if you leave your spot means you leave your spot so <malay>macam mana nak berak nak kencing nak makan</malay>
like you have to really have to picnic and it's out in the cold it's like winter it's like four degrees
you really have to pack <malay>mesti bau masam</malay> [kan] ya ya
so I went down at about
ten no wait ya
slightly earlier than ten I was like [eh] the roads are closed
the police officer was like no no no enter I was like no I want to buy something he was like no you no then I was like my friend is over there I don't know where I stay
then he was like nope
no excuses turn back so I was like [oh] shoot then I say how do I get in he say you have to purchase a ticket I was like !huh!
so we went I went online
and then found out there is this bar hopping
within that area
is not in in but it's around
around the no not around the area but is like within the ball drop you can see the ball drop the bar hop within the
(uh) <malay>apa</malay> the ball drop [ah]
and it costs five hundred I thought I told you before
(mm)
it costs five hundred so ya I think it that was like
part of the twenty twenty curse a lot of thing really happened
but it didn't felt it it felt much more of an adventure instead of this whole year
ya this whole year was like a lot of slacking actually inside this room
a lot a lot of slacking a lot of <malay>baring</malay> here <malay>baring</malay> there I clean the rooms
<malay>tukar langsir</malay>
<malay>tukar lampu</malay>
carpet [eh] seriously I need to change this carpet
(mmhmm)
see
#alhamdulillah#
but that's good right
I told you right see the positivity
yes manifestation of positivity and who pushed you
who went around

ya he did [what]
exactly a long time ago [what]
yes #samled#
mister #samled#

<malay>kesian abang salim</malay>
#samled# mister <malay>abang samled</malay>
mister <malay>abang samled</malay> that's like
codeswitching
mister <malay>abang samled</malay>
<malay>kesian dia</malay>
like towards the end I never expected [eh]
<malay>kesian dia</malay>
ya
the <malay>lorek</malay> version of [ah] [mah]
I didn't feel as sad as I should be
I don't know why
because I wasn't around for the longest time [kan] <malay>tak terasa</malay> but actually I love him so much [eh]
he's been forever [kan]
since you were like four or five
ya four or five [ah]
until you're like what seventeen
sec five
so seventeen
sixteen
ya seventeen minus five is like what
twelve years man that cat
ya ya <malay>dah tua pun dah dah apa</malay>
but ya no [lah] <malay>gigi yang nenek kucing</malay> is like twenty plus <malay>apa</malay>
(mm) no <malay>itu betul-betul menjaga</malay> [seh]
ya
he had no restrictions he could have gone anywhere everywhere but he still remain [orh]
<malay>kesian dia</malay>
mister <malay>soput itu nak kena sebat</malay>
actually I felt like I want to take a pet actually
ya what's the point right
<malay>macam menyeksa</malay>
<malay>kesian dia seorang seorang</malay>
I was really thinking a lot about this during quarantine
ya but during quarantine during
remember
so it's like !wah! <malay>ini kalau</malay> <malay>ada</malay> (uh) ya can always <malay>teman</malay> [what] like someone to talk to
instead of <malay>seorang seorang</malay>
ya exactly then it's going to be <malay>perap</malay> in this whole room
speaking of which rental so my friend was thinking
should we move in together you saw that house
that listing ya
ya that's why
the room is small smaller than this
yes
I no this is to be honest this is actually a perfect size for me
I can fit like this
queen sized bed I still got a
considerable amount of space to <malay>joget-joget</malay>
or like walk around and do my work here or like
move around [lah] at least I got I can have stuff to throw around like <malay>bersepahkan</malay>
yes exactly so like to move to a smaller space I cannot I cannot
downgrade myself
I can upgrade myself but then the thing is everything <malay>semua sekarang tengah mahal</malay> I don't know [ah] like
I have no idea okay [lah] probably yes I have an idea what is is <malay>mahal</malay> now because
everyone needs the money
but
seriously everyone
everyone left already all the expats all left already so like
why is everything still so expensive
like there's a lot of things on the market but everything's expensive
odd right
(mmhmm)
you want to swap
yes I want to swap I'm telling you I want to swap
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
<malay>panasnya</malay> #ya allah#
then that that that's the thing price should be <malay>kurang apa</malay> should be lesser [what]
shouldn't be that expensive [what] to entice people to buy [what] or like rent
downgrade
decrease
(mmhmm)
I hope it will
because that place looks good
but then the thing is really small [lah]
and <malay>nak itu pasang apa</malay>
a false wall
and then have to <malay>pasang</malay> another door it's going to be costly it is going to cost like more then two three hundred dollars already
then like I'm like !huh!
no not only that he say he wants to do like short term like maybe three
or six months then I was like no only if you are doing this [ah]
for one year at least one year I'm looking at one year and above not not at least one year
one year and above
then I can consider moving in with you then he was like [oh] I was looking at maybe like maybe three to six months then I'm like [ah] okay no way
but it's costly [lah]
it's nice [sia] it's nice it is really cozy like with the lights and all [kan] with the window
[oh] ya speaking of which just now I pass by (uh) river valley
so I was looking at that place then I'm like [oh] my god I really miss that place
I really miss that place
!huh! I miss the outside I was like walking through the whole thing
[ah] that
I love the outside I hated my room
it's like porter room so small
river valley
wait where you which one you talking about
#potong pasir#
no
#potong pasir# yes
#potong pasir# I love the room because it was an upgrade
the outside of the house was like <malay>rimas</malay>
they clean once in a while it was nice
then after that <malay>bersepah lagi</malay> then <malay>rimas makin lama makin lama makin rimas</malay>
the room is nonsense but the hall is huge and I'll always sleep slept at the hall
yes
(hmm)
!huh! when
she cook curry
(mm)
!huh! then where was I
[oh] interesting
ya I miss that place because of the hall and then it was overlooking the pool the huge windows I have this thing with windows [ah] <malay>tingkap macam</malay> best
exactly exactly plus the hall was already so huge
so the windows made it look huger
look bigger huger you know make it look
bigger
ya if only the rent there is cheap
yes it's considerably expensive ya of course for myself
no no no no no no no no no rent a proper room this (uh) this time round [lah] but it's still expensive now is too expensive
it's like almost two thousand dollars
[kan] <malay>mahal</malay>
you can do so many things with two thousand dollars
that's the thing about renting you have to really think about it like I told my friend he was like should I move out or should I move in with my brother then I was like (uh)
you <malay>fikir masak-masak dulu</malay> like from now until february because he was thinking of moving in february
then I was like <malay>fikir masak-masak dulu</malay> like if you move in
[eh] no not move in like once you pay rent it feels good for the first month because you are paying for like something that you are staying in
the second month okay still okay the third month onwards is like a bit like a bit ridiculous because you are like you feel like
what am I doing
like why am I putting this amount of money
to rent
(mm)
but then again it is when like you have to pay to stay right

okay can

ya coming into december then my parents think about renovation for their house and the renovation is a little bit of a nightmare
not because of the [tau] but because of the house itself you want me tell you the story
no it's not haunted
not son of a peach <malay>punya</malay>
it is our oldest house
(err) block one two eight is near to the swimming pool behind the hill ya so <malay>masa</malay> I <malay>kecil-kecil</malay> there will always be like sounds of dogs howling at night
ya
then there will also be <malay>macam ada bau tak sedap</malay> [ah] but okay my family <malay>tak kena sangat</malay> [ah] but our neighbour <malay>pernah</malay>
<malay>nak dengar</malay> ghost story
so my neighbour I think <malay>tingkat dua</malay> we stay at the fourth floor so at night I think <malay>pukul sepuluh ke apa</malay> there was somebody who came over to their house <malay>macam</malay> you know the <malay>makcik-makcik jual keropok</malay> (err) they went at ten o’clock why do you open the door to a person who selling things right but my neighbour go and open [ah] so it it was a <malay>makcik</malay> selling cake <malay>tunjuk</malay> the cake all that so <malay>macam</malay> my neighbour <malay>kasihan</malay> then my neighbour <malay>pun beli</malay> [lah] the cake
so the <malay>makcik dah</malay> go off I think the next day they open up the cake there was a <malay>batu nisan</malay> inside
(err) I can't recall the exact time the exact year but I think it was when I was in secondary school around there [lah]
mine was like maybe in the early two thousands [ah]
I think mama got tell a little bit of this story before then she like <malay>tersipu-sipu</malay>
K wait let me tell you the story of my parents <malay>punya</malay> renovation so they just got the key on #deepavali# like after like one month of extension then that [one] also like a little bit of a <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] cause the previous tenant they don't want to give the key to the letter box then my parents have to like repeatedly ask for it <malay>sebab dorang dah</malay> change <malay>dorang punya</malay> address
<malay>abeh entah</malay> [lah] like very #niao# [ah] so after that eventually they wanted to give the key on fifteen of november #deepavali# is fourteen but their agreement is only until fourteen of november so obviously my parents not happy it's just one day but then that weekend is a weekend <malay>yang</malay> they wanted to clean up the house cause sixteen november they will start the renovation already
so (err) eventually on fourteen november they got the key then (um) we went to the house the next day #taufik# <malay>pun pergi</malay> the house used to house twenty cats in the master bedroom
it was super smelly then the toilet was also super smelly we wash the master bedroom a few times everytime <malay>cuci</malay> [jer] <malay>keluar</malay> like black black black it's a few times you know then we went to pet store to <malay>beli</malay> the odour eliminator [ah] spray around a few times I think (err) we went on sunday last spray for the things then (err) I went again on monday
the next day [ah] the next day <malay>bau masih tak hilang</malay> [ah] cause twenty cats [seh] so spray spray spray <malay>lagi</malay> still <malay>tak hilang abeh bila</malay> I <malay>balik</malay> I was like having like a huge headache then (err) eventually I call (err) <malay>macam</malay> professional cleaning service
like they really will use an ozone generator to produce ozone to shock the smell and then they will they use a chemical atomiser <malay>juga</malay> so the chemical they break it down into like super super small molecule so that it can go into the porous surfaces [ah] so yesterday the person came the person it's a malay guy then the <malay>masuk</malay> the <malay>nak buat dia</malay> [eh]
<malay>tanya</malay> [eh] <malay>ni ada berapa kucing ni</malay> [seh] <malay>lepas tu</malay> I <malay>cakap dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>ada ada</malay> twenty cats <malay>dia macam</malay> !wah! <malay>teruk</malay> [seh] but he was like telling us that (err) okay [ah] the smell can be removed so he did all the things and then as he was doing it suddenly he went to one of the switch so <malay>dia pergi dekat</malay> switch then he call us [lah] say [eh] I think this house <malay>ada pijat punya</malay> infestation <malay>juga</malay>
because apparently on top of the switch <malay>ada</malay> colour black black black which is actually an indication of <malay>tahi pijat</malay> [ah] so he was like hopefully all the <malay>pijat bila orang tu angkat dah bawa sekali</malay> [ah] the all the bed bugs <malay>semua</malay> but we don't know whether inside the switch plug itself there will be <malay>pijat</malay> or not so yes but yesterday my mum <malay>pergi dah tak ada</malay> the smell <malay>sangat</malay> so I guess it worked but
hopefully the smell won't stay [lah]
ya (err) the <malay>pijat</malay> is at the switch so the electrician also came over yesterday was thursday wednesday the electrician came over on wednesday to to to ask what to change [ah] so we are changing the all the switches also just to be safer ya
they when they went <malay>tak ada</malay> the smell <malay>sangat</malay> and then <malay>macam</malay> (um) I think they hide the cats or they spray something on top but <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>macam dua tiga ekor kucing kat</malay> the living room so <malay>macam</malay> we thought it was only two or three cats right so okay [lah] but end up the cause they went again <malay>macam</malay>
after they got the keys then the people ask for extension [kan] so during that period of time they ask whether can go over to the house to like do measurements for the renovation so initially they didn't allow [lah] <malay>dorang tak kasi</malay> then <malay>dah jadi</malay> my parents house <malay>apa</malay> so my parents <malay>pergi tu yang</malay> they were shocked
to see like twenty cats there !oi! <malay>kalau</malay> I think if my parents <malay>tahu pun</malay> they wouldn't have the house [lah] but no <malay>momok</malay> so it's okay
kencing kucing tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>jangan kencing hantu ke apa ke</malay>
ya
<malay>apa bunyi tu</malay>
okay [lah] okay how's your job finding going on
you <malay>cari</malay> you <malay>cari dekat</malay> which what site
serious
have you tried <malay>yang</malay> those the <malay>punya</malay> job fairs <malay>pun tak ada</malay>
okay mendaki
and as in mendaki sense what mendaki sense <malay>pun dorang</malay> will go to like some companies
!aduh! <malay>entah</malay> [lah]
I initially I was also thinking whether I should find a like a full time job cause now mine is adjunct right but then now my adjunct is getting too busy
or not really I mean <malay>tak ada</malay> bonus [ah] and all that <malay>apa</malay> ya as long as still something [ah] like my dad got a job my dad [kan] <malay>masa tu kena</malay> retire he got a job <malay>pun tu tak dapat</malay> bonus <malay>ke apa</malay> so that [one] is that only contract for one year ya
ya hopefully everything get better
[oh] that time my brother my brother is still stuck in qatar right he had to fly back the he had to fly the plane to singapore so he manage to see his family <malay>kat</malay> airport for like one minute to <malay>lambai-lambai</malay> only
ya but (um) he also <malay>kena</malay> so even though they stay at crowne plaza I think all the pilots the flight attendants <malay>semua kena</malay> stay at crowne plaza so ya [lah] they only like <malay>macam</malay> see each other <malay>bila</malay> my brother <malay>keluar dari</malay> the sky train then my sister-in-law and the ya and his (uh) daughter <malay>cuma lambai</malay>
his family had been here since march so my brother has been stuck in qatar for seven months without family
but <malay>tak boleh jumpa</malay> [what] is in different room so what my sister-in-law did was she my my brother <malay>dah lama tak makan makanan melayu</malay> right so
he requested for <malay>nasi lemak</malay> on the first for the breakfast then for lunch he asked for <malay>apa benda tu nasi ambeng</malay> or is it #laksa# one of it [lah] then <malay>malam</malay> he asked for <malay>bandung</malay>
missing all the local food simon to either <malay>macam</malay> like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
(err) they have malaysian restaurant there but then it's still <malay>macam makanan</malay> the variety is not as much [lah] ya
I am not the target audience
what [oh] mama high class you <malay>tak tahu ke</malay>
ya precisely is what five digit figure [eh] I don't know
okay [lah] still not worthy
because ya we are not the target audience
I I was about to ask halal or not halal
mama very particular [what]
ya I agree
ya but mama high class [lah] that time [ah] she was watching her japan show [eh] at at your house [lah] then she texted me (err) #nura# <malay>masa tu kita ada</malay> stay <malay>dekat</malay> hotel #tokyo# one one of the #atas# hotel [lah] then I say no we didn't stay at the #atas# hotel we stayed at another like the same branch but the cheaper version then she was like !wah! <malay>situ ada makanan</malay> halal
<malay>abeh</malay> I said but we also eat <malay>makanan halal apa</malay>
ya [lah] but maybe let mama stay in dorm try
actually if <malay>apa</malay> right if you just go with your parents type or my parents we could have stayed in Airbnb [ah] then can cook and all that
but the thing is mama is not very <malay>macam</malay> open to try food ya it's like <malay>macam</malay> she said like <malay>macam</malay> okay for example like when she went vulcans right I ask her so did you eat like vulcan food then she said actually not really [lah] we just eat like indian food all this thing then I ask mama like what's the point [kan] you're supposed to go like if you go to greece you're supposed to eat greek food you know but then you just go there you end up eating tandoori chicken which you can also eat in singapore
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> #ramen# <malay>tu</malay>
surprisingly she eats #ramen# right but she doesn't eat (um) sushi #sashimi# [kan]
[oh] <malay>kita orang tak bawa pergi</malay> [ah] #sashimi# sushi restaurant that time we ate tempura ya #ramen# #miso# but not sushi she say she [oh] <malay>tak makan</malay> seaweed [kan] so <malay>tak bawa</malay> [ah] but all the rest <malay>dorang makan banyak</malay> obese <malay>apa</malay>
no idea ya like even the (um) <malay>balik punya</malay> flight she was like she said she eat a lot finish up the food all
okay [lah] some aeroplane food is nice
qatar flight food is quite shiok
I agree [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>nasi lemak</malay> I still prefer the silk air <malay>punya</malay> have you tried [ah]
[oh] my god the silk air <malay>punya</malay> is so nice ya [oh] I think out of all the (err) <malay>nasi lemak</malay> okay [ah] not counting like parents masak semua</malay> [kan] silk air <malay>nasi lemak</malay> is like up there ya but you cannot choose [what] so depends on your luck whether you will get the silk air with <malay>nasi lemak</malay> or not
like people say malaysia <malay>punya nasi lemak sedap</malay> [kan] I think silk air [one] that [one] is <malay>sedap</malay>
so I was telling #taufik# like maldives [kan] <malay>ada banyak</malay> island [kan] like can you open up one island just for singaporeans <malay>untuk</malay> okay [what]
right so like when the flight come like the flight to singapore come so only those who are from that island be at the airport cause to okay [lah] then the singaporeans can go to that island then it helps their economy it sustained from also
ya like that that would benefit both countries hello
I think <malay>ni kena</malay> write in to maldives <malay>nya</malay> government [kan]
(mm) now is hong kong but hong kong got so many riots okay I don't know whether the protest are still ongoing but ya I it's not one of my to go list
I haven't been there before [lah] but if I'm going there is only because just to check off the list but I feel that hong kong will be no different from singapore actually I want to go #nairobi# #nairobi# kenya it looks nice I have been following random people on instagram then they have been instagram #storying# their lives right so it's surprisingly for this particular day was a lot of kenyan people so the location was #nairobi# they have really nice homes you know it's like ya [lah] it's quite nice [ah]

he was in adelaide brisbane then singapore indonesia it's like [eh] I thought COVID period you still flying around
(err) he's still the initial part he flew a lot to europe france and italy because they will like evacuating their citizens
<malay>abeh</malay> the later later [one] <malay>banyak</malay> like holiday people ya but qatar <malay>dia punya</malay> border control is still strict not like <malay>macam</malay>
they allow a lot of people to come in [ah] like people they can go to they don't have to quarantine even people from india they can so what I read [lah] on facebook like these indians they want to come to singapore and
and if they come direct they will have to take the COVID test so some of them they go to first they stay there for fourteen days so to <malay>lepaskan</malay> the requirement of the singapore government [ah] <malay>lepas tu baru</malay> they fly to singapore expert
okay [lah] not expert but ya that's what they did I mean I was reading the there's this facebook group called the indians in singapore [ah] like the you know I will read the bangladeshi community in singapore then I read the malaysia singapore malaysians border crosser so recently I venture the indians in singapore so it's like malaysian <malay>punya banyak</malay> like <malay>jiwang-jiwang</malay>
or <malay>rindu</malay> family <malay>cakap dua minggu</malay> [jer] <malay>sekarang dah lapan bulan</malay> that kind of thing then I would say the indians in singapore <malay>banyak</malay> [oh] where is the class for this (err) <malay>ataupun</malay> rented room and talk about how to get to singapore if cannot be direct that kind of thing so ya I find out that they go through

the five year [one] [ah] is one that you can consider <malay>cuma</malay> maybe you have to do the toilet [ah]
our is not cement

ya but it it feels nice right
ours is not it looks like cement's grey but it's not
skirting I think is necessary [ah]
ya
(mm) should be okay [lah] ya
that [one] I don't know how they do it but it could be because they customise their wardrobe all that that [one] will take a lot of that [one] quite expensive [lah]
ya true ours actually our renovation company is very good <malay>cuma sekarang dah tak ada lagi</malay> I don't know where they go
<malay>apanya</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] like competition
ya ours <malay>macam</malay> the my sister <malay>punya</malay> is like newer <malay>tapi dorang punya barang macam lagi cepat pecah</malay> ours <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay> the door [kan] <malay>yang dia punya</malay> handle is quite solid but my sister <malay>punya macam kena picit banyak baru dia buka</malay>

[ah] the the
ya and the brand is bosch
supposed to be quite #atas# [hor]

[ah] ya ya <malay>kena macam ada</malay> talk forum
ya okay [lah]
then after a few years you <malay>kena tukar</malay> [kan] ya ours is granite but now got a lot of new new types of counter top my parents is using this thing called vulcan I also just first time I heard of it <malay>masa kita orang pergi</malay> that's why it's like (um) it's
(um) it's a little bit more #atas# than quartz and it can go up to the wall also so the <malay>dia punya tu macam</malay> fulfilling <malay>macam</malay> very #atas# kitchen
ya correct
you you can check it out [lah]
okay [lah] I why they didn't choose quartz that time [oh] cause <malay>kita orang pemalas</malay> they say that granite can withhold heat better than quartz <malay>jadi sebab kita nanti</malay> take the pot <malay>terus letak</malay> on the kitchen counter
#taufik# and I are the <malay>pemalas</malay> kind
granite the good thing is ya [lah] if it can withstand heat all that but the porous I think after awhile it will become porous <malay>pastu</malay> (um) <malay>tak banyak</malay> choices as compared to quartz
they say after a few years you <malay>kena buat</malay> sealing <malay>dia</malay> [lah] but <malay>kita orang tak pernah buat</malay> <malay>abeh nampak macam</malay> still okay <malay>apa takyah</malay> [lah] <malay>malas</malay> ya

ya
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] ya I mean I would prefer at #jurong# [lah] cause you got more food choices I mean it's not like I'm working there still but the lakeside apparently it's supposed to be <malay>macam dekat dengan</malay> water feature <malay>entah</malay> [lah] but [oh] they said after that (err) they say that in the twenty twenties they will start breaking the ground (err) ya
until now I don't see any breaking the ground

<malay>apa</malay> [jer] !aduh! well that's #jurong# for you <malay>tapi</malay> #jurong# <malay>punya rumah mahal</malay>
that's why after the news came out then the price went up and then news <malay>kata</malay> that they will no longer do the the price went down again then now might be up again so the price went up again so it all depends whether the is <malay>ada ke tidak</malay>

yes last resort (mm)
I I enjoy teaching when I was like at the science centre
ya there's no stress they enjoy the kids really enjoy what they are doing because for them they are doing experiment [kan] so they don't see it as something that is examinable so they really enjoy what they are learning so I I wanted to find that kind of thing [lah] but imagine teaching the same thing over and over for like seven years
what's that ya for the seven years I <malay>dah tak boleh tahan</malay> [ah] at least this [one] it's a bit different
better to do different different things then my brain <malay>pun tak mendak sangat</malay>
ya to the point where I sometimes will just blurt out whatever is the teaching content without registry registering in my brain
yes correct <malay>dah hafal sangat</malay>
(mm)
I <malay>tak pernah buat</malay> tuition like
[oh] maybe I just don't handle stress well
[ah] like you have that where you must make sure the kid improve
okay I think I hear too much stories about the second [one] so I got like a bit scared of
ya I teach my mendaki kids before and they were super sweet
[oh] dear actually why they why <malay>madrasah tak ambil</malay> like the (err) trained teachers [ah]
like now they are together under and so by right when they take teachers also they should take those under and they are not fit so that that [one] I you know [lah]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] I'm not too sure
and my sis <malay>nak hantar</malay> my niece <malay>masuk madrasah</malay> [tau]

they have been trained
(mm) so don't know [lah] cause I think my my sis just that she's working in a school ya now also I think she see the school environment she get like a bit scared so <malay>dia kata takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>dia nak hantar</malay> the my niece <malay>pergi masuk madrasah</malay> so let's see how it goes anyway <malay>baru</malay> two years old [seh]
ya amazing
ya <malay>asalkan</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> education you know you get your your cert this that you can use to find a job that's good enough but these people they really <malay>macam</malay> plan out everything for their children
I don't know what kind of parent I will be I but I think #taufik# will be very hands on he will bring the kid to the garden make the kid touch all the plants ya make the kid <malay>apa bau</malay> all the plants also ya I can imagine that
<malay>kenapa tak</malay> botanist [seh]
[eh] <malay>dulu</malay> I <malay>kecil-kecil</malay> [kan] I don't know whether I got tell you before I wanted to be a farmer
[oh] I I really wanted to <malay>jaga</malay> my own <malay>kambing-kambing</malay> like like want to be self-sustainable <malay>gitu</malay> like have my <malay>kambing-kambing</malay> [oh] sheep sheep so I can like (err) <malay>jual dia punya</malay> wool then (um) like <malay>kat</malay> new zealand then <malay>kat</malay> switzerland <malay>ke</malay> then like <malay>macam ada</malay> a small muslim community there so I <malay>boleh buatkan korban</malay> [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> their

bro <malay>aku</malay> #frus# [ah] bro
what happened did you watch the game last week the okay okay okay okay okay okay fine I watch the man U game and I also watch liverpool game <malay>aku punya bingit</malay> which man U game the one with crystal palace [ah]
ya (err)
K K K admittedly <malay>macam macam budak-budak</malay> [ah] <malay>macam main dengan</malay> boy look look at look at #wilfried# freaking #zaha# what he what he did to us and what he could have been for us but no thanks to
no thanks to david #moyes# we sold him back to crystal palace and look bit us back (um) bit our hand back
<malay>geram</malay> [seh] then then and then this whole freaking transfer window where we are talking about #gareth bale# and #sergio aguero# and and #thiago#
and you associated with all of them
but [oh] look <malay>dia pun</malay> sign the only work
the like one of the two world class players available
for like twenty five million and we bought harry maguire for eighteen million
ya [ah] the the cause
what what what did he say cause he doesn't know enough about #thiago# he doesn't know enough about a person who's playing in #barcelona# central midfield who's playing the champions league week in week out
and he says he doesn't know and this guy says he has a bunker iPad bunker with a full football knowledge database <malay>pakai</malay> football manager <malay>semak</malay>
I can't believe [sia]
david #moyes# <malay>kat mana dia baru lawan</malay> #arteta# last week
he fought against his captain and he lost
west ham [a'ah]
when did they ever not lost okay [ah] to be honest I don't care about the other fish in the ocean [ah] but but the west ham game was interesting for me cause I just wanted to see how
#arteta#
plus minus [ah] plus minus [ah]
[eh] but but honestly speaking I think liverpool gonna <malay>angkat</malay> again [ah] the <malay>korang punya</malay> the only thing you all needed was that was exactly that that guy in the middle who can keep things simple and can also do the spectacular #thiago#
<malay>dia punya</malay>
he knows his a level above everybody else [ah] no but but K you know there's this two theories of
(err) two types of players football theory [eh] two types of players one is the control player one is the chaos player and then there's in in amongst the current modern managers [kan]
[ah] the likes of
#guardiola#
and #pochettino# and #martinez# and and brendan rodgers they come from the louis #van gaal# [ah] #ajax# school of control at where
okay if I could if I could describe it this way louis #van gaal# is a scientist in in in that sense cause
ya no but (err) no you had you have to look beyond the partisanship let's just look at it from academic perspective [ah] okay (err)
he treats everything as available you control all the rest then you can tweak the variable and you can manipulate the variables no
so his main code word is control that's why when he breaks up the training he breaks up into the unit meetings or defence unit meetings midfield unit meetings attacking unit meetings and all of the eleventh place at any one point only three players are allowed to be creative the rest all control players
okay so the more variable you can control the more you can dominate the opponent [ah]
he does basically [ah]
there's no such thing as chance okay there's no such thing as chance chance happens cause you allow it to happen [ah] in other words so this kind that's that's why the possession thing cause me to play hard though if you have the ball the opponents have the ball it's the school louis #van gaal# school of control
wait then then I have the flip side [ah] the flip side is you eden clock eden clock
is the direct opposite of that he okay usually #merino# takes everything that is strong about louis #van gaal# and finds the witnesses so like louis #van gaal# takes
the ball without the ball you cannot do anything correct if you have the ball the opponent cannot score and we shift the opponent around cause they have to keep chasing after the ball
using #merino# flips that upon his head he controlled the ball he controls the match without the ball so he push them into different parts of the pitch which are harmless so that's the typical people have possession you always have to keep the horseshoe U-shape thing [ah]
from passing from right to left left to right cause you can break through the middle so that's how josie monaco dominates without the ball like the #barcelona# against #inter milan# <malay>punya</malay> game [ah] #barcelona# [ah] [eh] sorry (um)
bionic #inter milan# game where they only had seventy eighty percent possession and but #inter milan# won three main
reject the balls
correct he actively gets rid of the ball cause he his theory is (err)
the the one who wins the match is the one who makes the most the one who lose the match the one who makes the most mistake and the one who has the ball makes the most mistake that's #mourinho#
correct so basically people control the ball and he play a low block
the moment they make mistake there's miles and miles of space out there then he go on the counter break he has been quoted saying it's the person who does not make use of the counter attack is stupid cause it's a very powerful tool okay
that is still within the control manager kind of thing
same school but two sides of the coin [ah]
clock is totally different clock is from the chaos school of mentality the control player will be like someone like michael kerrick #zambia lonso#
(err) (err) schools that kind of control #zavi iniesta# chaos player
I the chaos manager is is what clock came from his school he doesn't #van gaal# doesn't like instincts that's why he always takes people he always tell people take one one step of the ball control the ball then shoot you will berate anyone <malay>yang terus</malay> shoot the ball [tau]
okay so cause he wants the control he's
players would act on instinct he cannot trust okay so (err) he wants them to think and get it repetitions so become muscle memory okay but clock he wants instinct that's exactly reason why #van gaal# and #cryuff# although there are come from the same school they're very different cause
#cryuff# emphasise more on individual creativity #van gaal# is strictly team organised by team
clock from the chaos part
he wants passion he wants instinct cause he believes that people at their best when they're in the zone when they're full blood rush rush to the head they have the extra ten per cent edge over the rest they have that ten percent inspiration overdress so
just whack and and
in football team the teams are in the weakest in the transition period so when the first phase second phase third phase forth phase
correct there's a transition period and that is that's when you lose your shape and you have not enough time to recover back into a different transition so that is
what #mourinho# exploits that is what clock clock exploits except that clock
pushes that to the limit he wants that to happen all the time that's why the high pressing
[ah] basically he wants the bag for of the opponent to <malay>kelam kabut</malay> he lose the ball there
then the distance travelled to the goal is very little okay so that's why he push up very high where but the distance is little but then you have less space to manoeuvre [ah] #mourinho# he lived the gap behind more space to manoeuvre more space to exploit
ya but #klopp# he he demands the intensity and that <malay>kelam kabut</malay>
opposites outside of the spectrum for one #klopp#
he
#klopp# denies his space
yes
correct for
swan
[oh] sun sun sun sun sun sun sun [ah] whatever [lah] <malay>melayu</malay> swan <malay>melayu</malay>

movies
okay
okay okay talking about children [eh]
okay talking about children <malay>aku baru berbual dengan bini aku</malay> a few days ago okay I I don't subscribe to Netflix cause I have an app which can get all netflix movies or shows for free
[eh] you fall you know it could be a someone sign for me up an account so anyway (err)

[ah] you can install on smart Android box
as long as it's Android it can be installed [ah] in other words whatever the physical shape
it's an [ah]
okay so <malay>bini aku</malay> past few days we're talking about this she mentioned this Netflix thing [tau] about how
(uh) in the last week or last few days <malay>alih-alih macam</malay>
their reporting
(err) people who are un-subscribing from Netflix are at an all time high
[ah] or
yes cause of the cuties it's cause (err) (err)
cause they're controversy people are boycotting cuties and <malay>apa</malay> okay [ah] to
quote yahoo news or something it's it's at a multi year high the level of substitution cause of this duties thing [ah] and <malay>kau kau tahu</malay> the controversy behind it
okay
alright so on on the surface level [eh] on the surface level is like [ah]
this de-sexualisation of minors [kan] <malay>selalunya</malay> I would say [kan] <malay>syaiton</malay> slowly <malay>syaiton</malay> is slowly inserting his influence on these things [ah]
desensitising us to sexualisation so
but (err) you know I I didn't even look trailer I just look at the freaking post and yell what the heck you don't even they are twins <malay>budak-budak ni</malay> they are just
ten eleven years old [kan]
eleven years old not wearing [ah] so
ya it's like in other words it's like my
it's my niece [ah] ones from that age right now so I feel it's freaking sick and you you it's creepy when you detach yourself from that film but into the real world [tau] <malay>kau</malay> imagine [eh] the fact that
they are kids and the fact that are adults who actually suggesting these two kids [ah] and the fact that the kids have parents who agree for them to be dressed like this and act in something like this the fact their parents allow them to act and wear things like this being surrounded by adults
who are videographers cameraman directors and all the extra films on set all the extra on set
and these kids are growing up and thinking this is normal they might even enjoy the attention in real world consequences [eh]
and then you have the goal of the director <malay>nama dia macam</malay> sounds a muslim #maimunah# the cold or something <malay>dia dia dia macam</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] ya [lah] one of the subject people from france <malay>punya</malay> territories [ah]
but ya from breaking free from the traditions of senegal <malay>ini</malay> [kan] but that's that's the thing she she's justifying it by saying like [oh] it's a coming of
age story about breaking free from tradition and going against the patriarchy or against oppressive culture that kind of thing [lah] that's the justification [ah] so she said you're looking at the superficial thing but you're not looking at the message by the film
philosophical question does the end justify the means if that is your message but in the message you are actually causing some people some children real world [ah] mental or psychological damage by getting to dress like this in order to act a character like that in behaving in front of people
<malay>aku nak tahu ni</malay> who who who was there even a was there a casting couch for this thing who's the person who who vetted through all this girls and look through <malay>budak-budak sebelas tahun macam</malay>
it's not a sleazy casting call [ah]
(mm) (mm)
kevin spacey serious

he's inherently not a bad person he wants to be a good person he just can't help himself [ah] [ah] to take shortcuts and corners like that but the transition from
being jimmy to
saul goodman and the point in time when say screw this I just want to embrace who I am [kan] (uh) we still holding up a from certain point of views you ask
he's not wrong per se which is not legally wrong <malay>tapi</malay> is
morally ambiguous [ah] but but but ya that that transition to its when when it starts to get really engaging [tau] when you put yourself in and ask yourself
<malay>aku rasa</malay> three [ah] three three to four [ah] then (um)
then you see how brothers three each other and everything [ah] so <malay>kau dah tengok dia punya abang</malay> treat <malay>dia macam mana</malay>

[ah]
okay [lah] <malay>penat juga</malay> [lah] but <malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah]
<malay>tadi</malay> a bit fun [lah] okay so
okay let's find
okay
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
really that's not that petty
okay
I think okay [lah] that's that's not that petty I suppose for me if
petty a petty reason for me to dislike someone would definitely be his his or her <malay>punya</malay> (um)
(uh) the
[oh] the person's friends the or who the person hangs out with
like that's usually how I would end up not not liking a person is is damn petty
but (uh) it's usually how who they choose to hang out with which is very shallow [lah] but
I suppose (um) ya
ya
okay
okay [lah] okay okay okay <malay>kalau</malay> say <malay>kalau</malay> say <malay>orang tu nak</malay> hang out <malay>dengan</malay> I right <malay>tapi dia macam</malay>
<malay>kirakan</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tak macam kawan dia</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tak dengan</malay> members <malay>dia semua</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
but
still at the back of my mind (um)
I would I will be too aware of it
and it would definitely affect (um) you know the person just because of who their friends are
it judgemental it's not it's not even petty anymore it's it's more
it's more petty is more is more judgemental than petty so
ya it will be difficult [lah] and like and it's it I I know it's it's very sad but yes
ya okay
(uh)
[ha] okay
<malay>apakah</malay> okay wait wait wait
<malay>ceritakan suatu pengalaman yang sebenarnya lucu tetapi mungkin tidak lucu pada masa itu</malay>

and <malay>buang seluar dalam</malay>
<malay>kat mana ni</malay>

(uh huh)
(uh huh)
!huh! okay
(uh) <malay>cerita kelakar</malay>
okay actually you know what
you know what I'm gonna do right now I don't wanna talk about I don't want to use this conversation
I wanna talk about something I want to talk about the house
ya okay it's easier for us let's just
what do you think of the house [ah]
!huh!
ya ya what do think of the house [ah]
(mmhmm)
keep talking [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I mean for me ya [lah] I mean it's I do feel
I mean once in a while like I do feel <malay>macam</malay> a bit <malay>sedih</malay> that
<malay>yang apa ni</malay>
I
I'm a bit far away from from where I'm used to [kan] like I mean like I've always been living in #yishun#
and then now moving to #tampines# so it's a bit
it's a bit different for me [lah] ya
but I guess it's okay
it's fine
one thing about the house that I really I mean do I do I really love is the fact that it's very
us you know
it's something that we both
initially I had no idea that that you were gonna be okay with the designs
you know what I propose for because it was what I like
you know anything I'm just very lucky that like what I like was what was what you like as well
right
I mean certain things you like a bit <malay>sedih</malay> right you know we didn't get to have (um)
for example like I wanted more
more carpentry stuff in the living room you know what that that that whole feature wall thing
but you know it's just too expensive
ya it's just <malay>mahal</malay> [lah]
(mm)
ya
ya [lah]
ya
your your your your new phone <malay>masih banyak</malay> battery [kan]
you just get <malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
(uh) okay you know what I'm gonna go back to the questions [lah] it was a bit it was kind of slightly easier just now
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
(uh huh)
(uh) first one would definitely be wealth
right I want to be not just for me but my entire family you know like want to be
a family that has a lot of wealth property
you know (uh) really high net worth you know a dynasty a business
where our wealth would just go roll and roll and roll
you know that would last generation upon generations
right not just my family but your family as well like like really rich and powerful family that's the that's the first one mine is quite grand [lah]
and then the second
would be obviously
[oh] but back to the first one like the like the wealth that we that we gain is of legal means right in that we are free from any legal trouble
secondly is definitely to have
health
(hmm)
(mm)
will be health <malay>nanti</malay> [lah]
like would be health
(um) you know basically virus free
you know strong right perfect bodies
(uh) and then the third one right
that you know same sex relationship is not a problem at all
so you can basically live together you know
(um)
ya [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [jer] [ah]

<malay>entah</malay> [eh] <malay>tak tahu nak berbual apa lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>jap jap jap</malay> [eh] I <malay>tangok yang tu</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] (oo) they got a lot of question
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
(uh huh)
I think
for me it's the built
first
right I'm okay with looks
ya
I mean I mean of course [lah] it has to be attractive in my way [lah]
right ya
I like the physical appeal first right and then the face
(hmm) and you know the person's kind of vibe [ah] not not not personality or character [lah] because I think that's just a stretch
ya
there's too much to think about the but there has to be like some sort like I'm I'm attracted to I guess to to many kinds of personalities and characters but
you know it's that person's vibe can I
deal with like you know you and I we have very different personalities
right we have quite a opposing personalities and we are quite and we're very very different people but
you know the fact that we actually can
we do have a certain chemistry
I mean we do have chemistry with each other and we we vibe well [ah]
ya
is this is actually very difficult
like this conversation thing to code switch is actually very difficult like I find myself like when I'm very conscious of what I'm speaking that I'm speaking I tend to break out more I mean it it's very natural for me to speak in english
like for me to like suddenly like <malay>tukar</malay> and then <malay>cakap bahasa melayu</malay>
you know <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] but
you know it's not normal it's just not natural for me to be speaking malay all the way <malay>nak cakap melayu</malay> all the way because
even when I'm speaking malay
normally I suppose right I
I often pepper the words with
pepper the sentences with with with english words because sometimes it's just so much easier to express something in english
you know ya because
ya like the word
like for example like to say to express feeling
right is it feels much easier and it feels less awkward
you know than to say the phrase <malay>luahkan perasaan</malay>
ya it just feels much easier it just feels less emotional
you know like <malay>luahkan perasaan</malay> means like I'm about to cry you know like I'm about to
I'm about to really go deep
with my feelings but when I say I'm expressing like I just want to express my thought it can be blunt it can be quick it can be fast you know but when I say I <malay>nak luahkan perasaan kat</malay> you [ah]
<malay>maknanya</malay> I <malay>macam ada banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cakap sangat</malay> [kan] <malay>ada banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>nak nak nak kena nak kena fikirkan nak kena</malay> (uh)
<malay>nak kena fikirkan nak kena luahkan nak kena</malay>
<malay>nak kena cakap</malay> [lah]
then <malay>rasa dia macam</malay> <malay>macam berat sangat</malay>
<malay>macam kelakar pun ada macam janggal</malay> !wah! see
<malay>janggal</malay>
you you <malay>tak tahu makna janggal</malay> you <malay>teka makna janggal apa</malay>

okay I'm I'm actually going to attempt to speak malay in this [ah] okay <malay>kemahiran yang pertama yang yang ingin saya</malay>
<malay>yang ingin saya</malay> [oh] my god what is that thing
[eh] <malay>mana dia</malay>
[eh] <malay>jap jap jap jap kemahiran yang pertama ialah</malay>
<malay>kemahiran yang pertama ialah</malay> [eh] <malay>mana tadi dia</malay>
okay <malay>kemahiran yang pertama ialah</malay> (um)
okay okay <malay>kemahiran yang pertama yang ingin saya meraih adalah</malay>
(uh)

and I I think those three skills would be
most
(uh) would be most useful
I believe
okay
okay
okay <malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay so that's question okay so let's look at another prompter
you are dining at a new restaurant called karma it doesn't have a menu you simply get what you deserve
what food will you be served
okay okay that's a dumb question (um)
<malay>suatu hari</malay>
<malay>anda bangun dari tidur dan mendapati bahawa anda telah menjadi seorang pelakon</malay>
<malay>siapakah pelakon itu dan mengapa anda memilihnya</malay>
okay
<malay>pelakon</malay>
<malay>yang saya</malay>
(um) <malay>memilih</malay>
[ah] <malay>ialah</malay>
(uh)
(uh)
<malay>siapa yang jadi</malay> spiderman <malay>yang barunya yang</malay> the latest one tom holland ya
<malay>saya ingin menjadi</malay> tom holland <malay>kerana</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia</malay>
(uh) <malay>sungguh</malay> (um)
(uh) talented
I have no idea what talented means (uh) is in in in malay (um)
that <malay>dia muda</malay>
<malay>saya ingin menjadi muda kembali</malay>
(uh)
<malay>muda dan</malay> (uh) <malay>berjaya</malay>
ya tom holland
<malay>bagaimana pula dengan anda</malay>
<malay>pilihan</malay>
<malay>kenapa</malay>
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(uh huh)
actually
(uh huh)
okay <malay>kejap jap jap</malay>
okay (um)
[eh] <malay>jap jap</malay> you know what I want to <malay>tengok</malay> the video <malay>yang</malay> your brother <malay>hantar</malay>
then <malay>kejap</malay> [eh]
ya <malay>satu jam kena berbual satu jam</malay>
just <malay>berbual</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>satu jam</malay> the no okay the thing is I think what the
I think what this exercise is is trying to trying to
study is how like when you're having a conversation how do we code switch right
because you know we are both singaporeans we both speak the same languages right (um) how
the mastery level
you know our mastery level at the language at at the language is is completely secondary
you know so I think they just want to find out like
I think I think the whole purpose of this is trying to find like is trying to figure out the trigger points
right
and actually collect data
as to when
what like what are the patterns when it comes to code switching like you know like right now I'm speaking in english and then suddenly I <malay>tukar</malay> I <malay>cakap dengan</malay> you <malay>bahasa melayu</malay>
I think <malay>saya rasa diorang nak tahu kenapa bagaimana apabila</malay>
<malay>yang paling mustahak ialah apabila</malay>
<malay>dan kenapa</malay>
<malay>dan dari situ</malay>
(um)
<malay>memberi</malay> (uh)
<malay>kesinambungan</malay>
<malay>bagaimana</malay>
<malay>dan apabila</malay>
(uh) <malay>diorang diorang ingin</malay> (um)
<malay>diorang ingin mengetahui</malay>
<malay>cara-cara</malay>
code switching
ya because
sometimes okay sometimes okay what I find such studies very interesting because they like
such research very interesting
when
no no no you have to you have to you have to understand because
they have to list like an entire conversation right if if we were to speak fifteen minutes there's not enough data there's they can't really detect you know like enough patterns
right if it's just
fifteen seconds it can be a brief conversation you know it's
when you speak to someone for an hour okay yes a force could (um) not force it's a bit forced I get you you know is one hour it's a bit forced
right but it's okay
it's okay
ya
it's okay and but the thing is it's I think they just want to see patterns
you know they want to see patterns and if one hour I suppose give them ample (um) opportunities to mine
you know as much as as much data as they can
ya
the difficulty in us maintaining in this is is actually in in in is actually the maintaining of this conversation
right and consciously trying to code switch
when in normal situation
it's something that we do unconsciously
right we just do it and that it's it's something that we don't really think about our
be be even aware of
you know like
(um)
like when we are with our friends you know then when we talk
when we talk <malay>ni semua</malay> we don't really
I mean we don't really think about and then we just we we either just continue what we're saying in malay or we just continue what we're saying in english you know
I think the difficult part is that whole start stop thing and the fact that they made us watch this video
right
they made a number of us watch this video and then they kinda give guidelines
as to how I hope you're listening to this by the way and they give us guidelines on how to
(um)
on what makes a good code switching or bad code switching and that kinds of kind of like
you know (uh) make us a bit too conscious so I feel that this conversation feels a bit forced and to a certain and to a certain degree (uh) unnatural
you know
I feel that if there was no not much of restriction
right if there was not much restriction where I can just easily go in go out <malay>nak cakap melayu cakap melayu nak cakap</malay> english <malay>cakap</malay> english
and
then <malay>cakap</malay> [lah] but the fact that <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> certain words <malay>macam</malay> like there's a like there's a rule to it
right it's just very it just like <malay>macam</malay> !alah!
ya
ya <malay>macam dia macam tak</malay> natural but okay [lah] not bad
we actually made it to forty minutes you know
ya yes <malay>lagi dua puluh minit sahaja</malay> okay <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> I <malay>nak tengok yang</malay> the video <malay>yang</malay> your your brother <malay>hantar tu</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay cleaning done !wah!
okay [lah] I'm glad that they that the <malay>yang</malay> [kan] initially [kan] our flooring we wanted like two different colours
actually I'm kinda glad that
the other colour
ya
<malay>nasib baik tu yang benda tu</malay> ya [lah] <malay>dah habis</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay>
ya
then when we only pick one
so glad we pick the the nicer the the darker one because it's actually much nicer
ya <malay>rumah kita besar</malay> [sia]
yes
[a'ah] <malay>macam lama</malay> [sia]
no [lah] I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> first first christmas
to fully <malay>pindah</malay> but I mean we can slowly live there
my things I'm gonna <malay>letak sikit-sikit</malay> [tau] I'm not gonna like one time go there I'm just gonna put things bit by bit because I <malay>takde kotak</malay>
I probably gonna take a few <malay>kotak</malay> and all that for of course office
<malay>muat ke</malay>
[oh] <malay>cakap</malay> [jer] [lah] ya
I really <malay>suka</malay> the <malay>yang kitanya</malay> flooring flooring <malay>kita cantik</malay>
ya
[ah] [oh]
<malay>yang yang kerusi belakang tu kena</malay> screw [kan]
ya [lah] <malay>semua</malay> [ah] <malay>semua kena buat</malay> [ah]
if <malay>ikat</malay> [ah]
<malay>macam kelakar</malay> [eh] <malay>takde</malay> <malay>kat dalam bilik ni</malay> [eh]
[ah] [sia] <malay>besar</malay> [seh]
I mean <malay>kita boleh pergi</malay> later
we can go later we can go tomorrow
!wah! [eh] the counter <malay>tak cantik</malay> [ah]
yup
no [lah] <malay>kita kena kena kena letak dulu</malay> [pe] [oh] <malay>takleh</malay> [eh]
okay so okay
!ee! best [lah] I <malay>tengok</malay> I I I <malay>tengok</malay> the kitchen best [seh] <malay>jap jap jap</malay> [eh]
I think the kitchen <malay>cantik</malay> [ah] like after we <malay>letak</malay> after the <malay>apa ni</malay> the
<malay>dia</malay>
ya
after <malay>dia letak</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap jap</malay>
I think the whole idea <malay>yang</malay> [ah] you know to level up the floor is such a damn good idea
I kinda like it though
<malay>ye ke</malay>
it kinda looks more like (uh) rustic to me
[eh] <malay>ini diorang boleh</malay> spray [eh]
okay
so <malay>yang ni nanti nanti</malay> next few days <malay>baru pasang</malay> [ah]
<malay>kena tunggu benda tu kering</malay> [eh]
actually [kan]
I was imagining the the counter top to be
<malay>besar sikit</malay> [tau] <malay>tebal sikit</malay> actually quite thin [ah]
if you tell me I'm not saying it's not okay it's okay obviously it's okay but I was imagining it to be thinner
[eh] thicker
ya <malay>lebih tebal sikit</malay>
<malay>tapi macam tak</malay> [jer]
ya okay let's let's look at another question it's quite interesting like suddenly [ah]
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
if were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be [ah] <malay>ni ni</malay> <malay>ni ni soalan</malay> best
no no no one dish
ya
yes
okay
just like you
I have two choices
<malay>pilihan pertama</malay>
<malay>adalah satay</malay>
<malay>satay lembu</malay>
<malay>dua puluh lima cucuk</malay>
(uh) <malay>ketupat sikit</malay>
<malay>tapi kuah satay banyak-banyak banyak letak banyak bawang banyak</malay>
(um)
<malay>banyak bawang</malay> and <malay>banyak timun</malay>
(uh)
ya <malay>dua puluh lima cucuk</malay>
I can eat that I think for every single meal
<malay>pilihan kedua</malay>
<malay>seperti anda</malay>
<malay>adalah nasi sambal goreng</malay>
<malay>nasi sambal goreng adalah hidangan</malay>
<malay>yang lengkap</malay>
<malay>dia manis dia pedas ada masin</malay>
you know
<malay>dia lengkap</malay>
<malay>nasi sambal goreng</malay> is what I would call a perfect meal
it is such a perfect meal it is not a balanced meal
but it is a perfect meal
you know it is one of the my most favourite things in the world
okay

ya
which I don't think so
I sincerely don't think so [lah] seriously don't think that it's gonna be
just take a look
ya ya ya we wanna change ya we wanna change in february
february is soon by the way
should die ya actually <malay>ni cantik</malay> [eh]
actually even this [one] <malay>dekat letak dekat apa ni</malay> the dining are <malay>pun cantik</malay> [ah]
<malay>cantiknya</malay>
[ah]
this is so <malay>cantik</malay>
[eh] <malay>cepat</malay> [lah] <malay>babi</malay> [ah]
!wah!

alright alright
<malay>tak apa</malay> I think for now <malay>kita kena</malay> (err) try our best to talk to fill in the one hour ahead
yes okay so <malay>apa yang</malay> #sulaiman# Twitter <malay>macam mana nak</malay> start
okay so basically <malay>sejak dulu</malay> I've always wanted to go to the kampung <malay>nak</malay> stay the night <malay>tapi</malay> #sulaiman# <malay>dah ajak</malay> so <malay>tak dapat tidur</malay> overnight <malay>cuma setakat gi mancing</malay> overnight then <malay>aku ni</malay> expert <malay>pergi sana</malay> without any proper clothing
and (uh) the the <malay>dah jadi mangsa</malay> to all these sandflies that's why right now you can see that I'm wearing all these sleeves to cover my <malay>aurat</malay>
(err) I went to the one that is nearer to to #sulaiman's# house <malay>juga</malay> [lah] it's it's just a
few walks away so it's not really much of a big distance for us to cover
<malay>kalau</malay> jetty <malay>tu jauh</malay> jetty <malay>tu</malay> is really quite a distance this [one] is <malay>yang kat belakang kampung</malay> you'll be able to walk to this particular part of the beach then <malay>kat sana kita gi</malay> cast our rods [lah]
no that time was all the way to #jelutong# that [one] is all the way at the other end of the island <malay>yang ni betul-betul kat belakang kampung melayu</malay>
<malay>tak tahu orang melayu</malay> [kan]
ya the kampung with the malays ya that place
okay you need a best part (err) <malay>banyak petuk tapi</malay> is just <malay>yang ikan yang aku tunjuk tu</malay> [ah] <malay>yang ikan tudung periuk</malay>
or in english we say the spotted sequel fish ya <malay>tapi ikan tu</malay> the story <malay>lagi</malay> best
<malay>aku dah mancing aku sengaja</malay> feel <malay>nak</malay> reel in <malay>tapi bila dah dapat</malay> [eh] <malay>tiba-tiba ganas betul-betul kau dapat rasa lawan bila kita dah angkat aku panggil</malay> #sulaiman# to come and check then all of a sudden <malay>kita tengok kat dalam dia punya mata kail</malay> [kan] <malay>betul-betul sangkut kat hidung</malay>
<malay>betul-betul</malay> on the nose
then the rest of the night <malay>tak ada ikan</malay>
<malay>betul-betul potong</malay>
<malay>kita jumpa dekat</malay> singapore so the the <malay>asal</malay> before <malay>kita jumpa sekeluarga</malay>
then <malay>dia datang naik</malay> grab <malay>bila dia</malay> claw grab <malay>ingat dia keluar gi bazaar ke apa</malay>
<malay>betul-betul keluar barang</malay> one by one <malay>ada</malay> claw back trolley <malay>besar satu bakul satu</malay> (err) <malay>bawa langsir</malay>
<malay>nak tukar langsir dekat dalam rumah dia</malay> then actually the next day more fun <malay>keluarga dia datang</malay> the next day <malay>dia nya</malay> extended relatives [lah] <malay>dia datang bawa tiga</malay>
no [lah] I think for them maybe is about
connections [lah] <malay>kalau sebab kalau sulaimannya</malay> family <malay>yang dia punya</malay> extended family <malay>ni memang satu orang tu</malay> driver so <malay>kalau</malay> coincidentally <malay>dia dapat</malay> arrange with the driver <malay>senang</malay> [lah] <malay>tak payah bayar tambang</malay> free of charge
okay so <malay>kita dah sampai kampung</malay> #sulaiman# get everything ready six o'clock then <malay>salin baju semua</malay>
(err) that's what made me worried [lah] <malay>tengok dia dah pakai</malay> all full suit but I have nothing like am I supposed to prepare something on my end then <malay>terus</malay>
initially no intention <malay>tapi bila dah nampak</malay> #sulaiman# <malay>keluarkan joran tu</malay> the intention came out [lah]
okay so six get already then after that we (err)
six twenty five <malay>kita gerak</malay> then from there <malay>kita jalan</malay> all the way to that spot
(err) until six thirty five then
we we actually walk all the way to this part of the dam ya actually <malay>macam</malay> where you get all the <malay>air keluar masuk</malay> then <malay>bila air pasang semua macam</malay> marina barrage [lah] and then you get on top of the stone then #sulaiman# <malay>cakap</malay> #wan# (err) <malay>ni</malay> part <malay>gerek</malay> [tau] <malay>bila</malay> high tide <malay>kita tak boleh keluar</malay> [tau]
<malay>kau kau nak tak abeh aku cakap</malay> go [jer] [ah] don't scared then <malay>betul-betul bila</malay> high tide [eh] <malay>terus</malay> #sulaiman# pointed at me #wan# <malay>tengok terus kita dah</malay> surrounded <malay>kiri kanan air pasang besar</malay>
then at first <malay>macam mula-mula tak boleh</malay> understand [lah] like the the depth of the <malay>air tapi bila air surut</malay>
once you see that low tide <malay>dia punya</malay> drop from the top of the dam to the bottom <malay>seram</malay> [sia] <malay>dua dua tingkat</malay> yes
so <malay>macam dari jauh tak nampak tapi betul-betul</malay> because of that that (err) concrete structure <malay>bila dah air tumpah bawah jatuh dalam</malay> [seh]
yes
ya so basically <malay>macam</malay> this man-made structure is like very far away from the beach so there's this path <malay>yang kita kena jalan atas</malay>
then (err) <malay>ada</malay> from there is like a hill downwards [lah] so from there <malay>ada</malay> slope to (err) to <malay>bakau-bakau sini</malay> and after that we had to climb on certain bricks to get onto the structure so <malay>bila air pasang</malay>
the whole valley below <malay>semua ni semua</malay> covered so it's just us on this on this structure
so that time I think lucky [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> I think the tide was supposed to be three metres plus then the highest [eh]
<malay>betul-betul macam sini</malay> [tau] then <malay>dia cakap man kalau</malay> get any higher how <malay>aku cakap macam tu</malay> [lah] #wan#
<malay>takde</malay> there's no is open is basically your marina barrage bridge is basically the same logic as that thing
I think next time you go there confirm <malay>kau try juga</malay> high tide got stranded for like we were stranded for I think a good six hours six hours (err) because
<malay>air naik pasang baru pukul sepuluh</malay> but the coast too low then after that we were there until
<malay>pukul empat pukul empat dia dah naik sepuluh malam</malay> ya then after that <malay>pukul satu</malay>
<malay>tu apa</malay> was the highest then after that <malay>betul-betul tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>kita</malay> literally [sia]
<malay>macam</malay> tsunami <malay>betul-betul tengok bila air pasang air surut ombak dari luar masuk dalam</malay>
<malay>tak juga</malay> okay <malay>itu</malay> best okay this part censored <malay>sikit</malay> <malay>bila nak kencing kita ada satu</malay> spot
<malay>satu</malay> spot on the whole man-made structure <malay>kita</malay> technically I will consider this <malay>macam</malay> the north eastern part of it
away from the <malay>laut tapi</malay> towards the kampung
<malay>habis tu ada</malay> [lah] <malay>tengah</malay> #rilek# <malay>terus dengar ada kat belakang</malay> what what's that noise <malay>jangan pandang belakang</malay> [oh]
censored ya so #sulaiman# was there to pee [lah] then after that (err) not long after that [lah] my turn my turn because for us there's nothing much to do so all we do is go up there
drink lots of water so #sulaiman# will have a sweeter taste because he
drank lemon tea I I brought my dasani and then we just drink drink drink and for #sulaiman# he only peed once I peed
two three times because there's nothing much to do but #sulaiman# what he did most was he he <malay>makan</malay> some Pringles [lah]
enjoy the enjoy
okay so #sulaiman# <malay>dia dia tunjuk</malay> something this [one] is about #naz# <malay>yang</malay> recommend
<malay>dia ada satu</malay> backpack <malay>ni dia jadi tempat duduk</malay>
<malay>kirakan macam</malay> backpack <malay>punya</malay> the the sponge <malay>tu dia punya</malay> padding you can actually convert into a seat then after that #sulaiman# just <malay>duduk</malay> [jer] <malay>atas</malay>
but for my end <malay>ini tempat</malay> legend <malay>aku tak ada benda</malay> then (um) #sulaiman# <malay>punya</malay> mum <malay>cakap</malay> #wan# (err) <malay>kau tengok kau belakang ada ke tak</malay>
then I I I find this <malay>yang</malay> the simple basic students <malay>yang lipat yang buka tutup</malay> boat
so it was already like decomposing and then after that I just sat down and then <malay>kita</malay> testing <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>kat kampung tapi bila kita</malay> testing [kan] <malay>mesti nak kena</malay> fragile <malay>sikit tapi bila dah kat laut duduk sekejap aku ingat kayu yang raput tapi</malay> the whole boat collapsed

(mm) (mm) (mm)
#ish# #ish# (mm) (mmhmm) (mmhmm)
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] mine mine I I wear arm sleeves you can't see but it's it's poking through [lah] poking through
#ish# #ish# of course not nice
but okay in terms of <malay>azan</malay> [eh] because this [one] also the same thing happened to me that time when I go with #sulaiman# but the the thing is (uh) not the spot but basically in the <malay>kampung melayu juga</malay> when we are back at home it was <malay>betul-betul subuh</malay> time [lah]
then when I was outside I thought like somebody was you know playing on the radio <malay>azan</malay> or <malay>quran</malay>
but then when I go outside I literally stand in the middle <malay>semua gelap</malay> I just stand in the middle and then I faced towards malaysia [lah] then I can really hear <malay>surau kat sana tengah</malay> playing [eh] <malay>tengah</malay> playing <malay>pula</malay> [eh] <malay>tengah tu</malay> [lah] <malay>tengah</malay> prepare <malay>tengah solat subuh</malay>
then for the first time <malay>macam</malay> the whole <malay>kampung betul-betul</malay> every <malay>subuh</malay> [eh] I think this [one] has to be like every day [ah] everyday in #pulau ubin# <malay>ada</malay> [jer] <malay>quran</malay> playing
so there's always <malay>quran</malay> throughout the whole island <malay>boleh dengar</malay> because <malay>kampung</malay> it's from malaysia [lah] you can hear from malaysia
so that means because because I think probably <malay>memang</malay> isolated then there's nothing to block except the trees then I can only suspect is the <malay>surau</malay> if I'm not mistaken is the <malay>masjid kampung</malay> #pasir puteh#
so white sands literally <malay>dekat</malay> malaysia ya then that <malay>masjid</malay> is when we look at the map
is quite close to by right the side so your area #pulau ketam# should hear it louder than <malay>kampung melayu</malay>
three three testing [ah] sometimes sometimes sometimes testing one two three
and ya [lah] so <malay>yang</malay> okay so <malay>yang</malay> #pulau ketam# is it the one that has this two storey building is that your spot
okay so I'm thinking of another place
I don't know if I've been there you see [ah] (uh huh) [ah]
[oh] the tip okay so for me
the reason I asked about the two storey building is because if you go there you will see the side
so you would be able to see the side of #pulau ketam# from one end to the other so I think your area might be a little further further in [lah] maybe a place I've never been in before [lah]
(oo) that's a distance I think we should I think
I think your end will be closer to #punggol# to already
[orh] !aduh! so okay okay now I remember I think this story many people say before you kayak in front don't don't
<malay>ikan besar</malay>
[oh] here comes the big one and (uh) instructor instructor I cannot move instructor got current
I can't instructor I don't know why I'm moving towards the angler
alright so that's your #pulau ubin# story thank you so almost for sharing
(err) time check this [one] I can say because you say I can say anything it is twenty five minutes in so we are actually (err) after the one third mark
and the ya I don't know if it I think on my end my english is quite a lot [lah] I think your end your malay quite a lot so hopefully can balance a bit [lah] ya
I mean now we can also fix our mistake
[lah] [kan] [lah] [kan] [eh] yeah
okay what else you wanna talk about
my past few months [ah] [ah]
okay so for now the same thing [lah] just keep trying your luck to apply for all these jobs and see which one can can go for (err) I've considered to deliver food
but I think for the time being (err) more of a full time thing should be something I should focus on [lah]
I think slowly [lah] [eh] because we do full time and at least your income is kind of more fixed [lah] I mean I know Grab you will be able to earn more but you need to work more [lah] ya so just (err) pros and cons I think for now really my mindset is to make sure that I can understand what I'm supposed to do
(err) with my life then understand where are what are my interest what are my passion
then work on it work on those skills then #inshallah# when february comes send again this time to all the six autonomous universities to see whichever one is related to sociology or political science
and then just try my luck [lah] then at least in that moment if I already have a full time job I apply I still have a job
then after that (err) it's just whether or not approve or not if approve I #alhamdullilah# I can say okay I'm going to go for my uni thank you for the opportunity bye bye
and then after that that's it [lah] if if if cannot then at least I already have a job then I will just continue till the next application [lah]
(err) !wah! cannot I cannot think that means a lot already [lah]
(err)
okay
so far the the industry I've been I've I've (err) sent for has been
(err) civil service (err) healthcare (err) cleaning (err)
around those [lah] is is just those industries basically industries that if possible avoid phone call [lah]
ya <malay>kenapa</malay> [seh] <malay>mana ada</malay>
<malay>tadi</malay> in the beginning I already say in the beginning in the beginning I already say a lot of malay so that's why right now I am trying my best to try to
<malay>campurkan melayu sikit</malay> with the english but when I try to put in the <malay>melayu</malay> I understand that I hesitate a bit <malay>jadi terkaku</malay> [lah]
<malay>habis bila dah</malay> focused then (err) then all the sentence everywhere
<malay>jadi kita</malay> try our best to not really mix everything [lah] cause that's that's against what they want us to do [pe]
ya [lah] so that's why if I speak malay I english all the way is okay then the rest all malay all together level out fifty fifty
[ah] yes <malay>ada kisahnya</malay> all
the rejection is the best part [ah] silence which is the most annoying part because technically [eh] by right the most professional way for is
<malay>kalau dapat ke tak dapat bilang</malay> [jer] [lah] but instead you just keep the okay one of the things this [one] I can say [lah] because I think one month <malay>dah</malay> over <malay>pun</malay>
(err) I applied for this (err) safe distancing (err) ambassador at <malay>masjid</malay> #omar salmah#
at caldecott area there (err) more of central macritchie [lah] macritchie reservoir [ah] so it's there
so that [one] is the I think to me is the most saddest because it is the most <malay>yang kasi harapan</malay> because
when they called me I was at Sheng Siong and and then my they called the worst time cause I was supposed to pay but then they called me and then I answered the phone and my mum <malay>terpinga-pinga</malay> [lah] <malay>macam ni nak bayar ni</malay>
ya ya then for me I was (err) I just answer the call then <malay>cakap</malay> hi (err) #assalamualaikum# (err) (err) is this #shazwan# on the line
then I <malay>cakap</malay> [ah] yes may I know who is this <malay>dia cakap</malay> [oh] I am from <malay>masjid</malay> #muhajirin# <malay>mula-mula aku fikir aku</malay> apply <malay>masjid</malay> #omar salmah# <malay>asal</malay> why is it <malay>yang masjid</malay> #muhajirin# <malay>yang</malay> call
then I realise [ah] because (err) this thing is by right <malay>ada</malay> #muhajirin# but they need someone to (err) cover #omar salmah# so they called me everything then they asked to clarify certain parts of my resume
then <malay>aku</malay> explain to them [lah] <malay>yang</malay> okay <malay>aku ni dua puluh empat tahun</malay>
then (err) then
she ask the question <malay>tahu ke tak yang</malay> this place is very far very <malay>ulu ada</malay> transports <malay>sendiri ke tak</malay> then I said no but I've seen the map I can still walk there fifteen minutes [lah]
and then she said okay that's very good that's very good then after that (err) we'll just keep in touch (err) within the week we'll call you back
within the week so <malay>sekarang dah satu bulan</malay>
and there's still nothing so that's why I say this kind of thing [eh] like like at least <malay>bilang</malay> [lah] like don't keep the person waiting cause I was actually hopeful maybe
this is the <malay>rezeki</malay> I've been waiting for ya <malay>ke tak</malay> it's not it's not the one so that's why I'm like
(err) with every passing day (err) when the doesn't want to get back to you the more you feel kinda suck-ish [lah] like are you just playing my feelings want to play my feelings [ah] playing my heart
(err) it's not it's <malay>tak baik</malay> [lah] <malay>tak baik</malay>
I think I think I think that [one] is the worst [lah] okay so to talk about <malay>sakit hati</malay> this [one] I don't know if if <malay>kita jaga aib ke tak jaga aib</malay> because it it it involves <malay>masjid juga</malay>
so so recently I I think for for for confidentiality I will not name the <malay>masjid</malay>
but I will say the proximity of the <malay>masjid</malay> the <malay>masjid</malay> is in the east so this <malay>masjid</malay> he surrounding <malay>dia</malay> has quite a few other #masjids#
[ah]
yes so this is a part of singapore <malay>yang ada banyak masjid</malay> quite near each other [ah] if you knows what I'm talking about
so
ya but it's not the one that you probably think about is one of the <malay>masjid yang kat dalam-dalam sikit</malay> okay it's one it's definitely <malay>tak tak</malay> famous [lah] which is why <malay>lagi aku</malay> fed up
so okay so basically (err)
the whole story is <malay>yang mula-mula</malay> I got this call from this (err) person from I would say the communications department [lah]
[kan] so the communications department suddenly call me on monday afternoon saying (um) #assalamualaikum# #shazwan# (err) <malay>saya</malay> #nik# <malay>ni</malay> (err)
I understand from this person that you are helping us to design a poster so first of all in my mind <malay>siapa</malay> [sia] <malay>ni terus cakap</malay> since when am I helping to design a poster
then
for that time no because the way they say we have a deadline by wednesday is like (err) we are urgent [lah] urgent can you help us in my mind <malay>cakap</malay>
<malay>aku tak cakap benda</malay> I didn't I didn't want to be on board <malay>tapi</malay> the way you say <malay>macam kesian juga ini masjid</malay>
ya so so that's the story [lah] the middle person (err)
(err) eventually was someone that I met prior to this so we had a meeting before and he knows that I can do posters based on my blog
but the thing is that I don't like or don't agree on is that he just <malay>mentang-mentang kasi</malay> my
my number to this (err) communications officer [lah] then (err) after that
I did the poster so the poster was everything you know me [lah] my style is everything I do on Powerpoint then <malay>bila aku dah buat semua</malay> they they ask me
the first thing they asked is can you find the photos yourself of the of the #asatizahs# mentioned then <malay>aku fikir aku memang</malay> [lah] <malay>bukan orang alim</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> who are these <malay>ustaz</malay> I don't know these <malay>ustaz</malay> what if I type the same <malay>ustaz</malay> and I put <malay>ustaz nama nama ustaz</malay> different person I wouldn't know also [what]
so that's why luckily I have this friend secondary school friend [lah] <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>aku minta tolong dia sebab dia pun</malay> by right <malay>macam orang masjid</malay> [lah]
and he he managed to provide me <malay>yang gambar-gambar betul</malay> [lah] so #alhamdullilah# so what I do is I just take the photos then I do the caricature [lah] basically it's just copy paste edit the shape
and make a cartoon version of the <malay>asatizah</malay> and the guest speaker so the guest speaker
is #fandi ahmad# #fandi ahmad#
yes so so that's why I say this <malay>masjidnya sebab apa</malay>
<malay>ada pula panggil</malay> #fandi ahmad# so I already did the design (err) I understand that the communications officer <malay>sebenarnya dia orang muda</malay>
so <malay>dia</malay> actually understand my style <malay>dia pun suka</malay> my style but of course <malay>kita akhirnya</malay> when it comes to all these things higher ups the final say then (err)
I think the the funniest argument is that one of the people on top say (um) <malay>aku rasa ada</malay> problem because I think later they are scared that because when it comes to this
forum panel discussion you have your moderator your speaker your guest speaker
so by right even for me [lah] when it comes to the hierarchy of such an event <malay>kita selalu</malay> moderator <malay>dulu</malay> you need a moderator to moderate then you have the speakers or your guests
so for me my logic is because of space constraint <malay>juga</malay> I put it in diagonal manner I put the moderator up here then the #asatizahs# together
and then I got #fandi ahmad# but the person who viewed this thing said (err) do you think it might be offensive to the <malay>asatizah</malay> that the moderator who is of lesser rank is higher
then in my mind <malay>aku fikir asatizah boleh fikir macam tu ke</malay> is that is that healthy for you to say [eh] <malay>aku lebih alim</malay> [pe] is that actually healthy <malay>sangat</malay>
ya so that's why I was taken aback by that kind of comment [lah] so okay (err) I mean I try not to make a fuss too much I said okay never mind I will change it I will just put everything in one line
but then he say but from left to right is the moderator is still first and then <malay>asatizah</malay> and then #fandi ahmad# would you think that the moderator because he is first in line he is of higher rank
that's why I say [eh] if I <malay>macam tu</malay> I I put circle <malay>pun</malay> you will find somewhere to start <malay>semua mesti salah punya</malay> right
then (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
you know because for my for me (err) the the thing is me and this (err) officer
we understand we know it's just that the higher ups refuse to listen <malay>ni yang susah orang tua tak nak dengar orang muda</malay> so the explanation is okay but I still feel [ah] that's it that's it so once that happens
(err) game [lah] so I I really at that time <malay>memang macam</malay> upset [lah] but the [oh] the final blow right is that yesterday
they they give it to the chairman chairman <malay>cakap</malay> okay okay go published Facebook Instagram published it was published I saw it
on Facebook and Instagram at eight <malay>dia pun bilang aku</malay> that timing and then after that the next day <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> the officer called me
[eh] not call [lah] Whatsapp me say [eh] sorry #shazwan# we have to bring it down because the people might find it offensive
that the pictures of <malay>asatizah</malay> are made into cartoons and then ya !alah! I <malay>fikir</malay>
cartoon is literally the same image that I worked on
but it's just is is is an effect I never made the nose bigger <malay>ke telinga besar ke</malay> is not I think but then the person that commented said it is offensive
to have the <malay>asatizah</malay> drawn as a cartoon then <malay>aku fikir balik ni macam kenapa nak terperinci sangat</malay>
ya so that's why in this <malay>situasi</malay> you can actually see
that <malay>orang tua</malay> is not very flexible they understand everything then
(err) so the officer said
I really apologise for this thing (um) <malay>boleh tak</malay>
(err) <malay>kita</malay> delete all of your all of the drawings that you did and just put in the actual picture of the of the <malay>asatizah</malay> in my mind I was like
then the past three nights you asked me to make the last minute changes on the faces <malay>buat cantik-cantik</malay> bring it bigger make the font smaller
<malay>semua tu</malay> means nothing [lah] he say just delete everything just use the original photo can already
so here's the thing
is volunteering because the guy that handed my number to the officer
<malay>cakap</malay> we know of someone who can help us for free [ah] without consulting me or informing me at all
that is why <malay>bila aku dah</malay> [tau] <malay>dah</malay> find out who is the one responsible my Whatsapp was <malay>panas</malay> I literally texted
but only after I finished my poster I said (err) <malay>salam semua</malay> this is the poster that I have done
and suddenly a pause a long message later by the way if I may in future
please consult me before handing my numbers to people and then I just say [lah] (err) it's unprofessional this kind of thing all these then I said I did not know that I was supposed to be involved in this event at all which is the truth
<malay>nanti tiba-tiba</malay> [jer] <malay>nama dah masuk dalam</malay> for <malay>benda-benda yang kita tak tahu pun apa nak kita nak buat</malay>
[ah] <malay>memang</malay> so so right now the thing is on that end the poster is still down is still taken down but
<malay>yang mereka masih</malay> persistent to make sure it's photos but I've already made it clear to the officer I'm sorry but I will not make any more changes because I feel disappointed I said it just just just blurt it out
and then the officer say I understand where you're coming from so I will still try my best to to (err) <malay>macam tukar</malay> (err) <malay>pemikiran orang-orang atas</malay> [lah]
<malay>cakap</malay> to understand that this doesn't this shouldn't offend people like how you think it will offend people because it's just
it's just a caricature <malay>tapi kita pun nak kena tengok</malay> logic [tau] the logic is the poster I did it because I I was informed of the age group
the age group was aimed for twelve to eighteen year olds <malay>kalau</malay> let's say you (err)
secondary school [lah] <malay>kau tengok gambar macam</malay> comic and <malay>gambar macam</malay> real <malay>mana satu yang kau macam</malay> more !wah! this [one] seems more interesting
ya [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya
ya [lah] so I think the the thing about this is that the forum the the main theme of the forum is communication
so <malay>itu yang kelakar dia ni bahan lawak dia</malay> communication in the beginning <malay>pun tak kasi</malay> [tau] they never even inform me that I was supposed to do this thing
that's why I I I sound them all then <malay>betul-betul cakap</malay> I'm sorry I know I shouldn't have done this is it's unprofessional on my end I hope you may forgive me
then <malay>terpaksa</malay> [lah] <malay>kita</malay> forgive
<malay>tapi</malay> when they start saying [oh] by the way #shazwan# (err) can you just put the original picture [ah] that's it done I'm out thanks for nothing
because I mean to be fair <malay>juga</malay> [lah] if let's say you paid me and then I say this thing <malay>memang</malay> unprofessional of me because you already pay me but this part is that
you already say that I'm a volunteer know I mean I am forced <malay>ikhlas ke tak ikhlas</malay> so
that's the that's the sad part [lah] which is why it reminded me of the of the time <malay>yang dulu</malay>
<malay>kita ni kalau buat</malay> design <malay>ni</malay> freelance never do for free
that's why (mm) yes (mm)
the video [lah] [kan] the video
(uh)
(mm) (mm) (mm) ya
[ah] !aduh!
(mm) <malay>itu</malay> [lah]
so that's why like when it comes to people always asking the designers to make changes <malay>macam</malay> for them is so easy that's why like
even for me there's always that moment <malay>cakap kalau senang senang kau buat</malay> [lah] <malay>sendiri</malay> what you mean so easy do yourself
some more if it's free
if you want to pay if you're not paying someone and then you're asking someone to be so professional it doesn't make sense [lah] because the person will give you half ass work because you're not even giving half ass pay
giving pay
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] that's why that's why even for me that's why I don't do freelance job because of this simple fact when you say I like it but can you no
(err) no sorry by by way or the highway but give me your pay
then okay <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>kadang-kadang kita fikir balik manusia ni semua menyakitkan hati</malay>
heartbroken everybody is heartbroken feelings feelings tonight we got many feelings (err) time check forty five minutes congratulations we are now going to have fifteen more minute left then after that we will

(err) <malay>malam jumaat malam jumaat</malay> is thursday so the logic [eh] if you you if you're curious is that <malay>sebab kita</malay>
(err) we for muslims we start our days
at the at sunset
so <malay>maghrib</malay> is when we start our day so that's why for <malay>hari raya</malay> [ah] if you are also curious why we don't (err) fast
on the last day [eh] sorry why we don't pray on <malay>yang malam terakhir itu</malay> is because only <malay>hari raya</malay>
at night
but our day starts at night yes our night is actually the the the
the beginning [oh] damn
so yes (err) these are all the topics that we like to discuss you know we've been talking with each other but !hey! you are a
listener
ya now <malay>dah</malay> start <malay>merepek tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau kita asyik berbual</malay> for forty eight minutes straight [kan] these things will pop up I'm pretty sure we are not the only
(err) people the only participants <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>bual benda-benda merepek</malay> especially towards the the later part of this (err)
podcast (err) I wanted to say project which is the thing [lah] but for us we gonna treat it as podcast already [lah] <malay>kita betul-betul tak tahu nak bual apa</malay> [lah] [kan]

(mm) (mm) (mmhmm)
I want to say that's what they do but to be honest I only saw the ad on Facebook they say pay eighteen dollars per hour work from home I like
cause ya [lah] we we understand that through the trial we have to go through the trial first if we are successful then we can talk about the next step [lah] like we said as malay
when it comes to the next steps we need to know what's the next step if it's a little bit too much <malay>takpe</malay> thank you
it's been very simple but I think when it comes to the singlish accent will be quite
tricky on our end because for us being malays we will always have the #mat-mat# accent
but the #mat-mat# accent but I think
should be okay [lah] because you wanted singlish singlish is basically (err) <malay>orang bangsa macam-macam bual bahasa macam-macam</malay> together #rojak# and then that's that's our language our pride and honour
pride <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> record <malay>lagi</malay> [lah] <malay>dah tutup</malay>

if you if you not malay [lah] if if you really really do the extra step
your outstanding (mm)
around there yes

I usually go out at five <malay>asar</malay> five <malay>sampai balik rumah</malay> nine thirty
[eh] you underestimate my stamina <malay>ke</malay> brother I walk from from my house to east coast one hour

<malay>ada</malay> this group of students <malay>dia pergi</malay> this one area <malay>kat</malay>
I think indonesia and then while they were going up to the <malay>tempat</malay> [kan]
they met (um) some of the some of the people [lah] then they they told them (um) [ah] they went to the shop and then
(uh) they <malay>dia orang</malay>
I don't know if it's a <malay>bomoh</malay> but I think and then she <malay>macam</malay> advice <malay>dia orang</malay> [kan] <malay>dia dia</malay> she advise them about the <malay>macam pantang larang gitu</malay> and then
they violated every single one of them
[a'ah] <malay>yang tu yang tu</malay> [ha] ya
like that [one] is
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] [oh] they they call it
#nananggal# <malay>tak salah</malay>
no [leh]
no no they the it's #nananggal# not <malay>penanggal</malay>
[eh] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] cause [oh]
[oh] so
ya
ya
[oh] <malay>apa</malay> they malay peninsular so <malay>sama hantu</malay> [lah]
so it's not
it's because when I first saw it [kan] [oh] !chey! okay no because I thought at first it's a <malay>pontianak</malay> but then the <malay>cerita tunjukkan</malay> [kan] because the girl was pregnant then she hit the fact from the other friends
so [kan] that thing will
(uh) incredible tales ya that episode no no
ya
[ah] hanging ya
ya
[ah]
okay
[oh] [ah]
ya <malay>kat</malay> singapore
<malay>aku tak pernah nampak</malay> okay okay then

[ah]
which makes me wonder [tau] because [kan] <malay>dia orang patut</malay> [kan] they can go through
like solid objects <malay>tak boleh</malay> affect them [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> they get stuck
[oh] <malay>amal pengamal</malay> (oo)

<malay>seram</malay> [ah] wait then what's the purpose of the <malay>penanggal</malay> like

(um) that thing was going after the <malay>perempuan yang</malay> pregnant
ya but why I don't know [lah]
what's that
!chey! okay
<malay>apa dia</malay>
I know because like one reasons is because <malay>macam</malay> like they are more vulnerable and then they are <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
like they are more vulnerable because they <malay>ada benda yang orang lain nak tapi tak tak ada tak dapat</malay>
so they try to like steal it from them which is <malay>apa tu</malay> the baby [lah] it's like new life
[a'ah] ya ya <malay>ada ada</malay>
I think
ya ya ya (uh) something right ya [ah]
I mean <malay>kita dah berbual pasal ayat lain semua</malay>
ya <malay>itu</malay> that [one] just
because they they either <malay>makan</malay> the <malay>anak atau</malay> they <malay>curi</malay> the <malay>anak atau</malay> they <malay>ikat</malay> the <malay>rahim</malay> !eww!

packaging in marketing
ya
<malay>sambut</malay> what do you mean

[ha]
so <malay>kirakan macam kalau</malay> like you give birth
but then someone <malay>benda lain</malay> might be
what the hell
so is that is that why like hospitals are haunted
deaths
cause thinking <malay>macam sebab</malay> maternity work [kan] like babies <malay>baru keluar</malay>
so it's <malay>seram</malay> [seh] but then <malay>kalau macam</malay> you are if you are in the operating room [kan] and then <malay>kau baru</malay> give birth you know that the doctor is the one that's taking you right
[oh] that's why that [one] <malay>macam</malay> make sure <malay>kalau kau kat dalam</malay> [kan] you have someone like your family there so they can [ha] okay okay
[ah]
[oh] but then <malay>masih baru</malay> [kan] the
sorry [ah] but I have like submissions and an exam coming up
it's like you want to disturb me come back in like two hours let me finish this and submit
yes let me do this until two three five night then you come okay
ya
[oh] ya ya ya <malay>tidur mati</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>kau tak baca doa tidur</malay> [eh] <malay>asal</malay> [eh]
[oh] is it
(oo) so if it wakes you up then different story [ah] [ha] <malay>bodoh</malay> [lah]
ya
but <malay>apa yang dia</malay> call it <malay>apa</malay> (err) it's not <malay>khayalan</malay> it's like
your imagination [eh]
it's like it's your
imagination [eh] [a'ah] ya [ha]
because very vivid ya
ya <malay>betul</malay>
no ya that's what I found out actually actually this [one] the son of a peach also he he posts
the he looked up the stuff [kan] then he saw that actually <malay>jin dengan</malay> you cannot see <malay>jin</malay> and <malay>syaitan</malay> because they are in a different dimension ya so
ya [oh] no no cannot cannot
ya so what happens is that because <malay>kau kena apa tu hasut</malay> [kan]
so whatever that you see is actually just
<malay>macam</malay> is just playing in your head so the <malay>syaitan hasut</malay> you and then <malay>kirakan</malay> they like they are the ones that showing you these images in your head but actually you cannot see them because if you can see if you can see them means you can see the entire dimension [tau] everything that exist in that dimension
ya
true ya
they play with your mind ya ya
(mm)
ya <malay>macam</malay> that's why <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>nampak benda tapi orang lain tak nampak</malay> [kan] ya
ya
[seh] okay
ya
also <malay>orang lain yang kena</malay> [ah]
ya
disturb the people around them
ya
<malay>kurang asam</malay>
[oh] no wonder
tap
[oh] tap [ha]
(mmhmm)
<malay>kau pergi jahit malam-malam apa cerita</malay> okay
ya
(mm)
wait so that's one of the ways they <malay>kacau</malay> you [ah]
so <malay>kirakan dia orang</malay> actually <malay>pegang kau</malay> or they just make you think that <malay>ada orang pegang kau</malay>
okay okay okay I don't know
[eh] [a'ah] [eh] poltergeist
[ha] <malay>dia orang selalu buat</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like those supernatural <malay>punya</malay> like
paranormal [eh]
ya
ya I remember I watched the one <malay>yang kat</malay> malaysia [kan] where they the the whole entire team
<malay>kat luar rumah</malay> and then they will send someone into the one of the rooms and then the person will be lying on the ground
and then like <malay>baca-baca</malay> something basically like inviting the <malay>hantu gitu</malay> [ah]
ya but then it's like damn scary because <malay>apa tu</malay>
like the the thing will come to them right and then <malay>apa tu</malay>
the thing will come to the person
and then (err) like they will start like bordering the
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] the the <malay>pintu semua gerak</malay> and then they will see like lights and then they will hear sounds and everything
and then and then the person will like try to exit to go back to <malay>dia punya</malay> the team outside right
then like I don't know whether it's true or not because
like usually when they go out they we have like a a <malay>bomoh</malay> on standby <malay>gitu</malay> ya
ya like in case if anything happens [kan]
and then when they go until they will like it it's always like <malay>dia orang macam</malay> trembling or shivering or they say like <malay>dia orang ada rasa benda</malay>
and then like how do you know whether it's true or not
I mean ya but then
(oo) [ah] ya
(mm)
then
singapore
ya why [ah] is it like singapore like <malay>dia orang tak kacau sangat</malay>
!huh!
so you telling me that the <malay>hantu</malay> also like shifted back to the <malay>kampung</malay> then [oh] it became less popular [eh] less demand
ya
(mm)
[oh] I think it's because like is it like people in singapore <malay>tak</malay> practise as much as those
and also because like we don't have much of the resources <malay>juga</malay> [ah] ya really like maybe <malay>ada memang ada</malay> [lah] but like
modernised [eh]
we are religious
ya
[a'ah] [sia]
ya that's true
and like the <malay>pantang larang</malay> for <malay>bomoh</malay> right is more
ya it's so <malay>leceh satu</malay> and then it's like for the rest of your life or for as long as you are using it [kan] but for if you go for plastic surgery it's like
only two three months recovery then can already
ya
no [lah] for boobs it's like you need to change
every like ten years or five years ya
that [one] I don't know [ah] I think maybe it's just the expiry date or what
probably but ya [ha]
it's troublesome
like [kan] <malay>dia cakap tak boleh</malay> you cannot walk under the <malay>galah</malay> but then <malay>kat kampung dulu dia orang pakai galah</malay> #kot#
I I thought they use the clothes line the string <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
and <malay>kenapa galah</malay> like <malay>aku aku tak faham</malay> !huh! what's that
bamboo
[oh] is it they are scared of bamboo
properties [ah] then what if it's made out of metal <malay>atau</malay> plastic
!huh!
there's so many questions that
ya
[oh] [a'ah] [eh] ya
no <malay>bila macam</malay> those extendable <malay>galah</malay> [kan] that [one] made of metal [what] no [meh]
no outside of [oh] ya
no [lah] I mean if you you are drying it [kan] is it's already
like you will <malay>perah</malay> the thing first [what] before you <malay>gantung</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> [tau] <malay>jemur ke apa</malay> ya
so <malay>kirakan</malay> like when you absent-mindedly walked under the <malay>galah</malay> [lah] [ha]
ya
what's [eh] wait but for <malay>susuk kalau terkeluar</malay> you can just <malay>masukkan balik</malay> [kan]
[ha] then
it's <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] it's it's this actual <malay>peniti</malay> [kan] something like that
ya
I know like there used to be this show <malay>dekat</malay> #suria# where
where they show no not <malay>cerita hantu</malay> it's
(err) they ya ya so one of it is <malay>susuk</malay> they show like how the <malay>bomoh</malay> will <malay>masukkan</malay> the <malay>susuk</malay> then they will like [oh] it's <malay>sakit sikit</malay> [tau] so they <malay>masukkan</malay>
ya
and then like if <malay>kalau kau histeria</malay> [kan] you can see the needles in your face
but then <malay>macam</malay> but they say like <malay>kalau</malay> the person who the person who <malay>masukkan</malay>
is the only person who can <malay>keluarkan</malay>
is it so if like ya unless unless if you go under the <malay>galah</malay> and then <malay>dia jatuh sendiri</malay> [ah]
it's either you cannot die or cause <malay>susah nak mati</malay> like the <malay>nazak</malay> right
wait so the person will die [lah] it's just harder
ya
but <malay>tetap</malay> can die [lah] so okay [ah]
because if you cannot die [ah] <malay>habis</malay> suffer like that
so <malay>tak mati</malay> [ah] [oh] take it out
[oh] ya ya ya so it's like a
(oo)
ya
is it like
is it like your senses are still intact [eh] for a few it's like paralysis
ya
you know I I would just feel stuffy because
the <malay>kafan</malay> and everything
ya but it's like you <malay>tangan semua</malay>
<malay>bodoh</malay> <malay>sejuk</malay> [siol]
<malay>dah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak tak pakai stokin</malay>
ya ya ya
wait so they don't they don't bury you with <malay>kain batik kain batik</malay> is before [kan]
the funeral right [oh] !chey! ya so <malay>kiranya bila masuk kau keluarkan dari batik</malay> [ah]

(err) she said like <malay>ni orang-orang dulu kata</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> if you are at the funeral [kan] <malay>jangan diri depan kaki mayat</malay> because in case <malay>kalau bukan-bukan kalau</malay> like the person <malay>pernah ada simpan barang</malay> [kan] they might pass it to you ya so don't like stand I don't know how true this is [ah] but

[oh] okay so what like <malay>sekarang</malay> like what line you you at like (uh) what industry
[oh] (um) early childhood
ya but I <malay>pun macam</malay> not really (um) into it yet <malay>macam</malay> how how do I say it <malay>macam dulu</malay> I
<malay>baru</malay> [jer] <malay>baru</malay> [jer] because
ya I <malay>baru</malay> graduate (uh) last year as in actually this year [lah] the <malay>apa tu</malay> during the period actually suppose to have our (um) ceremony [kan] <malay>tapi tak boleh</malay> ya so I'm the unlucky batch
(uh) singapore poly (um) I (uh) [oh] [oh] sorry you don't know ya
ya (um) ya so (um) I I got into an internship <malay>dia ajar bukan ajar</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> it's speech and drama so I (um) my course actually applied drama and psychology (uh) so <malay>macam</malay> my interest is more to theater and stuff ya they <malay>macam</malay> post me to (uh) this early childhood not early childhood [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> like somewhat <malay>macam budak-budak dia macam</malay> actually interested (uh) <malay>tapi</malay> I got confuse I think I more interested in the (uh) in the drama side instead of teaching <malay>budak-budak</malay>
ya
when I was in internship [oh] (uh) so <malay>pagi kita</malay> okay (uh) so the internship place is actually at enrichment centre so <malay>pagi</malay> (uh) <malay>tak ada apa-apa</malay> it's just admin job then the admin job <malay>pun macam</malay> like <malay>tak susah sangat</malay> [lah] I mean like it was difficult because halfway <malay>kita punya</malay> supervisor then like a lot of teachers left in (uh) the company because of some things happen (uh) then (uh) so that's why the intern had a lot a lot more jobs to do in the morning but then like afternoon then <malay>baru macam kalau ada budak-budak datang</malay> for class [kan] then we are just I'm the teacher's assistant then the teacher assistant just (uh) <malay>tolong</malay> the teacher to just hype the class <malay>nanti kalau cikgu dia cakap</malay> something funny then we're just like (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> [oh] my god isn't it funny like that kind of thing [lah] <malay>macam</malay> stupid <malay>gitu tapi macam</malay>
ya it's like to encourage them to <malay>macam</malay> speak up <malay>macam</malay> do do the drama with them <malay>macam</malay> we will have like (um) dramas (uh) drama train which will bring them to the drama drama island then in that drama island the teacher will be in another role
okay okay
ya so like now I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if I <malay>nak sambung kerja dengan budak-budak</malay> or like I I'm just interested in the dramas side
(um) actually it's not like allow allow not like <malay>dia orang suka-suka nak</malay> allow but it's like (um) it's a bit unethical for me to work there also [lah] because like (err) I've been having <malay>macam</malay> low moods and stuff so <malay>macam kesian the budak-budak</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(hmm) I honestly <malay>tak tahu</malay> [seh] because like because right now that's a lot of thing that happening so <malay>macam</malay> I I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if it's because of my (um) my job only or is it because of my whatever that is happening in my life that contributes to how I feel right now that's why I'm (um) but I I came clean to my boss like I <malay>bilang dia</malay> (uh) whatever that's been happening in my life then she say [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) I don't think you're you're capable of working now so <malay>macam</malay> I need to <malay>macam</malay> set my head straight [lah] (uh) maybe I need to seek for help I go to seek for help first and stuff just make sure when you come back you feel <malay>macam</malay> hundred percent here [lah] because like right now you're a like everywhere
ya
to to work he he he said you can go back right
ya existed that this he welcomes welcomed back then that's good
(mm) but like (um) ya
(mm)
[oh]
ya
ya
and that's a big decision to make [seh] because like (um) it can affect your future if you stay here not happy then <malay>macam</malay> in the future like <malay>kalau lambat</malay> then you it's hard for you to change but now <malay>macam</malay> is the time (um) for us to <malay>macam</malay> explore but it's like exploring also is so difficult when you don't have anything to follow I feel
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>susah</malay>
ya unless <malay>kalau kita kerja</malay> part time <malay>yang macam</malay> (um) temperature taking <malay>gitu semua</malay> I mean it's it's okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay> good ya it's better than nothing <malay>tapi macam</malay> the thing is [ah] I'm just worried <malay>macam</malay> this is just <malay>macam</malay> just graduate [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> I think too much about stuff then (um) if I take that kind of job now then <malay>macam</malay> I don't have like much experience in like (uh) what I want to do in the future <malay>dia macam</malay> I scared <malay>macam</malay> I'm not prepared [lah] but this is just me overthinking [lah] but (um) if <malay>dapat dapat kerja</malay> the temperature taking <malay>pun macam bersyukur</malay> [seh] as of now
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya that's true
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
[oh] okay
<malay>berapa lama</malay> the the webinar
[oh] okay
[oh]
[oh] but like !huh!
ya
(hmm)
that sounds great then I think (err) my sister also took that job [ah] last month but like so like webinar you don't have to go to any venue [kan]
(hmm)
!wow! that's really good because like actually (um) when I joined the company the one that I'm taking a break now I actually suppose to go for a class to <malay>macam</malay> a diploma conversion ya so but then (um) for now obviously cannot (uh) go to the school [lah] the <malay>tapi nanti</malay> if like the situation gets better than we have to go to go back to the school so <malay>macam</malay> (um) I I don't know I feel like <malay>macam</malay> its a bit more demanding in a way <malay>macam</malay> and like I don't think we are allowed to do whatever we want I think we need to sit in like our house and like you know like just just sit <malay>macam</malay> focused on like just real school
[oh] no (uh) it's not (uh) teaching the kids at home but (err) <malay>apa itu</malay> it's just like normal school <malay>macam</malay> we learn about how to teach the kids at home but then in the morning <malay>baru kita</malay> teach the kids at school get it so from eight to eight two (um) one we teach the kids at school real kids then <malay>balik</malay> then (err) the teacher that lecturer will teach us <malay>pula</malay> on like about kid
(um) honestly I feel like a bit <malay>macam</malay> I don't know because I I didn't go for it yet [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I stopped before it started today was supposed to be the first time day first day work at the start of the class <malay>tapi</malay> (um) from what I think [ah] <malay>macam</malay> it depends on the company you work with <malay>kalau</malay> the company <malay>macam</malay> give you a lot of (uh) things to do like homework <malay>macam</malay> preparing worksheets for the kids <malay>tu semua</malay> they don't have like a proper system like <malay>tak ada macam mana</malay> [eh] they <malay>tak ada</malay> their own worksheet for us to just photocopy we have to make all the worksheet so <malay>macam</malay> it's that already a a lot of workload then <malay>kita pergi sekolah</malay> we have also we also have our assignment and like test <malay>tu semua</malay> ya so it's like it's a bit <malay>macam</malay> scary [kan]
[ah]
ya I feel I felt that way [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> that's why I felt really <malay>macam</malay> (um) I'm scared like I I had I had a meltdown <malay>semua</malay>
(um) I think they because there's only one that just (uh) finish the diploma conversion then she's she also said <malay>macam</malay> is going to be difficult [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> (um) the <malay>tempat kerja</malay> even weekend sometimes the boss I think <malay>macam</malay> she didn't like intentionally do this <malay>tapi macam</malay> just to <malay>macam</malay> she will like text us during the weekends <malay>macam</malay> to tell us need to do this this this so <malay>macam</malay> (um) my colleague <malay>yang</malay> just finish the diploma <malay>dia cakap</malay> [ah] it's a bit more demanding from the company itself then <malay>macam</malay> we we also have the our stuff to do so <malay>macam</malay> she she felt like it's a bit difficult [lah] to go through
that so <malay>macam</malay> she she was concerned about me [lah] because like she she knew that (uh) it's going to be tough for me and especially now [kan] (um) that's not enough teacher the card the company so so <malay>macam</malay> there's a lot of <malay>macam</malay> pressure on on the new teachers <malay>macam kita</malay> not teachers [lah] <malay>macam</malay> supposedly I'm not supposed to teach [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> they try their best not to <malay>macam</malay> expect do ask me to do a lot of stuff because I'm just program helper <malay>tapi macam</malay> sometimes <malay>nak tak nak macam takkan</malay> [lah] <malay>nak biarkan</malay> the company to drown [kan] like if you see this that you need to help obviously you need to do it ya <malay>macam</malay> that's why <malay>macam</malay> she say it will be early will be more tough on me [lah] because everything is new then <malay>nak kena belajar nak kena</malay> adapt to the changes then like (uh) <malay>nak kena apa belajar lagi</malay>
(hmm) ya ya
so now you doing (um) a part time and working it's continue working at your industry or like on break too
(hmm)
[oh]
(hmm)
true
ya true
(hmm) (hmm)
[oh] so how is it so far
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm) ya
#amin# sure #inshaallah#
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm) ya that's why (hmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] that's good
[ah] [ah]
[oh]
stress free
[oh] man ya that feels like me
!wah!
but then like okay so why why <malay>macam</malay> I'm stressing myself [kan] like I agree with you <malay>macam</malay> since since secondary school I already told myself <malay>macam kalau tak</malay> happy like there's no point of doing it like as long as I'm happy then I will continue then (um) but then now [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I know okay deep down I I didn't tell anyone [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> I know deep down that I'm not happy with working with children now then but then <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>takut</malay> because I didn't have any other choice as of now like I haven't explore other than theatre <malay>tapi kat</malay> singapore theatre is not really like appreciated and especially during this <malay>nak buat</malay> theatre <malay>macam mana</malay> [kan] like there's no audience but I know there's some like <malay>macam</malay> virtual and stuff but then <malay>macam</malay> virtual I feel like if you are already in already in one theatre company and then obviously (err) you it's easier for you to (um)
(uh) to stay there [lah] <malay>macam</malay> to continue from where you are <malay>tapi macam kalau</malay> you are not in the theatre company then <malay>macam susah nak dapat nak ada</malay> audition <malay>pun tak ada</malay>
ya
early childhood (um) the thing is like for early childhood [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak ada</malay> (um) much experience other than my internship internship ya so (err) I and I also my diploma is not early childhood diploma is applied drama and psychology so ya so I feel like (um) there's not much of got there's not many companies that would accept me then
ya the conversion is (err) is (err) the company itself <malay>yang</malay> I am in right now is actually <malay>macam</malay> they want they want new teachers to come in and it the boss also say that (um) she <malay>tak ini</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> expect us to stay very long she just (uh) provide a platform for a like a stepping stone <malay>gitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> she she encourages people to ya she <malay>macam</malay> looking for people who wants to become a new teacher there
ya so ya then the the the theatre thing <malay>macam</malay> I know deep down that I am interested in theatre [lah] to I want to <malay>macam</malay> act again and stuff <malay>tapi macam</malay> I know in singapore <malay>tak boleh</malay> [kan] so much that's the pressure [lah] ya I want to do theatre <malay>tapi macam</malay> I know it's going to be difficult on the finance like financially then
(uh) for like <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>nak buat</malay> early childhood then I don't feel that happy so but then <malay>macam</malay> and early childhood is not bad the the pay [kan] especially in singapore because they need people but then like (um) and like if I don't continue for early childhood I <malay>macam</malay> I just feel like my mum is not really supportive of me to quit [lah] honestly
ya it's it's not difficult it's like <malay>macam</malay> average [lah] <malay>tapi jap</malay> [eh] my mum my mum is like texting me
ya ya okay later I come back to that
I'm twenty
ya
[oh] okay
that's good
(mm) ya
that's that's sweet because like my mom <malay>dia macam</malay> passive aggressive <malay>tak tahu nak cakap macam mana</malay> it's like ya she <malay>macam</malay> I (um) because <malay>dari kecil</malay> we don't really <malay>macam</malay> (um) not very affectionate we are <malay>macam</malay> okay ya so <malay>macam kalau nak cakap dengan dia</malay> a bit awkward <malay>macam nak</malay> open up <malay>pun</malay> a bit awkward
then <malay>macam</malay> every time <malay>macam dari kecil</malay> I <malay>nangis</malay> about like [oh] my friend don't want to friend me all kind of things in primary school then she will be like you you go to school to to study not to to make friends so <malay>macam</malay> like she taught me to be tough [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like (err) emotions she put away emotions <malay>tu</malay> so <malay>macam sekarang</malay> I <malay>sedih</malay> I <malay>marah</malay> or like anything [lah] then I cannot like go to her to talk about things [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> I try my best <malay>walaupun dia macam</malay> push or try to avoid the emotion [kan] I will just like
try my best to explain to her [lah] <malay>macam</malay> what I'm feeling this way because this this this <malay>tapi</malay> then but I will text her I I cannot talk to her face to face because every time I <malay>cakap</malay> face to face she will <malay>macam</malay> like (um) suddenly become very cold then <malay>macam</malay> don't want to make eye contact then she will just say things <malay>macam</malay> (err) (err) if you cannot do it then I cannot force you <malay>macam</malay> that kind of stuff you know so <malay>macam</malay> I know that she's not happy but at the same time like she's trying her best to not <malay>macam</malay> put any pressure on me but <malay>macam</malay> that itself already made me (err) pressurize ya
(mm)
ya
so so it's like (um) so if I (uh) like I what I wanted to say just now was (um) because if I don't want to continue with this early childhood right my other choice is only the theatre come a theatre industry but then like I know theatre industry won't make much money [lah] as compared to early childhood
!huh! (err) (err) I I have seniors but then <malay>macam</malay> I don't really talk to them <malay>macam</malay> I really never never like try before because like I in the back of my mind I already told myself like I don't want to start if I start then like I scared like I'm stuck there <malay>macam</malay> I don't want to stop ya
ya so <malay>macam</malay> I go for the safest (uh) option first which is the early childhood [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> but the thing is like I know deep down I am not happy with it <malay>tapi macam kalau</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> go out of it I'm like I don't know where to go you know like I don't have any interest in anything else other than early childhood or theatre then <malay>macam</malay>
and also I'm thinking about because I have a boyfriend now then like his family a bit well off [lah] I would I would say so <malay>macam</malay> if like I don't have any this is just me [lah] (err) if I don't have any <malay>macam</malay> (um) any education or like any specific job in mind I scared <malay>macam</malay> like not good enough you know this is [kan]
(mm)
[ah]
(hmm) (hmm)
ya so (um) ya [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) as of now he keep on saying <malay>macam</malay> don't worry don't worry <malay>tapi macam</malay> you know like at certain extent you have to worry because like (um) that is your family obviously you say don't worry ya
like like (err) have you have you talk to your your boyfriend if you don't mind sharing
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
so he's okay [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(hmm)
[oh] that's good
(mm) (mm) ya so like <malay>sekarang</malay> I I don't know if I'm doing the right thing [lah] because (um) it was a hard decision for me to make to like (uh) stop whatever I was doing like I totally like left the company (um) not preparing any anything for them <malay>macam macam</malay> very abruptly [lah] the I didn't even like a complete the worksheet for them or anything but they my colleague <malay>yang</malay> [ah] the one that just went through the conversion she <malay>macam</malay> very quite helpful [lah] she <malay>macam</malay> keep on saying [oh] it's okay it's okay she will do it because also like my partner somewhat (err) ya we teaching the we we you <malay>macam</malay> assisting the same class
(mm)
(hmm) (hmm) but I didn't I didn't really have a good rapport with her before this because we were teaching assisting (um) the the same level [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> I was (err) more of the art and craft and maths but she's more of the language so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) craft obviously have a lot more to more to prepare <malay>tu semua</malay> [kan]
then like (um) the the thing is they they have this thing in the company <malay>macam kalau</malay> craft teacher <malay>dengan</malay> language teacher have to work together to prepare the craft materials
but then I think she didn't she didn't get that (err) idea so <malay>macam</malay> most of the time I was doing the craft then <malay>macam balik pun</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> craft weekends <malay>pun</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> craft so <malay>macam</malay> like it was really a lot of stress for me [lah] ya then (err) <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> I that point of time <malay>geram dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>dia</malay> keep on saying <malay>macam</malay> [oh] I'll do it I'll do it <malay>tapi</malay> end up <malay>tak buat</malay> so I <malay>macam</malay> pressured [lah] because I'm the one who carry out the craft lesson [kan] <malay>macam</malay> the one
ya so <malay>macam</malay> it was really really irritating then <malay>sampai</malay> like (um) the colleagues (uh) [ah] my other colleagues we very small company [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> they they saw me struggling <malay>gitu macam</malay> everyday I supposed to go home at one thirty like my contract ends at one thirty but then (err) I my contract <malay>pula</malay> my timing ends at one thirty [ah] but then like the the full time teachers ends at three three thirty <malay>gitu tapi</malay> my my timing [kan] I'm always there until four until three so <malay>macam</malay>
no no that's that's the thing so the company <malay>macam</malay> we already say in the contract so <malay>macam</malay> it ends at one thirty but whatever materials you have to do is your own time own target so <malay>macam</malay> ya that sucks [lah] that's <malay>macam</malay> that's why I feel like <malay>macam kalau</malay> I continue to work and go for school the conversion confirm <malay>rabak</malay>
ya it's a it's a proper diploma so (um) if you have a diploma already but then you want to to <malay>macam</malay> decided to go for early childhood industry [kan] so you can apply at an at and then (err) and will consider [ah] <malay>macam</malay> but most of the time they will they will accept you [ah] because <malay>macam tak banyak</malay> in singapore wants to do early childhood
ya <malay>tak</malay> I don't think is [lah] because like (um) it this is there's a stereotype of like (err) early childhood teachers gets a lot of because (um) there's they really need early childhood teachers preschool teachers because that <malay>tak banyak</malay> in singapore <malay>nak buat</malay>
ya I don't know what to say about that so (err) so the the the diploma conversion (um) after we apply but then (err) we we find a company first [lah] we find the company we can get sponsorship if we work with the company less than six months
then (um) if the company also want to sponsor you then like you apply for the and then you see then you say [lah] the company wants to sponsor you then (um) they will consider you if you fulfill the the requirements so <malay>macam</malay> diploma <malay>tu semua macam</malay> (uh) your O level english <malay>tu semua</malay> and then (err) they will contact you [lah] [eh] but there's only like two two openings every year if I'm not wrong there's one in in april ya april and (um) october
ya
(uh) I right now I don't know if I want to continue [lah] because like after talking to you then <malay>macam</malay> like really make me realize <malay>macam</malay> ya I should just <malay>macam</malay> do things that made me happy because like there's no point of doing getting money getting good money if I'm not happy like how long will that last
(hmm)
(hmm)
(um) that's that's good but then like (um) that's I used to have savings (um) before before joining the company [kan] and then like but the thing is I I thought I was going for the diploma conversion right so I my laptop <malay>rosak</malay> so I decided to buy a new laptop [lah] so because I was thinking okay with the pay that I'm getting then <malay>macam</malay> the laptop won't be so much [lah] and I also look for a cheap laptop not like <malay>macam</malay> one thousand plus <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
it's just like six hundred seven hundred then (um) after I got the laptop so <malay>macam</malay> my savings to <malay>terjejas</malay> like affected already then then like (err) when I join the company then I got the pay already right then <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] my first pay so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>belanja</malay> my my family to eat <malay>tu semua</malay> then like my boyfriend leaving so <malay>macam</malay> I help him with (um) (err) not help him <malay>macam</malay> like I give him as a gift to <malay>semua macam barang-barang</malay> for but not everything [lah] within just a few then <malay>macam</malay> I didn't expect this to happen like I didn't expect that myself will like (um) broke <malay>macam</malay> mentally broke broken
ya as in like mentally broken so like (um) I I didn't expect things to happen then <malay>macam</malay> my savings <malay>pun</malay> now like <malay>terjejas</malay> my laptop like I'm not really using my laptop that much then <malay>macam</malay> I really feel <malay>macam</malay> everything is just
it's just <malay>cubaan</malay> now [lah]
(uh) haven't yet because like I it's just everything just started I just really like (err) I just quit my job last week
ya but it's very pressurizing [lah] because like
(hmm)
ya but like I like mention [ah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if I want to continue with early childhood or not and also like I feel it's a bit unfair if I go for another early childhood company but I never tell my my (err) my boss that I don't want to work with her anymore
(uh) no I actually still have contract before until next year december ya
(err) she if I terminate the contract supposingly I have to pay like six thousand dollars
(um) so but a bit too <malay>macam</malay> you know so that people don't just terminate contracts <malay>suka hati</malay> ya so but I I brought it up to her [lah] about my situation <malay>tu semua</malay> but she quite understanding she say <malay>macam</malay> the six thousand dollar it's just for for formality [lah] it's not really <malay>macam</malay> to force to force you to pay or what
so <malay>macam</malay> she just <malay>macam</malay> let (err) let me (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> not pay it [eh] not pay her and just <malay>macam</malay> take a break first but like (err) she say if I feel better then I can I can continue working with her [lah] but then <malay>macam</malay> as of now I kinda have this feeling that I won't continue with her [lah] because really make
(err) I I don't think so I I ya that's good but at the same time <malay>macam</malay> I feel the guilt [lah] because I told her that I want to continue working but like (um) I for now I cannot continue first I regret for saying that [lah] honestly because like at that point of time I really you <malay>macam</malay> have a lot in mind so <malay>macam</malay> I tell her stuff that I <malay>macam</malay> regret now
(hmm)
I I don't know why I as of now I really <malay>macam</malay> feel like everything is (err) falling apart [lah] because (um) ya [lah] because of the job then until I don't know if I want to continue then about my health also I'm not really stable right now then (um) my my boyfriend I mention him right then he just left for his yesterday I mean he's just it's just <malay>tapi macam</malay> I had a past of like my (err) my father's death so <malay>macam</malay> it kind of like triggered me [lah] just <malay>macam</malay> ya that's what I'm thinking so like (um) he him leaving my changes trigger everything [lah] so (err) I'm feeling like really really <malay>macam</malay> at my lowest right now [lah] ya so <malay>macam</malay> I feel <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya so I don't know what to do right you know that's why <malay>macam</malay> I'm supposed to take a break during <malay>tapi macam</malay> my mind just doesn't want to take a break you know you to keep on working <malay>macam</malay> why am I gonna do what am I gonna do but then <malay>macam</malay> I need to <malay>macam</malay> ya so <malay>macam</malay> I don't know I'm really lost right now [lah] so I'm trying my best to <malay>macam</malay> look for freelance work from home kind of thing

ya I hope too ya I think it's my house wifi [lah] ya I think our recording should be okay
then ya [lah] I I I understand why what you mean by <malay>macam</malay> (um) you shy to ask questions like for me it's not like really I'm shy because I mean I'm in I'm from drama so I'm quite like okay with talking to people but like the thing is (um) I overthink a lot [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> when people <malay>macam</malay> just hesitant to say something then I will straightaway think [oh] I'm asking too much and like I'm troubling her or him <malay>macam</malay> I will start to to question myself [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like am I am I like <malay>menyusahkan</malay> or not that kind of things that's why like I don't really wanna talk not because like (um) I ya [lah] <malay>sombong</malay> or what but ya I I think it's it will be great talking to someone (err) especially like someone that I don't know so <malay>macam</malay> I don't really have <malay>macam</malay> anything to lose so if that sounds bad but then but then <malay>macam</malay> ya
[oh]
[oh] that's so nice
it's like meant to be
ya I I think it will help definitely <malay>sikit ke banyak</malay> still help thank you so much but I just want I just want to say that I I'm really like amazed at how <malay>macam</malay> you're doing it for your own good it's like you you <malay>boleh</malay> make that decision you know of like (um) taking a break and like exploring new things like I I don't know if I were ever have the courage to do that
ya
ya
ya [lah]
ya
[ah] [ah]
ya that's true
so it's like I I'm glad like even if or even that I just graduated I <malay>masih macam</malay> like in the past as they have this <malay>macam</malay> (um) want to like put (uh) put some into my savings so like now <malay>macam</malay> even though it's very little but I still them don't feel like I totally broke you know ya
so <malay>macam</malay> [oh] but [oh] my god can I just rant I mean like we just met but but I just <malay>macam nak lepaskan</malay> anger <malay>gitu</malay> because like I'm so annoyed because (err) so this month <malay>punya</malay> pay right I didn't know that my because like in the contract it says that I I can get a few few days seven days so <malay>macam</malay> every time this month it's just very unlucky for me [lah] I got food poisoning [lah] I got like <malay>macam selesema</malay> [lah] because there has been like cold (uh) cold bug around the school so (err) then I got it also then I also <malay>macam ada</malay> panic attack in one of the night because I <malay>ingat</malay> I injured my neck so <malay>macam</malay> this month I took a lot of thinking that <malay>macam</malay> you can like I can claim from their [lah] then <malay>rupanya</malay> they cut cut it off from my from my <malay>gaji</malay> then because like (err) I still <malay>macam baru kerja situ</malay> it's still not three months yet something like that [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> they ya but she
ya but she didn't tell me my boss didn't tell me that is like I I heard <malay>macam</malay> from my I'm not I don't know [lah] I I know I heard it somewhere that there's no probation or anything so <malay>macam</malay> and that's why I thought <malay>macam</malay> (um) we I already <malay>macam</malay> can claim the or what she also never say anything about it then after on like my second last day <malay>baru</malay> like I she mentioned [ah] about <malay>macam</malay> [oh] I took too much too many in one month like if I'm in another company definitely they will let me go and stuff so <malay>macam</malay> (uh)
the contract says I have (uh) I have seven days and like they never say any probation
ya but like at that point of time I already like giving her a lot of trouble you know so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>macam dah bagus dia tak suruh bayar enam enam apa enam ribu</malay> [kan]
ya that's true
no they didn't
(err) ya [lah] doesn't <malay>tapi sekarang macam</malay> I just feel a lot of guilt (err) towards the company so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if I want to bring it up or not [ah] because (err) then okay there's a there's a continuation to that then <malay>macam</malay> they cutting from my <malay>gaji</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> I already had in mind okay my <malay>gaji</malay> month will be like a bit less but it's okay you can still sustain me for like one month then I can find like part time job and then I (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> when I terminate the contract means I'm not continuing the the diploma they <malay>rupanya</malay> they will like <malay>macam</malay> will not get a refund if I <malay>apa tu</malay> (err) discontinue my diploma conversion in less than fourteen days
so the the company will have to pay will still have to pay around four hundred <malay>gitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> my <malay>gaji dah kurang</malay> then like my the the company has to pay four hundred which means I have to pay [kan] obviously the company won't ask won't <malay>macam</malay> want to pay for no reason so like I think my my pay will be like less than half you know this month then <malay>macam</malay> !aduh! <malay>sedih gila</malay> [seh]
ya
so it's like
like like I said [lah] that's why <malay>macam</malay> I I'm really free feel like this is my lowest point of life (um) because like money wise then <malay>macam</malay> like (um) my boyfriend left for <malay>rasa macam</malay> got triggered by my past then like my mom is like not really that supportive that much so it's like really [lah] what's the everything is just falling apart
I have <malay>kakak</malay> but then like she she move out already because she <malay>nikah</malay>
(hmm) two actually but (um) my I'm not close to my eldest one because (uh) she we <malay>lain mak</malay>
<malay>sama bapak lain mak</malay>
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm) ya
so
(um)
I think I for now I should just find jobs that's like (um) that won't bring that I won't bring it back home <malay>macam buat kerja kat situ</malay> then <malay>balik tak buat apa-apa</malay>
<malay>macam kalau penat penat kat kerja</malay> [jer]
I mean other than like there's (um) part time like <malay>macam</malay> F&B <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] guess can can do that <malay>tapi macam</malay> I don't know I kind of I'm not (um) I I have this need of like expressing my thoughts so like I don't think <malay>macam</malay> I can (uh) I can stay in can do that kind of part time but <malay>macam</malay> if there's no choice then I don't mind trying also now
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm) (hmm)
ya
ya maybe I could think of that too
(um) that's true [oh] my god I need to keep you on reminding myself that
(err) actually I just when yesterday (um) ya but then like (um) I I did not go poly though I I went to check organization do you know

ya but then like from there then (um) <malay>macam</malay> they will tell you [lah] or you you might need <malay>macam</malay> counselling or what then <malay>macam</malay> they will refer you to them [lah] me (err) I think if with them then can get a bit of subsidy [ah] I'm not so sure about that but then <malay>macam</malay> (um) because yesterday when they told me about the the (err) what I can do next then <malay>macam</malay> rate of like (err) what the next thing then we just counselling [lah] <malay>macam</malay> is forty dollars per session so like I think it's quite okay but

but apparently he said it's one sided [lah] cause the person keep on message but then <malay>dia tak layan sangat</malay> [lah] cause the girl very toxic last time ya that type I hope he's good to her [lah] not like the the #cheebye# #kia# ex
(uh) the ex is our age but she looks twenty five
ya legit legit (uh) next time I send you the her <malay>gambar</malay> very
[a'ah] <malay>betul betul</malay> ya

but she say she confident that he will choose her over the girl [lah] cause the girl very toxic like don't the girl always every time must only <malay>keluar</malay> with her only he <malay>tak boleh keluar</malay> with his other friends she <malay>tak suka</malay> the other friends also
so <malay>macam</malay> like everything must be with her only that type that type of girl ya

ya [eh] you know about the olivero also right
he he weird he cannot move on over the fact that rachel already got new and better guy
do you are you in
ya and his wedding is supposed to be this month [leh] august [eh] that's why I was like the fuck

ya
did you see his close friends the latest one
the one he post something like (um) nevermind even if I'm sad I will just let them be I think he was indirectly rachel and the new guy [sia] then I show I screenshot to rachel then she was an <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>dia ini</malay> ignore [jer] [lah] <malay>sudah</malay> weirdo [sia] #rilek# like he obsessed ya that's why
his soon to be wife
then what about your friend the toxic another one
a movie
<malay>tunang</malay>
(mmhmm)
for me [ah] cause to be honest you told me about her ex right like the ex cheat on her then always use her money all these then like why would you want to be with someone like that some more certis cisco you know it's not a stable job you earn a lot of money only cause you (um) and is very the timetable very #rabak# so if you date someone like that you can only go out with them at night like that
and most of their days is very busy [what] so I'm like just go for the guy [lah] he seems like a better choice but then if she really cannot wait for two years then I feel like she should just let go of the guy cause he deserves better imagine you with someone then you keep on thinking why I have to go through this again bastard [sia] the guy can could've find someone better [what]
then
what she want to do now
(um) I think she know what to do already [lah] just dump the new guy [lah] sis from what he sounds like <malay>macam buat pakai</malay> only like only use her when he need money all this then
it's a new relationship and you already keep arguing like that it's a red flag though just tell her to get back with her ex [lah]
cause he doesn't sound good
I think my boyfriend would beat him up [sia]
then
how did the new guy react
(mmhmm)
okay
then tell her find new guys block both of these two
but I think right your friend loves all this drama and attention that's why she's doing nothing to stop it
but okay [lah] no [lah] I mean for like girls normal [lah] they like cause if two guys fight over you who don't like <malay>siapa tak suka</malay> I also like
if a lot of guys fight over you [oh] why like so flower like that
[a'ah] [seh]
[a'ah] [seh]
but then she not stress [meh] from all these drama
[a'ah]

<malay>habis</malay> (um) ask us to use it (err) when we are at the airport <malay>sebab</malay> (err) who knows [kan] especially Indonesia <malay>agaknya</malay> maybe
not so safe [lah] and then (err) so I flew back I still wear the mask (uh) at first I thought <malay>macam</malay> too much [ah] actually <malay>macam</malay> maybe
it was a paranoia or something but when I came back to Singapore (um) and then I slowly see Singapore move to orange alert and then (um) the whole of Singapore they were taking it very seriously
and (uh) at first I was going to work and slowly (um) you see more and more people
<malay>kat</malay> station <malay>pakai</malay> mask <malay>habis</malay> (um) some of them (err) they there was no form of social distancing [ah] back then so there was no such advice but
mask <malay>ada</malay> quite a number of people they were wearing it [lah] and then (um) they decided to
eventually (err) make an announcement on and said that <malay>dia punya</malay> mask <malay>ini semua</malay> actually not mandatory [lah] at first then <malay>cakap</malay> only <malay>kalau macam</malay> you sick (err) you stay at home
(err) just <malay>jaga</malay> yourself [lah] there's no need to go out (um) and then slowly they start to quarantine and then slowly start to close the border and then
(um) slowly fall into the whole circuit breaker thing but in between there's a lot of doubt <malay>banyak orang orang macam</malay> didn't quite understand why we had to do certain things why the government asked to do certain things
maybe (err) eventually (um) it escalated to that level where it became a global pandemic [lah] <malay>habis</malay> Malaysia <malay>orang</malay> Malaysia affected <malay>orang</malay> Indonesia affected
at first Singapore was the first I remember we were actually the first ranked to <malay>macam</malay> got on the list [lah]
[ah] so at first we were the first <malay>habis</malay>
(um) we were eventually taken over by (um) okay [eh] at first it was China [lah] and then second it was Singapore
at first [ah] this is the global ranking towards it got worse in certain countries (uh) in Italy
(err) in Euro and then slowly got to America and now <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>kita</malay> in a state where (um)
is the highest [lah] so Singapore although we had our ups and downs but it looks like we are getting better
(err) but that's how I remembered my experience (um) when it first started (err) and how at that point of time I was
employed <malay>habis sekarang macam</malay> like looking for job because (uh)
let's put it like (um) I wasn't employed anymore (err) after this whole situation so now looking for job [lah]
how about your experience <malay>macam mana</malay> you were coping with it
okay to be fair I don't think <malay>siapa siapa</malay> anyone [lah] was expecting this kind of situation to just suddenly appear
and I think a lot of businesses were impacted <malay>banyak</malay> (um) even home based business at some point was (err) affected [kan]
(uh) that was quite bad like the whole malay community like more or less <malay>macam</malay> slammed her
some authority figure [ah]
ya but (err) because of what she said a lot of people <malay>macam tak</malay> satisfied [lah] <malay>diorang macam</malay>
you know
I'm just okay
ya she more or less got a big
(um) <malay>kena pulau rabak rabak</malay> [lah] basically because of her statement she even
ya and
I think
I think like most people what she should have done is even though sometimes you may think you may be right or <malay>niat dia</malay> the <malay>niat</malay> is there [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
sometimes it's not about being right sometimes it's about being kind you know yes sure your intention is good <malay>macam nak tolong</malay> all these regulation issue [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> sometimes it's about you you have to think about your consequences okay [lah] I mean of course the idea was not to be viral and not to get all this attention
<malay>tapi</malay> because of your words and especially now people are so uptight during this COVID situation is (um) what she should have done was
after she did it and of course <malay>nak</malay> return <malay>balik dia punya</malay> statement <malay>susah</malay> [kan] but at least <malay>macam</malay> just go out there and just apologize properly
and say that (uh) you sorry you didn't intend for this to happen (err)
at least apologize even though you're right even if you think you're right even if you are right just apologize let's say (err) I understand
<malay>tapi</malay> she chose to <malay>macam</malay> go online and just tell everyone all off that kind of thing is just crazy there's a lot of
ridiculous thing that happened during this whole COVID situation that (err) gone viral for no reason
(um)
and (err) some of them are funny <malay>macam</malay> the recent one where the Foodpanda rider just waving around
and I thought it was our good friend #Hadi# because okay to be fair <malay>sebab</malay>
#Hadi# dresses exactly the same as that guy
so ya no no okay exactly okay so when I see #Hadi# [kan]
last time when he was riding panda Foodpanda he just stop by my place once in a while for smoke or something
<malay>habis</malay> he will <malay>macam</malay> [ah] be in that exact same attire and the exact same pants <malay>cuma</malay> bike is slightly different [lah]
like the first time I saw it <malay>macam</malay> this could be #Hadi#
it could really have been #Hadi# the way they dress <malay>dia punya seluar dengan dia punya</malay> helmet <malay>dia punya</malay> visor
that's why I tagged him and a lot of people thought that I was insinuating that that was him
so that was quite funny [ah] but I saw the article [lah] I think Mothership covered this article about him
(uh) unmarried guy twenty four year old guy but (uh) I think a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> does really
(um) <malay>macam</malay> it's an unsung hero kind of thing so people were quite (uh) positive feedback [ah] about the guy <malay>dia</malay> super extra [ah]
okay my input is okay first of all
the thing about that whole situation is it's not about him per se but what he symbolizes [kan]
because if you think about it (um) just the fact that during this whole (uh) circuit breaker period and the contributions they did
and (um) while it's widely recognised by society singaporeans at large <malay>tapi macam</malay> it's not something officially recognized by the government
so it's a good analogy to say <malay>macam</malay> this guy this #mat# just <malay>naik</malay> motor <malay>habis</malay> just riding and
he is not part of the actual celebration of they are not actually celebrating him it's just that <malay>dia macam</malay> very extra so he just happen to be there and he just
(err) actually it is it is the symbol you know it it's not just the fact that it's Foodpanda but it's also the fact that
(err) the unsung heroes has to unofficially be there to be recognized
(mm) (mm)
(mm) well I have this opinion about (uh) all these food delivery [ah] so to my understanding [ah]
(err) the first <malay>tak salah</malay> Deliveroo was to start all this <malay>tapi</malay> in Singapore I don't know whether is Uber X or Grab or something [lah]
but what I really feel about food delivery is <malay>dia macam</malay> quite the game changer okay just think about this for a second [ah] about Grab drivers (err) not Grab drivers
but (err) food delivery [eh] so I feel that (um) it is a way to bridge the income gap from the lower income to the higher income and here is why okay first of all (um)
people who are do food delivery all this <malay>kalau</malay> they really <malay>macam</malay> really work hard macam #chiong# all the way [ah] <malay>macam</malay> maybe eight hours #chiong# all the way <malay>macam</malay> #Hadi# for example [kan]
(um) they can earn about three thousand four thousand or even five thousand a month depending on <malay>macam mana</malay> they hit <malay>dia punya</malay> incentive or <malay>macam mana</malay> they hit <malay>dia punya</malay>
(um) hours or <malay>dia punya</malay> right timing [ah] because all these riders [kan] <malay>macam dorang</malay> [dah] experience for a very long time they will know a certain technique or certain tactic
how to do it right <malay>kedai mana</malay> (um)
prepare food quickly <malay>kedai mana</malay> prepare food very slow they know how to play the game [lah] basically so if you think about it they can potentially earn a white collar salary
and they are blue (err) blue collar workers [kan] so think about this for a second [eh] to be a food delivery rider and all these you don't need qualification you don't need to go for an interview
you don't need to (um) like basically if you apply [kan] most likely you will accept
and you don't need a qualification it doesn't matter whether you N level you're O level you're A level you're university degree masters doesn't matter
you still get treated the same the way that you do things it all depends on your effort
and how skillful you are and how you deliver and how you strategize <malay>macam</malay> your delivery [ah]
so I thought it's really good if you think about it is a way for (uh) the lower income group to catch up
to the upper income group because <malay>macam</malay> especially during circuit breaker period a lot of people and the delivery price isn't very cheap also
so every delivery <malay>macam</malay> ya <malay>macam</malay> every delivery is about ala carte you pay about four dollars (uh) or something [ah] per delivery so
chances are and even there's rich people <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay> beli kopi just one and then they they get the person to deliver and they they they they they
the chances are a lot of this food delivery a lot of richer people higher income people
they will will be doing this deliveries and then they will passing on the money to the lower income who is most likely doing it [kan] so if you think about it
it's a way for the blue collar workers to get a white collar (err) job salary and it will help bridge the income
also if you think about this one thing I like about (err) food delivery also it requires no interview no experience
no much prerequisite [lah] maybe if you <malay>macam nak</malay> deliver <malay>naik motor</malay> [kan] then
[ah] <malay>kena pakai lesen</malay> you have to prove your <malay>lesen</malay> [lah] but if you are walking or you are riding a bicycle you don't need to
then think about this so I saw an interview (err) <malay>macam</malay> documentary [lah] don't know on Grab and how (err) some of the handicap people
(um) they managed to get jobs in Grab <malay>macam dulu</malay> (um) when they before Grab [kan] <malay>macam</malay> there's almost very little or no job they can do at all
so maybe some of them they did say <malay>macam</malay> if you are in a wheelchair maybe you can do admin job yes <malay>tapi ada orang macam</malay> down syndrome for example they can't really do much and
to be a person growing up with this kind of handicap you know <malay>macam</malay> is like a big <malay>macam beban</malay>
<malay>duduk kat rumah jadi beban</malay> [jer] <malay>puas hati macam</malay> you go out earn whatever little money you can and I saw this (uh) girl this Malay girl in a wheelchair [lah]
and she earns only about thirty six dollars a day [lah] for example on her electric (err) wheelchair and stuff like that delivering food and because
of how slow the electric chair also you you can't expect to deliver [lah] maybe <malay>satu hari</malay> deliver four or five items [lah] for example
but the fact that she can make that small amount of money no matter how small it is [ah] okay and maybe people might tip her or something I don't know
but the fact is (um) you can it it it can it lets you stand on your own two feet [lah]
so <malay>macam berdikari</malay> [lah] so instead of
relying on people or even when you can't get a job at all maybe you have some sort of special needs or special syndrome food delivery
the interface <malay>macam</malay> the training everything it allows you to do such a simple
(err) it it simplifies the task basically <malay>pergi sendiri</malay> pick up <malay>pergi sana</malay> drop off so it it it gives this
people hope because there's no need for interview imagine if she is looking to (err)
admin position or something <malay>macam kena</malay> interview <malay>tak tahu</malay> pass <malay>ke tak</malay> (err) your experience whatsoever like a normal job
you know you need to interview but food delivery it doesn't matter whether you have a masters degree you have O level or you are in a wheelchair
you will get it you will get it most likely you will get it unless <malay>macam kalau</malay> too saturated or something [lah] there's too much driver around so I thought that was quite interesting as well
(um) the way that the food delivery has changed the landscape of earnings and how (uh) blue collar workers can potentially earn white collar workers <malay>punya</malay> salary
so
ya you need to write sheet down together your thoughts but anyway (um) with regards to that (uh) there are some people who are like that as well
and I guess the good thing about this panda thing is it's quite an indiscrimination kind of
(err) (err) employment
(err) I don't know if this is an actual word indiscriminatory indiscriminate <malay>macam</malay>
you you don't get (err) you don't get denied (err) okay <malay>selalunya</malay> the idea is when you do the employment [kan] (err) you cannot be judged based on your I don't know (err) race or
your gender stuff like that but in this case also it it it it doesn't discriminate your education level as well
which is something that has a high emphasis [lah] in singapore so whether you are (uh) as mentioned before whether you are
(err) low educated or highly educated you still earn the same it depends on how much work was actually done and when you think about it is it something like
because of so much flexibility in your timing you get to decide [kan]
so <malay>macam</malay> for example delivery if you want to work you turn it on and then you work when you're done you're done
so the last time there is so much flexibility in this kind of work is a taxi driver so taxi driver I assure you should know my dad is a taxi driver [kan]
so (err) <malay>nak kerja kerja tak nak kerja sudah</malay> so when you're tired you get home
so basically the only commitment you need is you go out and then you grab (err) you pick up passenger and then that commitment is between
your (err) (err) picking up the passenger to dropping them off but
here's the thing right so with taxi the commitment is you have to pay for rental hundred dollars a day so
so for this drivers they have to actually make sure they earn at least hundred dollars after they earn the hundred dollars whatever they earn is theirs
so that so called keep them motivated [lah] whereas <malay>macam</malay> delivery for motorbike delivery for example bicycle delivery you're not tied down
meaning to say actually let's say you
chose a bicycle and you really (err) let's say you already have a bicycle [lah] let's say you choose a bicycle and you want to do this delivery
whatever you deliver whatever food panda give you that is exactly what you get in your pocket is much easier to calculate
and you don't have that burden of [oh] <malay>hari ini kena buat sepuluh</malay> delivery for example no you earn how much you get that's yours
so it it simplifies a little bit
[ah] yes okay definitely [lah] so basically <malay>macam</malay> you go to the shop and then the food costs ten dollars (err) what you get
is (um) basically is through the app <malay>punya</malay> interface [ah] so as if the app interface says you earn seven dollars that seven dollars is yours [lah]
it's it's already a net amount <malay>dorang</malay> already cut off whatever that needs to be cut off (err) because sometimes
for example (um) whatever the food is <malay>dorang</malay> [dah] minus the food amount so (err) this delivery apps they alreally take a bit of your card
<malay>terus</malay> (err) whatever is shown in your phone <malay>macam</malay> you earn let's say six dollar forty five cents for example [ah] that's yours [lah] basically
so you can calculate very easily rather than having to go through the process and it cuts down the stress basically if you decided
you are okay let's say you are riding <malay>habis habis aleh-aleh dia hujan</malay>
and then you already made two deliveries you want to go home you can go home you don't have that stress of
[oh] <malay>tak</malay> !ee! I still got to go on I need to hit (um) ten deliveries today or (uh) I cannot pay my rental or whatsoever so
it has that sort of it extended flexibility [ah] and I don't think a lot of Singaporeans see it this way [lah] it's just something I just thought about recently
and how it is a good way for people <malay>macam</malay> let's say they have spare time [ah] <malay>macam</malay> let's say they work nine to five
<malay>habis malam macam</malay> they got nothing to do they just wanna okay tell you what let me just turn on my device and then (err) just make a few deliveries on the way home maybe
maybe (err) do a three hour trip (err) three hour or four hour or five six trips
then go home [lah] so you have that extra income cash it go straight to your bank account
(uh) as opposed to waiting at the end of the month that kind of thing you know it's instant so it it it is something that (um) a lot of
the there's a lot of factors why it is such (uh) active (um) kind of employment especially for the lower income (uh) people to help a bridge to the higher income people
(err) ya so we were supposed to talk about corona virus <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> [dah] starting so much on delivery
well it's not like we have a focus so it's okay
okay I think we will stop for about half an hour so
what
okay
(err) it does
(um) so during the circuit breaker period of [pe] was it two months
I think it was two months
so how how were you coping what were you doing (um) did you
actually even go out at all did you do a lot of food delivery (err) did you meet anyone or
okay question online exam what is stopping people from I mean to <malay>buku letak kat tepi
[oh] okay nevermind
but won't they make you have the camera turn on
okay another question what is stopping you from hiring someone to do the exam for you
what sort of (err) security feature or identification <malay>yang dorang</malay> implement
[kan] <malay>risau</malay>
no [lah] if you have forty eight hours and you know what exam it is you can prep what you don't have to get it within the forty eight hours
you can prep earlier on and say [eh] I'm doing this (err) exam (err) next week
(err) I pay you two hundred dollars [lah] just come to my house you sit in front and then you do for me okay [pe]
man I don't think I can I don't think I can go back to school already <malay>macam</malay> <malay>kirim salam</malay> [ah]
seriously
I mean who you would you get to the level where you think you are at the not say pinnacle [lah] but you think that you are <malay>macam</malay> everything [dah] okay
and you you think that you you can survive on that level of education project <malay>kerja</malay> just to survive on the salary from that job
(um) but I kudos to you [lah] <malay>memang</malay> is not easy to go back to school when I if you ask me to do it now I would probably won't don't it
right well characters is something inevitable
or Facebook <malay>ada</malay> politics [pe] <malay>sekolah pun ada</malay> politics [pe] but one thing I okay so just to do a very very
brief shallow comparison between school and work I would say that
in school <malay>walaupun</malay> you don't have to go everyday and you can plan your timetable whatever <malay>belajar</malay> but apparently you always have this
sinking feeling at the back of your head that <malay>macam</malay> there's exam coming up and you know you should be studying <malay>macam nak</malay> enjoy <malay>susah</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> okay it it depends on people right so (um)
I think also it depends on school as well [ah] because when I was in uni (uh) (um) a lot of people who went to like me [kan] they (err)
two major popular universities that they went to is either or [eh] so <malay>macam sekolah</malay> so basically you study throughout the whole year
towards at the end of the year one big major exam
whereas for the one that I went to basically (err) <malay>buat</malay> project
(err) it it it becomes like what (uh) eighty percent of your grade then twenty percent <malay>kat belakang</malay> exam
so in a way you can balance [oh] out you can you know work together and you know maybe you are not the most academically inclined
so that contributes to maybe twenty percent <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you have <malay>macam ada</malay> solid group you can work with
and it can help make you up it it's a little bit a balance of both but (err)
I don't know maybe your school is not like that maybe your school is exam based or but I am sure yours <malay>ada</malay> project [kan]
sometimes (err) if you want things you've got to do it yourself you want to get things done
there is more to life than giving your girlfriend or girlfriend twenty three gifts my goodness save save the money
anyway you are broke so anyway I think the difference between your classmate and you is that you have been at least out in the working world
(err) for a couple of years you actually (um) understand and appreciate what (err) higher academia can bring compared
to your peers (err) in school at the moment [kan] even for myself [kan] if you ask me to go to school now and I were to go to school and (um) if I really want it
I think I would be able to have that kind of motivation because you know what it where where it can bring you
and you know that the results or (uh) it it it you will you more or less know what will happen if you don't do well you more or less know what happen when you do well
and you know where it unlocks you to you know as compared to <malay>macam</malay> all these <malay>budak budak</malay> they still have not have a taste of full life <malay>macam</malay> full working employment yet
so for them they don't know they don't know exactly what they are the consequences of not
getting a respectable grade it it hasn't hit them yet so I can understand I mean we were all once students who I mean even yourself when you were in poly
(um) you know it's the uncertainty of (err) okay [lah]
you know if I don't do well then don't do well [lah] you know but (uh) once you are in a position where you are out
that's why I think a lot of my friends <malay>yang</malay> (um) went to you uni SIM basically (err) university
night university [lah] so <malay>dia orang</malay> juggle between the job and basically if you do that you are throwing away your life [ah] there's no more social life basically
(err) <malay>pagi pagi</malay> daytime you go to work and then (err) malam then you go to school
and then you rinse and repeat basically you need to find time <malay>nak buat</malay> (err) <malay>nak buat</malay> group assignment <malay>nak</malay> study <malay>untuk</malay> exam at the same time in the daytime you are working
is very exhausting and (um) some of my friends did try that route
and they were successful (err) well kudos them
ya there's a lot of compromise (err) and you have to be willing to <malay>macam</malay> at least throw away one aspect of your life and typically is social [lah] because there's so much there's only so much sleep you can throw away
but social life go all the way no problem
she knows she knows
you probably deserve it you probably deserve it anyway please continue
no [lah] at first to be honest [ah] at first <malay>bila</malay> all this thing happen [kan] <malay>macam</malay> (um) it's interesting (err) because is something novel
<malay>macam</malay> is not common <malay>apa dulu</malay> to to (um) communicate through okay maybe for you [lah] but for me it's I it's not common for me to do video calls
even with my own family <malay>tapi</malay> when this first thing happen and you will start communicating with your friends online
(err) at the comforts of your own home on your own bed anytime (uh) <malay>kerja</malay> (err) in your own room
it it seems fun at the beginning but afterward <malay>macam</malay> I think it depends on people also [lah] because <malay>ada orang ada orang boleh</malay> focus when they're at home
there's some people like myself better focused when not at home and distracted by I don't know
snacks [lah] toilet [lah]
or the bed sleep [lah] take a nap during lunch time <malay>tu semua</malay> for some people it it it it's harder
you know because everything is there already and we just whereas <malay>kalau macam kat tempat kerja</malay> you've got to drag your ass and then
you actually groom yourself you know you comb your hair and then
you go out you take a shower and then you feel refreshed take coffee and then you're ready to get on the go so some people (um)
they switch into mode you know <malay>macam</malay> home mode (err) <malay>duduk kat rumah macam</malay>
more relaxed and then they are in that environment of relaxing cause for me when I'm at home I'm always feel like I'm in relaxing <malay>punya</malay> mode
and when I'm out I feel like I'm in out mode you know when your hair is <malay>macam</malay> all wax style and then
[ah] you know you're wearing clothes (um) and then you go out and [eh] you you just have that vibe <malay>macam</malay> I'm I'm ready to take on the work
you know <malay>macam</malay> when you're home you just want to relax lie on the bed watch video Netflix or whatever so when you you mix that kind of black and white and you get that greyish kind of area
the productivity for some people such as myself is not so good to be honest
(err) I don't know for me it would be doubly hard
(um) if doubly is even a word for studying
so !aiya! I mean so
no don't get me wrong I enjoy I enjoy the break I enjoy the break in (um) I enjoy the break in the regimen I enjoy the break in <malay>dia punya</malay> scheduling and stuff like that <malay>tapi</malay>
I don't know [eh] ultimately it is a state of mind [lah] so if you are in that state of mind and you of course you have to have discipline also
<malay>macam dekat rumah</malay> you can just eat <malay>macam</malay> you can snack and all that shit (err) but <malay>kalau kat luar</malay> (uh) <malay>macam</malay> you need to walk for it and (uh) I don't know
when you order you still when you order food you still need to
pay someone has to pay say you pay or your family pay
do you okay do you know that when you okay let's say when you (err) do delivery (uh) I think the so called delivery fee is about <malay>macam</malay> four dollars something like this [kan]
but if you are on Foodpanda there's a system called panda pro where you pay like
eight dollars ninety cent a month or something like that and you get like twenty deliveries
it's really a good deal okay you you check it out you go to Google you just type (err) Foodpanda pro
and you can actually see they have <malay>macam</malay> those package and the funny thing is if that month you just order two times you already make up for it because the the most basic package <malay>tak salah</malay> is (err)
ten dollars and you get five deliveries that's already two dollars per delivery
so I I don't know why not more people are not into it a lot of people do ala carte
no it's like a pass [lah] it's not really a promo if you say promo means it's <malay>apa macam</malay> limited edition [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> it's actually has been around for awhile
circuit breaker I wasn't sure but (err) if you go now it's definitely available
[oh] well people still deliver food a lot of people still <malay>macam</malay> still work from home [pe] <malay>banyak orang</malay> work from home [pe] <malay>sekarang</malay> [lah]
its not like ya most offices are still closed
most people stay at home during this whole period until until the end of the year
well ya well #Nurul# didn't even have a break in the first place she is an essential worker [lah] so it's a different story but for those people who
can work remotely they've been working remotely all this while <malay>sampai sekarang</malay>
suspect until the end of the year [ah]
fishy [ah] the Russian <malay>punya</malay> vaccine they didn't complete the trial the trial number three [what]
<malay>entah</malay> [eh]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah]
personally I think if at the by the end of the year I manage to go one vacation I'm actually more or less quite happy already
I went this year I went #Jakarta# once only
that was the only overseas trip I did this year
what the the the thing happened in February ya the thing happened in February [what]
it was very fast
ya well I think also because in (err) late January it was Chinese new year I had to go #Jakarta# but I think we were supposed
to go I mean I was scheduled to go for another vacation I think in May or

thirty more seconds <malay>kita kena</malay> clap [eh] <malay>lepas ini</malay> or
<malay>habis</malay> just stop [jer]
okay at this point but did they say though it must be exactly one hour or about one hour
okay <malay>tak apa tak apa tak apa</malay> (uh) it just crossed one hour for me so I am gonna turn it off right now

okay [ah] first <malay>kita berbual pasal</malay> regarding our hobby [lah] okay [ah] so you can first what is it your hobby
(um)
<malay>cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay example like <malay>kalau</malay> for me my hobbies is [ah] I like to read books I like to travel I like to
[ah] mostly spend time <malay>dengan kawan-kawan ke apa</malay> [ah] that is my sort of hobbies that I like
[ah] I like to I am more an indoor person I don't really <malay>suka main dekat luar ke pergi pantai</malay> I don't really like it
[ah] so you say you like shopping right so what type of things you like to shop
(uh huh)
so other than
<malay>punya</malay> brand <malay>tak ada</malay> you don't have any other brand <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>suka ke apa ke</malay>
[kan] and I think you also <malay>suka</malay> Coach
you <malay>pun suka</malay>
[ah] quite lately [lah] I think that <malay>daripada dulu pun</malay> you <malay>memang suka</malay> Coach if not just lately
[ah] so <malay>apa lagi yang</malay> you
you <malay>apa</malay> you <malay>minat selain daripada</malay> bags
okay because for me [ah] whatever you cook I'm willing to eat and then the thing is I want you to explore [kan] <malay>pasal daripada dulu kalau nak kata masak</malay>
we <malay>apa</malay> more like
<malay>terkongkong ada orang cakap mesti macam gini mesti macam gitu</malay> [kan] so
when you
[ah] yes so is so now when you see for yourself [eh] actually if I do this way it it also can be done so it's your own way of doing things
important the family <malay>makan</malay> and enjoy and so far you are doing
okay you are not like <malay>macam apa tak tahu masak ke apa</malay> it's edible [lah] <malay>boleh makan</malay> and there times <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>masak pada</malay> I is
(uh) fantastic [lah] it's good <malay>juga</malay> [lah] [kan]
[ah] I enjoy eating it which is something good [lah] [kan] hopefully
you can cook [ah] more things [lah]
<malay>takpe</malay> [lah] the more the more rounder become most to most
[ah] exercise more [ah] exercise more in the imagination [lah] in reality I won't exercise
[ah] yes I like to play football last time and that was last time maybe
[eh] this year what thirty nine
maybe ten years ago I think ya [lah] ten years ago still can play [lah] but now I think it'd be better
to watch football then to play anyway in singapore <malay>nak main bola dah susah</malay> I I try to ask my friends to play all
got injuries there injuries here so don't really got chance to to play [ah] maybe
[ah] if I play football with
with #sharif# if the kid maybe can can be done <malay>ataupun</malay>
[ah] I become a soccer coach
if I did
if I do become [lah]
doubt so [lah] I think I prefer to read up about it
and watch about it [lah] don't want to waste my energy [ah]
during the malaysia cup [ah]
I think in terms <malay>kalau</malay>
the atmosphere to get back to the malaysia cup days is is
is over [lah] first of all is the
priorities
and the lifestyle it has changed
in fact can say the whole
[ah] the whole society <malay>punya</malay> makeup <malay>pun dah</malay> changed I think now we are
mix too much mix
that we don't know who is who
[ah] whom is like
and the passion is just not there [lah] I mean even if
I think even if let's say if singapore is to continue with the malaysia cup until now
I think the interest will also die off
because
think is not of just about the facilities [ah]
<malay>kalau kalau</malay> passion the thing is passion is there
the atmosphere will come
the thing is the passion is not there because of why because of lifestyle last time
<malay>budak-budak tak ada benda lain</malay>
<malay>budak-budak cuma</malay> only have
[ah] football
and basically the basic things to play so basically is
when you play football it's really to
to [ah] play for your country so the feeling the impact of the passion is <malay>lain</malay>
<malay>kalau sekarang ni</malay> when people play is
for the money for the fame [kan] then there are
then why you I want to play football in the
[ah] in the basketball court or in the
football court when I can just relax and play at FIFA right
[ah] I can just [ah] imagine myself to be #ronaldo# or #messi#
on the screen
[kan] if I feel like I want to stop a while I just pause
when last time when you play
you imagine yourself so you're moving your body and you know like you can just move at my fingers and all that so that is the difference even if <malay>macam</malay>
now like <malay>dulu kalau kita nak tengok</malay> internet <malay>pakai</malay> computer will really stay in front of the computer
and to or wait for it to fire up then you can go in now basically
you are on the move the internet is all in your fingers [kan]
how come last time when people make appointment only handphone just via phone call or what
or say okay I meet I meet you here at this timing no phone call no nothing
yet we can be on time
<malay>tapi</malay> now even with handphone
you can basically
contact with the with the people
[kan] contact the people <malay>pun</malay>
yet you are late
you can message people yet you cannot find the place you know all this kind of things [ah] (um)
(uh huh)
yes
ya so that is the different [lah] people change
[kan] so maybe certain things will be left behind [lah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
<malay>tak ini</malay> [lah] so the
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] the changes in in time [eh] so in order to survive
we have to be adaptable
try to change
to keep up with the time [lah] [kan] cause if not you are going to have issues if let's say you are going to still be
[ah] mentality <malay>zaman dulu punya</malay> [kan] <malay>tak nak</malay> handphone <malay>tak nak pakai</malay>
[ah] internet [kan] I think <malay>kalau sekarang ni</malay> if now we want to survive without the internet it's almost
[ah] impossible [ah] [kan] [ah]
okay (um)
yes
[ah] I mean even for us as as parents we cannot be <malay>apa terlalu ke belakang</malay> if let's say we are too far
[ah] behind [kan] then our kid will be affected so we have to
we understand that we have to be up to date no need to be so advanced but
[ah] just nice for his [ah]
or his or her development
in the future [lah] even now in school like you have to do
learning at home studying at home using the internet
[ah] [ah]
yes correct
[ah]
(um)
[ah]
ya [lah]
have to have to try [lah] [kan] <malay>tu kadang-kadang</malay> when we try <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>susah juga nak nak</malay> catch up [kan] but we we still have to
to learn to set up and all that [lah] [kan] okay <malay>sekarang nak</malay>
<malay>berbual pasal apa</malay> topic <malay>lain</malay>
the thing that we enjoy
to do together I think we can talk about our travel
[ah]
[ah] but in terms of travelling
<malay>kita takde</malay> [lah] travel <malay>banyak-banyak tempat</malay> [kan] [ah] so for our travel is mostly to
[ah] malaysia [kan]
[ah] [ah] maybe thailand and
indonesia and australia [ah]
hoping to cover all ASEAN countries
but unfortunately because of the COVID
[ah] (um)
[ah] if not we will be like <malay>apa</malay> every year at least [lah]
[ah] favourite place [ah] favourite place
not much changes compared to living in singapore as but of course the price is
much lower okay [lah] our singapore dollar is strong [lah] then
I think <malay>bila kita pergi tu apa boleh</malay>
so hope <malay>macam apa</malay> we can
do our one year shopping of
of clothes maybe [kan]
so <malay>biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>pergi satu beg balik tiga beg tu biasa</malay> [lah]
but it's a really complete
(uh) shopping [lah]
for the clothes only [lah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
what are the [ah] pattern what is the <malay>perangai yang kita boleh</malay>
[ah] click <malay>atau tak</malay> click what is our
nitty-gritty details
then maybe you are okay I not okay [kan] but of course there is there different [lah] when you go travelling as a honeymoon is is is different because it's still something new [kan] but I think if now we are to go to the same place
the feeling will be different cause the understanding is more
is [ah] is stronger and then I think you will enjoy it more
(err) <malay>kalau bawa</malay>
our kid also will enjoy it more also [lah] [kan]
(uh) but
yes [ah]
[ah] ya [lah] you will set the goal when you go [ah]
[ah] [ah]
[ah] I think it's not only the
prompt reaction part [lah] [kan]
I mean
ya [lah] I think certain things you are more
[ah]
comfortable in handling and
[ah] certain things I am more comfortable in handling [lah] I mean in terms of money I think you are more comfortable and you do the money part
ya for me is I am more comfortable in
[ah] planning
I enjoy the I enjoy planning and seeing that things goes smoothly [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] [ah]
ya [lah] [ah] when authoritative-ness then
[ah] <malay>apa</malay>
people don't argue with you
[ah] yes [lah] you can <malay>ke depan</malay> [lah]
but if the other party decide to fight back with you
[ah] then you will go back go back go back and then you won't be in front
[ah]
ya because generally I am not that
picky
I'm not that particular as long as it's okay [lah]
[ah]
<malay>takda</malay> [lah] at least [kan]
we are realistic [lah] [kan] what we what we pay for is what we suppose to get
but sometimes for me it's like
just get things done and over [lah] I don't want to like waste time on
something maybe to me is small [lah] but to you is
I pay for it then I want to get it [kan] so that is the difference
[ah] [ah]
[ah] ya
I think for the #jakarta# [one]
when we reach
there we were like [eh]
first thing is the airport [lah]
very different we feel like am I back in the eighties and looking at the flooring reminds me of
(err) shopping centres (err) in the eighties [kan]
so okay [lah] that is one thing then
the other thing is when we walk
(uh)
[ah]
ya when we first <malay>sampai</malay> the hotel <malay>tu</malay>
I remember when we just came in into the hotel
first is the smell
we feel the it's like the smell of
[ah] something being kept for so long
it's not rotten [ah] it's like the carpet never wash for so long
[ah] [lah]
[kan] <malay>bila kita sampai</malay>
<malay>bilik tu macam</malay> okay everything go like so olden
[kan] [ah] [ah] so after <malay>lepas dah</malay> the <malay>bilik tu</malay> okay [lah] but overall
quite enjoyable [lah] in #jakarta# the
different way of life
[ah]
yes
yes our wedding
[ah] our wedding planner [ah]
[ah] [ah]
(uh huh) [ah] yes
yes correct [ah] [ah]
(um) [ah]
[ah] the third
[ah]
hotel
basically is [ah] it's all paid for
the tour is [ah]
the tour is all planned [ah] so the driver the vehicle all all is provided
basically we are just supposed to
be there
and everything is actually planned for us we just follow [eh]
[ah]
testing [ah] [ah]
#tanah abang#
yes
[ah]
so sometimes [kan] you have to buy <malay>kadang-kadang macam apa</malay>
have to buy clothes same pattern but different colours [kan]
just for the sake of
[ah] getting (err)
cheaper cheaper price [ah] [kan]
because [ah] <malay>dorang tak jual</malay>
they don't sell by one piece one piece
they sell by [oh] you must buy at least three must buy at least four and
so that's why <malay>kadang bila kita</malay> when
we went there I think I saw some
some faces which are familiar maybe they are from singapore
(err)
<malay>dorang beli</malay> to sell at their shop <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
is money yes
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah]
ask for directions
<malay>nak pergi</malay> [ah]
<malay>itu bukan itu aja</malay> even someone who
open the door for us
just holding the door still will be expecting us to
to <malay>kasi duit</malay>
then <malay>dia hulur tangan dia minta duit ni semua</malay> [kan] [ah]
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] [kan] so other than that
[ah]
ya other than #jakarta# we went to [ah]
[ah] indonesia <malay>juga</malay> #bali# <malay>juga</malay>
is a couple so called couple retreat [ah] two couples [ah]

down there <malay>pun</malay> our friend is a hindu [kan]

looking out for us and
so we we feel safe [ah] then
[ah] the hotel it was [ah] #harris# hotel [a'ah]

in terms of the hotel is is nice [lah] not old not
over not so that impressive but
[ah] okay [lah]

[ah] the way they set up but of course a bit different [lah] first the
the cleanliness of the beach
<malay>tak kotor sangat tapi</malay> to me is [ah]

[ah] we enjoyed a lunch down there
ya <malay>cantik memang cantik</malay> but the place <malay>tempat makan tu</malay> it's like all the buildings

the prime minister then even though they are from opposition
party [kan] so it's that bad [lah] [kan] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>memang nasib kita baik</malay> [lah] <malay>kita dapat pergi</malay>

<malay>mana-mana kita nak pergi tanya</malay> flood <malay>ke tak</malay> flood <malay>ke tak kalau dia kata</malay> (um) [ah] longer way (uh huh)
[ah] then one thing about #penang# ya I remember which is interesting is that
they like to conserve the old buildings
so <malay>macam kalau apa</malay> even if it's a new shopping centre
but the front part of the building <malay>tu di apa</malay>
they conserve so they make it part of the building [kan] which is [ah] a bit
a bit <malay>macam</malay> odd [lah] something good
but
[kan] <malay>kadang macam nampak sangat beza dia</malay>
conserve for the sake of [ah] conserving [ah] sometimes it doesn't really look
matching
ya but I I respect them [lah] cause they did conserve their [ah]
upside down museum [ah] (um)

we try to work things out [kan] so <malay>kalau macam</malay>
of course [lah] <malay>kadang ada orang</malay> selfish <malay>apa</malay> [kan] so if
that person selfish <malay>tak nak</malay> cooperate [kan]

[kan] <malay>tapi kepala dia ada kepala otak jadi yang kepala otak tu yang</malay> decide <malay>nak</malay> turn <malay>atau tidak</malay>
[a'ah]
(mm)
ya [kan] so <malay>sebab itu kita</malay> as a <malay>keluarga</malay> we are as a unit [kan] so we want to move we want to move as a unit
<malay>kalau ada orang tak nak dengar ini</malay> [kan] then <malay>kalau dia dah sampai apa kalau dia tak nak buat</malay>
<malay>dia tak</malay>
affect <malay>tak nyusahkan orang lain tak apa tapi sekarang dia buat dia menyusahkan orang lain dan dia rasa dia tak bersalah</malay> then
really have to <malay>apa</malay> explain and I really have to go
go and settle the issue [lah] [kan] so the issue now is whether <malay>dapat</malay> settle <malay>ke tak</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> hopefully <malay>akan dapat</malay> settle [lah] [kan]
<malay>dia nak hidup sendiri tu dia punya pasal</malay> [lah] [kan] I don't want to <malay>halang</malay>
<malay>kalau dia nak</malay> [kan] <malay>kita akan</malay> we are

in terms of <malay>nak dapat sekolah tu susah nak cakap</malay> [lah] [kan]
[ah] yes
[ah]
[ah]
<malay>ubat</malay>
[ah] yes
[ah] cousin [ah]
<malay>tergantung</malay> it's very <malay>susah</malay> [lah] then
things are moving smoothly if I only can try my best [lah]
I I submit document I submit application
<malay>semua dah buat</malay> [kan]
[ah]
[ah]
the thing is is like that
[kan] <malay>kata orang tu</malay> [kan]
because they are two different
organisation if they are under one
organisation of course it's smoother [lah] [kan]
but now the organisation <malay>bukan satu tempat</malay>
they are two different organisations so <malay>yang ini tempat</malay> check
<malay>yang ini untuk</malay>
[ah] <malay>masa depan</malay>
for future <malay>yang ini untuk apa</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia punya apa bantuan lain bantuan lain</malay> so
have to go through a lot of places [lah]
whether it will improve <malay>ke tak</malay>
the future
<malay>tak juga dia</malay> different criteria [kan] like example <malay>kalau macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> in order to apply for example [ah] to apply for need
[ah] certification that he is autistic then <malay>dah pergi</malay> minds minds <malay>dah</malay> certify <malay>dia dah</malay> [ah] settle
then after that <malay>nak masukkan dia sekolah nak masukkan dia sekolah pula</malay> [oh]
certification from (uh) minds <malay>tak cukup</malay>
you have to go through a certain
[ah] doctor [lah] doctor or hospital or what okay so <malay>pergi</malay> doctor <malay>punya</malay> hospital
happen doctor hospital <malay>tu pun</malay> [ah] okay [lah] willing to help okay he did that part
then after that <malay>bila nak</malay> apply for <malay>apa</malay> for <malay>apa</malay> cash in life for home caregiving [kan] [oh]
cannot we only we only accept those who are <malay>apa</malay>
authorised by us to do the [ah] assessment so go through check up again
so (um) (um)
[ah] [ah]
<malay>risiko</malay> there and the the thing is
okay [lah] <malay>macam cakap macam macam kita ni</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> for <malay>macam untuk adik ni</malay>
I am willing to <malay>usaha</malay> [kan] and I happen I got a cousin is willing to support [lah]
so <malay>kita kena buat</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi macam</malay> you try imagine
<malay>kalau</malay> [lah] all these checks
are done are simplified that means only one time check and then it's done [kan]
settle
but because all the different organisation got different criteria then [ah]
yes correct and the thing is <malay>pula</malay>
<malay>kita pergi</malay> check up <malay>ni bukan</malay> free
everytime <malay>pergi</malay>
[ah] <malay>kena bayar ke apa</malay> [kan] but so far I'm lucky in the sense minds <malay>tolong</malay>
<malay>percuma</malay> free
[ah] even the hospital [one] happen epilepsy <malay>punya</malay> doctor [kan] so there is no extra charges [lah] and
[ah] so <malay>nanti</malay> Q cure <malay>ni kalau macam apa</malay>
in order <malay>dah dapat</malay> cash in life [lah] <malay>apa ni semua</malay> cash in life [lah] <malay>pula nak kena</malay> assessment [kan]
and then the assessment <malay>pun</malay> need another set of [ah] check up

<malay>tak tu</malay> <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>soalan cepumas dia saya tak tahu boleh ke tak tapi kita cuba kita tak tahu</malay>
you know you may not know until you take
risk
but ya [lah] I mean like
evolve after that then probably like be a teacher
yes dreams of course I'm old we're old man we have to need to
what do you expect
I I ran around (err)
(um) the secondary school area here
ya just like
few rounds [lah]
and then I exercise a bit at the fitness corner I mean it's important to keep yourself healthy you know (um) okay badminton once in a while
you know
nowadays
food
a lot of
process food
and then like you won't get to like
burn the
chemical a lot [lah] then end up getting cancer and all that
this important [lah]
what was this though the badminton
[ah]
ya
!whoa! I didn't know that
!wow! what
how is that possible
!wow!
!wow!
okay [lah] I mean it's not that tiring
if you know how to might manage your time <malay>macam</malay> okay one day badminton then one day
<malay>gini</malay> but evolve is just
something I wanna do
two to three years down the road
then I can take like
until like
from there or something
ya
ya it's important it's important to have smart goals you know
what do you mean
I usually run (um) <malay>macam</malay> about
five to four days a week [ah]
so
kind of everyday but just like weekends <malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay> rest <malay>penat sangat</malay> [kan]
and I'm so taking my part time degree so
quite tiring
so whenever I've
when school starts then whenever I've
free time then I try my best to run [lah]
and
(uh) and
you know my job
like
they
under
they will
I mean this field is quite underpaid [lah] so I'm trying to find jobs that I can you know
like
secure myself financially
(um)
maybe
two K two K plus <malay>pun jadi</malay> [seh]
yours also I heard it's not two K right
(mmhmm)
the internet also they want experience as I mean like I don't know how am I supposed to find a starting job to get all these experiences in a good company
that's true like singaporean nowadays they have this kind of problem I mean foreigners you know <malay>dekat</malay> (um)
I mean it's it's common [lah]
but
everywhere now you go like you need experience and this you know
for people like us
<malay>kasi</malay> [lah] you know chance <malay>sikit</malay> [kan] <malay>tutup mata satu</malay> [kan] and just [orh] come
without any experiences in training will be provided [kan] <malay>boleh</malay> [pe] and
training <malay>apa</malay> internship they don't even pay much so you still expect us to have experiences that this a bit too much [ah] honestly
but I hope I hope you do find you know job that you can be you know
stable financially you know support your parents you know that
honestly
super hard you like
about hundred percent ten per cent [jer] companies who does that
like they
they don't appreciate you they
once you do something bad
it tarnishes your whole reputation
everything your hard work all gone
[kan] <malay>susah nak dapat</malay> company <malay>yang</malay> you know really
focuses on your
[ah] employees welfare
you know and job progression is super important
job progression
yes sure
!wow!
that's unfair
how old is she
she's two years younger and she's the head of your
team
!wah! that's a bit unfair
[orh] it's this happens a lot you know politics in the company and
I mean there are no
chances that
the moment you change companies I mean change jobs
it's gonna be perfect you still gonna face this kind of
issues you know work life issues and
I don't know [lah] this life that's
that sucks but
it's important nowadays that
company
you know take into account
I mean that's why
(um)
exist
ya so and anything complain [jer]
ya with no power to change
nothing no control over
you know this kind of things
you know
I am a student care teacher
(err) basically I just supervise the kids [lah]
(um) you know
make sure ensure
their safety is well taken care of hygiene
and you know we're
make sure they stick to their routine
like <malay>baca buku</malay> about homework
and then mark their assessment books
but the funny thing is
my boss said that
(um)
they're not academically inclined
but
when the kid
read books
at certain timing
they get scolded
because their assessment books are
incomplete
so like you're contradicting yourself <malay>macam apa apa kau nak dari budak-budak ni</malay>
like you say you want them to rest you just focus on discipline <malay>macam tak kisah dorang buat apa</malay> but then
a moment later you're there changing the
there was [oh] <malay>kena buat</malay> assessments [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah]
that kind of thing so I'm a bit confused <malay>yang budak-budak ni kesian</malay> [kan] <malay>dah balik sekolah penat</malay>
<malay>satu hari dah belajar abeh balik</malay>
the student care and
when you
eat also you wanna talk
you can't
talk at all you <malay>masuk bilik</malay>
start <malay>belajar</malay>
homework
and <malay>tak boleh baca buku</malay>
<malay>sampai habis</malay> assessment book
like
ya
exactly
student care
care
for a reason right need to care
for their well-being <malay>macam</malay> okay I get it you care for their well-being you feed them
you you know you them <malay>macam</malay> shelter but
okay [lah] <malay>kalau makan pun takkan tak boleh berbual abeh terus pergi minum air pastu</malay>
<malay>masuk belajar</malay>
<malay>nak keluar lepas tu nak keluar minum air pun tak boleh</malay> [tau]
and because you drink water already just now so like you have to stay in the room for an hour without drink water without any toilet breaks
yup and you do homework
<malay>kalau</malay> rest <malay>pun</malay> ten minute
and there's no nap time
they know the the funny thing is they know the timetable
and they know what they have been doing
but
I know right my company the withdrawal rate is quite high [ah] maybe because of that you know kids complain <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>penat</malay> you know I don't want to go student care anymore
torturing so
a lot of people
quitting [lah] actually like one month <malay>macam</malay> about seven
a lot
that's the thing
ya and I can't even laugh with them
I can't even
talk to them
I need to scold every time they can't even will sit <malay>macam</malay> you know sit like
like
they fold their legs fold <malay>pun tak boleh</malay>
yes they have to sit <malay>macam</malay> you know upright sit properly
in all the time
that's the thing you just imagine yourself in student care
can you imagine
I mean like no one to control you and all that you just do your own things your parents don't force it upon you I mean we do get guidance
but it's more of a freedom of choice
we were allowed to make
choices
and now we become adults
who knows how to make
you know our own choices <malay>macam budak-budak ni</malay> like <malay>kesian</malay> [kan] <malay>semua benda kena</malay>
spoon feed around and then like they grow up becoming like
okay what do I do now
was that a routine no
you know that kind of thing
okay [lah] I mean like this generation is different from back then
okay how about your job scope
I wanna know
it's okay just tell me
[oh] ya I did [oh] my god I miss her so much (um)
her wedding okay she just move out recently
and [ah] I met man the house so so empty

<malay>dapat</malay> and okay <malay>kahwin</malay> and like
<malay>dan</malay> you know but but some people out there you know still finding for
<malay>jodoh semua ni susah</malay> [lah] I mean like but
it's important to go with the flow you know

come

but I heard you and your
your boyfriend has been together for
for years right

I mean get your own space get your own time get to talk to me
okay [lah] take your time take your time
ya that's true
you know
life has no template they say
you know
there's no schedule so
go with the flow
[oh] I love that
I need to write that's
a perfect quote
(um) me and my family okay
I don't know [eh] I mean like I'm so used to being the second child
and like you know there no responsibilities we still have [eh] have fun and enjoy and when then now that
my older sister is gone
like
they're relying on me
so
I I think I have to be the bigger person right now but I'm still coping cause I don't know how
I don't know I'm really I'm lost
but
okay [lah] slowly slowly maybe I get to learn stuff
but I'm still at a stage whereby
I focus on myself a lot
and I'm scared that
you know I might
I might
lose
the responsibility
<malay>macam</malay> like I don't know I I will learn from it [lah]
I mean like
how about that okay
give me some tips
since you are the older child
[oh] man
I saw this post and they said that (um)
the first child
<malay>macam</malay> they will get like a set of rules
and then and gradually the second third child right it
it kind of
(um) ya pass off so
<malay>macam</malay> it's kind of unfair
but at the same time you you are nurtured
(um)
how to say not perfect but then
better better than the second and
third [lah]
so that's why like I'm lost right now but then you are the eldest we're like okay okay I get this right I get that right
so ya [lah] are the pros and cons
but
I I hope you know your brothers you know we learn from you you know as a role model because I look up to you also
cringe
(mm)
that's true
that's true
and no wonder I'm friends with you
(um) okay talking about sweet right
I scared [leh] I scared of diabetes
<malay>macam takut</malay> [tau] okay you know like they say <malay>macam</malay> when you
(um)
when you buy <malay>buang air kecil</malay> [kan] then like there's ends
then like
then like
there is signs of you
that get
like
how to say <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada kencing manis gitu</malay>
in my family <malay>punya</malay> history
<malay>ada</malay> okay my my dad is a diabetic patient
my my grandma is both sides grandma my
my grandpa <malay>macam semua ada</malay> this history of
diabetic
don't you <malay>takut</malay> [seh] say like you know I'm young and you know I love peach tea I love you know
his deserts you
<malay>takut</malay> [lah] I mean like I have to take care of my diet [lah]
of course
but
have you heard of it the
ants
[oh] my
I'm sorry
the heart the sugar intake is quite high [lah]
but
okay the thing I am confused about right
like
they say it's not the sugar but it's actually the carbo
because it's
okay like okay
basically if you are
diabetic right you have to eat low food
glycemic index
glycemic index and high glycemic index comes from rice
white rice
so I am like [oh] okay <malay>jap</malay> white bread is high
white rice high okay where is the sugar that's that's the thing people get confused about sugar or
carbs
and then I I went to research about it
actually it's true
like
rice is the cause of it
and you know like
things that are that are easily processed
but you if you eat whole grain
is lower
lower so that you
okay <malay>macam</malay>
the sugar tends to break down slower so that
insulin <malay>tak pakai banyak</malay> even insulin is working perfectly
to combat the sugar
except for white rice and
(mm)
then you think we are malays is in we eat
okay like
rice is a staple food for us
that's the thing <malay>kuah lemak apa</malay> [ah] cholesterol [oh] my god okay there's so much things we have to take care of
I mean I don't mind eating salad
but
the options
<malay>dekat kedai ada ke jual</malay> salad like hawker centre
I mean you can get back that at subway at what eight dollars for salad
we we can buy that for what one dollar than the sauce <malay>kita beli</malay> like ten dollar but then
<malay>pakai tu</malay>
you save so much
that's true <malay>beli</malay> like <malay>banyak</malay> then after that <malay>simpan</malay> in the fridge
<malay>abeh busuk</malay>
one to two days
!wah! this is
this is the thing [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
is quite hard
to live you know perfectly balanced life nutrition <malay>nak</malay> physically active [lah] <malay>abeh</malay> busy [lah] <malay>dengan kerja</malay>
ya that's true
I mean I've seen a lot of people you know having hard time coping that's why you know like
nutritionist exist to <malay>macam</malay> lead them
<malay>itu semua pakai duit</malay> [seh] do it see I mean like everything revolves around money nowadays
like why can't you just love is free yes
okay love is free
(err) love <malay>pun susah dapat</malay> like
I think like we're at that age
where everything is just hard
is it a twenty two
no no no
twenty two curse
that's true and parents nowadays also working <malay>abeh balik dah tidur</malay> you know that kind of thing
and ya [lah] it's hard but then that images via weekends are always important you know for us to like you have quality family time but nowadays youngsters weekend <malay>gi mana</malay>
we <malay>lepak dengan kawan</malay> but I mean it's not wrong but okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> balance [lah] okay one day with your parents one day [oh] I've heard of this story before <malay>satu</malay> okay there's this one (um) student right
<malay>dia punya</malay>
(um) <malay>makcik tinggalkan</malay>
her
grandfather
[ah] abandoned him <malay>dekat</malay> bus stop <malay>dekat</malay> malaysia
and then drove back home
and left him there
<malay>balik rumah dia</malay>
malaysia [lah]
singapore
[ah] <malay>dia tinggalkan</malay> [ah] <malay>dia letak</malay> bag <malay>suruh orang lain jaga tak tahu siapa</malay> [ah]
intention
yes they don't want to take responsibility for him
and then (um) they receive a phone call from the dad (um) the dad call another [lah] his son [lah] another son
<malay>cakap</malay> (um) <malay>bapa nak balik</malay> you know that kind of thing and the son also <malay>tak cari bapa dia</malay> for one month
then went there
and <malay>nampak bapa dia dekat</malay> old folks home
and he said the father said okay me home [lah] then then they say like [oh] it's okay we come next week
again because it's late
they went back
and their father pass away
the father say it's okay I can live in your store room also
the father pass away
ya that's true <malay>macam</malay> you know
maybe the financially <malay>dorang tak boleh</malay> handle the debt
or just maybe tired you know nowadays <malay>banyak macam</malay> drama drama you know
typical but I didn't know you know this kind of thing exist in real life I always watch it in <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>ni ya allah tak baik</malay> [seh]
but ya it does exist
and you know the kid is traumatised because of what's happening you know this kind of thing all affect
the the kids ya
the kids now the kids <malay>ada sekarang</malay> trauma issues
you know
that's true that's true
I mean like
you wouldn't realise that you actually following your parents but then because if they watching it all your life and is this rooted in you
you know and
there's such thing called karma
so you treat your parents like that your your son your daughters gonna treat same thing same way you treat your parents so ya that's why I'm scared I really had to take care of my parents not because it's not just because of karma
ya [lah] they've taken care of me well <malay>apa kecil-kecil kasi makan</malay> this a way for us to repay back
that's true <malay>macam</malay> it it
safety is vector
but it's actually quite good [leh]
because
(um) doing this kind of thing it helps her reduce the dementia <malay>punya</malay> chances
of (um)
you know
the occurring the occurrence of
dementia
so [ah]
how old is she now
but the around
(oo)
I think more the the the the over sixty five [lah]
definition of
(um) <malay>lepak</malay> or relaxing at her old age
you know just having the freedom to go out you know like breathe I I mean like if I'm her also I will
<malay>bosan</malay> [seh] <malay>duduk dekat rumah</malay> you know like the whole thing like
no fresh air I'll be like
lonely at least we go out where you'll get to people watch you know
just watch people walk
and
I I enjoy people watching honestly so I can relate to your grandma
(oo) that I like the question (mm)
(um) I
think [kan] I would
probably would love
love
to
just
(um)
around
okay [ah]
paris area
london because
I don't know <malay>macam</malay> singapore
is it so rushing
everyone is rushing to get here to get coffee only <malay>ni semua nak merebut</malay> [lah] but then
I have heard a lot of people saying that
you know if you really want to chill chill mango <malay>pergi dekat</malay> paris
just <malay>duduk minum kopi</malay> and you
the rest of them are chilling as well
I want that kind of environment you know just to experience
being chillax you know (um)
ya [lah] but that's my goal [lah]
just
ya you how about you
<malay>cantiknya</malay>
like literally you know
there's something very intriguing about
their culture the way they relax I don't know
I feel like singapore just need to chill a bit [lah]
it's just too fast pace but
<malay>ada</malay> pros and cons <malay>juga</malay> fast
pace I mean we're we're successful to certain extent <malay>macam</malay> economy !wah! <malay>jangan cakap</malay> [ah]
but
ya [lah]
<malay>lepak sikit</malay> [lah]
and like
you know the population <malay>pun sekarang</malay> <malay>macam</malay> a lot of older generation as compared to know like like
people like us
so I feel like it's
quite important to just
kind of chill
and take a step back
but you know who are we to control [kan]
I mean it's not weird I mean
it's valid
for you to feel that way because
if me I wouldn't be able to
cope with five kids
<malay>pun</malay>
I mean <malay>rezeki tu</malay> okay [lah] there's <malay>rezeki tu datang dari</malay> very you know
god but like
I don't know and
okay if you are in the country or if you're wealthy it's a different thing but then we are in singapore you know
<malay>makan pun berapa dah berapa</malay> dollar okay <malay>nak beli</malay> pampers <malay>nak beli ini</malay> and
five times five
if I have a high paying job I don't mind
but then what
what are the odds you know you don't know
and
five kids is a lot
a lot to juggle I can't even handle like one
crying baby
why
how
(mm)
we're like that okay
but
I feel like ya I mean like if you have
something to work towards to
I mean you get motivated [what]
in certain way
but
to me <malay>macam</malay> house work is not an issue
I mean I would love to have a maid [lah] I've never been living with a maid before <malay>macam sedap</malay> [kan] <malay>ada orang kemaskan</malay> you and all that
but
it all
comes back to being success successful in the end
she's now why we have to pay ourself
are you planning to take any courses in the future I mean like apart from your specialist diploma
like degree or something
the fees and everything is it
which uni are you looking at
I mean that's good [lah]
planning is
everything
honestly I mean like
you don't just
go <malay>macam</malay> okay (err) go with the flow <malay>macam</malay> go with the flow <malay>sangat</malay> you know
like
[eh] okay
but like
ya [lah]
I mean like
so you took one year gap
ya
[oh] I took a one year gap also
you didn't know after graduation I took a one year gap
ya we did we both did I remember
it's like
okay to me <malay>macam</malay> one year gap is quite productive [leh] like you just take one year to just
think about what you want
actually that's true I mean like you wasted a year
and when your friends are all like progressing already and then you are one year back
so (um) and when that one year gap makes you lazy actually
makes you very lazy it's because
momentum <malay>dah hilang</malay> [tau] <malay>hilang</malay> graduate
<malay>abeh dah tak belajar</malay> [eh]
<malay>macam</malay> #shiok# <malay>dah naik</malay> #shiok#
so <malay>macam</malay> if if you were just to continue and break that one year gap I think we will be more successful but things happens for a reason so ya we are where we are
meant to be
that's why I believe [lah] so that
I mean if you keep thinking about the one year gap you get depressed eventually
because like you will regret
ya
[oh] man why didn't you reach out to me
we were have been talking for what seven years and you didn't know I took a one year
gap come on
no I
after I graduated
I work okay
may I I graduated <malay>kirakan macam</malay> april [lah] [eh] <malay>dah habiskan</malay>
then I
kept up
till november <malay>terus</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay>
do they work part time also
I didn't know that
I didn't know that at all
so where do you get the money from
you need like
that's the thing I know you were good at savings I know you had like
!wah! a lot of saving so you were have been using your savings during that one year gap
pro
pro
pro
[oh] my
god okay okay but not to make you depressed or anything it's okay it's okay things happens for a reason I mean you are not where you are right now
if it wasn't because of the one year gap
you might have been in uni
and you are struggling you will never know
I feel like you
you are successful you you just don't know that
you don't know I mean now you have so much experience
and uni look at that you know
I mean like they really look at experience you know what have you been doing since you graduated they focus on that
ya that's true and I heard that is a good school
so better [lah] aim for it and there's a lot of my friends <malay>yang</malay>
they didn't get accepted in uni but they work then after that they apply again and they get
they got in because of the work experience so I feel like you have higher chances of
getting
the <malay>punya</malay>
intake
but #inshallah#
I mean like you can I can [lah] I have known you for seven years you're so hardworking
I mean uni hard is going to be hard I mean you need hard like uni life is gonna be hard
but ya [lah] you can manage your time well
so
I feel like you can [lah]
and is good because you are taking full time right
answer me
what what what which course are you planning to get
I mean you just mainly just look at your major [what] minor you can choose later cause major okay what marketing is it what
what which part
so minor I mean you can minor in <malay>apa</malay> organisational behaviour right those type of thing right
ya
I think minor minor in business or what
minor is just
literally the word minor is minor
the major one is a major
you get what I mean
ya so
but marketing is
on demand nowadays
right
[oh] <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
and
healthcare also
I mean like you can market
but under healthcare [what]
why not
[oh] ya I forgot
doctor times
okay
ya but I have heard about it
[eh] I'm but I'm planning to
I'm planning to
going under healthcare also
like under social work
now after this feel cause I'm tired of teaching
just tired of
watching kids suffering
so maybe I will get back to it later
you know you know I'll just explore and
this is the thing I heard you know I don't like when people generalise
us
as job hoppers
ya I mean like it's hard to change one's mind also we can only change our minds
so they are going to continue looking us as job hoppers
but
to me
I mean depends [ah] on the situation <malay>kalau nak</malay> job hop just because [oh] you can't take it anymore that's a different thing but if you want a job hope to get experience you know different fields
why not <malay>macam</malay> you're still young you need to know what you really want in life <malay>kalau tak</malay> experience <malay>macam mana</malay> [seh]
like you know you just going to be stuck
you know mundane for the rest of your life
I'm
but
it's just
it's just not how our generation works nowadays you know we need to find what we love to actually
progress <malay>betul-betul macam</malay> you know be successful
ya that's why passion is important to me
how is it possible
is it a typo or what
[oh] my god that is ridiculous okay <malay>merepek gila</malay>
but
okay [lah] I mean there are so many expectations of us
<malay>macam</malay> we are barely okay
I'm not
try to
I mean there is
people our age
like with so many <malay>macam</malay> experience and really capable
but
<malay>takkan nak sama</malay> okay over generous everyone as the same
you know some people are the weaknesses some people have the different strengths
and
I mean don't
don't over expect too much and also don't <malay>macam</malay>
you know like <malay>letak kita kat bawah sangat</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dorang macam</malay> [eh] <malay>korang ni tak ada apa-apa</malay> [ah] just nothing you know
middle [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
borderline you know that kind of thing
so I really hope that one day we will find the jobs
we were really passionate about [lah]
that's true <malay>macam</malay> like
I always watch like movies you know <malay>macam</malay>
okay like they get into jobs they like right they work they have progression and all that
and <malay>macam susah</malay> [lah] <malay>dapat</malay>
in singapore
because all those movies are
always based on other other countries you know
<malay>macam</malay> america <malay>ni semua</malay>
I don't know like
okay like
sometimes I do have thoughts <malay>macam</malay> if we want to be like
overseas you know working overseas will we be success more successful like [oh]
you know as compared to in singapore
you get what I mean
[ah] okay okay this now is a fun topic okay I don't know where but I like [ah] rom com
you know romantic comedy
those kind and I like thrills also thrills movies
ya so anything that keeps my adrenaline you know rush because I'm an adrenaline junkie
how are you
so what type like
like usually you Netflix
!wow!
!wow! I barely have time for that
do you watch modern family
[oh] my god you should watch you should watch it's funny
[oh] is it good
it's funny
it's it's cute
okay okay
is it okay I didn't know that I mean like I always
[oh] I mean I I've seen
everyone like posting about stranger things
<malay>apa ni</malay> is stranger things
but like okay [lah] I I might watch it one day but you should watch modern family
it's hilarious
hilarious
okay but if you watch modern family with someone
it's funnier
then watching alone probably like (uh)
okay [lah] funny but [eh] quite boring
not boring
but like it's
nicer with someone
exactly and I'm single as hell
[oh] that's so sweet
<malay>ada</malay>
I mean I wanna watch but I don't wanna get stuck
on on it you know
like people play like among us
but like I don't
I really want to try but I don't want to get stuck on it
is it a hype or is it just for a while
I see okay
that make sense
but I can see you is the type of person who can control you know you have
quite
a decent self control <malay>punya</malay> tolerance but me
I can't like I don't have self control
like once I'm indulge into that [kan] <malay>habis</malay>
it's over for me so I tend I tend to <malay>macam</malay> you know prevent from this kind of thing like okay ya maybe let me indulge with healthier thing that's why I'm joining like #muay thai# gym
know things that
you know are healthy
and
ya I don't mind spending
over
time on it
alright [oh] my god it sounds like a plan
okay
it's been long since I start playing you know
games
and ya [lah] I mean like
we are twenty two what do you
expect
we rarely [oh] my god did you overcook
it's because it's so hard
is it okay which one the the older one or
[eh] the younger one
[eh] wait wait wait wait
the
the youngest
[oh] are you serious
you don't play with the second one
I see boring
but
ya [lah] I
I mean I love four
for I usually waste money on play nation <malay>ni semua</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> waste of money [lah] so I stop playing games
but overcook is fun
switch is simple <malay>kau macam</malay> you can bring it around <malay>pastu boleh main</malay>
that's true that's true
I mean but
ya [lah] I mean
I'm trying my best to not spend
not spend on stuff that are unnecessary I mean like
there's a lot of things I wanna do I wanna shop you know I wanna shop for facial stuff makeup
<malay>baju ni semua</malay> but I'm trying my best not to
because
I feel like overspending I won't be able to save
in the future
do you invest in anything
I see [eh] wait where does he where <malay>macam mana dia</malay> invest
on so every month
I see but how much does he save per month
<malay>tak sikit</malay> [kan] that's the thing
I only invest on every month I just <malay>kasi macam</malay> hundred seventy <malay>gitu</malay>
and for fifteen years [ah] then <malay>macam ada</malay> you will get back like a lump sum
(um) and in case if you were to <malay>macam</malay> touch wood [lah] <malay>macam</malay> pass away or anything like
you will get
more
than what you save
<malay>macam</malay>
hundred K
how to get [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
I mean it's quite
reassuring [lah] to know that
you know these thing which are the backup plan <malay>gitu</malay>
ya so I feel like you should you should invest on
I mean I can I can like brief you through it [lah]

all these investment and all that kind of stuff

<malay>nanti kat atas</malay> it's a dragon <malay>tapi</malay> usually <malay>dia orang tak ada duit nak habiskan</malay> the dragon so it's just a koi fish at the forearm
seriously I
I kena like <malay>tiga orang</malay> who have the exact same tattoo and they stop at the exact same spot
<malay>sebab tak cukup duit</malay>
why do you think I saved up money for three years when I wanted to get tattoo
<malay>tak ada</malay> colour [ah]
colour <malay>mahal</malay> [sia]
I don't know [ah] depends on the quality [one] [ah]
obviously I I I didn't do much research [ah] I didn't want a koi fish tattoo I wanted a pirate [one]
you know it will be like like
!huh!
!wah!
ask her to do an apprenticeship [ah]
what the fuck
<malay>apa</malay> [sia]
[eh] <malay>korang boleh maki tak</malay>
man
I wouldn't I don't I wouldn't trust myself [sia]
number one <malay>sakit</malay> [eh] later you like you tattoo yourself after that you <malay>pengsan macam mana</malay>
then just like later <malay>pengsan</malay> then the line like drag across across your body
you know like when you're writing ya but you're like in class then later <malay>tertidur</malay> youppo
<malay>apa berkam apa</malay> [sia]
cuppin
the one you bought after you exercise
[ah] ya ya ya
(uh huh)
!woo!
[oh] that's cool
<malay>macam</malay> tattoo
[eh]
it's like test test <malay>dulu</malay> [ah]
[ah] cause
because when you do like that kind of like hand
hand gun one right I'm sure it's gonna hurt a lot more than when you use a gun
cause the gun is going in and out it's very fast so you <malay>tak rasa sangat</malay>
or like you <malay>rasa</malay> for a shorter amount of time cause it's <malay>masuk keluar masuk keluar</malay>
well with the hand [one] it's like the person <malay>cucuk</malay> one by one slowly I'm sure it's gonna hurt more
I mean as compared to a
machine gun like a machine electronic machine
I'm sure it's not that fast [lah]
ya
you [tau] [ah] I <malay>lagi sikit</malay> I <malay>bila</malay> I went to mexico [kan]

<malay>merepek</malay> [sia]
what time you <malay>balik</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
[ah]
ya okay [lah] that's not too bad that time my last reservist cycle fell like <malay>turun</malay>
hand over shift
<malay>tujuh setengah</malay> [kan]
and then after that I I didn't turn out for call I <malay>malas</malay> so I <malay>tidur</malay> I <malay>tidur</malay> in like the they have like a mass hall but <malay>atas</malay> [ah] on the second floor then the office on the first floor
so every all the everybody else <malay>tidur</malay> on the first floor and then I <malay>tidur</malay> on the second floor
<malay>habis naik atas</malay> like <malay>pukul satu pagi</malay> then I was like [eh] ma'am I I go sleep first [ah] then she like [oh] K K I see you upstairs
<malay>habis tidur</malay>
<malay>bangun pukul sembilan pagi</malay> [sia]

then after that <malay>nak kena</malay> sign out [kan] the reservist <malay>nya</malay> attendance sheet
<malay>habis dia nya</malay>
night shift <malay>nya semua</malay> paramedics [dah] <malay>balik</malay> then I was like [eh] <malay>encik macam mana</malay> [sia] then he's like [ah] never mind I sign for you I sign for you
reservist
<malay>takkan nak begitu</malay> [sia] [lah]
<malay>balik</malay> on the dot [sia]
actually not really [lah] I used to stick around a lot also
ya
okay I'll
(mm)
(mm)
night shift I wasn't like that [ah] because yours is twenty four hour shift so you always finish in the morning [kan]
for me if I night shift then I finished in the morning [kan]
<malay>dulu</malay>
[orh] me and my friends <malay>selalu keluar</malay> eat breakfast [lah] so we leave we leave late but it's because we wait for the rest of the medics <malay>balik</malay> station [ah]
ya
last time my rota quite bonded [ah]
one time we <malay>naik basikal</malay>
and then after that my friend like we all cycled halfway already <malay>pergi entah mana nak makan</malay> [lah] or something then my friend <malay>kata</malay> [eh] [sia] [lah] <malay>aku tertinggal aku ni barang</malay> [ah]
then after that we cycled back and then we <malay>masuk</malay> the station like bicyle then we parked the bicycle outside the paramedic office beside the pumper <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>habis dia orang keluar</malay> then after that the #suay suay# the is like !oi! bicycle <malay>siapa ni</malay> then I was like <malay>encik encik bukan saya punya</malay> bicycle
[ah] that's like fucking eight bicycle [sia]
eight bicycles like parked beside the <malay>siapa tak bingit</malay> [sia]
<malay>nasib baik dia orang tak kena</malay>
(mm)
[oh] ya how was it cardiac arrest right
[ah]
cannot [sia]
(mm)
[dah] expect [ah]
(mm)
fuck
ya that's quite rare
I think for the most part my my cardiac arrest
think like only like
twenty percent a quarter of them [ah] <malay>dapat</malay> shock
[ah]
(mm) depends [ah] depends on how far the hospital is depends how fast we reach
ya
<malay>kadang kadang</malay>
no most of the time if <malay>dapat</malay> shock it's usually on scene and then it continue in the ambulance
[oh]
so the pulse [dah] <malay>balik</malay> [ah]
like
when when was the last time they saw him
when was the last time he was seen like healthy
like when was that
no no when was the last time the patient like <malay>dia orang sampai dia</malay> [dah] [dah] gone [kan] so like how long before that did they last see him
[orh] like <malay>depan mata</malay> [ah]
[oh]
why [sia]
ya ya ya
<malay>kadang</malay> [eh] the
when I went back reservist the medic told me <malay>sekarang</malay> they make it compulsory [sia]
all medics
<malay>kena</malay> like you you have to have the my responder app
my time it was like optional
then after that <malay>sekarang dia orang</malay> enforce like you have to download
then after that if you <malay>dapat</malay> the notification <malay>kena pergi</malay> [ah] I mean if you <malay>tak nampak</malay> then #bo pian# [lah] but
they expect you to go
(mm)
[ah]
that's cool
<malay>apa dia orang dapat</malay>
<malay>apa lagi</malay> case (err) the community responder was
the this captain from
(err) division #yishun#
<malay>habis</malay> the this the this captain the the <malay>dia dulu macam</malay> medical officer
so he cover my station sometimes when the paramedics on leave or what
<malay>habis</malay> my my <malay>kawan nampak dia tengah belakang</malay> was like <malay>belakang selalu macam lepak lepak</malay> [ah]
then after that <malay>dia nampak</malay> the captain <malay>dia terus</malay> [eh] [sia] [lah]
my the the responder is captain [ah] then after that he told us <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> take charge of the scenes <malay>semua</malay> then I was like [eh] [sia] [lah] <malay>uar uar</malay> [sia] <malay>aku</malay> give <malay>kau</malay> lesson <malay>engkau buat bodoh</malay> [jer] <malay>macam tu</malay>
so ya
[oh] ya my last
you know my (err) last duty
one of my last few duties [ah] like my (err) the most recent cycle I also got a cardiac arrest and then after that the like we managed to resuscitate [sia] resuscitate the patient <malay>dapat</malay> we gave like I think three or four shocks
[eh] no three shocks then the pulse came back
yeah
ya
that one also quite surprising so
but the <malay>nyonya</malay> was quite <malay>tua</malay> already
then they but the I think it's because
the <malay>dia orang</malay> [dah] <malay>tolong</malay> this <malay>nyonya</malay> out of the toilet then she <malay>terus</malay> collapse so like right from the <malay>mata</malay> [ah] then they immediately call
[eh] usually cardiac arrest <malay>kalau pagi pagi</malay> [kan] it's usually a <malay>macam orang baru bangun baru bangun</malay> then they <malay>jumpa</malay> the body then it's like [dah] <malay>beberap jam</malay> [ah] so that one
like the body without oxygen like after three or four minutes it's like permanently brain dead like let alone like how many hours right so that's why most of the time when you <malay>dapat</malay> cardiac arrest
<malay>tak boleh</malay> save [ah]
ya it's like
pretty much [lah] but most of the time we still try [ah] just to
at least
put in effort
ya
but usually it's very rare [ah] unless like the patient collapse in front of
like
like patient collapse then they straight away call
and start doing [lah]
and <malay>kena buat</malay> <malay>betul betul</malay> [lah] that time <malay>apa lagi</malay>
(err) my last duty in like my last duty ever <malay>kena dapat</malay> call the this #ah pek# he cardiac arrest at a foodcourt
and then after that we <malay>sampai</malay> and then we saw the doctor there was a there was a clinic in front of the food court [ah]
and then after that like a the the passerby called the doctor then the doctor <malay>datang</malay> so when we reached the doctor was doing then the doctor <malay>buat</malay> you know like got a there's a pace [one] when you do it's like one and two and three there's there's like a certain pace you have to follow
to do that kind
ya
then doctor <malay>buat macam macam</malay> jackhammer [sia] don't know [what]
<malay>macam begitu</malay> then after that <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>pukimak ini apa</malay> [sia] <malay>ini</malay> rabbit [pe] and then after that my paramedic my paramedic <malay>tengah jalan</malay>
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> he he stopped walking then he turned he turned around he looked at me then he was like
[sia] [lah] <malay>dia buat apa</malay> [sia] then I was like <malay>betul</malay> in public K <malay>buat betul betul</malay>
the doctor the doctor <malay>buat</malay> <malay>sembarang</malay> then we after that we all like what the fuck [sia] the doctor you know
then he was like like
that's why like <malay>tak tahu malu ke</malay> like
you fucking terrible at until like an has to take over you
and like the that take over wasn't even me it was like I had to ask my junior to do cause I to set up the other equipment
ya so I asked my junior about the physical
why okay [what] actually last time medic
like if you turn out for a cardiac arrest then you get like got two medics in the crew [kan] you will <malay>gaduh</malay> over who gets to do
cause if you do C
everybody wants to do
cause you do is like brainless you just equal the rhythm you keep up the right pressure okay already
[ah]
you if you not doing means you have to set up all the equipment so you <malay>kena letak</malay> the [lah] the set up the set <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> the adrenaline <malay>kasi</malay> the normal saline then like all the small small stuff and then after that if you <malay>buat salah</malay> you <malay>kelam kabut</malay> you don't give it to the paramedic on time <malay>kena maki</malay>
so like everybody will <malay>gaduh</malay> over who gets to do
except for me I I don't like doing so I <malay>penat</malay>
ya
(err) they started right after I
I know my <malay>encik</malay> was the one who came up with the vehicles [sia] there like that was his project
as in
ya that's true
I think ya <malay>tak salah</malay> I heard they got the thing for <malay>macam orang</malay> morbidly obese
like like there's there's stretcher they put inside is so they can convey those kind of patients also
ya
ya
cause the normal the normal alpha <malay>sekarang</malay> is fucking <malay>kecil</malay> [sia] like the old one like the box alpha you you remember right I think your time got the box alpha right
(mm) the ugly one but got a lot of space so that one like you put inside a fucking obese person also <malay>boleh</malay>
<malay>boleh muat</malay>
the new alpha is freaking <malay>sempit</malay> [sia] like a normal sized patient already like a slightly heavy normal size patient is already quite <malay>sempit</malay> already
so I think like the
plus the <malay>dengan</malay> the stretcher [kan]
like you don't need to <malay>angkat</malay> the stretcher like you just <malay>picik</malay> the thing then it's like mechanical then the the legs go up by themselves <malay>bodoh tak nak taruh</malay> in ambulance when we actually convey patients <malay>ke mana yang sedia</malay>
<malay>rabak</malay> [sia]
wait the the guy also a medic [ah] <malay>tu</malay>
[orh] firefighter
[orh] then turn out for
[orh]
ya
actually [ah] the my last cardiac arrest case like <malay>bila balik</malay> reservist <malay>ni</malay> we also turn out with and then after that I <malay>nampak</malay> [kan]
so far <malay>dia orang asyik suruh</malay> the boy <malay>yang buat</malay> then after that <malay>yang lain semua diri kat keluar kesian</malay> [sia]
the firefighting [ah]
so like the so when comes the the ambulance crew like <malay>tak</malay>
like <malay>lepas tangan</malay> so we do all the other stuff like the medical the medical equipment [ah] like we put in the <malay>apa</malay> tubing <malay>semua</malay>
and then after that so like free up free our hands [lah] so the crew <malay>yang buat</malay>
and then after that like I <malay>tak pernah nampak</malay> anyone wearing orange bunker gear <malay>buat</malay> so far is <malay>selalu</malay> the firefighter
like the the green the green one
[ah] [ah]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah]
T shirt [sia]
what you all turn out <malay>pakai</malay> bunker gear [pe]
[ah] [ah] ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya that's what I saw also [ah] when I turn out with them
but fun right
<malay>tak</malay> stress [ah]
(mm)
[eh] wait so were you were you the covering sec com
[oh] then <malay>nasib baik</malay> [sia] <malay>nasib baik ada</malay> the fire fight
[orh] so even then like if even if you turn out the will take charge [lah]
[ah] so so if anything like the will take charge of the call [lah]
what
[ah] ya
<malay>sekarang</malay> it's that's damn short [sia] so <malay>dulu dulu</malay> during my time [kan] the attachment was like two <malay>dua tiga tahun begitu</malay>
[oh] then
[ah] I see I see
ya
[orh] they want to put people into the
[ah]
[eh] but actually now also turn out for
also turn out for cardiac arrest right
ya got some some new thing called
high high intensity or something like that
I don't know what the hell it is [ah] high intensity
ya let me google [ah] high intensity
high performance high performance
so it's like a
it's like a new protocol
so it's like
eight eight people do
ya so it's it says here
eight member crew recalled an incident when they had to do high performance to resuscitate a patient
so like basically the whole and then <malay>semua turun</malay> then after that they take turns doing I don't know what the the the protocol is [ah] like I'm sure there's like some
like procedure like
like a flow to it
to make it more like
<malay>apa</malay>
make it better
I I also don't know
ya so basically right the the people will do the and the alpha people <malay>buat</malay> the medical staff [lah] the <malay>semua</malay>
that kind of thing but ya
I heard they was like they were starting to do it
quite often relatively often
but then <malay>sejak</malay> COVID then they stopped because they want to limit like exposure or whatever
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> fire site
serious
(mm)
then you #suay# [ah]
[eh] but #ons#
I get [lah] if you want to be #ons# but <malay>tapi ko nak kacau</malay> reservists <malay>buat apa</malay> [sia]
<malay>baru juga</malay> [ah]
[oh]
#sian# hopefully your next cycle gets better
double meaning <malay>tu apa</malay> [sia]
what the fuck
so it's basically covering the <malay>punya</malay>
workload and the
(uh huh)
[oh] so if turn out then you <malay>ikut</malay> if turn out also you <malay>ikut</malay> [ah]
[oh] <malay>rabak</malay>
if and turn out at the same time then how
[orh] okay
[oh]
[oh]
<malay>rabak</malay> [pe]
<malay>penat</malay> [ah]
it's like you turning out for two appliances
(mm)
and
<malay>mana siap</malay> [lah] at least you <malay>dapat</malay>
last time <malay>tak ada</malay> [kan] your <malay>tak ada</malay> you get to face
face something new
ya fun right
(mm) you you've seen how it works already [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
I I guess I get what you mean [ah] but it's been a long time since I felt that [ah]
[ah] like I never
[a'ah] <malay>mampus</malay> I I [loh]
last time I remember they they ask us to download when I was in then they say like it's not compulsory but we highly encourage you to download
then after that I think it was during like our talk or something like that
then <malay>macam kawan pekik</malay>
sir I off duty for what want to go collapse then we were like [sia] [lah] I mean I know everyone was thinking it [ah] but you don't have to say it bro
the officer just <malay>bawa</malay> [lah] then he just continue
ya
(mm)
ya you download already [ah]
the my responder app
!huh! [oh] you need the cert [ah] to download
ya <malay>tak</malay> probably [ah]
that's why I was supposed to get the cert
after my last refresher course
it's like every cycle they tell me [ah]
that [oh] you take this course you finish this refresher course we will give you your
certification
then it's like it only last two years
but I already do two cycles <malay>tak pernah dapat</malay> [sia] the card <malay>terlupa</malay>
ya
they said we supposed to get the card also
to say that we are actually certified
ya
then <malay>tak pernah</malay> they never give
(err)
the no [lah] it's not like we go through the full <malay>benda</malay> [lah] cause we already know how to do it what so it's basically
the only thing
is like we get tested on it like the contract indications and what not
and then they have the mannequin <malay>habis kena buat</malay> [lah] then they measure
like our our depth of compression the rate of compression that kind of thing
then if you pass then you will get by right supposed to get the cert [ah]

unusual superpower
(err)
(hmm) I think one of the most obvious ones would be the ability to grow money to grow money because I think (err) if I have all the money in the world I can actually help lots of people ya deep [eh]
which is what you want <malay>teleport</malay>
it is nice ya
teleport
(err) actually I I I said that because like (err) my I was watching this like interview of my favourite celebrity korean celebrity and she said that so I want to emulate it's #hyorin# [lor] #hyorin# the #sistar# [one]
so and I think is a very good (err) superpower superpower cause I think right now (um) you know with money we can actually do lots of stuff
answer politically right answer
I actually saw this (err) one movie recently on netflix right is called I boy
so the is like a sci-fi movie where (err) the story is about this (err) boy who suddenly had the superpower to actually control technology from his mind ya ya so (err) it happened (err) <malay>sebab</malay> one day <malay>dia macam apa tu</malay> he got ambushed or got chased by a group of his classmates
so <malay>dia punya</malay> classmates I mean when the group <malay>macam ada</malay>
gangster gangster <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] ya so like even though they are very young the (err) they know they they they they can handle like dangerous stuff like pistol and drugs ya so that time (uh) <malay>macam dia tengah lari tengah lari</malay> from the <malay>orang</malay> [kan] <malay>abeh</malay> (um) one of them from the bad guy actually <malay>tembak</malay>
<malay>tembak</malay> the the guy so he hit the side of his head [ah] ya so because of that he went to a coma then the doctors said that there were actually fragments of of the phone (err) in his head fragments of a phone in his head ya I know I know I know it sounds stupid [lah] but ya this what is actually what the doctor said ya so because of that he actually got a superpower
(err) to actually (um) see whatever you're typing (err) whatever you are whatever you whatever you are conversing on your phone or whatever that is phone related [lah] and he has the ability to <malay>macam</malay> technology from his mind ya so is it got it got like (err) if you think about it right <malay>macam</malay> there's a lot of things you can do if you can control technology cause technology is everywhere right now in our society which I think is very cool [lah] very cool
ya <malay>cuma macam</malay> now that the movie is he is using his superpower for others (uh) for others for his own good and to help others [lah] I mean <malay>macam</malay> so he helped to track down the the culprits [ah] so the story was (err) <malay>macam apa tu</malay> (uh) this (uh) the neighbourhood is <malay>macam ada apa</malay> [eh]
<malay>macam ada</malay> is run by this (err) drug drug society drug a group [ah] like (err) ya so he helped to track this group down <malay>abeh macam</malay> help the police to do so he he use his technology <malay>macam</malay> to draw them in [lah] to expose on the drugs and dark secrets <malay>dorang ada</malay> to the neighbourhood and to the police
ya so it's it's inspiring [lah] I would say inspiring movie I boy the movie title is I boy but he is a high school student high school (err) high school is it middle school I can't remember okay middle school
[orh] no no no no he's a middle school student ya he also has the ability to draw cash from bank accounts <malay>macam</malay> like (err) ya he can just drain your bank account just like that or also like (err) put in money into your bank account just like that so which is quite cool [lah] ya
ya <malay>ke</malay> [oh] is it that's nice [oh] he more like he targets the the gangsters society but <malay>dia macam</malay> he let them (uh) like he drains all of their bank accounts so that <malay>dorang tak ada</malay> resources
like to turn to [lah] in a sense ya
ya
society society is like what your school your teachers
labels
[orh] (err) usually for me I haven't been I haven't experience (err) any strong stereotypes by my peers or by my the people who I socialise with so I cannot really say much but I know that <malay>macam</malay>
there's always like (err) well known stereotypes (err) within the malay community (err) for example <malay>macam</malay> one very good example would be <malay>macam orang melayu tak pandai tak pandai</malay> in math <malay>gitu</malay> ya from young so and usually like (err) because like <malay>orang melayu suka macam lepak dekat</malay> void deck <malay>gitu</malay> so we are we are we are seen as like lazy people [lor] in a sense ya
which I think (err) <malay>palsu</malay> [lah] because like you as you grow up you will learn to take things on your stride then you will you once you find out what you like and then you will work towards it [what] it's the same for everyone <malay>cuma dulu</malay> is okay [what] to <malay>lepak</malay> cause like last time with your friends just chill chill [lah] like if if you like to me if your if your kind of <malay>lepak</malay> is <malay>main</malay> (err) like computer games or like
or like that kind then your our kind of <malay>lepak</malay> is really like is at the void deck [lah] chit chat <malay>yang main</malay> guitar ya so is the same kind of <malay>lepak</malay> [lah] I mean is just different kind of how you view <malay>lepak</malay> as
I think (err) I think it's is somewhat true [lah] because I think it is somewhat true because like (uh) if you were talking about right there's (um) the number of malay the malay population in is very little ya and some more we are already the minority like (err) there's not a lot of us (err) compared to the chinese the chinese people back in school so it's much much lesser
even though I do agree that (err) there's a smaller percentage of malay people who go to university but (err) to local universities but I know like there's actually a lot of my peers from secondary school who goes the poly then uni route so they still end up in a in a uni is just that they may have gone to (err) <malay>macam</malay> public uni [ah] I mean local uni or private uni but they still go to uni
in the end eventually ya I also have some cases <malay>macam</malay> after poly right they they (err) they do not wish to pursue university cause they already had their career settled back then <malay>macam</malay> if you look at (err) maritime studies [kan] (err) from poly (err) I think I got one friend <malay>yang macam</malay> he he he majored in maritime studies then right now he's always on the ship [one]
he's always on the ship ya travelling I don't know where but I think (err) that kind of job is is quite it piece very well especially if you start from young and I don't think he (um) he is he intends to go uni [ah] because from what I see his career is pretty much set in place ya so
it depends on on on the direction or the career direction that you choose [lah] I think everybody has their has their special everyone has different talents ya what what they are good at what they are bad at ya <malay>macam gitu</malay> [jer] [lah]
<malay>lama</malay> [eh] it's very long
it will be a very rewarding experience
<malay>macam apa tu macam macam nak satu jam</malay> [eh]
education [ah]
subsidised subsidised heavily subsidised for public schools <malay>tapi</malay> when you talk about those non like (err) like we have certain schools in singapore <malay>yang macam</malay> the fees very expensive [kan] so usually like all the rich families will be able to go but not (err) for those families <malay>yang macam tak boleh</malay> afford [lah] because the fees are very expensive even like (um) <malay>macam</malay> if you want to join some of the you have to pay more
ya so I feel like if everyone has equal opportunity (uh) to have to access (err) to access (uh) all these various (uh) resources I think it will be nice [lah] for everyone ya not saying that (err) the elite schools are better than the neighbourhood schools [lah] I'm not saying that I'm just saying that it will it will be nice if
[ah] education is free for all especially when you when when we are talking about those lower income families <malay>yang macam</malay> or those like (err) families <malay>yang macam</malay> <malay>rumah tangga ada masalah</malay> (uh) <malay>mak bapa tak boleh beri</malay> (uh) <malay>tak boleh kasi apa tu</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu tolongan pertolongan kepada</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu anak-anak mereka</malay> so I think this is where it will be nice [lah] if the (err) those families (uh) those kids (um) can
have a deep interest in school ya because we provide them with all the resources basically resources that they can do [lah]
(mm)
ya
you do [lah] but some people just need (err) (err) a bit of that push in the beginning I feel like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> some some kids they wouldn't even think about scholarship they are not interested because they don't even have the drive in them so if you show them or like if you give them a bit (uh) of like resources a bit then they will start to see [orh] this is the reason why we should pursue such things in school [lah] so that you can have greater access then
from there they will work towards (uh) <malay>macam</malay> striving to to get a scholarship
in their head ya
equality versus
equality [ah]
ya I get I get I know ya ya
equity
ya so like if you need more then they give you more if you need less they give you less
everyone has the same amount ya but you are different starting points
[oh] if it is if it's something in that you could wish is free what would it be
time
(err)
so you want the world to freeze the time
vampire
vampire werewolf okay okay if you if you (err) if you if you get to choose right will you be vampire or werewolf
but you have to eat other people for meals <malay>dahsyat</malay> [seh]
(um)

<malay>tak berbulu berbulu-bulu berbulu</malay>
she is one in like ten
of course you can you can change him from a human to a werewolf
society

so what netflix shows are you currently watching now
[oh] have you watched orphan black
it's actually a canadian dramatic conspiracy thriller and science fiction [lah] television series that have like around five seasons the show is actually about a set of clones I think there's more than eight
there's sarah who is a pair of twin she's british in the show
(uh) the other twin his ukrainian
(um) she grew up in a church and seems like she's a nutcase and she's raised she raised (uh) she was raised by the nuns and she was trained by this group they call themselves prolethean who was again science
so the series stars this actress (uh) tatiana maslany
as sarah
a woman who steals the identity of these like suicide victim
(um) (uh) who is one of the clones [lah]
then she always (uh) live like an outsider and she
she was like an orphan
ya so that's pretty much it I mean they show isn't perfect the plot lines are sometimes ludicrous and season three was pretty underwhelming (uh) compared to season two and season four
(mm) I don't feel so emotionally attached to a show in years but this concept about one person playing all the clones (uh) usually could be quite can be a quite disastrous right but this one they have really good writers because and also I think mainly because they have this tatiana this actress right they made the show ten times better than what it should have been so because of her it became like this really masterful performance and then she also won emmy last last year so hopefully because of this shows you we can rise up the back of this [lah]
and beyond that the supporting characters also not bad so there's art donnie felix missus S scott ferdinand what I can remember [lah] because this is the current show I'm watching now
(um)
it's really good and then that there's there's always action in every episode but the thing is this style isn't for everyone but I love it [lah] so you won't get (err) you won't be bored with all the twists and turns and then the scene right between sarah and this clone I will not spoil [lah] because there's a lot of clones in the show in the final episode right is one of my favourite scene in the show so it's quite emotional or can make you cry and I like the way it ended (uh) without spoiling it for you
(err) I think
the tone is what it is but it's something you get used to especially as they dig into the characters more
which is where the show really shines I will give it a few more episodes (uh) actually episode six in season one right is over the top but it's also where a lot of people fell in love with the show if it does nothing for you right it's (uh) probably safe to check out [ah] because if you don't like the first three episode I don't think you are going to like the show because five season is really long for someone to get invested so you can choose to check it out
foodpanda <malay>dah takde agaknya asal nak</malay>

[oh] I was watching wentworth
it's about it's a women's prison show yes but it's [ah] creepier and more real it's (um) it's not is not a comedy like orange orange [kan] orange is more to comedy drama this one is quite violent [ah] ya no it's aussie
nine I know
yes got alot of show I'm waiting for (uh) (uh) why you like
[oh] (um) I mean for me (err) I'm waiting for money heist (uh) wentworth ozark dead to me kingdom so those are coming up with new seasons [ah]
ya [ah] ya you know right they going to do a korean remake on money heist
ya (uh) my friends are all waiting for it because they all enjoy korean show (uh) I don't really like remakes though
you watch korean shows
okay so you like money heist is it your favourite
why
[oh] ya
(mm)
ya ya
[oh] so you think you like a professional critic [ah]
ya ya ya I think it would be more stupid and unrealistic if let's say there's there were no idiotic actions I think a whole lot of the idiot idiot decisions you are talking about (uh) about the the gang right and the professor being overconfident (uh) #raquel# losing her shit because of a crush on the profeesor and so on but I think you just make it more real [lah] if not if not it's like a show that nothing goes wrong I don't like the second season (uh) but it was very entertaining to me [ah] also quite compelling and way better in spanish (um) ya
so but breaking bad is also a show where who brisk and also the overconfidence drive much of what the characters do except
(uh) (uh) the other character is a perfect hero and what he does for most of the story like walter white makes no mistake and then horribly effect or matter to him so damaging to everyone else at what he does I enjoy the professor in this (uh) money heist because he seems like a brilliant dude who makes no mistakes but some of it are impulsive decision and when various things went wrong sometimes really really wrong because of his actions
ya so I guess we can have different opinions [ah] but it's not bad but maybe you are right it's a bit too overrated [lah] anyway so today is twelve twelve (uh) sale so are you buying anything
I think for the next forty five minutes still have but I think it's going to extend until the next full (uh) a couple of days normally it's like that
usually
(mm) I think maybe you can try shopee first and then after that you can take a look at (uh) ASOS or maybe sports they got a lot of (uh) sneakers on sale

no I'm busy (mm) I'd or not I don't as of now I don't have any plans to buy her anything quite busy finding [ah] strider balance bike for #azam#
second
(uh) carousell so I found one (uh) (uh) that can deal at #buangkok# but (uh) he didn't reply so I'm still searching for it
[oh] okay [lah] why not it's a balanced bike not a bicycle so should be okay [lah] firsthand is hundred eighty because of the brand (uh) second hand if in luck we can get fifty dollars
you know
ya I need to get properly the other time when I check they sell forty dollars but (uh) the tire had cannot see the thread and then it's rusty so I need to check properly [lah]
it depends on his father's (uh) interests and free time
ya so have you thought about #azri's# suggestion about you continuing studies to get a degree
(uh) if you ask me I think so because diploma is pretty much nothing now it's more important to get a degree so I think if you land a job in (uh) government sector uniform group like (uh) prison service (uh) (um) I think there will be scholarship that you can apply to study part time degree
ya they're quite supportive [eh] but you need to read more [lah] you need to do more research (uh) but there's bond [lah] I think (err) since I think they going to pay for your study so confirm got bond
but then
you mean like this (uh) uniform group then you should (uh) still think of enrolling yourself for a part time degree by yourself [ah] that means you should set up save up because I think this is a good investment for yourself
(uh) I think you will thank yourself in future
ya okay
ya (mm)
doesn't
do you know a lot of people who has a degree
[oh] so like you you mentioned just now so they they basically
(uh) their degree are sponsored by the company [ah] ya I mean like for example (um)
(mm)
so rolls royce pay for his degree
[oh] that's good so (uh) as he get as he [ah] got the degree right so did his salary also (uh) goes up went up
[oh] okay that's good can I ask what is his position
[oh] okay five years [eh] (mm) so how come you don't asked to apply there to get his (uh) recommendation do you don't you want to work there
[oh] okay okay
(mm) interesting rolls royce okay
[oh] so so you already have a friend who's working for the prison service
the way beneficial for him [lah] you need to stress world
so does that mean he lived in that means that thing is called a workers' quarters right okay so !wah! when he joined what was his (uh) education (uh) certificate diploma so so he join (uh) it's a guy right so he he joined with a diploma so that means sergeant
so staff sergeant (uh) then he gets to stay there with his family
(mm) ya I think they stay in the quarters but they they can rent out their own house [lah] well that's good that's good so so he so he's (uh) he told you that he signed bond for five years with (uh)
five years okay so (uh) is he still a diploma holder already upgrade to degree [oh] okay I think (uh) singapore preserving also one of the company that will sponsor you I think they have this kind of scholarship right
ya
really

that's good
what was the brand again

[oh] it's not retail
well that's good so did your friend take the offer degree

[oh] that's good
if you have to stay until the company
(mm) that means (err) work and study [ah] ya ya that's good you should get this kind of company still looking ya

[ah] no no no I'm actually singaporean but last time I had (um) indonesian <malay>punya</malay> maid so sometimes ya
ya
(uh) ya ya ya so actually (um) like last time my maid <malay>selalu</malay> (um) talk to me in in <malay>bahasa</malay> indonesia <malay>macam</malay> I know how ya how to speak ya (hmm)
sorry
(um) actually it just <malay>baru baru</malay> start so <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>macam</malay> just had like briefing then (uh) so far haven't actually do the the translation yet ya
(hmm)
[oh] you you also quit your job ya
I see I see ya
(hmm)
ya I think <malay>macam</malay> health actually quite important [lah] (um) ya I <malay>rasa macam</malay> when looking for a job it's important to
look for something that actually you would really feel happy <malay>macam</malay> what's the what's the point what's the point <malay>kalau kau pergi kerja</malay> everyday then like very stress and this kind of things is very unhealthy [lah] for your good for your health and stuff like that
same [lah] <malay>sama sama</malay> ya is is I think <malay>macam</malay> it's quite common <malay>gitu</malay> to feel that way if like when you're unhappy at the job ya
(um)
<malay>dah berapa tahun dah berapa tahun</malay> in
you <malay>kerja</malay> [oh] so <malay>baru</malay> graduate also
[oh]
(hmm)
[oh]
<malay>dari dari</malay>
from which from which uni
[oh] sorry sorry from poly is it
okay okay
(hmm)
I see I see
[oh] drama side drama side <malay>macam buat apa</malay> like day to day like what is it like
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>macam</malay> entertainment <malay>untuk dia punya budak-budak</malay> that kind of thing [lah]
I see I see
(hmm)
okay okay
(hmm) so you're you're you're currently taking a break so your company <malay>macam</malay> allows you to to to to take breaks in between [lah]
(mm) <malay>dia</malay> (mm) okay I understand I see ya actually the way you feel is actually quite common [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> like some some of us <malay>yang baru</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> then like like we didn't had prior experience in or maybe we had internship but it was slightly different so we thought that <malay>macam</malay> when we graduate the work would be in certain way but actually is not so I guess it's actually like <malay>macam</malay> is it a mismatch of expectations <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>baru</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> you thought it would be something else
(hmm)
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm) actually good good that your boss <malay>macam</malay> I recognize that you you need to take a break then (um) then <malay>kalau</malay> when you're better than you can always <malay>balik</malay> go back to work he said you can go back right at least he welcomes you back then that's good ya ya so for me (uh) ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I work for <malay>dua tahun</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (uh) I tried <malay>dua</malay> company <malay>tapi macam</malay> (uh) at the same time it felt different <malay>tapi macam</malay> same like the problem was the same that I that I face at both companies so I also <malay>macam tak tahu</malay> if it's the industry <malay>punya</malay> issue or <malay>kalau</malay> I need to change industry <malay>atau</malay> change company ya <malay>macam</malay> that that problem was in my problem was in my head for a while so I decided to <malay>macam</malay> take a break and then (um) from there I explored different different <malay>punya</malay> industry and then (um) at the same time I <malay>kerja</malay> part time then (um) <malay>macam</malay> trying to at the same time I explore [lah] whether I feel <malay>nak</malay> stay in this industry or I want to go to something new that kind of thing it's tough [lah] one thing like when we graduate and then we don't know what we want to do forever kind of thing cause ya because your career is you like to decide right <malay>macam</malay> you want to stay here or move to something else like ya
ya
correct
(mm)
ya at least some more now <malay>macam</malay> it's COVID <malay>punya</malay> period then then <malay>nak nak cari kerja pun macam susah</malay> then ya so our options are limited right don't you think
(mm)
it's something better than <malay>macam</malay> nothing right
(mm)
ya ya ya I think to be honest <malay>macam</malay> singaporean man a bit cautious or like became <malay>fikir banyak sangat</malay> of what people think of us you know right we should just can just do whatever that feels good for you then <malay>kalau</malay> doesn't it doesn't feel good then I guess it's not good for your health also then you should just do something else I guess ya I'm start I'm starting to like accept that a career doesn't always go the way you want it to go and that's and that's that's okay because not everyone has a perfect career at the start also so <malay>macam</malay> just take it day by day try something new I guess if if if you want to try something new learn something new <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm I'm actually I'm studying something about digital marketing with so <malay>macam</malay> at every ya every <malay>setiap pagi</malay> I I have to attend the what is it called a webinar ya ya it's for <malay>macam tiga jam</malay> [jer] then (um) <malay>ada</malay> assignment then (um) some project ya just learning new things I guess
[oh] the the webinar is actually (uh) era diploma like a full blown diploma so it's <malay>enam enam bulan</malay> then ya at the same time they are <malay>macam</malay> giving allowance for it so I guess that's good ya <malay>tapi</malay> those (hmm) <malay>tu</malay> actually <malay>untuk</malay> mid career adults [lah] <malay>macam</malay> those that <malay>ada</malay> work experience but you want to try something new so I just just took this opportunity to learn something new [lah] I guess ya
ya
(hmm)
<malay>tak payah</malay> because everyday <malay>macam</malay> is just online so we just attend it whenever you want to wherever you are also can on mobile
(hmm)
ya
but how <malay>macam mana nak</malay> teach the kids if it's working at home I don't understand
[oh] okay okay
(hmm) okay I see I see I see <malay>sebab dia</malay> what do you feel about on on that that kind of arrangement
(hmm)
okay
[oh]
(hmm)
[oh] that's (hmm)
ya <malay>macam</malay> overload of things to to do right do you feel
<malay>tapi</malay> what about the your your other work <malay>punya</malay> colleagues like do they feel the same way
(hmm)
(hmm)
ya
(hmm)
(hmm)
I see I see
I see
that's true
(hmm) sounds very challenging [lah] <malay>macam susah</malay> so
ya so <malay>macam</malay> I told you I took a break from I I totally left my industry at the moment [lah] so I started taking (um) (um) I started joining this financial advisory <malay>punya</malay> company then <malay>dia orang</malay> give like trainings (um) to to prepare us [lah] <malay>macam</malay> how to how to like you know prospect for clients <malay>macam</malay> how to (um) basically like sell their their products that kind of thing ya so at because I <malay>rasa</malay> sales <malay>punya</malay> skill is quite important <malay>macam</malay> in every industry you go is quite important to be able to sell your ideas or <malay>kalau</malay> be it ideas or products to anybody [lah] so so I <malay>rasa macam</malay> it's a good opportunity for for me to learn new skills like sales is not easy right this is what I learn <malay>macam susah</malay> to <malay>macam</malay> convince people (um) to actually buy into your idea or buy into whatever it is you are selling ya so it's it's a process [lah] I'm I'm still it's it's been about three months ya so thing ya
(hmm) I <malay>macam baru</malay> start meeting clients that (um) (uh) there are some (um) potential potentially potentially that potential clients sorry ya so that one ya will have to follow up on that [ah] ya
so (um) other than that <malay>macam</malay> I think you what you said about (um) an environment a good environment is quite important to be in a good environment and supportive (um) like make you <malay>macam</malay> want to go to work everyday that kind of thing you know ya so so far so good I guess <malay>tapi macam</malay> I haven't actually (um) had a successful sale but hopefully soon ya ya
then thank you then (um) for the ya for the part time work ya I just started because I wanted to <malay>macam</malay> earn extra income ya ya so it's in a sense <malay>macam</malay> or even though <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm like not earning as much as last time I feel like more happy <malay>macam</malay> ya like I don't <malay>bangun tak rasa macam</malay> stress or in like angry you know that kind of thing ya like then you go then after work <malay>macam</malay> you don't feel so fed up like you don't feel like not talking to anybody this <malay>macam</malay> how I felt [lah] everyday after after work last time like you <malay>balik rumah macam tak ada</malay> mood to talk ya you just want to like bathe and sleep ya ya
[oh] man ya that feels like me
ya I think it's common like <malay>macam</malay> I spoke to my <malay>kawan</malay> my friends <malay>dia orang pun macam rasa</malay> the same the same thing [lah] ya but those for those that are not happy with their work ya so
(hmm) yes yes yes
(mm)
(mm)
then you got try <malay>macam</malay> try company company <malay>lain tak</malay> like because <malay>ini</malay> your first job [kan]
so you did you like try to apply for different companies see whether <malay>macam</malay> is different environment that could maybe make you feel differently about the work itself
(hmm)
[oh] okay okay okay
but you said you did the conversion
(mmhmm)
I see I see so this is like the conversion thing you're talking about [lah] [oh] okay
(mm)
ya
(hmm)
is it you are supporting financially <malay>ke</malay> or <malay>dia boleh</malay> pay for <malay>dia punya</malay> own things like [oh] is it difficult
(mm)
I see I see okay then I will just I will just talk about myself ya ya ya okay (um) so (um) ya it's really <malay>macam</malay> it's I think <malay>sekarang</malay> we're in a very difficult <malay>punya</malay> position <malay>pasal</malay> there are many things that we are expected to be able to achieve by now so actually I'm twenty I'm twenty six years old how about you
[oh] you are twenty only [oh] sorry sorry I'm twenty five not twenty six ya so like and ya at at at the same time my my <malay>mak</malay> and my my dad don't pressure me [lah] like because ya even though I'm already twenty five <malay>tapi dia orang macam</malay> they know it's not easy [lah] our time to like they said last last time by twenty five <malay>dia orang dah kahwin dah ada anak</malay> you know that kind of thing but they but they don't <malay>macam</malay> push that idea on to me that you know that kind of pressure so I think [ah] <malay>macam syukur</malay> [lah] like I feel quite
not stressed at home which is great [lah] because some people feel stressed at work and at home you know that another thing ya so I'm thankful for that ya I'm thankful for that at least ya
[oh] I know what that means ya
[eh] same same ya
same same
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
[oh]
(mm) I see ya I think <malay>macam</malay> same my family <malay>macam</malay> not very affectionate also when growing up what <malay>macam</malay> don't we don't really communicate face to face with so much
ya I think it's common more common that you think but like at the same time it's not that great not something to be proud of ya ya
(mm)
you <malay>ada</malay> connections with like theatre <malay>punya</malay> (um) like people in the theatre industry do you have connections
no time is it like no (hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya I know what you mean actually I'm also seeing someone then I also feel a bit down like but even though even though like I don't really talk about it like ya I do worry about like what what I'm whether I'm doing enough at the moment kind of thing ya so I think is understandable what you feel I've totally get it ya
ya I get it
(mm)
(um) actually <malay>macam</malay> I just told him I am exploring something new [lah] while because like at the same time also (um) learning like <malay>macam tengah belajar</malay> new things ya while I take advantage of the trainee trainee not really trainee right it's like a course by united so <malay>macam</malay> I'm just taking a break it's been about two three months plus ya about almost almost four months
(um)
then I feel I mean because I I don't depend on him for anything [lah] like I can pay for my own things like I <malay>ada</malay> savings and that kind of thing so I mean he is he's okay with that [lah] like he kind of like supportive I guess ya
but I guess like <malay>ada ada</malay> like I guess like it's normal to feel not good enough when you're not sure also ya
(mm) ya
[oh]
ya
ya I think <malay>macam</malay> having colleagues they are so helpful is so great for for any workplace [lah] it's it's quite important to have a supportive your colleagues that you can talk to laugh with that kind of thing <malay>macam</malay> it you make you look forward to <malay>nak pergi kerja</malay> you look forward to seeing them
[oh] [oh]
okay
[oh] okay
[oh]
ya #irritatingnya#
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm)
(hmm)
then <malay>dia orang dia orang tak bayar</malay> (hmm)
[oh] that sucks
(hmm) [oh] you mean the your conversion is is a proper diploma or what like <malay>macam mana</malay> like how does it work
(hmm)
(hmm)

(hmm) so little
[oh] so october is now
so what do you think <malay>macam</malay> you want to try <malay>ke</malay> you don't want <malay>ke</malay>
at the same time (um) I <malay>rasa</malay> like while we're still young important to save also [lah] saving is quite important ya ya so <malay>macam</malay> since since I was young [kan] I always believe in saving then <malay>macam</malay> I am quite thrifty [lah] <malay>macam</malay> and like <malay>macam tak</malay> spendthrift <malay>sangat</malay> so like I made sure to to have enough savings [lah] so that on a rainy day I won't feel the pain so hard ya
ya
(hmm) ya
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
[oh] but
(hmm) [oh] I thought I thought [oh] okay

[oh] ya ya that's why you already started already
[oh] but now is the intake right you said october you just check <malay>macam</malay> apply for fun [lah] like what's what's it there's nothing to lose <malay>kalau</malay> you apply if anything there's a there's something to gain right (hmm)
[oh] okay okay okay
ya <malay>tapi</malay> you can just tell her later [kan] like <malay>macam</malay> that you you're but you're officially left right you said
[oh]
<malay>tapi ada</malay> notice period <malay>tu semua</malay> [lah]
[oh] <malay>kenapa</malay>
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
then <malay>kalau kalau</malay> you leave you must <malay>bayar dia punya</malay> six thousand <malay>ke tak</malay> like it like if you do finally decide
[oh] that's good
<malay>tapi macam</malay> you don't owe companies anything you know sometimes like if you want to leave you can just leave then <malay>kalau tak</malay> then we'll go back that kind of thing that you don't have to be trapped feel trapped ya
(hmm)
[oh] so sorry
[oh]
I totally get it get it ya
okay actually I <malay>ada kawan yang</malay> just started the early childhood she also was from engineering <malay>punya</malay> field then I think she did the conversion but I don't know whether is it's the same conversion as you
ya so <malay>kalau</malay> you want you want me to connect you with her I can give you her number that you can talk to her then like find out more about <malay>dia punya</malay> program how it when cause I think she's been there for she's been there for about three months or something few four months
ya
can later I will give you her number ya then (um)
no worries then then from there maybe you can like decide whether you want to continue or not cause she switch industry totally so <malay>dia</malay> totally no background in early childhood whatsoever but she wanted to try and she she I think she's okay I'm meeting her next week so hopefully she's okay you can find out from her I will tell her that that that I have a friend who wants to find out more early childhood then can ya then I think it's important to talk to people <malay>macam</malay> sometimes you feel shy right I am also a shy person so I don't really like asking I don't really asking people for opinions or held that kind of thing it's not <malay>macam</malay> out of arrogance is just like personality
so ya <malay>macam</malay> some ya ya ya that feeling what's <malay>segan</malay> to us just sometimes that feel that way <malay>tapi</malay> actually it's quite important it's quite important to to to talk to people who already have experience <malay>macam</malay> whatever you have experience [lah] then you can maybe hopefully get encouragement or like inspiration from this this kind of people ya
then can maybe made you look forward to something better and maybe she can even recommend you to her company you know you never know
ya I would link you I would link you I would link you up later then at least <malay>macam</malay> [lah] like like after you talk to her then if you realise okay I really don't wanna do early early childhood then you can start looking at other industry [lah] then at least you roll one out
ya
yup I'll text her later I'll text her later than I'll give you her number she's a very nice person ya
can you hear me can you hear me
[oh] I hope our recording is not affected recording is not wifi [kan]
(hmm) ya
[oh] I
okay okay
(hmm) ya
(hmm)
[oh]
okay okay
ya
ya ya she's very nice she's very nice ya
so actually I met her from (um) like a random <malay>punya</malay> part time job also then <malay>macam</malay> we got close ya after like a few few weeks ya so then we kept in touch and <malay>macam</malay> after how many years still keeping in touch which is like as if like we know each other so long ya
so ya <malay>macam</malay> random it's like a random near two two weeks or three weeks job then after that we still keep in touch so it's quite nice ya
ya okay so maybe hopefully after that it will help you [lah] I just wanted to like try help you a little bit but don't know whether it will help ya
ya
no worries okay
I don't know I think <malay>macam</malay> I'm I I I before I do things I put a lot of <malay>macam</malay> thought into it it's not <malay>macam</malay> a fleeting decision like I was really <malay>macam</malay> very stressed out at my previous workplace then I was like okay I had enough nowadays I need I need a real break like even even my <malay>punya</malay> bosses all like understand [lah] like my work was difficult [lah] like I was facing a difficult <malay>punya</malay> client <malay>macam</malay> everyday <malay>hentam</malay> on email kind of thing so it was very stressful ya
so
at the same time <malay>macam</malay> as in like I said [lah] because I had <malay>macam</malay> savings to to tide me over a few months of not working so that that's that's important [lah] like like what I'm telling you cause like you're younger right
ya so like
(hmm) important to save [ah]
so that I know like if you do need to take a break you can afford it you know that kind of thing like I know not everyone can afford not everyone can afford to do what I'm doing [lah] ya it's not it's not easy to like especially imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> children or what you know not they they cannot definitely cannot do what I'm doing [lah] like take a break and not work kind of thing
(hmm) so
(hmm)
(hmm)
good for you [lah]
sure
(hmm)
[oh] no
(hmm)
why
[oh] probation [ah] <malay>macam sekarang sekarang</malay> is probation period is it
<malay>tapi dia punya</malay> contract what the contract say
then you actually you can demand for that you know
(uh)
no but your contract said you have so actually <malay>macam</malay> you have like a right to keep fight for it ya and then <malay>dia orang tak</malay> they didn't write anything about probation right in the contract then actually you can ya if I were you I would have fought
(hmm)
you mean [oh]
that sucks though
(hmm) ya that ya

they even even
ya
ya
ya ya I I nearly had that with sarah with the whole #bali# thing with the whole #tini# and the #bali# thing and all that cause I I <malay>macam</malay>
at that point of time I was I I understood I understood why sarah
got pissed off about what happened you know what happened right sort of
ish
ya
#tini#
no to #tini# to #tini# so
no so it's not that (um)
meeting #tini# was just like a coincidence thing cause she <malay>dia dia kerja dekat</malay> the hostel <malay>kat mana ni</malay> clarke quay then I was working <malay>kat lima</malay> [pe]
on that day
so I I know that #tini# has been like a bit emoish on her facebook and what not so I'm like [eh] babe come [ah] <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] like
[ah] <malay>apa ni aku habis kerja pukul lima</malay> like we can just like hang out [eh] no that time <malay>habis kerja siang</malay> two or three so we just smoke like by the side of like #haji# lane and then she just goes on and on about what had happened in #bali# when me and #azmi# left so when me and #azmi# was there and we asked her face to face even
jas was there with us <malay>tak ada apa-apa</malay> [lah] no [lah] nothing <malay>dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas</malay> that kind of thing so we went back to singapore cause like sarah was heads head over heels like <malay>macam</malay> [orh] this jas guy is nice <malay>memang</malay> he he he is a very <malay>lepak</malay> guy to hang out and all that and then we told her babe
I think he's just being a gentleman I think he really got nothing with #tini# cause we asked #tini# face to face so all these while when #tini# like when we when me and her hung out [ah] like she like [oh] <malay>dekat</malay> #bali# this happened and then he give me all these
and I was like fuck like
this is not
at the same time yes
correct so so so
<malay>tini macam</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>dia cakap gini dia cakap gini pasal</malay> sarah and it was just lies cause I know what is happening on sarah side as well
this fucking <malay>dia dia lupa</malay> [pe] [sial] <malay>kita</malay> like in a group ya correct then (um) like she just keeps on talking and talking and talking like all the way until back to my house I was just I I I I swear to god I just <malay>diam</malay> I just cause she she
[ah] she was just basically <malay>macam</malay> member [lah] [eh] jas <malay>gini gini gini</malay> I don't know I have [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you know commitment issues #tini# like of course [lah] [kan] <malay>dia dengan dia punya</malay> commitment issue blah blah blah and then you know [ah] this happen and then she's like [oh] jas told me <malay>dia pergi lepak dengan kawan dia</malay> after the tipsy cow and I knew that was not was happening cause I knew that jas went back with sarah !hey! cause <malay>dia lupa</malay> [sia] correct then I
when I hear all these things from #tini# I'm like bullshit bullshit [sial] [lah] <malay>dia ni puki betul budak</malay>
so at some point no we hung out <malay>kita lepak dari pukul dua tiga</malay>
<malay>sabar sabar sabar sabar</malay> so
at at some point #tini# said this sentence (um) jas <malay>cakap dengan aku</malay> (um) <malay>macam</malay> (uh) I never felt like this for a girl before <malay>dia cakap gitu</malay> that that didn't happen just last weekend like at tipsy cow right
like he said a different thing so I couldn't and I just babe okay I can't take it anymore I told #tini#
this is what's happening with him and sarah and then #tini# just went full on bitch mode and that was what happened that night he wanted to follow she wanted to talk to sarah <malay>hari tu juga dia nak berbual dengan</malay> sarah babe
pizza
so sarah
<malay>tak</malay>
no she and I and I told #tini# #tini#
I don't think it's okay for you to come not like this we don't talk to sarah now cause it's just not gonna happen like we are gonna go out <malay>tak apa tak apa tak apa boleh berbual</malay> [lah] <malay>dia cakap gitu</malay> then at at some point I told sarah sarah
(um) this #tini# and then sarah went ballistic already [ah] cause you know she she on her side she knew what happened already also somehow I can't remember
no no she don't know no
cause what me and #azmi# told her was that actually jas and <malay>tini tak ada apa-apa</malay> but when we were there <malay>memang</malay> they really like
they they told me to they told to our face [eh] <malay>tak ada apa-apa dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas</malay>
ya jas <malay>dengan tini</malay> and then when we left back when me and #azmi# left first then they stay in #bali# apparently something happened and jas is just telling bullshit to her [lah]
[ah] so <malay>dia masih dia dia fikir dia</malay> casanova this guy <malay>sana</malay> like that so (um)
she just went her <malay>minah</malay> [lah] she did became the <malay>minah</malay>
(err) <malay>dia salahkan</malay> jas but she wanted to like talk to sarah and like what the fuck is going on like that ya so [ah] ya then then that night happened and
no #tini# didn't want to talk [what]
it was very awkward
that's the thing I don't know I think when we came down I don't know maybe cause [oh] maybe cause in the taxi I told her babe actually right no one wants you there I say like it's it's really not a good time cause we want to hang out five of us
ya then I'm like <malay>kau nak pergi berbual dengan</malay> sarah <malay>buat apa kau pergilah berbual dengan</malay> jas I say like that <malay>dia yang buat</malay> problem [pe] like I was so angry
ya and then that was another awkwardness so sarah got pissed at me cause she thought I was badmouthing about her to #tini# which was not the case at all so when I had a one on one talk with (err) sarah I think like one or two weeks later it was just me and her at and <malay>dekat rumah dia dekat yang</malay> #percil# <malay>tu</malay> [ah] we we <malay>lepak</malay> we hung out
(um) and I told her like I feel like this is something that we should talk about so sarah made it clear that she felt like it wasn't in my place to [ah] she she said that
[ah] I am what was the word she used (um) <malay>macam berbual belakang dia</malay> [ah] like talking about her like that then I said no that was not the case this was what happened and my intention was not to stir up shit or talk about you behind her back and she felt like that cause before that there was the whole (um)
(err) bash thing
about what happened with them yes so these two things she thought like <malay>aku</malay> rattle mouth but the first one also then I said I understand what you're feeling about like the bash but really my intention at that point of time
you can you you can ask #azmi# you can ask #nisa# or whoever was there at your birthday [lah] that was your birthday right my intention was really [eh] sarah this this happened to sarah okay <malay>sekarang</malay> like how like what we gonna do about this like how can we help her
you know it was real but for her I overstep the line the fact that she told me and #azmi# in confident and I go out <malay>macam</malay> to her <malay>aku</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> #lan jiao wei# <malay>pasal dia</malay> babe I I told and I look at her in the eyes
I I I don't think I have a single bone in me to do that to a friend and I'm not like that I am not rattle rattle no it's just at that point of time this was but I understand where you're coming from it could have been in better circumstances maybe you could [ah] tell it to us first before you know but at that point of time
I just wanted to help you and she said she didn't she didn't need help I'm like okay so from the conversation [ah] what I <malay>macam</malay> [ah] what I [ah] take from it is that [ah] sarah and sarah is <malay>dia</malay> always <malay>takut</malay> (err) she put put this image of herself that's not nice I feel [lah] this is just my personal
(um) <malay>macam</malay> (um) how to say [eh] <malay>macam</malay> (um)
no no no like <malay>macam dia jaga</malay> conduct
like like her way her her image is <malay>dia nak kena jaga</malay> conduct she don't like people talking about her cause I don't know maybe she has her own demons or anxiety and all that right so she correct no one [ah] [ah] I totally understand like I'm her friend babe I fucking love her you know like I will not do that and I
so I I I I I went back home and not <malay>nangis</malay> to #azmi# but <malay>macam</malay> I felt so I felt guilty of course that she felt like that right how can I not babe you know but then at the same time I told #azmi# that I I I I know this is my <malay>niat</malay> but sometimes <malay>kadang-kadang niat baik</malay> but (um) you know it it just people will not understand or to to that someone it's how they see it
I cannot force them to mould them and change how they think about me right correct correct so from like
from then onwards I I <malay>macam</malay> I [ah] back off sort a little bit to really
talk about the the our depths of you know what we feel with with
that she both are being played so jas is just a fucking asshole just it
yes and even sarah ya ya correct
ya ya correct cause correct #tini# told me ya sorry #tini# #tini# told me that (um) <malay>macam</malay> I've I don't open up to guys [one] like I've had this issues for years correct and when she she that's why she <malay>senyap</malay> this is the reason why she's being very quiet so this this all adds on to it and
(um) like I I get where she's coming from as well but then like that day she didn't turn up for the the birthday thing the the the #laksa# thing we were having I was pissed off [lah] I feel like <malay>macam</malay> you put it out there like people are get you trying to get to you <malay>macam nak buat</malay> [sial] <malay>kat kau</malay> you know but
ya you you actually have a group of people who genuinely cares for you who will tell you as it is who will not
fuck you up who would not do shit behind your back who still [eh] <malay>jom</malay> [ah] <malay>lepak</malay> even though for months you been [eh] come [ah] we pick for you freaking put her name on a cake babe no no thank you no sorry no what sort like
#nisa# did #nisa# did
[eh] #nisa# did and then I I put also [eh] #tini# we miss you [ah] we miss you then cut the cake for you I said that [what]
ya so that that was the whole thing and I I I don't babe I don't
<malay>kau cakap dengan aku pasal</malay> something I don't go to <malay>ni</malay>
I I will never do things like that
[ah] no I will never I I I will not it it is never my my <malay>macam</malay> (um) my intentions to [ah]
hurt
we and it for us like sometimes [oh] we talk about <malay>tini macam gini</malay>
but gossip is <malay>kau tahu dia ni</malay>
ya
ya right ya
so ya [lah]
then that that was what happened so hope that ya that that exactly we don't I don't come to you and like only only now one year later then we like you know
but ya so that that thing with sarah I felt that there was a little bit of a shift
(um) in our <malay>macam</malay> friendship in the sense that for her to me is the trust which I for me <malay>macam</malay>
I cannot just force someone to like trust or ya ya no she trusts me she trusts me is just in terms of
[ah] <malay>hati dia</malay> like she wants to <malay>jaga</malay> her feelings blah blah blah so I which I I
ya which I I which I respect really I I cannot force her to
[eh] <malay>bilang aku bilang aku</malay> you know
ya
ya actually normal
ya that's true
ya
of course
ya
ya
you know you talk about all these cliche romantic things like till till death do us part in sickness and in health and all this bullshit it's not bullshit really like it's not it just doesn't apply to a marriage or a boyfriend girlfriend and like
friends if you don't fight then something is not right that means you're just saying things to the other person you know you need to <malay>gaduh</malay> ya and any relationship will have that <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> [ah] [ah] <malay>apa</malay> (err) what what's that word [ah] friction exactly right and then it's how you talk about how it is after that how that person react
you know like how you you you take it you know whether you you make it big or things like that but I feel like is is is it's it's inevitable to <malay>gaduh</malay> in any relationship
ya it's not like there's no point of time where <malay>apa aku cakap</malay> too much then you don't tell me there are times like that vice versa you know it's like
even even with #nisa# sometimes you know like [ah] I'm not comfortable [ah] talking about it like good then I'm like great #nisa# thank you like no I respect that
ya
it's an asian thing also [ah]
[kan] <malay>pasal semua kena nak cakap kena beralas</malay> [ah] <malay>nak cakap nak kena</malay>
<malay>dua tiga kucing berlari</malay>
ya wait I
ya I think we need to learn more to just be unapologetically have boundaries
you know like no [lah] ya

I know I use to find it so hilarious
<malay>muka kau kasih kicap</malay> [eh]
<malay>lu mana punya lu mana punya kampung</malay>
<malay>terus macam kau</malay> I remembered the first
time someone used that word <malay>kampung</malay>
and like this I remember this guy I don't know how I I found him where I found him
but (err) we we wrote letters to each other right cause <malay>dulu tak ada tak ada</malay> social media
this was like secondary school and (um) he gave me his phone numbers and then we talk on the phone so we've been talking on the phone
and then suddenly some girl
(err)
apparently that he was dating was not happy that I was talking to him
and he [oh] my god we so #minahrep# babe and she talk to me on the phone one time she answered the phone call and talk to me and she was like
(err) like
you know <malay>asal kau berbual dengan dia ni</malay> [ah]
then I'm like [ah] <malay>kita tulis surat</malay> [ah] then after that she's like <malay>tak ada sekarang kau kau dari mana punya kampung</malay>
<malay>gua mahu turun sekarang</malay> then
this stupid girl that I was like I'm like
<malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>kampung</malay>
then she like <malay>kau kampung pun tak tahu</malay> [sial] <malay>kau</malay> [ah] <malay>kampung dia cakap gitu</malay>
<malay>terus aku</malay> then I felt so uncool I put down the phone and then I go ask my <malay>kakak angkat</malay> what is <malay>kampung</malay> so apparently [ah] <malay>kampung</malay> is like [ah]
<malay>kau budak mana</malay> it's like where are you
[ah] which gang are you from or like which area are you from you from like that [lah] then I was like [oh] <malay>abeh kira kita ni kampung apa</malay> <malay>aku tanya kakak angkat aku</malay>
and then [ah] she like <malay>kita budak</malay> #marsiling# [ah] cause last time I stay with my with my auntie [ah] in in woodlands vista point area then <malay>budak kita budak</malay> #marsiling# [ah]
then in my head in this secondary one two <malay>tak nak</malay> [ah] #marsiling# <malay>tapi kita tinggal</malay> woodland <malay>jauh</malay> [seh] <malay>dengan</malay> #marsiling#
but #marsiling# got port there [what] #marsiling# is
they even until now is notorious man when I was working with real life stories right
cause the borders is just right beside that that rental flat
there is this yes so you can actually see the the sea
the border
that that ya that that there's a causeway so apparently (um) all these people taking drugs or trying to get in to singapore in and out illegally
it's there so if you if you like that time when I went to see one of my clients there [lah] (err)
I <malay>jalan</malay> and everyone that is that that like under the block and all that [kan] <malay>dia macam</malay> you can see from their face <malay>macam ni budak ni bukan dari sini</malay> so they will like try to see how you dress
got one guy go down <malay>tangga</malay> saw me
and then <malay>dia macam</malay> stop in the middle of <malay>tangga</malay> then I'm like (uh) <malay>turun</malay> [jer] [lah] [kan]
then she like he like look at me but I think he he suss me out okay okay this one like okay right then he like walk he walk also he like
trying to see what I'm doing there but then so that was the first time so the second time I I make sure to like I have some files in my hand and
so to make it look like a social work here like like a social worker I was there to do to do work to see all my clients right
so I'm like ya but like it's notorious then like my my boss like #salimah# [lah] I was saying that
every one or two days there'll be raids there will be ya it's not even like <malay>macam</malay> old airport road like the raids once a month kind of thing here it's like every few days there are raids cause it's the border thing [ah] ya so like that
ya #marsiling# <malay>punya</malay>
#marsiling# <malay>gua kicap sama lu budak</malay> #toa payoh#
<malay>kicap sama lu</malay>
that one <malay>cina cina</malay> [one] [ah] I think
do you want to find your your gang
you're the main girl gang like
but it was scared like not scary but you can just see that everyone there was like on their toes so when I went out of the lift to go to
my client's house like you can just see people sitting at the staircase ya and then I like when I go out they look at me <malay>macam</malay> cause
their their eyes is like <malay>apa kau buat kat sini</malay> so I always make sure the next time to like bring files and bring
(um) books
ya but you know who I put the group of volunteers to read to the boy there
boys from
yup I love it so it's actually four or five boys reading to one kid there so my boss was like good idea
cause these boys are like but they are so on babe they are so #siao# on let us
let us know what we can help how we can help so we go there we like ya this is how rented house in singapore looks like and they look to be honest
this group of boys <malay>tak ada</malay> judgment I I am surprised I think cause they are like
I I feel like my generation in the late twenties early thirties there are there's a judgemental state
cause we we came from normal phones to social media right but they they are in the heart they are the woke sort of people so they they are more they they their eyes is more of like <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] this is so interesting
ya
ya then they bring the boy down suddenly cause we we tell them like if they just want to read for ten minutes fifteen minutes that's good enough kids first like <malay>boleh duduk diam</malay> like what <malay>sepuluh minit lima belas minit</malay>
but after that if they want to go down they want to <malay>lepak</malay> so they bring this boy to the playground <malay>main</malay> catching babe
<malay>main</malay> catching <malay>dengan budak-budak kat</malay> playground <malay>main bola main apa</malay> then I'm like
!wah! these boys boys babe [eh] sorry sorry not my apologies #hwa chong# institution

they even suss out (um) not influencers but artist sort of from other schools <malay>macam</malay> not famous but like one one thousand two thousand followers

I wouldn't say early [lah] but it was just like one week before assessment so
I started off early then at first the all all my paintings look good at first then <malay>tiba-tiba aku</malay> just <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> keep telling myself that <malay>aku ada banyak masa</malay>
then end up like push push everything until <malay>macam</malay> friday which is the set up day ya then <malay>aku</malay> last minute rush <malay>abeh</malay> like
okay [lah] then I wasn't confident in myself
then my friend she she was like so invested in her
her work [lah] then
<malay>dia dia macam</malay> confident <malay>gila</malay> [lah] that then she she was proud of her work
then (uh) all this while she okay [lah] I can see her effort [ah] that she did she did put in a lot of effort <malay>tapi dia punya dia punya</malay>
(err) work is like abstract ya so not a lot of people do abstract actually
then <malay>dia berbual pasal hijab</malay>
(mm)
then I I like I genuinely thought she would get good grades [lah] <malay>tapi tadi</malay> time assessment <malay>dia kena buat rabak gila</malay> ya
because we have to leave for one day
leave it for one day ya
then (err) because (err) my work is painting paste <malay>dengan aku</malay> add four D element which is projector [lah] then (err) (mm) <malay>aku aku</malay> end up being the last because

ya then <malay>aku</malay> nervous <malay>gila</malay> [ah] because like everybody like already presented then you know how like if you go first you cannot be compared with anybody then your if you are the last they see everyone's one even the good ones the bad ones they see everything already ya
ya then turns out they they they really like my work ya <malay>tapi</malay> like <malay>aku aku</malay> like just <malay>macam</malay> like because I felt like I didn't really do well you know
but I don't know why the lecturers like

[orh] cause (uh)
cause like I (uh) cause you know our vice you know sabrina
ya ya then she was there then (um)
because I was the last one right then (um) she she was not because she had to pick up a call
so <malay>dia dia</malay> leave [lah] in the middle of the
the presentation then (err) (mm) cause my artwork <malay>aku berbual pasal</malay> family then I don't know if it's because it's a very sensitive topic that's why <malay>dia orang macam tak berbual sangat pasal aku punya</malay> but then but then again right I had another classmate who like

the <malay>kadi</malay> is you book the <malay>kadi</malay> from the website right okay so and then you don't actually contact them <malay>apa tu</malay>
directly [ah]
okay
okay
ya
<malay>takpe</malay> [lah] it's okay [ah]
it's okay <malay>tak payah banyak-banyak</malay> then ya
(hmm)
[oh] okay <malay>jadi kalau kadi tu macam</malay> stay further but you select that <malay>kadi</malay> because you prefer also okay [lah] [oh]
(mm) okay
okay I see
okay okay
okay
(mm)
<malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> I have to wait until the date I want available first right so I cannot do in advance right
[oh] I see that means <malay>kalau</malay> if six of june I still have to wait until sixth of june available then I go in and register
[oh]
[oh] I I I I <malay>takut</malay> what or not I <malay>takut</malay> go in [ah] then I click click click click right then suddenly right it submitted then my date right not available then if I need to amend [kan] then is charges <malay>takde</malay> [eh]
okay
there there there is any amendment (err) there's there's charges [ah] ya
okay
<malay>tapi</malay> on that day is your date available already [lah] on the
[oh] haven't
ya
[oh] okay okay
[oh] I see so <malay>kirakan</malay> before the date available
you go in you select the <malay>kadi</malay> so (err) I mean you play with the form <malay>tapi</malay> you don't submit
[oh]
[oh] I I was thinking of doing that <malay>tapi</malay> <malay>macam takut</malay> #tersubmit# then you amend changes
later have to pay the difference [ah] the the charges [ah] and then ya so but I was also curious [ah] I want to see the form right and what is this question required because because my date is a double date so will be very (err) sought much sought sought after [lah] so don't want to make the mistake [ah] then that time you book <malay>masa tu nya</malay> (err) it's a sunday
<malay>mesti</malay> popular [kan] but then (err)
(err) how fast [ah] did did did sold out as in do you like wait the the night when the the date became available or you just wait the next day you submit
[oh]
okay
[ah]
<malay>takut tak dapat</malay> [kan]
okay
(mm) okay cause I also have to settle quite a number of things [ah] cause for #dewi# side [kan]
<malay>dia punya</malay> cause the dad is <malay>bukan</malay> is a non-muslim <malay>jadi kena cari kadi kadi tak banyak cuma ada sepuluh ke</malay> I think <malay>sepuluh</malay> then
[oh] [oh]
[oh] I think about ten [ah] ya but <malay>dia ada lagi satu</malay> (err) <malay>punya susah</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> (um) <malay>dia nya kadi</malay> [kan] <malay>dia tak boleh apa tu</malay>
(err) <malay>kalau buat dekat</malay> (err) location <malay>lain</malay> [kan] <malay>dia nya kadi</malay> cannot be <malay>yang</malay> full time staff
so full time staff <malay>sana ada</malay> about <malay>tiga orang</malay> so out of the ten
I only can pick seven then from that seven I think got two or two not fluent in english [ah] so my (err) number of <malay>kadi</malay> shrink shrink then <malay>entah abeh sekarang</malay> nowadays I cannot see the <malay>kadi</malay> reviews on the web [eh] <malay>dulu</malay> got or not I saw a lot of the video being recorded previously
but the the videos are removed ya so I like
so I also don't know but I know #salim jasman# I saw the video [lah] so I thought
he's okay he's fast I prefer <malay>pasal dia nya dia nya</malay> style is like
<malay>berbual sikit</malay> then go
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>ada satu</malay> (err) <malay>kadi tu dia</malay> quite quite
very eloquent [ah] <malay>tapi bila</malay> I <malay>tengok dia nya</malay> video [kan]
[ah] they they drag on
[ah]
ya ya (mm)
ya ya correct
(mm)
ya <malay>pasal sekarang</malay> I know <malay>yang satu kadi ni yang</malay> I identified this #salim jasman# I saw
<malay>cara dia buat macam betul</malay> relax [ah] (err) he just
(err)
I think he is not very particular as long as he can hear the person say and he just proceed
[oh] okay
okay
yup
ya
busy [ah]
okay
(mm) okay (mm) (mm)
okay okay
[oh] okay okay
[oh] the okay (uh huh)
<malay>tapi bagus</malay> [ah] because you <malay>tak ingat</malay> then that means also no stress [lah] <malay>bila baca baca</malay> [jer] [ah]
ya ya ya it sounds it sounds <malay>baku</malay> ya
ya [lah] ya [lah] <malay>tapi berbual macam berbual bahasa melayu pun kelakar juga</malay> ya
(hmm) okay I see then ya
<malay>tapi yang kadi tu</malay> is your family <malay>punya</malay> (err) acquaintance [ah]
[oh] <malay>tapi</malay> by then you don't know who that colleague is [lah]
(mm)
ya
okay (mm) okay <malay>jadi kirakan</malay> my plan <malay>sekarang</malay> is to go to the website fill up all the details then <malay>tapi bila dia punya</malay> date available submit straight (mm)
okay
okay
okay
[oh] <malay>tapi dia</malay> to submit is there's a submit button right as long you don't submit it won't go through [kan] okay
okay
okay same ya
(mm) okay same here okay <malay>jadi kalau</malay> time slot <malay>dia</malay> is (err) <malay>macam mana tu satu kadi</malay> can have more than one time slot [ah]
I mean based on your experience
[oh]
[oh] then ten to twelve will be very (err) quite hot [ah]
ya usually that time is the hottest [ah]
ya
[oh] [oh] okay
convenient [lah] (mm)
okay okay so I now I have a plan already so I can start to fill up the form
okay and then the charges <malay>untuk</malay> (err) this registration <malay>ada tak</malay>
[oh]
okay okay
<malay>tapi</malay> the marriage prep course <malay>tak payah</malay> [kan]
okay
<malay>tapi yang yang dia tanya tu</malay> is <malay>masa jumpa kadi</malay>
okay
[oh] okay I didn't know that
okay <malay>yang dia</malay> interview <malay>tu</malay> is

[oh] muslim [meh]
I think so
[oh] ya ya ya okay okay can [ah] I think I bring the parents [ah] okay [oh] okay okay that is the first step [ah]
okay (mm)
okay so so <malay>sebelum</malay> interview <malay>dengan kadi</malay> is you <malay>jumpa</malay> the head of the first
[oh] so <malay>jadi yang dekat</malay> <malay>tu jumpa dia punya</malay> <malay>punya</malay>
[oh] and <malay>tu masa</malay> during that time will be the time <malay>dia minta</malay> to any prep marriage prep course or he ask you to go [ah] [oh] that's after [oh]
(mm) okay okay
(mm) okay
[oh] okay
okay <malay>berapa</malay> [eh]
<malay>tiga ratus lebih</malay> [kan] I think <malay>dengar-dengar macam tiga ratus lebih</malay>
okay
okay [oh] <malay>dia masa tahun bila baru dia cakap tak</malay> compulsory [eh]
!huh! <malay>ye ke</malay> [oh] okay
all the time I heard is compulsory
until recently
ya
<malay>harus</malay> [ah]
okay
yes
<malay>betul juga</malay> !wah! <malay>tapi masa tu tak ada</malay> wedding cake
[oh] okay okay okay
I also want to reduce also
[ah] ya [lah]
<malay>pasal dia</malay> single single layer [kan]
<malay>pun tak dapat rasa</malay>
okay I see
[oh] okay okay okay
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>ye</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi yang</malay> cake <malay>ni</malay> is is actually not a muslim right is west western culture ya okay
okay
<malay>sekarang</malay> nowadays they offer <malay>macam</malay> hotel one they offer dummy cake just to for the photo taking
(mm) okay
okay
[oh] <malay>yang jaga</malay> makeup okay
(mm) (mm) nowadays got <malay>pak andam</malay>
(mm) <malay>pasal nak ikat dia punya bunga</malay> [eh]
<malay>tapi sekali</malay> [jer] [kan] maybe before the <malay>dia nikah</malay> [jer] [kan]
[oh] okay
(mm) ya
<malay>tapi mak andam sampai</malay> the whole day [mah]
so no no point right
okay okay
okay
ya
okay
ya okay
<malay>sama</malay> [lah]
bread and butter right
okay
(mm) okay
okay
okay
okay okay
okay
okay
!huh!
okay
okay
okay okay
(mm) okay [lah] angry [lah]
okay
<malay>cuma cuma dia punya masa tu</malay> thinking is <malay>dia nak pergi sana cepat</malay> so <malay>dia ada</malay> time to makeup [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
(mm) okay [oh] okay okay
for bride [lah] ya you <malay>dah</malay> plan [pe]
ya okay
okay
[oh] <malay>tu tak boleh jadi</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau orang dah bayar untuk tu semua mana boleh</malay> [seh]
!huh! [oh]
<malay>kirakan sekarang ni macam</malay> they are <malay>macam</malay> (err) they messed up the (err) planning
some some some <malay>mak andam</malay> because they because they want to do their part which is so they the the main thing is they make messed up the planning [lah] okay
okay
okay <malay>dia</malay> panic [lah] okay
okay
<malay>kirakan</malay> flexible [lah] okay okay (uh huh)
(mm) <malay>jadi kirakan kalau macam</malay> if we do <malay>nikah</malay> and wedding different place that's where the problem comes
ya okay
yes yes and traffic jam you don't know whether
okay
[oh] <malay>kirakan bukan pasal</malay> delay <malay>pasal</malay> they earn more [lah] no [lah] we we already paid them for that whole day so inclusive
<malay>tapi</malay> [oh] but you know how their charges are is like per whole [oh] not [oh]
but usually they won't try to delay unless really special occasion [ah] ya
okay
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay> #prata# okay
a bit greasy [ah]
<malay>sakit perut</malay>
[oh] most of your friend also do at fort canning [ah]
okay
I see
okay <malay>jadi mak andam</malay> is not requirement unless you have (err) several outfit change
[oh] okay okay <malay>jadi sama</malay> [lah] I think for my side I think I don't want to have <malay>mak andam</malay> I want to have like the makeup artiste is okay and also to see whether I have (err) ya
(mm) but but she have no experience
true also
okay
okay
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah] cause you want what you want [lah] okay
okay
I I even thought of what you know because <malay>dekat</malay> (err) <malay>katong sana</malay> [kan] there are many (err) salon ya then we thought (err) go there early ya
but that will be strange
(mm)
ya cause very close [eh] because <malay>yang</malay> grand mercure <malay>ada banyak</malay> salon ya how good [ah] that's why I have to go there okay
peranakan day [ah] so I think ya I have to go there early
ya <malay>dia pun</malay> I email <malay>juga</malay> (mm)
(mm)
okay so that part
ya I have to ask #dewi# to do research [lah] then from there
most likely we also will do the same thing [lah] <malay>kita tak akan ambil mak andam jadi</malay> [ah] the day <malay>macam</malay> one off <malay>saja</malay> [lah]
[oh] okay <malay>mak andam</malay> is for rental cause they got special rate
ya [lah] and another thing I was thinking whether should do photography after the wedding or that day
then the makeup will have to tip top after the wedding [mah]
okay
<malay>tapi</malay> of course photography on the same day is the best [lah] cheapest [ah] cheapest [lah] because you do makeup all that
[oh] okay so we do the <malay>nikah</malay> and the photography after that
okay I was thinking the peranakan house the terrace house over there and then east coast
(mm)
okay another thing I thought of so is inside the wedding the the hotel itself but must inform them right
cause (err) lynn told me don't know must sign agreement I don't know if you remember okay
okay now I cannot decide where to take photo because I haven't gone to the venue
<malay>paling senang dekat dalam</malay> hotel <malay>tu tak boleh gerak-gerak</malay>
(mm) okay
ya
(mm) ya <malay>dia nya</malay> swimming pool I ever went it looks nice [lah] so I think I need to ask the person on that day
whether to see okay
(mm) we can go up and see [ah]
(mm)
<malay>bila</malay>
really [ah] you mean you all what wedding day
you want to book the hotel [oh] we thought of booking hotel for you all so
!huh! is
okay
lucky you tell me [eh] cause we really thought of booking for you all also then dinner we can go eat ya okay
okay ya okay ya let us know [lah] because we thought of (err) booking [lah] ya
okay
okay then ya so
three three (err) I think for for your case [kan] <malay>tiga jam macam</malay> okay [ah] very manageable
ya it's is very fast I like that
<malay>apa yang</malay> teething problems
I I know one problem that you all face is the
the because of the shortage of space right the clearance of the the food I I saw is a problem <malay>aku</malay> outside [mah] but I can see people no space sit ya
(mm)
!huh! [oh] they stay back [oh]
(mm)
<malay>pasal panas</malay> [oh] ya [lah] <malay>hari tu memang panas jadi yang dekat</malay> (err) lawn <malay>tu</malay> mostly <malay>budak-budak</malay> parents <malay>semua tak pergi</malay> [seh] [ah]
yes yes I saw I saw it's quite (um)
ya I I I also saw a lot of people came to witness the <malay>nikah</malay>
[oh] okay
[oh] okay
for for my case okay [lah] <malay>terus</malay> settle
(um) but it's during the (err) the you you guys got the how is it how I can't remember the walk in [ah] how you guys did the walk
is straight away just sit on the okay
then after that all the way there and then
[oh] then after that then eat lunch then go back and sit again [ah]
cause for for (err) the place I have right there's a stage <malay>jadi kalau kirakan</malay> okay I was think I can rent for three hours three hours so I thought the <malay>nikah</malay> start at eleven thirty
then everything finished at twelve thirty
[eh] wait [ah]
I remember is a eleven to three [ah] ya
okay
[ah] I think it's four hours total ya ya
okay ya there will be there will be delay yes definitely
<malay>lagi-lagi kalau apa tu</malay> like what you said
<malay>betul juga tapi</malay> wedding <malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>orang macam</malay> panic [kan] <malay>jadi ada sikit</malay> problem <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>cuma apa tu</malay>
(err)
the itinerary so example eleven thirty my <malay>nikah</malay> so
<malay>nikah</malay> plus (err) tea ceremony ya
that is the main main core concept
[oh] I cannot say like I have to have at least sixty percent I must know what's happening
okay
ya [lah] <malay>siapa nak ikut</malay> to the letter [kan] yes
she don't care
yes
okay cause I thought the <malay>nikah</malay> and the tea ceremony will be done the first thing in the morning
[ah] that's the thing I need to go down and see the venue how it looks like whether ya
they will delay
<malay>kirakan</malay> I want to like <malay>macam</malay> eleven thirty to one for example is <malay>nikah</malay> tea ceremony and then
that's also the time <malay>kalau nak tukar baju pun boleh tukar</malay> [lah]
then one thirty
lunch time
so one thirty to about (err) one thirty two thirty three thirty ya about one thirty to three thirty [ah] then whole lunch [ah] then in between before the one thirty starts right (err) we have the walk in [lah] then from the walking then that means about one forty five blah blah blah some some
some plans [lah] some activity [lah] so for about ya
okay <malay>tapi kalau</malay> COVID <malay>dia ada</malay> different kind of rules [ah] only the twenty percent will be selected you can mingle
(err) out of that twenty they have to be in their table [oh] but <malay>mungkin</malay> maybe <malay>masa tu</malay> policy <malay>belum</malay> start [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> I went to the Grand Mercure right and (err)
#katong# and they mentioned the same thing twenty
close family can mingle
[ah]
<malay>tapi tapi kalau ada apa-apa nanti kena</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> COVID infection [ah]
okay
hopefully [lah] okay
okay I see but only worry like (err) <malay>yang</malay> table <malay>yang tak</malay> mingle boring [ah] <malay>duduk tengok</malay> each other <malay>makan</malay> cannot mix with the you know
so I thought of what you know get some emcee or what [ah] ya
okay
<malay>kalau</malay> [ah]
<malay>pasal</malay> your wedding <malay>lain</malay> [tau] your wedding can mingle is a is different cause (err) your time can be taken [ah] you know speaking [ah]
<malay>kena</malay>
simple simple (hmm) okay <malay>kalau</malay> [ah]
really [ah] actually I don't want to but because I don't want to make it boring for them and I want to have like unified (err) unified
okay
okay
<malay>kalau</malay> if I
(hmm) okay okay [oh] I <malay>itu yang</malay> category <malay>macam</malay> (err) emcee [ah] <malay>yang macam</malay> too much [lah] that's why
ya I want the like (err) formal one simple one
true also
I see
I <malay>kena fikir juga pasal ni</malay>
that is one thing then ya <malay>baju</malay> you all buy the fabric then make at the #joo chiat# right
okay
some more is if my date considered is during the <malay>syawal</malay> [tau] so have to do it early okay okay <malay>lagi apa lagi</malay> [eh]

we're still alive so might as well might as well find something to hold on <malay>cari kerja ke</malay> start business <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>kau nak buat</malay> business <malay>apa</malay> [sia]
<malay>apa</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya
I saw I saw your masks how was it
(mm)
but <malay>ada juga</malay> [ah] <malay>macam sikit</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh kau masih beli benda kat</malay> habbo
(mm) <malay>masih</malay> spend like hundreds of dollars on buying credits
[oh] how long already
when was the last time you bought
okay
but like you planning on staying or like once they move over to a new platform are you gonna like quit or like <malay>jual</malay> your <malay>benda</malay> and quit or
(mm)
<malay>banyak sangat benda</malay> [kan]
(mm)
not like what if it gets worst <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>dia orang</malay> remove <malay>banyak benda</malay> from the game then <malay>orang semua macam tak nak main</malay>
then what happens
true
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
but like
sad [sia] they had like this one opportunity to make it so much better with the new platform
and then they had to remove like the main aspect of the game
ya I guess but like I mean I guess it is a market (uh) like a money making game like they made it to earn money but then like
your players are like a main of the game [eh] without the players what do you have like an empty online page
(mm)
ya I mean it's not as if they are not making money you know they are making a lot
ya
I think <malay>dia orang macam tak fikir</malay> they gonna cause
<malay>macam</malay> like to them at the end of the day <malay>kita</malay> like we we like the game so much that like no matter what they do also we still continue buying we still continue playing
and that's what has been happening [what] like the
<malay>macam</malay> like some items they release and then they increase the price to like thirty five when previously was twenty five and then <malay>orang masih beli</malay> [pe] it's not they like everyone just okay no I'm not gonna buy anymore
so I guess that's why to them it's like no matter what they do we will still buy
[kan]
habbo
habbo is the main reason why yes
<malay>habis</malay> smite <malay>apa jadi</malay>
ya
[oh] really cause I know that day (uh) <malay>siapa naim</malay> asked (uh) #ilyas# to join but then #ilyas# said like the file was like twenty one he couldn't even download it anymore after he deleted everything from his laptop
but like kind of weird though like a game is so big that [lah]
(mm) four days ago three days ago ya <malay>macam</malay>
the file got too big for #ilyas# so like <malay>dia tak boleh</malay> download then <malay>sampai dia</malay> have to delete everything and try again couldn't
ya that's why [ah] <malay>ilyas dia cakap dengan aku</malay> like [oh] I cannot play with you cause <malay>sekarang dia main</malay> among us [jer]
ya
I think <malay>baru</malay> [ah] like three days maybe three days ago ya
I don't know but <malay>dia cakap dia</malay> delete <malay>semua benda tinggal yang</malay> programme files
like <malay>dia</malay> basically formatted his ya
ya that's why that's why I don't understand why is it so big I mean like doesn't make sense at all like smite is so big
<malay>dia cakap dulu</malay> file <malay>dia macam</malay> fourteen and then then after that it went up to sixteen <malay>lepas tu sekarang dah dua puluh satu</malay>
it's probably him ya
I don't know [sia]
cause that time <malay>dia cakap dia punya</malay> app <malay>ada</malay> issue [lah] he couldn't log in so <malay>dia</malay> delete then <malay>bila dia nak</malay> redownload <malay>balik tak boleh</malay>
so <malay>dia</malay> format like remove everything from <malay>dia punya</malay> <malay>lepas tu semua benda</malay> like he tried to download download download and then couldn't so he just give up
ya and he spent so much on that game also [what] I mean we all have
I guess
I heard they they were doing a spongebob
ya I heard I don't know someone said spongebob then I was like I don't know
[oh] ya that one I heard also but I heard I heard spongebob I want [sia]
I don't know
that'll be cool though can you imagine <malay>yang</malay> character character <malay>dia semua jadi</malay> spongebob <malay>punya</malay> character <malay>macam</malay> mister crab sandy
cute [sia]
(oo) is there a snail god
I don't know maybe
who could be that
#kumbhakarna#
yes
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(oo)
and another person [orh]
(hmm) that's hard good looks or fit body
probably go with good looks but I mean <malay>pasal kalau</malay>
<malay>badan sapau pun</malay> I mean you can just go to the gym <malay>boleh pergi</malay> gym <malay>boleh pergi</malay> like have a like a regimented like exercise routine for yourself and then you probably could get that <malay>tapi kalau nak muka baru</malay> I mean you can't really do that also [what] so probably good looks
(mm)
ya I guess <malay>banyak banyak duit</malay> at least about ten K for a nose or something I don't even know probably will be too much but like <malay>kalau nak</malay> like make yourself fitter and stuff <malay>boleh pergi lari</malay> and like exercise and stuff and then you're there it's fine so probably good looks
then yourself [leh]
(mm)
yes
ya
true
I mean to a certain extent <malay>semua orang pun macam</malay> at least a bit [ah]
true
(mm)
I mean also like after a certain point in your life like you can't really keep up
with like the fitness level and stuff I mean unless you're like one of those like super athlete and stuff [lah] <malay>kalau tak</malay> then there's really like no point
good looks
ya
(hmm)
after this I don't know never really have a plan today but <malay>kalau</malay>
no any other day (hmm)
<malay>kalau ni hari</malay> not much [lah] I'm just going to go home and like rest but like <malay>kalau esok</malay> maybe maybe I might go cut my hair
<malay>nak potong rambut pasal dah panjang</malay> haven't <malay>dah lama belum potong rambut</malay> so maybe I shall do that
and
ya
[oh] ya not not bald [lah] no [lah] like as in like short
I don't know I
<malay>rasa macam</malay> free [kan]
(mmhmm)
ya
I just haven't had the
the like courage to go shave my head again
I don't know like
<malay>sekarang muka macam</malay> maybe I want to keep it a bit like short but not too short <malay>macam</malay> medium length <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>tak nak panjang sangat pun</malay>
but ya
<malay>kalau kat rumah</malay> (hmm)
netflix <malay>lepas tu</malay>
[ah]
<malay>main</malay> and playing a bit of
(um)
<malay>apa lagi</malay> [ah]
(mm) ya mostly netflix if like watch so many shows over the past
(uh) no I haven't played cause like I don't know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>main dengan naim</malay> and #muhammad# they very competitive and then like if #ilyas# is not there like can't really
like tag along so like
so I usually <malay>kalau dia orang dua</malay> [jer] then I I avoid
but like <malay>kalau</malay> the rest <malay>main</malay> then <malay>aku main</malay> [ah] cause I
!huh! really I didn't know
[oh] you didn't say
did you say [oh] I didn't see
I didn't
[oh] no he means he can't even play at all ya
I mean the same thing happened <malay>bila</malay> that time I tried to download <malay>kat</malay> my macbook <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>yang</malay>
I I don't play with my macbook I play on my
cause I don't think they have a <malay>punya</malay> file
ya
(mm)
<malay>satu benda</malay>
just one (mm)
probably a house with like a farm attached
you said one thing but I didn't
[oh] ya <malay>kalau satu benda dapat rumah</malay> [ah]
ya so you like
(mm)
with its with its own private jet
no but like a house would be fine I mean it's one item
[kan]
ya I mean a house will be nice like
at least that's settled especially in singapore
<malay>kau nak beli rumah punya susah</malay>
you don't need to work anymore I mean like you can work like small little jobs
I know right
ya basically that
I mean <malay>kalau kalau kau dah ada rumah</malay> then at most <malay>kau kerja untuk</malay>
maybe your savings and then like <malay>sikit untuk makan minum</malay> bills
so but ya that's it
what what should be free
[oh]
I guess
I guess
(mmhmm)
ya
but like I guess that's how the
the world has come to [ah] like everyone all the governments own everything and then you have to pay them
unless you move to like some
like island
#yishun#
we move to an island <malay>yang tak ada orang</malay>
build their own houses that kind maybe
but ya
ya
by there's an island
I didn't know
cow
you mean there's this one like random
what on earth
coney island
ya ya I've heard of it I have never been there though
(uh) <malay>pergi</malay> [ah]
ya let's go look for that cow later
<malay>hantu</malay>
so what the cow is the <malay>hantu</malay> or like
is there
interesting we go find out [lah]
[kan]
it's an island so that means the cow wandered in on its own
I mean
maybe <malay>orang</malay> maybe like someone like <malay>dulu simpan lembu kat rumah abeh dia bawa</malay>
<malay>macam buang kat sana kesian</malay>
<malay>dia lari</malay>
but it's such a weird thing to to happen in singapore
I don't know what is the lifespan of a cow
[oh]
I mean the
the latest the one I think just got removed what the <malay>kampung</malay>
I mean there's still one that exists that like
I don't know #buangkok# some some no as in like an actual <malay>kampung macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>orang dia tinggal dalam rumah macam kayu</malay> ya
<malay>yang</malay> that time I went there <malay>untuk yang satu</malay> filming for this
<malay>cerita hantu</malay> [ah]
ya went there and then <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> (uh) <malay>tempat tu memang ada benda</malay> [ah] like there's there's actual <malay>hantu</malay> living there ya
and then like there's this one <malay>makcik</malay> [ah] like this chinese auntie
she owns the place basically and then like (uh)
they rented the house that we were filming in from her
<malay>abeh dia orang cakap macam</malay> (um) like <malay>kalau datang kat rumah tu kena macam</malay> have like
good intentions like you can't be there to <malay>macam</malay>
like give a bad name to the place and stuff
cause like previously something happened [lah] when they they tried to like film like a horror thing there and like something happened
ya I think I was telling
(mm) ya it is the thing that confuse me cause the auntie told us like [oh] I see you guys are nice people so it should be fine
she said like <malay>kalau nampak apa-apa jangan tegur</malay> [lah] just let it be
like it won't harm you unless you do anything to it
and like we film from
yes
we film from I think like we arrived there at six [ah] so we set up and stuff and then the actress for the <malay>hantu</malay> was late
like really late and then [ah] they wanted to start filming at like eight
and then we had to delay and then wait then (um) when the actress finally came I had to put her and line her <malay>punya</malay> costumes and makeup and stuff
so like she became the <malay>hantu</malay> it was quite quite interesting to see her change [ah] cause
<malay>dia</malay> [ah] she's like I think some
model or something
so she's quite tall [lah] and then like (um)
her features were like pretty [lah] like
like a model person's features
<malay>abeh kita kena tukar muka dia jadi macam hantu</malay> and then it's kind of fun [lah] but <malay>macam</malay>
(mm) that part that was the one [lah]
ya
(mm) ya we cut the the wig
then like ya at first it was like kind kind of worrying [lah] cause she kept complaining like
or like uncomfortable and this that
and then we had to put in contact lenses and stuff and it's not the normal <malay>yang kecil punya</malay> contact lenses it's a full eye one
so like
we were kind of worried [lah] that wouldn't work out but then like at the end she was okay with it so thank god [lah] like <malay>nasib</malay> [ah]
<malay>benda tu jadi</malay> so quite cool and like it was quite kind of scary [ah] to see her in the dark
like wandering around and shit
ya [lah] but then it's the only <malay>kampung</malay> I know that exists in singapore [lah]
ya
that <malay>kampung</malay>
I think the the the people who stay there are quite like welcoming
they are very nice and then the when we were there <malay>kita nampak macam</malay> (uh) <malay>tiga</malay> caucasian people #ang moh# like white people
they they were just wandering the place like
seeing
they were like <malay>dia orang datang abeh dia orang tengok tengok</malay> [ah] then <malay>dia orang nampak</malay> then <malay>kita punya</malay> filming <malay>punya benda</malay> then <malay>dia macam</malay> [oh] what you're doing
then we just like like we told them [lah] like [oh] we're filming a horror movie here
they like [oh] okay cool cool and <malay>jalan</malay>
but it's quite interesting place [ah] cause it's surrounded by
quite a few like (um) there's a lot of <malay>kampung</malay> houses [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> maybe <malay>ada lima ke enam orang</malay> [jer] <malay>tinggal sana banyak rumah yang tak ada orang</malay> [ah]
that's the thing I don't really know I only know the auntie like her job is to mainly take care of that <malay>kampung</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> she does the upkeeping and stuff [ah] and then like I know there's there's like one that they that
that hut that looks like a #kopitiam#
like <malay>ada kerusi-kerusi semua kat luar abeh macam</malay> I know that that place they close down already so I don't know what they use the space for
but it's exist now ya
ya it's very close it's like <malay>macam kalau</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> like here and then it's just <malay>kat bawah</malay>
ya it's quite interesting it's like surrounded by blocks and roads but then once you enter the <malay>kampung</malay> area you really feel like you end up somewhere else cause
the trees are quite tall
then like only behind the trees then you see the so it's quite quite cool
<malay>besar juga</malay> [ah] like maybe it's about the size of like one small area
like maybe like eight blocks <malay>gitu</malay>
ya
it's quite big ya
the houses are all like one floor [lah]
so like ya
it's all <malay>kayu</malay> and then like very old school [lah] <malay>semua macam</malay>
like no electricity and stuff
but then they I think they added in electricity so like some houses have electricity now
quite cool
stay in the <malay>kampung</malay>
[oh] visit !huh! there's mosquitoes though
that's like the one thing I just didn't like about the place like especially at night
cause we were filming until like what seven
ya it's quite <malay>gelap</malay> I mean there there is a few street lights [ah] like around the area but it's quite dark and then (um)
the there's a road that goes through the entire place [lah] so like along the road it's quite bright but like in the houses itself it's quite dark unless you are in the one with people [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tempat dia memang besar</malay> like really quite big ya
and but we only hear like
like explore like one small corner of it cause <malay>bila kita masuk kita naik</malay> lorry <malay>kena bawa semua</malay> equipment [kan] so when we brought it all out we just put it at the house there and then we were only at that house
so we only saw the surrounding by when we were in the lorry
ya
no cause like I mean kind of like #paiseh# [ah] cause we didn't like come there to explore and then they only call me down to do the stuff
so like
<malay>aku datang</malay> just <malay>tengok-tengok abeh</malay> like <malay>macam tolong sini tolong sana</malay>
and then (um)
the auntie was very nice so she's the one who came down and talk to us
like she kept coming by and like saying like [oh] !wah! so cool and stuff so it was quite quite cute
ya <malay>dah pukul lapan gitu</malay> then she came over
then she was like <malay>kau orang nampak apa-apa tak</malay> and I'm like (um) no and then she said like <malay>kalau kalau nampak apa-apa tak payah takut</malay> nothing [one]
<malay>dia hantu baik</malay> then I'm like okay
ya
she just goes around does that every time
[ah] but ya
it is a
ya
even though like you're right in the centre of everything else
but like it's quite nice [ah] it's quite cold that night
cause of all the trees and stuff
(um)
yes guardian angels
ya the auntie lives alone now quite
yes her guardians
but ya quite interesting [ah] the place
interesting
(um)
I honestly don't know [ah] I
what else to do in singapore
what what else can we explore
where
go at night [lah]
ya I think same [ah] if like I had to like
if I wanted to explore and then go to places I think I will <malay>tunggu malam baru keluar</malay> cause <malay>panas sangat</malay> like everyday it's so humid and hot
true
but
[oh] ya I'm not awake
ya to wake up at seven and like seven to eight just to go hiking is
is something else
(mm)
(mmhmm)
really
that's interesting
(uh) the zoo
is the zoo even open
open right
they wear face shields
cause we need to see them smile
cause not they will think that they are trapped
and sad
yes
yes [sia] is it even open I think it is already [lah] if not how how they make money
they need the money to keep the animals there
they shouldn't move
make them like let it be free
like the lions and elephants roam singapore
can you imagine
#pulau semakau# that's the bloody landfill right
put the cow there
I haven't been to the zoo in years
<malay>tiga tahun</malay> [eh] it's quite recent [sia]
three years quite recent [lah] ya
I mean honestly nothing much has changed so I don't know really know why how you want to keep going back to see animals in cages
ya
cat
[orh] [orh]
catty
catty enclosure
(mm)
and jumping on things
(mm)
like the other time I went I saw the polar bear
that one was depressing as hell like the polar bear's fur was like just it just looks depressed [lah] like the whole ya the bear was skinny as hell
and then like I mean their they are like naturally born for like
cold climate and stuff and singapore is nothing but that I guess it's really horrible [lah] to put polar bear in there
he died
he died
you
ya didn't look like old age [sia] the the bear just look like it was dying for years already
it was so skinny
I don't know apparently it was born in singapore
so they say like
ya I just feel like it's from #yishun#
#yishun# has cold weather and move it
but like <malay>kesian juga</malay> [ah] like you when you <malay>tengok</malay> the polar bear it's just so skinny and frail looking and like it was alone that in its entire life I think
just wandering around it's blue cage
like
I feel like a polar bear need ice
singapore is so hot
I want go <malay>yang tempat apa tu yang dekat</malay> gardens by the bay [ah]
<malay>pergi satu kali</malay> [ah] when in maybe secondary school
poly ya secondary school the last time I went
ya
it was not [meh]
it was
it was [lah] cause I don't remember wearing for things in poly
no it was in secondary school I swear I think I don't think it was in poly
cause it was very long ago
gardens
by the
I opening
(uh) five to two
and it was opened in twenty twelve
how many years ago eight years ago
ya [sia]
sec four [lah] so probably in sec four cause I don't remember going in poly
like I always go way before poly so like
end of sec four
ya
no
no it was open
they said they open in twenty twelve
twenty nine june
fifty million
visitors as of twenty eighteen
you thought one day
[orh]
it's quite pretty [lah] the the indoor garden is nice
I like
plants
that I don't mind
ya
thirty
ya all our thirty dollars
cause of gardens by the bay and #changi# airport
<malay>tiga</malay> wish
(hmm)
that's a hard question
<malay>aku nak rumah</malay>
but legit [lah] like
basically the first thing I would ask
for is a house like
a dream house
like not not in singapore somewhere cold
right ya
(oo)
true
not worry about anything
and then they just make you like someone who doesn't care about anything anymore
that's what genies can do
so if your wish is from a genie then ya
genie in the bottle
(hmm)
I would wish to be
legit
no that's such a tiring job [oh] my god
I would wish to be richer than jeff bezos
so I can own him
and then I take all his money and give everyone else
<malay>entah abeh</malay>
but ya I just would wish for like unimaginable amount of money I think that would solve a lot of problems
(mmhmm)
the money won't exist
okay like that like that imaginable amount of money
like a whole filled with cash that amount
and like by cash is like hundred dollars bills not by twenty cents
then like ya that amount of money
and use it to
or maybe find the cure to every disease in the world
and then use it to make money
that's what everyone does
(mm)
yes
can you imagine having like the the power to
solve every disease out there
ya some some random white guy gonna make billions out of that
should do it
but what was your third wish
what was your third wish
[oh] ya
just be like unbothered
yes
ya
(mm)
ya previous
(mm) money is like half of our issues
true
can you imagine if you had like three wishes and then first wish was to wish for five hundred more of you
what with five hundred clones
I don't know then everyone of you got like three more wishes
that would be cool
I guess
someone getting their wishes
don't know
(mmhmm)
(mm)
so what the hell
!wow!
plot twist
genies
ya
but like would you waste your wish on that
[oh]
(mm)
fair
why
ya
yes
right
COVID has been putting so many things on hold
how life has changed in like what less than a year
it's so weird
all like
in december last year we were all like
being crazy and having fun and like
not even thinking and then suddenly in february
right
being in school like right now
not on zoom classes
ya ya sure
ya but life would be so different without having to scan your
your code
everywhere you go
and
I guess ya
true true
just hide your identity all the time
ya I love it
ya
and that's nice
but like the safe entry thing is kind of annoying
(oo) okay [lah] <malay>kalau dia orang nak kasih</malay> free <malay>ambil</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>kalau kalau bayar</malay> then okay [ah] <malay>aku bingit</malay> but then <malay>kalau</malay> free
then collect <malay>dekat</malay> <malay>dekat rumah aku</malay> okay [lah] and
I mean ya <malay>memang</malay> [ah] like <malay>buang masa juga</malay> cause
they tell you like [oh] you you don't need the code I mean you need the token thing <malay>abeh</malay> it's not like it's as if you walk past and scan it you have to actually bring to the person to scan
so what's the difference of like using that compared to your right it's literally does nothing different
(mm)
or like if it actually has like any actual benefits like
I don't know like they actually know exactly where we are that kind of thing
so like whoever you actually come in contact with that has COVID then they can track
but like from what I've heard there's no in it [ah] so like
probably not
(mmhmm)
and they haven't really spoken much about it like
on the on the news and stuff like it's just very hush like you just come and collect that's it
I didn't even know
(mm)
(mm)
no one was interested
ya
(mmhmm)
ya they
into this kind of stuff ya
I mean okay [lah] to be fair like the older generations some of them don't have smartphones
so like for them to access like
shopping malls and stuff will be hard
but like they have their and that's something I know like old people won't lose
so like
ya
(mmhmm)
you know it's like you can't drop it you can't
get it like near water
like I'm pretty sure someone's gonna drop it
yes
drop it like right after you get it
like in front of the person like !oops!
I mean if it had if had like data in it like would you mind
why
monitored
but I don't think <malay>macam</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
true
(mm)
but I mean if it's in the government then like
kinda messed up if the government is using it to
make fund like
criminal stuff
(mm)
I guess
I miss cats
ya
cat cafe
[orh]
same
I just I cannot imagine like
<malay>tak suka</malay>
[oh]
I was like !huh!
ya
<malay>kat bawah</malay> block
!huh! <malay>sini takde banyak kucing</malay>
[oh] that's weird
the hell
only got <malay>lembu</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
have you seen your cat <malay>luar</malay>
have your seen your cat
that cat
I also haven't see
when I go down
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
your cat is wild
yes
that cat deserves to be in a zoo
have its own like
safari at like enclosure
<malay>seram</malay> [sia]
true
does your aunt is your aunt scared of cats
[orh]
(mm)
ya
fur gets everywhere though
allergies
how
that's weird
(mm)
you know when I first got my cat it was that bad [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
(hmm) <malay>bila</malay> like I have carry the cat and stuff my nose will like start like getting blocked then I'll be coughing
<malay>abeh batuk rabak</malay> [sia] it's like cannot breathe and stuff
and then ya I would like cough and then have trouble breathing
<malay>sekarang</malay> if I carry him it's still fine but like my face gets itchy [ah] like if he comes too close like my face
and then <malay>kalau</malay> when I <malay>mandi</malay> him like
that's when it gets bad [lah] like he I really cannot breathe like I will start coughing
and stuff
but I don't know what is the reason for it I think it's
ya
bathe them right ya but like
stinks ya
he hates it [lah] but like it's fine (uh) it's fine [lah] he just hates it he doesn't like
aggressive
[oh] really
[orh]
I mean get scared [lah] like you can his face he doesn't want to be there
he has that like let me go face but then
like I think he's fine [lah] like cause I I usually carry him while I bathe him
like he's in my hands
what
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
but like
you mean like what like people like make the virus or
this happens
(mm)
(mmhmm)
I guess but
I don't know like why is it more common now than like back then or like I mean like to me it's been every every few years confirm got like some
global pandemic [what] then like
every year we just come out with like better medicine and stuff
to like combat it so like
I don't think it would wipe out the human race like but I mean people will die [lah] confirm but like
[oh]
(mm)
faster
that makes sense
into climate change
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I think there comes a point where you have to like stop
cause like
how advance do we need to be
stop
just leave
seven hundred languages
ya I mean like really at what point do we stop having to <malay>macam</malay> pursue technology
cause like I feel like everything is fine as it is
like I mean if you want to find like cures and like
(mm)
is put to use
ya
(mm)
somewhere else
that needs it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
think that's the issue with like most
like everyone
chasing money
money ya I think the next president should just remove money
there is not no money
the president speaks in malay <malay>kau orang semua</malay> stop it [eh]
what the
but do you hear about the the that orchard towers thing
the murder thing the guy got off with a warning
can you imagine like in the courtroom the judge is just like okay I think <malay>kau dah bunuh orang ni tapi</malay> I just I just want to give you a warning [eh] <malay>kau</malay> stop [jer] [eh] <malay>jangan buat lagi</malay> [tau]
then okay <malay>kau balik</malay> like
the guy was like in for like murder charge and then he just like
escape with nothing
ya
<malay>siapa</malay>
[ah] ya
ya
ya
murderers
ya
[oh] well
ya [sia] and then the girl got like sponsorship opportunity and stuff
nonsensical [sia] like how
why

that lady was like [oh] (err) are you still are you still in are you still serving

(mm) !huh!
!hais!
you know you know my my <malay> encik wanted me to extend six months [eh]
I was like
the the amount of work I have to do
two point four
three is that [one] is before (err) [ah] but six months is a very long
think so I don't know [lah]
no but the thing is I don't I don't want to do that the job scope anymore
it's just too taxing [ah]
[a'ah]
I would extend if I'm doing like admin work [ah] honestly if they give me admin work for the next six months I'd take it
I would not
[eh] I would not think twice
(err) I I don't like my <malay> encik (uh)
I just
I just don't like my <malay> encik [ah] that's all
ya serious [ah]
one last talk
[oh] I see
[oh] [ho] <malay> dua jam
[oh] I see
<malay> kau punya
<malay> kau punya boss <malay> apa umur
okay [ah] <malay> muda [ah]
<malay> aku punya kau kau rasa aku punya berapa
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
<malay> apa otai [sia] <malay> orang tua
I see I see
no [lah] okay so (uh)
<malay> kira I don't like working with my <malay> encik [ah] it's just like <malay> macam
<malay> kau bayangkan
(err) <malay> kau kau ikut apa dia orang dia suruh kau buat tahu
okay then <malay> tiba tibs
<malay> dia tambah lagi dia tambah dia tambah dia tambah tambah tambah aku [dah] tak boleh tak boleh tahan [lah]
then <malay> macam
when we expect him to cover for us [eh] <malay> macam we do what he expect us to do
and then
there's a second layer so basically <malay> macam my <malay> encik is my first level
to [eh] no sorry my
is my first level to to complaint [lah] <malay> katakan
and then followed by my <malay> encik
and then basically then go up to [ah] so there's this
thing in [eh] there's one more layer in between my and my <malay> encik which is that directing staff
this directing staff is external
okay so there's a
particular set of people that like really
(err)
(err) expect a lot from the from us [ah]
basically so <malay> macam
standby area is at seven thirty seven forty five
he they expect us to be there before that
I don't know
[a'ah] ya
and okay so you know how in
(err) they say [oh] okay (err) the duty sergeant or the duty officer will be the [one] doing all this (err)
all these checks right correct
(uh huh) okay
so we also have the
<malay> macam what's
we also had the schedule [lah]
okay who's duty on monday duty tuesday duty wednesday so on and so forth
okay so let's say specifically
that day was wednesday
okay and then unfortunately the
directing staff was one of the
(err) the [one] that we don't like [lah]
like he expect us to be there he expect us to check he expect us to do everything
and okay
the the thing about (err) the duty (err) is like only one person supposed to be there correct or not
okay so
for example I have five sergeants one person will do the check for that day or for that morning [ah] <malay> katakan
then
so this directing staff came down he was like [oh] (err) what time already I was like !huh!
what do you mean he's like (err) why I only see one sergeant why I don't see all the sergeant here then it's like !huh!
what you expect [sia] you expect all the sergeant to be down here during the check [ah]
you get what I mean
ya [lah]
cause like so
that means those people not on duty need to go down and do check [ah] rather than preparing for what's to come for the day like [ha]
ya like as we got okay we got so much limited so very limited resource
and he wants to use all the resources just for one small
check <malay> gitu something like that [lah]
so we're like (err) when when I going it was like [ah] don't care already [ah] because
maybe one one more week or two more weeks left with them so I was like I don't care already [ah]
ya
I mean I I just worry for my
under studies [ah]
(um)
okay okay
what you have done [lah] [ha]
sometimes like I think sometimes you cannot really like do
like full comparison like okay like between you and him
maybe okay how how were you like when you just came into the unit was there like a proper handover or
[oh] don't have [eh]
okay then I guess (err)
(mmhmm)
okay [lah] but okay that
and he still cannot
(mmhmm)
last week
that one your problem [ah]
just say that [lah]
[oh]
(err) you feel bad for him [ah]
okay [lah] okay [lah]
your brother [ah] your brother [ah]
I guess ya
<malay> aku lain aku everyday [jer] stress [ah]
I have to
<malay> kau imagine okay <malay> kau imagine (err)
let's say okay you you're taking this batch for one month
like then (um)
within that four weeks there is a few weekend correct
are are you being disturbed on weekends or no
sometimes [ah]
then for me if I am every week every day
my phone will ring my phone will message got ping [one] confirm I tell you vibrate or whatever [lah]
everyday will do and everyday !hais! that's why I'm getting tired of it
example like (err) interacting with
well
I have to deal with forty two recruits
[oh] then (err) the the recruit asking me if I single also that one [ah]
is it
serious I got
like (uh) no [lah] no no no I got one I got one guy during my right
he he was in a relationship with one other guy pin pin in his
in his (uh) vocation training
okay so what happened was (uh) they broke up
they broke up and I was and I was the direct (err) seccom
so ya so like I have to <malay> macam
coax him [ah] like [oh] [eh] don't like (err)
(err) feel bad [lah] don't don't think like it's the end or something [lah] whatever
then finishing the course [ah] he come to me he say sergeant single or not what the heck

uni changes people [eh]

okay so the topics that we will be talking today [ah] it's (um) firstly
if you got if you could go back in time or forward to the future in ten years where or when would you go maybe you want to start first
(um) fifty <malay>betul</malay>
so <malay>maknanya kalau</malay> (uh) <malay>kalau</malay> if you <malay>yang</malay> in ten years time <malay>memang</malay> you want to be in an area <malay>yang ada laut yang ada</malay> greenery where
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>kalau untuk saya</malay> for me [eh] I think [eh]
for me [ah] I like science [lah] so maybe ten years in the future [kan] I would want to have
I would like to live in my own lab <malay>atau</malay> garage
and maybe <malay>sebelah</malay> would be my like lab apparatus <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
and I would like to live with my my family members
and I would like to have my own lab so that I can do most of my research and [ah] whatever there is [lah] so
there will be one and like to
to work on research and another thing also (uh) ten years time probably (um) I would like to
(uh) I would like to be in
in a safe place whereby I can
I can have
can have my own fun time like a playground and I like it to be very secluded like maybe in the woods or something so or in a cave
so that's that's what I will I will I will like to go and
so if I have my own lab I would probably (uh) maybe add a telescope <malay>atau</malay> like some meeting devices so that I can
focus on my (uh)
my computing whatsoever [lah]
yes
(mmhmm) <malay>betul</malay>
so
alright
so moving on
so maybe (uh) so moving on maybe we will let's
okay so (mm)
<malay>katanya</malay> if say let's say you were
(uh) you were in your future house
and then (um) maybe if there are like a few drama picks that maybe you you can watch
what what genre or what kind of drama or what titles
would you actually like to have in your home
to watch in your free time
and why
(mm)
mind is stimulated [ah]
martial arts <malay>gitu</malay>
(uh) more to like action thriller
<malay>macam nak kena</malay>
(uh) okay for for me (uh) I really like sci-fi and action so probably all the genres which I will like to watch probably star trek
star wars or black mirror cause I think
when you are in technology and there are several different things that you can encounter there
and it gives you (uh) in-hand situations about (uh) about issues that could surface in the future [lah] (uh) technology areas or
(uh) any political issues ya so I think it's very stimulating for me and (um) I think it it it gives me like <malay>macam</malay>
something to think about
ya and and make you like [oh] it helps me to
solve problems easily and (uh) see things in a different perspective so tonight there's this one episode [eh]
<malay>yang satu orang ni</malay> (uh) she was actually (uh) she was actually trapped in a spaceship
the reason why she was trapped is because (um)
(uh) her her boss took a of her and other of her colleagues and the boss actually
computed her body into into a technological (uh) into a computer-generated programme so meaning her colleagues and herself were actually in a spaceship and they have no control of returning or whatsoever because their was generated fun fact it was actually their clone [ah] <malay>orang sendiri</malay> [tau] so
so the boss <malay>memang memang jahat</malay> [ah] <malay>gilanya orang</malay>
the boss actually had to so so only the boss can control the game
and very interesting [lah] how they plan to (uh) get rid of the boss cause
but the boss itself he he portray himself as the captain
and then [ah] sometimes he can [ah] turn this beam into whatever he want to or torture them in a way so technically the people itself them them self were were were were shocked [lah] cause their was extorted and they were like stuck there so they had to in the end (uh) some of them still got to plan how to
how to throw him off so (uh) he was actually very surprised when they managed to escape from them from him because it was a black hole and (uh) there was a wormhole so they went they went into that and then they manage to escape [lah] so it was quite surprising interesting [ah] how they plan out the activities and how they hack into the current
ya
okay so okay so apart from that [eh] (hmm)
if you can become an actor
(uh) what
(hmm) if you can become an actor [eh] and like any actor [eh] do you prefer (uh) do you prefer to have like good looks or a fit body
ya what what what will you what will you prefer actually if you can become an actor but then
if you can become if you can ask no if you like can become an actor right what
what would you like to focus more good looks or fit body
ya
no as in like no as in no if you can become an actor usually actors they can focus on
like their their image you know what I mean <malay>faham tak</malay> ya so an image of them self you mean <malay>nak</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>ada</malay> fit body <malay>atau</malay> good looks
<malay>kenapa</malay>
so you are saying like having a healthy lifestyle
keeps you keeps you going
<malay>betul betul</malay>
(mm)
I think I will
I think I agree on that [lah] <malay>sebab kalau kalau sekiranya macam ada wajah yang cantik pun</malay> [eh] <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay> if you can't like run
ten miles when you don't have the stamina or the health then <malay>buat apa</malay> [lah]
ya so I think for me <malay>kalau ada</malay> fit body is more satisfying <malay>sebab</malay>
for health is technically is more is the is the most important thing for you to live in this in this world [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> without without health actually (um) you can be bedridden and even the the cost of (uh)
medicine is getting medicine and healthcare is [ah] not getting cheaper these days
so I think (uh) focus on health and and intervening myself from any diseases [ah] correct I can you know feel the best of my life for the next few years
so <malay>macam</malay> I think health is very important [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> without health <malay>memang</malay> you <malay>tak boleh buat</malay> much [lah] you can't do much actually
<malay>mencegah</malay>
<malay>kena</malay> start <malay>awal</malay> [lah]
so I think one <malay>kalau</malay> pot from having a fit body [eh]
I think
like all you said a healthy body I think it's also important to have a healthy mind <malay>sebab sekarang memang</malay> as you can see [eh] mental health is very prevalent especially among the youth (err) among the working adults and among (um) teens
so what do you think about that
or how can mental health be
be (um) how can mental health be (um) what's that addressed
and how can be (um)
how can we (uh) better improve our mental health area general
<malay>cara</malay> holistic [lah]
I think mental health also like (uh) stems from other external factors <malay>macam</malay> maybe overwhelming of
school work <malay>atau</malay>
(uh) projects or work or something which like humans itself has a limit and they actually
probably they cannot handle the stress that they have [lah] that they experience so (um) like if you can see like the education system <malay>kat</malay> singapore <malay>sekarang memang</malay> very (uh)
very rigorous very very broad and very
it's very intense [lah] so like what <malay>macam</malay>
for for me because I've I've I've been in the education system and <malay>macam memang</malay> I've been schooling [ah] and I think <malay>macam</malay> there's a lot of
things that has yet to be addressed like maybe like mental health support I think mental health support is very important to see how children can take care of themselves
(uh) rather than you know focusing on grades and rather for rather than focusing on how to get the best result but most ultimately they find whatever they are interested in and whatever they
can do on their level and if they can't do it the the the schools shouldn't push
well you know I think schools should given [ah] should give them ample time or and or the flexibility to learn
what do you think
depends on the capacity [ah]
but <malay>tu memang</malay>
(uh) off them from whether you like to learn or you
you enjoy it because if you don't enjoy it I think they won't see like a point of doing it
I think that's a blunder in our education system [ah] like they make everyone else do everything but it's not really what it's not really suited or
but it doesn't really appease them so I think <malay>macam</malay> apparently the education system has been the same for more than hundred years but (uh) everything has been changing and revolutionised
but like the education system is still there I think that that there's a there's a you have to not trick the system we have to improvise the system so that
(uh) it gives not only education to students or to everyone but it helps them to learn or or you train their mind on how to learn not what to learn because I feel that every every single time my friends when they enter school when they enter when they when they take test they actually memorise everything and I think that's very futile it's pointless <malay>sebab apa</malay> [tau] if you memorise everything
then we won't learn anything we're just spitting out whatever you learn or and you <malay>macam</malay> just just <malay>kasi semua</malay> on paper but you don't actually learn or having or you don't even get the gist of it like for example even in exams they ask you
(um)
(um) how many one point two grams of (uh) phosphorus is needed to make (uh) I don't know cyanide or something
<malay>macam</malay> apparently to some students maybe it maybe it just stimulate their practical thinking but what students don't like chemistry or physics [lah] and ya I think I don't don't think they will find the benefit in learning that or applying that in life so maybe it's a it's a good discussion <malay>bila macam</malay>
you can think of how to (uh) not only educate people but training their mind how to think training their mind how to accept new ideas how to make use make full use of the time to learn new things apart from you know just studying for exam memorise then vomiting everything out I think it's really futile in the end they don't know what they want to do then
<malay>macam susah</malay> [lah] [kan]
okay so (uh) moving on maybe let's talk about
(mm) okay so <malay>contohnya</malay> like for now [eh] we are in the twentieth twenty first century
so technically if you were if you can go back
to the past okay like any year or any time period or wherever [ah] where would you want to go
and why
ya
<malay>cuba</malay> like for example [eh] you <malay>ternampak</malay> a time capsule
and you can just enter whatever year
place period and date you want to go where would you want
why
[oh] when you were a little child
work studies stress [ah]
we play
(mm)
I think that's <malay>pun</malay> what I would really <malay>macam</malay> really cherish enjoy
cause our childhood is like it's it's somehow
(uh) memories in child somehow sticks with you for your life
(um) shape you and how you are today
[ah]
probably (mm)
I I think I would want to go to
<malay>zaman</malay>
I don't know maybe <malay>zaman rasulullah</malay> <malay>atau</malay> dark ages [ah] cause (um) basically the dark ages were <malay>macam</malay> a period of time
the <malay>macam</malay>
ya during the dark ages were a period of time whereby (uh) in the european universe or the western part of the world
[ah] there were so many diseases and plague
so
apparently during that time many people died most of the population less doctors about one third or I'm not so sure about the statistic but (uh) there was a really huge plague and there were a lot of
(um) ya there were a lot of wars and it was a very bloody time a really bloody time there was there was there was a lot of deaths
during that time and [ah] people were killed and people were died from (um)
(um) unknown
and unprecedented diseases so
if I could go back during that time
and if I could travel the world then I would see that I would find like solution on how to like you know
how to counter the illness or whatsoever but apart from
(uh) the west side
I think I think during the dark ages also there were there were the golden age of inventions because I think during that time there was a lot of inventions from muslim scholars ya like you know #sina# [ah] #al jazali#
(uh) #mariam#
#rolab# and I think those were the ages where where there were a lot of inventions like you know the sultans of science <malay>bila</malay> there's this two brothers
#abu sayde# or something but very very they just it was it was a golden age of islam [lah] I think it's very interesting to see
I think it's very interesting to see <malay>macam</malay>
the the progression during that period of times <malay>sebab sebab</malay> during that time <malay>memang memang tak ramai orang ada tak ramai orang dapat keluarkan</malay> idea <malay>macam gitu</malay>
<malay>seperti</malay>
inventing the clock invention of the scalpel
so there were a lot of inventions during that time which actually
which actually benefited
this
generation apart from like medicine
medicine engineering
I think there was a lot of things it was a lot of discoveries and inventions which are untold during the golden age
during the golden age and I find it really interesting <malay>sebab</malay> how their mind
I think it's even
it's it's very it may it may appear far-fetched during that time but I think
it's very interesting on how they manage to combine it's like
things and how they manage to become a poly math
even in engineering and science and (uh) it can do like a lot of things at once and I think that's something that's (um) <malay>macam kita jarang tengok</malay> [ah]
<malay>dalam dunia ni sekarang</malay> [tau] most of the time [kan] <malay>kadang-kadang macam contohnya</malay> [eh] I have to (um) <malay>contohnya</malay> I have to pursue the road after my O levels just for engineering will it set where I want to go maybe not but I like to pursue maybe engineering medicine (uh) philosophy literature of course I like to learn a lot of things at once [lah] but I think <malay>macam</malay> ya I think it'll be very interesting [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> you can like learn
a lot of other things rather than focusing on one so that you know you can expand our knowledge
yup
ya
is it in my job plus for too long
<malay>sebab saya rasa macam</malay>
<malay>tak sampai mana-mana macam ilmu ni bukan terak laginya luas kalau kita dapat ilmu tu kita</malay> just go far
<malay>sebab ilmu tu mana-mana</malay> and you can use for <malay>ilmu ilmu ilmu payah ke ilmu</malay>
you [ah]
<malay>ilmu apa tu pengetahuan ke apa</malay> as long as <malay>kita ada ilmu kita gunakan dengan baik</malay> and I think it will be very fruitful [lah]
<malay>ilmu</malay>
so apart from like
(mm) going back in time
(um) what do you think would be three wishes that you think you would want
to (uh) have
for example you come across a lamp then you can rub it and then a genie comes in front of you what what three wishes would you actually like to (um) to ask him
you like here
it looks like a normal [lah] you particularly the elderly man take
(um) <malay>duit ke rumah ke</malay>
<malay>betul betul</malay>
the third one
[ah]
(uh) I think first [lah] I think I'm really content in life but if I could ask for more I wish like
(uh) I wish
(uh) I wish that (uh) world hunger can be stopped [lah] cause
or war actually can be stopped cause technically (um) <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau boleh</malay> share but technically like (uh) world hunger among there are many (um) palestinians
and they went in first world country
hunger itself is very it's hard to address because poverty is it might be out of reach to most of us and especially during this COVID [eh] <malay>macam susah</malay> [seh] <malay>orang nak macam macam nak dicakap ada sebab memang</malay> now <malay>orang</malay> [eh] actually <malay>tengah kelaparan yang kadang tak ada kerja yang tak ada</malay> no access to <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) no access to water even to not not even water like they only have access to like polluted water or or like urine from (uh) camels or
cattle so
it's it's very sad [lah] so if I can if I can have wishes if I can have one wish I'll choose the first wish if I have three wishes one of them would be I hope [ah] nobody would go hungry [lah] in this world
and [ah] the second wish would be [ah]
I want to have my
own space shuttle so that I can travel in the cosmos or in the space
so that I can be with a job for life I think that's very safe cause (uh) we don't have the technology
because even from (um) the nearest got small century to earth is like four point two light years away and one light year is about three hundred and eighty thousand
[eh] three hundred and eighty three point eight times the power of
metres kilometres kilometres
so (um) I think it will be very hard but I think it
working good effort to actually wanting to telephone us
so I think having a space shuttle and discovering life
and helping out (um) others or venturing into the cosmos studying about stuff analyse black holes it's very interesting
and for third wish (uh) actually (uh) I think I
I wish to have my own family one day #inshallah#
maybe next five ten years or so
so I think (um) having a family really <malay>macam</malay>
really helps me to
(uh) have a more positive outlook on life where I could learn from my spouse
I think for me learning is very for me [lah] I really like to learn
and <malay>kalau ada suami</malay> I would be able to
find solace in him cause <malay>memang allah turunkan kita dalam pasangan</malay> [kan] so I think having a spouse would be very interesting [lah]
not like I want I want know
I'm not even dating but (um) just hope to you know
(um) get married one day
okay so (mm)
so maybe (uh) cause since we had three wishes that we have we we can would you like to add anything like any wish that comes to your mind so far
<malay>akhlak yang baik</malay> [lah]
I eat right
I think (uh) I think
<malay>tu</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I can feel you [lah] I think having (uh) having status
is not really essential [lah] but apparently
(uh) you want your friend or anything
even if you want me to have good <malay>akhlak</malay>
how can I contribute better to the society
<malay>tak ada gunanya kalau kita ada akal</malay> okay <malay>kita tak</malay>
<malay>kita kurang berakhlak</malay>
<malay>tak ada gunanya kalau kita ada duit yang banyak tapi akhlak kita</malay>
<malay>hancur</malay> [tau]
cause when you like have a good attitude in life and
I think
<malay>akhlak</malay> is more valuable [lah] than intellect
<malay>akhlak</malay> [lah] actually even if you have your own
(uh) if you have your own character you have your own good moral values
you can actually be (uh) be taught to the world
but (um) having good character actually
have you succeed in life not that you
were great and good attitude to do something really helps you to
move further in life [lah]
yup
respect
won't look down on you [lah]
<malay>betul betul</malay>
<malay>buat yang baik</malay> [lah]
you <malay>tak ada gunanya</malay>
bad reputation
and apparently we want to be we want to be remembered as someone who's
who's actually who's (um)
who's who's of good nature
okay
I I will agree with you [lah] that (uh) having a good moral virtue is I mean good moral is very important in a person
so maybe you move on to next question
maybe like (um) what do you think if you <malay>macam kiranya kalau kita ada macam</malay> superpower
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> superpower like you <malay>nak jadi apa kalau</malay> what what what will you like to have right now
flash
speed [ah] speed
#inshallah#
<malay>kalau ada barang nak kemas</malay> #inshallah# [lah]
<malay>kalau</malay> you know I <malay>rasa</malay>
(uh huh)
I I like to teleport [ah]
<malay>sebab kalau</malay> I <malay>dapat</malay> teleport [kan]
I <malay>takkan lambatnya</malay> cause I'm like always late <malay>kalau dapat</malay> teleport then <malay>macam</malay> on on the speed of light or even faster than that (uh) just like be wherever I want to be just teleport <malay>tak tak payah nak</malay> passport <malay>semua</malay> so I think that's very cool [ah] <malay>kalau kalau kalau dapat</malay> teleport [lah]
I think the current technology <malay>memang tak boleh</malay> [lah] unless <malay>kita ada</malay> transporter <malay>macam kat</malay> star trek <malay>ke</malay> but of course not [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
<malay>tapi contohnya</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau macam</malay> now's the <malay>kalau</malay> cause <malay>sekarang</malay> <malay>memang</malay> is in progress [lah] what what do you think of
what do you think of like robots doing the work cause technically like what we are using now even phones
I think
phones <malay>pun</malay> is a machine so that's the that's functions in it
(mmhmm)
<malay>sekarang</malay> google [jer]
you know is is very easily easy [lah] I mean everything you could wish accidents like
know when to use it
<malay>macam kerja rumah semua terbengkalai</malay>
I think okay [lah] maybe <malay>salah saya juga</malay> <malay>sebab</malay> phone <malay>tu memang</malay> it serves like an educational purpose [lah]
ya and the entertainment purpose <malay>untuk zaman sekarang</malay>
cause I think phone are just available everywhere internet is available everywhere so
then it it seeks like entertainment but I think if you really like put a stop to it where where we feel like [oh] [ah] when we have like other other priorities to do like if if we have priorities
to do like (um) we have (uh) we have to maybe cook for the family or do laundry (um) some more if you need help you cannot still adhere to (um) playing our phone okay there are several things that we have to keep in keep in mind [lah] that there are other priorities that should be done
cause right now even learning learning is through phone is through media
(err) is through internet okay most people use google as their teacher
so I think ya it's a very different generation [lah]
I think phone also like you know serve like as a better communication with with others
but I think we we need to learn like when to use it and how to manage our time
so back to the question what do you think of do you think is something
which you could expect in the future
human touch
I think (uh) (uh) this thing
trait between and humans probably (uh) they don't have the emotional attribute
they don't have (um)
they don't have emotions or they lack like dopamine serotonin in especially in humans humans <malay>ada</malay> this kind of chemicals
you can react to certain things <malay>tapi macam</malay> they are programmed to do these things and then what happens are like programmed to weaponise or kill people I think that will be very scary in the future where yeah it's very scary hopefully can be used for good
cause it's very (um) like in the future it's very unknown but in a sense that you think I think <malay>agaknya</malay> also I feel it's on the good side [lah] because
I think reduce human labour or give companions companionship cause nowadays you can see that some
(uh) some (uh) some pioneers or some older people they they they they feel lonely so maybe having an to talk to would be like
important I think apart from that I think <malay>macam</malay> humans should actually still take care of their parents and <malay>macam</malay> don't just leave them do it by themselves because technically humans we need to feel interaction and <malay>contohnya macam</malay>
(uh) for example labour like being a waitress I think it's okay but at the same time
humans they'll be stuck of like where to learn where to
how to learn and how to do a job even a menial job like
(uh) like a like a constructor or telecomm imagine they cannot address questions then <malay>macam mana</malay> [seh] [kan]
<malay>ada</malay> limit to it
I think one <malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>pun</malay> very subjective [lah] <malay>sebab kita orang tak tahu</malay> like in the future what is the government's plan what are the engineers' plan
let's hope things could do things work out well and they don't use to like weaponise or do something [lah] something bad cause technically we want something good out of it
need deep thoughts deep thinking
deep thinking
I think ya technically <malay>macam</malay> you can see like the the human population of the world is can be overpopulated and also at some
some regions in the world <malay>macam</malay> india they are very overpopulated <malay>kalau kita dah ada</malay> robot <malay>lagi mana nak letak</malay> [seh] human <malay>ni</malay> so apart from like apart from like moving to mars or europa I think will be very difficult [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> you have to find a contingency plan <malay>sebab memang dunia ni</malay> maybe won't be enough for the for the rest of the human beings and to house robots so maybe very interesting [lah] to actually to predict and cause nowadays <malay>memang</malay>
(um) especially with the global climate
imagine if you will be using a lot of electricity
to power things where where are we gonna get these sustainable options
and humans I don't think we're gonna live for very long maybe left one thousand years like what to
probably will be (um) probably will be diminish or whatsoever but I think
(uh) like what I said can serve a good purpose or a bad one
it depends on how we look at it [lah]
but not
like from like some the like there are some movies or dramas like
humans <malay>dorang betul-betul kena</malay>
I find it very like perplexing but still very interesting [ah] to actually think about like imagine imagine will be teachers it'll be very scary because
I don't think
the I don't think students will actually
I don't think they're able to learn as much as how they actually learn from (um) human beings and like imagine they become teachers they will learn how to punish teach and they don't know how to engage the students it'll be very difficult
even if has an appearance of a human being nowadays there are so many so many (um) so many notions so many ideas that can be used as like companion dolls
like for I think it's very
but I think I understand right I think would be good to counter people for example people who likes to kill or like or or who likes to start war for even even <malay>macam</malay> greedy greedy people who are in like in charge of companies if can actually take charge of
can take can take charge of a certain organisation or and if they have the capacity to do that maybe even even a better capacity than a human being I think it'll be very interesting to see [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> (um) some people like humans like if we if we discuss we have emotions have impulses we have intentions but for they don't have that they can only follow whatever you they are programmed to do so probably the risk of making mistakes will be lesser
very interesting
(uh huh)

okay hi #hamza# how was your day today

okay why
only because it's easier
yup
(mm)
but you just want to pass right !aiya!
okay [orh]
ya for me today was okay [ah]
<malay>apa tu</malay> (err)
<malay>tadi</malay>
today today was my off day
and I got like three days off you know how I told you <malay>macam</malay> I
<malay>ada kira-kira</malay>
<malay>sepuluh hari lagi</malay> left
of (err) leave to clear and like it's been taking me forever to try and clear my
ya my leave [lah] then
(err) I've been trying to clear so
slowly slowly [ah] slowly <malay>gila</malay>
then like (um)
today we had some random meeting
about (err) strength training like (err) for media analyst and
the whole melt waters melt water (um)
like the whole company [lah] from asia pacific to australia to
what's that to #shanghai# and what not
ya and like the forgot which teams [lah] but
ya it was practically like a
workshop where they told us
they like share with us what our
strengths are because we had to take like this test [lah] before
going for this
workshop ya so like I found out that some of my
strengths was quite reflective
(mm) it's like a strengths test like a aptitude test like that
ya what are my strength
ya but they didn't look at more on strengths (uh) they didn't even ask anything about the weaknesses so I think a bit <malay>macam</malay>
a bit
<malay>apa tu senget</malay>
ya
ya a bit skewed (err) ya a bit skewed [ah] the questions but it's it's just basically to see your strengths
ya
it's like strength
strength analysis workshop something like that
[ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] ya
then we had to break up in groups and all that then after that right after we broke up in groups
(err)
the first time we broke up into groups I was put together with the my boss's boss
like this guy called luke or something I forgot his name
but <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>dia</malay>
ya I was inside luckily I had one of my colleagues inside there so it was my colleague and then another person from the #shanghai# branch and then ya we just shared [lah] then
I went first in that group and when I went first
the <malay>apa tu</malay> the
I took like I think around three minutes [lah] let's say
then we all spoke right but then the break up room was about to stop already then we only left with one more guy which that which was that boss guy [lah] the luke guy my boss's boss ya
so like he's like [oh] (err) there's not much time left but my strengths is this this this
then he like he he he talk talk talk so he got cut halfway it was quite funny ya
because like ya so they will say like ten nine eight seven six five four there's a countdown [lah] to tell them to tell us that the break room is (err) going to be closed
ya so it was quite funny then they had another second break up but my computer kind of (um) shut down on the zoom [orh]
[eh] not shut not my computer shut down like
my computer like the zoom didn't respond
I think because of the change in the break up like from the break up rooms to the zoom meeting
so ya I had to close my zoom and then reopen again
ya nothing wrong with my computer don't worry ya so it was it was okay [lah] not bad
then after that the second one I found out that some of my teammates just halfway they just left damn rude right
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [seh] <malay>kurang ajar gila</malay>
it's not it's <malay>tak</malay> compulsory <malay>tapi macam</malay>
good to know [lah] when you put in effort to you know
to make it happen ya
ya
then how was your last week
[oh] that sucks
(mm) do you think you should have studied or started earlier
sure #bo#
sure #bo#
[ah]
[eh] <malay>asal</malay> you <malay>tak baca dulu sebelum</malay> you <malay>buat</malay> paper
!huh!
can like that [meh]
okay I think that was me in in <malay>apa tu</malay> in
secondary school also when <malay>kita buat</malay> lit
ya
then why you take
[ah] okay okay understand understand
okay <malay>jap</malay>
speedy <malay>ni</malay>
speedy <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia tak nak berbual dengan kita pastu selalu gini</malay> [tau] like everytime <malay>dia</malay>
everytime <malay>kita nak</malay> everytime I want to talk to him right then he always run away but then when we don't need him around he's always ya he's always around like what the hell
ya [seh]
okay [lah] okay [lah] <malay>tak cukup</malay> attention
<malay>tak cukup apa tak cukup</malay> attention <malay>kesian dia</malay>
but ya (uh)
actually my last week was quite interesting [ah]
not interesting
but <malay>apa tu</malay>
but
(err) because remember I had one colleague jaden
no not jaden smith just jaden (err) he joined the new shift [lah]
ya my three shift correct
so <malay>dia baru</malay> join
so it like his first day was just me and him
because there was this other person but he <malay>selalu</malay>
[oh] no that day he that day
me and jaden
<malay>kena</malay>
left by like we were sent we were like left to our own devices by our senior because that senior had to do (err)
what was that (err) had to go to the dentist for a
wisdom tooth surgery
ya it was quite <malay>rabak</malay> (uh)
it was quite horrible because he said he told us in the he told me the night before texted me [eh] just tomorrow
(err) tomorrow what's that [ah] [oh] tomorrow
I may not be able to [oh] no tomorrow I might need to leave earlier
and he was [ah] mind you he was like the guy in charge that day there was only three of us [eh] on shift when supposedly it was supposed to be five people on shift
ya ya so I I was co in charge [lah] on that day
no it's not a big deal [lah] that job it's just
someone to be (um)
someone to be who's who will answer to the client [lah]
ya so like
he told me at the night before like at nine o'clock mind you and shift was going to start at three he's like [eh] just I think (err)
I may need to leave tomorrow morning after six
ya so we have this deliverable that we have to send at six
ya so after that he said he might need to go I was like okay [lah] why then he said [oh] because I have this teeth
problem like I have been having toothaches for the past few weeks and then tomorrow was the like the next day was the only day that he could get
(err) <malay>apa tu</malay> (err)
appointment
as soon as possible
because that night I think it was hurting very bad [lah]
no no no like probably at eight o'clock probably
<malay>nak kena siap apa nak kena siap abeh nak kena pakai baju</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>abeh nak mandi semua</malay>
I don't know [lah] I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt [lah]
obviously like
you could be lying also but why would you lie about that you know what I mean
especially on a day where there's two people
ya is it doesn't make sense
so anyway he told me that [lah] he told me <malay>macam</malay>
(err) okay I need to leave then he said he told our boss also our project manager then okay [lah] I told him okay [lah] then go ahead [lah] you I will handle even though it's jaden's first day [ah] then that was jaden's first day also
so I had to train him
I had to retrain him because he's he's been
on or like our other client
(um)
!wah! damn long
like for six months
so he has been out of the loop for very long
he's not [lah] but like
he's practically new because
the last time he was on this shift
was months ago
like
almost I'd say a year ago
to be safe ya
(um) we are now separated into clients ya
[oh] cannot say
yes
anyway
stop
ya you don't need to know [lah]
ya the other one is ya
so ya that was quite interesting day [lah] because like I think I was just spewing a lot of information on jaden and jaden was like [eh] wait wait wait [ah] !walao! !walao!
ya he was so lost and I felt so bad because like
I only
ya I tell you later the other thing later
so <malay>macam</malay> he was damn lost [ah]
no I tell you another thing later like so I just saw my schedule
like you know I've been on this
three shift for six months plus now right
so like
and it's because of my korean classes also so like
I told my boss [lah] I feel bad
(um) hogging this
seat in shift in this particular shift because the other juniors also need to try
this shift right so
(err) I requested to go to
so she said
okay she will see so I had this conversation with her in like september so I was supposed to move to
[eh] no in october sorry I was supposed to move to the this shift in
in what day [ah]
in october
suddenly I saw I was still in the shift one
so I was like what the hell
ya I asked her already she can take me out
into either a new shift or she tell me in advance that she's going to put me at a different timing but I will just ask for off on the days that I'm working [lah]
ya [eh] on the days that I have ya on the days that I have my
my language classes then <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>tak cakap apa-apa</malay> never say anything so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay
then like I and
I only found out about this
movement to this confirmed movement to because I had to ask
ya usually she will like
you're supposed to go to people when you're telling them like
[oh] you're changing shift
like it's normal to not go to people but this is because I'm changing clients
ya so it's a bit <malay>macam</malay> give me some heads up (uh)
ya so it's quite
ya but now I'm going to change to shift
in december
same timing
three to twelve
bit earlier because my current shift is three thirty to twelve [eh] twelve thirty
then now it's like (err) three to twelve
I can but it's because of my timing for work
[eh] for my classes
ya
no no it's already been destroyed before
ya I did that
ya
ya [lor] so like
I'm quite excited because it's a new I've been on this shift forever right you know
I'm so tired
(uh) yes but then
(um) I'd have to
retake like I'd have to rearrange my korean classes (uh)
ya but I'm going on this shift for like three months
maybe three months around there
three months first
ya it feels like that correct
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
ya
and then like very hard to meet people hard to meet you meet friends meet family make plans I think it's the making plans that is a bit difficult (uh)
like ya I cannot force people like I cannot <malay>paksa orang</malay> to
<malay>datang</malay> and you know
to
like follow my schedule because it's crazy for them to follow my schedule
and then <malay>macam</malay> it makes more sense for me to follow other people's schedule but like
I'm
my sleep is deprived
I have to really plan <malay>macam</malay> straight away after finish
twelve thirty
I have to sleep
and then I have to wake up at like I don't know six seven
<malay>pastu keluar lepak</malay> and then go straight to work <malay>atau</malay> sleep a bit more and
go to work ya
ya correct correct so it's especially with my korean class it's even more harder because
it's in the afternoon then if I have to meet people at night then I can't sleep
know what I mean
ya
(mm)
<malay>tidur</malay> [jer] <malay>kerja</malay>
ya and because my shift <malay>pukul berapa pukul tiga</malay>
<malay>tiga pagi sampai dua belas setengah petang</malay>
it's like
if I were to sleep in [kan] that's literally my whole work day
gone so it doesn't feel like an off
ya
sleep ya
ya
correct correct
don't know I don't know I think
high chance right that I will be on this shift
for six months
maybe because this
this shift right
only one malay can take
this particular shift for
so like
a lot of the malays in my
my my team [lah] at least they are
they are not big fans of
(um)
this client
this !huh!
no <malay>takde takde takde</malay>
no they <malay>dorang</malay> big fans of <malay>macam</malay> the workflow and all that even though it's a bit more chill (uh) actually
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>maksud dia</malay>
ya around different workflows different deliverables everything [ah] because it's a totally <malay>lain punya</malay> client ya
yes but
you can always learn (uh) you know what I mean
and it's a job [ah] you are getting paid
<malay>tiga ribu</malay>
plus
ya
you just learn [ah] you know what I mean
this job my job also you don't even need
a
particular degree I have one of my colleagues whose who took chemistry
ya she she took chemistry in the <malay>pastu</malay> (um)
she applied
for this job because this job entry level is it's good for entry level people (uh) because it's it's you learn on the job kind of thing you know as long as you're good with computers
and excel you're good to
you're you're good
ya
yup
yes correct
ya
ya
so I mean it's good [lah] I I think I've been stuck on the previous shift for too long
that I've been very complacent <malay>macam</malay> I've
like this current shift that I'm on [lah] I've been too complacent
not complacent <malay>macam terlalu banyak</malay>
<malay>terlalu banyak</malay>
<malay>terlalu banyak</malay>
(um)
<malay>apa tu terlalu banyak</malay>
I don't know I I just I
what's the word [ah] complacent (uh) when like
when you let things pass
easily now
like last time I used to ya last time I used to be like super like !whoa! like you know about this like
(err) [oh] <malay>yang ni jangan nak kena betul-betul tengok</malay> the the deadline and all that
like [oh] because we have to we have to make like
a clock report right every ten
you have to send a report so around nine to ten or eight to ten we start proofreading
<malay>abeh kita</malay> proofreading we put everything [ah] like whether the date is correct
the
sentence structure the
numbering for the all that all that answers [lah]
the numbering and all that and the [oh] categorisation and all that is <malay>betul</malay>
so
then now I'm just like
skimming through instead of going job by job one which is bad but like
like I one time I caught myself doing it (uh)
like last month or [what] then I realised [oh] shit this is very bad I need to
be more serious of my job
or ask for a change in environment
ya
ya then people you work with also makes a big difference [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> whether they
whether they <malay>apa tu</malay>
whether they
can work with you or not [ah] like listen to what you say
or like they are able to
volunteer because <malay>kita punya kerja</malay> [kan] <malay>banyak ada nak kena</malay> #chope#
reserve
<malay>macam</malay> you must #chope# certain deliverables [lah]
ya
correct so like every morning okay I tell you the process of <malay>macam mana kita kerja</malay>
okay so <malay>pukul tiga setengah</malay> I <malay>bangun</malay>
three fifty I wait for papers to come in so papers come in three fifty
I've to download the papers from this (um)
this file
then like
(um) from this file three fifty I download already then we have to read the papers at
we have to read and like make headlines and
like type out the headlines [lah] like what are the headlines for today so
let's say <malay>pukul lima</malay> we have to send headlines
so one person will have to say what send headlines
yes five in the morning
send headlines [lah] ya
so have to send headlines so someone has to say like [oh] I'm going to send headlines today
so if you happen to be partnering or like in a team with someone who
doesn't speak up or doesn't like who has no initiative it's going to be very tiring if you keep
because I'm the kind of person <malay>yang</malay> I cannot <malay>tunggu</malay> for people
people if they want it they have to say it
first if not I will take it and I will get it done
ya like
correct
correct so you
me if I were to ask things like that right it will make it me seem like
I'm not a I'm not
like I'm not a <malay>apa tu</malay>
like I cannot be I cannot make decision like I'm indecisive
I just want people to I have to be like smart about it (uh) when I when I think that people are not doing it
ya
ya and
ya
(mm)
often time
but now
that was last time (uh) remember I told you there was like one time in between july <malay>sampai</malay>
september <malay>ke</malay> august
there was like this team that
full of seniors very jaded seniors
<malay>pastu</malay>
jaded ya
just jaded like <malay>macam</malay>
they don't like their new people in this shift
or like their newer people in this shift
so <malay>dorang macam lepas tangan cepat-cepat</malay>
(mm)
!wow!
they're going to they're going to cringe at this
so bad
so bad so bad
ya so
no jaden is actually my senior
he came in before me
yes
okay now they'll think that you're trying to be smart they know this
they know this
you're not trying to break the form or anything they know this
<malay>orang ketiga</malay> [lah]
no
<malay>apa benda</malay> home wrecker
<malay>kayu tiga</malay>
I don't know
I think so
I'm so sorry for the person who has to transcribe this
do you need us to read a dictionary we can do that too
no I think <malay>dorang nak</malay> more natural conversation so that
this whatever can pick up
I know [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> we are talking directly to you know now we have to like just have a conversation between ourselves so that you know in the future we are actually helping
people
(mm)
(mmhmm)
it's too loud
okay
okay
(mm)
ya [lah]
no but I just
I don't know <malay>takut</malay> it's not because I don't they also never say like what
kind of conversation
[oh] so they have to do it again and it's so hard to find a quiet place
everything is so noisy we live we live in a you know what I mean and we're our neighbours are so close to each other literally there's a guy
banging on the damn
dustbin door ringing through like all the blocks
ya
right but it's okay [lah] I think it is their job [lah]
[a'ah] [lah]

(uh) can watch online if you want [eh] you want to watch today
ya
why
(mm)
I still haven't watch actually that's why I
ya
but ya I think that [one] will be quite interesting
because it's ya
don't know [ah] movies are
just tough stuff [ah] because
there's a lot of planning to put into it if we want to start our own
film
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
will you do it on your own or will you like go out to like (uh) <malay>tanya</malay> or ask anyone I don't know
ask someone who's in the scene that you know of do you know do you have any contacts
!wah!
okay okay I also had scriptwriting
I had a filmmaking class also
okay
then it will be just this (uh) you know like like the the when you do all the project by yourself then it's just all your name right
done by whatever written by no then like it's just two of us and then plus the actors or whatever then it will just be the same thing directed by written by produced by #blah# #blah# #blah#
(mm)
(mm)
you
I want to see a produced by me
but like you see [ah]
these kind of things need money
I know but where you how are you going to live
[ah] okay
we're not going to put our whole heart and soul into it right
yes yes
ya but like not all your and not all your money
but this kind of thing definitely need <malay>macam</malay> to set up to set aside like at least
two months for filming at most if you're lucky
[ah] but it's there's people to I mean there's people and actors to deal with also [what]
and we have our jobs also if we have a job when you have a job
ya that's if I can off day that
meets with your off day
know what I mean
ya
but okay [lah] not that bad
#han# [orh]
why
okay
okay
(mm)
(mm) understand
okay
I don't know how to check how do I check
haven't played a lot of games yet but I will try it later I have a lot of time
(mm) I try play on Borderland [lor]
I I haven't bought yet
expensive no
[oh] yes you're right you're right <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> #betuls# okay [lah]
(mm)
I kind of blew my money on Shopee for the eleven eleven sale
but I bought really stupid things [eh] like (ugh)
things for speedy for my cat
(um)
I bought camera through you right I bought webcam for my
computer but it doesn't even work now later you need to check whether it works
because like
what else [ah]
[oh] I bought masks
okay later I will show you I bought the remember I told you I bought (um)
to for the #mugen# train I bought the demon slayer masks
cute <malay>gila</malay> [oh] my god it's very cute
ya ya I <malay>dah</malay> wash <malay>lagi</malay> I <malay>dah basuh</malay>
I <malay>dah kering</malay>
I <malay>dah apa lagi</malay> (err) vocabulary <malay>boleh kasi dorang</malay>
I <malay>kering</malay> I <malay>dah</malay> squeeze dry
I <malay>dah</malay> compress <malay>tu</malay> [jer]
ya I <malay>dah</malay> I've done quite a lot of things [lah]
ya so as in it's drying now <malay>tengah nak kering</malay> I'll show you later you can try if you want to take home
<malay>bawa balik</malay> [ah] <malay>mana satu yang</malay> you <malay>nak</malay>
I I I I I only want one which is the
#nezuko# [one]
I ordered four
because it all looks so pretty <malay>semua lawa gila</malay>
of course [lah] but like I have other masks too
ya but I I'm a bit scared of being like
to be seen as a weeb
<malay>dia macam</malay> those who know will know right
and then people think like (err) this girl anyhow only does she even know the movie <malay>dia tahu ke tak tahu ni dia main pakai</malay> [jer]
(mmhmm)
ya
#adli's# watching
ya
ya we've talked about this before <malay>berbual</malay>
does it feel ya does it feel like it cheapens the
movie now that everybody watches it or do you think it's doesn't matter
like you know how when it when it's <malay>macam</malay> when it's very a niche group of people watching a niche show right it makes the show more special
I feel like when everybody watches it
dia <malay>macam</malay> it feels a bit cheaper because like
[oh] now they are going more mainstream <malay>lebih</malay> mainstream
the special
ya
ya
(uh huh)
correct they need to
ya
accessible
ya
it becomes very accessible (uh) that's the thing
but I mean it comes with goods also [ah] because like
thankfully
due to the
popularity of <malay>macam</malay> demon slayer for example
or #haikyu# maybe it's gotten quite popular
not as popular of course [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> ya so like
it's easier for me to buy merch let's say merchandise <malay>nak beli nak beli apa lagi</malay>
<malay>nak beli</malay>
ya <malay>macam</malay> these merchandise <malay>nak beli baju</malay> you know
it's so easy to find
ya [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> if you if it were another show for example <malay>macam</malay> Fruits Basket
<malay>atau</malay> I don't know what's another show I don't hear it (err) hunter by hunter X hunter
quite popular [eh] <malay>macam</malay> you know what I mean
like if if it's a very niche show it's very hard to
appreciate it better with like merchandise or support them more like artist more
which is what's the english name
okay
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm)
ya so that's what I'm talking about [ah]
hard to be a fan when they're not very
well known so <malay>macam</malay> that's why I say there's pros and cons [ah]
ya
(mm)
so like
okay understand
(mmhmm)
okay
[oh]
busy
for korean dramas also
ya
(um) because I don't know [ah] it's different [ah] it's a different
country different things they appreciate I just talked to my
you <malay>tahu</malay> [kan] I <malay>ada</malay> classmate <malay>jepun</malay> in my korean class
so <malay>dia</malay>
(err)
she's very she's very quiet [lah] but
she doesn't follow a lot of
korean
things even though she's taking korean class
so <malay>macam</malay> most of us <malay>kita ambil sebab kita</malay> either
interested in the culture
we watch K dramas
<malay>kita tengok dengar lagu</malay>
<malay>kita tengok cerita</malay> K drama <malay>dengar lagu</malay> K-pop or like you know just korean artist
so like
this lady she doesn't
indulge in these things
like she's just taking it for fun (uh)
so I asked her like [oh] how about ya so I asked her <malay>macam</malay>
how about japanese content how are they like then she's [oh] she doesn't actually watch a lot
and she say <malay>macam</malay>
there are not
as many well known
(um)
japanese dramas
if you think about it
kind of true or J or J like
ya japanese drama like those with episodes
you don't do you know any
ya exactly
apart from anime like
<malay>macam</malay> real people
ya real dramas
(um)
it's not as popular [lah] in japan
so ya that's why she said she didn't then I ask her what she does in her free time so [oh] I just do writing because she does (err) makeup
like (uh) she studies
(err) what's that called cosmetics I think
(um) I'd say she's in her mid thirties
ya her husband is in singapore [lah] that's why she's here also
ya
I don't think so I think they're both japanese
probably ya but then she said she's going back to japan next year
for new year's
so she might not join the class but anyway I asked her like how's
the life in japan <malay>macam</malay> how was her school life or like at least [lah]
then she said [oh] she actually like didn't like school a lot because
she just didn't like it [lah] then she said she prefer being out
no I don't think maybe I don't know
ya
but she's she
she's quite nice [lah] then she shared with me like about her school life (uh) how <malay>dia kerja</malay> part time
(um) like during high school and all that
quite interesting [ah] it's it's I love this class because <malay>macam</malay>
I get to talk to so many people from other countries in my class there's a taiwanese girl
there's a indonesian lady there's a vietnamese girl
and like the eleven year old <malay>punya</malay> remember I <malay>berbual pasal</malay>
cute <malay>gila</malay>
and this japanese lady so like half the class is
international so like
I'm I'm closer to the indonesian [one] [lah] because
ya because like I like I talk to her about <malay>macam</malay> my trip to #yogyakarta# the like last year
and then she would share with me about her time also <malay>macam</malay> in #jakarta# and how <malay>dia rindu</malay> [lah] <malay>rindu gila dengan</malay> #jakarta# <malay>tapi</malay> she she feels like
she will definitely stay in singapore for a bit because this place <malay>paling</malay>
<malay>paling selamat</malay>
for in terms of safety
general safety and for COVID [ah]
<malay>tak kat</malay> #yishun# not at #yishun#
#jakarta#
ya [lah]
but she used to live in #yoyga# also #yogyakarta#
and then (um) <malay>dia macam</malay> I don't know
very nice [ah] they all very nice people I'm just very glad
I I guess
I don't know they would look as I don't know
I mean different people are different [lah] what are you talking about
speedy ya so
it was quite fun
taking korean I think I can understand a lot
of like whether I watch
I can try
I can try but just know you can check what okay okay
<malay>boleh boleh</malay>
[ah] I have a lot I have a lot teed up in my
(uh huh)
okay
okay give me give me like give me two more months
because it takes me one month to finish one term
so like give me two more months maybe I'll be more pro
<malay>sampai tahap maksima</malay>
kidding
<malay>apa</malay>
(um)
I mean we are learning from a child's
perspective but we are adults so we understand it better right
so (um) I'm I'm guessing if I were to go korea now I can speak basic
korean like I can ask where the toilet is I can ask how much and understand how much a certain item is I just it'll take me awhile to (um) calculate [lah] because <malay>dorang punya</malay> numbering is very <malay>susah gila</malay> it's like
<malay>dorang</malay> count [kan] <malay>dorang punya</malay> currency <malay>besar gila</malay> [kan]
in the thousands so like
correct hyperinflation like of indonesia <malay>sama juga</malay>
so <malay>nak kena</malay> you must really calculate [lah]
when your and you must because numbers are different also they have korean numericals
they have chinese numericals
ya correct
yes so like (um)
<malay>banyak fikir</malay> [ah] I feel like it's easier for me to write then it is for me to speak which is not a good thing because you're supposed to be able to speak better because you're learning a language
to speak that language you know what I'm saying
correct I mean that should be the case for some kids [what]
definitely you'd know how to speak more than
exactly but <malay>macam</malay>
ya you'd know this right since it's your ya so
it's just
ya I just have to keep practising but I have no one to practise with at work also no one wants to <malay>layan</malay> my korean I feel like I'm such a
whatever a korean weeb is
when I try to speak korean
ya #koreaboo#
but it's because I want to improve but I just bought key caps
from Shopee
ya I'll show you later it's very very nice bro
<malay>lawa gila</malay> it's very it's super damn it's super nice
!wah! I don't know how to explain it's like it shines through and it's very clear because I was a bit
suspicious
when I saw ya when I saw online [lah] because you know how you don't trust anything online ya that's why
you can't really trust a lot of things online so
(um) I used to because it was cheap but it was originally about twenty plus dollars
no it was eighteen and then during eleven eleven it was
fifteen dollars like !wow! and like it's hundred and four [eh]
and and I'm quite lucky that it
and it (um)
that it fits
ya
it's they say it's for Logitech [eh]
say it's for Logitech

do you think that our generation our malay language is
sort of like bad
because I think our generation don't use malay words
very often
at home okay for myself [lah] in my opinion at home also
I mean I think for my
household situation I speak to my mum to all my family members in english
so <malay>macam</malay> when I want to
speak
<malay>bahasa melayu</malay>
<malay>aku macam</malay> like I find it
not say difficult but <malay>macam</malay> awkward
(mm) <malay>kaku</malay>
<malay>kau</malay>
(mm)
<malay>sekarang mana ada kampung sangat</malay>
no okay do you even okay maybe you do [lah] but do you think that majority of the population know their neighbours do you think that they like everyone would actually
talk to their neighbours nowadays
<malay>jap aku nak</malay> check <malay>dulu</malay>
<malay>yang selalu tegur</malay>
is <malay>kau atau dia orang</malay>
(mm) <malay>gitu</malay>
not really like what if they close their doors
and windows

[ah]
<malay>apa ni tadi aku macam</malay> sort of
[dah] off topic so <malay>aku macam nak tanya kau</malay>
<malay>sebab aku</malay> thought of it [lah] the thought just came into my head

(uh) wonder woman two
it's coming out soon
[eh] wonder woman [seh]
that's the villain [lah] for this movie
I don't think you need
I don't think you need to be a fan [seh] to watch a movie a movie is a movie just appreciate what has been created it's like it's an art
you have to appreciate what has been given to you
[eh] movie <malay>dia bahasa</malay> english [lah] <malay>apa yang kau tak faham</malay>
<malay>walau kalau pun</malay>
<malay>walaupun kalau pun takpe</malay> [lah] (uh)

<malay>kau dah kenapa</malay>
<malay>ni mesti dah lama sangat tak tengok</malay> movie

<malay>betul</malay> [ah]

<malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) okay [lah] <malay>kalau tengok tak</malay> don't want to watch a movie then we can do other things I'm flexible
(uh) maybe we do something different [lah] you know that they have this like
you know those (uh) escape rooms
but instead of it being like interactive like <malay>kita macam</malay> just solve the mysteries
in the room itself they have this new one
where its virtual reality

!wah! <malay>kau banyak</malay> slang <malay>kau ikut</malay> [eh] <malay>zaman-zaman punya budak</malay>
young at heart <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>tadi</malay> (uh) while I was on the website
I was looking at the furnitures [lah] to like maybe buy I don't know I haven't make any decisions yet
but have you seen the loft bed
the linie loft bed
I mean ya the our website [lah] bedandbasics our company website then after that I was looking at this linie loft bed
and then I mean the price is on the higher end
but the bed looks so good the black one
wasted
<malay>kau asal tiba-tiba tak boleh berbual</malay> english <malay>betul-betul ni</malay>
why
the what
what promotion
how much was the promotion
!huh! spend six hundred wait wait wait wait wait spend six hundred dollars get fifty dollars off you can use on the spot
so that's five hundred fifty [lah]
but okay that doesn't matter [ah]
because I didn't have money back then so
but ya now I have money and I'm looking at the furniture and the furniture looks good the black colour one
like
the the I don't know [lah] maybe it was the picture the the whole aesthetic of it with the and the nift loft bed
ya I'm living for that like
I want that kind of
design now in my room
<malay>aku nak ikut</malay> exactly <malay>aku nak ikut</malay> exactly as the photo
because
I would from the from the plant by the side
I want it there also
I mean the can be different [lah]
because I wanna buy a better brand better quality
then buy like a a sofa bed and then like that will be used as a sofa
to like if <malay>kalau ada</malay> friends over <malay>boleh buat</malay> movie marathon
prism <malay>tu</malay> [eh] that one quite famous [seh]
I mean like not not famous <malay>apa pula aku</malay> famous (um) a lot of people bought from them
ya
I've seen the reviews
and like
on all the
e-commerce or like startups from like bloggers vloggers or whatever
a lot of them give good reviews
and another one was the
[ah] LUMOS aura projector
aura <malay>ke</malay> auro <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> somewhere but the brand name is LUMOS
and then [ah] projector
ya and I but because like I don't know I can't decide whether I wanna buy a or the projector
<malay>kau tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>aku macam</malay> is always difficult to to decide so
I don't know because like there's pros and cons for both
because let's say if I move out with a projector is easier
then with a it's more bulkier but then if I want to play games or anything
like
<malay>kau tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
there's so many things that I <malay>nak beli tapi</malay> there's so little time and there's so little money
like the five <malay>pun baru keluar</malay> then <malay>aku macam</malay> like <malay>nak main</malay> game spiderman
cause ya [lah]
<malay>abeh macam</malay>
[ah] adulting is so hard sometimes you know
ya
so
I don't know
what about you are you not looking to buy any furniture cause <malay>kau pun baru</malay> move [kan] move out to a new environment
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[kan] I also had that concept
<malay>tapi</malay> !hais! is the money [lah]
money is a big factor
can you imagine we find the you know there was this mouse hunt recently
the ten thousand dollars mouse hunt by the squeaky (uh)
<malay>tak dia macam kena jumpa</malay> this coin <malay>abeh</malay> they made the hunt virtual this time because of the pandemic
[ah] the concept is like that you find
the winner who the winner who finds it will get ten thousand dollars
can you imagine the amount of money
that amount of money ten thousand dollars <malay>tu macam-macam</malay> [tau] <malay>kita boleh buat</malay>
<malay>jangan cakap</malay> christmas dinner [lah] staycation [lah] <malay>aku rasa kita seorang boleh beli</malay> each a the loft bed
and then we still have spare
we can (uh) I mean
divide [lah] the money then I would probably wanna buy like a a new laptop
for school
[eh] <malay>kau</malay> speaking of school
<malay>kau dah</malay> holiday [eh]

happy family you mean yes
[oh] I think you will know my answer I will I really am a fan of (uh) you name it anything that is korean-related korean drama especially ya so if you were to ask me it's korean drama it's because of
I would not say I grew up watching it [lah] how how would I explain it <malay>dulu masa sekolah rendah tak tengok</malay> drama korea <malay>macam cuma</malay> drama <malay>melayu macam dekat</malay> channel five I mean I do watch channel eight too sometimes because of my sister
so like I got into korean drama is because of one of my friends (um) she suggested me this [one] at at that point of time of the year [ah] the title was boys over flowers
so I I bet everybody knows this so <malay>masa tu macam</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] boys over
flowers best [tau] <malay>cerita dia</malay> [ah] <malay>cerita dia pasal sekolah perempuan ni perempuan ni dia pergi sekolah kat sekolah orang kaya-kaya</malay> then <malay>nanti dia berkawan empat lelaki ni</malay> then I was like
[oh] okay <malay>mula dengar macam</malay> [oh] okay then when I watched I was like okay it's it's getting more interesting because of the twist and the plots of the story so I'm like I'm so down to it I'm so like and I end up watching the the whole full episode so it was
it brings me back so much [lah] like that was the joy that I found in watching like
I think basically I like korean I korean korean type of drama they have they have lot of genre like romance thriller they even have like [ah]
they I mean they have a lot [lah] but ya I think I'm more to like those kind of like stuff like friends family and such how about you
verbally
[oh] I like
we watch the same thing ya [ah] kitchen nightmares
[oh] those were the days I tell you yes I do watch catfish is I think is the number I don't say it's number one but it was on right at that point of time ya I remember watching catfish I was like it's so interesting like how can that guy that host
found out about okay let's let's [ah] go into this and then you just type your profile and all that stuff then how like !wah! like !wah! you bring me back so much to to the time where ya
naive
(err) how do I say this I'm not the type because I don't usually use those type of apps that people use nowadays to connect to a friend or to find someone I don't dare to use it because I heard a lot of stories sometimes like like you say [lah]
it might be I mean I I'm thankfully enough because I'm not on that side of it I never tried any apps so I never gotten catfish before but I heard stories of
like people using fake profiles <malay>macam dia orang pakai gambar orang lain habis lepas tu gunakan dekat laman sosial macam gitu</malay> then <malay>orang mesti macam</malay> [eh] I want <malay>tinggi</malay> !wah! <malay>cik lawa</malay> [ah] <malay>buat kawan</malay> [ah] [kan]
so I'm like how can they do that like even they even it went viral before on a social media where there's this this person use a influencer
photo to just catfish people on this app so I'm like how can how can people
I mean ya I mean
ya I I got nothing to say about that but you know
talking about kitchen nightmares though it would these kind of shows also make me mad it will make me want to watch it's cause how interesting like gordon ramsay is there to help like no matter how rude or how bad the person is he's like [ah]
<malay>aku dah mesti nak tunggu kau nak bantu kau</malay> I'm here for you like you know
like that that's the that's the thing I like about gordon ramsay he don't care about what other people says but because he's just there to help you he's he's genuine enough to help you so and ya kitchen nightmare also got fun side of the stories also
[oh] ya ya ya
movies
(uh)
[oh] movies would be harry potter yes harry potter is
ya harry potter is the one [lah] I mean I watched
from the season season one to like I think I I I forgot how they got too many but ya their their movie in each and every series is so good I mean ya it's because I think is the connection of
the ending of the story makes you wanna know more usually they end it the movie like you need to wait for the next next movie to to know to find out so that makes me and I mean wizard is like
very unique and interesting [what]
<malay>macam dalam dunia ni itu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> movie [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [kan] based on
non-fiction [what] so it's like <malay>bila ada</malay> movie <malay>macam gini macam</malay> !wah! <malay>macam dia orang pakai macam</malay> magic wand they use like a lot of stuff to to to cast a spell on someone or to fight someone it's like

[oh] okay okay alright alright
yes that is
three hours is because (uh) they add in like musics and a lot of stuff because that is their culture [what] ya when making movies [lah] but this is interesting it's because of the movie it's just clear cut it's just it's very mysterious one thing and it's very unique is because it [ah] it <malay>dia ada macam</malay> crime crime scene <malay>kat dalam tu</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> never seen a movie like that before like usually it's just dancing then you like
how [ah] you know that kind of thing I mean like bollywood movies are all
generally good [what]
!oof! cartoon I can say I watch a lot of cartoons but from what I know from my siblings I love to watch teletubbies I you know I I remember I had

<malay>macam</malay> try new recipe or dishes that we found like other cultures' food like it's so interesting like for me if I could get like any food I crave for I can like okay I wish for this food then it will appear in front of me it'll be great ya I mean like
ya that's just a wish [lah] but ya money and health health of course health is very important for us [lah] as we grow older we need to take care of our well beings and all stuff right and ya that is all [ah] ya [oh] I have another question for you
[ah]
if you have unusual superpower what would it be
(uh) it would be to read people's mind for me to read people's mind <malay>pasal yang</malay>
<malay>kadangkala bila kita nak tahu apa orang tu sedang fikir</malay> [kan] <malay>dia macam dia diam</malay> [jer] <malay>jadi</malay> if
I have that superpower to to know what you're thinking <malay>apa dalam minda dia macam</malay> !wah!
I can maybe like let's say <malay>nak buat kawan kita</malay> because I'm I'm a very shy person to be honest to new people [lah] if you want to make friends
so it's like if I can read people's mind like [oh] okay <malay>dia ni rasa macam gini-gini</malay> maybe I can from there I can start a convo maybe because I know what's going on in their mind [what] so
ya for me it will be (err) read people's mind
I wish it could exist but I mean [ah] you know
[ah] food it's always about food [ah] in the end it's always [ah] it's I don't know maybe food or
I know ya exactly that's the downside of reading people's mind too [lah] what if you found out something that you are not supposed to find out but
I think I mean like that's part of (uh) your life journey right in every journey it's not so perfect I mean <malay>dalam dunia mana ada macam mesti ada</malay> <malay>macam mesti ada macam masalah-masalah yang macam</malay>
<malay>yang kecil-kecil</malay> [lah] you know <malay>tapi mana ada yang macam</malay>
and like <malay>tapi apa-apa pun</malay> in the end it's all you know it's all up to you [lah] actually
alright so how about [ah]
K got another question for you okay (err)
let me I'm still thinking about the question
for you so ya ya [ah] okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
exactly
interesting
(mm) (mm) (mm)
that's true
(mm) I get what you mean
what was [ah] the thing that I wish was free yours was very spot on question is education for me I more to
for me it will be shopping because everyone in this world loves shopping right ya so for me shopping is fun if you get feel like <malay>masuk kedai</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>nak beli baju ni</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>kena bayar tak payah bayar</malay> okay
I mean just <malay>bawa balik</malay> I mean sometimes if it's see something we like
then we're like hesitant I mean <malay>biasa</malay> [lah] sometimes <malay>kita pun macam nak beli ke tak beli</malay> [eh] <malay>nanti guna ke tak tak guna</malay> [eh] <malay>tak guna nanti sayang pula kalau kau tak guna</malay> so
so ya it pays a lot of factors so I believe if we if
it was free like we can shop whatever we want I think we will find enjoy stuff for everyone ya so
(err) [oh] I got this is another interesting and unique question that I found (uh) if humans no longer needed to work to survive what will we think we will do
yes yes this quite interesting
ya I agree I agree with you if me I will think
if we do not longer need to work I think we will be doing gardening
I mean you know garden is I mean to some it'll
be a healing process because like you plant <malay>berkebun</malay> I mean <malay>lepas tu</malay> you <malay>tanam</malay> any <malay>pokok</malay> [ah] any <malay>bunga atau pokok yang yang</malay> favourite [lah] [kan] <malay>tanam</malay> then after that you water it you let it out on the sun and then you like you watch it grow it's like
a very for me it's kind of like a very peaceful (uh) peaceful what do you call [ah] called a procedure you call it that ya I mean like it will be interesting like you can see your neighbours like
<malay>tanam</malay> maybe like you can <malay>tanam</malay> fruits <malay>buah-buahan sayur-sayuran</malay> I got a neighbour [ah] [ah] my neighbour likes to plant [ah]
starfruit
it was so interesting because I never ever saw a starfruit plant before so it's like it's quite big
and then the starfruit was it it came in a it came in in how do I in in a oval shape at first but when you cut it inside it was actually a star shape so it was actually very ya and another I think in common common common areas also <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada macam tanam cili padi habis</malay> you <malay>nak cili padi daun kari daun kari</malay> for me it's very common <malay>daun kari</malay> then <malay>ada apa lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>macam bunga-bunga</malay>
<malay>bunga</malay> rose I don't know if it's common <malay>bunga</malay> rose ya common like ya that is like cause my neighbours they love gardening so whenever I walk past their house there'll be a lot like
like a lot sorts of like plants and you know like ya
[ah] ya yes
hobbies actually !wah! hobbies I would say there's a lot I mean I think one thing for me is baking you know me [lah]
I I love to bake I think I I I since I started baking when I was I think I tried to venture out during secondary school may actually
<malay>tak suka masuk dapur sebenarnya masak pun nak masuk dapur tu pun macam susah sikit tapi</malay> I think when it comes to baking is a bit different for me any pastry is more to a sweeter side where cook is more to savoury savoury type of (uh) food [what]
so it's like when comes to ya I think my hobby is baking for now [lah] I try I like to venture out on a lot of stuff like I mean I vacant I used to like bake like [ah] I think one of my successful bake was a oreo cheesecake that was
for me that was a biggest step cause usually I will like to take the simpler step like maybe like meringue cookies <malay>macam kuih-kuih kuih-kuih tu macam bahan-bahan semua senang-senang macam kalau nak buat kek</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kena bahan ini</malay> [lah] <malay>bahan itu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi nak dia punya</malay> process the process of making it is is very hard [what] so for me ya my hobby will be baking how about you what what what what what would be your hobby or what would you like love to do
I mean it depends on the person practising (uh)
I mean for me it's best to practise first than you I mean some people like to gamble they just like [ah]
why not you just try you know believe in yourself and just go for it you know but for me I'm I'm the type where practise first you know just to be safe than you know just to gamble like you know do do whatever whatever
stuff [lah] ya
of course yes
[ah] favourite <malay>lagu</malay> genre genre genre <malay>macam</malay> genre <malay>melayu ke</malay> genre [ah] <malay>sembarang-sembarang apa-apa</malay> genre <malay>kalau apa-apa</malay> genre

love talking about love I suddenly so shy no [lah] kidding love at first sight
(um)
I'm not sure about love at first sight but I believe that we are all
there's there's what do they call that destiny is it
destiny to like it's already like there's a
partner for us [lah] but love at first sight
I think I'm on a neutral side I mean love on first sight <malay>macam macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>kita jumpa orang tu</malay> first time then <malay>kejar</malay> I'm not <malay>terus tersentuh hati terus jatuh cinta</malay> I mean I
I kind of I mean not I kind of I used to I used to to you know look look at like [eh] [oh] my god like maybe I'm interested but then it'll
make me think back like will I really interested to like I mean get to know that person really like
their lifestyle and all that all the stuff ya for me like
I'm on a neutral side basically (uh) ya very interesting how how what what do you think
[oh] I understand K K
[oh] my god okay
[ah] <malay>faham faham</malay> ya ya <malay>ada orang pun fikir</malay>
ya for me also you will only like that person only after you get to know him like I mean maybe some people <malay>mesti tengok macam</malay> !wah! <malay>dia ni kacak</malay> [ah] <malay>dia ni macam</malay> handsome [jer] [ah] <malay>tapi tu</malay> [ah] <malay>fikir-fikir balik</malay> [ah] <malay>kita</malay> like would you really
fall in love with that person just because of your first sight or the looks or
or another thing ya
so I got [ah] another question for you
(uh) [oh] you talk (err) [oh] okay K if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
!alamak! okay that that will be hard for me also because I enjoy drinking <malay>teh</malay> O <malay>ais limau dengan</malay> syrup syrup <malay>limau</malay> ya !alamak! if if me K if if I were to choose between syrup <malay>limau dengan teh</malay> O ice I will <malay>pilih teh</malay> O ice
I mean syrup syrup <malay>manis</malay> I mean I <malay>teh pun manis</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>tapi teh lagi macam lagi</malay> like it give you a stronger taste like give you more depth of tasting !wah!
yes correct
I would [oh] wait this is very interesting because I got a few countries I would like to stay in mind but if our !alamak! this also very hard [lah] I mean
I am basically like I said I love korea so much down to the culture but if I were to really pick like
if I were to stay there for the rest of my life I think it would be australia or new zealand
I mean I think mostly australia australian and new zealand
because of many singaporeans too live there currently right so it's like
closer to home also so australia is also quite an interesting [ah] country to I'll say I'll say australia ya it's very quite a interesting country to live in I think I look as if as australia is very kind of a chill country I would say
for my heard experience from my from my friend who went there so far heard stories about that [ah] from my friend went to australia it was ya I'll pick australia I think is is I think is like well ya everybody will pick australia I I don't know I don't know ya but how about you
ya that's the thing I I'm torn between sorry I'm I torn I'm torn between korea and australia but I mean I think I'm more scared to live in korea because of their culture is much
more I mean how do how do I say this mean they I mean
it's hard [lah] to say but then I mean every country all have different different type of culture and different type of (err)
different type !aiya! basically it's culture [lah] but ya sorry what were you saying
of course definitely
that's the ya that's the number one thing for for us
[oh] no (uh huh)
it's just <malay>mi apa</malay> noodle
ya ya correct correct ya ya
[oh] no okay
[oh]
ya of course me too I won't I I I I myself also don't like to stay in one place I would like to know like safe is singapore [lah] like you wanna go to this one place like what this place only [what] what for we will go like [eh] let's go eat here ya then after this we go eat there then we go to another place another place
ya talking about talking about just now you said about tourists right did you mention tourist ya [ah] what would the place that you usually love to go in singapore in singapore any places
[oh] of course of course
<malay>kalau</malay> sound (uh)
any sound [eh]
actually any sound <malay>tu</malay> I <malay>takde</malay> idea <malay>tapi macam</malay> if you were to ask me if [ah] I <malay>tak pergi</malay> where what is [ah] my favourite place to go I will pick (uh)
gardens by the bay it's also nature it's the same I think it's particularly because I like to watch flowers <malay>bunga</malay> basically like I said [lah] <malay>bunga cantik</malay> like I really really really
you know my favourite [ah] <malay>bunga matahari bunga matahari</malay> is my <malay>kesukaan bunga matahari tu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> every time I <malay>tengok mesti tersenyum pasal dia</malay>
the colour <malay>dia</malay> colour <malay>macam cerah</malay> [kan] colour <malay>kuning</malay> [kan] <malay>dia macam</malay> what [ah] it it will lift up your mood
when you see sunflower for me [lah] for me I don't know about other people when I see sunflower it lifted up my mood cause of the colour then it just make you smile some more it can grow so big and tall in other countries I'm like how can they grow up so big like that I wish I could grow that tall and big sunflower in our country I mean but ya ya but the sad thing is that I'm not good at
gardening or planting I mean once I plant something it will take a few months then after that
after that it will you know I I ya
yes
if me I know I I I I heard stories that [ah] rose rose is hard
to to plant and to <malay>jaga macam kalau tanam tanam bunga</malay> rose <malay>tu tapi jaga bunga tu nak kena</malay> [ah] <malay>selalu</malay>
<malay>kasi dia air</malay> so gotta give it enough sunlight if if not it will it will not grow grow well [lah] from what I know rose but if I would would want to plant it's like I say
<malay>bunga matahari</malay> I <malay>nak tanam pokok bunga matahari</malay> ya
like I say if I can plant as tall as big as what other countries do why not
of course of course it give you [ah] much more
it will give you an eye-opener basically and it it give you more energy when looking at
plants and looking at [ah] flowers bloom <malay>bunga-bunga pokok-pokok macam kalau kita bersenam di pagi-pagi dengan matahari boleh nampak</malay> [eh]
<malay>pokok</malay> [eh] <malay>bunga cantiknya</malay>
[ah] it will make us <malay>macam</malay> it will make
make us forget about the busy life in this [ah] singapore you know singapore is now so busy so when you look at plants or like any flowers
it will take you away from [ah] from that side that busy [lah] that side ya
ya so it's really nice to hear all of these [lah] I also really agree with you on all this cause it's

#satay# soup base
!huh! really
[oh]
[oh]
<malay>hari ini</malay> cheat day
K ya so <malay>macam mana</malay>
[oh]
<malay>bukan</malay> B B nine [eh]
<malay>bukan</malay> [eh]
[oh]
(um) K <malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
(err)
<malay>ke cakap pasal</malay> shares [lah]
so
so far
I <malay>nak</malay> try [lah] <malay>baru</malay> try try I <malay>nak</malay> try stock then I <malay>macam rasa-rasanya</malay> tesla will grow [lah] in the future
<malay>sebab</malay> ya because a lot of countries are <malay>macam</malay> adopting (err) are banning petrol vehicles by
in the future
so
by investing in <malay>macam</malay> electric car company <malay>ini</malay> [kan] all those clean energy ones
(uh)
the shares would probably go up [lah] in the future like maybe not now maybe <malay>dalam lima sepuluh tahun</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> bitcoin <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] bitcoin <malay>dulu</malay> also low [kan] but after four years then suddenly spiked up so ya I feel like for now ya maybe I'm gonna try with
electric cars
so hopefully that one day I will reap the benefits [lah]
so what do you think how about you
!huh! serious
ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah]
I'm not really sure also but islamic finance <malay>tapi</malay> I think like <malay>macam</malay> those stocks <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> permissible <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>yang tak</malay> go against the basic purpose [ah] <malay>macam</malay> those thoughts <malay>yang</malay> deal with (um) vices then
alcohol
you know all those <malay>macam</malay> clearly <malay>apa ni</malay>
things that
are not allowed [lah] in islam so I think in generally if you know the company
and like you know what they do right you will have an idea on
what they invest in so if like if they are halal then you just go ahead [lah] with it
that's my <malay>pandangan</malay> [lah] on this
okay for me [eh] I think <malay>kita kena macam</malay>
diversify [lah] our portfolio you cannot keep all your eggs in one basket you have to like <malay>macam</malay>
segregate your assets [lah] so I think one good (err) platform to that we can use is
(uh) #wahed# invest so this is a <malay>macam</malay>
I as far as I know this is the
only <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>syariah</malay> compliant <malay>punya</malay> stocks trading platform [lah] so which means you just put in your money then automatically then you select what kind of risk profile you want
so based on that right they will just take your money invest in the different kinds of
(uh)
commodities [ah] <malay>macam</malay> cash <malay>ke</malay> gold
<malay>ambil</malay> bonds and all these are like certified to be <malay>syariah</malay> compliant so I think you will feel safe
investing in <malay>macam</malay> these kind of companies
(um) and ya and this kind of company is like you don't need
you don't have to put in effort [lah] you just <malay>letak</malay> your money then you just
(uh) forget about it
so I think that better than like putting in a bank
and
and nothing will grow in a bank
right
[oh] okay so like
based on my experience <malay>dia punya</malay> fees is
(err) ten
ten singapore dollars I think for per transaction which means if you want to find your account right if the bank will deduct ten dollars as a service charge [lah] then when you want to withdraw also they will they will charge you ten dollars so this is one one of the downside [lah] of of using
#wahed# invest
<malay>tapi</malay> like maybe this is one
(um)
how to say [eh]

okay dear (um)
just a question
we planned about going to korea south korea
<malay>kenapa</malay> you <malay>nak pergi sana</malay>
<malay>kenapa</malay> you think that it's a <malay>macam</malay>
we should go there [lah] you know
aside from that
you sure you like korean food [ah]
I thought you don't
you don't like
(um)
<malay>macam</malay> fishy fishy stuff you know
but the problem is weather what if
it's cold
it's cold and you (uh) <malay>tak tahan sejuk</malay> you know <malay>tak tahan sejuk</malay>
so you are you are telling me that <malay>kita kena</malay> shop before <malay>kita pergi</malay> korea
no
that's not what you're supposed to do
but the question is when no [lah] kidding
let let let's leave that to later [lah] but
(um)
I the the thing is that I want to go there <malay>sebab</malay> I've been there
so
it's a place whereby I <malay>rasa macam</malay>
<malay>tempat ini bagus untuk bawa</malay> partner [ah] you know
to have
a good time with my partner
so
ya that's why I wanna go there
I don't know <malay>kalau</malay> if there
they have #mukshidonna# there <malay>tapi</malay>
better than nothing right
but in korea
there will be a lots of walking
I'm not sure if you can <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>tahan</malay>
there's not much escalator there's a lot of stairs
excuse me all the more we shouldn't bring a lot of stuff
<malay>sebab kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> shopping <malay>dekat sana</malay>
<malay>bawa benda</malay> bring light pack light [lah] you know
confirm <malay>berat</malay>
that's why you should pack light
so that you can shop more
that question
we shall leave it to our budget
no [lah]
since it's far right there's no point going for like like you know like a short trip
might as well like take a one week
trip you know since we are already there
or maybe more than one week
seven
I don't know what is that
but then again right
I wanna go there when it's winter <malay>tapi</malay>
I'm just afraid that <malay>kalau</malay>
you know [lah] <malay>kita tak tahan sejuk</malay>
I <malay>tak tahan</malay> but you know
I <malay>tak</malay> I I <malay>tak pernah</malay> experience snow you know so
what more if it's the first time with you
I get to experience snow
my first snowfall for my honeymoon
<malay>mana balik</malay> singapore <malay>demam</malay> if <malay>kalau dekat sana dah sejuk</malay> obviously you
(uh) you fall sick there
<malay>tak</malay> #shiok#
<malay>tak</malay> #shiok# [lah] <malay>siapa nak nak nak</malay> fall sick in on holiday [seh]
but I think you'll like it there [lah] <malay>sebab apa</malay> [eh]
there's a lot first thing there's a lot of cosmetics
and it's cheap
no it's not plastic surgery cosmetics like makeup stuff
but then I thought I I'm not sure that you <malay>pakai</malay> [lah] brand brand <malay>itu semua sebab</malay>
korean brand [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> etude you know etude house
there's a lot of hand cream <malay>dengan</malay> face masks very cheap there
ya socks
face mask hand cream
innisfree
!huh! no no such thing
but <malay>banyak banyak</malay>
all those korean brands [ah] like etude house innisfree
<malay>dekat sana lebih murah</malay> [lah] compared to you <malay>sini</malay> [ah]
!ee! no
we concentrate on korea <malay>dulu [ah] apa cakap</malay> australia
that one might be after korea [lah]
because if I want to go australia I want it to be like <malay>macam</malay>
a road trip [tau] you know like <malay>macam</malay> you know melbourne [eh] like from sydney we drive down to other places
I don't know [ah]
like like
it's not
it's not really like from sydney to melbourne it's like let's say you drop in sydney then you go drive somewhere
or maybe from melbourne then you go drive somewhere
<malay>macam</malay> we get to see the <malay>apa itu</malay>
scenery twelve apostle's <malay>yang dia orang tengok itu semua</malay>
melbourne right [ah]
<malay>tapi masalahnya</malay>
I'm not a good driver
I can drive
I can drive but I cannot
stay woke
they want to go but
that will take
another five years I <malay>rasa sebab nak kira-kira</malay> plan <malay>dua tahun</malay>
I <malay>dengar</malay> husband <malay>dia tengah ambil</malay>
so okay [lah]
I'm a trusted driver
I'm a safety driver you know I check my blindspot
I do my safety checks you know that kind of thing
provided provided if <malay>dia masih</malay> single [lah] <malay>kalau dia nak kahwin</malay> might
then cannot [lah]
by then <malay>dah ada anak [kan]</malay>
see how [lah] but but
see how [lah]
<malay>mana [lah] tahu dah kahwin longgar sikit</malay>
again [ah] this thing
what nonsense

excuse me
if it's just friend friend okay so don't touch more on personal side
okay let's go back to korea where we should be talking
ya but

it is much more (err) not it's much more harder like much more thinking to do because it's a lot more roles like among us is
(err) you just come
[eh] <malay>macam</malay> they are like only one impostor right one role [ah] it's the impostor and crewmate two two roles [ah] basically but this town of #salem# is <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada cakap</malay> jailer <malay>ada cakap</malay> (um)
mayor [lah] then like also same same thing like
the the impostor so called impostor but in town of #salem# the impostor is called the mafias and the mafias (err) the mafias can only attack at night so in the morning people will <malay>boleh macam berbual</malay>

ya
but I hope like
ya for me [lah] but I hope like they do something like [eh] okay [lah] eight people not bad [lah]
but then I just I just hope you know the
the number of cases <malay>tak naik</malay>
<malay>kalau naik yang sekarang pun dah</malay> restrict <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>macam dah tiada orang kena</malay> [kan]
(uh huh) (err)
<malay>bagus</malay> [lah] [sia] <malay>bagus</malay> [ah]
!wah! <malay>kita ada dua minit lagi</malay> !whoa! <malay>macam nak</malay> end podcast <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>macam mana orang</malay> end podcast <malay>ada</malay> intro music [eh]
[eh] <malay>tak boleh gitu kau fikir apa senang sangat kerja ni</malay>
bro countdown <malay>tu apa</malay> new years new year <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] [eh]
yo but actually !duh! !wah! okay so you got anything you want to say before we end sir darwin
there are like thirty seconds left
[ah] hopefully [ah] #inshaallah# #amin#
okay [lah] but it's
and I mean it is has been like
it's been very natural right we do it as natural as we can right
it's not it's not scripted or anything for real though it's just
<malay>kita orang berbulal</malay> [jer] like relax relax [jer] [eh]

[ah] alright okay so
<malay>semalam aku</malay> try <malay>main</malay> twenty then (uh) it's not as easy and seamless as I thought it would be [sia]
you know how we started on sixteen
then after that
[ah] it was very
simple the flow was simple and everything right
starting then you straightaway <malay>cam dia kasi kau</malay> options <malay>nak buat macam mana abeh nak kena buat tu nak kena buat ni</malay> so everything was <malay>macam</malay> flow after flow after flow after flow okay
<malay>semalam aku</malay> try <malay>main</malay> it's not like that [sia]
so [ah] <malay>apa tu kau dah</malay> create everything <malay>semua</malay> once <malay>kau dah</malay> start the game yet and everything and whatnot [kan]
so they will bring you through a phase where you have to go for a club interview
okay
and then there are more trainings and delegations of jobs that you have to do
so (uh)
<malay>apa tu</malay> positional positional training tactics [kan] they give you multiples multiple <malay>apa tu</malay>
set of tactics to use and #gegenpress# #tiki-taka# all all pre-default
okay but then
tactic <malay>kau pilih sendiri</malay>
so formation <malay>apa kau nak pakai kau pilih sendiri</malay>
(mm) so there's more tactical freedom [lah] in that sense
no that that is still [lah] <malay>macam</malay> they give you pre-default (uh)
pre-default four four two four two three four five one whatever [lah] so there's a lot of different different different types of tactics to choose and play with but then [ah]
<malay>apa</malay> style <malay>kau nak main</malay> in that game for your players to play [kan]
can depend [lah] so let's say this game <malay>kau main</malay> #tiki-taka# four three one
four two three one
then the next game <malay>kau nak main</malay> #gegenpress# four two three one <malay>pun boleh</malay>
so there is no restrictions on that however
[kan]
(uh)
<malay>yang</malay> #gegenpress# #tiki-taka# is a style of player formation is formation so these two must interlink <malay>kalau</malay> these two <malay>tak</malay> interlink
<malay>kau nya</malay> formation <malay>tak leh</malay> work
(mm)
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi kalau kau buat gitu</malay>
it also depends on <malay>kau punya</malay> team <malay>punya apa tu</malay> familiarity of the tactics [ah]
<malay>ada ada</malay> [ah]
(mm)
yes
!wah! <malay>itu aku belum</malay> check [sia] actually
but <malay>yang</malay> what I do check is there are multiple new per player roles in that sense [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] there's this [one] player <malay>dia punya</malay> role is a central midfielder
but is your central midfielder place like could deep deep lying box to box everything [kan] this guy is more for box to box player but he move towards the wings
and not towards the front or the end or the goal
[ah]
so
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay> their own behaviour in the games [lah] how they will react in the game [ah]
I have yet to check spanish league
but then most of the minor minor leagues [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I see I go to the austrian league <malay>ke</malay> I go to the
belgian I think belgian league don't have then (err)
all those minor minor small small leagues [lah]
I haven't check got I haven't really properly explored the game [lah] yesterday [lah] I mean
<malay>aku balik</malay> [jer] <malay>dah pukul satu pagi abeh aku main sampai pukul tiga pagi aku dah mampus</malay>
I tried a few clubs [ah] yesterday like (err) #dortmund#
then I switch over to (uh) chelsea then I switch over again to #zagreb# then switch over now I'm back at #dortmund#
cause you know
players and formation wise is really very very different from what we are used to [lah]
was four years [orh]
that's four years difference you know
in the span of <malay>apa tak boleh jadi macam-macam</malay> [sia] <malay>dorang</malay> improve
[siol]
<malay>dah empat tahun</malay> [sia]
<malay>kalau tak salah dah lima tahun</malay> [siol]
sixteen will be come out fifteen [pe] [ah]
<malay>tu kau masih</malay> poly so <malay>bila kau masih</malay> poly [kan] (uh)
<malay>tu kau</malay> year three <malay>aku</malay> year one so that means ya it's been five years [ah]
(uh)
by right they should be launching in september october [lah] but cause of the COVID nineteen situation
clubs are still going on there are transfers and whatnots so (err)
it will be quite late [lah] I mean for now <malay>kalau kau pergi</malay> download epic games it should be free [pe]
twenty is free on epic games
it's not a trial it's a full game for free
[ah] so if you don't want to wait for twenty one then just download for twenty first [ah]
at the end of day it's free [pe] if you don't like it you can just go and spend money and buy the twenty one [pe]
<malay>aku dah cakap dengan kau dia</malay> free
<malay>aku tak</malay> check
cause <malay>aku tahu</malay>
<malay>aku nya</malay> laptop <malay>yang</malay> I buy is meant for gaming
okay so then
Acer
Acer nitro five
NVIDIA <malay>ada ada</malay>
<malay>semua ada</malay> [ah] all settle already
but should be <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] cause on my old laptop <malay>yang aku nya</malay> graphic card is based on intel's graphic card [tau]
it's a inbuilt graphic card that
cannot do anything <malay>punya</malay>
still can be able to run sixteen so I feel like it should be fine [ah]
there there might be but but I don't think cause the simulation games do not run
highly on graphic I mean you know <malay>nya</malay> graphic <malay>macam mana</malay> [kan]
<malay>kau tahu dia nya muka kau nya</malay> avatar <malay>nya muka dah macam</malay>
[ah] then after that your players <malay>pun lari dia pun macam</malay> you you know [lah] the graphic is
<malay>macam mana</malay> [kan] so
I don't think there'll be much of a issue when it comes to graphic cards and and whatnot [lah] cause graphic is very very minimal
cause most of the game comprises of their data so what's more important in this case is (uh) <malay>kau nak kena ada banyak</malay> data <malay>untuk kau nya</malay> computer [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> computer <malay>kau tak ada</malay> data then
<malay>macam tak ada</malay> space for you to put all your memory and whatnot then <malay>tu yang</malay> problem [ah] but
if <malay>kalau</malay> computer <malay>kau aku rasa ada</malay> memory then
should be no issue [ah]
it's quite big [ah]
okay
<malay>macam</malay> slack <malay>sana sini</malay> in <malay>bola aku tahu</malay> but I
<malay>itu aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] how it will turn out [lah] but then
you can try at least [ah] maybe when you play the game then <malay>cara</malay> player <malay>dia jalan semua</malay> will be a bit
lag <malay>sana sini</malay> but on top of that
I think should be no issue already [lah] cause most of the player both of the game is data to data data to data
<malay>tu</malay> touch
no cause
I
how I see if what you say is true touch is for
not here not there <malay>punya</malay> type of products [kan] then I would see why phone will not be able to <malay>tahan</malay> by itself [lah] cause (uh) it's
very very detailed
it's there is too much detail in one team <malay>abeh kau tahu dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>kau main</malay> [kan] is just
okay player <malay>kau gini</malay> backroom <malay>kau</malay> happy <malay>dah sudah</malay>
settle <malay>sekarang dah tak</malay> [siol]
<malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] that player <malay>ada ada</malay> core player core group core social group social group A social group B social group C outliers
outliers
<malay>macam</malay> this type this player as a outlier play the backroom
so means he doesn't mix with any of the social groups so he feel left out
so you have to push him into the social league [ah] into social group <malay>kalau tak</malay> you don't kick him out so that he will not cause distress in the backroom
[ah]
so they add a psychological concept to the game [tau]
so then your core players [kan] the core backroom where it comprises of most of your senior players
your highly influential players and everything [kan]
these people can shape your entire backroom just just like that
so if this player not happy with you they cause ruckus
<malay>habis</malay> [ah] backroom <malay>kau terus habis</malay> [ah]
they influence influence influence influence <malay>terus habis semua tak suka kau abeh kau kena buang</malay>
[ah]
so it's
a more psychological concept in that game [ah]
no cause
okay you see [eh] it doesn't mean that influential person in one club is an influential person in another club
cause your influential players is players that been there the longest [tau]
so that means <malay>dia dia kirakan macam</malay> the senior of the group [tau]
okay so then <malay>kalau kau</malay> bring in a fresh new guy let's say (uh) you bring another senior player from this team <malay>masuk</malay> your team [eh]
<malay>takde gunanya</malay> cause
<malay>kau</malay> senior <malay>kat sana tapi kau masuk tempat ni kau</malay> junior <malay>juga apa</malay>
[ah]
[ah] then from there he'll become a senior influential member
it's like my #dortmund# case is
#hummels# was from #bayern# [pe]
then but before that he was from #dortmund# so <malay>bila dia balik</malay> #dortmund# straightaway <malay>dia masuk balik</malay> as a influential player
a senior in the sense <malay>tapi kalau</malay> let's say <malay>kau bawa</malay> (uh) young players like #mbappe# over to a newer club obviously he doesn't fit there [pe]
[ah] so no matter how good he is he still get outlier <malay>macam aku punya</malay> #dortmund# <malay>sekarang</malay> #sancho# is an outlier
cause one thing is
he's a foreigner
ya so he's the only english playing the entire team
so <malay>macam aku campak kau kat tempat lain pun kalau kau sorang melayu kat sana kau pun macam</malay>
it's like me when I was in the navy <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] you'll feel complete outlied cause
you cannot fit into any social group that easily
cause of the language barriers and whatnot
(mm)
(mmhmm)
he will
it depends on how well he adapt into their club [lah]
cause <malay>kau tahu</malay> players [kan] <malay>dorang ada dia punya</malay> own friends <malay>ke apa benda ke</malay> so then they have their own players that they are closed with <malay>macam kawan gitu</malay> [kan] so then <malay>kalau</malay> maybe
you bring him to a new club <malay>yang</malay> (uh)
doesn't have his friends he cannot be influential player there cause he still new [pe] even though he's old
but then <malay>kalau kau ada</malay> player <malay>macam dia suka</malay> let's say he favours (uh) I will give you buckley [lah]
okay <malay>kau</malay> bring him to the club buckley <malay>ada</malay> then maybe from there he mix with buckley he joins the social group <malay>yang penting</malay> is they join the social group
in a sense [lah] cause it will affect your dressing room <malay>nya</malay> happiness [ah]
so <malay>kalau</malay> dressing room <malay>kau tak</malay> happy they don't go out they don't have the motivation to play
then after that you cannot win games no matter how good your tactic is
your tactic may beat #barcelona# five NIL and everything but then if your players are not cohesive enough as a unit you cannot go and play apa
I mean that's what happened during #barcelona# eight two defeat to #bayern# #munich#
the dressing room wasn't cohesive enough
there's a lot of fighting in between
so your dressing room <malay>nya</malay> happiness actually
creates a huge factor in
your performance as a team [lah]
(mm)
yes it's only free up to twenty fourth of september <malay>tak salah aku</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
no no no no no no
once <malay>kau</malay> free install it's free forever it's like (uh) playstation Xbox membership
<malay>kau</malay> download the games for free you put you already collected the game already you put inside your library <malay>kau</malay> uninstall <malay>kau</malay> install <malay>balik pun</malay> the game is still be free
cause you already technically purchase for it already
(mm)
but then let's say you have (uh) twenty on your steam account okay
your twenty steam or your steam can be
crossover to your steam (uh) epic games account
you can you can try [ah] I mean the downloads speed may be quite slow [lah] cause
it's quite a big game [lah] but I connected straight to my LAN cable so it was quite fast for me [lah]
it's not your laptop <malay>nya</malay> LAN cable [pe] it's <malay>kau punya</malay> router <malay>nya</malay> cable [pe]
[ah] seriously
<malay>merepek</malay> [pe]
computer <malay>kau berapa lama</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
[oh] K K K K
okay [ah] then those things do not need high internet speed everything
[ah] then I don't think that [one] can run [lah]
no Zoom lag it's not cause of <malay>kau punya itu</malay> Zoom will lag only cause of <malay>kau punya</malay> connection
[ah]
laptop <malay>kau kau dah kau pernah bersihkan tak</malay>
internal cleaning [tau]
cause <malay>kadang-kadang kalau</malay> laptop <malay>kau</malay> is dusty or whatnot right it will affect the performance
I <malay>tak</malay> I mean
there's a few things that affect your your computer speed [lah] so dust is one thing
and then after that (uh) the make and model if it's outdated then
<malay>susah</malay> [lah] [sia] <malay>kau nak tu</malay> it'll be damn slow [ah]
I have no idea about sixty thirty gig
just be prepared for the worst [lah] I mean
that game is very intensive [sia] data <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> on <malay>tiga</malay> league [eh] <malay>aku</malay> port <malay>aku buka empat</malay> league four players per league [eh] <malay>aku nya</malay> computer speed [jer] <malay>dia punya</malay> processor speed [kan] for the whole for the whole game <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>dah</malay> four star
<malay>empat</malay> league [jer] [tau]
so it's very
it's quite intensive [lah] [ah] [ha]
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau kau nak malam kau nak jumpa boleh jumpa</malay> [ah] <malay>malam aku tak kesah</malay>
<malay>aku balik</malay> [jer] <malay>terus aku boleh jumpa kau</malay> [ah]
<malay>abeh kau fikir aku</malay> familiar [ah] <malay>kirakan aku pun baru ambil</malay> download [jer] <malay>semalam</malay>
[eh] [eh]
ya I downloaded it yesterday okay <malay>aku tak</malay> I never touch the app
<malay>aku tu dah jumpa kau</malay> [pe]
correct <malay>aku</malay> download <malay>aku jumpa kau</malay> after <malay>aku kita berbual semua</malay> and everything <malay>aku balik dah pukul satu pagi</malay>
<malay>aku buka tu</malay> computer <malay>aku tukar</malay> cup <malay>sana sini tukar tukar tukar aku tidur pukul tiga pagi</malay>
<malay>main apa</malay>
ya in a sense [ah]
[oh] okay
look the thing is I only found out about the social group thing today
so before I met you I was I was looking through the game again [lah] to familiarise myself with what the hell is going on [kan] so
there is that thing [lah] I just found out about it today only another new feature of their tab [kan] <malay>yang</malay> came out
in this version was the medical centre
[ah] so you can jump into the medical centre to see your injured players
I don't know why they think that would be a good addition to your
no <malay>kau</malay> maybe let's say (uh) okay cause <malay>kau tahu</malay> you can remove there is a filter in your first few squad [pe] so <malay>kau boleh</malay> remove filter [ah] hide injured players
hide players to icloud so then you go to medical centre you can see which players injured then can see how long they injured for
then maybe there is
interactions and whatnot [lah] I haven't really jump into medical centre yet [lah] you can explore it later [ah]
<malay>merepek</malay> [sia] <malay>kau</malay>
technically you are <malay>apa</malay> [kan] <malay>bodoh</malay>
[ah] <malay>tu kau nak</malay>
I mean honestly if we've bought the game during circuit breaker [eh] !whoa! that would be damn good
[oh] you just press play play play play for ages [siol]
[oh] ya there is a singapore league inside [ah] ya
[eh] <malay>kau tahu kau fikir dorang tinggal kat</malay> singapore [pe]
[ah] you
I mean this is a precedented situation [pe]
<malay>dulu kau boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>tak ada</malay> coronavirus you can just go around and [ah] <malay>beli beli beli beli abeh sekarang dah gitu semua dah balik</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> stuck [lah] unless they didn't go home they stay in your country [ah]
[ah] then <malay>gitu</malay> maybe (uh)
<malay>kau ada</malay> chance [ah] to play and whatnot [lah] but if
they do go home
and the game realised that actually they went off for holiday and they cannot come back due to borders being closed
then there's an issue you have to settle [lah] I mean [ah] like like there's one club
in twenty you can try to manage bolton wanderers
lead one club
okay the issue with that club is they on the verge of bankruptcy
okay so you start the game
without the full squad
okay so most of your players that you start with are semi-pro
so slowly you have to sign them to a professional contract then you have to
bring up players from youth intake everything so you really start the game with
zero money
minimum wages
[eh] <malay>apa tu</malay>
half your squad missing [ah]
[ah]
all the north [ah]
even the north south are not semi-pro [tau]
they are pro you know
maybe if <malay>satu hari</malay> you go lower than that <malay>baru</malay> you come out with a semi-pro club
fall from grace [ah] I mean
financial difficulty
okay
remember the portmore's incident
okay so this is portmore times ten
the portmore they were able to sell off [ah] their assets and everything to keep the club afloat at the same time
they sold off a lot the high players away
and replace them with [ah] cheaper options so there wasn't so bad on their end [lah] cause they got rid of the budget first
but bolton wanderers is when they were relegated with championship they still kept most of the star players okay so then they paid
[ah] crazy wages to keep them alive and then they pay pay pay pay
but then they realised cause of financial difficulty their club will bankrupt they had to deduct the points
so even if you win games your point <malay>kena</malay> deducted
so you end up still going down [pe]
(mm)
it depends [lah] cause
unless you
liquidate the club [ah]
unless you dissolve the club [ah]
<malay>takde</malay>
no
until someone else <malay>macam</malay> you know what
I buy over your club
<malay>atau</malay> they pump <malay>atau</malay> your board just okay you know what screw it I pump in a lot of assets
so once you pump in assets your club
once your club is maintained at the state whereby
you're neither bankrupt you're neither rich you're just in between just nice to survive for the club right
<malay>dah sudah</malay>
whether your club is churning a loss or profit it doesn't matter to them as long as you're financially stable to keep your club afloat
cause as as you go relegated [kan] cause of the financial fair play rules (uh) you're only allowed a certain amount of money in your club
so the more you get relegated after a while you be quite stable cause the amount of money you have is let's say you have two K
okay in order for you to play a premier league you need maybe ten K so
you relegate up cause you only have two K you relegate time <malay>tu</malay> championship which needs five K
so not enough money you relegate down to league one which needs three K not enough money you relegate down to league two then two K two K [pe] just nice your club will stay afloat
but whether your club <malay>kat dalam</malay> [ah] the club <malay>kau ada</malay> loss <malay>ke ada</malay> profit <malay>ke</malay> [ah] there it
<malay>tak kira dah</malay> cause at the end of day
<malay>kalau</malay> player <malay>kau</malay>
okay with small wages
and then play as what they are then there is no issue [ah]
unless
you been relegated down and you job's board to make very very bad decision along the way
then you still keep going down [ah] until you meet a league where
it fits your
financial [ah]
or
the board give up
liquidate the club
<malay>ada</malay>
<malay>ada</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> there are there are a few clubs that did that the most recent [one] was this italian club I forgot what club it was
so they face financial difficulties they were in #serie# [ah]
okay #serie# A
okay so <malay>dah tinggi</malay> [pe] <malay>kirakan</malay> #serie# A [pe] <malay>dia</malay> up there [tau] and then
[ah]
<malay>itu lain</malay> [lah] <malay>itu tak kira</malay> [lah] <malay>bodoh</malay>
[ha]
third corruption
okay so what did club did was [ah] they had to stay afloat cause they do not have enough money to
[ah] to stay afloat [lah] so (uh) what #juventus# did was #juventus# pump in money for them
to keep them afloat but it wasn't enough so
instead of dropping
the board like they just liquidate the club so the club cease to be existed cease to be exist [ah] <malay>terus hilang</malay>
<malay>nari ada</malay> club <malay>esok takde</malay> club [ah] <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
so <malay>terus takde</malay> [ah] then club <malay>dia hilang</malay> that's one thing so (uh) what
the fans did was they gather together a small sum of money each fan <malay>kasi berapa ke</malay>
that you know [lah] some of the fans in this club [kan] quite rich [pe] so <malay>dorang kata</malay> okay you know what <malay>aku suka</malay> club <malay>ni</malay> but then <malay>sekarang hilang sebab apa dorang takde duit</malay> okay [ah] <malay>aku</malay> pump <malay>duit</malay>
so I give you money I give you money I give you money we build a new club from scratch using the same name
[ah] then after that
you start off at the basic league then you climb up again [ah]
then whether your players from your old club want to stay in the new club
that's a whole different thing [ah]
but it is possible [ah] like clubs like
wimbledon wimbledon [ah] that is a new club by itself
cause they split from dons then they come out themselves
so
they are history of clubs going around like this [ah] where they disappeared they dissolve the club and they come out with a new club with the same name
english clubs wise there were a few but they are now in the you know
the bottom bottom leagues [lah] I mean you can go through wikipedia and they will tell you about this [lah]
there are a few clubs with history that
go around like this [ah] (err) one particular example I know is dons [ah]
dons and wimbledon but the one is more of a split decision
so then [ah]
but <malay>ada ada yang lain</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> really <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] [sia] <malay>kau kena kau kena</malay>
<malay>cari sendiri</malay> [ah] <malay>tu aku</malay>
<malay>ada</malay>
<malay>ada ada</malay>
english
<malay>kita ada</malay> [sia] actually
I mean you think about it in singapore we have our S league
okay then we have our delta league
then you have your sunday league A sunday league B sunday league C you have all sort of leagues going on I mean I played in a few leagues myself <malay>apa</malay> so then they have been a lot of leagues where you can actually
climb up the league as you progress along
okay then hopefully you're good enough with financial stability to go into S league but then
<malay>kita mimpi</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [eh]
at the end of day <malay>kita semua</malay> semi-pro [sia]
I mean
if you're passionate about it then okay [pe] <malay>macam</malay>
look look at our situation
you used to [lah] still am [lah] so it's a difference
<malay>dah gemuk cakap</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>dah gemuk tak yah</malay> [lah]
definitely [ah] I mean look at your size
<malay>tu masuk angin bodoh tu bukan banyak makan</malay>
ya [lah] it's cause
no [lah] maybe and also cause
like one point of time where you stop playing for awhile [pe]
so then <malay>macam</malay>
ya [lah] so then you you stop for how long after that
you do not have regular trainings you do not have regular exercise so
everything change [lah]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kau baru nak cakap</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [ah]
<malay>dalam empat tahun</malay> [jer] [lah]
I
<malay>aku dah dalam dua dua tahun juga tak main</malay> [ah] I mean
<malay>sekarang dengan</malay> situation <malay>gini camne aku nak main bola</malay> [sia]
ya like
what my cousin did was during futsal [kan] before the pandemic situation [ah] then they said no slide tackle that was the rule no slide tackle
so what this guy did was <malay>dia tak</malay> slide [ah]
okay so imagine the players charging towards you [eh] running with the ball and everything
I'm in front of you I cannot slide <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> slide tackle <malay>kau</malay> [kan] so <malay>aku baring</malay> on the floor [ah]
<malay>aku baring</malay> [jer]
<malay>terus</malay> bola will hit <malay>badan aku kau</malay> will jump over me <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>aku bangun</malay> I take the ball run away [ah]
idea [kan]
<malay>terus yang dia cakap dengan aku terus aku cam</malay>
<malay>aku tak pernah dengar</malay> [sia] <malay>orang buat gini kau</malay> first time [siol] <malay>abeh macam</malay>
you have to be innovative
you're bending the rules while stay in the rules referee couldn't say anything cause he wasn't sliding
his body was on the floor but he wasn't sliding
so they have to let it go
it was a tackle
<malay>boleh boleh</malay> cause
if
I mean it's been six years right since you last played right so maybe you
how long has it been since you actually watch football
that still two years ago at least [tau]
<malay>takde</malay> time [kan]
no [lah] I mean
[ah] ya [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean
at the end of the day
<malay>memang gitu</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>apa kau nak buat</malay> [kan]
<malay>kerja tetap kerja apa daripada kau takde duit</malay> I mean <malay>tengok kita sekarang</malay>
no [lah] <malay>yang</malay> the <malay>apa tu</malay>
one thing <malay>yang</malay> we need to go and find [kan] is that cup #lee hsien loong# used
[eh] <malay>tu cawan bagus</malay> [siol] <malay>kau minum</malay> [jer] <malay>kau tukar kau boleh berbual</malay> [ah] <malay>bahasa lain</malay> [sia]
<malay>aku minum melayu aku minum cina aku minum</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay>
solid [sia]
<malay>dia boleh</malay> [pe]
<malay>dia boleh</malay>
<malay>dia empat-empat semua boleh</malay>
<malay>kau tak</malay> I mean the the election before the previous election [kan]
I forgot which year that was [lah] (err)
was it two thousand fifteen or two thousand ten [ah] around there [lah]
okay
there was one time where the when
those running for election they have to sit in front of of the camera
and give a speech as to why you should vote their party okay so [ah] every other party [kan]
so for the respective channels like channel five channel eight #suria# and the #vasantham# channel so (uh) every other channel they set down a member of
that race to talk in that language but for the
all across all four channels #lee hsien loong# face
talking all four languages
nobody dubbed over him [ah]
it was a thirty minutes speech
<malay>abeh</malay>
I would listen to <malay>melayu</malay> if I somewhat understood #chim# malay [lah] I mean <malay>kau tengok</malay> when I had to go for the interview in malay [eh] <malay>nanti kena berbual bahasa melayu ye</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> #gabra# [siol]
<malay>aku berbual sana sini abeh aku masukkan ini sini sana sedikit</malay> so it was a very singlish mixed malay type of thing [ah] so it's like how I'm talking to you now okay then [oh] okay sorry <malay>nak kena berbual melayu</malay> so <malay>nari buat gini gini gini abeh apa</malay> word <malay>ni</malay> [eh]
<malay>takpe aku keluarkan</malay> english word [ah] then I speak english again so it's very
ya I mean
no [lah] I mean okay you see [eh] for their generation right
only for okay actually
for our generation [eh] for our generation [ah] at the most [ah]
our first language is usually english
it's not it's no longer our mother tongue it's always it's always english I've seen kids <malay>macam hari tu aku pergi</malay> [ah] <malay>aku gi pancing</malay> [pe] <malay>kat</malay> #changi# [kan]
<malay>aku tengok budak-budak main bila dorang main nak berbual dengan</malay> each other [kan] they don't talk in malay
it was a full out english fest so I was confused whether <malay>itu budak cina ke tu budak melayu</malay> cause <malay>dia berbual</malay> english [kan] <malay>dia nya</malay> english was
quite solid
okay it's
better than our parents [lah] in a in a sense [lah] cause their english was quite fluent so when I look over it's actually malay kids so <malay>aku macam</malay>
okay <malay>ni budak melayu</malay> and then <malay>budak melayu tak boleh berbual melayu</malay>
so these are the kids where
their the english is a very first language mother tongue is their second language for our elders it's the other way
<malay>melayu</malay> is a first language english is their second language
so obviously you only remember your first language [pe] cause that's the first language you're most fluent with
so there's a chance <malay>bila kita dah tua</malay>
<malay>kita tak akan ingat</malay> any other language except for
english [ah] cause
that's the language that we are used to
but then you weren't in malaysia <malay>apa</malay> you were in singapore customs so you wasn't she wasn't in malaysia she was in singapore
from but you said in [ah]
probably [ah] babe
I don't think it's depending on [ah] your mother tongue whether your mother tongue is your core language or english is your core language what I think is the language you're most proficient in [lah]
language that you use most often cause let's say [kan]
for example [lah] <malay>kita tak tahu berbual melayu</malay> at all <malay>dia langsung tak ada melayu</malay> okay <malay>kita cuma boleh berbual</malay> english
[ah] so that means
no
no that means you need when you grow you only remember english [ah] okay I mean
look at the americans they don't have a second language they only have one language [pe] english is their only language so when they grow they only remember english [pe]
so maybe let's say maybe they learn french or what along the way
then they cannot speak their french language cause they only remember that english language as a core subject
this a this is the language they use everyday
you see back in our elders' time the language they use everyday is malay [pe] maybe that <malay>makcik</malay> was <malay>sebab apa tu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia belajar</malay>
english <malay>dengan dari tempat lain</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> forever concentrate <malay>dengan</malay> english
[ah] <malay>abeh kita tak tahu</malay> [pe] anything can happen [kan]
[ah] <malay>ye abeh lepas tu aku dah berbual gitu kau faham tak</malay> [kan] <malay>apa gunanya aku berbual</malay> [kan] <malay>betul tak</malay>
I mean at the end of day also
all these old people <malay>kalau</malay> you actually listen to them talk [kan] some of them do make sense [lah] I mean they can impart some life lessons but other time <malay>merepek</malay> [sia] <malay>dengar</malay>
ya <malay>sudah dah sudah itu itu kau jangan nak bawa balik</malay>
[oh] <malay>dia jiran kau</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tu kau boleh buat</malay> member
<malay>aku nampak pernah nampak dia jalan balik kat sini</malay> so <malay>aku tak tahu dia tinggal mana</malay> okay [lah] <malay>aku dah tahu</malay> [ah]
<malay>mana tahu dia nak buat kawan dengan kau ini budak aku macam kenal</malay> [ah] <malay>hari tu aku nak buat kawan dengan dia</malay> [ah] it can be like that [pe]
he will do [one]
okay but
I mean
all I see <malay>tadi</malay> (err) <malay>bila aku nak naik gi rumah kau ni</malay> [kan] <malay>aku sesat</malay> (uh)
<malay>aku</malay> dah <malay>masuk</malay> lift okay so there was another couple with me in the lift so they press the twelve floor then I down there <malay>aku</malay> stuck <malay>dekat dengan nombor tu aku tengok</malay>
<malay>tingkat mana</malay> [sia] <malay>dia tinggal aku lupa lapan ke sebelas</malay> then in my mind
eleven or eight eleven or eight [ah] screw it I go eight I go eleven first is eleven then I turn if wrong I just go down [pe] it's better than coming up [kan] the stairs [kan] okay eleven let's go
so the lift brought me up to eleven I open the door
[ah] thank god
correct house [eh] <malay>kalau tak malu</malay> [sia] <malay>aku turun lagi pergi tingkat lapan</malay>
<malay>kau tahu</malay> last <malay>aku datang rumah kau bila</malay> [ah]
time <malay>kau</malay> [tau]
time <malay>kau</malay>
time <malay>kau</malay> CISCO <malay>aku tak datang rumah kau</malay> [tau]
<malay>ada sekali kau datang</malay> [eh] no there was one before after <malay>kau</malay> CISCO <malay>juga aku baru masuk</malay> so time <malay>kau datang sebab kita baru keluar makan pastu kau nak</malay>
<malay>balik rumah kau nak</malay> change out to your army uniform and everything to book in so <malay>aku teman kau aku datang rumah</malay>
then <malay>aku lepak-lepak kat</malay> living room <malay>kau</malay>
second time was cause <malay>kita nak keluar makan dengan</malay> parents <malay>aku pastu kau suruh aku datang rumah kau kejap entah buat apa</malay> that was the only two times [ah]
to sit down and properly <malay>lepak dalam rumah kau ni</malay> the last time I did that <malay>kita masih</malay> secondary school
I can tell [lah] I mean
most of time <malay>aku jumpa kau bukan kat rumah</malay> [pe]
is outside of house
ya there is a there's a [ah]
a cycle to work to look forward to [lah] everyday [lah] but now is just
<malay>masih</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay>
<malay>itu</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
I mean
<malay>kau</malay>
<malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] the situation <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] you've been unemployed longer than I have
you know how the you know how the market is now right you know I regret now is I did not extend my service longer
I really regret not extending my service longer even though I had to suffer inside [lah]
mean with the multiple sailings that I have to go for but at least it's there is a routine for me to follow
and at least I get paid
I get good pay you know but
!haiya!
it's a shame [ah]
no cause I know you tried to warn me but as I look forward in the schedule right
the schedule was really
!whoa!
<malay>teruk</malay> [siol]
<malay>macam kau tahu sekarang</malay>
singapore airlines send out their flights to nowhere [kan]
singapore airlines now flights to nowhere <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan]
so <malay>kapal terbang dia keluar</malay>
<malay>pusing pusing pusing pusing pusing pastu balik</malay> [ah] <malay>tak gi mana-mana</malay>
no just to maintain airtime and to <malay>apa tu</malay> free up [ah] parking space
cause <malay>kalau kapal kau kapal terbang kau tak terbang</malay> for very long
it can run down <malay>macam</malay> let's say aircon you don't use your aircon for very long aircon can spoil it's the same thing with aeroplanes [ah]
(mm) so you're burning a lot of fuels fuels cost money
which is why most of their [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay> employees all retrenched
cause
you're dishing out a lot of money but you're not getting back any money
I mean for ship wise it's different [pe] everyday you have to use your vessel
<malay>kau masuk</malay> if you want your things to run you have to on your generators you cannot plug in to a short supply your short supply will not be enough
(mm)
no [ah]
it's still quite low [lah] but it's not
that low also [lah] I mean
<malay>kau tak leh</malay> compare
car oil and (uh) jet fuel jet fuel is bloody expensive
so and they use how much cars use how much
you see that there's a huge difference [ah]
from how many litres to how many of litres [ah] so
<malay>ada beza dia dok tu pasal</malay>
<malay>mahal</malay> that's why they
<malay>terpaksa buang orang sana buang orang sini</malay>
no [lah] that [one]
it really depends on current situation [ah] I mean
as of now damn slow [ah]
to pick up [ah]
honestly this situation is worst when corona [ah] worst than SARS [pe]
so it's
no now cause now is cause of the trade war okay they fighting over the trade war
wants to be a superpower but china is really
rapidly coming up and they cannot stop
and recently recently government
ban the postal service from sending masks to every household in america
so the <malay>apa tu</malay> the postal <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] <malay>aku nak buat</malay> deed good deed so [ah] <malay>aku nak</malay> send out
free masks to every household just for free [ah] <malay>aku</malay> send out to everybody everybody can be safe
and they no no no no no <malay>aku tak</malay> approve <malay>ni tak boleh</malay> masks <malay>tak</malay> work the masks doesn't work so no
and then some more there's this person they came out with a a mask a mask a proper face mask with holes inside <malay>macam</malay> fish nets
<malay>kau tahu</malay> fishing net [kan] <malay>ada lubang lubang tu</malay> [kan] so mask <malay>dia berlubang</malay>
and then <malay>kau pakai</malay> so case <malay>kau masih boleh nampak mulut nampak hidung</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi kau masih pakai</malay> mask
[ah] so then the
this this lady was saying !wah! this a very useful mask still can breathe I can be compliant but not be compliant
they are the first to die they are the first to die hello [ah] [seh] they are first to die
I mean the citizens are doing same thing [lah] so I
[ah] <malay>ye</malay> mask doesn't work but then the first
that but then doctors and nurses all have been using it for damn long cause it doesn't work [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
think logically [lah] I mean the reason what america are thinking like this also cause
the education in the system in the first place isn't good to begin with

yes
(uh)
ya I remember I saw the vinny guy [lah] and I can tell that he is very self-aware that people are talking about him [ah]
so I remember like just looking at him then like I was looking at #shu# then I was like [eh]
there see that guy <malay>macam</malay> that guy is the singapore social guy [kan] then she she was like
maybe we just go closer look [ah] then we we I don't know whether I was being very loud or he's just that attentive to people around him right but he was looking at us
then I was looking at him then I wanted to like (um) you're the shit bag who is having a weird relationship with this russian lady that is telling people how to do burlesque
#shu# #shu# is my (err) my ex-colleague the one that is now working for <malay>berita harian</malay> as the

like articles to write about and it's going to like help her a lot more to (err)
like at least advance [ah] cause she's telling me that like right now she's just taking what people give her and like she
taking scraps [ah] from her colleagues so like quite I forgot about <malay>dia</malay> for a bit
[oh] ya anyway next time <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>kalau dengar</malay> like any like cool people or stories or people to interview [ah] just let me know [ah] then at least she has something to write about
or if you yourself have something nice to talk about and can you know I can set it up you can be famous

but she needs to move out by end of the year I think
[eh] no no she needs to move out by next she needs to
move out by next year june or march
<malay>belum</malay> but she she did tell me <malay>macam</malay>
(err) <malay>dia</malay> no [lah] <malay>dia ada</malay> make like <malay>ada</malay> make video [lah] like when she

ya so then mummy was saying <malay>macam kakak</malay> is
(err) what's the word [ah] (uh)
the what's that <malay>anak mertua yang biadap</malay> I think that was the exact words (err)
or maybe that is a
that is a (mm) adjective to to describe <malay>kakak</malay>
but anyway (err) (um) remember <malay>kakak</malay> I was asking <malay>kakak</malay> when she
going to move and she was telling me that whether to decide whether want to
(err) celebrate <malay>hari raya</malay> in her current house
or celebrate <malay>hari raya</malay> in the next house because
she needs to renovate the house is about two months
I believe it should be may june
late may early june somewhere there
[eh] no it should be may it should be may cause this year's <malay>hari raya</malay> was (err) <malay>dua puluh empat</malay>
I remember the <malay>hari raya</malay> was

after my birthday ya
<malay>dua puluh empat</malay> or <malay>dua puluh enam</malay> I think that was the
that was the official <malay>hari raya punya</malay> date
no [lah] as in just <malay>kakak</malay> was asking me [lah] <malay>macam mana</malay> cause
to be honest she actually very lazy to like
like <malay>kasi orang jalan jalan raya</malay> [lah] to her house
like

I can tell I can tell that you you
!wow! so deep
<malay>sangat</malay> deep
no definitely I'm going to keep you
as far away from #shura# and all my other female friends as possible
(mm) no even if I did right I wouldn't show you
are you sure you're not part of the you're sure you're
sure no one took photos video of you showering
<malay>macam</malay> best <malay>sangat ke</malay>
<malay>bagus sangat ke</malay> [ah] (ugh) it doesn't happen in
(mm) (mm) maybe maybe the
has like more freedom
there's <malay>macam</malay> everybody is more free and liberal in
is the liberal [one] is the consecutive
for right okay I know that <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak masuk kalau</malay> you <malay>nak dapatkan</malay> the hostel room right
you need to be part of their like or some major then they will like let you
my god
[oh] my god reminds me of the remember when (um)
running man was super big and then running man running man
<malay>yang</malay> the korean <malay>punya</malay> show <malay>yang dia orang taruk</malay> the the name behind the back of the chair and then you have to go and like
<malay>kejar</malay> them then after that you have to pull the pull the name off the back
okay so basically this running man right is this like korean show or
where
a bunch of celebrities they get their they have a name tag at the back of their T-shirt so
like other celebrities have to chase them and <malay>cari</malay> I believe they have to pull the name tag off [lah]
so after that (um)
she like it was very popular so I remember me and <malay>kakak</malay> we were saying that
we noticed there was a lot of (err) people
we have a lot of like these young people running around singapore in with like their names on their back of their T-shirt
so you'll see like
#jia hui# #jia xing# eldrick elway like just running around like
in the station in one in one like tribe damn funny
but last time <malay>dia punya zaman</malay> also is you know those like
very baggy like basketball <malay>dengan</malay> football T-shirt
I remember (um)
last time we used to have this (err) music teacher <malay>kat</malay> bowen [ah] his name was (err) mister #jamal#
so mister #jamal# he spent he actually spent a lot of his time right as a
like professional <malay>macam</malay>
#trumpist# I believe that's what they call themselves
like
trumpeter [ah] I have no idea [lah] that trumpet players [ah] like professional trumpet players
so he spent a lot of his time right like like going around the world [lah] like he told us that
(err) he was a very rare commodity
in japan in the early seventies eighties
because (err) back then they they didn't really see like people with darker skin and he was like brown [lah]
he was a he he had brown skin so when he went to japan right they were all like just touching his skin and he was like
<malay>kenapa ni</malay>
then I remember he told us
okay you can say that [ah]
so I remember he was telling us that like
he used to perform in like bass in (err) chicago [lah]
so he would play the trumpet and then his
(um) his
friend would play the piano
so (err) I remember what I heard was that
when he from my senior [lah] who was at that time who's going to graduate already who was about sixteen seventeen sec five
he was telling me that mister #jamal# right when he first came down right to the
to the like band like
like what you call this [ah]
<malay>dia punya</malay> club room he
he was in those like baggy football T-shirts [lah]
so they how that's how everybody realised that
this guy must have some sort of
either he's <malay>kekek</malay> like like wannabe or he really has some sort of affiliation with
(err) the
like the [ah] because he was wearing those
(err)
football jerseys [ah] like those what cowboys [ah] patriots
okay I know that
one thing that's very popular is those like lakers <malay>punya</malay> basketball <malay>punya</malay> like
jersey that is always worn by like
filipino people
true true
it reminds me of #kasanaz# I'm sure you remember #kasanaz#
so #kasanaz's# husband is an engineer and he I believe he's a very successful engineer [ah] to the point that
they live in singapore but by right #kasanaz# doesn't need to work
ya so <malay>macam</malay> the husband must be really making serious money [ah]
#kasanaz# is like apparently like got money kind of like girl [lah] but I believe the husband is those
<malay>macam</malay>
chief engineer or something [ah] like the and he's been in singapore for quite a long time [ah]
like even before they met and got married
yes he is filipino
I've seen him
ya
#kasanaz# knock it down
I really miss all my friends at
did I tell you that #wei xiang# is still working at
and I got so annoyed
ya so I got so annoyed cause I'm just like #wei xiang# first of all right
you and me [ah]
[ah] both you and me right are both like poly graduates you know like
your whatever the score is right
somehow some way right we both probably can go to university [lah]
keep telling me that you don't want to go to uni then you want to work
like for the rest of your life then
<malay>macam</malay> <malay>tak masuk akal</malay> [lah] like
he you're you're very smart you're very smart you're very smart you're bright
and it's not that there's anything wrong with <malay>kerja kerja</malay> [lah] but
is really like quite
not doesn't make sense [lah] since you like you
you're so <malay>macam</malay>
somehow educated [lah] most of these are mostly the people who work there are mostly aunties [ah] who
who like couldn't like if they could they would want to work office jobs [ah]
and if you tell me that
if you tell me that you want to work your way into the (err) the office side right then I think you should there should be a way to get in [lah]
so ya [lor]
I believe he's just a cashier
(mm)
supply chain <malay>abang</malay> a job that is quite a big need in singapore
you know (err) he used to intern for supply chain for
exactly so <malay>macam tak masuk akal</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
first of all you are bright second of all you did pretty good
(err) so first of all you did pretty good
in school and like you were quite interested in it and then you you you intern for not a small company [eh] you intern for like a really
big
(err)
you intern for a really big like like
ya should be okay [lah] no it's not
I believe yes but I don't think you
you can buy because I believe is a blue what do you call it a blue chip [ah]
those <malay>macam</malay> how they rank the
cost everything I don't think is
you can easily buy also [ah]
they might be like you might be you have be invited to buy cause I think
like for example #temasek# right #temasek# holdings singapore
you can buy their bonds and all this but you have to be invited
I believe so that was what my teachers to me so I remember
my finance (err) teacher in school right and in poly right
we know that she's rich right because she told us that she has bonds with #temasek# then we were like bonds [ah]
you know shares right you can buy like hundred [ah]
hundred shares bonds [ah] you have to like buy by the thousands [ah] if I'm not mistaken so <malay>macam</malay> you really is bonds are basically you are funding something
yes so it's really like you need to have money [ah]
ya
but ya [lah] it just doesn't makes sense to me that <malay>dah dah dah belajar susah-susah</malay> then <malay>macam</malay>
you just it is really not nice to see that you are wasting away [lah] but
it's a bit sad [lah] like then your parents how
then I remember when we were in secondary school right his
he got an endowment I believe it's called an endowment plan [lah] the one where you
pay every month a certain amount and then you get a certain cashback at the end of like twenty five years [ah] I have [one] [lah]
but recently is I'm paying with it with my own money [mah] and I believe he's still probably getting his
from his parents [ah] cause how much could you possibly earn from
to be honest
quite sad [lah] quite sad so and then I'm just like
and the way like he lives his lifestyle also
cannot understand
I remember like the he keeps eating at
he keeps buying like a lot of designer goods
he the other day I remember he I think he booked a room at like or what [lah] those hotels to celebrate
his birthday or whatever [lah] so I'm just like
why
I tell you this is this everything went downhill right after he met the that <malay>mamat</malay> the his boyfriend
the I remember it's quite insane [lah] like the his boyfriend used to
use him as some sort of like card like that you know
ya they are gay actually technically but you know that's not the issue [lah]
issue is that
the the issue is that
and did I tell you that he he has a debit card then he gave his boyfriend his nets card
so there will be the boyfriend need money can just take I'm just like what kind of insane
ya
ya it's just that the guy handsome [ah]
I think he I remember he was
so this is quite funny so I remember last time
(err)
#wei xiang# was quite a
like not say an advocate [lah] he was quite a
he was quite against <malay>macam</malay> he liked to look down on a lot of this <malay>macam</malay> people because I remember last time
I asked him can we go and eat at this <malay>macam</malay>
the <malay>halal</malay> version of jack's restaurant [lah] there was one at
this at this
it's the steak [one] I remember the there's a <malay>halal</malay> [one] made by this chef then he had a
restaurant at this then #wei xiang# didn't want to go and eat there
yes
it's not like called a jack's it's a by the way jack's place there it exists (uh) near the library
yes
I believe it is or it's just (err) something like jack's but it's <malay>halal</malay>
ya so he say he didn't want because he just like
you want to eat [meh] with all these like
kids running around then I'm like dude that is so mean it's not like they're going to burst into the restaurant and disturb you you know
no [lah] so like remember he didn't want to eat there
cause he was (uh) didn't want to like be near this like be near students
so then lo and behold his next boyfriend is an student
yup so I remember the (uh) boyfriend was studying [ah] architecture or something [ah]
and then the boyfriend he's (err)
he's got money [lah] he's rich I forgot what the father does [ah]
(err) the father quite strict with the money [ah]
like I remember the father once said that
(err) got one time he slept in and then he on the aircon until like after ten [lah] then the father got so pissed the father said
(err)
since you on the aircon after ten right (err) [ah] your allowance is cut in half
to pay back for the time then the the son in like what the fuck it's like
I'm sleeping
I'm sleeping I I slept in like I don't have the power to like
wake up and off it then I remember like got so pissed off the parents were cause he and the
the father and the mother
(um) divorce so the mother is indonesian chinese
then the mother is back there then he is here [lah] then the father remarried then I think like the father <malay>macam</malay>
I think the father
<malay>dah macam macam pilih kasih a bit [lah] like the father
like care more about his like his like half siblings [ah]
I don't know
I don't know [lah]
no I don't think that that is what happened
but anyway so !wah! talking about how ridiculous this is so I remember
whenever these two idiots right go on holiday right for some weird reason they always go #jakarta# one
second thing right they always go #jakarta# on like
business then I'm just like
you go to on business class right
you should go for long flights because
#jakarta# right to me is two two hour three hour flight is not bad because it's just
you are just crammed right for two hours three hours and most of the time you can be sleeping
I'm like have you ever flew to freaking like
#dubai# or like london or not
that is a six hour crammed flight right where like I was so
so sleep deprived right that I lost my phone that was how bad it was
okay I'm pretty sure I got robbed
but yes
that's besides the point
yup I'm pretty sure I got robbed anyway
like <malay>macam</malay> it doesn't make sense [lah] and then you know what's the worst thing I found out from #wei xiang# #wei xiang# told me that he went there and then he still need to bring
(mm) go and meet the mother
he still need the mother still ask the son for money #wei xiang# give the mother money
yes but you can put a number on stupidity and this is this is this is fifteen out of ten
it's over nine thousand
not all of them [ah] but some of them right really right you know you can't put
you you know words can't describe your your beauty right but numbers can [lah] one out of ten
that is not ethical that is anything but ethical
no [lah] you have to make sure that if you are Instagram model and you are like
showcasing any product you need to make sure that
first of all whatever you showcase is true whatever you say is true whatever benefits you say is true
you don't lead on any of your followers you don't prey on kids
don't be #dee kosh#
don't prey on kids
seriously #dee kosh# is like screwed he is like
screwed I told you right that he did actually go to come towards my friend right with an offer
(err) okay so basically I was having a convo with my friend whose mum is the baker
remember the lemon yogurt loaf
lemon yogurt you <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>tak ingat</malay> [eh]
I did I bought muffins as well and brownies
okay so I remember I was talking to him about
I think about his nephew [lah] his sister gave birth so
he was telling me
no
listen to the story so after that
the I remember he was telling me [eh] #raf# want to want to hear something cool then I say what then he's like call me then I'm like
okay so I called [lah] then he was like [oh] my god do you know who just like
what proposition to me then I'm like who
freaking #dee kosh# then I'm like !huh! what you #dee kosh# wants you to model for him [ah] he's like no #dee kosh# wants to suck my then I'm like
[eh] wait wait wait wait wait [eh] you don't anyhow [hor]
then he show me the like the text [lah] so I was like
you're this guy is insane [eh] you want to like
you want to find these kind of services right
you don't <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam bodoh</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> don't don't <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>pakai</malay> your own freaking like
Instagram account like you first of all right you use another Instagram account
and to be honest
your selling point right should not be
your selling point right should not be the fact that
hi I am #dee kosh# your selling point should be hi I have money
he did both he used both
so basically like he what he does right is that he will always be like [oh] you look hot or whatever want to come with me on my videos or not
that is his first proposition
yes so after that (um)
like then later on he'll be like [oh] like (err)
how about this like spend a night with me like I give you one thousand dollars or two thousand dollars or whatever amount of dollars [lah]
so so <malay>macam</malay> I was telling like him [ah] that
no obviously I don't know #dee kosh# I'm telling my friend that
no so (um) I was telling my friend that in the
in the like gay world right
like this kind of thing is normal [lah] hooking up and everything is normal but
you don't stupid [lah] there are apps and all these [mah]
as in like there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being lesbian
all these kind of thing anything that as long as you
you don't hurt anybody you keep it to yourself don't go and attack all these [lah] cause like
to me right all these
like people taking photos of like guys taking photos of guys showering right that is like you're harming people [mah] like
no one agreed to this [ah] and like you know
you shouldn't be doing this [ah] so this is the
part of like
like you know how people say there's like white privilege
so sometimes people say there is
in a sense right I won't say this is gay privilege but I see that like sometimes people are very
like
they they don't want to <malay>macam</malay> speak out against like gay people because like
they don't want to be seen as homophobic it's the same as
how like people don't want to talk about like how
like sometimes like
women right are actually the ones who victimise people in so called rape cases
like people don't want to <malay>macam</malay> [oh] actually she's a liar and all these ya
it's the same as (uh) you know johnny depp's ex-wife or ex-girlfriend amber something
[a'ah] the one that I believe cut off his finger or something
don't know but I think he cut off his finger or something
or cut his finger or something the one that she's now married to
that Tesla guy right I think
elon musk
ya so as in like
a lot [lah] I tell you right all these <malay>macam</malay> people taking videos of like people and all these
so anyway I guess he's still got support like #dee kosh# is quite stupid [lah] in my mind <malay>macam</malay>
you're famous <malay>kau</malay> famous <malay>macam</malay> like people know people people know your face then
<malay>kau buat macam gini macam</malay> you want to proposition right don't use your own account [lah]
<malay>pakai macam pakai</malay> fake account [lah] <malay>gini pakai</malay> your own account <malay>macam</malay> you're just asking for trouble
you're just asking for <malay>macam</malay> like someone is
and the worst part is right like what the sushi guy said [ah] is like it's okay to
preposition people
preposition people for and using money right is is illegal [lah] you can't like solicit sex for cash [lah] I believe
that is
wrong [lah] like that kind of prostitution thing is wrong [lah] I don't know how how wrong it is [lah] in singapore
but he was propositioning minors you see
then he should need to what's the due (err) not due I don't think I think it's called due diligence to
find out whether the person is of the correct age or not [lah]
because <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know right is not a good enough (um)
answer to to evict you from like (err)
like
a a sentence [ah] it's like that there was this guy who
who didn't know what the heck he was bringing into to singapore to <malay>macam</malay>
to give somebody to pass off something then
someone (err) he actually got caught in the singapore terminal
(err) with drugs [ah] that he was supposed to pass off to somebody
and then he's he did tell the the the judge [lah] he say I didn't know what's inside
these all locked up already I never open it I can't open it also
then the judge says that
just because you don't know what is it right you never think it's suspicious [meh] for
four thousand someone ask you to do a delivery for four thousand dollars
like like so not knowing right is not a good enough <malay>macam</malay>
it's (err) it's not a good enough (err) like what you call it
defence [ah] the guy got the guy got hanged anyway
so same for #dee kosh# [ah] <malay>macam</malay> just because you you
he the guy never say or whatever right [ah]
doesn't like make it right [lah] you should own self <malay>macam</malay>
make the initiative to ask or if the person lied to you right then
then is different if the person lied to you will be like ya ya I'm actually eighteen but he's not
and then
(err) lied to you and you're eighteen and there was no payment involved and then you guys had sexual intercourse then
it's fine [lah] like the person cannot say because the person lied [mah]
and the person tricked you into it but #dee kosh# I think he
fairly knows I'm pretty sure from photos you can kind of tell
that these guys are probably under aged or if they're like
if you've seen like they're if you follow them on Instagram and then you see that [oh] I'm still in poly they still post poly photos
there's a high chance they're not even eighteen yet
cause poly year one poly you're seventeen only [mah]
okay the thing is right empower him right
in the sense that
we we
not me exactly [lah] but like people like
influence [ah]
ya
who
ya you can you ya as long as you
as long as you no it's john lennon
ya so like in a sense that
okay first of all these guys are social media influencers if you want to make it like like more
more specific [lah] social media influences [ah]
to
follow a a type of lifestyle
to buy a certain product mostly is to follow a certain lifestyle [lah]
that's between the followers and them [ah] some people will like [ah] it's the same reason why
you like guitars and I don't understand why and I
I quite like and [ah] you're not that big a fan of it
so
as in I won't say we empower him
in a sense because
what we do is that we we we give him
monetary
like we give him we support him in terms of monetary sense [ah] like you know by by giving like watching his videos and then people go and
like advertise on his channel and all this [lah] but we don't empower him to do the things he do [mah]
if you ask me who empowers him to do the things he do then is things like Instagram [ah] Instagram empowers him [lah] Instagram like
gives him the ability to do all these kind of things [ah]
nicole #choo#
first of all right there is no <malay>budak zaman sekarang</malay> you and me right are difference by five years only
yes
okay first of all right it's not <malay>budak-budak zaman sekarang</malay> there are people your age right
there are people your age who do it also you are just one of those people who are not in the trend
you're retard
anyway ya that's besides the point so like
it's just the way the world is [ah] the world evolves in this way [lah] so this is why I always find that
people who always complain right about all these and all these right have to understand that
everything happens right as is is everything is acquisition [lah] everything like happens because something happens [mah]
so like it's just evolution [lah] like something !ee! the previous generation must have done right has created this [lah]
so
like I remember I was watching the documentary about paris hilton
then paris hilton says that she is people say that she was the first influencer
and her responses her response to that was
I regret it [lah] I feel like I created monsters
which is true [lah] I remember she was the first
real socialite [lah] because before kardashian there was her [what]
she was the she was the real like
she her her her parents are freaking rich
her her grand daddy great grandfather is like rich [eh] like really really rich they got a lot of like money
and like she was literally a socialite [ah] she's like those
rothschild
like what
what rothschild what those other like (err) rockefeller and those <malay>macam</malay>
legendary families [ah] like how many legendary families are there left in this world
rockefeller rothschild hilton
(um)
lauder the the family that still owns the that owns the Estee Lauder <malay>punya</malay> line the lauder family
(uh) can't really think of any other people like right now [lah] but
and all of course all your shakes [ah]
all your shakes <malay>macam</malay>
how do I put it [lah] like she is
influencer game thing I think there's nothing
there's nothing wrong with it [lah] it's just it's just
who are who are we right sometimes [ah] to tell people like what they're doing is wrong [lah] if if
if
there is no
like nothing really wrong about it [lah] like to be honest
don't there isn't there guitar influencers also I'm pretty sure there's guitar influencers people that
you know that if they were to review this guitar right that like tomorrow right there will be at least fifty people wanting to buy it
or place an order
so ya so <malay>macam</malay>
it's just the content
that you you don't like which is like everybody's taste [lah] I personally don't like any of these people [lah] like to me my
I'm a foodie so <malay>macam</malay>
I will always be like if there was a foodie influencer will be like [oh] there's this thing that just opened nearby in singapore like pancakes or whatever then I'll be like no [lah] I mean if I'm
(err) I'll go down to town and buy it [lah] if I think that the price is worth or anything but not a big fan of like all these
what challenges [lah] what I put inside my bag [lah] my house
tour [lah] how much money is in my bank [lah] my mother underwear what colour [lah]
you know what this reminds me okay no no no <malay>ingat tak</malay> mummy [kan] <malay>kata macam</malay> she said that
the I think <malay>wak</malay> #nia# right was just posting so much about her life on the like
WhatsApp group chat so mummy was saying <malay>macam</malay> [sia] annoying [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>kenapa nak buat macam gini</malay>
like there's no need for you to advertise your life so don't you think like
in a sense right is this isn't a phenomenon that just occurred you know this
trend right exist in people right throughout the ages
people who
(mm) people <malay>yang yang nak</malay> attention [lah] <malay>yang yang yang gila gila</malay> attention so much [ah] that's what mum was saying <malay>macam</malay>
people <malay>yang like you know <malay>macam</malay>
!huh! they <malay>gila</malay> [kan] <malay>lelaki</malay> no <malay>macam</malay> they crazy for attention [lah] like they they
they're bored they have nothing better to do they just want
to some people they just want to really they just want to share their
their lives [lah] they just really want to share with people and some people might be
very interested like
I would say that if I have a interest in (err)
in a certain like celebrity or something like
would I be interested in
I I would be quite interested in like what is <malay>macam</malay> joe rogan's <malay>punya</malay> like
life [eh] when he on a day that he has fights
that he has fights to <malay>macam</malay> to announce [ah] like
what does he do like what is there <malay>macam</malay> preps that he have to do does he actually have to like research on
the fighters and stuff like that
or he calls or like you know like what is it that day in the life of like
(err)
an person or something like this kind of thing wouldn't you want to know
like what is the what is the prep like for a person before he goes on a mission
how do you how do you
measure productive right
in in in in in like in accordance to
like how useful it is [ah] it's content
I have no idea I've never I've never watched his videos
they have the power of
humour humour and story telling [ah]
no [lah] the target market is people from like
twelve to eighteen

if we could eat one food for the rest of our life
what would it be
(hmm)
<malay>sama</malay> [lah] I also
because <malay>bila</malay> food
food [eh]
but nugget <malay>pun</malay> chicken [what]
<malay>bodoh</malay>
(hmm)
if it's one <malay>lauk</malay> for the rest of my life
<malay>apa sambal goreng pengantin</malay> with <malay>ketupat</malay> or with <malay>nasi</malay>
or <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> with <malay>bergedil</malay> and <malay>nasi</malay>
ya
and sis <malay>tak akan</malay> get bored
ya but I think like the most frequent <malay>makanan yang</malay> I crave for is
<malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> [lah]
like ya because to me like <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> is
life
<malay>sebab</malay> you will have everything there
you got <malay>paru</malay>
you got
<malay>ada</malay> veggie [ah] <malay>ada sambal kacang panjang</malay>
<malay>ada tahu tempeh</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> chicken
<malay>hati ayam pedal</malay> [eh] <malay>hati ayam ke pedal</malay> [eh]
<malay>limpa</malay> [eh]
<malay>bukan</malay> [eh] <malay>hati ayam</malay> [kan]
(hmm)
<malay>lagi-lagi ada udang</malay>
[ah] so <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> is like everything that I like to eat is what <malay>macam satu</malay> dish you <malay>makan dengan bergedil makan dengan nasi sedap</malay> [seh]
but it's considered one [what] <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
(oo) <malay>tak</malay> consider [eh]
why why <malay>macam</malay> why like that
what <malay>tapi itu</malay> [lah] okay [lah] <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>sambal goreng dengan nasi pun jadi</malay> sis
<malay>pulut begitu</malay> [jer]
<malay>pulut tak ada rasa</malay> sis
one food [lah]
<malay>pulut</malay> [lah] but you cannot put other <malay>lauk</malay>
[ah] one food [what] it's like one like it's like one dish
[ah] <malay>tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>pulut</malay>
because <malay>pulut</malay> is one dish
see if talking about dish
then
the <malay>pulut</malay> is not a <malay>makanan</malay> it's not considered [lah]
but food is life
[kan]
because food is life <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>badan kita</malay> sis
(hmm)
(hmm)
seafood
(hmm)
<malay>bodoh</malay> <malay>bodoh</malay>
!huh! what dang
<malay>habis</malay>
<malay>habis</malay> sis <malay>nak makan apa</malay> make up your mind
(oo) if <malay>kita boleh</malay>
choose like <malay>macam</malay>
buffet is consider
like

like if it's a type

like buffet !wow!
sis
!walao!
<malay>teh tarik</malay>

but top-up how many
but <malay>dia tak ada</malay> <malay>dia tak ada</malay> limited hours you <malay>boleh duduk dekat dalam</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> if you go <malay>yang kita pergi dekat</malay> #yishun# <malay>tu yang</malay> <malay>tu</malay> [kan] if lunch is two hours
then mainly like now buffet because of COVID the it's two hours but <malay>yang</malay> <malay>dia</malay> dinner <malay>dia</malay> up to four hours around three and a half hours [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay>
maybe because <malay>dia macam</malay> on the wheel <malay>sebab tu dia boleh duduk dekat situ</malay> like three hours
but sometimes I wonder what like <malay>kenapa</malay> Seoul Garden <malay>tak boleh</malay> extend <malay>dia punya duduk dekat dalam</malay>
but what are the chances that
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] but if like <malay>pun ramai orang masuk apa</malay>
<malay>mana</malay> Seoul Garden Seoul Garden <malay>kita duduk sebelum dua jam</malay> [seh]
or exactly two hours then <malay>kita gerak sebab kita dah terlalu</malay> full
ya
so maybe next time we can try [lah] <malay>duduk dekat dalam</malay>
for like two hours plus and <malay>tengok kena halau ke tak</malay>
what
we should we should <malay>apa</malay> what's the word [ah] bearing up acts what's the word experiment experiment that
experiment experiment that
but the the the the only downside of
<malay>yang</malay> is because <malay>dia tak ada</malay> they should <malay>buat air dalam</malay> jug <malay>taruk dekat situ</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> Seoul Garden so it's easy <malay>pasal kita kalau nak tunggu dia orang</malay> the person <malay>hantar air</malay>
<malay>lambat</malay> [seh]
[ah] <malay>lepas tu nanti orang tu</malay> get irritated

the
(err) <malay>macam</malay> to to the guy <malay>macam</malay> he is in between believing <malay>macam dia dia</malay> as
<malay>dia percaya</malay> in the unseen as part of faith
<malay>tapi</malay>
cannot mix with science [what] so he's trying to do both [tau] to be like <malay>nak</malay> try to make a logic of that
<malay>habis lepas tu</malay>
but <malay>ya</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> logic and faith sometimes but to me to me personally logic and faith have to coexist together
but <malay>benda</malay> unseen <malay>ni</malay>
we cannot <malay>macam</malay>
and it's not of our faith to like <malay>rukun iman</malay> we have to believe in the unseen <malay>sebab tu</malay>

cannot stack that is not <malay>macam tak boleh</malay> is not refundable

<malay>dah</malay> fuse black magic
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
[kan] <malay>tiba</malay>
was it <malay>dia tengah</malay> driving <malay>ke apa</malay> no [eh] no no no no that was in aerostar bay [eh]
[ha] <malay>engkau tak kelakar</malay> [eh] brother
it's not funny [sia] you not funny <malay>lu lu cari pasal sama wa</malay> brother
inviting
okay I have this question [ah] like for example [kan] okay when
in islam we believe right <malay>kalau kita mati</malay> our <malay>roh</malay> does not exist co-exist in this <malay>alam</malay> already so that means we are in another dimension [tau] so our dimension only <malay>macam</malay> co-exist time we sleep <malay>betul tak</malay> so like for example if <malay>kita mati kita nampak orang-orang</malay> people then if
is it the <malay>roh</malay> of the people or is it ghost or like <malay>jin</malay> in a form of people
<malay>jin</malay> or <malay>syaitan</malay> [lah] but is it
a really <malay>roh atau jin</malay> in a form of
[ah] <malay>manusia</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [sia]
for them
but
but I heard like actually burn money and burn hell notes is actually not burn <malay>rumah tu semua</malay> is actually not because of to have <malay>rumah</malay> for them and others right
it's actually to show that [ah] <malay>bila kita mati benda ni kita tak boleh bawa balik tak boleh bawa dengan kita</malay> or something like that
I heard from some people like that
is it
what if like life is like that [ah] then the <malay>miskin</malay> like got <malay>tak ada</malay> chance [seh]
you just imagine [eh] <malay>kalau kita macam</malay> the rich can buy a lot a lot a lot of special things to bribe <malay>orang dekat sana</malay>
I don't know you steal
maybe steal or maybe you kill people because people too demoralise you because you <malay>macam</malay> too depressed and you <malay>tak boleh</malay> happy tu cakap</malay> you it's like a lot story in the news that people <malay>bunuh orang atau bunuh diri sendiri</malay> because too stress and in every vision I believe in every vision <malay>atau</malay>
or maybe it's it's only islam that if if you commit suicide then it's the worse sin <malay>apa</malay>
it's one of the sin it's one of the sin [lah] so that's why I say <malay>macam</malay>
so even if <malay>kita kita tak ada duit pun</malay> it's part of
there's the the the the thing that we can do [lah] <malay>kita bunuh diri kita sendiri</malay>
<malay>kau bunuh</malay> people
okay imagine
okay imagine like husband and wife quarrel no money [what] you you [ah] yo <malay>hutang ni ni ni siapa nak bayar</malay> gets into the head <malay>dia</malay> stress <malay>sangat</malay> then <malay>macam</malay>
socked in the head then <malay>terus ambil lepas tu bunuh ada apa</malay> is it happens
but we don't know [what] like <malay>macam</malay> some people depression <malay>macam</malay> too too depressed they don't cannot find a way to to solve <malay>dia punya</malay> debts then they kill
their child then they kill themselves
then how you you want to answer that it's the same thing [what]
because you you cannot pay off your debts like at your wit's end like you lost hope everything
ya [lah] then like if that's the sin then you take people life you take your own life then if the people want to live how
ya [lah] then how to bribe
ya [lah]
but if you poor who want to bribe for you if you kill the person with you who want to bribe for you
(mm) islam is very fair in that
in the sense that
you are answerable for your own
#allah# is #allah# won't judge you once
<malay>amalan</malay>
a chance to
but sis can you imagine like for us that muslim [eh] let's say [lah] even if you have a chance <malay>syurga</malay> then if you still have to stay in <malay>neraka</malay> like you never know how long you have to stay in <malay>neraka</malay>
and one other story is like <malay>macam</malay> like sometimes it it gets to me <malay>yang macam</malay> [ah]
they say the first thing that will be questioned in <malay>alam kubur</malay> or in the hereafter is <malay>solat</malay> like if
if <malay>kau</malay> the first question like <malay>solat kau tak</malay> pass <malay>yang benda lain semua tak</malay> matter already
then it gets to me [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> then some people say like some <malay>mazhab</malay> say ya you no need to pay <malay>balik yang</malay>
the <malay>solat</malay> that you missed [ah] <malay>solat</malay> just <malay>solat taubat</malay> then you just try not to do it again
but some people some <malay>mazhab</malay> say you have to pay back after every <malay>solat</malay> like slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly
until <malay>kita mampus</malay> then I asked I asked some people [lah] let's say [kan] <malay>macam</malay> how are we going to know how many <malay>solat</malay> that we missed
like I cannot imagine like okay [lah] let's say <malay>kita daripada baligh baligh umur kita sebelas tahun habis</malay> that at times <malay>kita solat juga</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
repay [oh] maybe if <malay>tak</malay>
I I wanted to I wanted to ask [lah] if let's say <malay>kita</malay> because we are busy in this world [kan] kita <malay>kejar kejar kejar kejar</malay> sometimes we don't have time to <malay>qada</malay> [kan] so let's say in a sense that <malay>kalau aku tak solat qada kalau aku ganti dengan solat sunat boleh</malay>
like let's say like <malay>aku</malay> because of the missed prayer [kan]
then sis <malay>taubat</malay> so maybe <malay>macam</malay> sis <malay>susah nak tidur malam</malay> then the only time that I can wake up is <malay>pukul tiga pagi</malay> onwards [ah]
so maybe that's the time that like <malay>macam</malay> can be it <malay>macam</malay> not <malay>ganti</malay> [lah] like can it help or not
[kan] sis <malay>macam takut</malay> [tau] let's say <malay>macam</malay> I want to be prepared <malay>macam</malay> sis want best of both world I want <malay>macam dekat dunia dengan dekat akhirat</malay> so let's say <malay>macam kita dekat dunia macam ini</malay> [jer] <malay>macam macam kita dekat dunia ni dah teruk macam ini macam</malay> we are already bad <malay>dah dah macam ini dah teruk begini</malay>
<malay>kasi air</malay>
[a'ah] [lah]
ya just like the story <malay>yang yang</malay> the <malay>orang yang bunuh yang</malay> the ninety nine killer or something like that or <malay>yang yang bunuh berapa orang tu</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> repent
<malay>dia</malay> repent <malay>dia mati dia masuk syurga</malay> because the person say no he didn't <malay>belum</malay> he haven't [tau] <malay>taubat</malay> because #allah# take his <malay>niat</malay> as <malay>orang tu cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>engkau kena pasal dia yang dia nak bunuh dia punya yang</malay> first the first <malay>pergi dekat</malay> first <malay>ustaz ni</malay> he went there <malay>lepas tu ustaz tu</malay> say [oh] <malay>kau tak akan diampunkan</malay> [lah] <malay>kau dosa kau dah bunuh banyak orang ini semua</malay> something like that [lah] so he out of <malay>geram</malay> he killed the <malay>ustaz</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> kill the <malay>ustaz</malay> you know
so he went to
[ah] then he went to this another <malay>ustaz</malay> then the <malay>ustaz</malay> was saying [oh] [ah] <malay>kalau kau nak berubah</malay> if you want to be in a better place then you have to get out of your surrounding now move to another place <malay>macam tempat yang lebih baik</malay> [lah] so he [ah] <malay>kau pergi dekat sini kau belajar agama</malay> something like that
no this is another <malay>ustaz</malay> so he <malay>dengar apa yang ustaz ni cakap</malay> so he went to the other village or the other place but on the way to other place <malay>dia meninggal mati</malay> so <malay>bila dia mati tu terus masuk syurga</malay>
ya because <malay>niat dia</malay> because <malay>dia belum taubat lagi</malay> [tau] he <malay>tak tahu apa-apa</malay> because he just on his way to <malay>nak taubat</malay> to get out of the place then he already get to <malay>syurga</malay> so the main story is like maybe
maybe it's the <malay>niat</malay> that matters [lah]
<malay>tapi dah maki</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>tapi maki</malay> [jer] [lah]
so if you want to <malay>maki</malay> just <malay>maki</malay> [jer] [lah] [kan]
so I so I I thought I have this conversation [lah] so
moral of the story is all based on out <malay>niat</malay> [what] so if like #allah# decide on where we should go
because if if we were to be judged on our sins <malay>dengan kita punya</malay> doings and everything I think nobody in this world in these deserving of #jannah#
good person
sinners
sinners who repent
ya [lah]
plus point
<malay>tapi tak</malay> minus
<malay>dah ada</malay> stated there
<malay>dia tulis</malay>
so #allah# is fair like that #allah# love us in a way that way [lah] I think that's how I think islam to me islam is a very loving religion [ah] a very loving very empathetic
compassion
society
first thing society [ah]
<malay>islam</malay>
ya
I hope for that <malay>ustaz</malay> also yesterday that <malay>macam</malay> he's saying [lah] <malay>macam</malay> we should educate our child
that
that be modest <malay>penting</malay> is part of islam and all but <malay>kita pun kena ajar anak kita</malay> that you know doesn't mean that <malay>dia tak pakai tudung</malay> she is not modest enough
like we are not okay we have to teach our child like that because we have to teach our child <malay>macam</malay> what islam is all about since young and it starts from <malay>asar dia cakap</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>macam tak semestinya dia tak pakai tudung kau tak boleh kau tak boleh cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>dia tak</malay> modest <malay>dia bukan perempuan yang baik-baik</malay> it's not a good thing [ah] to me personally [lah] because <malay>pada kita agama kita kita punya amalan</malay> is all <malay>masing-masing</malay>
true
I think just now [ah] flying all my <malay>tudung</malay> then <malay>macam apa ni</malay> ten
#lam soon# singapore <malay>ke tadi</malay>
my expire date is thirty first july two years after this
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [eh] what
ya [lah]
perfect
ya maybe we
<malay>kita dah pernah kena</malay> judge [lah] that's why we don't we know how it is <malay>kalau</malay> people judge us
like sis <malay>pernah kena</malay> judge <malay>masa</malay> sis <malay>kerja dekat</malay> [ah] my previous workplace <malay>yang kat</malay> #tai seng# <malay>tu</malay> [kan]
[ah] I I <malay>apa</malay> after I started <malay>pakai balik tudung</malay> right
slowly [lah] I think after that <malay>dah dua tahun</malay> [ah] but it's still slow still new [lah] then <malay>masa tu</malay> [ah] I was judged by one of the co-workers [lah] <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>aku tak suka</malay> [ah] <malay>perempuan pakai tudung</malay> then I asked why [lah] then <malay>dia macam</malay> [oh] <malay>semua perempuan pakai tudung semua sama nampak</malay> [jer] <malay>baik</malay> but behind <malay>semua hisap rokok</malay> [lah] <malay>ambil laki orang</malay> [lah] I <malay>macam</malay> who are you to judge like <malay>macam</malay> just because <malay>satu orang buat kau nak</malay> judge <malay>aku macam itu</malay>
ya [lah] but it's not <malay>perempuan pakai tudung</malay> [jer] <malay>buat apa yang tak pakai tudung</malay> also <malay>buat</malay> [what]
so why are you judging just because we wear <malay>tudung</malay> wear <malay>tudung</malay> doesn't mean <malay>yang kita ni malaikat</malay> [what]
and then sis <malay>macam tak puas hati</malay> [lah] <malay>kena</malay> judge <malay>macam itu</malay>
you meet american union people start a
step <malay>baik</malay>
step good good
(hmm)
<malay>kurang ajar betul</malay>
what do you mean
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [sia]
ya [lah]
then if I judge all muslim men are or all religious men are <malay>semua pun macam tak betul</malay> how
ya
at first sis was like sis <malay>dah jadi</malay> defensive [lah] because all of this is something new to me
like at first my friends <malay>semua tak nak</malay> friend with me
because <malay>macam alim begitu</malay> [kan] she don't wan't to friend with me <malay>sebab</malay> she say [ah] <malay>kau dah pakai tudung</malay>
then <malay>buat apa kau kawan dengan orang jahat macam kita nanti kita buat kau jadi jahat</malay>
then I say to her [lah] <malay>tak semestinya</malay> that I wear <malay>tudung aku baik</malay> [seh]
I wear <malay>tudung</malay> is because I wanted
to
change for <malay>agama</malay> [lah]
like sis want to change like <malay>sampai bila nak jadi macam itu</malay> maybe if I wear <malay>tudung</malay> it will remind me to to to be modest
to proper to be more proper to <malay>macam jaga diri</malay> in public
like sometimes <malay>kita dekat</malay> public <malay>kita</malay>
you know like <malay>macam dulu</malay> I never wear <malay>tudung</malay> then sis <malay>pakai baju</malay> low cut and <malay>nampak macam niat kita tak nak tunjuk</malay> [tau]
our intention is not <malay>macam kita tak nak tunjuk pun</malay> but <malay>nampak</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> to me it <malay>elak fitnah</malay>
[a'ah] especially especially if you wear <malay>niqab</malay>
when you wear <malay>niqab</malay> right <malay>dia punya niat</malay> is to stay away from guys right to <malay>macam</malay>
stop getting attention from guys right but in these in this modern <malay>nya</malay> days if you wear <malay>niqab</malay> instead you attract more guys
wanted to know you wanting to know you ya because
you <malay>kau tak</malay> normal <malay>apa</malay> like people want to know how you look like behind those thing
(hmm) a lot of guys are <malay>macam itu sekarang</malay>
then because
<malay>masa yang si</malay> #nurul# <malay>tu</malay> [kan] then <malay>yang pakai niqab dulu sebelum dia kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>dia pakai niqab</malay> [kan]
(err) ex #hafiz#
not the ex one [lah] the girl that she's getting to know [lah] <malay>yang dah kahwin</malay>
when she wear <malay>niqab dia nampak cantik</malay> [lah] like you will imagine her to be a <malay>cantik</malay> girl so many girls are adding her [tau]
and she received a lot of from guys [lah]
<malay>memang semua gambar dia pakai niqab</malay> she is very she is wearing <malay>niqab</malay> [what] so she delete all her pictures <malay>yang tak ada niqab</malay>
so people added her
she gains more attention by that
[ha]
like nowadays that people want to know you because you wear <malay>niqab</malay>
no
no
for what
but sis don't want to be <malay>macam tu</malay> but sometimes
<malay>ada apa</malay> you know in malaysia <malay>ada satu perempuan ni muda dia pakai niqab</malay>
<malay>dia pakai niqab</malay> and then she's very young then <malay>macam nampak mata</malay> [jer] [kan] then she <malay>berbual</malay> very <malay>lembut</malay> very <malay>lemah lembut</malay>
[ah] then like guys are attracted to girls like that so people like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! <malay>lemah lembut</malay> then <malay>muka kau cantik</malay>
then I when I was having this conversation with #hafiz# I was saying like you know I don't sometimes I don't I feel like I don't deserve to wear <malay>niqab</malay> [lah] because the purpose of wearing <malay>niqab</malay> is to grown away <malay>daripada</malay> attention [what]
so if like <malay>aku pakai niqab orang tengok aku</malay> then <malay>lepas tu aku berbual</malay> <malay>begitu</malay>
because ya
but sometimes we tend to forget like sometimes you know <malay>kita dekat</malay> public [eh] <malay>bodoh</malay> [lah] like that
because sometimes when we wear <malay>tudung</malay> also our <malay>cara cakap</malay> also still the same [what]
so sis feel that
(hmm)
then
<malay>bila</malay>
(err) <malay>pakai pakai niqab</malay>
<malay>pakai niqab</malay>
you <malay>nak jaga macam mana nak makan</malay> then <malay>macam</malay> like sometimes when we talk to guys like
<malay>tak tak</malay> open <malay>masuk kat masuk kat bawah</malay> [lah] <malay>tarik ke depan sikit masukkan bawah</malay>
I tried [what] once then I feel like I cannot
but then I say [lah] because when I see a people a girl wearing #niqab# (err) I have expectation on them [ah]
then <malay>macam</malay> I say <malay>macam</malay> I hear <malay>perempuan pakai niqab</malay> I hear <malay>dia orang macam</malay> giggle <malay>macam gedik</malay> like I don't like
[a'ah] [lah]
maybe because I have unresolved issue with <malay>perempuan pakai niqab</malay>
ya because to me like I have unresolved issue <malay>macam</malay>
like #neelofa# [ah] <malay>macam</malay> #neelofa#
what to expect
react
then how to react
to certain things
so <malay>macam</malay> so
people <malay>lagi macam</malay> have a better understanding of islam
so if <malay>kau</malay> react wrongly people <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>orang islam macam ini</malay> [lah]
no wonder [lah] you know that kind of thing
that's my personal belief [lah] like I wanted to add [lah] that especially during timing right
to me like it's
wear
wear [ah]
then I've asked myself if I were to wear <malay>niqab</malay> then I have to forsake a lot of my clothes [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> to change my whole wardrobe
then if I have to change my whole wardrobe then I I ask I ask I say myself like <malay>macam</malay> if I have to change my wardrobe that means all these while when I was wearing #hijab# I am not wearing properly
that I'm wearing for the sake of covering [jer]
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
big
big build ya
ya
then how [ah]
so sis <malay>jawab apa</malay>
but actually to look presentable is also part of
religion
but then if we wear like that (err)
people will judge us name like <malay>makcik-makcik</malay>
because we will be looking so dull
(mmhmm) maybe we should maybe we should start doing that [lah] <malay>macam</malay> #neelofa# you know like
she change the misconception that <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>pakai</malay>
<malay>purdah mesti</malay> boring but if she change [ah] <malay>dia tak macam</malay> sparkling <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak macam</malay> there's bling <malay>sangat tapi macam elok jadi macam</malay> okay [lah]
still
<malay>tak nampak macam makcik-makcik</malay>
what's the word [ah] the the the
ya #ringarde# I don't want to be #ringarde#
but
ya [lah]
true [lah]
and the creator
ya so like
so if you that's why they say when you <malay>pakai benda ni</malay> you are sacrificing the things that women like most
like being fashion
being looking like
<malay>cantik</malay> [lah]
ya
then remember <malay>mak</malay> saying you know like when you want to wear <malay>niqab</malay> when you want to wear <malay>purdah</malay>
you shouldn't wear things that very bright
because you are attracting people like if <malay>kau dah buat macam gitu</malay> that is
you just want to

<malay>kalau</malay> (err) <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>kalau macam terlalu mahal</malay> [eh] <malay>aku pun balik saja</malay> [lah]
I got no choice but

hey #nurul#
<malay>apa khabar</malay>
thanks for coming here
ya I want to know right (mm)
what is your ideal vacation like
[oh] for me [kan] I think I I really love planning I have to like
I have to know where I'm going I have to know what time I'm going I have to know what time this place close I I love
planning and then I
I may be too much by asking the people who go on holiday with me and like guys remember the schedule we supposed to go here by here <malay>jadi kalau</malay> you like told off what if <malay>sampai sini tempat dia dah tutup</malay> then like <malay>kita dah jauh perjalanan</malay> [kan] <malay>telah tutup</malay> so like
ya [lah] for me I'm quite a planner so but like for an ideal vacation other than planning
I would like to explore I wanna have a lot of nature in it so I <malay>ada orang suka bunuh</malay> very curious about <malay>bunuh</malay> [ah] and then I also like to <malay>tengok pokok</malay>
and then I also would like to go on autumn ya what about you like do you have like a favourite season
ya ya ya
sometimes I wish singapore has like four seasons so I can like you know you you there's something new to look forward to whether you just go out you look out your window [eh] <malay>hari ini ada pokok</malay> this colour [eh] <malay>hari ini ada salji</malay> [eh] <malay>hari ini ada</malay> and then like <malay>tapi kadang-kadang</malay> I <malay>fikir macam</malay> like
[eh] then that means our wardrobe would be like so interesting [ah] like (err) summer <malay>panas</malay> so like the material <malay>lain</malay> and then winter <malay>sejuk</malay> and then we get to wear more layers so it's it's it's interesting to like dress up but then I also think about [orh] the money
and then also like the <malay>rumah</malay> like
(um) we have to have heated floors <malay>ke</malay> heated <malay>jamban atau katil ke</malay>
<malay>lepas tu kita tak nak menggigil</malay> [kan] <malay>bila kita tidur</malay> like ya it's it's so it's so when I think about like why singapore don't have four seasons I also think about [oh] so if we have four seasons it's gonna be very pretty but it's also you also have to go through all these like
this small staff [lah] these small changes that you have to go through that maybe other people in other country they go through they don't like like maybe they don't like to clean their driveway from the snow because always slippery you know but then I don't know
cause I never gone through that ya [oh] (mm) so I wanna know right if you were tour guide where would you bring them if in singapore
how about I say first then maybe I give one then right
so <malay>untuk saya untuk saya</malay> ya <malay>untuk</malay> for me right I want to bring them to
gardens by the bay I'm gonna bring them to the cloud forest and flower dome because (uh)
it's to me it's one of a kind [ah] and then like (uh) so many different
flower species and then can can exist all in one place <malay>habis tu tapi kalau you fikir pasal taman-taman kat luar negeri macam tadi cakap pasal ada</malay> four seasons every country not [ah] countries have four seasons so if you go out to see a normal tree not in a park it's a different colour
so for them that's their speciality but for us since <malay>kita takde</malay> four seasons <malay>kita boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>kita pergi</malay> gardens by the bay [kan] to look at the different flowers and also different (uh) month would have different themes so I think that's quite cool so that's one place I would bring them gardens by the bay to see the the very pretty flowers
see experience all the different species in one area [lah] in a place like singapore where not everyday
where you won't get like four seasons
ya what about you like if you have like a favourite tourist place like
that is the #kampung glam# area
ya about the old school stuff like (uh) sometimes when we play card games you still have those like old maid or like
family is it poor family happy family [ah] sorry so like when I I I when I look at it you will still have this like !wow! so cool and you have like the complete set and then like like (err) last time it was easy to get right <malay>tapi sekarang macam</malay> like
<malay>mana</malay> [eh] <malay>nak beli mungkin kena pergi kedai ni tapi kalau kedai ni tapi sekarang kedai semua jual benda-benda</malay> modern so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>pun fikir</malay> [lah] like !wah! how how you get to source all of this old cards and then it's it's such a simple game also <malay>macam</malay> not so complicated and then also about games
(um) <malay>nanti kalau</malay> like if you bring tourists over to play games <malay>kalau kita tak berbual</malay> the same <malay>bahasa pun takpe</malay> because you know you just <malay>gitu gitu gini gini</malay> then maybe hopefully they will get it and then they will play along with us right this is like the joy of games like you don't really have to speak the same language
you just like have fun and like catch on from each other ya [oh] ya and I want to know (mm) which genre of drama or show do you enjoy the most
for me I really like (err)
drama like between people I mean I prefer (uh) movies [lah] because I I usually cannot sit in one to watch series so if I do watch movies I like to watch drama so drama between people they fighting
verbally ya not like doesn't have to be action-packed [lah] I also like reality (uh) so if it's based on true story then I can watch and then I will be like quite amazed like !wow! so this can happen in real life [ah] then like because like <malay>macam</malay> I'm quite curious [lah] on like
people story <malay>tapi takkan macam</malay> I <malay>nak keluar habis tanya orang</malay> [eh] <malay>jadi macam mana</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> life story ya I want to know more about it so I guess for me movies are one way to find out about people <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>jalan hidup</malay> without being so #kaypoh# about it
and then like after that (uh)
(um) [oh] there are some reality shows that I like which is kitchen nightmares have you heard
kitchen nightmares and I also love catfish
ya it's so like like whenever I watch this reality show especially kitchen nightmares and catfish right I always feel angry then like <malay>tengok dia orang macam</malay> like kitchen nightmare <malay>dia punya</malay>
[ah] chef of the restaurant then <malay>dia macam dia degil dia nak orang bantu dia dia nak</malay> gordon ramsay <malay>pun bantu dia punya</malay> restaurant <malay>kasi betul</malay> this stupid this chef of the restaurant he's like no I'm better than you no my food is
great so it makes me angry but then I still watch it and then it's the same thing with catfish it makes me angry because like how can people be so <malay>macam</malay> (err)
naive and like [oh] or <malay>tapi</malay> (uh)
<malay>muka dia macam gini mesti orang dia macam gini juga</malay>
you know people on the internet can be anybody they say to be right
you can lie on the internet how come these people are so <malay>macam senang nak percaya</malay> and then <malay>tapi</malay> like when I watch this also I can feel sad [lah] because when say if I watch catfish it's usually the same thing the people who have been catfish they just want
a friendship they want somebody to connect with and <malay>macam</malay> they cannot <malay>dapat</malay> that connection <malay>dalam</malay> real life so they have to go online ya and like what do you think about like catfishing <malay>macam</malay> have you experienced something like that or like
then then then that's the thing I like about gordon directs you don't care about what other people face but because he's just there to help you is is genuine enough to have user and ya I if you can't everywhere also got one side of the starting also
ya that's what three fun [oh] then like so what are your favourite movies
harry potter
for me my favourite movie <malay>banyak juga</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> <malay>ada satu jadi ada satu</malay> movie <malay>ni yang</malay> I <malay>suka</malay>
(uh) it's called #kahani# ya you've watched it with me before we've watched it
so one interesting fact is that (um)
I watch this movie I think four times already that is a lot for someone who cannot sit down and watch series let alone I watch like four times of the same movie so do you know that the
first time I watch the movie was during work
so (err) ya it wasn't even during lunch I was just like
<malay>macam</malay> my <malay>kat</malay> my handphone <malay>kat tepi jadi</malay> I <malay>tengah buka</malay> my computer <malay>jadi tangan tu</malay> I took out a keyboard my <malay>kepala</malay> facing my computer screen but then my eyes are darting towards like the the phone screen at the side so my body language is like trying to tell everyone okay guy
<malay>tengok</malay> I <malay>tu tengah macam</malay> [ah] <malay>bekerja ni</malay> [eh] <malay>tak ada apa-apa tapi sebenarnya mata</malay> I <malay>tu tengah tengok</malay> bollywood <malay>kat tepi tu</malay>
and like <malay>cerita</malay> bollywood how long is it usually three hours right
yes
I think (uh) also the thing about watching this (uh) a lot of times with different people right it makes me (uh) find out more about (err) the person how they think about that movie and then sometimes like <malay>dia orang dia orang akan tengokkan</malay> [ah] then <malay>dia orang akan</malay> pick up different things that you didn't see
ya so like [eh] I watched this the second time but I didn't see it the first time but this person that I'm watching it with
picked up in this movie so I think <malay>macam gitu</malay> it's quite cool to like <malay>tengok</malay> (err) with <malay>lain orang</malay> [ah] to see <malay>macam dia orang punya</malay> perspective <malay>tu semua</malay> ya and then like (um)
[oh] what about like cartoons when you were younger what kind of cartoons did you watch
(mm)
I think
cartoons I don't watch some cartoons that I watch (um)
I really enjoyed sesame street ya sesame street
it was so interesting because like there's humour is there there's also like (uh) this muppets is it so ya and they all look so different and everybody's living so happy together like !wah! damn cool [leh] <malay>macam macam</malay> and then like
(mm) I <malay>pun suka tengok tengok dia orang cuma dia orang kita tak dapat tengok kat sini</malay> so it's actually <malay>dari sana</malay> [lah] <malay>tibanya impian saya rumah idaman saya</malay> ya so like it's thanks to sesame street that I that's how my dream house is which is actually unfortunately very expensive [lah] it's like
millions of dollars and I only have like maybe not enough but it's a it's a childhood dream it's it's I I think it's still very important [lah] so it's ya sesame street was very fun all the different characters I think my favourite character do I have a favourite character I like big bird
he's a good guy ya and then elmo also <malay>macam</malay> quite interesting
ya so very cool cartoons [lah] and like just now you were saying about K dramas right so the K dramas the
you you say about boys over flowers that was also my first (uh)
first korean drama that I watch and that's also how I got into K pop ya because of their soundtrack ya so like
the soundtrack that I listen to and the actually <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>dengar</malay> soundtrack
(um)
sometimes when I watch movies also <malay>lepas saya tengok</malay> movie <malay>tu</malay> I like to go and listen to the soundtrack cause I curious right I want to know (uh) how the song sound like all that ya what what
do you think about songs for movies like are there any particular songs or movies that are memorable to you
if you it will be what would it be
or what kind of like
[orh] ya [lah] soundtracks are very important to a movie right because like and then like when you remember a song maybe sorry when you hear a song and then you'll be like [oh] he most pair
almost paradise and you see you know immediately it's boys over flower so or like you know this song
the [ah] every night in my dreams what movie is that
titanic you see so iconic right you see
<malay>bercinta</malay>
[oh] I like this question because I like wishes
(uh)
honestly right I want a thousand more wishes <malay>kerana saya seorang yang tamak</malay>
ya okay so the other two wishes would be say for world peace <malay>jadi pasal</malay> (err)
<malay>lebih ramai</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi semua orang lebih baik hati menjaga hati</malay> #blah# #blah# #blah# and then also I want the environment to recover because we have done a lot of damage to earth right I don't want us to be sad I don't want earth to be sad ya what about you like what kind of three three wishes do you want
[oh] not a lot of people will say food why why why food
(mm)
unusual superpowers !wah! I've always wanted to try to be invisible because I think when I be invisible right I can like go anywhere I don't have to pay for my bus fare I don't have to pay for my ticket fare then I can do whatever I want so I can like eat
stuff I can just go behind the counter I can go to the cake eat or maybe if I want to try some clothes right then I can like <malay>masuk dalam</malay> and I <malay>pakai baju</malay> and I <malay>tengok cantik ke tak</malay> [eh] and then also maybe say if I want to go to like amusement park !wow! I don't have to queue [eh]
I just go inside I sit down and then I enjoy the ride and then people pay seventy dollar
then I pay nothing so I think ya [lah] that's that's what I want to
do wanna be invisible because <malay>macam</malay> quite
(uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> freeing [lah] ya freeing then (err) nobody knows
who I am I can do whatever I want so [kan] I can <malay>beli buat benda bodoh orang pun tak tahu siapa</malay> I [kan] <malay>pasal tak nampak pun</malay> ya what about you what kind of superpower you like
that's a very cool superpower
what do you think I am thinking of right now
it's always about food I think (uh) the reading about minds one sometimes (uh) I think it's cool but I'm also scared about it because like what if I find out something that's
I'm not supposed to find out
ya ask me
of course no problem
the one thing that I wish was free is (um)
actually why one thing [ah] why cannot be many things I say education ya
because like to put in perspective right this year I try to apply for uni so unfortunately the uni <malay>mahal</malay> [lah] <malay>satu tahun lima puluh ribu</malay> so you imagine <malay>kalau lepas tiga tahun berapa ribu tu</malay> (uh)
(err) <malay>ribu puluh ribu kali tiga</malay> it's like hundred fifty thousand where am I gonna get that money you know
<malay>yang tu caranya</malay> a lot of money so then and then (uh) I think so that's in my perspective personal perspective where I don't have like a lot of money and then like what if I think about other people like (uh) I remember (uh)
<malay>saudara</malay> where they had to lay <malay>antara dapat duit</malay> bursary <malay>atau budak tu</malay> move on to a better education so <malay>kalau budak tu dapat duit</malay> bursary <malay>maknanya dia kena</malay> stay in
(uh) not so not the best education <malay>untuk dia</malay> and then if that that <malay>budak</malay> goes on to (uh) a better education he might not get
(uh) the money so that is like so sad right why do you have to choose between money and education you know then also like because I think education <malay>macam</malay> it helps to break poverty cycles [lah]
ya so like the example I just gave you right people are stuck in this loop because they [ah] have to choose between these two and both are important right [ah] <malay>yang mana awak nak pilih yang duit ke untuk pelajaran</malay> ya [oh] ya another thing actually very important (uh)
sanitation which is clean clean toilets
ya because it's like you know sometimes when you go travelling right you go countries and then you'll be like okay <malay>kita pergi dia punya</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> petrol station <malay>nak pergi</malay> toilet <malay>nak pergi</malay> toilet <malay>tak kat</malay> [ah]
[ah] petrol station <malay>dia nampak tak dia punya jamban</malay> so many different
colours and so many different smells so like
it's so
basic clean toilets and then like so I cannot imagine how different countries
if we were to stop ourselves from going toilet because it's so disgusting and then in the end we become gross you know ya what about you what do you think what what do you one thing you wish was free
yes
[oh] if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
okay so my friends and I <malay>kita selalu berbual</malay> how like we're stuck in jobs how we have to work from like nine to five <malay>habis tu bila dah habis kerja kita penat</malay> and then we don't feel like doing our own hobbies <malay>tapi kita tetap</malay> couldn't <malay>kerja</malay> because <malay>kita perlukan duit</malay> right
we need to keep working to get money because we also need to have bills to pay we want to buy stuff and then what if you want to enjoy so that you want to travel also you still need money so this is another loop
so I guess the one thing that everybody would want is just to take a break
you know just to be ourselves just to enjoy life so that's one thing I think that (uh) people would definitely be doing if we didn't have to work ya
what do you think like like what do you think about vacations and all that what would be your ideal vacation
[oh] ya so like ideal vacation would be so interesting right <malay>macam</malay> people <malay>ada dia punya macam jawapan dia orang dah tahu apa dia orang nak mana nak pergi tapi tak boleh buat pasal dia orang asyik kerja</malay> like how much more longer you gonna work man like ya
that's cool my mother likes gardening also ya and gardening (err) she has made a lot of friends [eh] from gardening like sometimes when she's in the the gardening the small garden community garden right downstairs so <malay>kalau dekat sana seorang kadang-kadang ada orang lalu nanti dia tanya</malay>
[eh] <malay>awak sini berkebun</malay> [eh] then they ask her [eh] can I join or not like
[eh] then they make friend blah blah blah so that's actually how she expand she expand and expand the network so it's quite interesting to see like [oh] it's through these hobbies we you know when you just doing your own thing you just enjoying and then people see you having fun and then they also want to have fun right
!wah! so nice and like she she she's I I like to see her having fun [lah]
ya what what about you like hobbies what kind of hobbies you want to try what kind of hobbies you wanna like !wah! how come hobbies that didn't work out what kind of hobbies do you enjoy now
for me my hobbies has always been arts [lah] I really like arts whether it's like <malay>macam</malay> music <malay>atau</malay>
makeup eye makeup <malay>lukis ke apa</malay> [kan] it's very fun and like (uh) I think about hobbies
say if I were to play like music or like (uh) art right I have to practise so I really enjoy practising music because it's like really fun ya what what do you think about practising do you think it's fun or do you think it's like annoying
ya it's true [oh] then I wanna ask (um)
see like (uh) what sort about like music right cause I'm interested in music I really like music right <malay>jadi apa</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> favourite <malay>lagu</malay> [eh]
<malay>apa-apa</malay> genre [lah]
(mm)
think for me (mm)
<malay>kalau lagu melayu</malay> [kan] <malay>lagu melayu</malay> I <malay>ingat macam</malay> more
to <malay>bahasa</malay> indonesia I don't know why but I really like their music you won't need to recommend me more like malay stuff [lah] I think my <malay>bahasa</malay> indonesia is quite good so recently there's this song it's called
<malay>mengunci ikatan jadi maksud dia</malay> [kan] <malay>macam mengunci ikatan jadi macam</malay> memory [lah] <malay>dia nak simpan</malay> memory <malay>tu dia tak nak lupakan</malay> (uh) actually I got this song right from a drama a a drama on YouTube it's so good it's only
four episodes ya and then (err) the way they shot it also like the beach I mean everybody loves the beach it looks so beautiful and then they play this song also so it's also memorable
so ya that that's that's one of my newer favourite songs [lah] and it's also by an artist that I really like (uh) actually last year the <malay>dia ada datang</malay> singer last year maybe last year <malay>atau dua tahun lepas dia datang</malay> singapore <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak tak pergi</malay> !alamak!
what about like live music (err) <malay>pernah ada pergi tak dengan</malay> experience <malay>ke tak</malay> live music
to this place
for me I really love concerts [leh] like it's too bad [lah] this year cannot go concerts but I think that's okay because I get to save money right
(uh) then like (mm)
for me [kan] my (uh)
concert <malay>yang macam paling</malay> memorable <malay>tu dengan</malay> my sister <malay>juga</malay> [ah] <malay>ni bila dua ribu tujuh belas tengok</malay> coldplay [oh] actually an interesting thing about this was (uh)
when I went to buy the tickets for this show so I remember the people in front of me they were not fans of the show they were people who wanted to buy as many tickets as they can right <malay>jadi dia orang nak jual</malay> at
a higher price
ya [lah] so like for me (uh)
as a frequent concert goer [kan] you always hear stories of people who
sell tickets at a higher price so it was quite surprising that [oh] my goodness I am standing in a line and then in front of me is the person who does this you know because all this time you read online and then suddenly you see the person in front of you it's like
ya so that was not only the concert itself was memorable [lah] <malay>tapi dia punya bila</malay> part <malay>beli tiket itu pun</malay> memorable but in a <malay>sedih punya</malay> memory ya
[oh] ya I (mm) what about <malay>macam</malay> (mm) <malay>ni punya</malay> fashion style like how would you describe your fashion style
think for me my fashion style I always like to (uh) dress up I like to experiment since I was a kid so I always like try to go for like maybe but my normal life would be say smart casual then maybe I would like to try streetwear
and then (uh) if you look at my closet I like to have outerwears because it's so easy you just layer on and then you go it's finish
ya and (err) I I like to wear navy blue what about you what what kind of colours you like to wear
ya so like colours are really fun right to play and then <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>setiap orang</malay> [kan] <malay>ada warna dia tetap untuk diri dia</malay> I mean like ya if you wanna like have fun go ahead you wanna be comfortable go ahead ya I got random question for you (uh) ya do you believe in love at first sight
I don't believe in love at first sight ya that's why I ask you I wanted to know your opinion ya because for me [kan] (uh)
<malay>apa jatuh cinta pada pemandangan yang pertama macam pelik</malay> [eh]
cause for me right my crushes are usually on like after I know the person after I know their character after
I see them do stuff after I hear them say stuff then it's like yes I like this <malay>ciri-ciri jadi</malay> I <malay>suka orang ni</malay> [lah]
so like (err) personally I've never fallen in love at first sight and I think it's
<malay>pelik</malay> ya
ya what is it
I think this [one] [eh] your hardest question [eh] how can you ask me to eat one dish for the rest of my life how can like that
when the world has so many very nice dishes you ask me to choose one dish (mm) how can I don't know about dish [lah] but I think right for I [kan] you know my <malay>mesti</malay> I <malay>pilih</malay> okay <malay>antara</malay> syrup <malay>limau atau teh</malay> O <malay>ais limau</malay>
ya I think (uh) like <malay>teh</malay> O ice also I mean you can <malay>minum panas</malay> it stays great and then you can <malay>minum sejuk</malay> it taste great
and then like but if you drink syrup <malay>limau panas-panas ada ke orang minum macam gitu tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>mungkin ada tapi</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay> ya and [oh] so (um)
about this the the one dish for the rest of your life then what about like (um) say if you want to move to a country to stay for the rest of your life where would it be
for me (uh) just now you mentioned korea right you say you really like the the place all that down to the culture
[oh] I was thinking
(mm) korea I think okay but like
I want to say the language is a barrier ya but sometimes it's the food also
ya
I had a
not a very nice experience when I was at the airport because
(err) <malay>apa ni kat</malay> airport <malay>tu dah nak terbang tapi lapar gila belum makan</malay> my <malay>makan tengah hari pun</malay>
<malay>sikit</malay> [jer] I think maybe just (err) what do they eat #japchae# [ah] #japchae# I guess I'm the person who has to eat rice right to be full but I ate #japchae# #japchae# is noodle ya ya
so then I didn't eat for like dinner and then I was at the airport and there was no halal food I mean there's halal food but you see their airport is
very big [ah] so I if I were to reach there I calculate [lah] like cannot reach there before my gate open what if I reach there then the the <malay>kedai tutup</malay> then <malay>mesti lapar</malay> [kan] so I remember I I I only bought <malay>kacang</malay>
<malay>kacang makan</malay>
<malay>habis tu</malay> I only ate in taiwan
!chey! cause taiwan
was the transit ya and then that's where the food on the plane [lah] so I the so these are the things that I think about when I want to think about living in the country
it's simple as food as simple as (uh) language culture culture I feel like you can adapt to it ya I don't know I don't think there's a country for me that I wanna stay forever I think I like to jump around
in singapore for tourist place right I like to go nature ya cause I like to relax <malay>jadi bila</malay> I <malay>nampak pokok</malay> I <malay>nampak</malay>
(uh) <malay>air air tenteram</malay> I <malay>tak fikir banyak</malay> I <malay>boleh dengar</malay>

what about you is there are there any favourite sounds you have
[oh] that's cool ya flowers really makes me happy also I I don't think I have a favourite flower [lah] but I I love looking at like baby breath tiny flowers it's like something small it's not about the size but
especially when they're small and then like daisies also ya you remember the daisies that we saw at coney island right !wah! they were so cool

[ah] you know talk about your you got kids talk about your (uh) your life about you <malay>punya</malay> health (uh) like that [lah]
[oh] yes (uh) I'm more like want to have a peace of mind [lah] just want to have a peace of mind that that that I think (uh) because (uh) we have been through a lot you know for the past year
you know we have been like rushing through things so I now I think this (uh) the ten years time is to whereby I would like (uh) you know (um)
(um)
relax myself there is no rushing to settle down
[ah] <malay>betul betul betul macam kita nak apa beribadah gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>banyak kepada mungkin ukhrawi</malay> [lah]
[ah] [ah] [ah] like for you how
there will be new one I let go
(um)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
so meaning that [ah]
that means if in ten years time you will be thirty [lah] so at that age you
you still want to like (uh) you know pursue your interest
(uh) in science
<malay>tapi sebab tu</malay> [lah] <malay>nak kena ada macam apa tu orang kata</malay> (uh) <malay>barang-barang yang ada kena-mengena dengan sains</malay> [lah] okay okay okay okay okay
okay
<malay>cakapnya tak sampai pun sepuluh minit baru empat minit</malay>
<malay>dia tengok</malay> time [lah]
<malay>juga</malay>
(mm) (mm)
okay
(uh) if there was a drama [kan] (um) I mean I like to watch action movie [lah] actually
martial arts <malay>ke</malay> action movie because that is really cray you know to me
ya cause action movie
(uh) it really like <malay>macam</malay> excite you (uh) you really makes you awake [tau] <malay>macam tak mengantuk</malay> you know at least at least [eh] when you watch [eh] your mind is not really working
working but then you you
you really like (um) awake that means you're really awake and you are like (uh)

(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay okay
(mmhmm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
how come got become an actor choose body or looks
if I become an actor no [lah] that [one] is different question
(mmhmm)
(uh) I think fit body [lah] better rather than good looks I mean I no doubt good looks is important but then fit body is actually got to do with stamina because if your body is fit meaning that you have a better stamina (uh) you see if you are talking okay I mean not only about actors [lah] okay I mean like everyday life also [lah] we are talking about everyday life
I mean fit body is most is the most important
[ah] <malay>kita nak ke mana-mana kita nak pergi apa tu katakan</malay> [lah] <malay>pasar ke kita nak berjalan ke mana ke bila kita ada</malay> fit body
you know you don't feel lethargic easily you don't feel tired easily you see
so you are always active but imagine that if you don't have a fit body only good looks
right I mean what can you do I mean
of of course [lah] you have the looks you know <malay>tapi kalau</malay> your body doesn't fit
what can you do you know I mean fit body is the the most important [lah]
yes correct correct
ya correct of course (um) of course we want both we want fit body and good looks you know because usually people say that if you have a fit body you have a good looks (uh) you know [ah] people say you have it's naturally
it's like when you make yourself fit then your body your look also will be like (uh) <malay>macam orang kata tu cerah</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>macam</malay> glowing [kan] [ah] glowing so I mean it is
it is naturally [lah] like that
so what will you think
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
ya so you see [eh] like nowadays generation you can see the different generation [eh] how they are very (um) they spend a lot you know to buy makeup for their own looks
you know or maybe makeup makeup makeup dresses but they forgot about to take care of their health they forgot about (uh) what to eat and what not to eat you see [ah] <malay>jadi dorang banyak macam</malay> [ah] <malay>apa tu tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>banyak pergi mana tu</malay> (uh) <malay>makan</malay> fast food [kan] [ah] you see they they they forgot they forgot about the healthy foods
but then they they they always [ah] you know
(uh) they always think <malay>yang</malay> the important is to to have a good looks you know <malay>buat</malay> expensive makeup you know and then wear [ah] good good clothes you know so that they will look good
that is only external but not internal you see [ah] this is what they they forgot [lah] so I think (um)
younger generation need to be educate <malay>mesti kena dorang kena kena tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>kena banyak membaca</malay>
and then [ah] <malay>dorang kena tahu</malay> [lah] you know (uh)
<malay>macam mana nak apa tu</malay> [ah] <malay>mencegah penyakit daripada awal bukan macam</malay> like when they have already got the sickness they got disease then they will do something then they will try to exercise then they will try to
(uh) do the prevention then they will try to start to to eat healthy food I think no [lah] I think from from ya I mean <malay>daripada awal dah kena</malay> start [lah] <malay>macam</malay> choose <malay>makan-makanan yang terbaik itu semua</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) okay because I think about mental health [ah] it has to be
(uh)
it is not really easy to say [lah] okay it's not easy to say because we do not know [ah] what are the experiences that [ah] you know people (uh) I mean <malay>orang orang orang</malay> experience
[ah] <malay>pengalaman orang</malay> [kan] cause everybody has their own experiences <malay>ada</malay> background <malay>yang berbeza</malay>
so <malay>jadi</malay> (um) this mental health <malay>ni</malay>
(uh) I mean okay [lah] <malay>memang makanan tu penting</malay> okay that is the most important okay the what you you eat
you know like <malay>macam</malay> they <malay>selit</malay> lots of vegetables and fruits you know and don't take too much of sugar [ah] that is already <malay>dah</malay> important [lah] you know because even then
[ah] <malay>secara</malay> holistic yes and then
okay but then some people say some people say that (uh) but I I take vegetables I take also (uh) I don't drink too much of like canned drinks and all that but I still got mental issue you know [ah] depression ke <malay>apa</malay> so I I so I <malay>rasa</malay> that (um)
I <malay>rasa</malay> it is how you manage [lah] the situation
[ah] how [lah] you manage and you did also like <malay>macam</malay> talk to people (uh) with with your family you don't keep to yourself
see if you have any problems let's say you youngsters [eh] <malay>macam</malay> like when youngsters [eh] <malay>kita tak boleh simpan diri sendiri</malay> [lah] <malay>kita kena bercakap dengan orang</malay> [ah] <malay>bercakap dengan</malay> family <malay>tentang masalah kita abeh pilih kawan-kawan yang</malay> very <malay>menjayai</malay> you know
[ah] that any friends that you think that (uh) that support you and any friends that you that (uh) you know can give you advice to go to that type of friends you you cannot keep to yourself [lah] whatever so that it doesn't when you have a problem you don't bottle up
[ah] <malay>jadi sesama</malay> [lah] you <malay>tak payah tak ada macam asyik nak fikir tentang masalah</malay> you [kan]
[ah] at least at least you have (uh) somebody to help you on how to solve the your problem
you long stem from under you know really overwhelming

(mmhmm) (mm) (mm)
(mmhmm) (mm)
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm)
I think ya it's true it's true I think that (um) okay when you talking about the schools [eh] (um)
not everybody can actually cope okay cause human being [ah] they they have their own limitations okay their their own limitations
so <malay>kadang-kadang orang ni dia boleh</malay> accept (uh) the first degree of stress
<malay>yang ada</malay> [ah] second third degree <malay>pun masih boleh terima</malay>
[ah] ya depends on <malay>dorang punya</malay> capacity so I I I think like everyone they must know their limits
and and parents <malay>pun tak boleh</malay> push [ah] cannot push them because if they know that their kid they must know they must know and understand whether their kid because if their kid are not the kind <malay>yang</malay>
can take the stress so you cannot push them further [lah]
[ah] because [ah]

[ah] then you woke again then you you like play again you know [ah] you don't think so much about paying bills you don't think so much about other people <malay>punya</malay> problems like you have your own problem and you carry out your own problems you know you don't really think about other people <malay>punya</malay> problems ya <malay>macam</malay> those memories are I think are the best [lah]
ya but
ya correct but I know that not everybody [lah] have their own good childhood memories
(uh) there are some also children they are traumatised by their childhood memories you know that is not good for for for them [lah] but as for me my own experience (um) if I have a timer like what you say you know (uh) where where where do I want to go I <malay>nak pergi tu</malay> [lah] the my childhood life [lah] (mm)
so how about you
[oh] okay
(mm)
(mm)
the theme
within a floor think you can it you mention long term
(mmhmm)
so <malay>jadi</malay> (um) what you say you want to go to the the ages [lah] okay okay
I think <malay>peringkat umur</malay> [lah] [eh] I think (uh) that that that is the reason [ah] why like <malay>macam</malay> you you are still young you know
<malay>jadi macam rasa nak apa tu orang kata tu</malay>
(um)
<malay>orang kata tu pengetahuan nak nak</malay> (uh) <malay>kembangkan lagi pengetahuan</malay>
(uh) [kan] <malay>nak</malay> expand [kan] <malay>lagi</malay> your knowledge <malay>so jadi</malay>
you <malay>rasa sebab</malay> you <malay>perlu pergi</malay> to that ages you know to <malay>nak lebih mendalami lagi</malay> (uh) <malay>benda-benda yang</malay> you <malay>tak pasti benda-benda yang</malay> you <malay>tak tahu</malay> (mm)
yes
it will do money like you know let me near grew from a nuclear war they're gonna company I think it'll be grateful
(mm)
(mm)
(uh) three wishes [eh]
(um) okay
okay the first wish that I can think of is (uh)
a healthy life [lah]
ya I I just want to have a good healthy life
and then (um)
<malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>yang kedua ketiga apa</malay> [eh] okay [lah] <malay>yang pertama dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>kedua ketiga macam tak tahu lagi nak fikir apa apa lagi nak cakap</malay>
[oh] okay maybe (um) <malay>wang</malay> [lah] [ah] I think [oh] I <malay>nak jadi seorang</malay> millionaire [ah] <malay>bukan sahaja</malay> healthy <malay>tapi</malay> my wish
<malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>ada duit seperti jutawan jadi seorang jutawan ke apa</malay> [ah] I mean not for myself but I think [ah] I like to help others ya help others and then I like to give I like to give to charity [ah] I'm a very like <malay>macam</malay>
people oriented ya I cannot see people especially children [eh] when they are in need children in hunger [ah] you see at some countries right where they are being left like you know in in a war by their parents
dead and all that so I think (um) a bit sensitive to their situation
then <malay>bila kita ada duit tu kita ada ilmu yang banyak</malay> [ah] <malay>kita boleh sedekah kita boleh berikan kepada dorang</malay> so I think <malay>tu yang yang</malay> can give me the most satisfaction [lah] <malay>itu</malay> second wish [lah] second wish ya first first first first wish is healthy then second wish (uh) <malay>seorang jutawan</malay> [ah] <malay>kaya raya</malay>
<malay>sekarang ni kurang kaya</malay>
okay then the third one the third one the third one (uh) the third one
what is it [ah] third one [ah]
[ah] <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] you <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] what's your first wish and your second and third wish if you have
(mm)
like for me right I think the other wish is that (mm)
since I have (uh) children so of course I I don't really ask [ah] more like of course [lah] as a a parent you want to see your children [ah] succeed in their life you want to see your children like <malay>macam</malay>
have and will be a successful because the of course that is (uh) <malay>memang tak terkecuali memang</malay> you <malay>nak tengok anak</malay> you <malay>berjaya</malay>
but (um)
you you you you always want to see that your child is also healthy [lah] healthy body and healthy mind
(uh) and then the the best part is (uh) good behaviour because I think there is no point if I wish that my children to be successful in life
but then they do not have a good (uh) behaviour they do not know how to respect old people they do not know how to
(um) respect others
(uh) yes then (um) the their they do not have the love you know or compassion or what towards each other you know so the the behaviour that value is the most important [lah]
(uh) to me I mean there's no point they succeed in their life but then
they are arrogant you know they arrogant towards other people <malay>macam sombong gitu macam apa tu</malay>
(uh) <malay>tak nak dengar kata orang lain</malay> you know <malay>macam terlalu</malay> ego <malay>ke</malay> so I
I I just hope [lah] that my children are not like that and then (uh) I just hope that whatever that my children do they must (uh) always think that life is really temporary
(uh) in this tough life it's it's all temporary there is there (um)
(err) <malay>tidak ada perkara yang</malay> (uh) <malay>kekal dekat dunia ni</malay> so <malay>jadi</malay> (uh) whatever that you have whatever that cherish it [lah] cherish it and also share share among other people
[ah] that is my my wishes [lah] I I think for my for my children
for my children
(mm)
<malay>hancur</malay>
people will like <malay>macam apa tu</malay> [ah] respect you [lah] respect you
yes correct no I mean (uh) of course when you have money and all that people don't look down on you
you know [ah] in this life right <malay>manusia manusia ni dorang</malay> [ah] <malay>memang akan tengok pandang tinggi</malay> [lah] <malay>kepada dorang yang berduit ni semua</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> you <malay>berduit tapi</malay> you <malay>tak ada akhlak pun boleh pandang rendah juga</malay>
[ah] you see so the best thing is (uh) whatever it is ya <malay>buat yang baik</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada duit pun tapi</malay> you <malay>sombong</malay> [kan]
[ah] so <malay>tak ada gunanya</malay> [lah] <malay>orang pun</malay> people don't look up for you people don't look into you and people don't treat you as a someone that can show a good example to generations you know and people will forget you I mean if people want to remember you yes but people remember you as a person who has who is arrogant [ah] you know you have a
I mean ya bad reputation and
correct
yes yes good nature correct
ya
yes yes yes yes correct
<malay>kalau ada</malay> superpower [eh] <malay>kalau ada</malay> superpower I <malay>nak habiskan kerja rumah dalam satu minit</malay>
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> flash [ah] speed [lah]
[ah] <malay>macam tu macam</malay> speed <malay>gitu macam</malay> whatever that I want (uh) I do [eh] I want to do in a very fast manner
[ah] you see
then I I I clean up the house right like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! <malay>habis</malay> one minute gone or two minutes !wah! all the house clean already <malay>semua dah bersih</malay> !wah! see I I I
(uh) I mean like then you can have <malay>apa orang kata tu</malay> relax <malay>lama-lama</malay>
[ah] <malay>rehat lama-lama</malay> [ah] but unfortunately I do not have that such power
(um) <malay>tapi kalau ada</malay>
ya no
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
ya
ya
there is (uh) good and bad [lah] we are talking okay let let us you know talking about phone first [eh]
see [ah] there there is a good and bad [lah] when talking about phones okay (uh) cause when the good part is that
the the information is at your fingertips
[ah] you know nowadays try you want to find like okay eateries okay you just google google and see you get eateries
you know like mac also you also using your phone don't need to you know like last time you use (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] you know <malay>senang semua</malay> but okay <malay>dulu kalau nak masak kita nak kena fikir buku pastu</malay> flip flip flip the pages [ah] <malay>sekarang tak payah sekarang</malay> [ah] <malay>sekarang</malay> [ah] you <malay>tengok</malay> [jer] youtube
[ah] you google [jer] okay <malay>nak cari resipi apa masak apa</malay> [ah] then you know from then on can you can already (uh) find the recipe that you want
you know it's it's it's it's very it's very easy [lah] and everything information at the fingertips but
main problem like <malay>contohnya</malay> I think for adults [eh] adults should be okay because they already know how to use the phone they know [ah] they know when to use it you know (uh) they they know like <malay>macam</malay> when not to use it you know they they they have the <malay>orang kata tu tahu bila nak</malay> focus <malay>tapi kalau</malay> children <malay>memang</malay> talking <malay>budak-budak ni</malay> you see when they are already get used to phones at an early age [eh]
this is what we are afraid of that they get hooked into it and then after that they forget about other things they forgot about doing things you see like nowadays
you have TikTok and <malay>dorang dah</malay> [lah] <malay>macam malas sekejap macam sekejap-sekejap nak tengok</malay> TikTok <malay>sekejap-sekejap nak nak nak apa nak buat</malay> TikTok [kan]
[ah] <malay>kerja rumah semua terbengkalai</malay> then homework <malay>pun terbengkalai</malay> [kan] and then (uh) last time [eh] you see (uh) <malay>budak-budak dulu</malay> they want to watch the television they they if they want to on the television their parents will scold them [eh] cannot watch television [ah] you haven't finish your homework now they watch youtube also you do not know because the phone is with them [ah] you see so
the I mean it's difficult [lah] to control it is more I think challenging
[ah] now you know for the parents of the now the the younger generation cause they need to foresee them they need to control [ah] you know their children so it's I think it's not really easy [lah] it's not really easy
(mm) it's not really easy
[ah] you yourself you think how you because you yourself ask you to sleep you don't want to sleep you see you are you you you <malay>suka tengok</malay> youtube you <malay>suka tengok</malay> netflix [ah] <malay>lagi sekarang</malay> netflix <malay>selalu dekat</malay> phone [ah] you see <malay>susah</malay> [kan] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
<malay>nak nak nak</malay> stop <malay>ataupun kita nak ketepikan</malay> (mm) handphone <malay>tu</malay>
you know maybe you got for you it's got an educational purpose now
(um) <malay>pun ada</malay> good and bad <malay>dia</malay> [lah] maybe maybe I understand that people they are using this is to maybe cut cost
of (uh) you know human skills and all that but then when you think about it [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> were to take over humans [kan] then what humans going to do you know certain things <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] [kan] certain things I think (um) can you know take over humans <malay>tapi</malay> certain like <malay>macam</malay> profession <malay>tak boleh</malay> take over humans [ah] you know I think certain certain professions [lah] not all professions you know <malay>macam</malay> doctor you that's why <malay>boleh jadi</malay> doctor [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> <malay>jadi</malay> doctor
I <malay>rasa</malay> patient <malay>tengok pun takut takut dengan dengan dengan</malay> [ah] you see <malay>ataupun</malay> nurses take over nurses I I don't think so [lah] that's why I tell you <malay>macam</malay> certain professions (uh) <malay>memang tak kena</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> I mean take over
still need (uh) you know human ya you still need human touch you know human skills you know and then can you imagine <malay>kalau</malay> take over <malay>abeh kita ni nak kerja apa</malay> [ah] you know how to earn money like that
(mm)
ya correct
(mm)
cause because I think everything is being programmed in the
[ah] so that means like they only know and they only create this based on what is being programmed
see so <malay>kalau macam</malay> humans [kan] <malay>lain</malay> humans [kan] [ah] humans <malay>ada</malay> limitation [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay> sponge [kan] humans <malay>dia boleh</malay> adjust
[ah] you see so <malay>ye</malay> [lah] and and to add to that and to add to your <malay>ini</malay> [kan] questions you <malay>tengok macam</malay> [ah] <malay>apa</malay> maid <malay>pembantu rumah</malay>
[ah] you see you are not going to to let the to become the maid of the house right [ah] you know like in terms of like cleaning up maybe [lah] can but then in terms of you talking about [eh] taking after the old people don't know (uh) how to how to really like <malay>macam</malay> like you say [lah] human touch they lack of that
(um) you see
ya I mean mean of of course
use use the app for for <malay>macam</malay> good purpose [lah] I think for cleaning up no problem because like like <malay>macam</malay> you talking about cleaning up there's not much of like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) I mean skills yes you must have the skills but not so much of like <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) thoughts to put into it you know when you do cleaning up (um) like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) you do the job cleaners and all that (uh) simple simple job can take over [lah]
(uh) you know but other jobs that require (uh) you know you need deep thoughts <malay>ataupun kemahiran</malay> [ah] <malay>macam kemahiran yang orang kata tu yang yang besar</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> doctor <malay>dia punya kemahiran dia betul-betul besar</malay> [kan] so <malay>takkan</malay> you <malay>nak suruh</malay> take over [kan] (mm) you see
<malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>tengok kepada keperluan pada keadaan pada keperluan pada keadaan memang</malay> when you talk about technology in years to come [ah] <malay>macam-macam</malay> [kan] technology <malay>akan datang</malay> so <malay>jadi</malay> (uh) we'll see [lah] that
<malay>mana yang lebih perlu</malay> [lah] at which at which sector
(mm)
(mm) [ah] [ah] then after that
ya
ya
!wah! I think [ah] I think with this right people will have develop more mental health problem
rather than you know like <malay>sekarang sahaja orang dah macam-macam ada banyak masalah</malay> mental problem <malay>sekarang</malay> I think <malay>kalau ada kita nak adakan</malay> <malay>lagi</malay> (um) <malay>orang kata untu menggantikan</malay> (uh) all the professions (uh) <malay>orang akan ada banyak lagi masalah</malay> mental health problem
(mm) and and and one thing and one thing <malay>pun</malay> I think (um) if you <malay>nak</malay> have this right <malay>untuk menggantikan</malay> the soldiers <malay>pun</malay> not bad so that you you don't use so many soldiers let's say you go to war [ah] [kan] <malay>tak ada ramai</malay> [lah] human beings <malay>yang mati</malay> (mm)

ya and that's why it pressures me so much like you keep talking about having a car having a car then I <malay>belum kerja</malay> [seh] <malay>kita belum</malay> apply <malay>rumah belum kerja</malay> then you <malay>nak</malay> talk about having a car

then
<malay>tak boleh</malay> because this thing is not (um) <malay>macam baru baru</malay> [jer] they say [oh] you cannot ride but it's been like years already it's this to this to this <malay>macam</malay> they don't want to change it [lah]

with his pay and then him supporting me it's it's not so bad the only reason why it's a bit <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> it feels like we're we're living from pay cheque to pay cheque is because of our wedding is on hold
yes we we are still saving for the chinese wedding
so our money is already like thrown into the wedding and everything right

why don't you go first
(mmhmm)
yes the #bunny chow#
<malay>mengidam</malay> [eh]
(uh huh)

ya and I feel like it was a new experience in terms of how they presented it
<malay>pasal pasal kita orang duduk tunggu makanan</malay> or the #bunny chow# <malay>tak tahu apa akan datang tiba-tiba</malay> it's a whole loaf of bread
a full loaf of bread and the top is cut
like like a like a hat it's like a hat like you take off the top
and then a pool of curry inside so it's like basically a loaf of bread with a hole inside and it's just curry
(mm)
ya ya and it was recommended <malay>ramai orang suruh</malay> order
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
yes yes
and it was a it was a weekday it was a normal weekday working day kind of thing
(mm) (mm) (mm)
yes we were very hungry
ya
ya and then I feel it's also the the service
[ah] <malay>cara dorang cakap dengan kita orang macam kawan gitu</malay> so <malay>kita orang saja</malay> [lah] <malay>tanya-tanya</malay> [eh] <malay>apa-apa yang sedap tak pernah</malay> try <malay>ini semua</malay>
<malay>terus</malay> (err)
<malay>apa nama dia pekerja dia suruh</malay> try #bunny chow# <malay>terus ada satu</malay> customer <malay>pun suruh kita orang</malay> try #bunny chow#
<malay>terus kita orang</malay> try [ah] ya <malay>ingat tak</malay> the customer
<malay>terus</malay> !wah! it it was the best decision we've ever made
yes we did but it was it was a day of of trying food it was a it was a food adventure day ya
yes
[oh] okay okay ya we tried the
steelers I think it was a local
burger joint but it was a
fast food
burger joint
ya
yes
ya <malay>kita nak makan banyak kira</malay> you know pros and cons <malay>kena</malay> give give in ya !oof!
and (uh) that was quite nice also
I felt
that was quite nice ya the burger cause before that <malay>sebelum tu kita orang</malay> try [ah] McDonald's
then <malay>saja saja</malay>
<malay>saja nak</malay> try <malay>tengok</malay> country <malay>apa negara lain macam mana dorang punya</malay> [ah] McDonald's
<malay>tapi tak tak sedap sangat</malay> [lah] singapore <malay>punya</malay> standard <malay>terlalu tinggi saya rasa</malay>
[a'ah] I I <malay>boleh boleh rasa yang ini</malay>
<malay>ini bukan makanan yang patut di makan</malay>
like not like basically not healthy you know what I mean like you can tell it's not a proper meal you know like I shouldn't be eating this that kind of thing
ya
I forgot but but it it didn't it didn't stay in my mind cause after that we tried steelers and I was like !wow! a whole new experience ya
[ah] <malay>ye ye ye ye ye</malay>
ya
yes
not spicy
ya not not up to our standards our tongues
ya
just just another day
yes we did we did
ya our our spice game was
was really showing on during that trip like we really felt it
ya
ya so after that we tried steelers and that was good what else did we try that day or did we call it a day afterwards
I think we also went to this (err) the cake malay restaurant right cause they they have the in in
south africa they have their own malay community
<malay>jadi kita orang saja tengok apa apa ni</malay> plus <malay>kita pun orang melayu terus dengar kat sana ada ada</malay> community <malay>melayu juga</malay>
(uh) <malay>jadi kita ingatkan</malay>
<malay>walaupun</malay> (err) the history is different we thought we should at least try the food
<malay>makanan mesti ada mesti ada</malay> [ah] <malay>sedikit</malay> [ah] <malay>yang sama</malay> [kan]
[ah] so we went over there and tried
but I forgot what exactly did we try do you remember

(mm) was a thing it was a mixture of things
but it was interesting also
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
it's a different history and everything [lah]
different background
ya ya ya
(mmhmm) but it was interesting also to to experience that and sort of see the different variations I guess on the culture
(err) practise in different ways and then ya I think I think it was it was <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
is it #prata#
ya
(uh huh) (uh huh)
ya ya ya
!wow!

[oh] [oh] I remembered inside it was a whole thing like inside there was fries and then there was there was <malay>daging</malay> and there was cheese it was
it was basically like
loaded in every ways
it was [oh] it was basically like #roti john# but they throw in (uh) fries also so ya and <malay>sayur</malay> also so it was like a whole meal with a
<malay>dengan</malay> ya I remember just taking one bite and felt like I just finished lunch

it it was still a nice view nonetheless
<malay>dua jam mak</malay> [ah]

yes
you know right
[oh] it is how it feels like if you live next to mountain and you just go up and down the mountain everyday like
like how I go #bukit timah# hill and I see all these random people run and run but actually they live next door right
[ah]
it was it was quite challenging sometimes
ya some parts we had to go down on all four do you remember there were like ladders and whatnot

good like surreal
ya
[a'ah] <malay>tu tu</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>angin dia kuat angin dia terlalu kuat sampai rasa macam</malay>
<malay>angin tu nak tolak kita orang</malay>
[ah] [a'ah]
[oh]
cause we were we were going around in circles like you know a hill and then naturally
eventually there's like one part where okay one part
the thing about cape town in terms of geographically is very interesting one side of the hill you are near the ocean the other side you are near the city
so when we were at the end that's near to the city it was quite hot
but the end near the ocean was quite windy so everytime we reach the hot side we were just <malay>jalan macam biasa saja-saja lepak sikit</malay>
<malay>terus sampai ke tempat yang terlalu sejuk tu tiba-tiba</malay> [ah] <malay>angin dia kuat tu tiba-tiba kita orang terus lari lari lari</malay> [eh]
[kan] that was an experience friend
(mm)
lion (uh huh)
[a'ah]
[a'ah] <malay>memang orang yang nak naik dorang pakai baju apa</malay> mountain gear <malay>tu semua ada yang</malay> stick <malay>panjang tu</malay> [ah] hiking stick <malay>dorang tengok kita macam apa pasal apa budak-budak ni kita orang saja</malay> [jer] <malay>jalan pakai pakai beg beg sekolah gitu</malay>
ya
ya ya but they they were had like the the bike gear on and
[ah] I remember when we got down the first thing we did was get a drink right do you remember
ya
and we just rest and reflect <malay>apa kita orang buat tadi</malay>
!wah!
ya we went quite ya damn early
(mm) (mm)
and then I remember technically we had time to explore but we were so tired
ya for one two hours then eventually we went out just to have a walkabout
ya
that was quite fun though
that was very fun
but I really want to go back just to see signal hill see like [ah] <malay>tak puas</malay> cause like
the the goal isn't there and then like sometimes I read up about cape town people talk about signal hill and I'm like
[oh] we haven't went
cause I I like
cause I was really curious I actually <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] video signal hill <malay>macam mana terus nampak tempat dia macam permandangan semua cantik ada apa orang duduk atas atas</malay> grass <malay>semua</malay> okay like I never said I didn't regret that experience it's just I really want to go signal hill next time
feel like we didn't accomplish that
okay sure I feel like we are
two zero

with a whole new list
I got I got #jio# one friend she she also malay okay we all <malay>melayu</malay> together
like the other day I was talking to her her name is #amisyah# and she's like I was like #amisyah# I really feel that we go somewhere it's for you ya I feel like you will enjoy it as much as I think and then she's like I did thought about it and I feel like I belong
and I'm like okay put it in the to-do list okay
before we die

should draw or the kind of level they should achieve which I can tell I am not at that level [ah]
so there's that so instead of a drawing I resort to colouring
I resort ya cause I I do like
(err) art in general so I'm like since I can't draw
then I'll just fill in the colours for them you know it's it's so
an artist right it it does gives me a pride and joy and happiness
ya yes
and I I feel like it also trains my (uh) colouring skills
cause that's also (uh) colour coordination is a very important skill
ya I mean for a wardrobe purposes
so ya
I think for me would be drawing
(mmhmm)
what about you
just one [ah]
can
[oh] !wow!
yes that's the way
okay
I [ah] I feel
I feel like the fact that it's on the you know ice it's a bit tricky
and different
okay
!wow!
[a'ah]
[oh] !wow!
kind of what
okay
(uh huh) [ah]
ya it will
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(uh) yes
did they die
[oh] gosh
okay ya
ya will be fun
so (uh) what else
two more skills
for me (um) other than drawing
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay> (uh) swimming
I cannot swim and the other day I went to this this park with my friend and it was
it was at lakeside I was at lakeside
with my friend
and then I and then I remember [ah] my dear friend #wen xing# were walking at this
at this bridge bridge <malay>dia</malay> is a made of wood is a wooden bridge but naturally a wooden bridge can be a bit creaky
so I think she she she no no no she stepped on this a creaky wooden bridge and she panicked a bit and she was like I really thought I was gonna fall and I'm like
[oh] shit if you fall I'm gonna fall also cause we are stepping on the same wooden creak [eh] and I'm like and the first person is gonna die is me cause I can't swim
it's really during those moments I realised that I should really pick up swimming [lah] ya
but I know how to swim a bit like I know how to float like I'm aware like there's a certain way of of making sure that you stay afloat in water and I I at least learn up to that point [ah]
the (um) <malay>tahun lalu</malay> I went to #krabi# <malay>dengan kawan</malay> #krabi# okay
so naturally the activity is just go
beach hopping I don't why I thought it's okay to be honest
I I didn't regret why I even but when you think !wah! it's like !wow! this girl really spend a lot of money to go #krabi# when she doesn't swim or kayak so
I went to #krabi#
with my friend it's just the two of us and I remember before going I already told my friend A I don't swim and B I'm not a water person like I'm the kind where I can in the water but five minutes later I'm like
I'm bored leave me alone I'm just gonna sit at one corner and my friend is like ya that's fine I'm also the kind where you don't have to entertain me I can have fun by myself she she really is the typical (uh) suntanning beach kind of girl
so I'm like okay okay so the trip is really we just in our own personal space like
like people who people don't know we went together you know it's really we are all both in our own personal space
trip and then like I remember she really was having the time of her life you know like she really down there chilling like there was even one point I told her [eh] I'm bored
I'm gonna go back to the hotel which is like fifteen minutes away from the beach
and then she's like okay great and then I went to the hotel I took a nap
okay I took a nap for hours I wake up this girl is still not back
so cause it's just the two of us I the sister part of me is like [eh] shit she got kidnapped I die [sia]
like I will be responsible for that <malay>jadi jadi</malay> I remember after that I
like <malay>dah dah bangun dah dua tiga jam pergi balik</malay> to the beach check up on her she still sun tanning down there
<malay>tak</malay> no it was it was it was already like
seven like she really just lie on the beach throughout that kind of thing then I just look at her and I'm like
okay can I didn't even know if I should go and say hi cause she was wearing a a sunglasses so I'm like I don't know if she's awake or she's not I don't know if she's gonna scold me ya I was like
you know I feel like I remember I played in the water again but five minutes later I'm bored
now what ya but ya I feel like (uh) if I could swim maybe I might I I I feel like definitely enjoy myself
I just feel like maybe I could have done more activities
ya
we didn't do we went the only water activity was the the beach hopping [lah] so
ya they just bring us to the beach and then they let us roam around for many hours
and I remember I was very fascinated by the fishes <malay>pasal dia punya air air dia</malay> clear [kan]
<malay>jadi boleh nampak ada banyak ikan warna-warni</malay>
banana boat <malay>ada tu ada</malay> [lah] but
ya and A and B I don't find banana boat interesting
ya
have [lah] but ya I also like (uh) and then my friend was also (uh)
I I think don't have I don't remember but I remember we went kayaking but the kayaking was very scary cause it's like
initially I thought that the kayaking would be
a a group activity I thought there will be a guide but instead they just give us the kayak and they were like do whatever you want
yes so it's
free do whatever and then they give us a map and they were like usually people circle here but ya do whatever you want just come back at this time and we we really just we tried to circle but but eventually I remember we went okay the thing is <malay>kita orang dua bukan orang</malay> kayak
no okay it was in the middle of the ocean A okay B in the middle of the ocean okay
it's like it's like you you know how in #krabi# there's a lot of islands so one of the islands we did kayaking and then (err) this island is a bit small so the idea was to circle the island that's what they told us to do but I remember looking at my friend not gonna circle this stupid island
and then she's like
#nadi# stop being a spoilsport let's try then I'm like fine so we try
and then I remember okay <malay>mula-mula</malay> there were like a few there were a few family members okay so we started out with a group then eventually they went a certain way and then we just split and I I didn't care [lah] too much about that cause we we already had a plan cause me and my friend we thought we gonna circle like and halfway through
we realised that we were in the ocean alone like I looked around I don't see people I was like [eh] shit this is like I'm in the ocean alone and I can die and then
that's where all my anxiety thoughts come out while my friend being the typical girl who loves beach tanning was legit taking out her phone and taking selfies
then I'm just like
her name is #vishu#
I'm like #vishu# we gonna die then she's like can you stop being dramatic and I'm just like
I feel like okay the thing I love about hanging out with #vishu# is I always tell people she's my number one hater I mean everytime I tell her my like all this problems she's like
shut up okay she legit she pushes me down there and then I don't know like I like remember cause she's an accountant so I will always complain about how I don't know how to calculate this money and she will just tell you're stupid I know that kind
so
this is our relationship it's really her telling me over [oh] I'm stupid and then I'm just like okay you're right I agree I am stupid
so throughout the whole trip I will just be panicking and she's down there [eh] no we are fine okay I'm not gonna die and then she and then I'm like okay but if I
if I drown then are you gonna save me and then she's like no
then she's like I thought you can take care of yourself
that's the thing okay so
I remember like I did panic a bit but eventually I managed to calm down and then we went we went to
(uh) the big shore
so there was this random beach in a thing and then we went to the shore and we chill for like
again five minutes
cause we we we after five minutes like I'm bored so we went back but I remember throughout the whole trip that whole kayaking I kept telling myself I'm not gonna do this ever again and that was really my last kayak up till now cause like in singapore
there's certain places you can kayak right <malay>kalau kita orang nak kita orang boleh bayar</malay> [lah] but anyway <malay>gi</malay> kayak <malay>dekat</malay>
[ah] <malay>tahu tapi kawan-kawan</malay> I <malay>semua suka benda gini jadi dorang kata kat</malay> marina barrage <malay>ada kat</malay> lakeside <malay>pun padahal ada</malay>
[ah] cause (err)
ya marina barrage ya ya and then
(err) I a few people have #jio# me I have one friend who has the actual kayak lessons so she has told me many times don't worry if you drown I I will save you
and then I looked at her face and I'm like thank you for you trying to act this is a superhero movie but it's okay
I will I will tap out of this korean drama moment
maybe I feel like the the swimming will help the the fear of the sea cause a lot of my problem is afraid of the sea but I feel like the fear of the sea stems from the fact that I can't swim
ya [lah]
ya ya ya
ya
ya I I actually (uh) <malay>baru belajar macam mana nak</malay> float <malay>masa kat</malay> #krabi# because (err)
I <malay>suruh</malay> ya I <malay>suruh kawan saya</malay> [ah] <malay>ajar macam untuk</malay> sorry [lah] [eh] #vishu# teach me how to swim then she tell me I teach you how to float
always doing the bare minimum
always doing the
ya yes
good enough okay <malay>jaga diri sendiri</malay>
more you already say live one another alone
<malay>ye</malay>
ya ya !wah! I I really want to go okay I
I I think after the trip I went with her to vietnam to vietnam
I went vietnam when I went there right
she ya we went mountain !wah! that [one] was another [one] cause she cause I've known her for quite some time so she knows all my problems all my problems
so before we go out on the mountain trip she already told me [ah] #nadirah# <malay>jangan lupa bawa apa bawa gula-gula ke apa pasal</malay>
<malay>kalau tak nanti</malay> [ah] <malay>nanti penat pengsan kau dah</malay> [lah] <malay>selalu pengsan kau jangan</malay>
ya <malay>bawa gula bawa apa</malay> protein bar <malay>ke apa</malay>
and I remember I tell her confidently don't worry I can take care of myself sis
don't worry thank you for reminding me though
I'm like !aww! <malay>tak aku tak bawa</malay>
<malay>aku terus lupa</malay> cause naturally
on the way up cause okay <malay>naik naik gunung tu dalam dua hari</malay>
<malay>dua hari kita orang kita orang naik atas lepas tu</malay> [ah]
<malay>kita orang ada bayar</malay> guide [lah] <malay>untuk bawa kita orang ke atas</malay>
<malay>lepas tu dorang ada</malay> [ah] <malay>ada tempat-tempat tidur</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> this small kind of chalet there was even campfire kind of thing
<malay>terus ada makanan dorang masakkan</malay>
<malay>jadi memang dorang betul-betul betul jaga</malay> [kan] <malay>kita orang</malay> [lah] <malay>dua hari naik turun naik</malay> [eh] <malay>naik ada</malay>
<malay>kadang-kadang ada hujan juga pasal</malay> time <malay>tu macam</malay> june june <malay>daerah kita orang daerah</malay> southeast asia [kan] monsoon season [kan] [ah] [ah] <malay>terus ada kadang-kadang hujan pun kena</malay> stop <malay>apa semua</malay> and then I remember there were certain point where
(err) I was very tired cause I have low blood sugar low blood pressure
so after if I don't have enough food after a certain time [ah] my blood pressure will dip and then I will faint
and then during that period
my dear my dear #vishu# looked at me and do you bring your sweets
and I said no
then she rolled her eyes and then I'm like I'm sorry for letting you down again
and then and then I remember on this trip it wasn't just the two of us she brought along two other friends her two other friends looked at us what's this tension what's going on
I like
but really it was like
don't worry #nadi# I got this I know you very well she took out she got protein bar and okay okay #vishu# is a fitness freak okay so her protein bar isn't like from seven eleven kind protein bar is those expensive shit kind of protein bar that you need to order online kind of thing
so she give me her protein bar then I like A her protein bar tastes great but B I like shit I I swear I ate her her expensive shit a part of me is like okay I am a burden so yes
but I remember that one trip is like everytime I need a sweet I just look at her like this
then she will take out from her bag and she will like roll her eyes and take out from her bag
ya then she did that but then I remember <malay>macam</malay> the whole trip she was like I told you to bring
I like sorry
but ya I remember ya in the end we reach the top and that was that was really interesting cause there was actually
A cable car up but obviously we didn't take the cable car okay and B I remember
[ah] <malay>dari bawah naik tapi masa kita orang</malay>
<malay>lima belas minit</malay>
(mmhmm)
but I remember that
like <malay>lima belas</malay> twenty
it wasn't that long [lah] it was quite long also
ya but I remember at the top of the mountain there's a temple cause we're at vietnam and they believe (err) buddhist country most of them believe that
the higher you are to the sky the closer you are to heaven in thailand also I remember one of the mountains were like that but anyway
it's like if you there you see the statue is like <malay>besar gila</malay> so the only thing that came to my head is how did they bring all these stones up
it it look like they you go google is like a hole big ass buddha statue at the top like it's like way big like it was a giant-sized kind of thing ya
<malay>entah tak tahu</malay>
but ya that was the only thing [lah] I was just like !whoa!
how did this work there was no cable car then
how
ya I don't know I just find it interesting [lah] but ya [lah] then I remember after the trip we basically we <malay>kita orang</malay> tour from the north
to the south of vietnam so after a few days we spent one or two days in one country then we will take a bus ride to the next [eh] not not country
the city <malay>dalam satu dua hari naik bas terus pergi negeri lagi satu macam gitu</malay> and just get moving down down down all the way to #ho chi minh# kind of thing
and then I remember in the beginning it was [ah] there were four of us
halfway through the other two
her her friends had to go back to singapore cause [ah] they
they had other plans [lah] okay
ya
no [lah] no me and #vishu# are cool okay it's just that people people who are not friends with us will find it weird cause we really like talk to one another very <malay>kasar</malay> like but we are actually damn cool with one another like we understand one another and our boundaries and whatnot and then [ah] after that (err)
ya and then I remember halfway through it was just me and her [lah] ya and then when it was me I know it was more chill cause like initially when there was four people I have nothing against them [lah] but <malay>agaknya pasal tak tak kenal jadi</malay>
naturally when I go with a group I feel like everyone should have a good experience so I always like ask [oh] <malay>kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa</malay> then I figure out what is the best thing to do but then there was one girl who always had a lot of issues
then everybody like cause okay firstly it wasn't supposed the whole trip <malay>bukan</malay> holiday holiday [tau] the whole trip was supposed to be a backpacking trip so naturally there are limitations in terms of the place we stay and you know [ah] like you cannot be too luxurious [lah] <malay>dia macam</malay> too suspicious
of everyone too unsure like should we do this should we not
that kind of thing <malay>terus aku ajar naik</malay> motor cause <malay>aku boleh naik</malay> motor [kan] <malay>terus dia kata</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau orang</malay> catch <malay>kita orang tak ada</malay> license <malay>macam mana terus aku macam</malay>
<malay>siapa nak</malay> catch <malay>kau</malay> [sia]
ya <malay>aku</malay> realised just okay <malay>siapa nak</malay> catch <malay>kau kalau kau rasa kau takut sangat kau naik belakang aku</malay> [lah] <malay>apa-apa jadi aku ada</malay> license then I was like <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>kau takut banyak</malay>
<malay>sana punya orang punya</malay> license <malay>pun</malay> [a'ah] <malay>dorangnya</malay> license <malay>pun</malay> questionable [kan]
[a'ah]
<malay>lepas tu macam nak try makanan makanan dia kalau macam suara dia lain sikit dia pun takut dia macam macam</malay> like some of the food were were like crocodile meat ya
just like okay I feel like okay if you don't want to try then don't try [lah] like I don't know she will like says [ah]
and she will complain complain a bit a bit unsure [eh] maybe we don't do this maybe we don't do that I tell you like
like [eh] [ah] [oh] <malay>terus pasal dia punya kakak pernah datang</malay> vietnam <malay>jadi dia</malay> based her own experience <malay>dari situ dia kata kakak</malay> I <malay>kata macam gini gini gini tapi masalah dia kakak dia satu orang kalau dia bilang aku yang dia</malay> survey <malay>seratus orang boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>aku aku dengar aku dengar apa dia kata tapi kakak dia</malay> [kan] <malay>satu orang</malay>
like you can't based your experience your you know all your options on one person's experience that kind of thing so I remember feeling very like
like okay since you're uncomfortable then we won't do it [lah] cause of that we already have no options and to begin with we already had limitations in the first place
<malay>dia bukan cabut dia macam</malay> okay
[a'ah] plan <malay>dia memang</malay> until that time <malay>jadi</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal ada dua budak ni satu lelaki lelaki tu</malay> chill <malay>aku dengan dia kita orang jadi</malay> good friends <malay>terus habis tu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay> halfway through <malay>kena pergi</malay> laos
<malay>untuk</malay> internship
so it's a thing in their they are all accounting students so basically throughout the trip I didn't calculate anything it was my dream it was like suck at math like everyday I just look at look at my team of accountants like what's up guys so
I didn't remember [ah] ya so the boy like it was quite interesting though when we go on the trip cause they really like !wah! their calculations damn fast they look like they never speak they already can tell you okay this is not worth it they walk off I like what is going on but I trust all of you
then like okay [oh] I remember
[ah] <malay>kita kena fikir</malay>
<malay>kita orang kena</malay> calculate you know <malay>kat depan tu</malay>
[a'ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>dorang tak payah dorang tengok dorang okay tak payah tak payah aku macam apa ni apa tengah terjadi</malay> <malay>tapi dengar</malay> [jer] <malay>ikut</malay> [jer] ya
<malay>aku ikut asalkan duit aku tak tak tak buang lepas tu</malay> [ah] <malay>jadi budak lelaki tu kena pergi</malay> laos <malay>untuk</malay> internship
and then <malay>lagi satu perempuan tu</malay> [ah] <malay>yang masalah sikit dia padahal</malay> free <malay>tapi pasal dia tahu dia tahu yang aku dengan kawan aku memang kawan mungkin dia tahu dia</malay> (err) visitor sorry <malay>dia pun sebelum kita orang pergi sana</malay> [lah] <malay>dia dah</malay> decide <malay>yang</malay> okay
since <malay>budak lelaki ni akan pergi dulu aku pun akan pergi</malay> [ah] <malay>jadi jadi macam gitu</malay> [lah]
[ah] <malay>tak payah lama-lama</malay> [lah] okay [lah] that was that was a good experience I made a friend and I in the trip which is the boy and then the other girl I completely cut ties afterwards ya <malay>tak payah</malay> there's no reason anyway then ya I I learnt that apparently a lot of people in that class find it difficult to get along with her [lah] ya
and then I ask #vishu# then why you #jio# and then #vishu# was like you know I okay with travelling with everyone I always travel with you [mah] then I'm like shut up [lah] don't compare me to her but it's
ya that was it but that was a fun trip I had a lot of fun I was talking to #vishu# the other day we need to go somewhere else like after this border closed like this border thing
ya and she's like okay on
ya but I remember I went where [ah] ya #krabi# and vietnam with her
it's [oh] ya we keep saying we want to go somewhere malaysia nearby cause (uh) our our clique is actually with this two other like one of this (uh) basically the two of them they have a a very (uh) (err)
tight-knit families
who are unsure if they travel too far
so we were saying since you guys have limitations so might as well just go malaysia [lah]
ya
ya <malay>banyak tempat</malay>
[oh] ya
gosh [oh] ya and I was talking to my
other friend the other day another friend I was saying that we should go indonesia
cause it's nearby but there's also a lot of places to visit there ya a lot of people don't know about what ya they just didn't do marketing very well like there's technically a lot of places to go to so ya
(mmhmm)
ya that's the thing
<malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>dalam masa depan</malay>
[a'ah]
<malay>dah</malay>
okay
alright so how one two three one

okay <malay>boleh</malay>
(err) I don't really like the avenger I mean I'm okay I'm neutral about it but I will not choose like which avenger I would be
more of like which avenger I like and it's chris hemsworth so it's a thor guy thor god ya
ya its a god okay so (err) but like like if you really
want me to
(um)
choose
I guess
(hmm)
wait avengers <malay>pasal apa</malay>
captain america <malay>tak nak</malay>
black widow don't want [oh] doctor strange is nice
is he part of is he part of it I want change to doctor strange then
yes
lock in
what will you be then
no I'm like thinking if there's any other avengers
who are like (err) rich as well
is there any
he can make it big you know
(um) (um) I mean
what do I like (oo) I like comedy [oh] damn [eh] (err) superheroes I won't say specific superheroes like not really like a group of it so <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> group <malay>macam</malay> a bit too much <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you don't even know who to focus on right so if you have to choose then it will be spiderman but only the toby maguire version I don't really like tom holland the character
one thing tom holland is
one thing okay
he's young so he really suits it but I feel like I'm much more (um) what you call this thing convinced by the portrayal of toby maguire as spider man is very subjective a lot of people will be debating about this
but I just feel like at the point of time your teenager he was out there
there was this other person also andrew garfield you know
ya so (um) he his portrayal wasn't as good as toby maguire
like there's a lot of (err)
<malay>dia macam</malay> a bit awkward
<malay>gitu</malay>
(um) so <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia cam kekok</malay>
so like the way that he act <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> half-hearted <malay>gitu macam dia nak tak nak gitu</malay>
I don't know whether you understand what I'm saying but
did you just see the the the one <malay>yang</malay> (uh) andrew garfield acted ya ya watch all spiderman exactly I think that's why I think it relates my life I don't know
I mean he does have the face of like
[oh] my god when was the last time
#mulan#
<malay>aku rasa</malay>
ya <malay>aku tengok kat</malay> suntec <malay>tak tak salah</malay>
is it
think so
<malay>tak yang</malay> movie <malay>yang</malay> (err) real life action <malay>nya aku tak ingat siapa yang</malay>
(err) acting [ah]
(err) I'm re-watching friends over and over again can never stop man
okay documentary
I know I heard
<malay>sedih</malay> [pe] <malay>rumah kita kotak-kotak</malay> <malay>dok kau</malay> serious
<malay>jap jap jap jap jap</malay>
<malay>apa dorang jual dekat</malay> supermarket
okay so in your own opinion do you think that that it's actually a good way of
(um)
(mmhmm)
okay so <malay>kalau kita tukar penjara kita macam</malay> norway <malay>kau rasa boleh jalan</malay>
personality personally I don't think it works though cause like okay one thing capitalism
confirm <malay>ada banyak</malay> order in their own prison cell and and the fact that like in terms of like relapse I think like people will enjoy going prison because they know compared to singapore <malay>punya</malay> let's say (err) four room flat
amenities <malay>tak ada</malay>
(um) fridge
might not have the money to even buy groceries but in prison you have
so ya I think you really have to see <malay>dia punya apa ni</malay> culture
good share though will be interested to actually watch it on netflix
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[eh] !siala! <malay>rabak</malay> [sia]
(mmhmm)
<malay>aku boleh pilih</malay> [ah] <malay>dia punya</malay>
they will be tempted [ah] ya should shoplift in norway
what do you mean
(uh) ya
[oh] right right right
nice
<malay>aku pun tengah fikir</malay>
<malay>macam tak biasa</malay> [ah]
<malay>berbual</malay>
[eh] [sial] [lah] <malay>aku tak belanja</malay> [sia] <malay>aku sedih</malay> [sia] cause last year last year <malay>aku macam bingit sendiri dengan sendiri</malay> [tau]
(err) <malay>aku tak ada duit kalau aku</malay> [kan] <malay>kerja</malay> [kan] [eh] <malay>aku tak kerja aku sekolah</malay>
so <malay>aku fikir cam simpan dalam apa dia punya</malay> basket [eh] shopping cart <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>tengok</malay>
<malay>benda-benda yang aku nak beli takleh</malay> afford
<malay>sedih</malay> [sia]
ya then after that this year

<malay>aku rasa aku terbawa-bawa dia punya</malay> feeling for <malay>sebelas sebelas punya</malay> sale
<malay>macam</malay> it's nothing for me (um) <malay>macam</malay> I don't have to worry about eleven eleven because there is black friday

(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] you went dark so fast
<malay>asal kau fikir gitu</malay> [sia]
ya
(mm) (hmm)
(mm) (hmm)
(mm)
sis we all struggling here [ah]
<malay>aku rasa</malay> at this point in time
at least we are doing something about it right
comparing to like our twenties <malay>kita tahu kita tak solat lima waktu</malay>
and we're in denial of it <malay>macam</malay> other time in the future I will change but at this point in time like now you flapping I mean that's how I feel like <malay>aku cuba</malay> [ah] <malay>solat subuh</malay> like <malay>susah</malay> [sia] <malay>nak bangun</malay> alarm clock blasting here and left left and right
<malay>aku bingit</malay> [sia] <malay>selalu adamnya</malay> ringtone [kan] it's like super loud I just take his handphone just like this is so damn annoying <malay>dia punya</malay> vibration <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>semacam</malay> [tau]
ya and then like mine will be like birds chirping
its more mellow so <malay>bila aku bangun macam</malay> like [oh] bird you know its much more
ya
compared to <malay>bodoh punya</malay> handphone
ya so like (err) ya so like now I'm like
as a wife and and someone because I I came across this Tiktok <malay>belajar</malay> [eh] so I came across this Tiktok with post (err) they were mentioning about like (err)
as a wife or as a as it either wife or husband then you have to like remind each other to so like because if not then that would be you know your your your #taiji# [lah] basically so it's wife
we call it
where's your flaws may seems like whatever that might
what you call the thing
my <malay>kesalahan</malay> right <malay>kesalahan aku</malay> it's not
on my husband's <malay>punya</malay> shoulder
my my <malay>kesalahan</malay> is all just like my fault but his is his but if I do something wrong and he didn't like <malay>tegur</malay>
ya then that will be his fault
ya
so like it's the same thing as wife [lah] so <malay>sebagai isteri kalau aku tak kejut dia untuk solat subuh</malay> part <malay>tu kesalahan aku</malay> [lah]
so <malay>aku macam</malay> like <malay>aku tahu</malay> [kan] husband <malay>aku tak bangun</malay> then <malay>aku bangun</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> so <malay>asal</malay> [kan] <malay>aku kejut</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> <malay>kalau dia solat ke tak solat</malay>
okay <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> but that's how my understanding of it [lah]
ya
ya so this husband and wife thing it's it's really like teamwork
I really feel it after a year [eh]
being wife
communication that would be my response
communication is key definitely
because
like time <malay>kau bertemu janji</malay>
<malay>kau fikir macam</malay> like [oh] [ah] <malay>aku nak benda ni tapi aku tak nak bilang dia aku nak benda ni</malay>
like you assume that the other person will know
and when you have this assumption and this hope and when the thing doesn't come then <malay>kau bingit sendiri</malay>
right so right you just have to communicate whether you like it or not whether it will hurt the person you can soften the blow yes but as long as you tell and communicate
and learn it the hard way
only when I met adam there I would I know the positiveness
the value of communicating
what do you mean
ya
ya
that was what I been saying
okay okay so yours is more of physical yours is more of like a (err) a tangible mine is
I would always say mine is intangible but mine is like
(err)
verbal understanding technically its intangible is more of like the vibe that you get from your husband or your wife
ya
yes I I do acknowledge what you say because that's how my husband is like <malay>kalau aku tak tunjuk dia cara-cara</malay>
[ah] <malay>kesayangan ke apa dia fikir macam</malay> [oh] <malay>aku tak sayang dia</malay> so like I have to sometimes show him make effort
well and he does the same to me [lah] but for me I I rather have him communicate like what he wants or what he doesn't want because I cannot just assume <malay>aku aku macam</malay> in a way <malay>macam</malay> a bit
boyish [lah] so I I didn't I I sometimes assume and I I I don't know what he wants [ah] so he have to communicate he's the girl in relationships basically [lah]
I think we both know that [lah]
so ya sometimes <malay>dia macam</malay> hint hint hint then <malay>aku macam</malay> like what is it that you want and <malay>dia dia macam</malay> he's the kind of person who says things this way and that way and then <malay>macam</malay> like cannot make up his mind his decision then <malay>aku macam bingit</malay> [ah]
ya so just tell me what you want [lah] so in a way communication works
[oh] <malay>kau kau tolong dia</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk hantar barang-barang</malay>
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) (mmhmm)
<malay>tapi lepas yang kau cakap dengan dia dia harus berbincang</malay> like <malay>perasaan semua</malay> then <malay>apa dia cakap</malay>
<malay>untuk kau kot</malay> the way that you say it
(mm) (mmhmm)
<malay>dia mat teruk</malay> okay
<malay>dia pakai baju apa</malay>
okay (mm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya ya as long [ah] you communicate really because like if you think like you want to run away
<malay>dia macam adalah</malay>
what's that analogy credit card emotional credit card take it as emotional credit card <malay>bila kau</malay> run away [kan] swipe
you you you run away now you deal with it later so <malay>nanti dia</malay> accumulate accumulate [ah] then one day #bam# [oh] spark fire
ya
Tiktok
[eh] <malay>dok</malay> Tiktok <malay>aku dah</malay> obsessed [tau] <malay>dengan</malay> Tiktok
ya
there is there I mean there is one
[oh] damn
[oh]
<malay>tapi itu tak pakai</malay> that kind of idea <malay>untuk</malay> business <malay>kau sendiri</malay>

<malay>lima tahun</malay> [siol]
[ah] (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>kau nak apa</malay>
side
[oh] [oh]
[oh]
<malay>jadi apa</malay>
UNICEF [ah]
[eh] <malay>sembarang</malay> [lah] [ah] you
[ah] [ah] that's the one
<malay>asal kau rasa kau takleh takleh dapat pula kau</malay> [kan] designer
what what was the question
did you google
initiate
how do you do
in your essays in secondary school
I know I know
<malay>kau</malay> repeat english [jer] <malay>tapi kau tak belajar</malay> [kan]
<malay>tiga kali kau lambat</malay>
think you should work on your timings
<malay>syabas</malay> girl
paper two <malay>ke</malay> paper one
[oh] <malay>yang macam</malay> compre <malay>sekarang lain</malay> [seh]
[a'ah] <malay>dia macam</malay> like [ah] <malay>dia ada macam</malay> paragraph <malay>lepas tu ada macam</malay> like (uh) (uh) (err) <malay>apa ni bukan</malay> fill in the blanks <malay>macam</malay> just blank blank blank <malay>kat tepi</malay> [tau] so <malay>macam</malay> in this certain line <malay>kau cari</malay> idea <malay>dia</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> like if the for example the word (err) the sentence is this is the is the whatever then error is the repeated [lah] the is just write there is
ya basically <malay>macam</malay> [eh] it's vetting <malay>kau</malay> vetting proof reading its a proof reading exercise I am so jelly they don't have summary anymore
short form
<malay>aku tak faham</malay> [sia]
<malay>ni semua ni</malay>
<malay>dia faham</malay> [ah] yes sir do you
<malay>entah aku nak tahu kalau macam benda-benda</malay> <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>dia boleh berbual macam</malay> singlish <malay>berbual macam melayu</malay>
hey Alexa <malay>buka anak metropolitan</malay>
<malay>jawapan dia semua macam melayu-melayu</malay>
funny though
sorry but (um) yes (err) in twenty twenty four by twenty twenty four all students will get a personalised laptop
yup
yup
so much girl
do you know about the new syllabus [oh] not syllabus like the new programme education program that we have right now
so basically (err) I'm not sure which year
since last year <malay>tak salah</malay> okay I know this year <malay>dah memang ada</malay>
so
<malay>biasanya</malay> sec one sec two sec three
will have their common test mid year and the year right
as of now they don't have such thing theory change
it's what we call with the assessment so they have three of them already four of them [eh] so they go by percentage okay some pop pop quiz pop project work
and <malay>apa-apa</malay> whatever small activity last one will be end of the year exam
so they only have one major exam at the end of the year and that's really really high percentage which is seventy percent
ya so <malay>kalau kau</malay> screw up technically <malay>kau boleh</malay> screwed up the first three but then <malay>kau tak</malay> back up and <malay>kau tak belajar ke apa</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tak faham</malay>
that's it [ah]
so I do not know whether it's actually blessing in disguise for some people
but is that they want to like <malay>macam</malay> lessen <malay>dia punya</malay>
a stress on kids which I don't know it kind of doesn't work [lah]
because I hear students say I stress
ya adulting
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
[ah]
its its definitely different [lah] cause (um)
<malay>camne nak cakap</malay> [eh]
it it has its own pros and cons like for both the old system and new system because the old system you have lesser weeks to teach and you have more time not more time you let's say we should because you need to set papers and they have exams you have mid year their contents they have mid year and they have end of the year
this time around I only have one end of the year so technically teachers need to set one piece of the exam and the rest is just like activity and it can be like presentation it can be group work pair work whatever work so all of this it's in to
to the free time I won't say free time <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia ada kerja mana ada kerja sikit</malay> it depends on how you see it
I don't know whether you actually understand where I'm coming from but (um) for me if you ask me which one I prefer
as a teacher
<malay>sebagai cikgu aku rasa aku suka yang lama punya</malay> because it's much more as in its more pro for teachers rather than the kids because the kids would be more stressful <malay>ada tiga</malay> major <malay>tiga</malay> exam <malay>tiga peperiksaan ada</malay> common test <malay>ada</malay> mid year <malay>ada</malay> end of the year
so it's much more stressful for them
but for teachers its just set papers
if you if you if the way that you set paper is very stressful then that's on you [lah]
but
for me is is still okay cause
<malay>aku ajar</malay> art [jer]
ya
<malay>siapa buat</malay>
<malay>apa buat</malay>
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
<malay>senang</malay>
[ah]
<malay>aku rasa untuk budak</malay> [lah] <malay>menarik</malay> because like the fact that they know that this (err) the first three weighted assessment is not as heavy as last one so they can learn at their own pace but some students especially the sec ones
<malay>dorang macam</malay> like
<malay>rasa macam</malay> like <malay>dorang dah</malay> like <malay>gerek</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like [eh] <malay>tak payah belajar</malay> then <malay>ni ni</malay> [jer] <malay>buat buat</malay> quiz [jer] <malay>buat</malay> group work [jer] [ah] <malay>tak payah kita</malay> relax [jer] [ah] until they reach to the end [eh] <malay>bila macam</malay> september sept holidays [eh] [sial] [lah] next week <malay>ada peperiksaan</malay> [sial] [lah] <malay>aku belum belajar</malay> [eh] [sial] [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>tu aku belajar dari</malay> january <malay>tadi</malay> [ah] so <malay>dorang</malay> panic [ah] so if they would have to grasp they if they have grasp the concept
of the this topic that they have learnt in (err) in from january onwards right then you don't have to worry you [ah] but <malay>kalau dorang macam</malay> like [ah] <malay>aku tak kesah aku boleh belajar</malay> procrastination and it won't do
ya then they will be screwed up [ah] which is very common in my class
ya especially COVID this year

it's like chicken chicken and all
okay [lah] ya I mean actually it's it's like the chicken chicken thingy <malay>macam</malay> chicken wings so now they're having a promo they just open in hub twelve chicken pieces from twelve dollars cheap [sia]
so one is for one dollar
it's I would say the a normal chicken is like <malay>macam</malay> you go to #jinjja# chicken then you order the chicken wings right that's spicy or [ah] it's that one [lah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> but this is twelve for twelve dollars
ya it it's very cheap then their flavours also it's like <malay>macam</malay> got the korean chicken flavours it's like the wing zone [lah] got a lot of different flavour [ah] like all those the chicken chicken flavour so
we never go at there maybe we can go there [lor] check it out twelve dollar for twelve pieces !wah! #shiok# [sia]
actually we can two person share one [what] one person six piece six dollars okay [sia] right
ya so
maybe that that's an option but I will still rather #sedap# mania [ah] #sedap# mania you when you went that time they charge in terms of the plate pricing right <malay>kalau</malay> colour <malay>hijau</malay> then this price <malay>kalau</malay>

<malay>tak senonoh gitu</malay> [eh]
<malay>orang kasih</malay> assignment <malay>kita mengumpat</malay>
okay okay ya alright <malay>kita jadi</malay> serious (um) <malay>apa kita nak berbual</malay> [eh] (um)
<malay>kita boleh cakap pasal</malay>
(uh) <malay>kita punya keluarga</malay> or okay no [lah] no [lah] [ah] shares [lah] stock market [lah] [eh]
so (um) you <malay>ada</malay> any investment you you <malay>dah buat ke</malay> or anything you <malay>nak</malay> recommend
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
me ya
I I also don't know [lah] I I'm actually looking into the stock market also
but I <malay>tak tahu</malay> because <malay>sekarang nak beli</malay> tesla <malay>mahal tak mampu</malay> though
so
I think <malay>kalau</malay> I I will <malay>beli</malay> the stock (uh) for what I have now [lah] my capital <malay>yang ada</malay> I would probably invest in cheaper stocks [lah] singapore based stocks like
(uh) old #chang kee# for example (err) <malay>murah</malay> [jer] you <malay>tahu tak</malay> old #chang kee# <malay>dia punya</malay> share price is (err) <malay>enam puluh satu sen saje</malay> [tau] [ah] serious [a'ah] <malay>betul tu</malay> then <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada macam seratus ke dua ratus</malay> dollar then you <malay>akan</malay>
hold a lot of shares [tau] so I think
<malay>berbaloi</malay> [lah] then I I I mean [ah] I was looking at their annual report then old #chang kee# [kan]
<malay>dia orang akan</malay> open more outlets in more countries especially like in western countries where like <malay>macam</malay> the demand for asian foods are rising <malay>tapi</malay> supply <malay>tak banyak</malay>
so I would say maybe since they're are going to expand in region [kan] then <malay>agaknya</malay> I would think [lah] it's a good good good you know investment I would say some more they are like (um) they are singapore company so I would think
they won't grow so much but you can get money through dividend [lah] so I mean that's my thing [lah] cause <malay>sekarang</malay> I don't think I I <malay>boleh mampu</malay> [lah] tesla <malay>mahal saje</malay>
ya <malay>tapi itu</malay> my thing [lah] on stocks
<malay>tapi masalahnya</malay> some some stocks <malay>dia orang tak</malay> how to say <malay>dia orang tak syariah</malay> on client [tau] so <malay>nanti dia orang tak</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>kita tak boleh ambil dia punya</malay> (um) benefits [lah] from that stocks so ya I don't know [lah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>ni semua</malay> islamic financial [ah] you <malay>tahu tak</malay> anything about it
I see I see I see actually now that you say it [lah] that time I went for this (uh) website so they have this website online that they help with screen the stocks if the stocks are you get <malay>syariah pampasan</malay> or not
so it's very interesting because <malay>macam</malay> they will literally say like a tick or cross if it's (uh) allowed or not <malay>haram</malay> or halal [lah] in that sense <malay>tapi</malay> the problem with that website [ah] they very limited if you want to see more of like their ratings you <malay>kena bayar</malay>
then I'm like !alamak! then you muslim <malay>pun nak buat duit</malay>
<malay>nak tengok</malay> stocks halal <malay>ke tak</malay>
but I would say it's good [lah] like you know they give you like a listing and they helped you to screen up the stocks and and it's very <malay>macam</malay> you look at the platform very easy to understand so I'm like okay [lah] that there's very good especially sometimes because we think that the company might
be everything okay but then when you look at the screening process and they say actually cannot because in some sort they have like a subdivision debts investing in this like
but which is which might not be very halal link assets so
ya I think <malay>bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>kita sekarang</malay> (err) I would say the muslim world is getting very progressive [lah]
in that sense you know there's a lot of this kind of thingy
so ya <malay>bagus bagus bagus</malay>
ya (um)
you <malay>rasa</malay>
(um)
you <malay>rasa</malay>
good <malay>tak</malay> stocks
(mm)
I see I see
ya anyway (err) <malay>betul tu</malay> ya but I heard [kan] <malay>itu kalau</malay> you <malay>nak pakai wahed</malay> invest then
<malay>ada</malay> some fees involved right like <malay>apa tu</malay>
but how much [ah] the fees is it cheap to to put in money inside
(mm)
ya ya
(um) okay <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>nak bilang</malay> you [oh] ya anyway I I found out there is days
new (um) way
technically grow your money but with very low return [lah] so <malay>macam kalau</malay> you got some money to invest but you you are still looking for investment opportunity and you don't want to put the money in the bank let let's say you got two thousand dollars then you <malay>tak nak letak</malay> it in the bank [lah]
because firstly <malay>kalau</malay> you want to follow the islamic banking the you know the <malay>hibah tak banyak</malay>
so if you it an alternative is I was just looking at this it's called the money market fund so it's quite good because you invest like one thousand dollars in these funds right then it will technically a new <malay>saham</malay> returns <malay>tapi tak banyak</malay> the goal of this fund is to just preserve a capital when this ends so it's like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> it's like a savings account with a little bit more (uh)
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means <malay>dia orang tak</malay> invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means <malay>dia orang tak</malay> invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
so
wasted [lah] I think like a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> lot of banks they don't really know that bonds are <malay>tak</malay> halal
so
ya [lah] wasted <malay>kalau dia orang tak</malay> invest in bonds then <malay>kita dah boleh letak duit kat dalam</malay> [seh] if this can be our like primary savings account you know took up the money inside here
right [kan]
can [lah] <malay>nanti</malay> I call <malay>dia orang</malay>
ya [lah] I call [lah] I call [lah] I <malay>bilang</malay> [lah] <malay>kenapa ni</malay> right
that's true that's true
I I I think like the the notion of ethical investing is like getting more
gaining popularity [lah] because like you know (um)
[eh] not not sorry it's the international monetary fund right
they recently like two years back I think they they started to look at islamic finance and they are pushing forward [lah] for
for the idea of islamic finance because technically (um) you are being you are being very ethical with your investing and also <malay>macam</malay> in terms of risks right you are not passing so much risk towards their consumer so
that's why I think (err)
they are pushing it like especially in like the middle eastern countries so it's quite good but but unfortunately I feel like singapore <malay>macam</malay> not progressive yet in term of islamic finance
ya possibly because (um) even a lot of like muslim
people or other muslims they will still invest in
interest yielding accounts and maybe <malay>dia orang tak tahu</malay> [lah] it's <malay>haram</malay> because you would need to kind of know [mah] <malay>yang kita tak boleh yang</malay> interest and all bonds are <malay>tak</malay> halal I mean this is not like general knowledge so I think that's one thing you know education is important within the muslim community
ya <malay>kita terus</malay> deep [eh] <malay>berbual</malay>
ya ya ya <malay>betul betul betul</malay> I was looking at (um) the equivalent of bonds so called a interpreter islamic finance so I mean interesting [lah] because (uh) one good thing is our neighbour malaysia they are (err) they technically malaysia and indonesia they issue a lot of SOCOE so
(um) maybe there's one thing we can consider [lah]
so ya
SOCOE will be a good <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>pun macam tak faham sangat</malay> [lah] how how the SOCOE (um) investment works but halal [kan] <malay>dia</malay> [kan] so <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] [eh]
ya so
ya
[oh] <malay>kita punya</malay> trip [eh] [ah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] I I <malay>punya adik kejap</malay> [eh] I call my <malay>adik</malay> hello
<malay>adik</malay> I <malay>baru kentut adik</malay> I <malay>kentut adik</malay> I <malay>lepas ni nak kena</malay>
<malay>bau dia kuat</malay>
I <malay>tak tahu dia punya ada</malay> like a mix of a and I don't know <malay>dia makan apa tapi bau dia</malay> like one kind you know toxic toxic
<malay>kentut</malay> [ah] I think maybe yes [lah] <malay>dia nak</malay> eating [lah] agaknya rasa gitu</malay> [ah]
so (um)
ya ya <malay>itu</malay> I I I <malay>tu tak</malay> okay [ha] [ha] so anyway (um)
<malay>nak pergi makan</malay> I <malay>pun lapar sekarang belum makan</malay> so I <malay>pun nak pergi makan</malay> actually [kan] is #hafizah# going or not to #sedap# mania like what what do you think the chances are
(mm)
(mm) (mm) ya [lor] actually <malay>semua pun dah</malay> agree <malay>apa</malay> sunday <malay>semua</malay> okay
!aiyo! unless <malay>kita</malay> just go somewhere to like <malay>makan</malay> [lor]
then after that we just <malay>lepak</malay> then because you say she want a weekend actually we can do another day where we can have everyone work together then we can cycle and all right so if you want maybe today we can just go somewhere to like <malay>lepak</malay> and <malay>makan</malay> [lor]
I would think maybe #seletar# cafe will be good <malay>tapi sana makanan dia</malay> <malay>tak</malay> halal so <malay>mana kita boleh makan</malay> [oh] maybe we can eat at #seletar# airport the mister <malay>teh tarik</malay> express <malay>dia tu mahal ke</malay>
okay (um)
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> what are good things for us to <malay>makan</malay> [eh] (err)
I okay

[oh] [oh] your uncle was from there
so ya ya
ya so what did your uncle say though about about the block
it is it like your uncles or your friend like who is this person
[oh] distant [eh] <malay>jauh</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
[oh] okay okay
[oh]
<malay>nama dia</malay> Q
ya so <malay>macam mana</malay> you <malay>tahu ni</malay> Q <malay>tinggal kat</malay> #boon keng#
[oh]
<malay>takde bapa</malay>
I see I see ya I mean is is it because <malay>dia tinggal kat</malay> #boon keng# <malay>takde bapa ke tinggal</malay> #boon keng# <malay>pasal takde bapa</malay>
I I curious [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you know this kind of at risk areas what are the demographic of the people
[oh]
[oh] <malay>dengan datuk dia</malay>
<malay>tiba-tiba letak datuk</malay>
<malay>contohnya apa khabar</malay> [eh] are you close with the <malay>datuk</malay>
<malay>mak dia</malay> doctor <malay>apa</malay> though
like !wah! so I mean not bad [eh] <malay>walaupun dia tinggal</malay> at risk block <malay>mak dia</malay> doctor
<malay>kencang</malay> [seh] then <malay>kenapa mak dia doktor mak dia pun macam tak nak</malay> take her out you know
but ya ya this mom is specialising in what kind of medicine [ah]
I I'm wondering (uh) honestly curious
[oh] interesting [eh] psychology
[ah] psychology you <malay>pernah nampak tak dia punya dia punya mak</malay> I mean it will be very interesting you know to talk to her you know her antics and all
!wah!
very good very good I mean now nowadays they say you cannot specialized you need to generalize you know in your career
diversify [kan]
<malay>bagus bagus bagus</malay> very good
I actually now you speaking of which [ah] I think I met someone like this you know <malay>tak tahu orang sama ke</malay> this one this doctor like I'm talking about
that time I I was near the #boon keng# area then there was this doctor <malay>dan dia punya kucing</malay>
so I was like <malay>tapi dia tengah pakai</malay> white coat [lah] [eh] doctor <malay>dengan kucing</malay>
ya so maybe [lah] it's the it's the same person [lah] loves animal right
[ah] [a'ah] [lah] <malay>agaknya</malay> vet I mean we don't know [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> career <malay>banyak</malay>
a lot of careers ya
but I mean okay [lah] so <malay>maknya</malay> consider good [lah] doctor
good [lah] <malay>tapi anaknya</malay>
(um) I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I heard <malay>anak dia</malay>
[ah] I don't know how I heard [lah] where I heard [lah] <malay>agaknya kat</malay> mothership <malay>anak dia macam</malay>
<malay>apa seorang</malay> [ah] <malay>sampai</malay> or rather act a bit <malay>pelik</malay> you know
so I feel like if your mom is the psychologist then your daughter cannot be like that you know
maybe <malay>dia punya anak</malay> needs treatment [lah] like like do you think so
[oh] mother's gossip
[a'ah] [lah] <malay>agaknya</malay> [lah] however <malay>tak tahu</malay>
ya ya ya <malay>betul tu</malay> maybe what we can do is we can actually find this (um) Q your distant relative we can <malay>ajak</malay> her [lah] go <malay>makan</malay> [oh] maybe #sedap# mania you know I heard right although they are like you know in this kind of bad situation they got a lot money in their bank account you know
<malay>banyak banyak banyak banyak</malay>
<malay>duit</malay> so
<malay>lagi</malay> more reason [lah] <malay>takde</malay> [lah] <malay>takde</malay> [lah]
(uh) maybe we should help [lah] we should help please tell
like include them into our conversation because I mean to think about it ya well what you say is true [lah] if someone is put in that environment they kind of <malay>macam</malay> angry or you know whatever emotion it just gets bottled up because you <malay>takde</malay> you know outlet <malay>boleh keluarkan</malay> the <malay>perasaan</malay>
so in the end you know it's gonna eat her up internally [lah] [eh] <malay>macam mana</malay> her [eh] I [tau] eat him or her up like internally
so (um) it's important [lah] to seek medical treatment I say I mean twenty twenty now mental health is very important
so ya
they're not stigmatized [lah] in
(mm) [ah] <malay>kenapa ni</malay>
[ah] ya ya I I I redeem it I put it on nineteen as well which is this coming saturday [lah]
[ah] #sentosa# is it
that's how [ah] we've got twenty dollars worth of credits right
(um) #sentosa# I'm not sure because if we were to go for all the attractions and all that kind of cost a lot of money then you know the bungee jump <malay>itu</malay> I <malay>tak berani</malay>
so (um) #sentosa# maybe we can
picnic
I don't know cycle
we can
sit at the bar [ah]
you know we can just hang around at #sentosa# #sentosa# I think we can go to the
deeper deeper parts [lor]
[ah] yes yes maybe we can go there also over the fort #serapong# can just cycle there I don't think it's very far
it's like within the
tramp <malay>punya</malay> trail then we just <malay>macam</malay>
I'm not sure about the
whether it's legal or not
I would I would think these kind of place
they don't say [lah] they don't say illegal they don't say it's legal but then they will say if anything happens to you then
you cannot claim compensation [lah] because it's at your own risk [mah] you <malay>masuk tempat gitu</malay> so
ya but I think we just be very careful like you want to visit all of these places and I think now because we are in lock down and all there's nothing much we can do so
I think you know the COVID and the circumstances has pushed us to you know venture
find out all these spaces within our own country which is good [lah] cause <malay>kalau kalau tak</malay> then we wouldn't have even thought about this right so only you know interesting interesting
[oh] ya ya how much is it [ah]
I'm not too sure I really don't
[oh] ya we can do that also (uh) I think twenty dollar thing can get us about three right
(err) (um) can [lah] I mean
we we can go for the luge but luge is like
can also then luge <malay>macam laju</malay> [lah] a bit too fast don't you think so
ya as in [eh] as in the the timing also [lah]
I anytime if some more if it's on a saturday then I think will be best if we go
morning will be best <malay>tapi</malay>
we can go <malay>malam</malay> [lah] or we can go like in the evening <malay>macam</malay> cold [kan] <malay>begitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> sunset
<malay>dia tak panas sangat</malay> and ya
not <malay>pergi maghrib</malay> I mean
can also [lah] because okay if you want right because we get about twenty dollars but do we have do we have to book on the tickets in advance
(mm) okay okay then then good [lah] I would think of saturday <malay>banyak orang</malay> but it should be fine [lah] should be fine [lah]
I I <malay>sekarang tengah tengok harga</malay> per the hit rock <malay>mahal juga</malay>

[a'ah] [lah] <malay>laju sangat</malay> [ah]

at the haunted house [lah]
because I <malay>dekat tepi-tepi kadang-kadang ada dekat tepi-tepi</malay> there was this [one] <malay>yang dekat tempat tak ingat</malay> [lah] <malay>dekat tempat mana</malay> but it was it disguised itself himself herself as christmas tree <malay>habis aku</malay> [kan]

<malay>biadab</malay>
ya I'm not scared just shocked only
ya he was laughing <malay>pasal macam aku</malay> [kan] <malay>susah nak takutkan</malay> [a'ah] <malay>then tiba-tiba dia macam macam itu</malay>
then sis was like [oh]

<malay>apa benda</malay>
I don't know
sixty something <malay>sama</malay> [lah] <malay>aku rasa</malay>
ya and the
I wanted to go but I was
ya
but one of the scariest is <malay>aku punya kawan</malay> ya <malay>tak pun yang</malay> the <malay>kak pon</malay> clan and she also looked like <malay>kak pon</malay> [ah] that [one]
my friend I said my friend is one of the scariest she also looked like <malay>kak pon</malay>
[a'ah] she is one of the <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>kira kak pon punya</malay> scarers [lah] but she never <malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>dia tak cakap apa-apa pun</malay>
I don't know
[kan] I wanted to go [seh] because <malay>aku rasa</malay>
it
will scare the shit out of me [ah]
relatable
<malay>yang hari tu aku pergi pun</malay> the the year before <malay>aku pergi</malay> the only thing that scared me was the
<malay>macam</malay>
#sabah# <malay>dia orang macam buat</malay> #sabah# <malay>punya</malay> voodoo shit <malay>begitu</malay>
<malay>ya</malay> [lah]
[ah]
ya
<malay>dia</malay> no <malay>dia macam</malay> [ah] aborigine <malay>punya ni</malay> [ah] <malay>orang</malay> that <malay>apa tu</malay>
what is that called <malay>orang asli orang asli</malay>
[ah]
<malay>orang asli punya</malay>
so when I got out from there I got slightly freaked out [ah]
it's not really <malay>macam</malay> scary
<malay>aku suka</malay> [eh] <malay>benda begini</malay>
<malay>tak tahu tak ingat dekat mana</malay>
and I didn't let me think
[oh] ya ya ya but I can't remember when and where
sit
D marquee
I don't know
(mmhmm)
then
pretty groomer
was the coolest if not a normal cadres to eat
<malay>sikit hari aku macam aku tengok yang puaka tu</malay> [kan] and then they were like saying <malay>yang</malay> sis #huzairi# <malay>ni ada cerita pasal kawan dia nak cerita cerita-cerita hantu ni semua</malay> then suddenly <malay>dia punya kawan</malay> just kept quiet and then just say like I will tell you next time <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>lain hari</malay> [ah] then [ah] then they were like <malay>macam apa</malay> [seh] <malay>engkau tiba-tiba</malay> [ah] then <malay>sekali</malay> I think he texted or <malay>cakap</malay> [ah] the next time (err) or like call or something <malay>aku pun tak ingat</malay>
(mmhmm) <malay>dia dekat situ</malay> then <malay>dia cakap</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>dia balik</malay> [ah] then after that [ah] <malay>baru dia cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>tadi kita tengah cerita-cerita pasal tu banyak orang</malay> [kan]
ya
(mm)
<malay>habis</malay> [ah] then they say [lah] <malay>macam kadang-kadang kalau kita cerita-cerita benda begini macam benda macam</malay> it's like inviting the the thing then I'm like
(mm)
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
where got ghost where got ghost
there's no such thing as ghosts [what] there's only <malay>jin</malay>
I don't know [ah] because like <malay>macam hari tu aku tengok yang</malay> incredible tales <malay>tu</malay> [kan] they say their #ah kong# is there because they never burn the house
you know like chinese believe that they need to burn things like hell notes then [a'ah] for the departed then they just <malay>macam dia orang tak</malay> burn the house for him so he cannot he got nowhere to go because <malay>dekat tempat dia tak ada rumah</malay> so he went back to the house
no [lah] that's not the belief
the belief is the hell note is to bribe the guardians of the hell gates then ya that's what I heard [lah]
okay but I got this one question for you <malay>habis kalau</malay> if you are poor what even can you do
ya but you steal is
you steal is because you need to survive kind [tau]
it's not the worst sin [lah] but they believe that <malay>macam</malay>
ya [lah] but <malay>kalau kau bunuh diri sendiri pun</malay> it's not it's not a
you want to <malay>bunuh</malay> people with what [seh] I don't know you have don't have anything [what]
ya but at the point of time it's not <malay>kira dia macam</malay> you are not of sound mind [tau] at the point of time
ya but then that's the only <malay>kira macam</malay> that's the only sin [lah] [kan]
<malay>betul</malay> [lah] that's the only sin that's the only sin that you have
but if you rich then you got a lot of sin you need to bribe a lot that's right
but islam is very fair
<malay>tak juga</malay> no I mean like islam is fair because <malay>macam dia orang akan</malay>
<malay>akan timbang kau punya buruk dengan baik engkau</malay> and then after that if you have your <malay>buruk</malay> and then you will just go through all that you will be punished for all your <malay>buruk</malay> but then after that you will be given a chance to
ya let that's why you have to prepare yourself that's like another question
<malay>taubat</malay> [lah] that's why got
I asked this question during <malay>umrah</malay>
ya [lah] then that's why I say that's why that time I was in <malay>umrah</malay> then they they was talking about this [lah] like [ah] before we went to <malay>umrah</malay> we have like the course [kan] <malay>habis dia orang tanya</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay then <malay>bila kita zaman</malay> [ah] this <malay>ustaz macam</malay> rock rock <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>habis dia cakap</malay> then <malay>bila kita zaman</malay> time <malay>zaman</malay> rock <malay>kita pun terlepas solat</malay> then <malay>dia cakap kita buat apa yang kita mampu then kita solat taubat</malay> [lah] <malay>solat taubat</malay> then whatever that you can do like if you have extra time then you just pay back <malay>macam qada</malay> because you know you don't know how many
<malay>mana boleh</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
how would I know <malay>siapa kita nak</malay> judge that's why say at the end of the day you can only hear say all all of these kind of thing
but okay then there is the thing about <malay>orang yang kafir tapi dapat syurga</malay> just because <malay>dia kasi air dekat anjing tu</malay> so that's why I said like who are we to judge who are we to <malay>pertikaikan kita punya amalan</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>kalau aku pun aku bunuh</malay> [sia] <malay>aku nak taubat kau cakap macam itu kau kurang ajar apa</malay>
but he already <malay>bunuh</malay> the <malay>ustaz</malay>
[oh]
<malay>niat dia berjihad apa</malay>
ya [lah]
ya
ya [lah] that's why [kan] <malay>aku cakap nawaitu tu penting nawaitu tu penting</malay> sis [kan] <malay>aku dah cakap tadi tadi pagi tu jatuh niat nak maki</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi dah maki</malay> [lah] <malay>tu jangan nak macam nak cakap benda</malay> word this word is for another word but actually <malay>kau nak maki tu dah jatuh niat dah dah jatuh niat nak maki tu</malay>
(mm) <malay>maki</malay> [jer]
ya but they always say that the paradise is not for the good people it's for the sinners
who repent ya
that's why <malay>macam kalau kau macam niat kau nak solat pun tu kita dah dah dah dah</malay> plus point <malay>dah malaikat dah tulis dah</malay> [oh] <malay>dia nak solat</malay> [ah] <malay>dia terus nak pergi tak</malay> [oh] <malay>tak dia tak pergi tapi tak</malay> minus <malay>tapi dah dah jatuh niatnya</malay> ya then if <malay>kau nak buat jahat pun dia tak ada nak tulis macam nak</malay> [oh] <malay>nak buat jahat tak tulis sampai</malay> [lah] <malay>orang tu pergi dekat tempat tu</malay> and <malay>dia buat jahat</malay> then <malay>baru dia orang tulis</malay>
[kan] but I think all these all these people all these typical
people in our community makes it
it makes it <malay>macam susah untuk orang nak terima islam</malay> because
you guys are judgy bunch
like <malay>orang pergi masuk dalam masjid tak pakai tudung kau orang tengok atas bawah apa salahnya</malay> sister sister <malay>nak sembahyang pun</malay> sister <malay>nak solat kita buat</malay> [jer] <malay>yang wajib</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
[kan]
ya [lah]
doesn't mean like you don't wear your <malay>tudung</malay> your <malay>amalan</malay> is lesser than
that was the thing that was flying
<malay>yang</malay> spaghetti bolognese <malay>punya</malay> hook <malay>tu aku cakap apa tu yang</malay>
I don't know maybe
okay
okay I will see you in twenty twenty two
<malay>lepas tu aku rasa macam orang orang-orang ni semua</malay> I don't know how they educate their children and all
I mean I'm not saying that <malay>aku ni</malay> [ah] <malay>aku ni</malay> perfect but like I have ground rules of not judging people [lah]
ya man
okay
(mmhmm)
(mm)
but it's a it's typical [what] to do that
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh] sis <malay>lagi kena teruk</malay> everytime I wear <malay>tudung</malay> then people all like <malay>macam cakap aku ni macam-macam</malay>
it's not about step good good [ah] <malay>dia macam macam</malay> [ah] !alah! <malay>perempuan tudung ni semua</malay> you know the guys that I like get to know right they say <malay>macam perempuan tudung ni</malay>
[ah]
actually <malay>senang</malay> [jer]
[kan] then [ah] it's like you cover your head but you never cover your bottom
<malay>macam kira senang dapat</malay> [ah]
then I was like okay but not all of them are like that [what] like how right now I have the stigma of a single mother
[kan]
but
it doesn't matter [lah] I think it doesn't matter like what people think of us if it's just <malay>apa kita</malay>
how we react to that it shows
shows [ah] shows how we are as a person [ah] so I don't care [lah]
[kan]
(hmm)
be more proper
[kan]
ya
(mmhmm)
[kan]
like I think those kind of things so so <malay>macam</malay>
to certain people it will be like
<malay>mengghairahkan</malay> and
men are known to have like mental images and they keep
[ha]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
seriously
[oh] damn you weird
weirdo
<malay>siapa</malay> #nurul#
<malay>siapa</malay>
the <malay>cantik</malay> one
I don't know [lah] whatever [lah] then
!wow!
she what her display picture [ah] <malay>yang tunjuk muka dia pakai niqab</malay>
(hmm)
!wow!
should we do that like for our
like
gain popularity
for goodness
no I mean like <malay>macam</malay> you know we want to be we want to try to be influencers so why not like
(mmhmm)
[oh] man I can't do that
ya but that's another way for you to tone down your voice [what]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] sis more aware [ah]
but how to <malay>makan</malay> [ah] with <malay>niqab</malay> so you just open like that then <malay>makan</malay> I mean like ya ya [lah]
it's like a beat man
ya but then <malay>macam</malay> that's how people see you as a #hijabi# [ah] so when <malay>kau macam jatuhkan</malay> judgement <malay>dekat niqabi</malay> when orang <malay>jatuhkan</malay> judgement as
<malay>dekat kau</malay> as a #hijabi# then <malay>kau macam tak boleh terima</malay>
what [sia]
<malay>apa</malay>
but actually <malay>macam betul</malay> [lah] <malay>cuma pada aku macam kalau kau nak pakai niqab kau punya niat bukan untuk</malay> just to cover yourself but I think you need to have
<malay>ilmu</malay> [lah] <malay>kenapa kau nak pakai niqab</malay> so <malay>engkau punya</malay> journey
[a'ah]
so <malay>macam kau punya</malay> journey <malay>tak tersekat-sekat macam bila kita nak pakai tudung pun kita kena tahu</malay>
what to expect how to bring yourself
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
ya
[kan]
[kan]
is it the time for me to wear
<malay>dia macam</malay> there's an opening there's an opportunity there is it time for me to change and wear
[kan]
okay [lah] not really [lah]
[kan]
(mmhmm)
<malay>tapi macam</malay> okay speaking of this [eh] I was like thinking [tau] <malay>masa tu macam orang-orang yang pakai niqab ni semua semua macam</malay> very [ah] small sized you noticed or not they are very small sized and <malay>dia orang punya tulang</malay> is very small so like
sis is already is big it's not like I am
not say <malay>macam</malay> fat fat you know but it's like I'm already born big ya big build but then <malay>macam bila aku pakai</malay> [eh] <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> then I was saying this to #nek yam# you know then I was like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>habis nanti orang pakai habis macam</malay>
you know all these people <malay>macam pakai macam terletak</malay> [jer] then <malay>macam</malay> for me is like <malay>terletak</malay> and then <malay>tiba-tiba macam</malay> shoulder <malay>besar</malay>
and shoulder <malay>besar</malay> and then like then <malay>macam tergantung</malay> [ah] <malay>macam tergantung kita macam</malay> hanger so it's like it's not nice [ah] <malay>pada aku</malay> then after that #nek yam# said something that <malay>macam terus macam aku terus</malay> (ugh)
<malay>macam</malay> then she say you wear things you want to wear a <malay>niqab</malay> you want to wear to impress people or you want to wear because of #allah#
sis <malay>terus</malay> shut up [lah]
ya [lah] but doesn't mean <malay>kau</malay> presentable it
it doesn't have to do with yourself it just <malay>macam kau tak boleh</malay> change <malay>diri engkau</malay>
exactly that's why like you know sometimes and I'm I'm thinking like you know moving forward like what kind of clothes I would want to wear as a #hijabi# that
with big build or who is plus size or you know like for people who are bigger [lah]
ya that's why
(mm)
<malay>dapat</malay> sis looking at her
it's like looking
at myself like you know like I said to you at that time <malay>macam</malay> she became a basic
I don't want to say that word
#ringarde#
ya
but then <malay>macam</malay> but when you wear all these things you need to be slightly #ringarde# [lah]
because you are not supposed to stand out you are supposed to
be modest for yourself and for your creator
in <malay>dunia</malay> [lah] (mmhmm)
<malay>tapi macam kalau kau dah</malay> actually <malay>kau pakai hijab</malay> [jer] <malay>kau dah kena</malay> sacrifice all these things [seh] slowly [lah]

you know the same vibe
somehow but #rumi# is different #rumi# is
different what
it's just the <malay>pelik</malay> for me
I don't know [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay>
I think <malay>dia dah</malay> gonna get
engaged [eh] <malay>ke kahwin tak tahu</malay> [lah] cause <malay>dia</malay> I don't know <malay>aku selalu nampak dia</malay> on Instagram <malay>dengan</malay> this one indo girl
ya I know she's not local [lah] cause
in the video I think I got hear before <malay>dia berbual</malay> indo <malay>macam</malay> indo <malay>punya</malay> kind
so that time <malay>dia dengan</malay> dorothy together
and then <malay>dia punya</malay> Instagram is still <malay>dia dengan perempuan tu</malay>
I don't know [eh] but dorothy <malay>punya</malay> Instagram is different dorothy <malay>dengan dia</malay>
so I don't know [ah] <malay>apa</malay>
what kind of three way <malay>ke apa binatang</malay> it's called is going on with them it's just damn weird <malay>pelik</malay> also
then that time <malay>yang aku pergi tengok</malay> thai <malay>punya</malay> performance <malay>kat</malay> monti
then <malay>kita</malay> invite #rumi# also [lah] cause #rumi# <malay>cakap dia nak tengok</malay> like (um) drag performance those <malay>nya</malay> kind
and then <malay>banyak-banyak</malay> then
<malay>tertiba dia macam tak ada</malay> girlfriend
<malay>dia dia cakap dia</malay> single cause
know thai <malay>punya</malay> friends those gay friends keep asking [ah] like <malay>apa tu</malay> [oh] [ah] where's your girlfriend and stuff no girlfriend you single or what <malay>dorang macam nak menggatal</malay> [kan] then <malay>macam</malay> like
[oh] no [lah] I'm single and some more <malay>dia tengah</malay> in <malay>ke apa</malay>
but then <malay>dia punya</malay> Instagram <malay>masih ada</malay> the indo girl <malay>tu</malay>
and then just damn <malay>pelik</malay> [ah] [sia] and he host around with anything that moves
<malay>aku pun tak tahu aku</malay> just don't know [lah]
but I know #zul# <malay>tak</malay> comfortable <malay>dengan</malay> #rumi# also
they been friends for damn long [ah] but
#zul# <malay>pun</malay> petty <malay>nak mampus kau tahu dia cakap</malay> like I don't want to talk to #rumi# cause he never wish me happy birthday
<malay>macam apa kau merepek</malay> [eh]
ya apparently then <malay>aku macam</malay>
girl <malay>kalau aku lupa nak</malay> wish <malay>kau macam mana</malay> [eh] how [ah] and was like I probably won't talk to you [ah]
I <malay>tak faham</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak faham</malay> I think
justin also quite petty when it comes to birthday <malay>dia macam</malay> like <malay>dia cakap</malay> birthday is important [what] it's once a year what so hard
what's so hard about (um) wishing some happy birthday
then <malay>aku cakap</malay> like if you're not
in good terms with that person why you expecting that person to wish
it doesn't make sense wouldn't you be more boiled up then
than happy
[ah] <malay>aku tak faham</malay> [ah]
but #zul# know I know #zul# (um) <malay>tak</malay> comfortable cause of <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
<malay>apa tu namanya</malay>
(um) #rumi# I think #rumi# <malay>macam menggatal dengan dia</malay> also
(mm)
yes
unfortunately for his case [lah] but I think that time #zul# was with dylan <malay>dengan mata air dia</malay> [ah]
ya and then <malay>dia cakap</malay> like #rumi# [eh] #rumi# uncomfortable and then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> I know we are all closed <malay>kita</malay> very touchy also cause we hug a lot <malay>ni semua</malay> then
<malay>dia cakap</malay> #rumi# #rumi# does that [ah] but #rumi# <malay>macam</malay>
kind of
give the weird weird vibe
(mm)
you know when it's not touchy cause you are naturally touchy but
it's <malay>kau</malay>
<malay>nak menggatal</malay>
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [jer] [ah]
but #rumi# I've always seen as that way cause first time <malay>aku jumpa dia pun macam gitu</malay>
but first night is cool cause
<malay>kita semua minum</malay> [pe] together at sticky fingers
(ugh)
yes boss
(um) ya
but I like to see <malay>dia punya</malay> Instagram cause <malay>dia selalu pergi merayap makan</malay> and he eats good food
<malay>kat tempat</malay> the weirdest place
ya and <malay>dia ada</malay> motor I think
I think <malay>dia ada</malay> motor #vespa#
#vespa# <malay>dia macam ada</malay> shield <malay>macam</malay> that big ass shield <malay>kat depan</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> very <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> indie <malay>macam dia nak</malay> stand out from the rest
<malay>dia macam dia</malay> kind of mainstream but <malay>dia tak nak</malay> show <malay>yang dia</malay> mainstream so he gets something that is
a little mainstream but not so mainstream
<malay>macam kawan kau ni</malay> [ah] also <malay>macam</malay> motor <malay>tak banyak</malay> but actually people want that kind of bike
if it's a lot of people but
ya <malay>dia macam gitu</malay> [jer]
maybe [ah] the <malay>dorang</malay> just what one year apart [kan]
#afif# is what year
ninety nine #rumi# is ninety eight
(mm) #rumi# is #zul# age [ah]

good for what for iraq
we'll see [lah] we'll see <malay>kalau kau masuk</malay> army <malay>ke tak</malay> okay
petition for <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
of course [lah] <malay>dia nak</malay> standardise <malay>dia nya</malay> family
no cause that time I did remember I had a talk with your mum <malay>kat tempat</malay> the car wash <malay>kat</malay> then <malay>macam</malay> like
[oh] #baba lele# is then <malay>macam aku</malay> and then pop is police then <malay>aku macam</malay> like okay [what] <malay>kalau adik masuk</malay> at least <malay>dia belajar</malay> real life skills <malay>kalau tak masuk</malay> paramedic <malay>pun</malay> at least <malay>ada</malay> firefighter cause <malay>ada dua</malay> [jer] [pe] <malay>yang</malay>
hot spot <malay>nya</malay> vocation then <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>tak nak</malay> [ah] mama <malay>nak dia masuk</malay> army that's it

army [lah] cause <malay>kau dulu</malay> [pe]
ya so there are a lot of relatable things just that
<malay>aku rasa</malay> mama <malay>kau</malay> die die <malay>tak nak kau masuk</malay> police [lah] or just cause <malay>dia nak dia cakap dia nak dia punya</malay> son go through the

technically <malay>budak-budak sekarang dorang cakap ada</malay> choice [pe] <malay>apa benda</malay> before enlistment you can <malay>apa tu</malay> fill up the options and stuff then they will look through cause <malay>dorang cakap banyak orang</malay> depression <malay>cakap yang dorang kena campak</malay> to different organisation and then <malay>dorang</malay> suffer
instead of going through the proper life skill <malay>punya</malay> shit
(mm) ya
especially <malay>banyak orang</malay> complain [sia] <malay>aku tak faham aku</malay> that day <malay>pergi balik</malay> to my academy <malay>aku tengok</malay>

(mmhmm)
my wish [ah]
my wish
actually
<malay>anak-anak aku jadi anak yang baik</malay>
ya
be a good children
then
<malay>lagi apa</malay> [eh]
<malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>buka</malay> business <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>kita</malay>
that we work fishing prawn very very long time
(mm) ya
(uh) ya
I we went to many schools
schools and also
institute
(uh) then we find it
(err)
<malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>sewa itu agak tinggi juga sekolah sewa</malay> canteen <malay>itu murah</malay> [lah]
ya
the rent was very cheap just five dollars
per month yes
(uh) actually we can sell anything [lah] but except
except like we cannot sell deep fried items
<malay>tak boleh jual macam ayam goreng</malay>
(uh)
<malay>ikan goreng yang goreng-goreng itu tak boleh</malay>
<malay>kita kena kurangkan minyak</malay>
then we need to use less oil
and then we cannot sell junk food
like processed food
we cannot sell processed food like sausage and all those things
ya
(um)
ya [lah] <malay>tapi masalah dia</malay>
we cannot
no wait we need to look out for local peoples to work there
yes
so I I have to find the locals [lah] to work there
ya so
(err) <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>orang yang nak</malay>
<malay>bagi kita itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia dia sekarang dia tahu masak dia pandai masak</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau saya ambil alih</malay>
if I take over
I need to learn cooking so it's not that
you know
overnight thing I need to
learn
<malay>macam mana nak masak</malay>
ya
ya <malay>boleh masak</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
the the canteen sells malay food
muslim muslim
stall is a muslim stall
(um)
mostly is malay food like #mee soto# #mee rebus#
#nasi lemak#
and those kind of things [lah] <malay>macam nasi putih nasi</malay>
<malay>lauk-lauk</malay>
so
(err) <malay>jadi saya kena belajar masak dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>baru saya boleh buka</malay>
(mm)
<malay>sebab</malay> because at schools they have (err)
like quota like unique this stall need to be this kind of food
the other stall need to so this stall is basically for muslim malay food
so <malay>kita kena jual benda yang sama</malay>
ya
so (uh)
<malay>orang yang nak jual itu</malay>
canteen they they <malay>cakap</malay> they <malay>ada</malay>
business <malay>lain</malay> so <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia tak ada masa nak jaga dekat situ</malay> [lah] because
they need to standby there
it's the requirement the owner need to be there at all times at least one owner
so the the guy say
they don't have the time because they also need to look after other other business
then
belongs to them [lah]
ya
so <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>sekarang</malay> now we are
searching for the suitable space [lah] first
so everyday we are going out and finding if there is any
(err) good space to start small
ya
ya
my third wish
I would say everyone to be healthy
that's very important
ya
ya so
ya (mm)
because
I
<malay>saya tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa itu kalau tak ada</malay>
<malay>tak ada kesihatan itu</malay>
we cannot do anything in life
everything will be very difficult and miserable
ya
<malay>duit itu kita boleh cari tapi kalau kesihatan tak ada</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay>
ya
so in order to live a life we need
help
ya (mm) <malay>maksud saya yang</malay> my first wish <malay>yang anak-anak jadi baik itu</malay>
<malay>bukan baik</malay> I mean it's <malay>baik</malay> overall [lah] it's good
to the society good to the family
you know it's not there's just the kids
not just the children but also the
parents also need to be
nice to the children
you know
ya so <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>awak ada apa-apa awak boleh cakap dengan saya kalau saya boleh tolong</malay>
<malay>mana tahu</malay>
ya so it's best either you share everything [lah]
rather than you
just doing by yourself sometimes you get lost also
[ah]
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
so what I I can ask you
I ask you now what are your three wishes
ya
okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)

if if you are considering higher education <malay>mana awak nak belajar</malay> singapore <malay>ke</malay> overseas
okay
[oh] they have and all masters and all [ah]
you are of second approximate they all say something about how they send their students overseas for like
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
teaching
then
(um) but the same time you will also have a job right
I mean beside teaching
then you wanna take it as full time
ya
[eh]
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>mana boleh buat apa susah-susah belajar ini</malay> then go
<malay>ajar budak</malay> primary
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
me
ya
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>saya nak</malay> like I said
<malay>nak buka</malay> business
ya so
(uh) we are trying to find a suitable place do not want to jump
you know (err) take our time then
because now (err) when I study the market because of COVID
there's a lot of businesses are closing down
no business
so we need to be very careful when we invest
(uh) and not to invest too much
because we don't know what's the outcome
ya
<malay>kalau tak</malay> another option would be like <malay>macam</malay> work from home [lah]
like
[mah] do something like ecommerce <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>itu pun</malay>
it's all in the process
nothing [eh]
have
has my tedious life
(mm)
ya
so
what [lah]
(mm)
ya
free
<malay>dekat sini</malay>
[oh] there was (err) it's (err) healthcare
<malay>bukan tapi bukan untuk sakit yang</malay>
normal <malay>macam demam macam</malay> the normal you know cold flu things no I don't want that for free
<malay>tapi bila orang betul-betul sakit</malay>
(err) <malay>macam</malay> you know unexpected
so like like terminally ill or critically ill (uh) and there is no choice but to get a treatment
also it's very (uh)
you know (um)
<malay>mahal sangat</malay>
so let's
(err) <malay>bayangkan kalau orang itu tak ada duit</malay>
then <malay>memang orang itu dah</malay> stress because of the illness
ya so <malay>kalau dia tak ada duit</malay>
so that's going to
(um) make the recovery even
harder
ya so I wish
(um)
I wish [lah] if <malay>orang yang macam</malay>
[ah]
<malay>apa tak ada tak ada tak mampu untuk merawat</malay>
so they get I think government <malay>ada juga</malay> [lah] <malay>bagi untuk orang yang tak mampu tapi</malay> I wish they
ya I wish they get the best treatment also
[eh] common in what sense
you you mean the outpatient
ya
ya <malay>itu</malay> maybe we can
if not that
maybe we can afford
<malay>tapi yang macam</malay> chronically ill and the bill is like very high how
how we are going to afford
ya
(mm)
<malay>lagi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>nanti kena</malay>
master
[oh] okay
<malay>itu satu</malay> (err) swimming <malay>sebab sekarang saya tengah belajar</malay> swimming
<malay>berenang</malay>
(err) is with is with a private coach
<malay>dekat</malay>
(err) <malay>dekat itu</malay>
(err) <malay>apa</malay>
#yio chu kang#
#yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
ya <malay>sebab</malay> (err) coach <malay>itu boleh datang</malay>
(mm) <malay>dia punya tempat dia ajar itu dekat situ</malay>
ya I think #yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
(mm) ya
it's (err) four lessons
(mm)
(mm) four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coach is quite hands on [lah]
I mean (uh) last time <malay>saya pernah ada juga pergi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>dua tahun selepas</malay>
(err) I mean (uh) two years before two years ago
<malay>tapi</malay> coach <malay>itu walaupun</malay> <malay>dia bagi tiga ratus dollar untuk sepuluh</malay> lessons
<malay>tapi</malay> the coach is like (uh) not hands on he he
just a coach just expect us to do on our own (mm) but this one even though we pay four lessons hundred seventy seven <malay>tapi</malay> each lesson <malay>itu</malay>
it's very
meaning I mean very (err)
<malay>ada dia punya itu</malay> [lah] result
so (um) <malay>berenang itu</malay>
(uh) so I I I I think I need (err) more practice
but
I think with more practice I can master the skill [lah] but it will take time
for me
ya
<malay>lagi satu itu saya</malay>
because <malay>sekarang saya banyak sekarang saya umur empat puluh lima</malay>
so <malay>sekarang</malay>
like I feel like my body is like ache here ache ache there ache here you know
so I want
rather then I do I I I want to go for pilates
so it that one is actually not for weight loss
but is to correct your
posture
your you know like <malay>macam</malay>
alignment to make it
correct your alignment something like that ya
active
<malay>ada</malay> pilates
is it with the equipment
pilates
[ah]
(mm)
<malay>satu jam</malay> is it a group class
is it good
<malay>dekat mana</malay> #jurong#
ya <malay>yang ini</malay> pilates <malay>saya bukan cari yang</malay>
just
(err)
<malay>yang</malay> pilates <malay>itu ada banyak macam ada banyak jenis yang</malay>
<malay>ada yang buat</malay>
with our body just on the mat the yoga mat <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>tapi ada lagi yang pakai</malay> equipments
just (uh) designed for pilates which will help you to correct your
postures more
so I feel rather than
(um) the normal pilates I think I
I do this pilates [lah] I want to try but I haven't signed for the classes
ya
active <malay>itu saya kena</malay> check <malay>kalau dia orang ada</malay> the same kind of pilates
<malay>kalau ada</malay> (uh) ya obviously I go for that
because private ones I think is quite expensive
(mm)
(mm)
active <malay>belum</malay>
<malay>saya pernah pakai untuk</malay> swimming pool <malay>sahaja pernah</malay>
I mean the credit
no <malay>yang saya cakap itu dulu</malay>
<malay>dua tahun sebelum</malay>
<malay>itu dekat</malay> redhill
(uh)
delta delta
delta swimming pool
so far [lah] because the coach (um) <malay>yang</malay> coach can only come there
so we need to
it's not we decide when we want but the coach will decide which pool
ya like I said <malay>dulu punya</malay> coach <malay>itu</malay>
(um) I didn't learn anything from
the coach (uh) <malay>tapi sekarang punya</malay> coach <malay>itu</malay>
at least <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>ajar sikit-sikit</malay> but I know I would I will take with some
practice
I can master the skills but not too fast for me
(mm)
yes
<malay>sekarang saya punya itu</malay> package remain one more lessons only
then will compete
so if you want again you need to pay
(mmhmm)
ya
one dish
(mm)
I like bread toast
no
but I like bread toast [lah]
I don't mind
but (err) only the downside is that
(err) because it's all carbohydrates so I don't think I can eat
but if you if you ask me
no bread toast is just I like [lah] but not (mm) not I eat something that I eat rest of my life <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay>
(um)
I would rather go for something with proteins
like <malay>macam</malay>
chicken
or fish
ya I can eat that
from
ya with some fruits and veggies
<malay>kalau nak cakap macam gitu apa</malay> [eh]
[ah] <malay>saya tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>awak</malay>
ya
maggi <malay>mee</malay>
(uh)
ya
fried rice
[oh] #mee hoon# #tom yum#
okay
[ah]
okay
so how was the rice today (uh) the #mandi# rice
the <malay>nasi</malay> arab <malay>itu</malay>
ya smoke <malay>sebab</malay> smoke <malay>itu tak kuat</malay> smoke
the smoke is just like only on the surface
then it will you know <malay>dia akan hilang cepat</malay>
ya
<malay>itu bukan keras</malay> [lah] <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>bawah itu yang dah rangup</malay>
<malay>nasi yang dah</malay>
curry
(hmm)
ya <malay>tak tak tapi</malay>
I like it very much the rice
for me it's like
one of the best (um) #mandi# rice I cooked so far
no I did before with the whole chicken
ya
no for me this was this this is more flavourful
than the previous one
(mm)
okay
(mm)
pizza <malay>dekat mana</malay>
pizza hut
!hey! which pizza you ate [ah]
half half
half half you can order like that
is this the same price
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(err) tomorrow bought probably will be
no
probably will be
chicken curry
ya why not and #ghee# rice is very simple to make
very easy to make
it's very easy [lah]
(err) you need a little bit of <malay>minyak sapi</malay>
(err) depends [lah] if you want to put it all <malay>minyak sapi</malay> or you can mix with other oils like any other vegetable oil half half
let's say you take (err) one cup of rice
any cups [lah]
I'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take (um) you can make it with the #basmati# rice
or you like the small small rice
okay you you measure one cup of rice
then you (err) if let's say one cup of rice (uh) you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of #ghee#
you put the #ghee#
then you slice like one medium size onion
(um) but the onion you should you should slice (err) very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy
so once it's like
(err) translucent like a bit brown then you put
you <malay>boleh</malay> you <malay>boleh letak rempah-rempah dia</malay> like <malay>kayu manis buah pelaga</malay> is
(err) what is the name in english (uh)
<malay>bunga lawa tapi jangan taruh banyak</malay> [lah] because it's only one cup of rice
so just one one will do one small piece of
<malay>kayu manis</malay>
<malay>buah pelaga satu cukup</malay>
then <malay>cengkih</malay> is clove
then
ya that's all [lah] if you have
<malay>macam daun salam</malay> is basil leaves basil leaves also can put one
then you [dah] fry then you you take one cup of rice
put one and a half cup of
water then when it starts to boil you put
(err) you <malay>letak garam</malay>
(err) according to your taste [lah]
<malay>garam</malay> then when it when the
water starts to boil you <malay>letak itu beras</malay>
then you cook [lah] rice cooker
ya
that's the simple version [lah] there's many kind of
(err) <malay>nasi minyak</malay> you are talking about <malay>nasi minyak</malay> right
(uh) <malay>nasi minyak kalau ikutkan cara sini</malay>
<malay>dia</malay>
<malay>ada letak</malay>
instead of (uh) instead of
all water they will mix with half half like <malay>susu cair</malay>
half <malay>susu cair</malay> half water
so what's that one and a half cup right
no <malay>nasi lemak kita letak santan</malay>
this is <malay>nasi minyak</malay>
ya <malay>nasi minyak</malay> you can also do that way but the taste will be a bit [lah]
(mm) then you <malay>boleh letak daun pandan daun serai</malay>
you know that one is a different taste but if you like it you can do that way also <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>boleh letak</malay> tomato
(uh)
you (uh) <malay>boleh letak</malay> chilli <malay>hijau semua</malay> [lah] then you put half half [lah] <malay>separuh</malay>
<malay>separuh susu cair</malay>
<malay>jadi tiga suku tiga suku</malay>
(uh) then the same method you put the (uh) <malay>garam</malay>
then you put the rice
the other one the taste will be <malay>macam kenduri punya nasi lemak</malay> [lah]
[ah]
ya
ya that one is more like (uh) is (uh) more with it goes well with like <malay>macam ayam masak merah rendang semua</malay>
ya <malay>ini nasi minyak</malay> simple <malay>punya</malay> so it goes well with (uh) curry chicken
ya curry chicken [lah] the best with potatoes
(mm)
can
no [oh] it's it's
it's easy to make
you then you can try to make tomorrow
I already to

[ah] onion that's all then the rest
ya you can use the rice cooker
ya so you try to make it so maybe you can <malay>kau boleh masak dekat sekolah</malay>

the
pot [lah] the there is a pot call multi

(mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> one of the <malay>macam</malay>
rules about keeping your like bags in everything is to not hang it
so ya
<malay>tapi</malay> no [lah] I mean I'll get a shelf for it or something [lah] for my bags or something
ya cause I was just looking at actually yes speaking talking about that I was just looking at like how to store my back properly
looking at how to store my bags properly
because I remember reading before <malay>dia orang kata</malay> can just keep
(um) can just keep in the box you know keep in a dry place
keep in a box the original [ah] in the dust bag the box and then at a dry place
but then so I thought cause my bags now are in their zips <malay>dekat dia orang punya</malay> zips covered [kan] in in like its original packaging <malay>kita tak buka</malay> so it's all just there <malay>abeh kita takut</malay> [ah] okay so I thought was safe
<malay>abeh</malay> I followed his wife <malay>macam</malay> a luxury person [lah] okay on instagram <malay>abeh dia ada macam</malay> Q&A session <malay>gitu</malay> sometimes <malay>abeh dia punya</malay> one of <malay>dia punya itu</malay> is (um) don't keep it in the original box like take it out it needs to breathe sometimes sometime <malay>abeh</malay> if you keep it for inside for too long then because it's leather and everything right then (um) the humidity and also whatever whatever
okay but I don't know and I've kept like this one bag has
been in their zip in the cupboard
since like august
ya so so I'm worried about it <malay>tapi kalau</malay> if I ask him to <malay>keluarkan</malay>
then <malay>tak</malay> [oh] my god <malay>tapi</malay> that time <malay>itu saya tengah</malay> because <malay>saya beli banyak benda</malay> [kan] then I just have this small section in the cupboard now because <malay>kakak dia belum keluarkan</malay> her clothes
so in that so <malay>ada</malay> a small section where I can put the stuff [lah] <malay>abeh</malay>
you know <malay>bila macam nak</malay> unboxing or whatever right you want to keep like the the boxes and the the the bags you know what is it called the the yellow bag [ah] <malay>macam</malay> all nice <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] so !woohoo! open it up
so okay you need to carefully place everything
(um) so that they can all fit nicely
and then like (um) without crumpling or whatever [lah]
then <malay>tak</malay> enough space [tau] so long as it can I can you <malay>gerakkan</malay> your <malay>tempat baju sikit</malay> so that I can more space <malay>lepas itu dia</malay> how why you just <malay>taruh dekat atas</malay> [lah] then no <malay>nanti</malay> crumple so what it's just a bag case so the thing is <malay>kalau kak suruh dia</malay> like can you <malay>keluarkan</malay> this bag just to check the bag I already know how's he handle he's going to handle the bag
<malay>nanti dia</malay> just <malay>macam campak</malay> or whatever <malay>nanti semua</malay> like I don't know <malay>nanti macam</malay> crumpled or whatever because he just doesn't care for this and ya
so that's why <malay>macam</malay> [oh] if I want to check ya probably like check then I have to I have to go there myself
and like check on the bag but the thing is now <malay>kak punya kerja</malay> like
I don't want to the days that I have off
I always say I don't want to do anything
just <malay>nak duduk rumah</malay> ya
ya I thought of that also
(um) because now <malay>dia</malay> apple boy he got a macbook
we can face time phone we are waiting for our contract to end
then when your contract ends <malay>kita sama tak</malay> mine is on february
<malay>tapi</malay> yours is the same <malay>kita sama</malay> plan [kan] <malay>ada abah</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
then when did we get ours
[oh]
okay ya so this was before ours for ours you got yours or ours okay then then ya but anyway I think <malay>dia punya pun</malay> end at like end of the year or something like that then probably we'll change to iphone [ah]
where did you change
he hasn't been using a laptop for awhile
ya then <malay>macam</malay> all the other laptops <malay>macam</malay> will
die faster or something [lah] something to start then cause I told him that my macbook has
can survive like freaking seven or eight years or something
[ah] then <malay>macam</malay> not bad [ah] then like ya <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> all the food that <malay>abah simpan masih boleh masih boleh pakai</malay> [seh]
then <malay>dia</malay> okay [lah] then <malay>dia</malay> ya
ya so
they say that
no I just thought <malay>macam</malay>
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I <malay>tahu macam</malay> when I hear <malay>macam</malay> the [oh] the android versus apple whatever <malay>macam</malay> android <malay>punya</malay> argument <malay>macam</malay> their specs is better
like technically like technically it's better or something I don't know but anyway the font is ugly and that's all ya

suited switches waited until like someone call him to
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
your max [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
ya [lor] in my opinion also I feel like
(err) patients especially like those like <malay>tua tua</malay> ones they're quite entitled that's why they feel they're like ya
ya
[ah] [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah] (uh huh) (uh huh) (uh huh)
okay [lah] but if you're working in this sector you need to expect this kind of people also
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
what parents
I mean I'm quite lucky [lah] right now they my my my tuition centre the parents are all quite okay not really those demanding ya they're all chill
but I mean I mean they're bound to face this kind of
bad parents also but I think overall is okay like
what I want I wouldn't complain anything about it [lah] everything is everything is #gucci#
ya ya
so what you're planning to do for your full time now
(mm) (mm) (mm)
course you <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
[ah]
(mm) <malay>habis</malay>
what kind of careers can you like get from this course though
freelance is it
[oh] cool okay
which
[ah] which company
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) [oh] ya but during your course of study got intern or not [ah]
so (mm)
is that related to your course though
[ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
your cup of tea
(mm)
[ah] (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) [oh] the standards is not very high there
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
words (mmhmm)
(mm)
doing (mmhmm)
but I feel like singapore these kind of things is not very exposed like media things going on so like a bit hard [lah] for you right
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) understand understand
ya as for myself also like after I graduate there was no graduation and then wanted to find a full time job also like very <malay>susah</malay> nowadays very very <malay>susah</malay> to find now [ah]
full time jobs and then as you were saying regarding like not what you want but more to survival yes
ya take whatever there is (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
culinary
ya <malay>masak masak</malay>
(mm)
ya that's true
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(uh huh)
ya it's true (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya that's true <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
[ah] but from this situation also like a lot of thing was affected like we can't even like travel anymore or like go to concerts and stuff like that and I don't even know when will we
ya partly [oh] my god ya I feel like it affected us especially us youngsters [ah] <malay>budak budak sekarang</malay>
fun things like what
(mm) ya
(mm) [oh] ya all these are all affected
even our <malay>hari raya</malay> visiting is like affected ya
(mm)
and to see but the
how to sit and apple
ya
mentally physically
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
but also depends on each person [lah] because like some people are like you know they're the extroverts and
introverts but then the introverts will like appreciate this point of time because of like they all just have to like constantly stay home and not have to like meet other people
bad for us mostly to the extroverted side that [one] can affect us like a lot
(err) yes but I feel like I've changed honestly I mean I told people that I'm an extrovert but then like the other time I took the test like I've changed
I mean I'm still an extrovert but some factors changed so I mean I don't know if like it's possible for our personality to change like that
I don't know I feel like cannot wait so from what
you're still extroverted right
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya
(mm)
(mm)
like I feel I feel like as we age [ah] and then we find ourselves to like keep
we find to keep to ourselves more not as much as we did like last time when we were younger
and then like we appreciate our alone time more instead of like going out constantly I mean going out with friends (uh) <malay>macam</malay> time to time okay [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> like
ya sometimes it gets draining so we need like time for ourselves like for awhile maybe one or two days then after that we can go out again
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) ya I understand
(mm) (hmm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
but right now I feel like we are slowly getting back to how we were last time though
like crowds are not so crowded but people are coming out more roads are getting slightly busier and stuff like that so I think
it's quite of a slow moving but we are still going back to our way [lah] but it's just slow
(mm) (mm) (mm) [oh] my god ya
everytime I see such videos I feel very blessed to be in singapore honestly but then like you know cannot put my guard down also cause we don't know what might happen anywhere
(mm)
(mm) our blessings
(mm) (mm) (mm) ya
ya ya ya
(mm) (mm) (mm)
so we have some parties who are willing to talk about the minorities right (mm) (mm) (mm)
a change [lah]
progress
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
close minded [lah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
I think I uses an enormous
such matters
but I feel like when I go online I mean when I go online I see like people are quite vogue [ah] about all these matters but then come to come to think of it social media is most likely just like the youngsters
my our generation but then like still singapore is mostly made up of the older generation also who are still stuck in this kind of like mindset
so and then it's they make up most of the people in singapore I mean
overall then still singapore is still considered quite close minded and traditional [lah] due to some of their thinking those are their thinking
but then like you know I see social media all then like all the youngsters all that [one] is like
they quite okay quite woke but then like you know it's still just a small what percentage of singaporeans ya
(mm) (mm)
thinking
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
but I'm glad that some of the percentage of the votings for the elections was also
made up of younger generations so that [one] actually like kind of assured me
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)

<malay>tahu satu sama lain ya</malay>

(uh huh)
then
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but in school you use the school stick [ah]
but for competitions do they provide sticks or
[oh] so in the end you still bought [lah]
class fund
[oh] [eh] [ah]
edusave [eh]
[ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
so you prioritise the (uh)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
so your for your school floorball was it an all girls or mixed
[oh] there's two floorball teams
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] so you improved a lot [ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
why though
looking be scared probably isn't it
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
did they like dislike you
hatred [ah] [oh] acceptance from that
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
to join you [lah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
for me I I tend to like you know get myself into like
this kind of things [lah] like if I see your personality is like something that would bring drama to my life I'll be like
okay I'll just like you know distance myself from you
so like for me drama is like really I don't really face dramas [ah]
ya like even okay the most I've ever had drama in my life was
poly but I it's not me it's like people in the class I wasn't involved at all the people was in the class
and then like they were talking about it I mean I hear people talk about it but I'm just like
okay you know like whatever let go I'm the type to like if you don't do shit to me then I'm okay with you ya
as long no matter what people say about you [ah] so as long as you treat me right then I'm okay [lah] so like I mean
that's how I feel like I came with like a no drama life ya
it's not even me drama is like my class drama you know that kind of thing
and then the class drama and then they all talk about it that's why I can got to know about it [what]
if people don't talk about it I don't think I will even know about it
(mm)
the floorball is it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I think that's what happens when you put a lot of girls in one place
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
get through with it
(uh huh) [ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] so you guys were sort of like the junior team is it
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
[oh] math was the only one you failed
but
[oh] okay
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
so neat
so did you like ever thought of like continuing your floorball things in poly
really I never hear [sia]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
[oh] okay
life skill
I feel like sports is like you have to have a passion for it [lah] if not it's like really tiring for you
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] floorball
that is going to affect your grade more [sia]
exams
[oh] my god O-level
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
but I feel like sports also especially floorball in singapore it's not really a (um)
really
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
really
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I mean it doesn't as someone who's not very involved in sports I I never hear like
I mean person as someone who's not very involved in sports I mean I never hear like
floorball before [lah] in singapore [ah] like a popular way
weird why
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
[ah] [oh] ya
[oh] ya we had the camp
!huh!
really
this the first time I ever heard someone say I look like a <malay>minah</malay>
vibes [ah]
(mm) (mm)
but I think we achieved quite
a lot [lah] from our time there
which one the flower
I don't remember [sia]
[oh] the <malay>dinding</malay> [eh]
(mm) ya ya ya
I think for me I think I've a lot of ideas in my head [ah] but I think executing part [ah]
that [one] is not for me [ah]
that's true
(mm)
I feel like also like we all as organisers we have other commitments also
and then like it's not necessary we're not full on committed to this role of ours
and then I think that's one of our flaw [lah]

tertiary is what secondary [ah]
[oh] primary secondary or poly [ah]
for me I think okay the most time I enjoyed will be
primary school but then the thing is like primary school I was like really young so I didn't have any like
quite a good memory of it <malay>tak ingat</malay> [lah] then after that like but then
secondary school wasn't really good for me poly also
poly was #aite# but I wouldn't say it's very good also
ya so I don't think my education was a kind of a fun time for me [lah]
so I would choose the primary school [lah] cause like it's the most
unproblematic ya
anyway let me tell you all about my school life
so for primary school right I was from #ahmad ibrahim# at #yishun#
and my mum was a <malay>cikgu</malay> there she was a teacher there also
so it was like a kind of fun thing because like you know like if you no money or what just go staff room
and then like but I was
in #ahmad ibrahim# for just three years like primary one to primary three
and then after that (uh) I moved to #serangoon# so I had to transfer myself so I went to #pei hwa# at #sengkang#
so that was when I had like
so [eh] no #pei hwa# was secondary school sorry I went to anchorgreen primary at #sengkang#
so that was where [oh] wait I haven't with you yet so I'm at #ahmad ibrahim# right I joined
(err) skipping rope skipping
and ya it's a rope skipping and I was unexpectedly amazing at it
like I was quite popular in primary school just for being like the top rope skipper
like I don't know why but like our sports day there is like even a rope skipping sector for it
like is like you either rope skip the fastest or like you like
run while skipping that kind and like
is and I always win first no matter what level is that
and like I don't know why like I found my talent there [ah] and then we joined like skipping competitions like
even though I was in primary three only I already knew how to like you know the double double skip that [one] and then like
as someone who's like super short is like quite unexpected for me to be good in this kind of sport [lah]
and then considering I did it although it was just three years I
thought I would grow but I never
but rope skipping is
jumping [eh] so I most of the time jumping but I don't know why I never grow [lah]
but anyway I managed to join in my three years there I managed to join one competition
which I don't really remember what how we did cause it was like really super long time but I remember like rope skipping in front of a lot of people
and then like
I was with like the seniors and shit and then like everyone was kind of tall there but I don't remember seeing locals it's most of the time like foreigners
but I think I did
I think I did quite a good position at the
the time for the fastest skipper [ah] that [one]
I think I got I think I did quite for that but I really don't remember how it went [ah]
[ah] I think so
I think so but I really forget [sia] I forget I just remember skipping super fast I was like
and then after that (err) okay that's all then my primary school was
(err) skipping [lah] then after that I went to anchorgreen #sengkang#
and then that's at #sengkang# and then there I joined dance
dance ya join and dance but I did chinese dance but surprisingly until now I still cannot do a split
[ah]
[ah] no we have three types of dances all
[ah] we have like modern dance we have chinese I don't know why but I was put into the chinese dance ya
and then there's like those things and stuff and so unexpectedly I didn't expect myself to be an okay dancer also so from primary school I got
an interest in dancing [lah] so that's when I like find out myself about dancing and stuff
so ya primary school was one of the most memorable ones [one] I would say
like no problems at all no dramas and shit and like everyone's just like
vibing so
<malay>tak tak</malay> dance no
(uh) I enjoy dancing but I mean just for fun [lor] I mean sometimes I just like you know <malay>jumpa kawan</malay> dance that's all and like ya that's it
[ah] ya [lah] those [lah] ya just for fun
!huh! really I feel so shy <malay>malu</malay>
really
from what like
just like interest (uh huh)
personally I feel free styling is like
hard [sia] for me
(mm) (mm)
because it's up to you also [what] right ya
okay
[ah]
(err) for me I don't know [eh] I feel like those
type of things you know there's like contemporary and shit for me I don't understand [eh] this kind of dance like I don't
see it being nice it's just like people moving around the body is not I mean it's like ya I mean it's like
[ah]
(uh) I think I don't know [ah] I mean if like one person do on her own [ah] I don't really enjoy it
but if like many people that kind then it's okay [ah]
but for me I don't understand contemporary and urban urban [lah] like
I don't understand the nice to it [lah] hip hop that's like that's like nice [ah] I feel like that's nice ya
but like contemporary I don't understand personally I don't understand
I don't appreciate ya
okay so after primary school secondary school secondary school I joined ODEC
outdoor adventure club
so from there I gained a lot of experiences like I went rock climbing dragon boating
and then I joined like competitions where you know like those triathlon kind of thing where you cycle and then you run and then
then after that I got rock climbing kayaking dragon boating
[oh] I even joined a kayaking (uh) competition
and ya in
#polys# [ah] I mean organised it
but it was secondary school (err) but the girls managed to got third I think
and the guys I think got second so it was quite a
it's quite (err) like an achievement for us [ah]
because we didn't expect to win at all and it was just like a side thing for our
like you know it's not our kayaking it's like outdoor ya outdoor adventure club not
kayaking so it's not our forte kind of thing ya then after that (err) then we got
kayaking and stuff [oh] there was rock climbing as well
so there's like a level one cert level two cert and stuff so we got a level one and then we got like
so normally when we did
is normally with
so sometimes when do things we'll also do things [ah] like those like
(err) camps and shit and stuff is normally with [eh] so like ODEC also mostly was boys
so and then like sec four us as the seniors there's only three girls
and everyone was guys and considering with so everyone was guys
and there's only three girls so it was like I mean
for me I feel it was okay [lah] cause we managed to like I mean
the girls and I we have like those we're not very feminine also
so we're like ya so we're okay
so everything was like unproblematic but like
(err) secondary school I didn't really enjoy because my teachers weren't very good
teachers [ah] I would say ya they're they're not very good at teaching and I don't see like kindness in them also only some
but then like my form teachers and stuff like [meh] so I don't
ya so I didn't really enjoy secondary school and then came to poly the somehow I
got into culinary then after that
culinary (um) <malay>belajar</malay> I mean okay [lah] actually I joined this course because like there was a part where they talked about barista
then I like [ah] ice cream ice cream coffee coffee <malay>gitu</malay> then after that
[oh] ya I work at Starbucks before but I so like ya I learn
I learn I learnt like latte art from there and stuff but then like surprising unfortunately
this course the coffee part is like only one part ya
so most of the thing was like in kitchen and shit which I don't really enjoy so I ended up not really enjoying this course [lah]
and like then ya somehow then after that like although like we did like kitchen practices and stuff but
kitchen really stressful [lah] the the environment the the environment very stressful and then there was like wine tasting
it's kind of it's kind of cool but [meh] not my cup of tea
and then somehow I
got through it so here I am now as a tuition centre admin
but I feel like I got most experiences from like my primary school or secondary school [lah]
poly like not really [eh] maybe just like smart asia but
that was fun but
nothing much for me [lah] ya
(mm) actually I did [ah] but I feel like my
I feel like my not good enough
but you want to go poly <malay>nak pergi</malay> poly [eh] uni sorry
(mm) there's no design [meh]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
!wow! okay (mm) okay okay okay okay
I didn't know (uh) (uh) media is like so enhanced like so many things
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
what's for you though what's the one that you are good in
creative director what's that
(mm)
[oh] like you the posters and stuff [lah]
[ah]
[oh] [oh] cool cool cool
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
is up to you
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
then you should like work for like those (mm) shops maybe like online shops you can work as their like
like social media kind of thing [what] no [meh]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) then you should open a YouTube channel
why
(mm) (mm)
ya that's true you need to like stand out and stuff
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya I also just realised that [sia]
culinary was really just because of the coffee part [lah] really
actually [ah] if I'm not culinary I don't know what other course I would choose though I really cannot I really don't know [eh] honestly
I mean for you media media I don't see myself in media also but maybe I can do it like
I mean for me I'm someone like can adapt
right I mean that time my I design the poster also right
I don't know [sia]
ya I feel like I mean I'm that's why I say that can adapt to any like any places [lah] [hor]
that's what I'd say
ya true
cannot decide [ah]
ya I think that's what everyone's problem now [ah] they don't know what's their main
pro
ya you know jack of all trades
ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya
but I feel like that's what everyone says [eh] like (err) experiences over grades but then now I feel like if you have a poly student who's
like (uh) signing up for this job and you have a uni student but signing up for this job the uni student is always going to get it instead of the poly you know
ya can adapt better but I think they will hire the the uni [one] honestly
so I don't know [lah] so I don't when everyone says
ya
your grade not good enough
ya exactly
ya so we're caught up
so
!wow!
<malay>bodoh</malay>
I thought it was a legit quote LOL
I think that's kind of partly true though
but one thing I'd say is like on your quote is like (err) capitalism like how like how celebrities do very minimal
to get like a lot of amount of money and there are people out there who are working super hard but they are still earning
like the bare bare minimum
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) ya that's true
ya
and it's sad
<malay>betul</malay>
ya
ya life in a nutshell or what it's so sad
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
I think you know what they say about the red red <malay>mata merah</malay> is it
ya like people cannot see you enjoy things
I mean like there's always bound to have someone who will be unhappy with your achievements
and stuff like that so ya
ya
ya !huh!
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
like a <malay>kefahaman</malay> [ah]
(mm) ya
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but I think that's what makes up a person [ah] a person will not have only good sides in him there are bound to have ugly sides in a person also
but then just some people has more ugly sides than good sides in them
(mm) (mm)
[ah] we just don't know what happen behind closed doors
that's true

(uh huh)
[ah] yes correct correct
(mmhmm)
ya
<malay>abeh</malay>
how how does how does it work
in the new (uh) version
okay
(mm) (mm)
so
so basically all the tactics are all
your your choice [ah] there's no (uh) you can you can choose whatever tactics you you you run and you can (err)
do according to your preferences [ah]
[ah] okay so there's no like
four four two
(mm)
(mm)
so in order for me to play
for example #tiki-taka# I cannot have a
(uh) anyhow
five four one kind of formation I have to make sure my (uh) my formation is flick enough for the #tiki-taka# or
in other formation #gegenpress# [ah] so <malay>tak boleh</malay> just <malay>sembarangan</malay> [ah] <malay>ni</malay>
but okay so once I got the tactics done
is there what's that called the does does the player make a difference [ah] like there is there a player for example shadow striker
so there's a predefined for who can play what [lah]
so for the
players also
(mm)
is there like
they have a preference of what tactics and and (uh)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay
[ah] okay okay okay so
they have their own (uh) attitude [lah] and (uh) they have their own attitude when facing the
[ah] each games [ah]
the what what clubs other than the english premier league <malay>tak ada</malay> logo
(mm)
I I heard I heard that there's a new league right denmark is it
[ah]
so so <malay>apa</malay> (uh) what what what club are you planning to manage
if I'm not wrong [eh] (uh) the last
on <malay>aku main</malay> is that time time poly is sixteen
that's that's long [sia]
I was I was I don't know why but I was thinking last year [sia] last year or last two years
so I [eh] correct correct two thousand sixteen
it will be [ah] fifteen
so it's in
one
so the last time I play I play was sixteen
but okay anyway okay before before before I consider playing twenty you think twenty one coming soon or not
[oh] the the twenty is free
is not a trial or anything
it's a full game for free
[ah] ya
[oh] I didn't know it was free
okay
okay okay so maybe later I will later I will plug in the laptop and check it out [ah] so if okay if I am going to download it
[ah] before download it your <malay>kau nya</malay> laptop <malay>macam mana</malay> like what is the specifications cause <malay>aku tak nak</malay>
[ah]
okay
which <malay>apa</malay> brand [ah]
Acer (uh) you got you got remember what it's a A what
A two nine five okay that [one] I think I quite lost already
[ah] K so
there is you got what N N V I D A
NVIDIA (uh) have <malay>semua semua</malay> all have [ah]
okay [lah] so that means it will be quite smooth I don't know whether my
laptop <malay>boleh pakai ke tak untuk</malay>
[ah] okay
okay
F sixteen and twenty might have a drastic improvement I think there is a drastic improvement
[ah]
ya I know I know I know
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
apparently okay for for for for storage data I have a lot <malay>memang ada banyak</malay> [lah]
I have [ah] eight hundred gig plus free ya but the thing
the thing
is the thing is I don't know how will it be smooth [ah]
I don't want jagged jagged (uh) you know what I'm trying to say right there's there's a
the not seamless enough
[ah]
[ah]
ya hopefully
but wasted the twenty is not under epic for switch
cause switch also (uh) got twenty touch
[lah] <malay>ini</malay> what's the difference I don't know touch is just for anything that is not computer but also not mobile phone [pe] I don't know why mobile phone cannot work cannot simulate touch although
[ah]
okay okay
I thought the
say what
outliers what what's that
[a'ah]
that's a
that's stressful
[ah] <malay>kalau</malay>
wait so
so
if I kick out if I sell or I kick out all these influential people [ah] cause I don't want them to disrupt my my my
reigning off terror [ah] [kan] but how how what will what's the repercussion
will I be able to recover or do I have to bring in another influential person if there is such thing
okay
okay
[ah]
actually true true so for example I give you an example
if I bring
let's say #ronaldo# #cristiano ronaldo#
okay from #juventus# to
maybe
man U
okay from man U
is he
a junior
in man U but he's an alumni
[ah] okay
[ah]
okay
(mm)
[ah] okay okay okay
okay
so okay [ah] #dortmund# #sancho# is the english guy is it okay okay
(mm)
ya <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
actually ya <malay>betul</malay> [ah] okay I know what you mean okay so
let's say let's say
this #sancho# is is english and let's say his his his old maybe thirty plus
okay let's say he's thirty plus
I bring him to maybe southampton or a or a full of junior club
so he will be a senior player or will he still be considered junior since
he just join the club
[ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
okay
okay
this social group is
very important [lah] actually
ya true that's
as sad as it is that's true
know I mean okay so I'm
the the the twenty inside the epic games store is not a trial not a
not a whatsoever is complete
full game for free
and
it is free on epic games but not
free on steam
okay so wait wait if I download it from epic game
free will the game be locked back or not after twenty four
you know like you know like
(mm)
okay
okay okay so it's only for epic games [ah]
okay
okay okay okay
okay I understand already
so maybe after
all these is over then maybe <malay>aku</malay> will check it out [lah]
[ah]
maybe I would
okay
unfortunately my current laptop don't have a LAN cable
no no as in they don't have the
<malay>takde</malay> [ah] I don't have I don't have the the the
port for it
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>tak baru</malay> it's it's quite latest [one] you know it's two thousand nineteen era
but I don't have the LAN cable cause well is more to you know more to notebook <malay>yang</malay> flat flat those [ah]
those [ah] [ah] okay the the reason why <malay>aku ada</malay> this laptop is <malay>pasal mak aku nak buat</malay> you know photoshop and and whatever nonsense [ah]
ya so so unfortunately my
laptop that has a LAN cable is my
poly era
which is
longer than two thousand fifteen longer than sixteen
so and that [one] is used to for my <malay>adik punya apa tu</malay> school
which Zoom <malay>pun boleh</malay> lag
no I mean sorry let me be more specific opening Zoom <malay>dah</malay> lag
running the whole thing <malay>nak</malay> type password <malay>dah</malay> you know when you type your full password then it takes a few second before the password starts to appear [ah] then
I mean
internal cleaning I don't know [lah] I I
[ah]
I I mean I I know about the the the
that cleaner equipment last longer blah blah blah but I don't know how my little brother <malay>pakai</malay> you know go to school carry here carry there sometimes go to
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] ya so anyway I will like I said I will try to how how how big is the file again
okay so
(mm)
it is intensive [ah] okay but anyway
okay [ah] maybe after this then I will give it a try [ah]
<malay>nanti</malay> [eh] so
the whole day [ah] <malay>nanti kau</malay> [ah] <malay>kau keluar</malay>
okay [lah] we can we can
okay if if I already download the the the game then maybe I can discuss some
new features with you that I may not be familiar with [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
well technically
if you want to use your social cycle you're the senior guy cause well you downloaded it yesterday
I download it today
yes okay
okay
okay
so
you never play the game I understand you never play you download the game you installed the game
you
maybe take a good look about it <malay>tengok-tengok</malay> look
look left look right
look look see see [lah] that's what they called it
now I go to the social circle context I buy this player
I never play him
one day two day okay maybe one season never play him
then I buy another player is he still more senior
yes even if I don't play him
ya so in the sense you are still more senior
in this familiarity
whether you play it or not
okay
(mm)
they have medical centre
okay no I I I okay I confused
what's the purpose of me jumping and see my injured player cause as a manager I want all I give
is you know
whether
he's at the training or not
(mm)
okay
I mean I mean
since I mean since the [ah] twenty is very realistic every every year is getting more and more and more and more realistic
I will be avoiding the medical centre cause I'm not really that sure look outside the window and everyone's wearing face mask and whatnot medical centres the last place you want to visit so for my own
simulated realism safety
I will avoid the medical centre I do not what I
the board of directors not gonna be happy if I have to be quarantine for fourteen days
then what do you expect me to do well manage the football from home
[ah] so
so imagine actually imagine
twenty one when there's the corona virus realism coming in wait wait imagine this
imagine
you play twenty one
your players got corona virus you got corona virus you got quarantine and then for two weeks two weeks
of being quarantined
you decide you you you said you know what
you gonna take out open your phone and then realise
[eh] [eh] how many days left of quarantine do you have
how many days left of real life quarantine you have [sia] god damn it four more days okay [ah] nevermind
since the whole two weeks so you got both quarantine in real life you got quarantine in game
that would be a very nice
situation to be in I mean not not the real quarantine [lah] maybe other people but that will be a very nice story for me to hear other people to be in
ya so ya I don't want to be quarantine
that will be that will be
that will be
real good imagine I mean if you maybe look the singapore league <malay>dia cakap</malay>
prime minister #lee hsien loong# announces circuit breaker S leagues to stop game
there is a singapore league already if I'm not wrong so how
then if I play the malaysian league
my maybe I don't know I don't know whether players like #haris harun# still there but borders are closed how's that how's that gonna help me
well technically
[ah] new season [pe] new season they go home and whatnot then how they gonna come back I lost a lot of star player then I got the argentinian guy or whatever his name is in #johor# [ah] ya <malay>takzim darussalam</malay> [eh] #johor# <malay>takzim</malay>
[ah]
if they all go back and then all borders closed how my my malaysian squad is not all malaysians [pe] is
majority foreigners so just like that I spend millions of ringgit malaysia
for nothing
(mm)
[ah] I mean
[ah]
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay wait
league one semi-pro that's actually very terrible [pe]
cause semi-pro is supposed to be the
north north south ya north south
how did bolton wanderers end up there
I mean how can they fall that bad
I mean
how how I mean in in what situation would how would club be that what what bad decision they can make
ya okay
I remember portmore
[a'ah]
okay
okay
(mm)
so okay [ah]
deducting points just cause you are
just cause you are bankrupt
means you will have a higher chance to get relegated
which means you continue to get bankrupt
sorry what
ya I mean like okay you see [ah]
how is there's no
maybe maybe our country is quite good
but there's no government support
there's ya there's no support for this kind of things so if I make you see [eh] when I
relegated
I have reduced
reduced amount of budget reduce reduce reduce reduce reduce
and cause I have all these reduced I cannot support myself I have to declare bankruptcy or maybe in the red zone for financial and then cause of that they deduct my points for me to get relegated and reduced even further and even further even further
until I become just nothing [ah]
(mm)
that is <malay>kalau ada orang</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay okay so
wait wait wait
this if if your if there is there
clubs so far that you know
they just drop and drop and drop and nobody give
and a
<malay>apa</malay> nobody give
them any any any chance
and they just disappeared from all the place
okay
#serie# A <malay>apa punya</malay> guess
(mm)
I mean you can ask #juventus# how they manage to drop so so much
suddenly
that [one] is their what italian one is it
[oh] okay
okay
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] that's so
!wah!
ya correct
(mmhmm)
[ah] yes yes
(mm) (mm)
[ah] okay I mean
well that's
actually quite sad [eh] <malay>kalau kau</malay> if you're from the
(err) when they are from the group of fans and whatnot then suddenly just cause of financial difficulties
your passion that football just disappear just like that
it be quite you know quite <malay>sedih</malay> [kan] actually to be what to be honest
but [ah] english english wise <malay>takde</malay>
cause there were
(mm) (mm)
<malay>takde tak</malay> I I I've seen the
english <malay>punya</malay> league
there is know the
<malay>cam</malay> the championship league one league two blah blah blah blah blah you know
even below north south
<malay>ye</malay> from national then north south
which is on the same path they still have below and below and below <malay>ada</malay> below what the heck I think I think it's
time for them to just you know what
regulate themselves dissolve all the useless clubs cause I think it's too much imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you know
singapore <malay>ada</malay>
S league delta league don't know what actually <malay>kita ada</malay> [lah] that is why the government decide to dissolve
not just the leagues itself but the entire sport industry as a whole [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah] that's why
ya
ya but
I mean ya [lah] I mean that <malay>macam adik aku</malay> every
day
every night [ah] <malay>dia</malay> [ah] he come back from his camp army camp <malay>nanti around</malay>
maybe six plus <malay>dia makan</malay> by seven he will be out
<malay>dengan</malay> member member <malay>dia</malay> (uh) <malay>kat bawah</malay> block
then <malay>main bola sampai pukul sepuluh balik</malay>
so everyday like this but he's not gonna tell us [lah] whether he he play in league <malay>ke</malay> he play in what nonsense [ah] cause
I mean technically if everyday
he has to play football I think it's not no longer fun anymore [ah] <malay>abeh takkan takkan</malay> [seh] [eh]
<malay>nak main bola</malay> like every single day at this certain time wearing this certain jersey with certain boot I think it's a bit
ya if you are
okay
used to be passionate about it I used to
I used to you know why or not cause you know
sometimes people
(err) physical
body change
and I may not be able to do the
top collar safe as I managed to do
as bad
no no no
no no no no I'm not I'm not fat is just I not I not
fat cause that's a very harsh way of describing certain diseases and handicap I'm not saying I am
one of the rare few who are not suffering world hunger [ah]
ya I mean I'm not I'm not suffering world hunger [ah] I'm the privileged [one] as compared to
whatever it is [ah] but there's a lot of african kid who's <malay>buncit</malay> so I can relate
so
but anyway anyway we put it aside ya I mean I used to why I said I used to have passion is cause

<malay>takde</malay> time you want to sleep more then work
people watch football at three I'm you know guarding certain installations which is not very fun at all I'm I mean I it's fun to guard certain installations
if you know maybe you are
spartan the hello universe but then if they are just standing down there looking at <malay>itik ayam kambing</malay>
than the cool installations I don't like it I I
is is how do I say [eh]
it makes you wonder it makes you ask yourself this question
you work so hard
okay you work so hard to to to to be in the middle income you work so hard to get out of the peasants and the farmers only only to safeguard
the peasants and the farmers
which is like a sandwich
know like sergeant being sandwiched by the men and by the officer bro it's the same thing you're sandwiched you have no
how do I say you have no freedom still
but ya true [ah]
to [ah]
well I mean
like what
how many times <malay>kita</malay> [ah] <malay>punya</malay>
[ah] ministers <malay>cakap apa</malay> unprecedented crisis
require unprecedented measures to be honest I don't even know exactly what the
precedented meaning is until he keep repeating until
suddenly I know the meaning without even googling it
so so that's how good he is you know
maybe he should just remain as education minister cause
he just keep repeating things until we know the meaning
without finding it out
(mm)
[ah] ya <malay>aku tahu aku tahu</malay>
but you <malay>minum</malay> how many times you cannot <malay>berbual</malay> tamil [tau]
if you notice
[eh] he cannot speak tamil [pe]
<malay>boleh ke</malay>
then he shouldn't
(mm)
election before the previous election two thousand fifteen
okay
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
nobody dubbed over him [kan]
dub <malay>boleh</malay> [eh] [ah] I mean <malay>kalau kau</malay> I mean if you just say vote for me for example vote for me I also can [ah]
if you're thirty minute speech I can just say #vanakam# for thirty times [ah] for for thirty minutes [pe] I think that would work it's not like I'm not gonna fool anyone it's not being I I mean technically if you who who who's gonna listen
in in in that language do you listen in <malay>melayu</malay> or do you listen in
english
of course [ah]
understand it is
okay anyway actually there something funny I need to need to share with you you see [ah] my my
[ah] what's that called [ah] my <malay>nenek</malay> my
grandfather my
basically all the old people [ah]
all the our not say ancestors our elders right
I realised one thing when they grow old they speak in mother tongue I mean you I I haven't heard anyone come come out and speak in proper british english
to me [lah] so far so
I have when I was young
I asked my grandfather he said I say why your I I ask him in in malay why your always speak malay
and you know what he told me that until now traumatise not say traumatise kind of until now I bring you know he said
once you grow old he say <malay>bila</malay> once <malay>dah tua</malay>
[ah] the only language you will remember will be mother tongue
so so so I grow up thinking that is the way
then I then I ask myself if my mother tongue is is crap
how the heck am I gonna communicate when I grow old what people just gonna write me up as dementia or what
ya
(mmhmm)
okay
[a'ah]
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
okay
okay
ya correct
(mm)
but actually
I I haven't pin it but then the the things changed when I was working as a in in checkpoint and then I I met into this (uh)
not say rider [ah] this passenger who needs to need to go to toilet if I'm not wrong
need to go to toilet or need to get the white paper white white pass so he so she came to me very old lady in
with walking stick like <malay>dia datang</malay>
and then and he and she asked me in english about I don't know toilet or the white paper thing the white form
what want to go from #johor# to singapore and whatnot right so I was confused I say what I mean the english was very good
right
a malay a a malay old lady walking to me in walking sticks with walking sticks I mean
looking at another malay officer at that point of time
and speak in english so I take the passport and there was a tiger
logo down there her malaysian passport holder
who (um) who is a malay elder with walking stick I don't know why so important about the walking stick okay I have to emphasise
but but coming to a obvious malay officer
and of all the language she choose <malay>abeh</malay> luckily she didn't choose
mandarin or tamil [lah] if not there will be quite a very big job but she choose english and honestly the english is more fluent [ah] and then I
reply
I I I when I want to reply in english I feel very awkward
I mean talking to talking to
a malaysian
in a old old lady old old lady in malaysia
a malaysian old lady I mean
right !wah! this is very confusing [ah]
but technically technically technically I'm not wrong there
both descriptions are true [pe]
malaysian old lady and a old lady in malaysia <malay>apa</malay>
well from
ya should use the word from ya so anyway okay
so
imagine speaking
tiptop formal or maybe as clear cut english not singlish [ah] no [sia]
you know you cannot say even you're not even supposed to [eh] <malay>nenek</malay> you want go where no no you say [oh] where you heading ma'am
so you imagine you say that to an obvious maybe like a relative or a cousin where you have to use the word ma'am
it's like <malay>dok cik</malay> you know it sound so weird know
but
and <malay>dia punya</malay> english is really tiptop [ah] so I I I suspect
I suspect
!aiya! I mean in the first place maybe <malay>ada</malay> the word <malay>datuk kat depan dia punya dia punya</malay>
I mean the car is quite posh and whatnot but
then you you make me wonder
so what english is your mother tongue
that's why you grow up remember english as your core language
(mm)
so how
[a'ah]
(mm)
okay
then <malay>mati</malay> [ah] <malay>tak boleh berbual</malay> [ah]
you you agree [pe] okay say if I only know english for example then when I grow old I say [lah] how
[ah]
ya that's why
[ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
but [ah] <malay>ye</malay> [lah] true
so so I mean
maybe you never know until you grow up that that's for sure I mean I'm not
I'm not going to you know bite my tongue or hold my breath or anything maybe one day you when you grow old you speak to me in french or italian I'm not gonna hold my breath
the the idea of we both growing old is not to understand each other how many times right
when old people ask us [eh] <malay>dah kahwin</malay> [eh] <malay>dah ni dah tu</malay> you answer also they are not gonna listen [pe] they just gonna keep asking whatever we talk they just talk [pe] unless you want to
remind each other about know how your going and calling each other brother in italian [pe]
okay but you you understand what I trying to say [pe]
the group of people has been the same thing over and over again
cause they are old and nobody listens
(mm)
ya
I mean [ah] there there is a I think there's a occasion [pe] there's a certain
old indian guy at the coffee shop who
apologise over and over again
wait wait and he and he said multiple times <malay>dia tak nak</malay> interrupt us he don't want to he [pe] he just over here he don't want interrupt us
yet he's always interrupting us [oh] by the way [ah]
<malay>aku nampak dia minum tu kat bawah sini pasal</malay> you know why or not you know why or not
<malay>dia tinggal tingkat lapan</malay> that time that time <malay>aku</malay> that time <malay>aku nampak dia keluar nasib aku pakai</malay> mask <malay>dengan topi</malay> [sia] you know
(mm)
so
so so so he got the you know he
I
the number is already one I from level eleven stop at level eight right he go in he hold the door open
then he look at me he and he ask me <malay>nak pergi tingkat mana</malay> hello I mean I'm not trying to be rude or anything
but if somebody is going down I'm pretty sure there's a very high chance
<malay>dorang nak pergi tingkat satu</malay>
there's a very high chance I'm not judging I'm not judgemental <malay>ke apa benda</malay>
(err) right if I from
if I were my high high level going down I'm
don't judge I don't want to talk so much
there's a very high chance
when the number is already pressed the red colour light is already at number one try to assume he's going number one
cut the conversation move along
then
(mm)
[ah]
okay okay
[ah] coming up ya
correct correct
I mean
I mean technically #asu# [pe] #asu# <malay>terperanjat</malay> [lah] that you
you came in a very quiet manner cause there's is <malay>kau datang</malay> awkward [sia]
<malay>bila</malay>
time <malay>ke</malay>
that [one] for what [eh]
time <malay>aku</malay> <malay>asal</malay> [ah] <malay>kau datang</malay>
okay
okay
okay
(mm)
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] that is quite long [tau]
ya actually a lot of things changed [ah]
but it's nice
[ah] ya [lah]
think it's time for us to actually
get a proper second house
like work or or or or whatnot [lah] I mean it's so so constricted [lah] this place to be honest
<malay>macam</malay> if you're just being stuck here I mean you know how it feels [pe] to be stuck at home
(uh) twenty twenty four seven
like there's no purpose at least <malay>kalau kau</malay> you know <malay>kau gi kerja</malay> there is a purpose I in life
you wake up early in the morning you come back at there is a
there's a [ah] there is a schedule
[ah]
[ah] now is just wake up you don't know what you gonna do
going go with the flow and then the whole day twenty four good hours just wasted like that
I mean

work not you already burn half a day in your birthday already [tau]
how unproductive are you going to get

to
quote unquote our prime minister status
for unpaid
I mean
I mean I'm not saying anything [lah] but in order for you to you know
move forward in this pandemic is to ensure the china tension doesn't rise any higher cause
as long as and china is continue to be fighting I don't think there will be a vaccine anytime soon
[ah]
[ah] ya
okay
[ah]
now that's a very interesting concept
[ah]
[ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm)
okay
I
I don't want to die
the what's that called I mean I don't know what the are trying to think [ah] but
but (uh) I mean if we see (uh)
technically if the government is not very
is saying is saying that the mask does not work
I think we can raise it up to our [ah] and
[ah]
so maybe we can raise up to our and ask our government to release us from this
mask thing I mean
we got safe entry [pe]
the the thing is does it work though
