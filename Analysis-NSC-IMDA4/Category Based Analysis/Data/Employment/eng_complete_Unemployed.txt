okay
and ya he say he want to think about it first
but I mean come on ah
I rather do it now with you then wait for his reply what you know what I mean
because
I'm not sure whether because they say the spots are filling up very fast
so I say that to him lah
mm
so they were looking for people to debate lah like eighty
eighty dollars if you get
ah I'm not sure whether per debate or what because I mean I love to debate what
so uh
err I
you just need to talk for one hour
with me
we've known each other for how many years
twelve seven years
you know what I mean
maybe maybe maybe
alright okay so
mm
seriously ah
okay
okay we don't talk about lah eh
is err
that's yes correct that's the main reason why I left
uh huh
ah right
that's the thing ah
even
but government allow sport activity what
ah
so I call this guy he's known for speaking ah good malay
uh to mix we always mix
ah
a'ah it's very standard ah
err okay so three wishes
I would wish
to have err
army style discipline
okay
because
correct but it takes a lot of work
and you know me I'm a very lazy person
okay okay okay lah let's stop like unrealistic not unrealistic but
things which are not reachable our wishes okay
I would wish
oh my god
you know what
okay next question
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
why do you like what what what were your dreams or what are your dreams
ya can can
mm ah okay okay
so
very hard for maybe a few years before you can actually like you know
something like that
ah alright alright alright alright I understand I understand
me
basically right if I were to follow my dreams
I would drop my err future lah
basically my livelihood
because that K basically I really want to
ah be a professional sports player
okay
uh huh
a professional sports player maybe soccer football K we talk about soccer lah cause
they have very good prospect in a sense
err but the thing is if at this age I were to like you know try
maybe I'll take one to two years mean at least twenty plus then I'll be in a professional team
but in the meantime who's gonna pay for my livelihood
for example if I made it big who's gonna before I make it big who's gonna pay for my part maybe I want play in a England who gonna pay for my flight there accommodation food
ah so before that success I have to
the risk basically my parents money lah
ah
ya that that's another thing
because
okay let's not talk into specific lah but
Singapore soccer is a no no lah
all macam haziq
ah that's a bit unrealistic the passion is uh actually is that I understand I used to have that passion but to be realistic and have a livelihood in Singapore using that kind of err
career pathway so called
it is not realistic to have a easy life lah
ah
alright
sorry
ah true true Malaysia pay better
um
but I mean it is what it is
yeah
alright
next question if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
ya basically any superpower ah
but why though
police police are you all hearing this police
me I would love to teleport ah
anywhere and everywhere
wah so I don't have to think about being late
so I don't have to pay for transport
actually basically it's about being late lah I don't want to be late lah
ya so for example ah
my parents ask me to be home by seven
six fifty nine
if possible at six fifty nine point fifty nine
mm
no
I mean it looks
interesting honestly it looks interesting
but I am watching a more
not realistic more historical drama
basically I'm I'm watching ah
it is a
historical turkish drama so basically before how they found turkish the ottoman empire right how to ottoman empire started
this is how this is the drama about lah
ah
it is an emotional story
um sad
but
no it's a series series
mm but the first two seasons super draining
super draining cause they go through torture after torture after torture
yeah
hmm
okay let's see
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago
what would be inside
wait what
if
okay I I don't understand this question do you
if you could turn back time
oh
I think they should put
if you could turn back them where would you go to
that will be an easy answer
I will turn back to
primary four
why
because basically I got first in class ah in primary three right
okay
it was a fluke I didn't study and it was a super fluke seriously
so I got first in class so I got confident so sorry primary five primary five
then I got first in class again in primary four you know
it's time to blend in because I I won't I didn't blend blend in well err in primary school
ah because
um
how to say eh
I might have been a little bit of a smart alec
so people generally disliked me actually
yup
no lah I mean that that's the problem ah because
back then
if I didn't I hadn't had this issue and I didn't I wasn't arrogant
I wouldn't have err you know
I was like there are these people dislike me I want to blend in with them
you knock the door get out of the staircase go down
ah play soccer at the void deck all lah so
I will change my mindset lah but then without this the the thing is the thing about life right
it wouldn't us in the future
so that's the thing I'm like if I could turn back time would I turn back time
but if this didn't happen I wouldn't be like this you know what I mean
yes definitely
because
I hate this ah cliche phrase
it's true ah what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I mean basically that song was over how do you say over hyped
like you know for example ah that song is good
but then a lot of people start to sing it before you even get to hear it is like wah
I'm not gonna listen to it because people make it sound so annoying for example
I still remember this song payphone
it was a famous song it was not bad of a song ah kan maroon five is one of the
yeah one of the good guys
but because of people around like payphone I'm like no I'm not gonna listen to it
ah
what's worse is you hate a song
like you are that early not early founders ah basically before other people hear and it's overhyped you hear this
then people start eh you know this song or not but you are thinking these songs like two three weeks ago
but then after two three weeks then people start to hype it like this song ah
old town road
so
I think I've not formerly I was I listen to it because ah there was this video playing that song ah so like oh not bad the the the song is quite catchy okay
I go search old town road K ah I put it in my playlist for like one two weeks
I removed from my playlist then people start telling me about this song I'm like
it's in my heart I'm like excuse me
you know but I'm like oh ya eh nice song nice song ah
so it's damn annoying ah actually
please please please don't talk about our campus radio
I'm I'm glad he didn't join
we should have been the lah
okay lah okay lah we cannot throw shades lah okay let's not throw shades alright
yeah
okay we have a very good question here
what is the one thing that you wish was free
mm
yeah
make sense
yeah precisely
yeah
you know what's worse actually
transport is another matter I feel what needs to be free is healthcare
for those who can't afford it
yeah
because you know
um
some countries let's not name them
the price
is horrible
and
some countries ah will want you to pay first before the surgery happen imagine right a heart surgery
critical surgery
mm
ya
precisely
mm mm mm
that's a sensitive uh topic
okay
let's see next question eh
if humans no longer need to work to survive what would we do mm very good question
ya we K basically right
what you're trying to say here is like so called
so their work is technically just taking care of their their herds lah
so in return they get is
food
correct
so actually if you think about it
you don't need to work
you have a few cow sheep chicken
um rice
all yours
what do you need to worry about
think about it what do human need
food water air
precisely
but because of the modernisation of
the world
people find a need ah okay I want a
iphone
because it's the best
and ah okay basically iphone is good lah those who have it is good but I want a latest iphone because a new one just came out I wanna keep up with the trend
um shirt let's spend five thousand dollars on a piece of shirt
which I can get for ten dollars at pasar malam
and then
shoe uh twenty thousand lah
you know ah Off-white with Gucci and maybe Versace
yeah
my pants I would spend about two thousand dollars because the materials you know the material actually
I also don't know what the material but it costs two thousand means it's good right
you know something
my friend was talking about someone who
ah bought a very expensive car lah
uh so recently so I was like
okay
so
they are like eh you know this this and this bought this and this I'm like oh okay so
because like
come on think about it think about it you buy a fast car
in Singapore how fast you wanna go
two hundred kilometre power
you buy something not to make full use of it
this will happen when you got too much money lah
you want to show off
and all
give me their money lah I can put to better use
okay oh yes sorry
mm
uh
but people just live to complicate it
ah
so I guess this is the challenges in life you have to face lah
that's harsh but
you gotta do what you gonna do lah right
alright next question
oh this is a good question what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
for me eating
like
if I'm full
and I don't want to waste food
it is a torture for me
so imagine have to do it for eight hours oh my god
oh my god I can't imagine it
I think that's the best tortures someone can give me
yeah
I mean K
the thing is yes there are good foods and like for example if a food is good I can eat four times
but
if the food is mediocre one time is enough but even if I were to eat a very nice food right
yeah
ya so like
like they say ah everything in moderation is good
no that was that is to
do a certain
ya so that's understandable
I guess so I was dreaming this
you were at the table the setting was different lah
but the shop and what they sell is is correct
so basically I went to queue for guess guess
what would I buy
yes burger
I was dreaming of the burger but I was thinking the burger in the dream
so I'm like eh so there's now two shops eh
the most important thing in a food
is the look
if I were to try new food lah outside food the look is so important
mm mm
and
mm
is that even a question
of course I would come unless I got ah
hopefully
oh you know what I just want to come lah
um next month
yeah
if you are wondering why I'm looking at the right right
like you know I'm not looking here because basically the main screen is here but you are at the second screen
err oh okay okay oh okay okay
okay hmm
oh okay what is the pettiest reason that you would like to dislike someone eh sorry sorry sorry
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
mm
face
same same same same same
yeah
but ya
I mean it's true but for me I I guess I guess in my opinion
I feel like I have a
some people just the face
it's like you know how they say a picture tells you a thousand words or thousand things yeah I guess I I implement that to people face ah
okay I wouldn't say expert because
err I mean if I say I'm an expert that will be bragging right
first
okay the first one was the first was quite right lah
because
I see him I think he's like that we got close
then we our way then he is like that
so I guess in a way it's it's right but the one I'm wrong is you
your hair
it's your hair
your hair compliment your face when you first came in school
but come on lah it was like what blonde
then I was like
ah see ah this one ah
see a lot of her classmates like that already
but when I got to know you all you all are the best people in
you have to admit ah
as strenuous as three as our course is
we have the best people
in our course yes
but compared to other course compared to other course we are like
pretty little rascals
ah the
eh don't do this lah
you know what I mean you are like come on lah you know what
guys you will get caught next time
but kena our
you wanna get expelled is it
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm
but did you do it
yes
I knew it
but I mean for you twenty classes or twenty opportunities to look for the right one
no comments
um okay
let's see
what is the pet sorry we went through that already okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would that be
what would they be
I
um
for me
mike ross
yes photographic at absolute best memory
everything I hear everything I see is in my head
I want to that kind of memory
um
can ah but how long want to train
yeah
that's first second is err
skill eh
maths
ah I am good at cracking jokes
I already master that since I was like primary school so
but maths ah maths ah like you know people who need the calculator and like
you go shop then got a lot of uh discount this discount that interest this interest that
that is inevitable so like when they calculate I calculate it must tally so that they cannot cheat me ah
ah
I straight away you give me okay twenty percent of this with ten percent of that then minus zero point eight percent of this then you get this this this this this I want to have it in my head
mm
mm mm
ya but not the maths that we use like you know what I mean
like depends depends depends
algebra would be used for those algebraic works
but plus minus times divide
yes
okay
it's good lah they give a few
so that we don't run out of things to talk about
okay did
okay wait let me search the meaning of this word retrospect
alamak cannot search ah
what is do you have any idea what's the meaning of retrospect
actually I heard but I don't know the meaning lah
K retrospect
a survey or review for past course of events oh basically
a remembrance of a past course of event
that you feel is funny but at that time is not funny
okay I got one
okay
so
that is my first time meeting fabian okay
you all told me he was scary he was this he was that
so he would I mean I didn't laugh but inside my heart I was laugh but after that when I leave the office I also laugh
but then it's not funny lah okay we skip class
then you remember remember the joke
take out the ring take out the lanyard
put hand on our table look at both of us he always do that
ya ya ya ya
but if you think about it if you think about it is actually
a scolding ah a serious scolding ah
but
sometimes you gotta take
the silver lining of a bad situation right
I deserve the scolding
okay but
I gotta cheer myself up
ah
I mean
it's hard lah it's hard
yeah
damn but
oh my god I miss class
ninety percent of people I miss lah definitely
ninety percent
that that ten percent
you cannot talk about it lah eh let's not throw shade to people lah eh
but oh my god I miss our class with
uh ham boy
S&W
uh
you only spend time when ah
actually you only spend time when we going home so I miss going home with you lah
like that we really sit down and talk
ah
ah yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
I mean I was ah
ah
so I mean it it it comes in handy
but not every time lah
ah
but
come on it was something super unexpected
but is the biggest reason is because
okay we were O level students correct
you were you were you were right you were O levels what okay what
is our true purpose of
um graduating from secondary school for O levels student
like what is our so called rite
poly or correct
so okay lah
maybe O level we couldn't do well
because of certain subjects at maths science I don't know what else okay
err
ya okay then you have to go to okay
then from where's where's the next destination
I when I never study I get this but when I study
I get zero point zero two
you know what I mean
but
ah
and I have better options ah I have better prospect so
if I'm gonna go this way
but if I choose another way I got better potential so I did the right thing but was hard thing to do ah to leave you all
but do you know what made it easier
because I hated every moment of
one week then I didn't come for another one week
you know what I mean
but you don't push a big
lump sum of work to us just because we are free we are not
accustomed to that what you know what I mean
like giving
so
true lah true
yeah
I really busy but if you come I can make time for you because K basically right now I'm more free ah
cause I'm laying low a bit
ah I'm relaxing a bit
gathering myself for bigger things lah in the future
mm so you can actually come down
three more right
mm
alright alright I I will look forward I will look forward then will be here for
huh
fifteen minutes fifteen ah serious expressway
mm mm mm mm mm in Singapore you wanna rev come on lah
you throttle abit beep
kena fine
okay
let's see
okay okay okay
what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
um
let me think ah
it it seems good right
oh
I wanted to
like you know my friend buy then I get the free one lah
what happened
oh your wifi seems abit bad lah eh
okay lah I think we go next question ah it's a good question
good looks or fit body what would you prefer
okay we we apply it to ourselves lah ah not to other people lah
what would you rather have
yes
now I'm nineteen right maybe nine years ago
okay with me in my teens thirteen I mean I'm still my teens but
when I still interested in sports
definitely fit body
hundred percent
because I could go far
I really could go far but
like that lah this I guess this my fate lah
so if
in the past yeah fit body now ah
whatever god give me I'll take lah
like uh whatever it is lah good looks fit body
but now I'm going to so I guess I have to choose fit body again lah
like know because
ah but oh my god you ask me to you ask me to run okay sit up manageable but I'm just not a upper upper body strength guy
that's why that's why like I don't play
hyper transport
and even if I do play right the roads I play are very
suit to my body lah like
we don't need upper body strength
you don't pass don't shoot eh
don't pass
don't need
just defend the ball
because I'm the fastest guy in court
so it's annoying lah because
fastest
sometimes means the best but I'm the fastest but not the best
if you look at the oppunent team eh
the best is usually the fastest
ah but then you put
myself in my shoe you put yourself in my shoe I'm the fastest but I'm not the best in fact the worst ah offensively
ah
so
but I have to keep up with those uh because yeah basketball is technically new to me I started playing like what four years ago only and people have been playing since primary school
okay that's one
so I'm not exposed to
basketball as much as them so they can do things
and you tell me okay so just do this do this do that but then I still can't do it because I'm just not um
used to it ah like I'm not exposed to it what
ah
mm mm mm mm yes
okay
there's one good question
actually not one good question I've been saying that for the past few questions
if you were to eat one dish
for the rest of your life what would it be
for the rest of your life
for me
for the rest of my life bro
frugal eh
the one near the bus stop to go to
yes yes yes
super cheap super affordable bro I add extra chicken with K
I bought one plate
of a one set you know with the vegetable and all
add extra chicken add extra rice costs me less than
seven eight dollars
less than that no five six dollars you know
where you're gonna get in Singapore
your house lah because free what
right
oh chicken rice for the win bro
funny ah you
nah
nah nah nah nah nah
poly is not my thing anymore studying is not my thing anymore chey
oh I mean you want to go there to eat chicken rice I will probably get scolded by my parents
but I don't mind
chicken
beef
ah
kampung chicken they make sure it's from a
not say kampung lah but you know kampung means they bring it up naturally
ah it it it you don't have to worry about the
others lah
uh
correct correct
yes yes
so they are very particular when it comes to food because it's the basic survival what the basic survival need
eh
O K S I
okay maybe it's oxygen
maybe ah I don't know it's been a long time K last time I I we use that was like primary six I think
yeah
what do you think of the COVID situation now
sometimes better is not enough right
then
ya wah I mean
true lah true
but you
you you know something that I wish they could implement in Singapore because of this COVID nineteen situation
every store
okay or at least those super crowded store
that people will go to
have a
uh system
so we don't have to queue and wait
what time they give they allow us to be there we'll be there
but be strict ah
we book from this time to this time exactly at that time you must leave
ah
correct
mmhmm
um
wah
yeah
you know what okay
no very simple
then we open
um
like uh
only for pioneer generation lah
why not
yeah
correct or not if the old people are not a tech savvy enough okay they go
ah
must use the ah reservation booking
yeah
uh whether they have space or not and but come on ah
the
this is the problem right find solution lah
not run away or not just like you know what
I don't care
let's just open our shop we need to make money
this the thing about Singapore cause every single thing cause money
every single thing
of course every country but there are countries who ah
how to say handle this quite well very very well in fact
ya but
I mean
it is what it is lah ah
so we just have to take care of ourselves lah that's why you know ah like
honestly this phase two open my eyes a lot ah like
actually we don't have to go out always
ah but that is different thing but you know to go out every single day
you go out transport money
food money
shopping money
money money money
everything is money bro you wanna go here to here okay lah you never eat outside you bring food from home food food from home also cost money
you got out take transport also money
ah
correct
ah
ya because K want to lepak okay but
not outside you know what I mean like that's why I always invite you to come my house
ah
it is prone to have problems
like my neighbourhood is very peaceful so okay lah
nothing much
ah
no
mmhmm
seriously
then later when the number of cases spike then everyone panic so
no comments lah this kind of thing is very
just let let
let it be lah eh
we don't have much say but
okay lah I mean we'll just don't be those kind of people lah
but
ah
I don't appreciate it
seriously firework is overrated for me
like
okay
I could just create this using my computer
you know what I mean
but I it it's just me lah I don't appreciate it lah I appreciate doing I'm all for doing kind of than seeing kind of guy
like you bring me to the most beautiful country with the best place to sightsee I would appreciate
like you bring me to a country with the best theme park I would go
ah
correct correct
okay that's different lah that's different lah bali nah
nah
but normal normal asia bro it's europe
or south america bro
okay lah if you talk realistically ah you want to go to europe also you have to go to the europe safe country lah Turkey
ya
they they handled the situation quite well
based on what I heard lah because you see ah like
U ah they are very big hit
ah so it's quite worrisome to go there ah
mm
greenland
no
mm mm mm mm
is it greenland or iceland ah that has no army
don't have army yeah one one one of this wait also one of this country don't have mosquito
I think it's greenland
because you see ah it's so err
precisely greenland got ice iceland is green
legit ah
oh oh oh oh oh
oh okay
mm
mm why
I don't know why didn't you apply for it
but it is still available ah still available lah
go for it bro go for it bro
in times of crisis we need
if you can get if you need help we have to
get whatever we can lah
but don't beg
yeah
ah yes yes yes
I off all the light
and my window is closed ya
hundred three sixty degree
from always awake
I'm a morning person now
impossible right
I'm a morning person now bro
I made it I made it
mm
like sixty minute
oh
ah we stop this then we see we will do the others together alright K three two one

okay I think we can begin have you played yours
then I clap eh
the first one
okay we'll do this if you were to eat one dish
ya actually it's not generic because actually the the other day I was actually talking to my friend
to eat
then I'm like huh
like isn't that like boring but then again like you think about it ya you have the carbs then you have the meat the protein
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
it depends ah maybe can switch in with like the roasted or like the steam one
mee goreng but you know me and mee goreng
I know but it's so good I don't know why it's just that mee goreng taste
I have this so you can
I bought
so my friend bought this you don't mind I don't know if it's halal or not lah
which I don't think it is
this is actually konjac jelly konjac you know C O N J A C
ah have you tried mala before
colleague
no K initially I I don't really like the idea of mala cause actually I I went to hai di lao we this is not halal
but my friend brought me to hai di lao and then they had two
they specifically bought like no pork at all lah
uh because I was around cause I don't eat pork or don't eat beef right then I eat chicken and seafood
and they were like okay you have to try mala they so bad you know like you have to try mala I was like what this this this big deal about mala sia everyone's like talking about it
so then I tried and then
I think it's maybe it's too kaw
you know kaw
yes
like too strong like that
uh
it's chilli oil
yes yes exactly it's the same thing so it's it basically like just chilli oil lah
ya
K this one you have to eat it on off the bed out off the bed off the bed
because it might spill I or maybe I open for you ah
why you moving that thing over all around
okay K nah
try not to spill on your shirt cause you're wearing white
ya err okay K ya ya uh it so it's konjac jelly
so it's basically just jelly
it never says that it's halal or not but it's just jelly basically it's just jelly
you know how I don't like spicy right
so when she gave there was there's a green one there's an orange one
which is less spicy the green one is spicy is is spicy and sour
the orange one is less spicy the red one is super spicy
but I realized about this mala taste is like the spicy is like now spicy it doesn't like linger
ya you know like it will stuck then I will be I hate that feeling that's why I don't like spicy food actually
so this is actually kind of perfect
you just eat it off like that it's actually really delicious eh
you think the conversation is good
like

from now onwards like if you make it into a book it's fantastic it's good the idea is there the layout the foundation is there
but then to make it live that's like better
it is of of course it's like believable lah ya the whole fantasy is believable
because it's like you can see yes exactly it's a very visual
but it's a lot of work actually

I don't know

K I have a diploma in mass comm
degree in business marketing
in building drafting which is architecture
so I'm like
one thing to the other to the other
and then now I was thinking
about psychology a lot lately because initially I wanted to take that but
it wasn't safe lah but like now lately with all the mental stress
diploma in psychology and
ya I don't know lah I was just thinking a lot about it ah I don't uh it's been about two months already
why do you feel like certain way
at a certain time
um
more of a selfish thing I want to know about myself not only that
but I want to
I want to know why people react in a way ah
because I see people change and I see
like
like after a while you be like eh a he's actually a very nice kind of like he or she like is actually a nice person but maybe it's because of COVID
mm everyone is so wary dodgy now
sus yes sus

K yes I was in exhibition line
K it's getting a bit too personal already
I thought of like changing
changing the career line lah
changing the career and instead of
this whole cause the whole of uh the whole talk of like career switch whatever then I was thinking about it lah
maybe I should should I should I or should I not or is it a waste of money
what do you think personally

it's more of a personal thing to be to be honest it's more of a personal I want to know why people act such way and
not only people but myself also lah
mmhmm

um okay I saw that fashion show where they were doing like
those headpieces
with those beads pearls laces

into making a mask
you know the face mask that we are wearing
cause like everyone's wearing a normal
normal mask the most fanciest one is they buy from like
carousell whatever
uh ya very lame and cheap and always the same design
I thought of creating something that is like stand out
yes with beads lace
and then maybe can incorporate your methodology
or like earring whatever not not really earring lah but like maybe like some
metal pieces that you can stick you saw raja
the one the mouthpiece that raja wore the
that cover the whole face but leave out the eyes like catwoman like that kan cool kan
uh ya I thought of doing that

come my friend is sell trying to sell me something
some E commerce thing
really right like it feels like yesterday but it's actually a long time ago it's actually
know it feels so long ago but it's actually just this year only to give I mean yes
you get what I mean
then I'm like
and then I wouldn't call it like the curse of twenty twenty but a lot of things really happen there like the airbnb didn't go well
the whole ya I told you about the airbnb didn't go well
it was supposed to be like five minutes off times square but instead it's like
no not twenty twenty is really slow walk ah but it's about fifteen minutes
no less than fifteen ten mintues ten fifteen minutes
walk down to times square it it's still a good location ah in the end we loved it ah
in the end we loved it we grew to love it but initially we thought it was just beside so like can see the
fireworks whatever but in the it's actually far away and then in the end
we wanted we the whole idea was to was to do new year's
new york twenty twenty new york new year twenty twenty
to see the fireworks whatever the ball drop ah
ya hello we went
because of the airbnb the stupid airbnb is like so far away not far away about fifteen minutes away
we had to buy the because the roads were cordoned off
we didn't know so I went down I was like um sya was
that's why a lot of things happened
then she cannot wake up early then I was like okay I wake up early I just
so I woke up early just to see
whether we can go to times square cause I
I seriously thought you don't need to pay anything apparently people can queue to get inside the ball drop
but you have to queue like the night before
then the night before we were walking right was empty
so I didn't know you have to queue like we we were home which was about maybe three people start queuing already
ya which is
too far they were cordoned off already
like you have to really have to picnic and it's out in the cold it's like winter it's like four degrees
so I went down at about
ten no wait ya
slightly earlier than ten I was like eh the roads are closed
the police officer was like no no no enter I was like no I want to buy something he was like no you no then I was like my friend is over there I don't know where I stay
then he was like nope
no excuses turn back so I was like oh shoot then I say how do I get in he say you have to purchase a ticket I was like huh
so we went I went online
and then found out there is this bar hopping
within that area
is not in in but it's around
around the no not around the area but is like within the ball drop you can see the ball drop the bar hop within the
and it costs five hundred I thought I told you before
mm
it costs five hundred so ya I think it that was like
part of the twenty twenty curse a lot of thing really happened
but it didn't felt it it felt much more of an adventure instead of this whole year
ya this whole year was like a lot of slacking actually inside this room
carpet eh seriously I need to change this carpet
mmhmm
see
alhamdulillah
but that's good right
I told you right see the positivity
yes manifestation of positivity and who pushed you
who went around
excuse me he died a long time ago
ya he did what
exactly a long time ago what
yes samled
mister samled
he passed away he's a good boy
codeswitching
like towards the end I never expected eh
ya
I didn't feel as sad as I should be
I don't know why
he's been forever kan
since you were like four or five
ya four or five ah
until you're like what seventeen
sec five
so seventeen
sixteen
ya seventeen minus five is like what
twelve years man that cat
ya
he had no restrictions he could have gone anywhere everywhere but he still remain orh
actually I felt like I want to take a pet actually
ya what's the point right
I was really thinking a lot about this during quarantine
ya but during quarantine during
remember
speaking of which rental so my friend was thinking
should we move in together you saw that house
that listing ya
ya that's why
the room is small smaller than this
yes
I no this is to be honest this is actually a perfect size for me
I can fit like this
queen sized bed I still got a
or like walk around and do my work here or like
yes exactly so like to move to a smaller space I cannot I cannot
downgrade myself
everyone needs the money
but
seriously everyone
everyone left already all the expats all left already so like
why is everything still so expensive
like there's a lot of things on the market but everything's expensive
odd right
mmhmm
you want to swap
yes I want to swap I'm telling you I want to swap
mmhmm
uh huh
shouldn't be that expensive what to entice people to buy what or like rent
downgrade
decrease
mmhmm
I hope it will
because that place looks good
but then the thing is really small lah
a false wall
then like I'm like huh
no not only that he say he wants to do like short term like maybe three
or six months then I was like no only if you are doing this ah
for one year at least one year I'm looking at one year and above not not at least one year
one year and above
then I can consider moving in with you then he was like oh I was looking at maybe like maybe three to six months then I'm like ah okay no way
but it's costly lah
it's nice sia it's nice it is really cozy like with the lights and all kan with the window
oh ya speaking of which just now I pass by uh river valley
so I was looking at that place then I'm like oh my god I really miss that place
I really miss that place
huh I miss the outside I was like walking through the whole thing
ah that
I love the outside I hated my room
it's like porter room so small
river valley
wait where you which one you talking about
potong pasir
no
potong pasir yes
potong pasir I love the room because it was an upgrade
they clean once in a while it was nice
the room is nonsense but the hall is huge and I'll always sleep slept at the hall
yes
hmm
huh when
she cook curry
mm
huh then where was I
oh interesting
exactly exactly plus the hall was already so huge
so the windows made it look huger
look bigger huger you know make it look
bigger
ya if only the rent there is cheap
yes it's considerably expensive ya of course for myself
no no no no no no no no no rent a proper room this uh this time round lah but it's still expensive now is too expensive
it's like almost two thousand dollars
you can do so many things with two thousand dollars
that's the thing about renting you have to really think about it like I told my friend he was like should I move out or should I move in with my brother then I was like uh
eh no not move in like once you pay rent it feels good for the first month because you are paying for like something that you are staying in
the second month okay still okay the third month onwards is like a bit like a bit ridiculous because you are like you feel like
what am I doing
like why am I putting this amount of money
to rent
mm
but then again it is when like you have to pay to stay right

okay can
oh serious
okay lah then tell mama cannot lah if she want then can go to sentosa or something
that will be nice ah
ah
the laser tag thingy right
ya coming into december then my parents think about renovation for their house and the renovation is a little bit of a nightmare

the err primary school
I don't know I don't keep track also err too confusing the kid is at primary four or primary five I think
actually I don't ah I don't join teaching because I don't want to be under also
that's why I do adjunct
ya the stress I think my friends you know in teaching career okay lah actually the the reason why I don't join teaching is because I want my holidays lah
no I want my holidays during off peak period
mm
kindergarten
that day my niece came over but ya she's at the age where she knows how to play already so my neighbours one also
ya
yes last resort mm
I I enjoy teaching when I was like at the science centre
ya there's no stress they enjoy the kids really enjoy what they are doing because for them they are doing experiment kan so they don't see it as something that is examinable so they really enjoy what they are learning so I I wanted to find that kind of thing lah but imagine teaching the same thing over and over for like seven years
ya to the point where I sometimes will just blurt out whatever is the teaching content without registry registering in my brain
mm
oh maybe I just don't handle stress well
ah like you have that where you must make sure the kid improve
okay I think I hear too much stories about the second one so I got like a bit scared of
ya I teach my mendaki kids before and they were super sweet
like now they are together under and so by right when they take teachers also they should take those under and they are not fit so that that one I you know lah
they have been trained
ya amazing

ya err
no thanks to david moyes we sold him back to crystal palace and look bit us back um bit our hand back
and you associated with all of them
the like one of the two world class players available
for like twenty five million and we bought harry maguire for eighteen million
ya ah the the cause
what what what did he say cause he doesn't know enough about thiago he doesn't know enough about a person who's playing in barcelona central midfield who's playing the champions league week in week out
I can't believe sia
he fought against his captain and he lost
west ham a'ah
when did they ever not lost okay ah to be honest I don't care about the other fish in the ocean ah but but the west ham game was interesting for me cause I just wanted to see how
arteta
plus minus ah plus minus ah
he knows his a level above everybody else ah no but but K you know there's this two theories of
err two types of players football theory eh two types of players one is the control player one is the chaos player and then there's in in amongst the current modern managers kan
ah the likes of
guardiola
and pochettino and martinez and and brendan rodgers they come from the louis van gaal ah ajax school of control at where
okay if I could if I could describe it this way louis van gaal is a scientist in in in that sense cause
ya no but err no you had you have to look beyond the partisanship let's just look at it from academic perspective ah okay err
he treats everything as available you control all the rest then you can tweak the variable and you can manipulate the variables no
so his main code word is control that's why when he breaks up the training he breaks up into the unit meetings or defence unit meetings midfield unit meetings attacking unit meetings and all of the eleventh place at any one point only three players are allowed to be creative the rest all control players
okay so the more variable you can control the more you can dominate the opponent ah
he does basically ah
there's no such thing as chance okay there's no such thing as chance chance happens cause you allow it to happen ah in other words so this kind that's that's why the possession thing cause me to play hard though if you have the ball the opponents have the ball it's the school louis van gaal school of control
wait then then I have the flip side ah the flip side is you eden clock eden clock
is the direct opposite of that he okay usually merino takes everything that is strong about louis van gaal and finds the witnesses so like louis van gaal takes
the ball without the ball you cannot do anything correct if you have the ball the opponent cannot score and we shift the opponent around cause they have to keep chasing after the ball
using merino flips that upon his head he controlled the ball he controls the match without the ball so he push them into different parts of the pitch which are harmless so that's the typical people have possession you always have to keep the horseshoe U-shape thing ah
bionic inter milan game where they only had seventy eighty percent possession and but inter milan won three main
reject the balls
correct he actively gets rid of the ball cause he his theory is err
the the one who wins the match is the one who makes the most the one who lose the match the one who makes the most mistake and the one who has the ball makes the most mistake that's mourinho
correct so basically people control the ball and he play a low block
the moment they make mistake there's miles and miles of space out there then he go on the counter break he has been quoted saying it's the person who does not make use of the counter attack is stupid cause it's a very powerful tool okay
that is still within the control manager kind of thing
same school but two sides of the coin ah
clock is totally different clock is from the chaos school of mentality the control player will be like someone like michael kerrick zambia lonso
err err schools that kind of control zavi iniesta chaos player
okay so cause he wants the control he's
players would act on instinct he cannot trust okay so err he wants them to think and get it repetitions so become muscle memory okay but clock he wants instinct that's exactly reason why van gaal and cryuff although there are come from the same school they're very different cause
cryuff emphasise more on individual creativity van gaal is strictly team organised by team
clock from the chaos part
he wants passion he wants instinct cause he believes that people at their best when they're in the zone when they're full blood rush rush to the head they have the extra ten per cent edge over the rest they have that ten percent inspiration overdress so
just whack and and
in football team the teams are in the weakest in the transition period so when the first phase second phase third phase forth phase
correct there's a transition period and that is that's when you lose your shape and you have not enough time to recover back into a different transition so that is
what mourinho exploits that is what clock clock exploits except that clock
pushes that to the limit he wants that to happen all the time that's why the high pressing
then the distance travelled to the goal is very little okay so that's why he push up very high where but the distance is little but then you have less space to manoeuvre ah mourinho he lived the gap behind more space to manoeuvre more space to exploit
opposites outside of the spectrum for one klopp
he
klopp denies his space
yes
correct for
swan
ya ya ya swan
mm
but on Android I I don't have a four
I didn't I've never have a

alright so on on the surface level eh on the surface level is like ah
desensitising us to sexualisation so
ten eleven years old kan
eleven years old not wearing ah so
ya it's like in other words it's like my
they are kids and the fact that are adults who actually suggesting these two kids ah and the fact that the kids have parents who agree for them to be dressed like this and act in something like this the fact their parents allow them to act and wear things like this being surrounded by adults
who are videographers cameraman directors and all the extra films on set all the extra on set
and these kids are growing up and thinking this is normal they might even enjoy the attention in real world consequences eh
age story about breaking free from tradition and going against the patriarchy or against oppressive culture that kind of thing lah that's the justification ah so she said you're looking at the superficial thing but you're not looking at the message by the film
philosophical question does the end justify the means if that is your message but in the message you are actually causing some people some children real world ah mental or psychological damage by getting to dress like this in order to act a character like that in behaving in front of people
it's not a sleazy casting call ah
mm mm
kevin spacey serious

you don't comment anything about makeup it's a woman thing
it might not know it but actually you are seeking validation from ah
the speed reservation people you don't think ya then your feed I was thinking to into myself that you're feeding of
pressurising you to look good in this way use this shade of colour that shade of colour and you are happily buying makeup and you're saying that you are in control of yourself and
are not independent thinkers that they are subconsciously being steered in this direction by the media by by societal pressure by the expectation to look something in a certain way

Netflix binging I've I've cleared so many shows just by watching
four five episodes a night on a weekday and I just basically every weeknight I clear four or five episodes so I started off with
when we started listing
use of my time ya ya unfortunately ya
you watch again superb show lah then
correct
yes
what
better call saul correct
I think season two you still have not ah coming to six
he's inherently not a bad person he wants to be a good person he just can't help himself ah ah to take shortcuts and corners like that but the transition from
being jimmy to
saul goodman and the point in time when say screw this I just want to embrace who I am kan uh we still holding up a from certain point of views you ask
morally ambiguous ah but but but ya that that transition to its when when it starts to get really engaging tau when you put yourself in and ask yourself
ah ah ah ah ah it's a psychological phenomenon ah it's not a physical disability actually
ya in a fire self-immolation
okay a'ah a'ah
sheer willpower ah a'ah
mm ya
a'ah a'ah but
you should lah sial dude
have you watch prison break
a whole season or all four all four seasons
followed by the movie
no
what is his name will
he didn't die ya he declared himself gay but he
okay
what why why should that be to you you should be to woman okay but err there's four seasons of prison break followed by a movie
after you watch okay after you watch after you watch the movie then you follow season five
there's a season five and that's the final season
ah so it's a four seasons
movie then season five err
that one on the way their their in the works
okay season fourteen end up somewhere around two thousand twelve or thousand thirteen
ah then the movie then two thousand seventeen they came out with with

ya
oh you go it goes in a clockwise
ah
mm
uh huh
uh huh
so where is
oo
ya ya ya ya ya ya
as long as
a'ah

a'ah a'ah correct
mmhmm
so it's not the
a'ah ya lah ya lah ya lah

okay
so
hi
uh this is madir and this is my speaking partner zaini
um zaini say something
hi okay so let's look at the prompts um
ah
how are you today
okay
okay so let's
ah
okay let's find
okay
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
really that's not that petty
okay
I think okay lah that's that's not that petty I suppose for me if
uh the
oh the person's friends the or who the person hangs out with
like that's usually how I would end up not not liking a person is is damn petty
but uh it's usually how who they choose to hang out with which is very shallow lah but
I suppose um ya
ya
okay
but
still at the back of my mind um
I would I will be too aware of it
and it would definitely affect um you know the person just because of who their friends are
it judgemental it's not it's not even petty anymore it's it's more
it's more petty is more is more judgemental than petty so
ya it will be difficult lah and like and it's it I I know it's it's very sad but yes
ya okay
uh
ha okay
ya
uh huh
uh huh
huh okay
okay actually you know what
you know what I'm gonna do right now I don't wanna talk about I don't want to use this conversation
I wanna talk about something I want to talk about the house
ya okay it's easier for us let's just
what do you think of the house ah
huh
ya ya what do think of the house ah
mmhmm
keep talking ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
I mean for me ya lah I mean it's I do feel
I
I'm a bit far away from from where I'm used to kan like I mean like I've always been living in yishun
and then now moving to tampines so it's a bit
it's a bit different for me lah ya
but I guess it's okay
it's fine
one thing about the house that I really I mean do I do I really love is the fact that it's very
us you know
it's something that we both
initially I had no idea that that you were gonna be okay with the designs
you know what I propose for because it was what I like
you know anything I'm just very lucky that like what I like was what was what you like as well
right
for example like I wanted more
more carpentry stuff in the living room you know what that that that whole feature wall thing
but you know it's just too expensive
mm
ya
ya lah
ya
uh okay you know what I'm gonna go back to the questions lah it was a bit it was kind of slightly easier just now
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
uh huh
uh first one would definitely be wealth
right I want to be not just for me but my entire family you know like want to be
a family that has a lot of wealth property
you know uh really high net worth you know a dynasty a business
where our wealth would just go roll and roll and roll
you know that would last generation upon generations
right not just my family but your family as well like like really rich and powerful family that's the that's the first one mine is quite grand lah
and then the second
would be obviously
oh but back to the first one like the like the wealth that we that we gain is of legal means right in that we are free from any legal trouble
secondly is definitely to have
health
hmm
mm
like would be health
um you know basically virus free
you know strong right perfect bodies
uh and then the third one right
that you know same sex relationship is not a problem at all
so you can basically live together you know
um
you know what I think I want to talk about our house
you know we started off from here
and it became like one
ya
ya
ya
not no what I'm saying is this is is is not that it is
if is small I mean it is
I would have imagined it to be slightly bigger but it is not
you know
no no no I just wanted to
the only lah but the buttons ge ge which is good lah
ya but it's okay it's not that bad
ya
ya honestly
I was kinda glad that the
me
I choose it
I wanted the the
are you sure
hmm
iran
yang paling digemari
you know it was an option that you know that I didn't even pick you picked it
you know and I thought it was just interesting you know because I've never been to iran and the idea was just intriguing
I I had zero expectation of iran in fact I'm not like when you were planning the whole thing I will just like mm ya okay and I just
I just wanted to like okay let's try something new
same ya
ya so when we reached there it was it was
ya ya ya ya ya that one was nice that was really really nice you know when we woke up in the morning and then
um we we woke up in the morning and then you know there was a whole sunlight and everything
so that was really nice and
mm where they were that was really really very nice and then um
you know it was just interesting it's just that I think it was an it was a really unfortunate when when when we went tehran
we didn't have a guide like what we had uh in isfahan and yazd
eh no no no we didn't have yazd it's shiraz sorry ya
but
ya lah we didn't have a guide lah
would have been nice lah if we had a guide ah but we didn't have a guide
ya
no the that point of time I was I wasn't I was freelancing so I had a lot of time
huh
ya ya he had a wedding to go to
okay so that was the most interesting trip
but what was the most memorable trip
but you went to bordeaux so many times
oh ya
mm
cranny
mmhmm
uh biarritz
no yes we did we went to biarritz we went to cannes
yes
then from bordeaux we went ya we went to uh dune du pilat
and then we went to biarritz
ya and then we went to arcachon ya
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
uh huh
I think
for me it's the built
first
right I'm okay with looks
ya
I mean I mean of course lah it has to be attractive in my way lah
right ya
I like the physical appeal first right and then the face
hmm and you know the person's kind of vibe ah not not not personality or character lah because I think that's just a stretch
ya
there's too much to think about the but there has to be like some sort like I'm I'm attracted to I guess to to many kinds of personalities and characters but
you know it's that person's vibe can I
deal with like you know you and I we have very different personalities
right we have quite a opposing personalities and we are quite and we're very very different people but
you know the fact that we actually can
we do have a certain chemistry
I mean we do have chemistry with each other and we we vibe well ah
ya
is this is actually very difficult
like this conversation thing to code switch is actually very difficult like I find myself like when I'm very conscious of what I'm speaking that I'm speaking I tend to break out more I mean it it's very natural for me to speak in english
even when I'm speaking malay
normally I suppose right I
I often pepper the words with
pepper the sentences with with with english words because sometimes it's just so much easier to express something in english
you know ya because
ya like the word
like for example like to say to express feeling
right is it feels much easier and it feels less awkward
ya it just feels much easier it just feels less emotional
I'm about to really go deep
yes ya
yes
eh no wait we have reached twenty four mark the twenty four the twenty fourth minute mark
wait does it have to be one hour
I suppose so
soalan pertama fahamkan anda
no
I'm asking you
if you can okay if you can attain three skills if you can instantly attain three skills what would those would those three skills be
being frugal is not a skill
a skill what can you do with your hand
mmhmm okay
why
uh huh
ah okay
uh huh
uh
um
design
uh
um
accounting
accounting
accounting ya
so that I can become an electrician so that I can fix my own things
you know
and I I think those three skills would be
most
uh would be most useful
I believe
okay
okay
okay so that's question okay so let's look at another prompter
you are dining at a new restaurant called karma it doesn't have a menu you simply get what you deserve
what food will you be served
okay okay that's a dumb question um
okay
uh
uh
uh talented
I have no idea what talented means uh is in in in malay um
uh
ya tom holland
mmhmm
ah
uh huh
actually
uh huh
okay um
I think what this exercise is is trying to trying to
study is how like when you're having a conversation how do we code switch right
because you know we are both singaporeans we both speak the same languages right um how
the mastery level
you know our mastery level at the language at at the language is is completely secondary
you know so I think they just want to find out like
I think I think the whole purpose of this is trying to find like is trying to figure out the trigger points
right
and actually collect data
as to when
um
code switching
ya because
sometimes okay sometimes okay what I find such studies very interesting because they like
such research very interesting
when
no no no you have to you have to you have to understand because
they have to list like an entire conversation right if if we were to speak fifteen minutes there's not enough data there's they can't really detect you know like enough patterns
right if it's just
fifteen seconds it can be a brief conversation you know it's
when you speak to someone for an hour okay yes a force could um not force it's a bit forced I get you you know is one hour it's a bit forced
right but it's okay
it's okay
ya
it's okay and but the thing is it's I think they just want to see patterns
you know they want to see patterns and if one hour I suppose give them ample um opportunities to mine
you know as much as as much data as they can
ya
the difficulty in us maintaining in this is is actually in in in is actually the maintaining of this conversation
right and consciously trying to code switch
when in normal situation
it's something that we do unconsciously
right we just do it and that it's it's something that we don't really think about our
be be even aware of
you know like
um
like when we are with our friends you know then when we talk
I mean we don't really think about and then we just we we either just continue what we're saying in malay or we just continue what we're saying in english you know
I think the difficult part is that whole start stop thing and the fact that they made us watch this video
right
they made a number of us watch this video and then they kinda give guidelines
as to how I hope you're listening to this by the way and they give us guidelines on how to
um
on what makes a good code switching or bad code switching and that kinds of kind of like
you know uh make us a bit too conscious so I feel that this conversation feels a bit forced and to a certain and to a certain degree uh unnatural
you know
I feel that if there was no not much of restriction
and
ya
we actually made it to forty minutes you know
okay cleaning done wah
actually I'm kinda glad that
the other colour
ya
ya
then when we only pick one
so glad we pick the the nicer the the darker one because it's actually much nicer
yes
ya
ah oh
we can go later we can go tomorrow
yup
okay so okay
ya
I kinda like it though
it kinda looks more like uh rustic to me
okay
actually kan
I was imagining the the counter top to be
if you tell me I'm not saying it's not okay it's okay obviously it's okay but I was imagining it to be thinner
eh thicker
ya okay let's let's look at another question it's quite interesting like suddenly ah
no no no one dish
ya
yes
okay
just like you
I have two choices
um
uh
I can eat that I think for every single meal
you know
it is such a perfect meal it is not a balanced meal
but it is a perfect meal
you know it is one of the my most favourite things in the world
okay
I love it so much in fact
ya
ya but back to our house I actually cannot believe that you know that this is going to be our place
just
you know the wall
actually I was thinking ah like dining area
or just this wall
just this wall
the store wall
okay lah
okay lah just leave it plain lah then I can put paintings
no lah I honestly I I don't like lah I mean like
not not the wall lah
eh
eh

okay
wallpaper-wallpaper design

just take a look
ya ya ya we wanna change ya we wanna change in february
february is soon by the way
ah
wah

alright alright
few walks away so it's not really much of a big distance for us to cover
ya the kampung with the malays ya that place
no lah I think for them maybe is about
okay so six get already then after that we err
err until six thirty five then
yes
censored ya so sulaiman was there to pee lah then after that err not long after that lah my turn my turn because for us there's nothing much to do so all we do is go up there
drink lots of water so sulaiman will have a sweeter taste because he
drank lemon tea I I brought my dasani and then we just drink drink drink and for sulaiman he only peed once I peed
enjoy the enjoy
ya
that's life that's life
I see I see so so
sorry
ah
ah
uh huh
mm mm
seven ah ah mm
mm mm
pulau ketam lah
so you mean basically the uncle brought you from changi all the way to pulau ketam
so you mean to the jetty then taxi van mm
ya lah cause the way you say was like did I did I skip the taxi thing or like
ah
mmhmm
mm seriously
how sia
like saw sia
aduh aduh okay so the crabs err
ah
no fish no crab ah ah ah
mm mm mm mm mm
eh eh ah okay
wah same man wan five give me high five
mm okay alright so this wan one ah ah
supper Milo
one of a kind
wait the context this is taking place at where again
ah
mm mm uh uh
mm
mm mm
mmhmm
uh huh
mm
ah okay but three mm okay
okay carry on carry on
mm
mm mm
mm
mm mm
ah
ah ah I need to remember but ya mmhmm
mm
daring daring
mm mm
mm
mm
mm mm mm
ish ish mm mmhmm mmhmm
ish ish of course not nice
three three testing ah sometimes sometimes sometimes testing one two three
okay so I'm thinking of another place
I don't know if I've been there you see ah uh huh ah
oh the tip okay so for me
the reason I asked about the two storey building is because if you go there you will see the side
so you would be able to see the side of pulau ketam from one end to the other so I think your area might be a little further further in lah maybe a place I've never been in before lah
oo that's a distance I think we should I think
I think your end will be closer to punggol to already
orh aduh so okay okay now I remember I think this story many people say before you kayak in front don't don't
oh here comes the big one and uh instructor instructor I cannot move instructor got current
I can't instructor I don't know why I'm moving towards the angler
alright so that's your pulau ubin story thank you so almost for sharing
err time check this one I can say because you say I can say anything it is twenty five minutes in so we are actually err after the one third mark
and the ya I don't know if it I think on my end my english is quite a lot lah I think your end your malay quite a lot so hopefully can balance a bit lah ya
I mean now we can also fix our mistake
lah kan lah kan eh yeah
okay what else you wanna talk about
my past few months ah ah
okay so for now the same thing lah just keep trying your luck to apply for all these jobs and see which one can can go for err I've considered to deliver food
but I think for the time being err more of a full time thing should be something I should focus on lah
I think slowly lah eh because we do full time and at least your income is kind of more fixed lah I mean I know Grab you will be able to earn more but you need to work more lah ya so just err pros and cons I think for now really my mindset is to make sure that I can understand what I'm supposed to do
err with my life then understand where are what are my interest what are my passion
then work on it work on those skills then inshallah when february comes send again this time to all the six autonomous universities to see whichever one is related to sociology or political science
and then just try my luck lah then at least in that moment if I already have a full time job I apply I still have a job
then after that err it's just whether or not approve or not if approve I alhamdullilah I can say okay I'm going to go for my uni thank you for the opportunity bye bye
and then after that that's it lah if if if cannot then at least I already have a job then I will just continue till the next application lah
err wah cannot I cannot think that means a lot already lah
err
okay
so far the the industry I've been I've I've err sent for has been
err civil service err healthcare err cleaning err
around those lah is is just those industries basically industries that if possible avoid phone call lah
ya lah so that's why if I speak malay I english all the way is okay then the rest all malay all together level out fifty fifty
the rejection is the best part ah silence which is the most annoying part because technically eh by right the most professional way for is
at caldecott area there err more of central macritchie lah macritchie reservoir ah so it's there
then err then
and then she said okay that's very good that's very good then after that err we'll just keep in touch err within the week we'll call you back
err with every passing day err when the doesn't want to get back to you the more you feel kinda suck-ish lah like are you just playing my feelings want to play my feelings ah playing my heart
ah
so
so okay so basically err
then
ya so so that's the story lah the middle person err
err eventually was someone that I met prior to this so we had a meeting before and he knows that I can do posters based on my blog
my number to this err communications officer lah then err after that
is fandi ahmad fandi ahmad
forum panel discussion you have your moderator your speaker your guest speaker
ya so that's why I was taken aback by that kind of comment lah so okay err I mean I try not to make a fuss too much I said okay never mind I will change it I will just put everything in one line
then mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
you know because for my for me err the the thing is me and this err officer
eh not call lah Whatsapp me say eh sorry shazwan we have to bring it down because the people might find it offensive
cartoon is literally the same image that I worked on
err so the officer said
so here's the thing
is volunteering because the guy that handed my number to the officer
and suddenly a pause a long message later by the way if I may in future
please consult me before handing my numbers to people and then I just say lah err it's unprofessional this kind of thing all these then I said I did not know that I was supposed to be involved in this event at all which is the truth
ya lah
ya lah ya lah ya
ya lah so I think the the thing about this is that the forum the the main theme of the forum is communication
that's why mm yes mm
the video lah kan the video
uh
mm mm mm ya
ah aduh
some more if it's free
if you want to pay if you're not paying someone and then you're asking someone to be so professional it doesn't make sense lah because the person will give you half ass work because you're not even giving half ass pay
giving pay
mm mm mm
mm
mmhmm mm mm mm
err no sorry by by way or the highway but give me your pay
heartbroken everybody is heartbroken feelings feelings tonight we got many feelings err time check forty five minutes congratulations we are now going to have fifteen more minute left then after that we will
say our goodbyes alright I hope
err the fishing ah the fishing mine in the beginning right we already talk so that's why we like awkward a bit now now still awkward lah cause now we talking to you it's just
today is not we today we cannot say
err we for muslims we start our days
at the at sunset
at night
but our day starts at night yes our night is actually the the the
the beginning oh damn
so yes err these are all the topics that we like to discuss you know we've been talking with each other but hey you are a
listener
best per month pe not like the whole internship
yes uh
uh uh okay
ah okay okay highest
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm
ah
mm mm
is it is it mm mm
then alamak
mm mm
then you you you the man you lead my country
I don't need to worry too much you you you do your thing I do mine
so hopefully for you listeners out there I don't even know if you will listen or use it straight to the machine the will have to understand cause if they have to understand man eh
mm mm mmhmm

his soon to be wife
then what about your friend the toxic another one

mmhmm
for me ah cause to be honest you told me about her ex right like the ex cheat on her then always use her money all these then like why would you want to be with someone like that some more certis cisco you know it's not a stable job you earn a lot of money only cause you um and is very the timetable very rabak so if you date someone like that you can only go out with them at night like that
and most of their days is very busy what so I'm like just go for the guy lah he seems like a better choice but then if she really cannot wait for two years then I feel like she should just let go of the guy cause he deserves better imagine you with someone then you keep on thinking why I have to go through this again bastard sia the guy can could've find someone better what
then
what she want to do now
it's a new relationship and you already keep arguing like that it's a red flag though just tell her to get back with her ex lah
cause he doesn't sound good
I think my boyfriend would beat him up sia
then
how did the new guy react
mmhmm
okay
then tell her find new guys block both of these two
but I think right your friend loves all this drama and attention that's why she's doing nothing to stop it
if a lot of guys fight over you oh why like so flower like that

I think they like don't care don't care like that ah
just like the donald trump say right um there can be no coronavirus cases if you don't get checked

ya he got the trump trump golf club or something oh and you know fun fact when he go visit other countries for like conference all this he will only go to his own golf club
so like so like he earn more lah you get it because when he go to his own that one then the his other like guests like this will also go with him what so more business for him lah in a sense
ya now the country is like whole ass movie sia like parody movie like that
huh that long meh I think two years ago what no meh
oh four years
ugh rabak
rabak sial
ya keep on every month also got new drama from him

okay I think we're recording
err so my name is Umar and my conversation partner today is
so
so okay obviously okay I start eh so basically um
then after that um when we heard about this corona virus issue actually I was in Jakarta err celebrating Chinese new year lah
um the the the hype so called or the whole issue err it it went up and then
it was a paranoia or something but when I came back to Singapore um and then I slowly see Singapore move to orange alert and then um the whole of Singapore they were taking it very seriously
and uh at first I was going to work and slowly um you see more and more people
um we were eventually taken over by um okay eh at first it was China lah and then second it was Singapore
at first ah this is the global ranking towards it got worse in certain countries uh in Italy
is the highest lah so Singapore although we had our ups and downs but it looks like we are getting better
err but that's how I remembered my experience um when it first started err and how at that point of time I was
let's put it like um I wasn't employed anymore err after this whole situation so now looking for job lah
some authority figure ah
you know
I'm just okay
ya she more or less got a big
ya and
I think
and say that uh you sorry you didn't intend for this to happen err
at least apologize even though you're right even if you think you're right even if you are right just apologize let's say err I understand
ridiculous thing that happened during this whole COVID situation that err gone viral for no reason
um
Hadi dresses exactly the same as that guy
so ya no no okay exactly okay so when I see Hadi kan
last time when he was riding panda Foodpanda he just stop by my place once in a while for smoke or something
that's why I tagged him and a lot of people thought that I was insinuating that that was him
so that was quite funny ah but I saw the article lah I think Mothership covered this article about him
okay my input is okay first of all
the thing about that whole situation is it's not about him per se but what he symbolizes kan
because if you think about it um just the fact that during this whole uh circuit breaker period and the contributions they did
err actually it is it is the symbol you know it it's not just the fact that it's Foodpanda but it's also the fact that
err the unsung heroes has to unofficially be there to be recognized
mm mm
mm well I have this opinion about uh all these food delivery ah so to my understanding ah
but err food delivery eh so I feel that um it is a way to bridge the income gap from the lower income to the higher income and here is why okay first of all um
and they are blue err blue collar workers kan so think about this for a second eh to be a food delivery rider and all these you don't need qualification you don't need to go for an interview
you don't need to um like basically if you apply kan most likely you will accept
and you don't need a qualification it doesn't matter whether you N level you're O level you're A level you're university degree masters doesn't matter
you still get treated the same the way that you do things it all depends on your effort
so I thought it's really good if you think about it is a way for uh the lower income group to catch up
the chances are a lot of this food delivery a lot of richer people higher income people
they will will be doing this deliveries and then they will passing on the money to the lower income who is most likely doing it kan so if you think about it
it's a way for the blue collar workers to get a white collar err job salary and it will help bridge the income
also if you think about this one thing I like about err food delivery also it requires no interview no experience
and she earns only about thirty six dollars a day lah for example on her electric err wheelchair and stuff like that delivering food and because
but the fact that she can make that small amount of money no matter how small it is ah okay and maybe people might tip her or something I don't know
but the fact is um you can it it it can it lets you stand on your own two feet lah
relying on people or even when you can't get a job at all maybe you have some sort of special needs or special syndrome food delivery
people hope because there's no need for interview imagine if she is looking to err
you know you need to interview but food delivery it doesn't matter whether you have a masters degree you have O level or you are in a wheelchair
so
ya you need to write sheet down together your thoughts but anyway um with regards to that uh there are some people who are like that as well
and I guess the good thing about this panda thing is it's quite an indiscrimination kind of
err err employment
your gender stuff like that but in this case also it it it it doesn't discriminate your education level as well
which is something that has a high emphasis lah in singapore so whether you are uh as mentioned before whether you are
err low educated or highly educated you still earn the same it depends on how much work was actually done and when you think about it is it something like
because of so much flexibility in your timing you get to decide kan
so the last time there is so much flexibility in this kind of work is a taxi driver so taxi driver I assure you should know my dad is a taxi driver kan
so basically the only commitment you need is you go out and then you grab err you pick up passenger and then that commitment is between
your err err picking up the passenger to dropping them off but
here's the thing right so with taxi the commitment is you have to pay for rental hundred dollars a day so
so for this drivers they have to actually make sure they earn at least hundred dollars after they earn the hundred dollars whatever they earn is theirs
meaning to say actually let's say you
chose a bicycle and you really err let's say you already have a bicycle lah let's say you choose a bicycle and you want to do this delivery
whatever you deliver whatever food panda give you that is exactly what you get in your pocket is much easier to calculate
so it it simplifies a little bit
so you can calculate very easily rather than having to go through the process and it cuts down the stress basically if you decided
and then you already made two deliveries you want to go home you can go home you don't have that stress of
it has that sort of it extended flexibility ah and I don't think a lot of Singaporeans see it this way lah it's just something I just thought about recently
maybe err do a three hour trip err three hour or four hour or five six trips
then go home lah so you have that extra income cash it go straight to your bank account
uh as opposed to waiting at the end of the month that kind of thing you know it's instant so it it it is something that um a lot of
the there's a lot of factors why it is such uh active um kind of employment especially for the lower income uh people to help a bridge to the higher income people
well it's not like we have a focus so it's okay
okay I think we will stop for about half an hour so
what
okay
err it does
um so during the circuit breaker period of pe was it two months
I think it was two months
so how how were you coping what were you doing um did you
actually even go out at all did you do a lot of food delivery err did you meet anyone or
oh okay nevermind
but won't they make you have the camera turn on
okay another question what is stopping you from hiring someone to do the exam for you
no lah if you have forty eight hours and you know what exam it is you can prep what you don't have to get it within the forty eight hours
you can prep earlier on and say eh I'm doing this err exam err next week
err I pay you two hundred dollars lah just come to my house you sit in front and then you do for me okay pe
seriously
right well characters is something inevitable
brief shallow comparison between school and work I would say that
I think also it depends on school as well ah because when I was in uni uh um a lot of people who went to like me kan they err
towards at the end of the year one big major exam
so in a way you can balance oh out you can you know work together and you know maybe you are not the most academically inclined
and it can help make you up it it's a little bit a balance of both but err
sometimes err if you want things you've got to do it yourself you want to get things done
there is more to life than giving your girlfriend or girlfriend twenty three gifts my goodness save save the money
anyway you are broke so anyway I think the difference between your classmate and you is that you have been at least out in the working world
err for a couple of years you actually um understand and appreciate what err higher academia can bring compared
to your peers err in school at the moment kan even for myself kan if you ask me to go to school now and I were to go to school and um if I really want it
I think I would be able to have that kind of motivation because you know what it where where it can bring you
and you know that the results or uh it it it you will you more or less know what will happen if you don't do well you more or less know what happen when you do well
so for them they don't know they don't know exactly what they are the consequences of not
getting a respectable grade it it hasn't hit them yet so I can understand I mean we were all once students who I mean even yourself when you were in poly
um you know it's the uncertainty of err okay lah
you know if I don't do well then don't do well lah you know but uh once you are in a position where you are out
is very exhausting and um some of my friends did try that route
and they were successful err well kudos them
but social life go all the way no problem
she knows she knows
you probably deserve it you probably deserve it anyway please continue
there's some people like myself better focused when not at home and distracted by I don't know
snacks lah toilet lah
you actually groom yourself you know you comb your hair and then
you go out you take a shower and then you feel refreshed take coffee and then you're ready to get on the go so some people um
the productivity for some people such as myself is not so good to be honest
err I don't know for me it would be doubly hard
um if doubly is even a word for studying
so aiya I mean so
I don't know eh ultimately it is a state of mind lah so if you are in that state of mind and you of course you have to have discipline also
when you order you still when you order food you still need to
pay someone has to pay say you pay or your family pay
but if you are on Foodpanda there's a system called panda pro where you pay like
eight dollars ninety cent a month or something like that and you get like twenty deliveries
it's really a good deal okay you you check it out you go to Google you just type err Foodpanda pro
ten dollars and you get five deliveries that's already two dollars per delivery
so I I don't know why not more people are not into it a lot of people do ala carte
circuit breaker I wasn't sure but err if you go now it's definitely available
its not like ya most offices are still closed
most people stay at home during this whole period until until the end of the year
well ya well Nurul didn't even have a break in the first place she is an essential worker lah so it's a different story but for those people who
suspect until the end of the year ah
personally I think if at the by the end of the year I manage to go one vacation I'm actually more or less quite happy already
I went this year I went Jakarta once only
that was the only overseas trip I did this year
what the the the thing happened in February ya the thing happened in February what
it was very fast
ya well I think also because in err late January it was Chinese new year I had to go Jakarta but I think we were supposed
to go I mean I was scheduled to go for another vacation I think in May or
no not May err April or something ah it didn't happen anyway so ah whatever lah
just need a break cause okay if you think about it kan people other than Singapore
who
ah that one is err he was so desperate for diving that one also is
ya
yup
nope it says err fifty seven minutes
on my timer
ya
so man I don't know now
you you're only as old as you feel
sleep is for the weak having said that I got a class tomorrow at nine thirty
what am I doing recording this at two in the morning
you you go for more class I'm going for volunteer class you are going for to get re-educated upgrade education
you paid for
I use I use the SkillsFuture is paid for
I still had to pay about err thirty plus dollars that's all just uh a top up ah
twenty five thousand dollars ah jer
I paid more for my education in my uni hello
but but I already paid my loan so I'm good no problem
what I'm done but at this stage I already have it so I'm good
no problem
ya I don't have a loan now also I am done
hmm
how many years have I been working six maybe should be longer but I had a lot of breaks in between
it's okay
I enjoy my life well how how how do you want why are we talking about this while the thing is recording we have thirty more seconds
okay at this point but did they say though it must be exactly one hour or about one hour

um
ah so you say you like shopping right so what type of things you like to shop
uh huh
so other than
when you
ah yes so is so now when you see for yourself eh actually if I do this way it it also can be done so it's your own way of doing things
ah I enjoy eating it which is something good lah kan hopefully
you can cook ah more things lah
ah exercise more ah exercise more in the imagination lah in reality I won't exercise
ah yes I like to play football last time and that was last time maybe
eh this year what thirty nine
maybe ten years ago I think ya lah ten years ago still can play lah but now I think it'd be better
got injuries there injuries here so don't really got chance to to play ah maybe
ah if I play football with
ah I become a soccer coach
if I did
if I do become lah
doubt so lah I think I prefer to read up about it
and watch about it lah don't want to waste my energy ah
during the malaysia cup ah
the atmosphere to get back to the malaysia cup days is is
is over lah first of all is the
priorities
and the lifestyle it has changed
in fact can say the whole
mix too much mix
that we don't know who is who
ah whom is like
and the passion is just not there lah I mean even if
I think even if let's say if singapore is to continue with the malaysia cup until now
I think the interest will also die off
because
think is not of just about the facilities ah
the atmosphere will come
the thing is the passion is not there because of why because of lifestyle last time
ah football
and basically the basic things to play so basically is
when you play football it's really to
for the money for the fame kan then there are
then why you I want to play football in the
ah in the basketball court or in the
football court when I can just relax and play at FIFA right
ah I can just ah imagine myself to be ronaldo or messi
on the screen
kan if I feel like I want to stop a while I just pause
when last time when you play
and to or wait for it to fire up then you can go in now basically
you are on the move the internet is all in your fingers kan
how come last time when people make appointment only handphone just via phone call or what
or say okay I meet I meet you here at this timing no phone call no nothing
yet we can be on time
you can basically
contact with the with the people
yet you are late
you can message people yet you cannot find the place you know all this kind of things ah um
uh huh
yes
ya so that is the different lah people change
kan so maybe certain things will be left behind lah
ah
ah
ah
ah
we have to be adaptable
try to change
to keep up with the time lah kan cause if not you are going to have issues if let's say you are going to still be
ah impossible ah kan ah
okay um
yes
ah behind kan then our kid will be affected so we have to
we understand that we have to be up to date no need to be so advanced but
ah just nice for his ah
or his or her development
in the future lah even now in school like you have to do
learning at home studying at home using the internet
ah ah
yes correct
ah
um
ah
ya lah
the thing that we enjoy
to do together I think we can talk about our travel
ah
ah but in terms of travelling
ah malaysia kan
ah ah maybe thailand and
indonesia and australia ah
hoping to cover all ASEAN countries
but unfortunately because of the COVID
ah um
ah favourite place ah favourite place
not much changes compared to living in singapore as but of course the price is
much lower okay lah our singapore dollar is strong lah then
do our one year shopping of
of clothes maybe kan
but it's a really complete
uh shopping lah
for the clothes only lah
ah
ah
ah
nitty-gritty details
then maybe you are okay I not okay kan but of course there is there different lah when you go travelling as a honeymoon is is is different because it's still something new kan but I think if now we are to go to the same place
the feeling will be different cause the understanding is more
is ah is stronger and then I think you will enjoy it more
our kid also will enjoy it more also lah kan
uh but
yes ah
ah ya lah you will set the goal when you go ah
ah ah
ah I think it's not only the
prompt reaction part lah kan
I mean
ya lah I think certain things you are more
ah
comfortable in handling and
ah certain things I am more comfortable in handling lah I mean in terms of money I think you are more comfortable and you do the money part
ya for me is I am more comfortable in
ah planning
I enjoy the I enjoy planning and seeing that things goes smoothly ah
ah ah ah
ah ah
ya lah ah when authoritative-ness then
people don't argue with you
but if the other party decide to fight back with you
ah then you will go back go back go back and then you won't be in front
ah
ya because generally I am not that
picky
I'm not that particular as long as it's okay lah
ah
we are realistic lah kan what we what we pay for is what we suppose to get
but sometimes for me it's like
just get things done and over lah I don't want to like waste time on
something maybe to me is small lah but to you is
I pay for it then I want to get it kan so that is the difference
ah ah
ah ya
I think for the jakarta one
when we reach
there we were like eh
first thing is the airport lah
very different we feel like am I back in the eighties and looking at the flooring reminds me of
err shopping centres err in the eighties kan
so okay lah that is one thing then
the other thing is when we walk
uh
ah
I remember when we just came in into the hotel
first is the smell
we feel the it's like the smell of
ah something being kept for so long
it's not rotten ah it's like the carpet never wash for so long
ah lah
quite enjoyable lah in jakarta the
different way of life

that one is the bukit bendera
ah ah yes
ah][ah um)(um
ah ah ah um
ah ah ya
but it was very bad remember that time even then malaysian chief
the prime minister then even though they are from opposition
when we are inside the van kan we can see the certain places which was
ah damaged lah due to the due to the flood
ah then one thing about penang ya I remember which is interesting is that
they like to conserve the old buildings
they conserve so they make it part of the building kan which is ah a bit
but
conserve for the sake of ah conserving ah sometimes it doesn't really look
matching
ya but I I respect them lah cause they did conserve their ah
upside down museum ah um
singapore rediscovery vouchers ah
hopefully it's worth it
life go back a bit more to normal ah then we can start our travelling plans at least travel plans doubt so lah other countries we cannot control kan
but hopefully in singapore we can can do it lah eh
at least meet up so we won't be so
ah no new cases ah

so other than that for me is err ah
I got a lot of things to be done
a lot of things need to move on
ah maybe some things need to get rid of and move slowly
but I still have to
ya it's going to be a bit
complicated lah trying to move a lot of things then we basically our situation we are like
I will go with the majority lah and if let's say out of ten person
then because of you one or two person don't agree I will move on with the eight
the nine and ten person who you want to follow you follow if not if you are in trouble what you have to face it yourself don't like you face you have issue oh then you look for me ask me for a solution and all that of course if I am if I can
ah

a'ah
mm
ah
ah yes
ah
ah
ah yes
ah cousin ah
things are moving smoothly if I only can try my best lah
I I submit document I submit application

ah
the thing is is like that
because they are two different
organisation if they are under one
organisation of course it's smoother lah kan
have to go through a lot of places lah
the future
you have to go through a certain
authorised by us to do the ah assessment so go through check up again
so um um
ah ah
are done are simplified that means only one time check and then it's done kan
settle

meaningful lah that is what
ah
ah

okay lah I mean it's not that tiring
something I wanna do
two to three years down the road
then I can take like
until like
from there or something
ya
ya it's important it's important to have smart goals you know
what do you mean
five to four days a week ah
so
and I'm so taking my part time degree so
quite tiring
so whenever I've
when school starts then whenever I've
free time then I try my best to run lah
and
uh and
you know my job
like
they

I mean this field is quite underpaid lah so I'm trying to find jobs that I can you know
like
secure myself financially
um
maybe
yours also I heard it's not two K right
mmhmm
the internet also they want experience as I mean like I don't know how am I supposed to find a starting job to get all these experiences in a good company
I mean it's it's common lah
but
everywhere now you go like you need experience and this you know
for people like us
but I hope I hope you do find you know job that you can be you know
stable financially you know support your parents you know that
honestly
super hard you like
about hundred percent ten per cent jer companies who does that
like they
they don't appreciate you they
once you do something bad
it tarnishes your whole reputation
everything your hard work all gone
focuses on your
ah employees welfare
you know and job progression is super important
job progression
yes sure
wow
that's unfair
how old is she
she's two years younger and she's the head of your
team
wah that's a bit unfair
orh it's this happens a lot you know politics in the company and
I mean there are no
chances that
the moment you change companies I mean change jobs
it's gonna be perfect you still gonna face this kind of
issues you know work life issues and
I don't know lah this life that's
that sucks but
it's important nowadays that
company
you know take into account
I mean that's why
um
exist
ya so and anything complain jer
ya with no power to change
nothing no control over
you know this kind of things
you know
I am a student care teacher
err basically I just supervise the kids lah
um you know
make sure ensure
their safety is well taken care of hygiene
and you know we're
make sure they stick to their routine
and then mark their assessment books
but the funny thing is
my boss said that
um
they're not academically inclined
but
when the kid
read books
at certain timing
they get scolded
because their assessment books are
incomplete
a moment later you're there changing the
the student care and
when you
eat also you wanna talk
you can't
homework
like
ya
exactly
student care
care
for a reason right need to care
and because you drink water already just now so like you have to stay in the room for an hour without drink water without any toilet breaks
yup and you do homework
and there's no nap time
they know the the funny thing is they know the timetable
and they know what they have been doing
but
torturing so
a lot of people
a lot
that's the thing
ya and I can't even laugh with them
I can't even
talk to them
like
in all the time
that's the thing you just imagine yourself in student care
can you imagine
I mean like no one to control you and all that you just do your own things your parents don't force it upon you I mean we do get guidance
but it's more of a freedom of choice
we were allowed to make
choices
and now we become adults
who knows how to make
spoon feed around and then like they grow up becoming like
okay what do I do now
was that a routine no
you know that kind of thing
okay lah I mean like this generation is different from back then
okay how about your job scope
I wanna know
it's okay just tell me
oh ya I did oh my god I miss her so much um
her wedding okay she just move out recently
and ah I met man the house so so empty
and
and ya lah
and all that ya
but
I don't know I'm happy for her
ya that's like
I mean like
nowadays um
you know when you find a soulmate you know you just
you just
it's important to go with the flow you know
like
not forced upon it
not
find it you know once you stop finding for it then things
come
ya that kind of thing
but I heard you and your
your boyfriend has been together for
for years right

mm
is it but are you the clingy type of person or like
I see

till married so wait okay
K
now I need to ask you important question

okay lah I mean like we are still young and he is also still young he is in right so you get your freedom now
I mean get your own space get your own time get to talk to me
okay lah take your time take your time
ya that's true
you know
life has no template they say
you know
there's no schedule so
go with the flow
oh I love that
I need to write that's
a perfect quote
um me and my family okay
I don't know eh I mean like I'm so used to being the second child
and like you know there no responsibilities we still have eh have fun and enjoy and when then now that
my older sister is gone
like
they're relying on me
so
I I think I have to be the bigger person right now but I'm still coping cause I don't know how
I don't know I'm really I'm lost
but
okay lah slowly slowly maybe I get to learn stuff
but I'm still at a stage whereby
I focus on myself a lot
and I'm scared that
you know I might
I might
lose
the responsibility
I mean like
how about that okay
give me some tips
since you are the older child
oh man
I saw this post and they said that um
the first child
and then and gradually the second third child right it
it kind of
um ya pass off so
but at the same time you you are nurtured
um
how to say not perfect but then
better better than the second and
third lah
so that's why like I'm lost right now but then you are the eldest we're like okay okay I get this right I get that right
so ya lah are the pros and cons
but
I I hope you know your brothers you know we learn from you you know as a role model because I look up to you also
cringe
mm
that's true
that's true
and no wonder I'm friends with you
um okay talking about sweet right
I scared leh I scared of diabetes
um
then like
then like
there is signs of you
that get
like
my my grandma is both sides grandma my
diabetic
his deserts you
of course
but
have you heard of it the
ants
oh my
I'm sorry
the heart the sugar intake is quite high lah
but
okay the thing I am confused about right
like
they say it's not the sugar but it's actually the carbo
because it's
okay like okay
basically if you are
diabetic right you have to eat low food
glycemic index
glycemic index and high glycemic index comes from rice
white rice
white rice high okay where is the sugar that's that's the thing people get confused about sugar or
carbs
and then I I went to research about it
actually it's true
like
rice is the cause of it
and you know like
things that are that are easily processed
but you if you eat whole grain
is lower
lower so that you
the sugar tends to break down slower so that
to combat the sugar
except for white rice and
mm
then you think we are malays is in we eat
okay like
rice is a staple food for us
I mean I don't mind eating salad
but
the options
I mean you can get back that at subway at what eight dollars for salad
you save so much
one to two days
wah this is
is quite hard
ya that's true
I mean I've seen a lot of people you know having hard time coping that's why you know like
like why can't you just love is free yes
okay love is free
I think like we're at that age
where everything is just hard
is it a twenty two
no no no
twenty two curse
her
grandfather
and then drove back home
and left him there
malaysia lah
singapore
intention
yes they don't want to take responsibility for him
and then um they receive a phone call from the dad um the dad call another lah his son lah another son
then went there
and he said the father said okay me home lah then then they say like oh it's okay we come next week
again because it's late
they went back
and their father pass away
the father say it's okay I can live in your store room also
the father pass away
but ya it does exist
and you know the kid is traumatised because of what's happening you know this kind of thing all affect
the the kids ya
you know
that's true that's true
I mean like
you wouldn't realise that you actually following your parents but then because if they watching it all your life and is this rooted in you
you know and
there's such thing called karma
so you treat your parents like that your your son your daughters gonna treat same thing same way you treat your parents so ya that's why I'm scared I really had to take care of my parents not because it's not just because of karma
safety is vector
but it's actually quite good leh
because
of um
you know
the occurring the occurrence of
dementia
so ah
how old is she now
but the around
oo
I think more the the the the over sixty five lah
definition of
you know just having the freedom to go out you know like breathe I I mean like if I'm her also I will
no fresh air I'll be like
lonely at least we go out where you'll get to people watch you know
just watch people walk
and
I I enjoy people watching honestly so I can relate to your grandma
oo that I like the question mm
um I
think kan I would
probably would love
love
to
just
um
around
okay ah
paris area
london because
is it so rushing
I have heard a lot of people saying that
the rest of them are chilling as well
I want that kind of environment you know just to experience
being chillax you know um
ya lah but that's my goal lah
just
ya you how about you
like literally you know
there's something very intriguing about
their culture the way they relax I don't know
I feel like singapore just need to chill a bit lah
it's just too fast pace but
but
ya lah
and like
people like us
so I feel like it's
quite important to just
kind of chill
and take a step back
but you know who are we to control kan
I mean it's not weird I mean
it's valid
for you to feel that way because
if me I wouldn't be able to
cope with five kids
god but like
I don't know and
okay if you are in the country or if you're wealthy it's a different thing but then we are in singapore you know
five times five
if I have a high paying job I don't mind
but then what
what are the odds you know you don't know
and
five kids is a lot
a lot to juggle I can't even handle like one
crying baby
why
how
mm
we're like that okay
but
I feel like ya I mean like if you have
something to work towards to
I mean you get motivated what
in certain way
but
but
it all
comes back to being success successful in the end
she's now why we have to pay ourself
are you planning to take any courses in the future I mean like apart from your specialist diploma
like degree or something
the fees and everything is it
which uni are you looking at
I mean that's good lah
planning is
everything
honestly I mean like
you don't just
like
eh okay
but like
ya lah
I mean like
so you took one year gap
ya
oh I took a one year gap also
you didn't know after graduation I took a one year gap
ya we did we both did I remember
it's like
think about what you want
actually that's true I mean like you wasted a year
and when your friends are all like progressing already and then you are one year back
so um and when that one year gap makes you lazy actually
makes you very lazy it's because
meant to be
that's why I believe lah so that
I mean if you keep thinking about the one year gap you get depressed eventually
because like you will regret
ya
oh man why didn't you reach out to me
we were have been talking for what seven years and you didn't know I took a one year
gap come on
no I
after I graduated
I work okay
then I
kept up
do they work part time also
I didn't know that
I didn't know that at all
so where do you get the money from
you need like
that's the thing I know you were good at savings I know you had like
wah a lot of saving so you were have been using your savings during that one year gap
pro
pro
pro
oh my
god okay okay but not to make you depressed or anything it's okay it's okay things happens for a reason I mean you are not where you are right now
if it wasn't because of the one year gap
you might have been in uni
and you are struggling you will never know
I feel like you
you are successful you you just don't know that
you don't know I mean now you have so much experience
and uni look at that you know
I mean like they really look at experience you know what have you been doing since you graduated they focus on that
ya that's true and I heard that is a good school
they didn't get accepted in uni but they work then after that they apply again and they get
they got in because of the work experience so I feel like you have higher chances of
getting
intake
but inshallah
I mean like you can I can lah I have known you for seven years you're so hardworking
I mean uni hard is going to be hard I mean you need hard like uni life is gonna be hard
but ya lah you can manage your time well
so
I feel like you can lah
and is good because you are taking full time right
answer me
what what what which course are you planning to get
I mean you just mainly just look at your major what minor you can choose later cause major okay what marketing is it what
what which part
ya
I think minor minor in business or what
minor is just
literally the word minor is minor
the major one is a major
you get what I mean
ya so
but marketing is
on demand nowadays
right
and
healthcare also
I mean like you can market
but under healthcare what
why not
oh ya I forgot
doctor times
okay
ya but I have heard about it
eh I'm but I'm planning to
I'm planning to
going under healthcare also
like under social work
now after this feel cause I'm tired of teaching
just tired of
watching kids suffering
so maybe I will get back to it later
you know you know I'll just explore and
this is the thing I heard you know I don't like when people generalise
us
as job hoppers
ya I mean like it's hard to change one's mind also we can only change our minds
so they are going to continue looking us as job hoppers
but
to me
like you know you just going to be stuck
you know mundane for the rest of your life
I'm
but
it's just
it's just not how our generation works nowadays you know we need to find what we love to actually
ya that's why passion is important to me
how is it possible
is it a typo or what
but
okay lah I mean there are so many expectations of us
I'm not
try to
I mean there is
people our age
but
you know some people are the weaknesses some people have the different strengths
and
I mean don't
borderline you know that kind of thing
so I really hope that one day we will find the jobs
we were really passionate about lah
okay like they get into jobs they like right they work they have progression and all that
in singapore
because all those movies are
always based on other other countries you know
I don't know like
okay like
overseas you know working overseas will we be success more successful like oh
you know as compared to in singapore
you get what I mean
ah okay okay this now is a fun topic okay I don't know where but I like ah rom com
you know romantic comedy
those kind and I like thrills also thrills movies
ya so anything that keeps my adrenaline you know rush because I'm an adrenaline junkie
how are you
so what type like
like usually you Netflix

wow I barely have time for that
do you watch modern family
oh my god you should watch you should watch it's funny
oh is it good
it's funny
it's it's cute
okay okay
is it okay I didn't know that I mean like I always
oh I mean I I've seen
everyone like posting about stranger things
but like okay lah I I might watch it one day but you should watch modern family
it's hilarious
hilarious
okay but if you watch modern family with someone
it's funnier
then watching alone probably like uh
okay lah funny but eh quite boring
not boring
but like it's
nicer with someone
exactly and I'm single as hell
oh that's so sweet
I mean I wanna watch but I don't wanna get stuck
on on it you know
like people play like among us
but like I don't
I really want to try but I don't want to get stuck on it
is it a hype or is it just for a while
I see okay
that make sense
but I can see you is the type of person who can control you know you have
quite
I can't like I don't have self control
know things that
you know are healthy
and
ya I don't mind spending
over
time on it
alright oh my god it sounds like a plan
okay
it's been long since I start playing you know
games
and ya lah I mean like
we are twenty two what do you
expect
we rarely oh my god did you overcook
it's because it's so hard
is it okay which one the the older one or
eh the younger one
eh wait wait wait wait
the
the youngest
oh are you serious
you don't play with the second one
I see boring
but
ya lah I
I mean I love four
but overcook is fun
that's true that's true
I mean but
ya lah I mean
I'm trying my best to not spend
not spend on stuff that are unnecessary I mean like
there's a lot of things I wanna do I wanna shop you know I wanna shop for facial stuff makeup
because
I feel like overspending I won't be able to save
in the future
do you invest in anything
on so every month
I see but how much does he save per month
you will get
more
than what you save
hundred K
I mean it's quite
reassuring lah to know that
ya so I feel like you should you should invest on

like
all these investment and all that kind of stuff
it's really productive okay

because when you do like that kind of like hand
hand gun one right I'm sure it's gonna hurt a lot more than when you use a gun
I mean as compared to a
machine gun like a machine electronic machine
I'm sure it's not that fast lah
ya
I almost got a tattoo there
no I was planning it
and then after that just when we were there he
so and then
so I was like fuck it ah like
and when you come back we talk about it

ya
ya
no lah she know lah uh
I I stayed over at her friend's house of course she know
no
it's just
me
like I
ya I mean
one time I literally passed out
on the living room
yeah
I don't know ah
I I know at one point she she she didn't
yeah
ya never again though
yes
throwing up
no
yeah
ya
ya I did it was like one of the first few conversations we had
cause she asked about halal haram ratio
then I said oh ya I I I used to drink a lot and stuff
ya
cause she said
ya uh I stopped already so okay lah that doesn't bother her
that kind of thing like that
ah
what
ya then happened like three
in the same night
and then after that
no I don't I don't remember
ya
that as
ya and then one time
then after that
then after that you know like they dance very close one
then my friends were behind me then they were like egging me on
that one I remember
I I was so angry at myself sia
ya
I mean I feel kind of bad but
also kind of
good
ya
how is it how was your last duty you get into trouble or not
surprising
uh huh
mmhmm
ah
ah okay
action sia
I
oh
ah
hand over shift
reservist
actually not really lah I used to stick around a lot also
ya
okay I'll
mm
mm
night shift I wasn't like that ah because yours is twenty four hour shift so you always finish in the morning kan
for me if I night shift then I finished in the morning kan
ya
last time my rota quite bonded ah
ah that's like fucking eight bicycle sia
mm
oh ya how was it cardiac arrest right
ah
cannot sia
mm
dah expect ah
mm
fuck
ya that's quite rare
I think for the most part my my cardiac arrest
think like only like
ah
mm depends ah depends on how far the hospital is depends how fast we reach
ya
oh
like
when when was the last time they saw him
when was the last time he was seen like healthy
like when was that
oh
why sia
ya ya ya
all medics
my time it was like optional
they expect you to go
mm
ah
that's cool
the this captain from
err division yishun
so he cover my station sometimes when the paramedics on leave or what
so ya
oh ya my last
you know my err last duty
eh no three shocks then the pulse came back
yeah
ya
that one also quite surprising so
then they but the I think it's because
ya it's like
pretty much lah but most of the time we still try ah just to
at least
put in effort
ya
but usually it's very rare ah unless like the patient collapse in front of
like
like patient collapse then they straight away call
and start doing lah
to do that kind
ya
then he was like like
you fucking terrible at until like an has to take over you
and like the that take over wasn't even me it was like I had to ask my junior to do cause I to set up the other equipment
ya so I asked my junior about the physical
why okay what actually last time medic
cause if you do C
everybody wants to do
cause you do is like brainless you just equal the rhythm you keep up the right pressure okay already
ah
ya
err they started right after I
as in
ya that's true
like like there's there's stretcher they put inside is so they can convey those kind of patients also
ya
ya
so I think like the
orh firefighter

ah ah ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya that's what I saw also ah when I turn out with them

orh so even then like if even if you turn out the will take charge lah
ah so so if anything like the will take charge of the call lah
what
ah ya
oh then
ah I see I see
ya
orh they want to put people into the
ah
eh but actually now also turn out for
also turn out for cardiac arrest right
ya got some some new thing called
high high intensity or something like that
I don't know what the hell it is ah high intensity
ya let me google ah high intensity
high performance high performance
so it's like a
it's like a new protocol

like procedure like
like a flow to it
to make it more like

what the fuck
workload and the
uh huh

ah like I never
last time I remember they they ask us to download when I was in then they say like it's not compulsory but we highly encourage you to download

no idea
it's M something is on the halal eater page lah
no it's at uh it's at a building is like I would say like like a office building
explore right and try halal options in singapore
yes
err he he we shared the food
ya so that was our dinner our short and sweet dinner
we we did we did we went to west coast park
the mcdonald's there the mac cafe there ya so the the mac the west I think the mac cafe the mcdonald's is twenty four hours
ya
ya how mm
ya yes he did
what about you eh what did you do yesterday night
oh it's like among the cheapest lah in at among parking lots parking spaces
that's quite good eh quite cheap
oh
the the lor mai kai is damn nice eh very nice ya
you missed the chance
what noodles did you uh did you wanted to try
ban mian okay
it feels good ah
ya
unusual superpower
err
hmm I think one of the most obvious ones would be the ability to grow money to grow money because I think err if I have all the money in the world I can actually help lots of people ya deep eh
it is nice ya
teleport
err actually I I I said that because like err my I was watching this like interview of my favourite celebrity korean celebrity and she said that so I want to emulate it's hyorin lor hyorin the sistar one
so and I think is a very good err superpower superpower cause I think right now um you know with money we can actually do lots of stuff
answer politically right answer
I actually saw this err one movie recently on netflix right is called I boy
ya so it's it's inspiring lah I would say inspiring movie I boy the movie title is I boy but he is a high school student high school err high school is it middle school I can't remember okay middle school
like to turn to lah in a sense ya
ya
society society is like what your school your teachers
labels
I think err I think it's is somewhat true lah because I think it is somewhat true because like uh if you were talking about right there's um the number of malay the malay population in is very little ya and some more we are already the minority like err there's not a lot of us err compared to the chinese the chinese people back in school so it's much much lesser
he's always on the ship ya travelling I don't know where but I think err that kind of job is is quite it piece very well especially if you start from young and I don't think he um he is he intends to go uni ah because from what I see his career is pretty much set in place ya so
it will be a very rewarding experience
education ah
ya so I feel like if everyone has equal opportunity uh to have to access err to access uh all these various uh resources I think it will be nice lah for everyone ya not saying that err the elite schools are better than the neighbourhood schools lah I'm not saying that I'm just saying that it will it will be nice if
have a deep interest in school ya because we provide them with all the resources basically resources that they can do lah
mm
ya
in their head ya
equality versus
equality ah
ya I get I get I know ya ya
equity
ya so like if you need more then they give you more if you need less they give you less
everyone has the same amount ya but you are different starting points
oh if it is if it's something in that you could wish is free what would it be
time
err
so you want the world to freeze the time
vampire
vampire werewolf okay okay if you if you err if you if you get to choose right will you be vampire or werewolf
um
okay actually I want to be vampire also you know why cause less hair
she is one in like ten
of course you can you can change him from a human to a werewolf
society

so what netflix shows are you currently watching now
oh have you watched orphan black
it's actually a canadian dramatic conspiracy thriller and science fiction lah television series that have like around five seasons the show is actually about a set of clones I think there's more than eight
there's sarah who is a pair of twin she's british in the show
uh the other twin his ukrainian
um she grew up in a church and seems like she's a nutcase and she's raised she raised uh she was raised by the nuns and she was trained by this group they call themselves prolethean who was again science
so the series stars this actress uh tatiana maslany
as sarah
a woman who steals the identity of these like suicide victim
um uh who is one of the clones lah
then she always uh live like an outsider and she
she was like an orphan
ya so that's pretty much it I mean they show isn't perfect the plot lines are sometimes ludicrous and season three was pretty underwhelming uh compared to season two and season four
mm I don't feel so emotionally attached to a show in years but this concept about one person playing all the clones uh usually could be quite can be a quite disastrous right but this one they have really good writers because and also I think mainly because they have this tatiana this actress right they made the show ten times better than what it should have been so because of her it became like this really masterful performance and then she also won emmy last last year so hopefully because of this shows you we can rise up the back of this lah
and beyond that the supporting characters also not bad so there's art donnie felix missus S scott ferdinand what I can remember lah because this is the current show I'm watching now
um
it's really good and then that there's there's always action in every episode but the thing is this style isn't for everyone but I love it lah so you won't get err you won't be bored with all the twists and turns and then the scene right between sarah and this clone I will not spoil lah because there's a lot of clones in the show in the final episode right is one of my favourite scene in the show so it's quite emotional or can make you cry and I like the way it ended uh without spoiling it for you
err I think
the tone is what it is but it's something you get used to especially as they dig into the characters more
which is where the show really shines I will give it a few more episodes uh actually episode six in season one right is over the top but it's also where a lot of people fell in love with the show if it does nothing for you right it's uh probably safe to check out ah because if you don't like the first three episode I don't think you are going to like the show because five season is really long for someone to get invested so you can choose to check it out
oh okay okay ya I'll keep a lookout lah
I think you can start to read up on top ten questions and answers in an interview and start to rehearse uh them usually they will start with tell me about yourself question
you should start to like uh draft two hundred words to describe your experience so when the time comes it will be natural for you
I think you can google but I can help you lah I can send you the link later you should also start to set aside your uh interview outfit
um don't need tie ah I guess err maybe just a formal wear including uh smart shoes formal shoes
okay
ya be positive uh and also be open lah
a'ah
mm
okay
oh I was watching wentworth
it's about it's a women's prison show yes but it's ah creepier and more real it's um it's not is not a comedy like orange orange kan orange is more to comedy drama this one is quite violent ah ya no it's aussie
nine I know
yes got alot of show I'm waiting for uh uh why you like
oh um I mean for me err I'm waiting for money heist uh wentworth ozark dead to me kingdom so those are coming up with new seasons ah
ya ah ya you know right they going to do a korean remake on money heist
ya uh my friends are all waiting for it because they all enjoy korean show uh I don't really like remakes though
you watch korean shows
okay so you like money heist is it your favourite
why
oh ya
mm
ya ya
oh so you think you like a professional critic ah
ya ya ya I think it would be more stupid and unrealistic if let's say there's there were no idiotic actions I think a whole lot of the idiot idiot decisions you are talking about uh about the the gang right and the professor being overconfident uh raquel losing her shit because of a crush on the profeesor and so on but I think you just make it more real lah if not if not it's like a show that nothing goes wrong I don't like the second season uh but it was very entertaining to me ah also quite compelling and way better in spanish um ya
so but breaking bad is also a show where who brisk and also the overconfidence drive much of what the characters do except
uh uh the other character is a perfect hero and what he does for most of the story like walter white makes no mistake and then horribly effect or matter to him so damaging to everyone else at what he does I enjoy the professor in this uh money heist because he seems like a brilliant dude who makes no mistakes but some of it are impulsive decision and when various things went wrong sometimes really really wrong because of his actions
ya so I guess we can have different opinions ah but it's not bad but maybe you are right it's a bit too overrated lah anyway so today is twelve twelve uh sale so are you buying anything
I think for the next forty five minutes still have but I think it's going to extend until the next full uh a couple of days normally it's like that
usually
mm I think maybe you can try shopee first and then after that you can take a look at uh ASOS or maybe sports they got a lot of uh sneakers on sale
mm
I am looking for air fryer
uh
no I'm busy mm I'd or not I don't as of now I don't have any plans to buy her anything quite busy finding ah strider balance bike for azam
second
uh carousell so I found one uh uh that can deal at buangkok but uh he didn't reply so I'm still searching for it
oh okay lah why not it's a balanced bike not a bicycle so should be okay lah firsthand is hundred eighty because of the brand uh second hand if in luck we can get fifty dollars
you know
ya I need to get properly the other time when I check they sell forty dollars but uh the tire had cannot see the thread and then it's rusty so I need to check properly lah
it depends on his father's uh interests and free time
ya so have you thought about azri's suggestion about you continuing studies to get a degree
uh if you ask me I think so because diploma is pretty much nothing now it's more important to get a degree so I think if you land a job in uh government sector uniform group like uh prison service uh um I think there will be scholarship that you can apply to study part time degree
ya they're quite supportive eh but you need to read more lah you need to do more research uh but there's bond lah I think err since I think they going to pay for your study so confirm got bond
but then
you mean like this uh uniform group then you should uh still think of enrolling yourself for a part time degree by yourself ah that means you should set up save up because I think this is a good investment for yourself
uh I think you will thank yourself in future
ya okay
ya mm
doesn't
do you know a lot of people who has a degree
oh so like you you mentioned just now so they they basically
uh their degree are sponsored by the company ah ya I mean like for example um
mm
so rolls royce pay for his degree
oh that's good so uh as he get as he ah got the degree right so did his salary also uh goes up went up
oh okay that's good can I ask what is his position
oh okay five years eh mm so how come you don't asked to apply there to get his uh recommendation do you don't you want to work there
oh okay okay

just ah iskandar I think they if you see like ah anything that is pertaining to family ya or the family like she won't really like
say out you know I think ya I think and that's that
ya
thing
ya
ya
actually that's come a long way man she is the first nisa I know
that hung out at like ah sarah porch and like we all hang out five of us or four of us
ya she she's come a long way man she just got pissed drunk nisa

aiyo that girl
know that day like err the staycation lah with me ah it's my birthday ah
I I I just lay down on her lap and I just started bawling
like bawling
my emotions I'm like ya I I
no babe it's not just her I think if any of us is like no longer a part of the group or even if let's say some shit happens some drama happen and one person just decide to okay
you know evaporated that's we will feel one babe
which I doubt to to be honest I don't think that will happen lah I mean
ya kan
they even even
ya
ya
at that point of time I was I I understood I understood why sarah
got pissed off about what happened you know what happened right sort of
ish
ya
tini
no to tini to tini so
no so it's not that um
on that day
and I was like fuck like
this is not
at the same time yes
correct so so so
like he said a different thing so I couldn't and I just babe okay I can't take it anymore I told tini
pizza
so sarah
no she and I and I told tini tini
um this tini and then sarah went ballistic already ah cause you know she she on her side she knew what happened already also somehow I can't remember
no no she don't know no
no tini didn't want to talk what
it was very awkward
that's the thing I don't know I think when we came down I don't know maybe cause oh maybe cause in the taxi I told her babe actually right no one wants you there I say like it's it's really not a good time cause we want to hang out five of us
um and I told her like I feel like this is something that we should talk about so sarah made it clear that she felt like it wasn't in my place to ah she she said that
err bash thing
I I I don't think I have a single bone in me to do that to a friend and I'm not like that I am not rattle rattle no it's just at that point of time this was but I understand where you're coming from it could have been in better circumstances maybe you could ah tell it to us first before you know but at that point of time
I cannot force them to mould them and change how they think about me right correct correct so from like
talk about the the our depths of you know what we feel with with
that she both are being played so jas is just a fucking asshole just it
yes and even sarah ya ya correct
ya you you actually have a group of people who genuinely cares for you who will tell you as it is who will not
nisa did nisa did

hurt
ya
ya right ya
so ya lah
then that that was what happened so hope that ya that that exactly we don't I don't come to you and like only only now one year later then we like you know
but ya so that that thing with sarah I felt that there was a little bit of a shift
I cannot just force someone to like trust or ya ya no she trusts me she trusts me is just in terms of
ya which I I which I respect really I I cannot force her to
ya
ya actually normal
ya that's true
ya
of course
ya
ya

okay
okay
okay okay
mm okay lah angry lah
okay
mm okay oh okay okay
ya okay
okay

okay
okay
ya okay
yes yes and traffic jam you don't know whether

a bit greasy ah
oh most of your friend also do at fort canning ah

okay
but that will be strange
mm
peranakan day ah so I think ya I have to go there early
mm
okay so that part
ya I have to ask dewi to do research lah then from there
ya lah and another thing I was thinking whether should do photography after the wedding or that day
then the makeup will have to tip top after the wedding mah
okay
okay I was thinking the peranakan house the terrace house over there and then east coast
mm
okay another thing I thought of so is inside the wedding the the hotel itself but must inform them right
cause err lynn told me don't know must sign agreement I don't know if you remember okay
okay now I cannot decide where to take photo because I haven't gone to the venue
mm okay
ya
whether to see okay
mm we can go up and see ah

okay

um but it's during the err the you you guys got the how is it how I can't remember the walk in ah how you guys did the walk
is straight away just sit on the okay
then after that all the way there and then
oh then after that then eat lunch then go back and sit again ah
then everything finished at twelve thirty
eh wait ah
I remember is a eleven to three ah ya
okay
ah I think it's four hours total ya ya
okay ya there will be there will be delay yes definitely
err
that is the main main core concept
oh I cannot say like I have to have at least sixty percent I must know what's happening
okay
she don't care
yes
ah that's the thing I need to go down and see the venue how it looks like whether ya
they will delay
then one thirty
lunch time
so one thirty to about err one thirty two thirty three thirty ya about one thirty to three thirty ah then whole lunch ah then in between before the one thirty starts right err we have the walk in lah then from the walking then that means about one forty five blah blah blah some some
some plans lah some activity lah so for about ya
katong and they mentioned the same thing twenty
close family can mingle
ah
okay
hopefully lah okay
so I thought of what you know get some emcee or what ah ya

your players are like a main of the game eh without the players what do you have like an empty online page
mm
ya I mean it's not as if they are not making money you know they are making a lot
ya
and that's what has been happening what like the
so I guess that's why to them it's like no matter what they do we will still buy
kan
habbo
habbo is the main reason why yes
ya
but like kind of weird though like a game is so big that lah
ya
ya that's why that's why I don't understand why is it so big I mean like doesn't make sense at all like smite is so big
it's probably him ya
I don't know sia
ya and he spent so much on that game also what I mean we all have
I guess
I heard they they were doing a spongebob
ya I heard I don't know someone said spongebob then I was like I don't know
oh ya that one I heard also but I heard I heard spongebob I want sia
I don't know
cute sia
oo is there a snail god
I don't know maybe
who could be that
kumbhakarna
yes
mmhmm
mm
oo
and another person orh
hmm that's hard good looks or fit body
mm
then yourself leh
mm
yes
ya
true
true
mm
I mean also like after a certain point in your life like you can't really keep up
good looks
ya
hmm
no any other day hmm
and
ya
oh ya not not bald lah no lah like as in like short
I don't know I
mmhmm
ya
I just haven't had the
the like courage to go shave my head again
I don't know like
but ya
ah
um
mm ya mostly netflix if like watch so many shows over the past
like tag along so like
huh really I didn't know
oh you didn't say
did you say oh I didn't see
I didn't
oh no he means he can't even play at all ya
I I don't play with my macbook I play on my
ya
mm
just one mm
probably a house with like a farm attached
you said one thing but I didn't
ya so you like
mm
with its with its own private jet
no but like a house would be fine I mean it's one item
kan
ya I mean a house will be nice like
at least that's settled especially in singapore
you don't need to work anymore I mean like you can work like small little jobs
I know right
ya basically that
so but ya that's it
what what should be free
oh
I guess
I guess
mmhmm
ya
but like I guess that's how the
the world has come to ah like everyone all the governments own everything and then you have to pay them
unless you move to like some
like island
yishun
build their own houses that kind maybe
but ya
ya
by there's an island
I didn't know
cow
you mean there's this one like random
what on earth
coney island
ya ya I've heard of it I have never been there though
ya let's go look for that cow later
is there
interesting we go find out lah
kan
it's an island so that means the cow wandered in on its own
I mean
but it's such a weird thing to to happen in singapore
I don't know what is the lifespan of a cow
oh
I mean the
I mean there's still one that exists that like
she owns the place basically and then like uh
they rented the house that we were filming in from her
like give a bad name to the place and stuff
cause like previously something happened lah when they they tried to like film like a horror thing there and like something happened
ya I think I was telling
mm ya it is the thing that confuse me cause the auntie told us like oh I see you guys are nice people so it should be fine
like it won't harm you unless you do anything to it
and like we film from
yes
like really late and then ah they wanted to start filming at like eight
model or something
so she's quite tall lah and then like um
her features were like pretty lah like
like a model person's features
mm that part that was the one lah
ya
mm ya we cut the the wig
then like ya at first it was like kind kind of worrying lah cause she kept complaining like
or like uncomfortable and this that
so like
like wandering around and shit
ya
I think the the the people who stay there are quite like welcoming
they they were just wandering the place like
seeing
then we just like like we told them lah like oh we're filming a horror movie here
but it's quite interesting place ah cause it's surrounded by
that hut that looks like a kopitiam
but it's exist now ya
the trees are quite tall
then like only behind the trees then you see the so it's quite quite cool
ya
it's quite big ya
the houses are all like one floor lah
so like ya
like no electricity and stuff
but then they I think they added in electricity so like some houses have electricity now
quite cool
oh visit huh there's mosquitoes though
that's like the one thing I just didn't like about the place like especially at night
cause we were filming until like what seven
the there's a road that goes through the entire place lah so like along the road it's quite bright but like in the houses itself it's quite dark unless you are in the one with people lah
and but we only hear like
so we only saw the surrounding by when we were in the lorry
ya
no cause like I mean kind of like paiseh ah cause we didn't like come there to explore and then they only call me down to do the stuff
so like
and then um
the auntie was very nice so she's the one who came down and talk to us
like she kept coming by and like saying like oh wah so cool and stuff so it was quite quite cute
ya
she just goes around does that every time
ah but ya
it is a
ya
even though like you're right in the centre of everything else
but like it's quite nice ah it's quite cold that night
cause of all the trees and stuff
um
yes guardian angels
ya the auntie lives alone now quite
yes her guardians
but ya quite interesting ah the place
interesting
um
I honestly don't know ah I
what else to do in singapore
what what else can we explore
where
go at night lah
ya I think same ah if like I had to like
true
but
oh ya I'm not awake
ya to wake up at seven and like seven to eight just to go hiking is
is something else
mm
mmhmm
really
that's interesting
uh the zoo
is the zoo even open
open right
they wear face shields
cause we need to see them smile
cause not they will think that they are trapped
and sad
yes
yes sia is it even open I think it is already lah if not how how they make money
they need the money to keep the animals there
they shouldn't move
make them like let it be free
like the lions and elephants roam singapore
can you imagine
pulau semakau that's the bloody landfill right
put the cow there
I haven't been to the zoo in years
three years quite recent lah ya
I mean honestly nothing much has changed so I don't know really know why how you want to keep going back to see animals in cages
ya
cat
orh orh
catty
catty enclosure
mm
and jumping on things
mm
like the other time I went I saw the polar bear
that one was depressing as hell like the polar bear's fur was like just it just looks depressed lah like the whole ya the bear was skinny as hell
and then like I mean their they are like naturally born for like
cold climate and stuff and singapore is nothing but that I guess it's really horrible lah to put polar bear in there
he died
he died
you
ya didn't look like old age sia the the bear just look like it was dying for years already
it was so skinny
I don't know apparently it was born in singapore
so they say like
ya I just feel like it's from yishun
yishun has cold weather and move it
just wandering around it's blue cage
like
I feel like a polar bear need ice
singapore is so hot
poly ya secondary school the last time I went
ya
it was not meh
it was
it was lah cause I don't remember wearing for things in poly
no it was in secondary school I swear I think I don't think it was in poly
cause it was very long ago
gardens
by the
I opening
uh five to two
and it was opened in twenty twelve
how many years ago eight years ago
ya sia
sec four lah so probably in sec four cause I don't remember going in poly
like I always go way before poly so like
end of sec four
ya
no
no it was open
they said they open in twenty twelve
twenty nine june
fifty million
visitors as of twenty eighteen
you thought one day
orh
it's quite pretty lah the the indoor garden is nice
I like
plants
that I don't mind
ya
thirty
ya all our thirty dollars
cause of gardens by the bay and changi airport
hmm
that's a hard question
but legit lah like
basically the first thing I would ask
for is a house like
a dream house
like not not in singapore somewhere cold
right ya
oo
true
not worry about anything
and then they just make you like someone who doesn't care about anything anymore
that's what genies can do
so if your wish is from a genie then ya
genie in the bottle
hmm
I would wish to be
legit
no that's such a tiring job oh my god
I would wish to be richer than jeff bezos
so I can own him
and then I take all his money and give everyone else
but ya I just would wish for like unimaginable amount of money I think that would solve a lot of problems
mmhmm
the money won't exist
okay like that like that imaginable amount of money
like a whole filled with cash that amount
and like by cash is like hundred dollars bills not by twenty cents
then like ya that amount of money
and use it to
or maybe find the cure to every disease in the world
and then use it to make money
that's what everyone does
mm
yes
can you imagine having like the the power to
solve every disease out there
ya some some random white guy gonna make billions out of that
should do it
but what was your third wish
what was your third wish
oh ya
just be like unbothered
yes
ya
mm
ya previous
mm money is like half of our issues
true
can you imagine if you had like three wishes and then first wish was to wish for five hundred more of you
what with five hundred clones
I don't know then everyone of you got like three more wishes
that would be cool
I guess
someone getting their wishes
don't know
mmhmm
mm
so what the hell
wow
plot twist
genies
ya
but like would you waste your wish on that
oh
mm
fair
why
ya
yes
right
COVID has been putting so many things on hold
how life has changed in like what less than a year
it's so weird
all like
in december last year we were all like
being crazy and having fun and like
not even thinking and then suddenly in february
right
being in school like right now
not on zoom classes
ya ya sure
ya but life would be so different without having to scan your
your code
everywhere you go
and
I guess ya
true true
just hide your identity all the time
ya I love it
ya
and that's nice
but like the safe entry thing is kind of annoying
so what's the difference of like using that compared to your right it's literally does nothing different
mm
or like if it actually has like any actual benefits like
I don't know like they actually know exactly where we are that kind of thing
so like whoever you actually come in contact with that has COVID then they can track
but like from what I've heard there's no in it ah so like
probably not
mmhmm
and they haven't really spoken much about it like
on the on the news and stuff like it's just very hush like you just come and collect that's it
I didn't even know
mm
mm
no one was interested
ya
mmhmm
ya they
into this kind of stuff ya
I mean okay lah to be fair like the older generations some of them don't have smartphones
so like for them to access like
shopping malls and stuff will be hard
but like they have their and that's something I know like old people won't lose
so like
ya
mmhmm
you know it's like you can't drop it you can't
get it like near water
like I'm pretty sure someone's gonna drop it
yes
drop it like right after you get it
like in front of the person like oops
I mean if it had if had like data in it like would you mind
why
monitored
mm
mm
mm
true
mm
but I mean if it's in the government then like
kinda messed up if the government is using it to
make fund like
criminal stuff
mm
I guess
I miss cats
ya
cat cafe
orh
same
I just I cannot imagine like
oh
I was like huh
ya
oh that's weird
the hell
mm
mm
have your seen your cat
that cat
I also haven't see
when I go down
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
your cat is wild
yes
that cat deserves to be in a zoo
have its own like
safari at like enclosure
true
does your aunt is your aunt scared of cats
orh
mm
ya
fur gets everywhere though
allergies
how
that's weird
mm
and then ya I would like cough and then have trouble breathing
that's when it gets bad lah like he I really cannot breathe like I will start coughing
and stuff
but I don't know what is the reason for it I think it's
ya
bathe them right ya but like
stinks ya
he hates it lah but like it's fine uh it's fine lah he just hates it he doesn't like
aggressive
oh really
orh
I mean get scared lah like you can his face he doesn't want to be there
he has that like let me go face but then
like I think he's fine lah like cause I I usually carry him while I bathe him
like he's in my hands
what
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
but like
you mean like what like people like make the virus or
this happens
mm
mmhmm
I guess but
I don't know like why is it more common now than like back then or like I mean like to me it's been every every few years confirm got like some
global pandemic what then like
every year we just come out with like better medicine and stuff
to like combat it so like
I don't think it would wipe out the human race like but I mean people will die lah confirm but like
oh
mm
faster
that makes sense
into climate change
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
I think there comes a point where you have to like stop
cause like
how advance do we need to be
stop
just leave
seven hundred languages
cause like I feel like everything is fine as it is
like I mean if you want to find like cures and like
mm
is put to use
ya
mm
somewhere else
that needs it
mm
mm
mm
think that's the issue with like most
like everyone
chasing money
money ya I think the next president should just remove money
there is not no money
what the
but do you hear about the the that orchard towers thing
the murder thing the guy got off with a warning
the guy was like in for like murder charge and then he just like
escape with nothing
ya
ah ya
ya
ya
murderers
ya
oh well
ya sia and then the girl got like sponsorship opportunity and stuff
nonsensical sia like how
why
mmhmm
are we
bye bye

alright
now we're good to go
alright oh right
oh

basically a lot of self studying ah
a lot of background
mmhmm
ya

forced hardworking
mm mm
I see I see
ya of course ya ya I mean
once ah ah I mean
I cannot I don't think I can apply to other uni

so I mean I procrastinate lah so it took me like
like I I I know I know the
is it march was it march that they open or was it march that they're closing
ya ya ya okay so march
the second week of march then I'm just like okay I need to do I need to do my stuff
exactly but okay but then they still send me oh okay ah
oh you've been shortlisted so please do our online interview
ya I do the online interview but I screwed up entirely
okay let me tell you okay so basically right there was one weekend where okay we you know that time we're in right
ya so
it was
so
like straightaway on my computer
just watch video or play game and just like mm
don't know what to do ah
okay then once my
then I was like okay lah I need to do something ah the deadline coming close
okay I start I do I do all the needed documents
I print err not print I search for all the
err err what what all the
courses that I whatever paper whatever certifications that I got I
I dig up for it okay then dig dig dig dig

which is one is the course that you're in what is it ah what is it called
okay okay so I applied for the is honours kan
okay okay

one choice a bit too little lah so I choose one more
ya but I only applied for one
like I think
they gave me four options or six option I cannot remember but
I don't know I and ah eh is it I don't know okay okay
so I was like okay err maybe I I put two ah so one was
infocomm security then the second one was

and when ah they ask for my portfolio I was like what
okay okay okay I I have no idea how to put this portfolio

so there this is where I realised
that um the portfolio is specific to what course you apply
okay so the second course that one about err entertainment or something ah
so that I can so that they can use it as a baseline
whether they should ah so
ya that was when I realised ah so
what I did was I
like uh screw it ah I don't want to apply for this course then I delete it from my option
the moment I delete from my option right the portfolio was not needed already then I was like oh okay
ya I only applied for one option lah I only put one choice
second course ah ah infocomm security

ya
uh huh
uh huh
I see
so teamwork
I see
err okay
ya
okay
I
ya ya not yet
I mean okay I see it this way you know like
I see as a I see it as the is it am I too soft or what
blessing in disguise will you say
like you know how he like you say ah is like okay um
revolves around teamwork
team collaboration
team effort
okay so
now
the moment COVID strike
everything is done online on Zoom meetings
whatever forum that they try to
implement within that short period of time to ensure
students still can um collaborate do team effort all that
but I feel like like err this current time this current period is like the the most
err hardest ah I feel
ya
uh huh
something like that
err honestly eh I might
might not lose a lot within this year that I have a gap
I mean I'm still losing money ah that's the main thing ah
uh I mean I guess you can say this recording ah
no lah I mean
honestly speaking I'm trying to look for a job I applied for a job but right now
okay at first I feel like okay at first I thought okay ah maybe I should try to apply something related to what
I want to do in the future
then okay so I look look look see see see for any like opening cause like
most of the people that they're looking for are like oh two three years of
err the experience that you are
relevant ya then I was like what
ya lah ya lah I mean
I can apply but okay you know the
the united
uh traineeship or something like that programme
okay so
okay
august like I was like okay ah
ah maybe I'll get my one more pay in september
you know
you know that that that expectation okay ah so I was like I didn't
I didn't bother to look for any jobs ah during august to september
um early september
like
last month lah
okay okay okay sorry sorry
okay so
I expected september
to get my last pay ah but
then I I I ask me
I ask my lah eh can you help me check
err are we supposed to get paid uh september then he was like ah okay okay I'll get back to you
then after that
ah he he came back and then he said oh no your
how they pay is like
ya you're paid for that
month that you're working
rather than
uh something like that maybe
so
then I was like oh shit
that means like I won't get paid lah on the september
ah
ya
what is that
mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
wow
not bad not bad
Adidas eh
ah okay
oh
eh ah
oh oh oh oh
my bad my bad no I I I I mistaken sorry sorry
sixth october that's
I think about a week from now
ah
cause um
bill from their system
okay
so then uh the the person in charge they like oh err
can you come to the
computer here I I check the reason then I was okay they check they check they check then they the
that lady was like oh err are you still are you still in are you still serving
then I was like oh ah I just finished I just like
last week then she was like uh okay okay then I have to remove you from the eleven B scheme oh man
that was like ninety eight dollars
hais
ya lah
ya lah of course ah I I expected I need to pay but I
was like hoping at that one per cent
but
ya
mm huh
hais
I was like
the the amount of work I have to do
two point four
three is that one is before err ah but six months is a very long
think so I don't know lah
no but the thing is I don't I don't want to do that the job scope anymore
it's just too taxing ah
a'ah
I would extend if I'm doing like admin work ah honestly if they give me admin work for the next six months I'd take it
I would not
eh I would not think twice
I just
ya serious ah
one last talk
oh I see
oh I see
uh huh
a'ah
I see I see
no lah okay so uh
and then
to eh no sorry my
and then basically then go up to ah so there's this
this directing staff is external
okay so there's a
particular set of people that like really
err
err expect a lot from the from us ah
standby area is at seven thirty seven forty five
he they expect us to be there before that
I don't know
a'ah ya
and okay so you know how in
err they say oh okay err the duty sergeant or the duty officer will be the one doing all this err
all these checks right correct
uh huh okay
so we also have the
we also had the schedule lah
okay who's duty on monday duty tuesday duty wednesday so on and so forth
okay so let's say specifically
that day was wednesday
okay and then unfortunately the
directing staff was one of the
err the one that we don't like lah
like he expect us to be there he expect us to check he expect us to do everything
and okay
the the thing about err the duty err is like only one person supposed to be there correct or not
okay so
then
so this directing staff came down he was like oh err what time already I was like huh
what do you mean he's like err why I only see one sergeant why I don't see all the sergeant here then it's like huh
what you expect sia you expect all the sergeant to be down here during the check ah
you get what I mean
ya lah
cause like so
that means those people not on duty need to go down and do check ah rather than preparing for what's to come for the day like ha
ya like as we got okay we got so much limited so very limited resource
and he wants to use all the resources just for one small
so we're like err when when I going it was like ah don't care already ah because
maybe one one more week or two more weeks left with them so I was like I don't care already ah
ya
I mean I I just worry for my
under studies ah
um
okay okay
what you have done lah ha
sometimes like I think sometimes you cannot really like do
like full comparison like okay like between you and him
maybe okay how how were you like when you just came into the unit was there like a proper handover or
oh don't have eh
okay then I guess err
mmhmm
okay lah but okay that
and he still cannot
mmhmm
last week
that one your problem ah
just say that lah
oh
err you feel bad for him ah
okay lah okay lah
your brother ah your brother ah
I guess ya
I have to
let's say okay you you're taking this batch for one month
like then um
within that four weeks there is a few weekend correct
are are you being disturbed on weekends or no
sometimes ah
then for me if I am every week every day
my phone will ring my phone will message got ping one confirm I tell you vibrate or whatever lah
everyday will do and everyday hais that's why I'm getting tired of it
example like err interacting with
well
I have to deal with forty two recruits
oh then err the the recruit asking me if I single also that one ah
is it
serious I got
like uh no lah no no no I got one I got one guy during my right
he he was in a relationship with one other guy pin pin in his
in his uh vocation training

ya
a'ah where is he
waliao eh

ah
no
uni changes people eh

okay so the topics that we will be talking today ah it's um firstly
if you got if you could go back in time or forward to the future in ten years where or when would you go maybe you want to start first
for me ah I like science lah so maybe ten years in the future kan I would want to have
and I would like to live with my my family members
and I would like to have my own lab so that I can do most of my research and ah whatever there is lah so
there will be one and like to
to work on research and another thing also uh ten years time probably um I would like to
uh I would like to be in
in a safe place whereby I can
I can have
can have my own fun time like a playground and I like it to be very secluded like maybe in the woods or something so or in a cave
so that's that's what I will I will I will like to go and
focus on my uh
my computing whatsoever lah
yes
so
alright
so moving on
so maybe uh so moving on maybe we will let's
okay so mm
uh you were in your future house
and then um maybe if there are like a few drama picks that maybe you you can watch
what what genre or what kind of drama or what titles
would you actually like to have in your home
to watch in your free time
and why
mm
mind is stimulated ah
uh more to like action thriller
uh okay for for me uh I really like sci-fi and action so probably all the genres which I will like to watch probably star trek
star wars or black mirror cause I think
when you are in technology and there are several different things that you can encounter there
and it gives you uh in-hand situations about uh about issues that could surface in the future lah uh technology areas or
something to think about
ya and and make you like oh it helps me to
solve problems easily and uh see things in a different perspective so tonight there's this one episode eh
the reason why she was trapped is because um
uh her her boss took a of her and other of her colleagues and the boss actually
the boss actually had to so so only the boss can control the game
and very interesting lah how they plan to uh get rid of the boss cause
but the boss itself he he portray himself as the captain
and then ah sometimes he can ah turn this beam into whatever he want to or torture them in a way so technically the people itself them them self were were were were shocked lah cause their was extorted and they were like stuck there so they had to in the end uh some of them still got to plan how to
how to throw him off so uh he was actually very surprised when they managed to escape from them from him because it was a black hole and uh there was a wormhole so they went they went into that and then they manage to escape lah so it was quite surprising interesting ah how they plan out the activities and how they hack into the current
ya
okay so okay so apart from that eh hmm
if you can become an actor
uh what
hmm if you can become an actor eh and like any actor eh do you prefer uh do you prefer to have like good looks or a fit body
ya what what what will you what will you prefer actually if you can become an actor but then
if you can become if you can ask no if you like can become an actor right what
what would you like to focus more good looks or fit body
ya
no as in like no as in no if you can become an actor usually actors they can focus on
so you are saying like having a healthy lifestyle
keeps you keeps you going
mm
I think I will
medicine is getting medicine and healthcare is ah not getting cheaper these days
so I think uh focus on health and and intervening myself from any diseases ah correct I can you know feel the best of my life for the next few years
I think
so what do you think about that
or how can mental health be
be um how can mental health be um what's that addressed
and how can be um
how can we uh better improve our mental health area general
uh projects or work or something which like humans itself has a limit and they actually
very rigorous very very broad and very
things that has yet to be addressed like maybe like mental health support I think mental health support is very important to see how children can take care of themselves
uh rather than you know focusing on grades and rather for rather than focusing on how to get the best result but most ultimately they find whatever they are interested in and whatever they
can do on their level and if they can't do it the the the schools shouldn't push
well you know I think schools should given ah should give them ample time or and or the flexibility to learn
what do you think
depends on the capacity ah
uh off them from whether you like to learn or you
you enjoy it because if you don't enjoy it I think they won't see like a point of doing it
I think that's a blunder in our education system ah like they make everyone else do everything but it's not really what it's not really suited or
but like the education system is still there I think that that there's a there's a you have to not trick the system we have to improvise the system so that
um
um how many one point two grams of uh phosphorus is needed to make uh I don't know cyanide or something
you can think of how to uh not only educate people but training their mind how to think training their mind how to accept new ideas how to make use make full use of the time to learn new things apart from you know just studying for exam memorise then vomiting everything out I think it's really futile in the end they don't know what they want to do then
okay so uh moving on maybe let's talk about
so technically if you were if you can go back
to the past okay like any year or any time period or wherever ah where would you want to go
and why
ya
and you can just enter whatever year
place period and date you want to go where would you want
why
oh when you were a little child
work studies stress ah
we play
mm
cause our childhood is like it's it's somehow
uh memories in child somehow sticks with you for your life
um shape you and how you are today
ah
probably mm
I I think I would want to go to
ya during the dark ages were a period of time whereby uh in the european universe or the western part of the world
ah there were so many diseases and plague
so
apparently during that time many people died most of the population less doctors about one third or I'm not so sure about the statistic but uh there was a really huge plague and there were a lot of
um ya there were a lot of wars and it was a very bloody time a really bloody time there was there was there was a lot of deaths
during that time and ah people were killed and people were died from um
um unknown
and unprecedented diseases so
if I could go back during that time
and if I could travel the world then I would see that I would find like solution on how to like you know
how to counter the illness or whatsoever but apart from
uh the west side
I think I think during the dark ages also there were there were the golden age of inventions because I think during that time there was a lot of inventions from muslim scholars ya like you know sina ah al jazali
uh mariam
abu sayde or something but very very they just it was it was a golden age of islam lah I think it's very interesting to see
inventing the clock invention of the scalpel
so there were a lot of inventions during that time which actually
which actually benefited
this
generation apart from like medicine
medicine engineering
I think there was a lot of things it was a lot of discoveries and inventions which are untold during the golden age
I think it's even
it's it's very it may it may appear far-fetched during that time but I think
it's very interesting on how they manage to combine it's like
things and how they manage to become a poly math
a lot of other things rather than focusing on one so that you know you can expand our knowledge
yup
ya
is it in my job plus for too long
you ah
so apart from like
mm going back in time
um what do you think would be three wishes that you think you would want
to uh have
for example you come across a lamp then you can rub it and then a genie comes in front of you what what three wishes would you actually like to um to ask him
you like here
it looks like a normal lah you particularly the elderly man take
the third one
ah
uh I think first lah I think I'm really content in life but if I could ask for more I wish like
uh I wish
uh I wish that uh world hunger can be stopped lah cause
and they went in first world country
uh no access to water even to not not even water like they only have access to like polluted water or or like urine from uh camels or
cattle so
it's it's very sad lah so if I can if I can have wishes if I can have one wish I'll choose the first wish if I have three wishes one of them would be I hope ah nobody would go hungry lah in this world
and ah the second wish would be ah
I want to have my
own space shuttle so that I can travel in the cosmos or in the space
so that I can be with a job for life I think that's very safe cause uh we don't have the technology
because even from um the nearest got small century to earth is like four point two light years away and one light year is about three hundred and eighty thousand
eh three hundred and eighty three point eight times the power of
metres kilometres kilometres
so um I think it will be very hard but I think it
working good effort to actually wanting to telephone us
so I think having a space shuttle and discovering life
and helping out um others or venturing into the cosmos studying about stuff analyse black holes it's very interesting
and for third wish uh actually uh I think I
I wish to have my own family one day inshallah
maybe next five ten years or so
really helps me to
uh have a more positive outlook on life where I could learn from my spouse
I think for me learning is very for me lah I really like to learn
not like I want I want know
I'm not even dating but um just hope to you know
um get married one day
okay so mm
so maybe uh cause since we had three wishes that we have we we can would you like to add anything like any wish that comes to your mind so far
I eat right
I think uh I think
is not really essential lah but apparently
uh you want your friend or anything
how can I contribute better to the society
cause when you like have a good attitude in life and
I think
uh if you have your own character you have your own good moral values
you can actually be uh be taught to the world
but um having good character actually
have you succeed in life not that you
were great and good attitude to do something really helps you to
move further in life lah
yup
respect
won't look down on you lah
bad reputation
and apparently we want to be we want to be remembered as someone who's
who's actually who's um
who's who's of good nature
okay
I I will agree with you lah that uh having a good moral virtue is I mean good moral is very important in a person
so maybe you move on to next question
flash
speed ah speed
inshallah
uh huh
I I like to teleport ah
ya
mmhmm
what do you think of like robots doing the work cause technically like what we are using now even phones
I think
mmhmm
you know is is very easily easy lah I mean everything you could wish accidents like
know when to use it
cause I think phone are just available everywhere internet is available everywhere so
then it it seeks like entertainment but I think if you really like put a stop to it where where we feel like oh ah when we have like other other priorities to do like if if we have priorities
to do like um we have uh we have to maybe cook for the family or do laundry um some more if you need help you cannot still adhere to um playing our phone okay there are several things that we have to keep in keep in mind lah that there are other priorities that should be done
cause right now even learning learning is through phone is through media
err is through internet okay most people use google as their teacher
so I think ya it's a very different generation lah
I think phone also like you know serve like as a better communication with with others
but I think we we need to learn like when to use it and how to manage our time
so back to the question what do you think of do you think is something
which you could expect in the future
human touch
I think uh uh this thing
trait between and humans probably uh they don't have the emotional attribute
they don't have um
I think reduce human labour or give companions companionship cause nowadays you can see that some
uh some uh some pioneers or some older people they they they they feel lonely so maybe having an to talk to would be like
uh for example labour like being a waitress I think it's okay but at the same time
humans they'll be stuck of like where to learn where to
how to learn and how to do a job even a menial job like
let's hope things could do things work out well and they don't use to like weaponise or do something lah something bad cause technically we want something good out of it
need deep thoughts deep thinking
deep thinking
um especially with the global climate
imagine if you will be using a lot of electricity
to power things where where are we gonna get these sustainable options
and humans I don't think we're gonna live for very long maybe left one thousand years like what to
probably will be um probably will be diminish or whatsoever but I think
uh like what I said can serve a good purpose or a bad one
it depends on how we look at it lah
but not
like from like some the like there are some movies or dramas like
I find it very like perplexing but still very interesting ah to actually think about like imagine imagine will be teachers it'll be very scary because
I don't think
the I don't think students will actually
I don't think they're able to learn as much as how they actually learn from um human beings and like imagine they become teachers they will learn how to punish teach and they don't know how to engage the students it'll be very difficult
even if has an appearance of a human being nowadays there are so many so many um so many notions so many ideas that can be used as like companion dolls
like for I think it's very
very interesting
uh huh

okay hi hamza how was your day today
mmhmm why was it slow
mm okay what okay lah I mean what you do in the morning tell me uh
mmhmm

okay orh
ya for me today was okay ah
today today was my off day
of err leave to clear and like it's been taking me forever to try and clear my
ya my leave lah then
err I've been trying to clear so
then like um
today we had some random meeting
about err strength training like err for media analyst and
the whole melt waters melt water um
like the whole company lah from asia pacific to australia to
what's that to shanghai and what not
ya and like the forgot which teams lah but
ya it was practically like a
workshop where they told us
they like share with us what our
strengths are because we had to take like this test lah before
going for this
workshop ya so like I found out that some of my
strengths was quite reflective
mm it's like a strengths test like a aptitude test like that
ya what are my strength
a bit
ya
ya a bit skewed err ya a bit skewed ah the questions but it's it's just basically to see your strengths
ya
it's like strength
strength analysis workshop something like that
then we had to break up in groups and all that then after that right after we broke up in groups
err
the first time we broke up into groups I was put together with the my boss's boss
like this guy called luke or something I forgot his name
ya I was inside luckily I had one of my colleagues inside there so it was my colleague and then another person from the shanghai branch and then ya we just shared lah then
I went first in that group and when I went first
I took like I think around three minutes lah let's say
then we all spoke right but then the break up room was about to stop already then we only left with one more guy which that which was that boss guy lah the luke guy my boss's boss ya
so like he's like oh err there's not much time left but my strengths is this this this
then he like he he he talk talk talk so he got cut halfway it was quite funny ya
because like ya so they will say like ten nine eight seven six five four there's a countdown lah to tell them to tell us that the break room is err going to be closed
ya so it was quite funny then they had another second break up but my computer kind of um shut down on the zoom orh
eh not shut not my computer shut down like
my computer like the zoom didn't respond
I think because of the change in the break up like from the break up rooms to the zoom meeting
so ya I had to close my zoom and then reopen again
ya nothing wrong with my computer don't worry ya so it was it was okay lah not bad
then after that the second one I found out that some of my teammates just halfway they just left damn rude right
good to know lah when you put in effort to you know
to make it happen ya
ya
then how was your last week
oh that sucks
mm do you think you should have studied or started earlier
sure bo
sure bo
ah
huh
can like that meh
ya
then why you take
ah okay okay understand understand
ya seh
but ya uh
actually my last week was quite interesting ah
not interesting
but
err because remember I had one colleague jaden
no not jaden smith just jaden err he joined the new shift lah
ya my three shift correct
so it like his first day was just me and him
oh no that day he that day
me and jaden
left by like we were sent we were like left to our own devices by our senior because that senior had to do err
what was that err had to go to the dentist for a
wisdom tooth surgery
it was quite horrible because he said he told us in the he told me the night before texted me eh just tomorrow
err tomorrow what's that ah oh tomorrow
I may not be able to oh no tomorrow I might need to leave earlier
and he was ah mind you he was like the guy in charge that day there was only three of us eh on shift when supposedly it was supposed to be five people on shift
ya ya so I I was co in charge lah on that day
no it's not a big deal lah that job it's just
someone to be um
someone to be who's who will answer to the client lah
ya so like
he told me at the night before like at nine o'clock mind you and shift was going to start at three he's like eh just I think err
I may need to leave tomorrow morning after six
ya so we have this deliverable that we have to send at six
ya so after that he said he might need to go I was like okay lah why then he said oh because I have this teeth
problem like I have been having toothaches for the past few weeks and then tomorrow was the like the next day was the only day that he could get
appointment
as soon as possible
because that night I think it was hurting very bad lah
no no no like probably at eight o'clock probably
I don't know lah I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt lah
obviously like
you could be lying also but why would you lie about that you know what I mean
especially on a day where there's two people
ya is it doesn't make sense
err okay I need to leave then he said he told our boss also our project manager then okay lah I told him okay lah then go ahead lah you I will handle even though it's jaden's first day ah then that was jaden's first day also
so I had to train him
I had to retrain him because he's he's been
on or like our other client
um
wah damn long
like for six months
so he has been out of the loop for very long
he's not lah but like
he's practically new because
the last time he was on this shift
was months ago
like
almost I'd say a year ago
to be safe ya
um we are now separated into clients ya
oh cannot say
yes
anyway
stop
ya you don't need to know lah
ya the other one is ya
so ya that was quite interesting day lah because like I think I was just spewing a lot of information on jaden and jaden was like eh wait wait wait ah walao walao
ya he was so lost and I felt so bad because like
I only
ya I tell you later the other thing later
no I tell you another thing later like so I just saw my schedule
like you know I've been on this
three shift for six months plus now right
so like
and it's because of my korean classes also so like
I told my boss lah I feel bad
um hogging this
seat in shift in this particular shift because the other juniors also need to try
this shift right so
err I requested to go to
so she said
okay she will see so I had this conversation with her in like september so I was supposed to move to
eh no in october sorry I was supposed to move to the this shift in
in what day ah
in october
suddenly I saw I was still in the shift one
so I was like what the hell
ya I asked her already she can take me out
into either a new shift or she tell me in advance that she's going to put me at a different timing but I will just ask for off on the days that I'm working lah
ya eh on the days that I have ya on the days that I have my
then like I and
I only found out about this
movement to this confirmed movement to because I had to ask
ya usually she will like
you're supposed to go to people when you're telling them like
oh you're changing shift
like it's normal to not go to people but this is because I'm changing clients
ya so it's quite
ya but now I'm going to change to shift
in december
same timing
three to twelve
bit earlier because my current shift is three thirty to twelve eh twelve thirty
then now it's like err three to twelve
I can but it's because of my timing for work
eh for my classes
ya
no no it's already been destroyed before
ya I did that
ya
ya lor so like
I'm quite excited because it's a new I've been on this shift forever right you know
I'm so tired
uh yes but then
um I'd have to
retake like I'd have to rearrange my korean classes uh
ya but I'm going on this shift for like three months
maybe three months around there
three months first
ya it feels like that correct
ya
and then like very hard to meet people hard to meet you meet friends meet family make plans I think it's the making plans that is a bit difficult uh
to
like follow my schedule because it's crazy for them to follow my schedule
I'm
my sleep is deprived
twelve thirty
I have to sleep
and then I have to wake up at like I don't know six seven
go to work ya
ya correct correct so it's especially with my korean class it's even more harder because
it's in the afternoon then if I have to meet people at night then I can't sleep
know what I mean
ya
mm
it's like
if I were to sleep in kan that's literally my whole work day
gone so it doesn't feel like an off
ya
sleep ya
ya
correct correct
don't know I don't know I think
high chance right that I will be on this shift
for six months
maybe because this
this shift right
only one malay can take
this particular shift for
so like
a lot of the malays in my
my my team lah at least they are
they are not big fans of
um
this client
this huh
yes but
you can always learn uh you know what I mean
and it's a job ah you are getting paid
plus
ya
you just learn ah you know what I mean
this job my job also you don't even need
a
particular degree I have one of my colleagues whose who took chemistry
she applied
for this job because this job entry level is it's good for entry level people uh because it's it's you learn on the job kind of thing you know as long as you're good with computers
and excel you're good to
you're you're good
ya
yup
yes correct
ya
ya
so I mean it's good lah I I think I've been stuck on the previous shift for too long
like this current shift that I'm on lah I've been too complacent
um
I don't know I I just I
what's the word ah complacent uh when like
when you let things pass
easily now
like last time I used to ya last time I used to be like super like whoa like you know about this like
like oh because we have to we have to make like
a clock report right every ten
you have to send a report so around nine to ten or eight to ten we start proofreading
the
sentence structure the
numbering for the all that all that answers lah
so
then now I'm just like
skimming through instead of going job by job one which is bad but like
like I one time I caught myself doing it uh
like last month or what then I realised oh shit this is very bad I need to
be more serious of my job
or ask for a change in environment
ya
ya then people you work with also makes a big difference ah
whether they
can work with you or not ah like listen to what you say
or like they are able to
reserve
ya
three fifty I wait for papers to come in so papers come in three fifty
I've to download the papers from this um
this file
then like
um from this file three fifty I download already then we have to read the papers at
we have to read and like make headlines and
like type out the headlines lah like what are the headlines for today so
so one person will have to say what send headlines
yes five in the morning
send headlines lah ya
so have to send headlines so someone has to say like oh I'm going to send headlines today
so if you happen to be partnering or like in a team with someone who
doesn't speak up or doesn't like who has no initiative it's going to be very tiring if you keep
people if they want it they have to say it
first if not I will take it and I will get it done
ya like
correct
correct so you
me if I were to ask things like that right it will make it me seem like
I'm not a I'm not
like I cannot be I cannot make decision like I'm indecisive
I just want people to I have to be like smart about it uh when I when I think that people are not doing it
ya
ya and
ya
mm
often time
but now
there was like this team that
full of seniors very jaded seniors
jaded ya
they don't like their new people in this shift
or like their newer people in this shift
mm
wow
they're going to they're going to cringe at this
so bad
so bad so bad
ya so
no jaden is actually my senior
he came in before me
yes
okay now they'll think that you're trying to be smart they know this
they know this
you're not trying to break the form or anything they know this
no
I don't know
I think so
I'm so sorry for the person who has to transcribe this
do you need us to read a dictionary we can do that too
this whatever can pick up
people
mm
mmhmm
it's too loud
okay
okay
mm
ya lah
no but I just
kind of conversation
oh so they have to do it again and it's so hard to find a quiet place
everything is so noisy we live we live in a you know what I mean and we're our neighbours are so close to each other literally there's a guy
banging on the damn
dustbin door ringing through like all the blocks
ya
right but it's okay lah I think it is their job lah
a'ah lah
weeb
weeb do you have that in the dictionary weeb
weeaboo
I don't think so please don't
maybe don't ya maybe don't
mmhmm
I don't know is it new
what is it about
mmhmm
okay

no lah actually I don't know how they transfer
of movies you know what I mean
to
no no like how they distribute movies overseas in this time you know like do they send the film over is there someone who comes
hilarious
films ah
projector lor
I think that's I think so
probably ah they probably don't live up to the name now probably it's expensive
I think I think projector is the closest we can find to that ah
artefacts like
mm
ya the effect lah but
that's the beauty of it
mm
the actual thing
ya ya
correct correct
ya
yes
mmhmm
okay
that's the maximum resolution ah
mm
four K two thousands
what you mean
mmhmm
mm
yup
mmhmm
mmhmm
of course
mm okay
yup
mm

ah like that
ya isn't it interesting
oh no
I think he's hungry are you hungry
okay speedy
ya

E R ya something like that auteur yes so like they have their own style of so it's like
christopher nolan or whatever you know what I'm saying
Gong Cha
Gong Cha
okay
okay
mm
okay but okay can but filming is very um it's a very
flexible
project
in terms of you have to be able to be flexible if things don't work out
so if let's say you will have like you said you had a certain shot in mind right
sometimes the environment doesn't allow for that to happen
so you have to like manage your expectations and also your
ya manage your expectations ah
to get that shot you know what I'm saying
calm down
mm
ya lah
yes
yes
ya be a
be a realistic director and a writer
english
mix also can
what kind of themes would you want to input in like the movies that you make
mmhmm
to your brain ya
mmhmm
type of genre right
twist ya
age
understand
mm
what's a movie that you think
psychologically was it like
stimulating for you
mmhmm
okay
ya the one with the natalie portman
mm
mmhmm
uh huh
ya ya ya
but it's not very is it psychological though
it's very it's more nostalgia now
uh huh
uh huh
uh huh
mm
yup
ya
ya
mmhmm
yup
changed
and they played around with the splicing and all that
kind of put it upon themselves also what
mm
a'ah
ya
a'ah
mmhmm
and the
ya
okay what other movies
the wailing yes yes yes yes yes definitely
correct
ya
yes
a'ah seh
oh
correct ya right
mm it's every it's all the things that I appreciate in films put together and like whoa I was so surprised eh
do the people that you know now are they like
who are they you know what I mean make me make me question my current relationships with like people that I know like my family even are they the people they are
ya sia
exactly
wah you know when he went through the house
was he supposed to or was he not supposed to
like you know how they say like the
I hope this isn't a spoiler for the person listening to this
like the family will die or something like that right so he went through right
but was he supposed to or not
I forgot about that
a'ah
mm
ya
mm mm
ya
mm
you're also insignificant
correct correct
mm
uh then who did I watch with
this indonesian woman
uh can watch online if you want eh you want to watch today
ya
why
mm
I still haven't watch actually that's why I
ya
but ya I think that one will be quite interesting
because it's ya
don't know ah movies are
just tough stuff ah because
there's a lot of planning to put into it if we want to start our own
film
ya
ya
mmhmm
ask someone who's in the scene that you know of do you know do you have any contacts
wah
okay okay I also had scriptwriting
I had a filmmaking class also
okay
then it will be just this uh you know like like the the when you do all the project by yourself then it's just all your name right
done by whatever written by no then like it's just two of us and then plus the actors or whatever then it will just be the same thing directed by written by produced by blah blah blah
mm
mm
you
I want to see a produced by me
but like you see ah
these kind of things need money
I know but where you how are you going to live
ah okay
we're not going to put our whole heart and soul into it right
yes yes
ya but like not all your and not all your money
two months for filming at most if you're lucky
ah but it's there's people to I mean there's people and actors to deal with also what
and we have our jobs also if we have a job when you have a job
ya that's if I can off day that
meets with your off day
know what I mean
ya
but okay lah not that bad
han orh
why
okay
okay
mm
mm understand
okay
I don't know how to check how do I check
haven't played a lot of games yet but I will try it later I have a lot of time
mm I try play on Borderland lor
I I haven't bought yet
expensive no
mm
I kind of blew my money on Shopee for the eleven eleven sale
but I bought really stupid things eh like ugh
things for speedy for my cat
um
I bought camera through you right I bought webcam for my
computer but it doesn't even work now later you need to check whether it works
because like
what else ah
oh I bought masks
okay later I will show you I bought the remember I told you I bought um
to for the mugen train I bought the demon slayer masks
I I I I I only want one which is the
nezuko one
I ordered four
of course lah but like I have other masks too
ya but I I'm a bit scared of being like
to be seen as a weeb
mmhmm
ya
adli's watching
ya
does it feel ya does it feel like it cheapens the
movie now that everybody watches it or do you think it's doesn't matter
I feel like when everybody watches it
the special
ya
ya
uh huh
correct they need to
ya
accessible
ya
it becomes very accessible uh that's the thing
but I mean it comes with goods also ah because like
thankfully
due to the
or haikyu maybe it's gotten quite popular
it's so easy to find
like if if it's a very niche show it's very hard to
appreciate it better with like merchandise or support them more like artist more
which is what's the english name
okay
mm
a'ah
mm
ya so that's what I'm talking about ah
hard to be a fan when they're not very
ya
mm
so like
okay understand
mmhmm
okay
oh
busy
for korean dramas also
ya
um because I don't know ah it's different ah it's a different
country different things they appreciate I just talked to my
err
she's very she's very quiet lah but
she doesn't follow a lot of
korean
things even though she's taking korean class
interested in the culture
we watch K dramas
so like
this lady she doesn't
indulge in these things
like she's just taking it for fun uh
how about japanese content how are they like then she's oh she doesn't actually watch a lot
there are not
as many well known
um
japanese dramas
if you think about it
kind of true or J or J like
ya japanese drama like those with episodes
you don't do you know any
ya exactly
apart from anime like
ya real dramas
um
it's not as popular lah in japan
so ya that's why she said she didn't then I ask her what she does in her free time so oh I just do writing because she does err makeup
like uh she studies
err what's that called cosmetics I think
um I'd say she's in her mid thirties
ya her husband is in singapore lah that's why she's here also
ya
I don't think so I think they're both japanese
probably ya but then she said she's going back to japan next year
for new year's
so she might not join the class but anyway I asked her like how's
then she said oh she actually like didn't like school a lot because
she just didn't like it lah then she said she prefer being out
no I don't think maybe I don't know
ya
but she's she
um like during high school and all that
I get to talk to so many people from other countries in my class there's a taiwanese girl
there's a indonesian lady there's a vietnamese girl
and this japanese lady so like half the class is
international so like
I'm I'm closer to the indonesian one lah because
for in terms of safety
general safety and for COVID ah
jakarta
ya lah
but she used to live in yoyga also yogyakarta
very nice ah they all very nice people I'm just very glad
I I guess
I don't know they would look as I don't know
I mean different people are different lah what are you talking about
speedy ya so
it was quite fun
taking korean I think I can understand a lot
of like whether I watch
I can try
I can try but just know you can check what okay okay
ah I have a lot I have a lot teed up in my
uh huh
okay
okay give me give me like give me two more months
because it takes me one month to finish one term
so like give me two more months maybe I'll be more pro
kidding
um
I mean we are learning from a child's
perspective but we are adults so we understand it better right
so um I'm I'm guessing if I were to go korea now I can speak basic
in the thousands so like
when your and you must because numbers are different also they have korean numericals
they have chinese numericals
ya correct
yes so like um
to speak that language you know what I'm saying
correct I mean that should be the case for some kids what
definitely you'd know how to speak more than
ya you'd know this right since it's your ya so
it's just
whatever a korean weeb is
when I try to speak korean
ya koreaboo
but it's because I want to improve but I just bought key caps
from Shopee
ya I'll show you later it's very very nice bro
wah I don't know how to explain it's like it shines through and it's very clear because I was a bit
suspicious
when I saw ya when I saw online lah because you know how you don't trust anything online ya that's why
you can't really trust a lot of things online so
um I used to because it was cheap but it was originally about twenty plus dollars
no it was eighteen and then during eleven eleven it was
fifteen dollars like wow and like it's hundred and four eh
and and I'm quite lucky that it
and it um
that it fits
ya
it's they say it's for Logitech eh
say it's for Logitech

for lunch
so expensive
the delivery
newton eh
okay lah the feels to eat satay is there
what time is my breakfast
okay
mmhmm
eh eh
wah
no lah okay first few times he asked me
I mean I don't want to say his name lah
but ya
then like after that people keep asking me
like we exchanged stories lah and then turns out that he has been asking around
and then like he has never bought his own pack of cigarettes which is like weird
oh no
until a certain while we all stopped giving and then he like go to another group of people to ask like
like
and like the cheese is there
ya
um mostly like indian malay food lah know the the normal kind
woodlands eh
like
make you put on put on weight faster
okay
mm
satay eh
mm
oh
mm
google maps says that there is a bus
high eh
mm
wah
I don't think I can make it lah if I wanna go venture into that kind of industry
mm
straight ahead
okay so
turn left here and then we got to take the overhead bridge
ah okay I can see already I can see the lights from here
ah
mm mm
okay
mm
mm
the night is still young seh
you know that I have oversized shirts right
wah grabhitch eh
very lucky
ya grabhitch very rare you know people get grabhitch
I mean I feel like it depends on your luck what because like let's say the driver is going wherever you're going
and then the driver happens to be in the same area as you
then you will get it what
mm
ah okay lah
mm mm
wah
mm mm
mm
mm
az
people say
don't cry over spilled milk tau
for my birthday but then we cannot go bali right so I want to eat indonesian food
mm
okay lah that's like
soon in six days
but we need to
save some money for dinner lah if you want to plan for dinner
mm
do you think that our generation our malay language is
sort of like bad
because I think our generation don't use malay words
very often
at home okay for myself lah in my opinion at home also
I mean I think for my
household situation I speak to my mum to all my family members in english
speak
mm
no okay do you even okay maybe you do lah but do you think that majority of the population know their neighbours do you think that they like everyone would actually
talk to their neighbours nowadays
not really like what if they close their doors
and windows
ya
mm
mm
I think we grew up differently lah
ah
I wanted to watch a movie because it's been a while since we I don't know about you it's been a while since I last watched a movie and then
uh wonder woman two
it's coming out soon
eh wonder woman seh
that's the villain lah for this movie
I don't think you need
I don't think you need to be a fan seh to watch a movie a movie is a movie just appreciate what has been created it's like it's an art
you have to appreciate what has been given to you
it's gonna be so
mm mm
money makes the world go round eh
ya lah
but
mm
uh maybe we do something different lah you know that they have this like
you know those uh escape rooms
in the room itself they have this new one
where its virtual reality
world ah through the eyes
ya anyways those uh virtual reality rooms ya we can consider doing that I think
I think it's about
forty five minutes ah
okay lah if you calculate it's like one minute one dollar
you have to accommodate to um all the group who you know that uh not all our friends like to LAN right
mm mm
but the future is bleak right now bro
that's why we are balanced
hais
eh
mm mm
and then my next pay probably is twenty twenty one
new year new me wah
um
ya
so
huh that's a I think this topic of like what to eat
it's like
a deep dark hole you know
because like
so much difficulties thinking about what to eat
what to eat nevermind you you need to think about whether you want to order in and then like there's the delivery fee and all that to consider
context of
having the difficulty to
choose what to eat
mmhmm
catching
mm
okay
so
ya
wah wah wah wah wah
ya lah because twenty dollars divide by six people
mm
too emotional sometimes
it's true
hmm
okay lah
I mean it's just like to some people
and
the booking for the staycation
wait so need to let them know lah tomorrow morning
no because we never talk about when to tell them
so we need to let them know tomorrow morning when we wake up on the way to work
eh just message the group lah we have a group
ah
wait is it
I was looking at the furnitures lah to like maybe buy I don't know I haven't make any decisions yet
but have you seen the loft bed
the linie loft bed
I mean ya the our website lah bedandbasics our company website then after that I was looking at this linie loft bed
and then I mean the price is on the higher end
but the bed looks so good the black one
wasted
why
the what
what promotion
how much was the promotion
huh spend six hundred wait wait wait wait wait spend six hundred dollars get fifty dollars off you can use on the spot
so that's five hundred fifty lah
but okay that doesn't matter ah
because I didn't have money back then so
but ya now I have money and I'm looking at the furniture and the furniture looks good the black colour one
like
the the I don't know lah maybe it was the picture the the whole aesthetic of it with the and the nift loft bed
ya I'm living for that like
I want that kind of
design now in my room
because
I would from the from the plant by the side
I want it there also
I mean the can be different lah
because I wanna buy a better brand better quality
then buy like a a sofa bed and then like that will be used as a sofa
ya
I've seen the reviews
and like
on all the
e-commerce or like startups from like bloggers vloggers or whatever
a lot of them give good reviews
and another one was the
ah LUMOS aura projector
and then ah projector
ya and I but because like I don't know I can't decide whether I wanna buy a or the projector
I don't know because like there's pros and cons for both
because let's say if I move out with a projector is easier
then with a it's more bulkier but then if I want to play games or anything
like
cause ya lah
ah adulting is so hard sometimes you know
ya
so
I don't know
mmhmm
uh huh
kan I also had that concept
money is a big factor
can you imagine we find the you know there was this mouse hunt recently
the ten thousand dollars mouse hunt by the squeaky uh
ah the concept is like that you find
the winner who the winner who finds it will get ten thousand dollars
can you imagine the amount of money
and then we still have spare
we can uh I mean
divide lah the money then I would probably wanna buy like a a new laptop
for school
mm mm
alhamduls
mm all the best for that
like that's the thing about humans lah
when you get extra
complain when you get shortage complain it's like our culture
hais
I would prefer to spend that money on food then on grab
ya lah
kan the first few music we won't be sleeping also
cause like we will get comfortable
what lah you don't want to watch like this
mm
so come come up with a new idea eh
munch nibble on something
it's cool
thick and juicy
a'ah
mm mm

hello hello
ideal vacation it would be
comfortable very casual very um spontaneous kind of ah trip I like that kind of ya I mean I I mean
for me it will be spring and when
I got a I got a
my cousin who went to korea before he said that ah it's super duper cold he went there during winter so so it's super duper cold so if you want to go there during winter better get prepared like
all the necessary staff for you to stay warm so I'm like ya it it's interesting ya for me but ya to your question it will be spring spring is my I think it'll be
tour guide in singapore I mean singapore got a lot of interesting and like places to go but if I were a tour guide I will bring them
it's very interesting question ah I'll bring them
to
uh oh my god
I say there's a lot of places but I can't think err err
oh ya okay maybe ya ya maybe if you want to
ah I remember you know the masjid sultan area what do you what what what area is that ah
ya okay I was I was thinking of what's
err kampung glam
five stones they have five stone ah they have five stones and they have like they have this handmade paper plane
and then they have another one with the handmade ah where you it's a paper ball where you need to blow on it and then in order for it to to expand then make into a round shape then you can just you know play it around like that
from what I heard from my friends like I'm more to like the old side of of like I mean ya I'm that I I give that kind of vibe to them lah like I I really like oh like old school style like you name it like for me like it's very very fun and interesting for me ah
happy family you mean yes
oh I think you will know my answer I will I really am a fan of uh you name it anything that is korean-related korean drama especially ya so if you were to ask me it's korean drama it's because of
so like I got into korean drama is because of one of my friends um she suggested me this one at at that point of time of the year ah the title was boys over flowers
it brings me back so much lah like that was the joy that I found in watching like
I think basically I like korean I korean korean type of drama they have they have lot of genre like romance thriller they even have like ah
they I mean they have a lot lah but ya I think I'm more to like those kind of like stuff like friends family and such how about you
verbally
oh I like
we watch the same thing ya ah kitchen nightmares
oh those were the days I tell you yes I do watch catfish is I think is the number I don't say it's number one but it was on right at that point of time ya I remember watching catfish I was like it's so interesting like how can that guy that host
found out about okay let's let's ah go into this and then you just type your profile and all that stuff then how like wah like wah you bring me back so much to to the time where ya
naive
err how do I say this I'm not the type because I don't usually use those type of apps that people use nowadays to connect to a friend or to find someone I don't dare to use it because I heard a lot of stories sometimes like like you say lah
it might be I mean I I'm thankfully enough because I'm not on that side of it I never tried any apps so I never gotten catfish before but I heard stories of
so I'm like how can they do that like even they even it went viral before on a social media where there's this this person use a influencer
photo to just catfish people on this app so I'm like how can how can people
I mean ya I mean
ya I I got nothing to say about that but you know
talking about kitchen nightmares though it would these kind of shows also make me mad it will make me want to watch it's cause how interesting like gordon ramsay is there to help like no matter how rude or how bad the person is he's like ah
like that that's the that's the thing I like about gordon ramsay he don't care about what other people says but because he's just there to help you he's he's genuine enough to help you so and ya kitchen nightmare also got fun side of the stories also
oh ya ya ya
movies
uh
oh movies would be harry potter yes harry potter is
ya harry potter is the one lah I mean I watched
from the season season one to like I think I I I forgot how they got too many but ya their their movie in each and every series is so good I mean ya it's because I think is the connection of
the ending of the story makes you wanna know more usually they end it the movie like you need to wait for the next next movie to to know to find out so that makes me and I mean wizard is like
very unique and interesting what
eh it is so good I wish I wish uh I could you know get that that kind of uh if it was to exist in singapore lah or in anywhere like like you could get that skill like we got a wizard school or anything ya how about you
oh no okay okay I know
oh okay okay alright alright
yes that is
how ah you know that kind of thing I mean like bollywood movies are all
generally good what
oof cartoon I can say I watch a lot of cartoons but from what I know from my siblings I love to watch teletubbies I you know I I remember I had
tinky-winky is the purple one the first one with the red handbag
I think of I don't I don't
each and every one of them has their own
then for po they have the scooter ah po was unique he because po was younger then po has the the scooter
but ya tinky-winky tinky-winky also is like
very unique because he has ah a red handbag with him
ya so ya I grew up watching tinky-winky I got
ya the character is ah
it's a it's a it's a squid right it's a squid ya ya it's it's it's interesting how about you
ya I'm sorry about that I know I mean it's ya
oh sesame street
oh
I get it
oh no if me it will be
if me it will be err
uh oh ah err I think it would be ya like I say it's boys over flowers soundtrack that's ah same like you when I got into boys over flowers that's where I get to know K pop that's why I get to know certain groups form because of the
ya that's ya I mean like ya
of course of course yes yes
ah titanic
err it'll be money health and food
I mean kan it's important in everyday life what you need to eat to get your energy to get to start your day and everything so food
ya that's just a wish lah but ya money and health health of course health is very important for us lah as we grow older we need to take care of our well beings and all stuff right and ya that is all ah ya oh I have another question for you
ah
if you have unusual superpower what would it be
ya for me it will be err read people's mind
I wish it could exist but I mean ah you know
ah food it's always about food ah in the end it's always ah it's I don't know maybe food or
I know ya exactly that's the downside of reading people's mind too lah what if you found out something that you are not supposed to find out but
alright so how about ah
K got another question for you okay err
let me I'm still thinking about the question
for you so ya ya ah okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
exactly
interesting
mm mm mm
that's true
mm I get what you mean
what was ah the thing that I wish was free yours was very spot on question is education for me I more to
so ya it pays a lot of factors so I believe if we if
it was free like we can shop whatever we want I think we will find enjoy stuff for everyone ya so
err oh I got this is another interesting and unique question that I found uh if humans no longer needed to work to survive what will we think we will do
yes yes this quite interesting
ya I agree I agree with you if me I will think
if we do not longer need to work I think we will be doing gardening
I mean you know garden is I mean to some it'll
a very for me it's kind of like a very peaceful uh peaceful what do you call ah called a procedure you call it that ya I mean like it will be interesting like you can see your neighbours like
starfruit
it was so interesting because I never ever saw a starfruit plant before so it's like it's quite big
like a lot sorts of like plants and you know like ya
ah ya yes
hobbies actually wah hobbies I would say there's a lot I mean I think one thing for me is baking you know me lah
I I love to bake I think I I I since I started baking when I was I think I tried to venture out during secondary school may actually
so it's like when comes to ya I think my hobby is baking for now lah I try I like to venture out on a lot of stuff like I mean I vacant I used to like bake like ah I think one of my successful bake was a oreo cheesecake that was
I mean it depends on the person practising uh
I mean for me it's best to practise first than you I mean some people like to gamble they just like ah
why not you just try you know believe in yourself and just go for it you know but for me I'm I'm the type where practise first you know just to be safe than you know just to gamble like you know do do whatever whatever
stuff lah ya
of course yes
pop malay they call it ya how about you how about you
oh
I go with my sister I go with my sister uh to this to this to this concert um concert
eye-opening experience for me cause like you experience them singing live some more is like
they are the iconic band that people recognise all over the world like it's not only it's not only the singaporeans were there were a lot of ah other people from countries who came to singapore to just watch them westlife
so it's like it was really I remember it was really fun that day and some more it falls on my sister's birthday so ya how about you
I know it's always it always happen ya ya ya
oh it really happen in front of your eyes ah I know okay
I decided to not recently I think last year I decided to purchase a lot of accessories I'm in I'm I started to get interested in accessories so especially in earrings
you can say like err laces you know lace there there is one lace earring where you like
need to sew on it and you know you create and stuff so for me I'm more to like very simple and very casual nothing not so dramatic and all and of stuff ya I'm curious about yours how about you
brown ah brown red call it lah orange uh this kind of colours that I'm more to
love talking about love I suddenly so shy no lah kidding love at first sight
um
I'm not sure about love at first sight but I believe that we are all
there's there's what do they call that destiny is it
destiny to like it's already like there's a
partner for us lah but love at first sight
I kind of I mean not I kind of I used to I used to to you know look look at like eh oh my god like maybe I'm interested but then it'll
make me think back like will I really interested to like I mean get to know that person really like
their lifestyle and all that all the stuff ya for me like
I'm on a neutral side basically uh ya very interesting how how what what do you think
oh I understand K K
oh my god okay
fall in love with that person just because of your first sight or the looks or
or another thing ya
so I got ah another question for you
uh oh you talk err oh okay K if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
yes correct
I would oh wait this is very interesting because I got a few countries I would like to stay in mind but if our alamak this also very hard lah I mean
I am basically like I said I love korea so much down to the culture but if I were to really pick like
if I were to stay there for the rest of my life I think it would be australia or new zealand
I mean I think mostly australia australian and new zealand
because of many singaporeans too live there currently right so it's like
closer to home also so australia is also quite an interesting ah country to I'll say I'll say australia ya it's very quite a interesting country to live in I think I look as if as australia is very kind of a chill country I would say
for my heard experience from my from my friend who went there so far heard stories about that ah from my friend went to australia it was ya I'll pick australia I think is is I think is like well ya everybody will pick australia I I don't know I don't know ya but how about you
ya that's the thing I I'm torn between sorry I'm I torn I'm torn between korea and australia but I mean I think I'm more scared to live in korea because of their culture is much
more I mean how do how do I say this mean they I mean
it's hard lah to say but then I mean every country all have different different type of culture and different type of err
different type aiya basically it's culture lah but ya sorry what were you saying
of course definitely
that's the ya that's the number one thing for for us
oh no uh huh
ya ya correct correct ya ya
oh no okay
oh
ya of course me too I won't I I I I myself also don't like to stay in one place I would like to know like safe is singapore lah like you wanna go to this one place like what this place only what what for we will go like eh let's go eat here ya then after this we go eat there then we go to another place another place
ya talking about talking about just now you said about tourists right did you mention tourist ya ah what would the place that you usually love to go in singapore in singapore any places
oh of course of course
any sound eh
when you see sunflower for me lah for me I don't know about other people when I see sunflower it lifted up my mood cause of the colour then it just make you smile some more it can grow so big and tall in other countries I'm like how can they grow up so big like that I wish I could grow that tall and big sunflower in our country I mean but ya ya but the sad thing is that I'm not good at
gardening or planting I mean once I plant something it will take a few months then after that
after that it will you know I I ya

like I say if I can plant as tall as big as what other countries do why not
of course of course it give you ah much more
it will give you an eye-opener basically and it it give you more energy when looking at
make us forget about the busy life in this ah singapore you know singapore is now so busy so when you look at plants or like any flowers
it will take you away from ah from that side that busy lah that side ya
ya so it's really nice to hear all of these lah I also really agree with you on all this cause it's

one
oh nevermind lah
oh no lah I was just looking at the jurassic mile
um
I think track in changi airport
today or some some some time maybe I I dah
err is it sedap mania or something quite cheap right if I'm not wrong

so hopefully that one day I will reap the benefits lah
so what do you think how about you
huh serious
ya lah ya lah
ah
alcohol
things that
are not allowed lah in islam so I think in generally if you know the company
and like you know what they do right you will have an idea on
what they invest in so if like if they are halal then you just go ahead lah with it
segregate your assets lah so I think one good err platform to that we can use is
I as far as I know this is the
so based on that right they will just take your money invest in the different kinds of
uh
um and ya and this kind of company is like you don't need
uh forget about it
so I think that better than like putting in a bank
and
and nothing will grow in a bank
right
oh okay so like
err ten
ten singapore dollars I think for per transaction which means if you want to find your account right if the bank will deduct ten dollars as a service charge lah then when you want to withdraw also they will they will charge you ten dollars so this is one one of the downside lah of of using
wahed invest
um
how to say eh
what err things you have to face lah if you want to go through the halal way
ya so you have to put up lah with this all these service charge lah when these banks
new way
true
do it the halal way then it's the best lah
ah correct
a'ah deep
ya correct lah I mean because anyway singapore there's not many options I don't think there's any
options for halal investing also
if I'm not wrong ya so I mean you must start with with
okay lah ya
jalan kayu ah
I okay
ya correct
oh

not say I'm good at the game lah but like I understand how
people play the game so like
it is actually quite hard to master the game also

mm mm
mm mm mm exactly
that maybe that's why they want to do that's why they want to do with the movie they want to do something like the comics
it also make a lot of money so
oh ya ya ya
huh
oh I get it I get it I get it
deadpool
forty minutes
ya
mm mm
we can actually do that I think actually we supposed to do that right now we just talking among among ourselves it's actually the same thing what
so technically it's like a zoom call just you and me talking
for one hour
mm

eh shit ya ya
ya sia
oh oh oh okay
are you gonna buy the new five
laptop you sure your laptop can handle all the games you want to play
bandwagon
really ah
oh ya true true true true
like what are the games you actually play
ya what I I do that also I play a lot of games actually I play like
don't say first person shooter lah
oh so you like mm mm you you you will buy a but you wouldn't buy a because you want to play games is like a casual work
ah ah I see I see
so if you ever wanna
ah if you ever want to buy buy a
like like err don't buy pre build like you buy the parts yourself okay I mean like
don't buy don't buy you should make yourself
but
but but I got but but but like
there are shops where they you need you choose the parts
then they will build it for you
then is also a better option
ah
like thirty frames per second to maybe below that and
ya
oh
oh ya ya
exactly exactly like that the
like you cannot
like your base four and your base X box one it doesn't work like it's unplayable
like
ya ya
I don't watch tiktok lah but like I saw that on twitter a lot of people complaining
then but they say like the best is like five ah or seems like the next gen consoles lah of course I'm not surprised lah
technically depends lah but I think what what I think is hardware problem because the four
uh huh like long time ago
so like like you know next gen they can handle this kind of thing
that's why
you know got
you know got the footlocker one the wah the
cause
okay lah true true true
but also like partially
ya ya ya
ya ya COVID nineteen also
exactly
then like I I watch some I watch some like videos they say like
the footlocker should have like actually do like an online job instead and like not
like not the
ya ya understand also lah so that right now I don't think there's actually any actual solution to this
uh uh best raffle lah ah actually yes that is the best lah
boxes are shoes lah obviously behind his bedroom
I I don't have picture but I got see picture before lah ya
he
he I don't know what type of shoes he wears lah but he got the I think the jordans or some stuff like that lah I don't know lah
I'm I'm not that shoe person you know I'm not a high piece is that what you guys call yourself
uh shoe fanatic I'm not I'm not that man
ah oh ya that's the word sneaker head shoe fanatic
no
huh for real ah
social distancing they have to know what social distancing is in malay
oh and
jetty
oh you know
that
took took some time to like clean the beach or something lah but
it's very clean right now
maybe they cleaned that up ah
yo but but it was so clean I was quite amazed like woo
faith in humanity you know
is it tomorrow today ah today lah yes today
err actually I hate that
like want to sit together
but they cannot sit together because
that there got some restaurants they don't allow people to sit they don't allow families to sit together ya cannot
then you split ah three three ah no choice lah
ya
but I hope like
ya for me lah but I hope like they do something like eh okay lah eight people not bad lah
but then I just I just hope you know the
uh huh err
yo but actually duh wah okay so you got anything you want to say before we end sir darwin
there are like thirty seconds left
ah hopefully ah inshaallah amin
okay lah but it's
and I mean it is has been like
it's been very natural right we do it as natural as we can right
it's not it's not scripted or anything for real though it's just

ah alright okay so
you know how we started on sixteen
then after that
ah it was very
simple the flow was simple and everything right
so they will bring you through a phase where you have to go for a club interview
okay
and then there are more trainings and delegations of jobs that you have to do
so uh
set of tactics to use and gegenpress tiki-taka all all pre-default
okay but then
mm so there's more tactical freedom lah in that sense
pre-default four four two four two three four five one whatever lah so there's a lot of different different different types of tactics to choose and play with but then ah
four two three one
so there is no restrictions on that however
kan
uh
mm
mm
yes
but is your central midfielder place like could deep deep lying box to box everything kan this guy is more for box to box player but he move towards the wings
and not towards the front or the end or the goal
ah
so
mm
I have yet to check spanish league
belgian I think belgian league don't have then err
all those minor minor small small leagues lah
I haven't check got I haven't really properly explored the game lah yesterday lah I mean
I tried a few clubs ah yesterday like err dortmund
then I switch over to uh chelsea then I switch over again to zagreb then switch over now I'm back at dortmund
cause you know
players and formation wise is really very very different from what we are used to lah
was four years orh
that's four years difference you know
siol
sixteen will be come out fifteen pe ah
uh
by right they should be launching in september october lah but cause of the COVID nineteen situation
clubs are still going on there are transfers and whatnots so err
twenty is free on epic games
it's not a trial it's a full game for free
ah so if you don't want to wait for twenty one then just download for twenty first ah
at the end of day it's free pe if you don't like it you can just go and spend money and buy the twenty one pe
okay so then
Acer
Acer nitro five
it's a inbuilt graphic card that
still can be able to run sixteen so I feel like it should be fine ah
there there might be but but I don't think cause the simulation games do not run
I don't think there'll be much of a issue when it comes to graphic cards and and whatnot lah cause graphic is very very minimal
should be no issue ah
it's quite big ah
okay
I think should be no issue already lah cause most of the player both of the game is data to data data to data
no cause
I
how I see if what you say is true touch is for
very very detailed
outliers
so means he doesn't mix with any of the social groups so he feel left out
ah
so they add a psychological concept to the game tau
so then your core players kan the core backroom where it comprises of most of your senior players
your highly influential players and everything kan
these people can shape your entire backroom just just like that
so if this player not happy with you they cause ruckus
ah
so it's
a more psychological concept in that game ah
no cause
okay you see eh it doesn't mean that influential person in one club is an influential person in another club
cause your influential players is players that been there the longest tau
ah
ah then from there he'll become a senior influential member
it's like my dortmund case is
hummels was from bayern pe
cause one thing is
he's a foreigner
ya so he's the only english playing the entire team
ah you'll feel complete outlied cause
you cannot fit into any social group that easily
cause of the language barriers and whatnot
mm
mmhmm
he will
it depends on how well he adapt into their club lah
doesn't have his friends he cannot be influential player there cause he still new pe even though he's old
then after that you cannot win games no matter how good your tactic is
your tactic may beat barcelona five NIL and everything but then if your players are not cohesive enough as a unit you cannot go and play apa
I mean that's what happened during barcelona eight two defeat to bayern munich
the dressing room wasn't cohesive enough
there's a lot of fighting in between
creates a huge factor in
your performance as a team lah
mm
mmhmm
mm
no no no no no no
cause you already technically purchase for it already
mm
but then let's say you have uh twenty on your steam account okay
your twenty steam or your steam can be
crossover to your steam uh epic games account
you can you can try ah I mean the downloads speed may be quite slow lah cause
it's quite a big game lah but I connected straight to my LAN cable so it was quite fast for me lah
ah seriously
oh K K K K
okay ah then those things do not need high internet speed everything
ah then I don't think that one can run lah
ah
internal cleaning tau
there's a few things that affect your your computer speed lah so dust is one thing
and then after that uh the make and model if it's outdated then
I have no idea about sixty thirty gig
just be prepared for the worst lah I mean
so it's very
it's quite intensive lah ah ha
eh eh
ya in a sense ah
oh okay
look the thing is I only found out about the social group thing today
so before I met you I was I was looking through the game again lah to familiarise myself with what the hell is going on kan so
in this version was the medical centre
ah so you can jump into the medical centre to see your injured players
I don't know why they think that would be a good addition to your
hide players to icloud so then you go to medical centre you can see which players injured then can see how long they injured for
then maybe there is
interactions and whatnot lah I haven't really jump into medical centre yet lah you can explore it later ah
I mean honestly if we've bought the game during circuit breaker eh whoa that would be damn good
oh you just press play play play play for ages siol
oh ya there is a singapore league inside ah ya
ah you
I mean this is a precedented situation pe
they do go home
and the game realised that actually they went off for holiday and they cannot come back due to borders being closed
then there's an issue you have to settle lah I mean ah like like there's one club
in twenty you can try to manage bolton wanderers
lead one club
okay the issue with that club is they on the verge of bankruptcy
okay so you start the game
without the full squad
okay so most of your players that you start with are semi-pro
so slowly you have to sign them to a professional contract then you have to
bring up players from youth intake everything so you really start the game with
zero money
minimum wages
half your squad missing ah
ah
all the north ah
even the north south are not semi-pro tau
they are pro you know
fall from grace ah I mean
financial difficulty
okay
remember the portmore's incident
okay so this is portmore times ten
the portmore they were able to sell off ah their assets and everything to keep the club afloat at the same time
they sold off a lot the high players away
and replace them with ah cheaper options so there wasn't so bad on their end lah cause they got rid of the budget first
but bolton wanderers is when they were relegated with championship they still kept most of the star players okay so then they paid
ah crazy wages to keep them alive and then they pay pay pay pay
but then they realised cause of financial difficulty their club will bankrupt they had to deduct the points
so you end up still going down pe
mm
it depends lah cause
unless you
liquidate the club ah
unless you dissolve the club ah
no
I buy over your club
so once you pump in assets your club
once your club is maintained at the state whereby
you're neither bankrupt you're neither rich you're just in between just nice to survive for the club right
whether your club is churning a loss or profit it doesn't matter to them as long as you're financially stable to keep your club afloat
cause as as you go relegated kan cause of the financial fair play rules uh you're only allowed a certain amount of money in your club
so the more you get relegated after a while you be quite stable cause the amount of money you have is let's say you have two K
okay in order for you to play a premier league you need maybe ten K so
so not enough money you relegate down to league one which needs three K not enough money you relegate down to league two then two K two K pe just nice your club will stay afloat
okay with small wages
and then play as what they are then there is no issue ah
unless
you been relegated down and you job's board to make very very bad decision along the way
then you still keep going down ah until you meet a league where
it fits your
financial ah
or
the board give up
liquidate the club
so they face financial difficulties they were in serie ah
okay serie A
ah
ha
third corruption
okay so what did club did was ah they had to stay afloat cause they do not have enough money to
ah to stay afloat lah so uh what juventus did was juventus pump in money for them
to keep them afloat but it wasn't enough so
instead of dropping
so I give you money I give you money I give you money we build a new club from scratch using the same name
ah then after that
you start off at the basic league then you climb up again ah
then whether your players from your old club want to stay in the new club
that's a whole different thing ah
but it is possible ah like clubs like
wimbledon wimbledon ah that is a new club by itself
cause they split from dons then they come out themselves
so
they are history of clubs going around like this ah where they disappeared they dissolve the club and they come out with a new club with the same name
english clubs wise there were a few but they are now in the you know
the bottom bottom leagues lah I mean you can go through wikipedia and they will tell you about this lah
there are a few clubs with history that
go around like this ah err one particular example I know is dons ah
dons and wimbledon but the one is more of a split decision
so then ah
english
I mean you think about it in singapore we have our S league
okay then we have our delta league
climb up the league as you progress along
okay then hopefully you're good enough with financial stability to go into S league but then
I mean
look look at our situation
you used to lah still am lah so it's a difference
definitely ah I mean look at your size
ya lah it's cause
no lah maybe and also cause
like one point of time where you stop playing for awhile pe
ya lah so then you you stop for how long after that
you do not have regular trainings you do not have regular exercise so
everything change lah
I
ya like
what my cousin did was during futsal kan before the pandemic situation ah then they said no slide tackle that was the rule no slide tackle
okay so imagine the players charging towards you eh running with the ball and everything
idea kan
you have to be innovative
you're bending the rules while stay in the rules referee couldn't say anything cause he wasn't sliding
his body was on the floor but he wasn't sliding
so they have to let it go
it was a tackle
if
I mean it's been six years right since you last played right so maybe you
how long has it been since you actually watch football
that still two years ago at least tau
no lah I mean
at the end of the day
solid sia
I forgot which year that was lah err
was it two thousand fifteen or two thousand ten ah around there lah
okay
there was one time where the when
those running for election they have to sit in front of of the camera
and give a speech as to why you should vote their party okay so ah every other party kan
so for the respective channels like channel five channel eight suria and the vasantham channel so uh every other channel they set down a member of
that race to talk in that language but for the
all across all four channels lee hsien loong face
talking all four languages
nobody dubbed over him ah
it was a thirty minutes speech
ya I mean
no lah I mean okay you see eh for their generation right
only for okay actually
for our generation eh for our generation ah at the most ah
our first language is usually english
quite solid
okay it's
so these are the kids where
their the english is a very first language mother tongue is their second language for our elders it's the other way
so obviously you only remember your first language pe cause that's the first language you're most fluent with
english ah cause
that's the language that we are used to
from but you said in ah
probably ah babe
I don't think it's depending on ah your mother tongue whether your mother tongue is your core language or english is your core language what I think is the language you're most proficient in lah
language that you use most often cause let's say kan
ah so that means
no
no that means you need when you grow you only remember english ah okay I mean
look at the americans they don't have a second language they only have one language pe english is their only language so when they grow they only remember english pe
so maybe let's say maybe they learn french or what along the way
then they cannot speak their french language cause they only remember that english language as a core subject
this a this is the language they use everyday
I mean at the end of day also
he will do one
okay but
I mean
eleven or eight eleven or eight ah screw it I go eight I go eleven first is eleven then I turn if wrong I just go down pe it's better than coming up kan the stairs kan okay eleven let's go
so the lift brought me up to eleven I open the door
ah thank god
I can tell lah I mean
is outside of house
ya there is a there's a ah
a cycle to work to look forward to lah everyday lah but now is just
I mean
you know how the you know how the market is now right you know I regret now is I did not extend my service longer
I really regret not extending my service longer even though I had to suffer inside lah
mean with the multiple sailings that I have to go for but at least it's there is a routine for me to follow
and at least I get paid
I get good pay you know but
haiya
it's a shame ah
no cause I know you tried to warn me but as I look forward in the schedule right
the schedule was really
whoa
singapore airlines send out their flights to nowhere kan
mm so you're burning a lot of fuels fuels cost money
cause
you're dishing out a lot of money but you're not getting back any money
I mean for ship wise it's different pe everyday you have to use your vessel
mm
no ah
it's still quite low lah but it's not
that low also lah I mean
car oil and uh jet fuel jet fuel is bloody expensive
so and they use how much cars use how much
you see that there's a huge difference ah
from how many litres to how many of litres ah so
no lah that one
it really depends on current situation ah I mean
as of now damn slow ah
to pick up ah
honestly this situation is worst when corona ah worst than SARS pe
so it's
no now cause now is cause of the trade war okay they fighting over the trade war
wants to be a superpower but china is really
rapidly coming up and they cannot stop
and recently recently government
ban the postal service from sending masks to every household in america
ah so then the
this this lady was saying wah this a very useful mask still can breathe I can be compliant but not be compliant
they are the first to die they are the first to die hello ah seh they are first to die
I mean the citizens are doing same thing lah so I
think logically lah I mean the reason what america are thinking like this also cause
the education in the system in the first place isn't good to begin with

yes
uh
ya I remember I saw the vinny guy lah and I can tell that he is very self-aware that people are talking about him ah
so I remember like just looking at him then like I was looking at shu then I was like eh
maybe we just go closer look ah then we we I don't know whether I was being very loud or he's just that attentive to people around him right but he was looking at us
then I was looking at him then I wanted to like um you're the shit bag who is having a weird relationship with this russian lady that is telling people how to do burlesque
err
and straits times so I was like thinking oh shoot I should have like told shu about it lah cause shu is always searching for
like articles to write about and it's going to like help her a lot more to err
like at least advance ah cause she's telling me that like right now she's just taking what people give her and like she
or if you yourself have something nice to talk about and can you know I can set it up you can be famous
do you know that shura is like two years older than me right like she's like my age right
wait that's this is a good question would you ever date someone younger than me
ya
I'm twenty four this year
I'm twenty four lah
and you're almost thirty
ya
no as in
you're twenty nine years old this year would you date her
what the heck
I can tell that you have uh very very no filter
my goodness
and that's something a fact that I wish I could change
err when she want to move ah because the house is bought
but she needs to move out by end of the year I think
eh no no she needs to move out by next she needs to
move out by next year june or march
showed me and mum the other day when I was at her house
because nobody loves you
just want to put it out there
ya anyway um
we brought madrina in the conversation
err what's the word ah uh
or maybe that is a
going to move and she was telling me that whether to decide whether want to
she needs to renovate the house is about two months
I believe it should be may june
late may early june somewhere there
err a few days
after my birthday ya
to be honest she actually very lazy to like
like
couldn't freaking leave me alone then like I was trying to shake him off
can I come the next day
and that stuff
nazri
I can tell I can tell that you you
wow so deep
no definitely I'm going to keep you
as far away from shura and all my other female friends as possible
mm no even if I did right I wouldn't show you
are you sure you're not part of the you're sure you're
sure no one took photos video of you showering
mm mm maybe maybe the
has like more freedom
is the liberal one is the consecutive
you need to be part of their like or some major then they will like let you
my god
oh my god reminds me of the remember when um
running man was super big and then running man running man
okay so basically this running man right is this like korean show or
where
a bunch of celebrities they get their they have a name tag at the back of their T-shirt so
so after that um
we noticed there was a lot of err people
we have a lot of like these young people running around singapore in with like their names on their back of their T-shirt
so you'll see like
jia hui jia xing eldrick elway like just running around like
in the station in one in one like tribe damn funny
I remember um
so mister jamal he spent he actually spent a lot of his time right as a
trumpist I believe that's what they call themselves
like
trumpeter ah I have no idea lah that trumpet players ah like professional trumpet players
so he spent a lot of his time right like like going around the world lah like he told us that
err he was a very rare commodity
in japan in the early seventies eighties
because err back then they they didn't really see like people with darker skin and he was like brown lah
he was a he he had brown skin so when he went to japan right they were all like just touching his skin and he was like
then I remember he told us
okay you can say that ah
so I remember he was telling us that like
he used to perform in like bass in err chicago lah
so he would play the trumpet and then his
um his
friend would play the piano
so err I remember what I heard was that
when he from my senior lah who was at that time who's going to graduate already who was about sixteen seventeen sec five
he was telling me that mister jamal right when he first came down right to the
to the like band like
like what you call this ah
he was in those like baggy football T-shirts lah
so they how that's how everybody realised that
this guy must have some sort of
err the
like the ah because he was wearing those
err
football jerseys ah like those what cowboys ah patriots
okay I know that
jersey that is always worn by like
filipino people
true true
it reminds me of kasanaz I'm sure you remember kasanaz
so kasanaz's husband is an engineer and he I believe he's a very successful engineer ah to the point that
they live in singapore but by right kasanaz doesn't need to work
kasanaz is like apparently like got money kind of like girl lah but I believe the husband is those
chief engineer or something ah like the and he's been in singapore for quite a long time ah
like even before they met and got married
yes he is filipino
I've seen him
ya
kasanaz knock it down
I really miss all my friends at
did I tell you that wei xiang is still working at
and I got so annoyed
ya so I got so annoyed cause I'm just like wei xiang first of all right
you and me ah
ah both you and me right are both like poly graduates you know like
your whatever the score is right
somehow some way right we both probably can go to university lah
keep telling me that you don't want to go to uni then you want to work
like for the rest of your life then
he you're you're very smart you're very smart you're very smart you're bright
is really like quite
not doesn't make sense lah since you like you
somehow educated lah most of these are mostly the people who work there are mostly aunties ah who
who like couldn't like if they could they would want to work office jobs ah
and if you tell me that
if you tell me that you want to work your way into the err the office side right then I think you should there should be a way to get in lah
so ya lor
I believe he's just a cashier
mm
you know err he used to intern for supply chain for
first of all you are bright second of all you did pretty good
err so first of all you did pretty good
in school and like you were quite interested in it and then you you you intern for not a small company eh you intern for like a really
big
err
you intern for a really big like like
ya should be okay lah no it's not
I believe yes but I don't think you
you can buy because I believe is a blue what do you call it a blue chip ah
cost everything I don't think is
you can easily buy also ah
they might be like you might be you have be invited to buy cause I think
like for example temasek right temasek holdings singapore
you can buy their bonds and all this but you have to be invited
I believe so that was what my teachers to me so I remember
my finance err teacher in school right and in poly right
we know that she's rich right because she told us that she has bonds with temasek then we were like bonds ah
you know shares right you can buy like hundred ah
yes so it's really like you need to have money ah
ya
you just it is really not nice to see that you are wasting away lah but
it's a bit sad lah like then your parents how
then I remember when we were in secondary school right his
he got an endowment I believe it's called an endowment plan lah the one where you
pay every month a certain amount and then you get a certain cashback at the end of like twenty five years ah I have one lah
but recently is I'm paying with it with my own money mah and I believe he's still probably getting his
from his parents ah cause how much could you possibly earn from
to be honest
quite sad lah quite sad so and then I'm just like
and the way like he lives his lifestyle also
cannot understand
I remember like the he keeps eating at
he keeps buying like a lot of designer goods
he the other day I remember he I think he booked a room at like or what lah those hotels to celebrate
his birthday or whatever lah so I'm just like
why
the I remember it's quite insane lah like the his boyfriend used to
use him as some sort of like card like that you know
ya they are gay actually technically but you know that's not the issue lah
issue is that
the the issue is that
and did I tell you that he he has a debit card then he gave his boyfriend his nets card
so there will be the boyfriend need money can just take I'm just like what kind of insane
ya
ya it's just that the guy handsome ah
I think he I remember he was
so this is quite funny so I remember last time
err
wei xiang was quite a
like not say an advocate lah he was quite a
this at this
restaurant at this then wei xiang didn't want to go and eat there
yes
it's not like called a jack's it's a by the way jack's place there it exists uh near the library
yes
ya so he say he didn't want because he just like
you want to eat meh with all these like
kids running around then I'm like dude that is so mean it's not like they're going to burst into the restaurant and disturb you you know
no lah so like remember he didn't want to eat there
cause he was uh didn't want to like be near this like be near students
so then lo and behold his next boyfriend is an student
yup so I remember the uh boyfriend was studying ah architecture or something ah
and then the boyfriend he's err
he's got money lah he's rich I forgot what the father does ah
err the father quite strict with the money ah
like I remember the father once said that
err got one time he slept in and then he on the aircon until like after ten lah then the father got so pissed the father said
err
since you on the aircon after ten right err ah your allowance is cut in half
to pay back for the time then the the son in like what the fuck it's like
I'm sleeping
I'm sleeping I I slept in like I don't have the power to like
wake up and off it then I remember like got so pissed off the parents were cause he and the
the father and the mother
um divorce so the mother is indonesian chinese
I think the father
like care more about his like his like half siblings ah
I don't know
I don't know lah
no I don't think that that is what happened
but anyway so wah talking about how ridiculous this is so I remember
whenever these two idiots right go on holiday right for some weird reason they always go jakarta one
second thing right they always go jakarta on like
business then I'm just like
you go to on business class right
you should go for long flights because
jakarta right to me is two two hour three hour flight is not bad because it's just
you are just crammed right for two hours three hours and most of the time you can be sleeping
I'm like have you ever flew to freaking like
dubai or like london or not
that is a six hour crammed flight right where like I was so
so sleep deprived right that I lost my phone that was how bad it was
okay I'm pretty sure I got robbed
but yes
that's besides the point
yup I'm pretty sure I got robbed anyway
mm go and meet the mother
he still need the mother still ask the son for money wei xiang give the mother money
yes but you can put a number on stupidity and this is this is this is fifteen out of ten
it's over nine thousand
not all of them ah but some of them right really right you know you can't put
you you know words can't describe your your beauty right but numbers can lah one out of ten
that is not ethical that is anything but ethical
no lah you have to make sure that if you are Instagram model and you are like
showcasing any product you need to make sure that
first of all whatever you showcase is true whatever you say is true whatever benefits you say is true
you don't lead on any of your followers you don't prey on kids
don't be dee kosh
don't prey on kids
seriously dee kosh is like screwed he is like
screwed I told you right that he did actually go to come towards my friend right with an offer
err okay so basically I was having a convo with my friend whose mum is the baker
remember the lemon yogurt loaf
I did I bought muffins as well and brownies
okay so I remember I was talking to him about
I think about his nephew lah his sister gave birth so
he was telling me
no
listen to the story so after that
the I remember he was telling me eh raf want to want to hear something cool then I say what then he's like call me then I'm like
okay so I called lah then he was like oh my god do you know who just like
what proposition to me then I'm like who
freaking dee kosh then I'm like huh what you dee kosh wants you to model for him ah he's like no dee kosh wants to suck my then I'm like
eh wait wait wait wait wait eh you don't anyhow hor
then he show me the like the text lah so I was like
you're this guy is insane eh you want to like
you want to find these kind of services right
Instagram account like you first of all right you use another Instagram account
and to be honest
your selling point right should not be
your selling point right should not be the fact that
hi I am dee kosh your selling point should be hi I have money
he did both he used both
so basically like he what he does right is that he will always be like oh you look hot or whatever want to come with me on my videos or not
that is his first proposition
yes so after that um
like then later on he'll be like oh like err
how about this like spend a night with me like I give you one thousand dollars or two thousand dollars or whatever amount of dollars lah
no obviously I don't know dee kosh I'm telling my friend that
no so um I was telling my friend that in the
in the like gay world right
like this kind of thing is normal lah hooking up and everything is normal but
you don't stupid lah there are apps and all these mah
as in like there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being lesbian
all these kind of thing anything that as long as you
you don't hurt anybody you keep it to yourself don't go and attack all these lah cause like
to me right all these
like people taking photos of like guys taking photos of guys showering right that is like you're harming people mah like
no one agreed to this ah and like you know
you shouldn't be doing this ah so this is the
part of like
like you know how people say there's like white privilege
so sometimes people say there is
in a sense right I won't say this is gay privilege but I see that like sometimes people are very
like
they don't want to be seen as homophobic it's the same as
how like people don't want to talk about like how
like sometimes like
women right are actually the ones who victimise people in so called rape cases
it's the same as uh you know johnny depp's ex-wife or ex-girlfriend amber something
a'ah the one that I believe cut off his finger or something
don't know but I think he cut off his finger or something
or cut his finger or something the one that she's now married to
that Tesla guy right I think
elon musk
ya so as in like
and the worst part is right like what the sushi guy said ah is like it's okay to
preposition people
preposition people for and using money right is is illegal lah you can't like solicit sex for cash lah I believe
that is
wrong lah like that kind of prostitution thing is wrong lah I don't know how how wrong it is lah in singapore
but he was propositioning minors you see
then he should need to what's the due err not due I don't think I think it's called due diligence to
find out whether the person is of the correct age or not lah
I don't know right is not a good enough um
answer to to evict you from like err
like
a a sentence ah it's like that there was this guy who
to give somebody to pass off something then
someone err he actually got caught in the singapore terminal
err with drugs ah that he was supposed to pass off to somebody
and then he's he did tell the the the judge lah he say I didn't know what's inside
these all locked up already I never open it I can't open it also
then the judge says that
just because you don't know what is it right you never think it's suspicious meh for
four thousand someone ask you to do a delivery for four thousand dollars
it's err it's not a good enough err like what you call it
defence ah the guy got the guy got hanged anyway
he the guy never say or whatever right ah
make the initiative to ask or if the person lied to you right then
then is different if the person lied to you will be like ya ya I'm actually eighteen but he's not
and then
err lied to you and you're eighteen and there was no payment involved and then you guys had sexual intercourse then
it's fine lah like the person cannot say because the person lied mah
and the person tricked you into it but dee kosh I think he
fairly knows I'm pretty sure from photos you can kind of tell
that these guys are probably under aged or if they're like
if you've seen like they're if you follow them on Instagram and then you see that oh I'm still in poly they still post poly photos
there's a high chance they're not even eighteen yet
cause poly year one poly you're seventeen only mah
okay the thing is right empower him right
in the sense that
we we
not me exactly lah but like people like
influence ah
ya
who
ya you can you ya as long as you
as long as you no it's john lennon
ya so like in a sense that
okay first of all these guys are social media influencers if you want to make it like like more
more specific lah social media influences ah
to
follow a a type of lifestyle
to buy a certain product mostly is to follow a certain lifestyle lah
that's between the followers and them ah some people will like ah it's the same reason why
you like guitars and I don't understand why and I
I quite like and ah you're not that big a fan of it
so
as in I won't say we empower him
in a sense because
what we do is that we we we give him
monetary
like we give him we support him in terms of monetary sense ah like you know by by giving like watching his videos and then people go and
like advertise on his channel and all this lah but we don't empower him to do the things he do mah
if you ask me who empowers him to do the things he do then is things like Instagram ah Instagram empowers him lah Instagram like
gives him the ability to do all these kind of things ah
nicole choo
yes
there are people your age who do it also you are just one of those people who are not in the trend
you're retard
anyway ya that's besides the point so like
it's just the way the world is ah the world evolves in this way lah so this is why I always find that
people who always complain right about all these and all these right have to understand that
everything happens right as is is everything is acquisition lah everything like happens because something happens mah
so like it's just evolution lah like something ee the previous generation must have done right has created this lah
so
like I remember I was watching the documentary about paris hilton
then paris hilton says that she is people say that she was the first influencer
and her responses her response to that was
I regret it lah I feel like I created monsters
which is true lah I remember she was the first
real socialite lah because before kardashian there was her what
she was the she was the real like
she her her her parents are freaking rich
her her grand daddy great grandfather is like rich eh like really really rich they got a lot of like money
and like she was literally a socialite ah she's like those
rothschild
like what
legendary families ah like how many legendary families are there left in this world
rockefeller rothschild hilton
um
uh can't really think of any other people like right now lah but
and all of course all your shakes ah
how do I put it lah like she is
influencer game thing I think there's nothing
there's nothing wrong with it lah it's just it's just
who are who are we right sometimes ah to tell people like what they're doing is wrong lah if if
if
there is no
like nothing really wrong about it lah like to be honest
don't there isn't there guitar influencers also I'm pretty sure there's guitar influencers people that
you know that if they were to review this guitar right that like tomorrow right there will be at least fifty people wanting to buy it
or place an order
it's just the content
that you you don't like which is like everybody's taste lah I personally don't like any of these people lah like to me my
I will always be like if there was a foodie influencer will be like oh there's this thing that just opened nearby in singapore like pancakes or whatever then I'll be like no lah I mean if I'm
err I'll go down to town and buy it lah if I think that the price is worth or anything but not a big fan of like all these
what challenges lah what I put inside my bag lah my house
tour lah how much money is in my bank lah my mother underwear what colour lah
like there's no need for you to advertise your life so don't you think like
in a sense right is this isn't a phenomenon that just occurred you know this
trend right exist in people right throughout the ages
people who
they're bored they have nothing better to do they just want
to some people they just want to really they just want to share their
their lives lah they just really want to share with people and some people might be
very interested like
I would say that if I have a interest in err
in a certain like celebrity or something like
would I be interested in
life eh when he on a day that he has fights
the fighters and stuff like that
or he calls or like you know like what is it that day in the life of like
err
an person or something like this kind of thing wouldn't you want to know
like what is the what is the prep like for a person before he goes on a mission
how do you how do you
measure productive right
in in in in in like in accordance to
like how useful it is ah it's content
I have no idea I've never I've never watched his videos
they have the power of
humour humour and story telling ah
no lah the target market is people from like
twelve to eighteen

because you you cannot pay off your debts like at your wit's end like you lost hope everything
ya lah then like if that's the sin then you take people life you take your own life then if the people want to live how
ya lah then how to bribe

unusual superpowers wah I've always wanted to try to be invisible because I think when I be invisible right I can like go anywhere I don't have to pay for my bus fare I don't have to pay for my ticket fare then I can do whatever I want so I can like eat
I just go inside I sit down and then I enjoy the ride and then people pay seventy dollar
then I pay nothing so I think ya lah that's that's what I want to
that's a very cool superpower
what do you think I am thinking of right now
it's always about food I think uh the reading about minds one sometimes uh I think it's cool but I'm also scared about it because like what if I find out something that's
I'm not supposed to find out
ya ask me
of course no problem
the one thing that I wish was free is um
actually why one thing ah why cannot be many things I say education ya
sanitation which is clean clean toilets
colours and so many different smells so like
it's so
basic clean toilets and then like so I cannot imagine how different countries
if we were to stop ourselves from going toilet because it's so disgusting and then in the end we become gross you know ya what about you what do you think what what do you one thing you wish was free
yes
oh if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
we need to keep working to get money because we also need to have bills to pay we want to buy stuff and then what if you want to enjoy so that you want to travel also you still need money so this is another loop
so I guess the one thing that everybody would want is just to take a break
you know just to be ourselves just to enjoy life so that's one thing I think that uh people would definitely be doing if we didn't have to work ya
what do you think like like what do you think about vacations and all that what would be your ideal vacation
eh then they make friend blah blah blah so that's actually how she expand she expand and expand the network so it's quite interesting to see like oh it's through these hobbies we you know when you just doing your own thing you just enjoying and then people see you having fun and then they also want to have fun right
wah so nice and like she she she's I I like to see her having fun lah
ya what what about you like hobbies what kind of hobbies you want to try what kind of hobbies you wanna like wah how come hobbies that didn't work out what kind of hobbies do you enjoy now
say if I were to play like music or like uh art right I have to practise so I really enjoy practising music because it's like really fun ya what what do you think about practising do you think it's fun or do you think it's like annoying
ya it's true oh then I wanna ask um
mm
think for me mm
four episodes ya and then err the way they shot it also like the beach I mean everybody loves the beach it looks so beautiful and then they play this song also so it's also memorable
to this place
for me I really love concerts leh like it's too bad lah this year cannot go concerts but I think that's okay because I get to save money right
uh then like mm
for me kan my uh
a higher price
ya lah so like for me uh
as a frequent concert goer kan you always hear stories of people who
sell tickets at a higher price so it was quite surprising that oh my goodness I am standing in a line and then in front of me is the person who does this you know because all this time you read online and then suddenly you see the person in front of you it's like
think for me my fashion style I always like to uh dress up I like to experiment since I was a kid so I always like try to go for like maybe but my normal life would be say smart casual then maybe I would like to try streetwear
and then uh if you look at my closet I like to have outerwears because it's so easy you just layer on and then you go it's finish
ya and err I I like to wear navy blue what about you what what kind of colours you like to wear
I don't believe in love at first sight ya that's why I ask you I wanted to know your opinion ya because for me kan uh
cause for me right my crushes are usually on like after I know the person after I know their character after
so like err personally I've never fallen in love at first sight and I think it's
ya what is it
I think this one eh your hardest question eh how can you ask me to eat one dish for the rest of my life how can like that
about this the the one dish for the rest of your life then what about like um say if you want to move to a country to stay for the rest of your life where would it be
for me uh just now you mentioned korea right you say you really like the the place all that down to the culture
oh I was thinking
mm korea I think okay but like
I want to say the language is a barrier ya but sometimes it's the food also
ya
I had a
not a very nice experience when I was at the airport because
so then I didn't eat for like dinner and then I was at the airport and there was no halal food I mean there's halal food but you see their airport is
chey cause taiwan
was the transit ya and then that's where the food on the plane lah so I the so these are the things that I think about when I want to think about living in the country
it's simple as food as simple as uh language culture culture I feel like you can adapt to it ya I don't know I don't think there's a country for me that I wanna stay forever I think I like to jump around
like eh quite cool leh like oh and then like uh ya I like
to actually I like to listen to the leaves and the meet in the wind
what about you is there are there any favourite sounds you have
oh that's cool ya flowers really makes me happy also I I don't think I have a favourite flower lah but I I love looking at like baby breath tiny flowers it's like something small it's not about the size but
especially when they're small and then like daisies also ya you remember the daisies that we saw at coney island right wah they were so cool
ya
very cool and like um
so like what kind of flower like do you wish you can plant
ya
so it's very cool to see um err what is this the flower moving
in the wind and then err
so ya lah I really like flowers I also like plant I like nature we all like to relax right it's so cool

friends lah I I know it's important but then uh friends that can can I think I mean can really together sit with you uh uh I mean like you can share things together
oh yes uh I'm more like want to have a peace of mind lah just want to have a peace of mind that that that I think uh because uh we have been through a lot you know for the past year
you know we have been like rushing through things so I now I think this uh the ten years time is to whereby I would like uh you know um
um
relax myself there is no rushing to settle down
ah ah ah like for you how
there will be new one I let go
um
mm
mm mm
mm
so meaning that ah
that means if in ten years time you will be thirty lah so at that age you
you still want to like uh you know pursue your interest
uh in science
okay
mm mm
okay
uh if there was a drama kan um I mean I like to watch action movie lah actually
ya cause action movie
working but then you you
you really like um awake that means you're really awake and you are like uh
you are you are really amazed you know amazed
ya stimulated and you are really amazed by their their skills lah
ah
yes correct uh correct
scenario settings uh you know once in a while okay lah once in a while ya
how about you
what kind of uh genre did you like to watch
oh
mm
mm
mm mm
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay okay
mmhmm mm
mmhmm
how come got become an actor choose body or looks
if I become an actor no lah that one is different question
mmhmm
uh I think fit body lah better rather than good looks I mean I no doubt good looks is important but then fit body is actually got to do with stamina because if your body is fit meaning that you have a better stamina uh you see if you are talking okay I mean not only about actors lah okay I mean like everyday life also lah we are talking about everyday life
I mean fit body is most is the most important
you know you don't feel lethargic easily you don't feel tired easily you see
so you are always active but imagine that if you don't have a fit body only good looks
right I mean what can you do I mean
what can you do you know I mean fit body is the the most important lah
yes correct correct
ya correct of course um of course we want both we want fit body and good looks you know because usually people say that if you have a fit body you have a good looks uh you know ah people say you have it's naturally
it is naturally lah like that
so what will you think
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
ya
ya so you see eh like nowadays generation you can see the different generation eh how they are very um they spend a lot you know to buy makeup for their own looks
but then they they they always ah you know
that is only external but not internal you see ah this is what they they forgot lah so I think um
mm
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm okay because I think about mental health ah it has to be
uh
ah that any friends that you think that uh that support you and any friends that you that uh you know can give you advice to go to that type of friends you you cannot keep to yourself lah whatever so that it doesn't when you have a problem you don't bottle up
ah at least at least you have uh somebody to help you on how to solve the your problem
you long stem from under you know really overwhelming
mmhmm mmhmm
ah
mm
mmhmm
correct
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm mm mm
mmhmm mm mm
mmhmm mm
mmhmm mm mm
I think ya it's true it's true I think that um okay when you talking about the schools eh um
not everybody can actually cope okay cause human being ah they they have their own limitations okay their their own limitations
can take the stress so you cannot push them further lah
ah because ah
correct
correct
correct
ya
correct correct
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
ya lah ya lah
ya lah ya lah ya lah
where would I want to go
mm
children days are really a a days that memorable days lah I mean
I I know that it maybe may be sound like uh like not not many people maybe not many people also have that memories children you know fond memories of uh like childhood memories lah childhood fond memories but like as for me
uh as a kid ah ya like work studies stress like so much you you know you eat you sleep ah that's it play around that's it of course always scolding from the parents but after that you find that
ya but
ya correct but I know that not everybody lah have their own good childhood memories
so how about you
oh okay
mm
mm
the theme
within a floor think you can it you mention long term
mmhmm
um
yes
it will do money like you know let me near grew from a nuclear war they're gonna company I think it'll be grateful
mm
mm
uh three wishes eh
um okay
okay the first wish that I can think of is uh
a healthy life lah
ya I I just want to have a good healthy life
and then um
people oriented ya I cannot see people especially children eh when they are in need children in hunger ah you see at some countries right where they are being left like you know in in a war by their parents
dead and all that so I think um a bit sensitive to their situation
okay then the third one the third one the third one uh the third one
what is it ah third one ah
mm
like for me right I think the other wish is that mm
but um
you you you you always want to see that your child is also healthy lah healthy body and healthy mind
uh and then the the best part is uh good behaviour because I think there is no point if I wish that my children to be successful in life
but then they do not have a good uh behaviour they do not know how to respect old people they do not know how to
um respect others
uh yes then um the their they do not have the love you know or compassion or what towards each other you know so the the behaviour that value is the most important lah
uh to me I mean there's no point they succeed in their life but then
I I just hope lah that my children are not like that and then uh I just hope that whatever that my children do they must uh always think that life is really temporary
uh in this tough life it's it's all temporary there is there um
ah that is my my wishes lah I I think for my for my children
for my children
mm
yes correct no I mean uh of course when you have money and all that people don't look down on you
I mean ya bad reputation and
correct
yes yes good nature correct
ya
yes yes yes yes correct
ah you see
ya no
mm
mm
okay
mm
ya
ya
there is uh good and bad lah we are talking okay let let us you know talking about phone first eh
see ah there there is a good and bad lah when talking about phones okay uh cause when the good part is that
the the information is at your fingertips
ah you know nowadays try you want to find like okay eateries okay you just google google and see you get eateries
you know it's it's it's it's very it's very easy lah and everything information at the fingertips but
this is what we are afraid of that they get hooked into it and then after that they forget about other things they forgot about doing things you see like nowadays
the I mean it's difficult lah to control it is more I think challenging
ah now you know for the parents of the now the the younger generation cause they need to foresee them they need to control ah you know their children so it's I think it's not really easy lah it's not really easy
mm it's not really easy
you know maybe you got for you it's got an educational purpose now
mm
ya correct
mm
cause because I think everything is being programmed in the
ah so that means like they only know and they only create this based on what is being programmed
um you see
ya I mean mean of of course
mm
mm ah ah then after that
ya
ya
wah I think ah I think with this right people will have develop more mental health problem

it's a different history and everything lah
different background
ya ya ya
mmhmm but it was interesting also to to experience that and sort of see the different variations I guess on the culture
is it prata
ya
uh huh uh huh
ya ya ya
wow
oh my god bo-kaap okay ya
uh huh
what does it look like
is it like a pani is it like

loaded in every ways
ah
ya
did we keep it for another day I feel like ya
oh gosh

LOL
ya
ya
ya ya ya
ya ya that was too much for me cause ya
I remember eventually I was picking it apart like
ya ya
ya
ya ya ya
yes yes cause they couldn't
ya
ya
and that that was really what it felt like what if if anyone out there wants to know how it tastes it's rich
uh huh uh huh ya ya
ah ya the gatsby ya that's what it's called ya
gosh
we ate a lot of ya
yes
feel like that whole trip was a it was a whole lot of trial and error and just pure excitement on our part but at the end of the day it was a it was a great experience
we didn't do anything stupid that's the good thing
I mean it we did a lot of stupid things but nothing regrettable okay you know nothing like I go back and I'm like oh what did I do you know it was just oh we did a lot of weird stuff I guess
oh shit that was stupid
ah
a'ah
mmhmm
a'ah
we are
ya ya ya
yup
mm
brain not functioning
mmhmm
yes
yes
forgot man
oh okay okay
ya ya ya
it was a bit weird but okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm mm mm
mmhmm
a'ah
a'ah
a'ah
mmhmm
mm mm mm
a'ah
ah
ah
it it was still a nice view nonetheless
yes
yes
you know right
oh it is how it feels like if you live next to mountain and you just go up and down the mountain everyday like
like how I go bukit timah hill and I see all these random people run and run but actually they live next door right
ah
it was it was quite challenging sometimes
ya some parts we had to go down on all four do you remember there were like ladders and whatnot
yes
ah
yes there there was five three G or four G I remember
ya
ya
mmhmm
yes
we
ah
it wasn't that bad I felt like the whole experience felt very
good like surreal
ya
ah a'ah
oh
cause we were we were going around in circles like you know a hill and then naturally
eventually there's like one part where okay one part
the thing about cape town in terms of geographically is very interesting one side of the hill you are near the ocean the other side you are near the city
so when we were at the end that's near to the city it was quite hot
kan that was an experience friend
mm
lion uh huh
a'ah
ya
ya ya but they they were had like the the bike gear on and
ah I remember when we got down the first thing we did was get a drink right do you remember
ya
wah
ya we went quite ya damn early
mm mm
and then I remember technically we had time to explore but we were so tired
ya for one two hours then eventually we went out just to have a walkabout
ya
that was quite fun though
that was very fun
the the goal isn't there and then like sometimes I read up about cape town people talk about signal hill and I'm like
oh we haven't went
cause I I like
feel like we didn't accomplish that
okay sure I feel like we are
two zero
gosh
with a whole new list
like the other day I was talking to her her name is amisyah and she's like I was like amisyah I really feel that we go somewhere it's for you ya I feel like you will enjoy it as much as I think and then she's like I did thought about it and I feel like I belong
and I'm like okay put it in the to-do list okay
before we die
yes
but my my friend has a stable job so it's just me lah which is fine
huh
oh wah that was really an experience man
I was telling her about how you how we had one day specifically just to visit all the mosques
yes
I'm like natasha we will visit all the mosques
okay no ya I know as in
I was completely I don't mind it's just like I just telling her
eh do you know or not I actually visit the mosques one by one that was like the most holiest thing I've ever done in my life
I think
oh gosh
ya it was also quite near to one another ya
ya
ya and I feel like during the experience err
while walking we also sort of explored the region a lot yes I felt I felt it was a good tour
yes
like I felt there was also another another good experience though ah ya
ya we did walking tour
we backed out
ya cause we felt like we didn't we feel like what ah I feel like the guy did
did a lot of stuff it's just that I could have gotten information online
it wasn't I feel like I wasn't it wasn't adding value to my things I've already read up on the usual so ya
oh gosh I don't remember mm
ya
oh gosh that was a lot of experience
food wise in terms of like which part the safari
ya
three weeks it was like three weeks but the three weeks we felt like packed so much information didn't feel like three weeks we felt like more than
ya it felt so long
a'ah
uh
ya
ya and then ya and then the weekend trip the the field trip is like forever you know they tell you we going on a field trip
takes like three hours to get there it was it's a completely different town
that kind of thing cause it's a big country but ya
ya ya
the field trip is like it's like hi we're going to the beach then like in singapore if I say to that you think of like east coast park over over there is like we're going to the beach and there are
actual penguins at the beach
like it was whole new thing
that ya
like I feel like whoever planned that whole school summer program really deserve a raise man
yes yes but I feel like it was money well-spent
american ya
ya ya ya ya
a'ah a'ah a'ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
yes
ya
ya ya ya
ya
a lot of seafood lah I remember seafood
ya
ya we were at the coast a lot I remember one time there was a there was the ostrich
that ostrich
farm okay we were at the ostrich farm okay so we knew very well that the ostrich came from breeding purposes like it wasn't a random ostrich shop down the road kind of thing
you know ya
yes
ya
but ya and then we had what else
a'ah
mm
I don't okay not puberty you know when you're eighteen you do a lot of stupid shit it's like that ya like like that part where you
think that you are mature but you are not actually mature you know
ya ya ya
ya
different school but we can trust them cause same land
yes
mm
mmhmm
yes
mm mm mm
yes
mmhmm
ah
ah ya avoid like we try to keep a distance ya
to spend time with him especially for activities that he need to pair up
a good trip for everyone and I feel like that was that was a good move on all our parts you know
cause I feel like even though the boy like
I mean
ya it's a bit questionable but I mean whatever lah ah after that we didn't keep in touch so whatever
it's okay we we did our part we did our our community service for the day community service
I feel like
I feel like we did good you know
like it's like eh
it's like it's a it's a good looking back wow matured
are you serious
but ya that was a really really fun trip I feel
mmhmm
oh gosh the kayaking
ya I remember I was I was really genuinely scared for my life
like I I really could have a panic attack if he just
uh gosh ya
um
the cave
the cave
your favourite
is it what you talk
uh huh
ya ya ya
ya
you guess that
ya ya ya
god damn it
hais
a time to be alive
what else did we do over there
I feel like okay I feel like
the trip was was a fun trip lah if I had to look back at the things that I've uh did in life I feel like that that will be one of my highlights
yes the highlight reel
before right before I die right
this is what you did
yes that's exactly
us getting stuck in the you and your getting stuck in the cave and all that right
gosh
that was an experience
okay
then what else
ya let's see another prompt
I want to learn how to draw
ya
ya I want to draw
cause I can't draw
it's a certain skill lah that's already been presented to me a certain level of expectations of how an artist
should draw or the kind of level they should achieve which I can tell I am not at that level ah
so there's that so instead of a drawing I resort to colouring
I resort ya cause I I do like
err art in general so I'm like since I can't draw
then I'll just fill in the colours for them you know it's it's so
an artist right it it does gives me a pride and joy and happiness
ya yes
and I I feel like it also trains my uh colouring skills
cause that's also uh colour coordination is a very important skill
ya I mean for a wardrobe purposes
so ya
I think for me would be drawing
mmhmm
what about you
just one ah
can
oh wow
yes that's the way
okay
I ah I feel
I feel like the fact that it's on the you know ice it's a bit tricky
and different
okay
wow
a'ah
oh wow
kind of what
okay
uh huh ah
ya it will
mmhmm
mmhmm
uh yes
did they die
oh gosh
okay ya
ya will be fun
so uh what else
two more skills
for me um other than drawing
mm
I cannot swim and the other day I went to this this park with my friend and it was
it was at lakeside I was at lakeside
with my friend
and then I and then I remember ah my dear friend wen xing were walking at this
so I think she she she no no no she stepped on this a creaky wooden bridge and she panicked a bit and she was like I really thought I was gonna fall and I'm like
oh shit if you fall I'm gonna fall also cause we are stepping on the same wooden creak eh and I'm like and the first person is gonna die is me cause I can't swim
it's really during those moments I realised that I should really pick up swimming lah ya
but I know how to swim a bit like I know how to float like I'm aware like there's a certain way of of making sure that you stay afloat in water and I I at least learn up to that point ah
so naturally the activity is just go
beach hopping I don't why I thought it's okay to be honest
I I didn't regret why I even but when you think wah it's like wow this girl really spend a lot of money to go krabi when she doesn't swim or kayak so
I went to krabi
with my friend it's just the two of us and I remember before going I already told my friend A I don't swim and B I'm not a water person like I'm the kind where I can in the water but five minutes later I'm like
I'm bored leave me alone I'm just gonna sit at one corner and my friend is like ya that's fine I'm also the kind where you don't have to entertain me I can have fun by myself she she really is the typical uh suntanning beach kind of girl
so I'm like okay okay so the trip is really we just in our own personal space like
like people who people don't know we went together you know it's really we are all both in our own personal space
trip and then like I remember she really was having the time of her life you know like she really down there chilling like there was even one point I told her eh I'm bored
I'm gonna go back to the hotel which is like fifteen minutes away from the beach
and then she's like okay great and then I went to the hotel I took a nap
okay I took a nap for hours I wake up this girl is still not back
so cause it's just the two of us I the sister part of me is like eh shit she got kidnapped I die sia
seven like she really just lie on the beach throughout that kind of thing then I just look at her and I'm like
okay can I didn't even know if I should go and say hi cause she was wearing a a sunglasses so I'm like I don't know if she's awake or she's not I don't know if she's gonna scold me ya I was like
you know I feel like I remember I played in the water again but five minutes later I'm bored
now what ya but ya I feel like uh if I could swim maybe I might I I I feel like definitely enjoy myself
I just feel like maybe I could have done more activities
ya
we didn't do we went the only water activity was the the beach hopping lah so
ya they just bring us to the beach and then they let us roam around for many hours
ya and A and B I don't find banana boat interesting
ya
have lah but ya I also like uh and then my friend was also uh
I I think don't have I don't remember but I remember we went kayaking but the kayaking was very scary cause it's like
initially I thought that the kayaking would be
a a group activity I thought there will be a guide but instead they just give us the kayak and they were like do whatever you want
yes so it's
no okay it was in the middle of the ocean A okay B in the middle of the ocean okay
it's like it's like you you know how in krabi there's a lot of islands so one of the islands we did kayaking and then err this island is a bit small so the idea was to circle the island that's what they told us to do but I remember looking at my friend not gonna circle this stupid island
and then she's like
nadi stop being a spoilsport let's try then I'm like fine so we try
we realised that we were in the ocean alone like I looked around I don't see people I was like eh shit this is like I'm in the ocean alone and I can die and then
that's where all my anxiety thoughts come out while my friend being the typical girl who loves beach tanning was legit taking out her phone and taking selfies
then I'm just like
her name is vishu
I'm like vishu we gonna die then she's like can you stop being dramatic and I'm just like
I feel like okay the thing I love about hanging out with vishu is I always tell people she's my number one hater I mean everytime I tell her my like all this problems she's like
shut up okay she legit she pushes me down there and then I don't know like I like remember cause she's an accountant so I will always complain about how I don't know how to calculate this money and she will just tell you're stupid I know that kind
so
this is our relationship it's really her telling me over oh I'm stupid and then I'm just like okay you're right I agree I am stupid
so throughout the whole trip I will just be panicking and she's down there eh no we are fine okay I'm not gonna die and then she and then I'm like okay but if I
if I drown then are you gonna save me and then she's like no
then she's like I thought you can take care of yourself
that's the thing okay so
I remember like I did panic a bit but eventually I managed to calm down and then we went we went to
uh the big shore
so there was this random beach in a thing and then we went to the shore and we chill for like
again five minutes
cause we we we after five minutes like I'm bored so we went back but I remember throughout the whole trip that whole kayaking I kept telling myself I'm not gonna do this ever again and that was really my last kayak up till now cause like in singapore
ah cause err
ya marina barrage ya ya and then
err I a few people have jio me I have one friend who has the actual kayak lessons so she has told me many times don't worry if you drown I I will save you
and then I looked at her face and I'm like thank you for you trying to act this is a superhero movie but it's okay
I will I will tap out of this korean drama moment
maybe I feel like the the swimming will help the the fear of the sea cause a lot of my problem is afraid of the sea but I feel like the fear of the sea stems from the fact that I can't swim
ya lah
ya ya ya
ya
always doing the bare minimum
always doing the
ya yes
more you already say live one another alone
ya ya wah I I really want to go okay I
I I think after the trip I went with her to vietnam to vietnam
I went vietnam when I went there right
she ya we went mountain wah that one was another one cause she cause I've known her for quite some time so she knows all my problems all my problems
and I remember I tell her confidently don't worry I can take care of myself sis
don't worry thank you for reminding me though
err I was very tired cause I have low blood sugar low blood pressure
so after if I don't have enough food after a certain time ah my blood pressure will dip and then I will faint
and then during that period
my dear my dear vishu looked at me and do you bring your sweets
and I said no
then she rolled her eyes and then I'm like I'm sorry for letting you down again
and then and then I remember on this trip it wasn't just the two of us she brought along two other friends her two other friends looked at us what's this tension what's going on
I like
but really it was like
don't worry nadi I got this I know you very well she took out she got protein bar and okay okay vishu is a fitness freak okay so her protein bar isn't like from seven eleven kind protein bar is those expensive shit kind of protein bar that you need to order online kind of thing
so she give me her protein bar then I like A her protein bar tastes great but B I like shit I I swear I ate her her expensive shit a part of me is like okay I am a burden so yes
but I remember that one trip is like everytime I need a sweet I just look at her like this
then she will take out from her bag and she will like roll her eyes and take out from her bag
I like sorry
but ya I remember ya in the end we reach the top and that was that was really interesting cause there was actually
A cable car up but obviously we didn't take the cable car okay and B I remember
mmhmm
but I remember that
it wasn't that long lah it was quite long also
ya but I remember at the top of the mountain there's a temple cause we're at vietnam and they believe err buddhist country most of them believe that
the higher you are to the sky the closer you are to heaven in thailand also I remember one of the mountains were like that but anyway
it it look like they you go google is like a hole big ass buddha statue at the top like it's like way big like it was a giant-sized kind of thing ya
but ya that was the only thing lah I was just like whoa
how did this work there was no cable car then
how
to the south of vietnam so after a few days we spent one or two days in one country then we will take a bus ride to the next eh not not country
and then I remember in the beginning it was ah there were four of us
halfway through the other two
her her friends had to go back to singapore cause ah they
they had other plans lah okay
ya
of everyone too unsure like should we do this should we not
a'ah
just like okay I feel like okay if you don't want to try then don't try lah like I don't know she will like says ah
and she will complain complain a bit a bit unsure eh maybe we don't do this maybe we don't do that I tell you like
like you can't based your experience your you know all your options on one person's experience that kind of thing so I remember feeling very like
like okay since you're uncomfortable then we won't do it lah cause of that we already have no options and to begin with we already had limitations in the first place
so it's a thing in their they are all accounting students so basically throughout the trip I didn't calculate anything it was my dream it was like suck at math like everyday I just look at look at my team of accountants like what's up guys so
I didn't remember ah ya so the boy like it was quite interesting though when we go on the trip cause they really like wah their calculations damn fast they look like they never speak they already can tell you okay this is not worth it they walk off I like what is going on but I trust all of you
then like okay oh I remember

ya and she's like okay on
ya but I remember I went where ah ya krabi and vietnam with her

other friend the other day another friend I was saying that we should go indonesia

who are like err rich as well
is there any
he can make it big you know
um um I mean
one thing tom holland is
one thing okay
he's young so he really suits it but I feel like I'm much more um what you call this thing convinced by the portrayal of toby maguire as spider man is very subjective a lot of people will be debating about this
but I just feel like at the point of time your teenager he was out there
there was this other person also andrew garfield you know
ya so um he his portrayal wasn't as good as toby maguire
like there's a lot of err
I don't know whether you understand what I'm saying but
I mean he does have the face of like
oh my god when was the last time
mulan
is it
think so
err acting ah
err I'm re-watching friends over and over again can never stop man
okay documentary
I know I heard
okay so in your own opinion do you think that that it's actually a good way of
um
mmhmm
personality personally I don't think it works though cause like okay one thing capitalism
um fridge
might not have the money to even buy groceries but in prison you have
good share though will be interested to actually watch it on netflix
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
they will be tempted ah ya should shoplift in norway
what do you mean
uh ya
oh right right right
nice
ya then after that this year
ya so ya what you buying what what are you buying planning to buy do you have any
things in your mind
um
insurance
mm
actually
ya but a vintage
is that is that like a trend right now because this is my first time hearing it
mmhmm
siak ah
oh
ah I see
mm
I mean it's it's still there
not being used I mean I don't know what to use it anyway so I'm planning to like get
ya
eh
uh um
eh
worth it seh
compared to sixty
cause all this while I been seeing like sixty-ish sixty six a seventy will be like the highest but since you say ninety like you think like I should buy now
ya no get go lower
oh oh okay I thought you mean selling
sell means good lah because it's ninety right ya so its a no go
you will not have to quarantine over there or when you come here you just have to do some swab test and you can just like
chao from there from the airport
ya negative ah
ya
huh
but there's no sun
hydro
are you serious
exotic
how how much is his
damn son
Shopee
when you say okay
hmm
I'm surprised
so what is he doing like apart from just selling plants
wow
product design
oh okay so how do you feel about that
and how do you feel about him taking a degree like
like
mmhmm
ya
I know girl
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh you went dark so fast
ya
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
sis we all struggling here ah
at least we are doing something about it right
ya and then like mine will be like birds chirping
ya
ya so like err ya so like now I'm like
as a wife or as a as it either wife or husband then you have to like remind each other to so like because if not then that would be you know your your your taiji lah basically so it's wife
we call it
where's your flaws may seems like whatever that might
what you call the thing
ya then that will be his fault
ya
ya
ya so this husband and wife thing it's it's really like teamwork
I really feel it after a year eh
being wife
communication that would be my response
communication is key definitely
because
like you assume that the other person will know
right so right you just have to communicate whether you like it or not whether it will hurt the person you can soften the blow yes but as long as you tell and communicate
and learn it the hard way
only when I met adam there I would I know the positiveness
the value of communicating
what do you mean
ya
ya
that was what I been saying
okay okay so yours is more of physical yours is more of like a err a tangible mine is
I would always say mine is intangible but mine is like
err
verbal understanding technically its intangible is more of like the vibe that you get from your husband or your wife
ya
boyish lah so I I didn't I I sometimes assume and I I I don't know what he wants ah so he have to communicate he's the girl in relationships basically lah
I think we both know that lah
ya so just tell me what you want lah so in a way communication works
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm
mm mmhmm
okay mm
mmhmm mmhmm
ya ya as long ah you communicate really because like if you think like you want to run away
ya
Tiktok
ya
there is there I mean there is one
oh damn
oh
muffin mitten oven mitten
is it the rainy day
its the rainy season
wow
oh my god I'm so annoyed with this trump and biden thing
cause like err back then like like few
ya and then like I have to like nudge him and say like you know like
communicate ah if you please wear the stupid earpiece please
I am the president
when he's he's not president
jer
okay
ah
uh on trump um surprisingly ah quite good looking guy
ya when he was like younger
ya
ya supposed to go to the office today cause every monday is a calling day so err but its raining so he I don't know whether he's gonna call at home I mean technically he can call at home its just that when you are at the office and everyone is calling you will be motivated to call right
so I don't know why they do calls on monday I mean mondays got monday blue as a customer as a client would you want to be called on monday for insurance like don't disturb me on monday monday is really lousy
ya but monday
wait he suppose to call you
orh
mm mm
ya
mmhmm
mm
ya
ya ya ya
oh okay
is it because it covers slightly more I don't know
oh
mm
mm
mm mm
orh okay
okay
but if you terminate
orh okay okay
oh
this is under adam or your own
I know that is doing very well right now so that's why he's trying to get like um all his clients to invest in sector because Apple is coming up lots of stuff um a lot of people will invest in that and
ah mmhmm
mmhmm
side
oh oh
oh
UNICEF ah
ah ah that's the one
what what was the question
did you google
initiate
how do you do
in your essays in secondary school
I know I know
think you should work on your timings
short form
funny though
sorry but um yes err in twenty twenty four by twenty twenty four all students will get a personalised laptop
yup
yup
so much girl
do you know about the new syllabus oh not syllabus like the new programme education program that we have right now
so basically err I'm not sure which year
so
will have their common test mid year and the year right
as of now they don't have such thing theory change
it's what we call with the assessment so they have three of them already four of them eh so they go by percentage okay some pop pop quiz pop project work
so they only have one major exam at the end of the year and that's really really high percentage which is seventy percent
that's it ah
so I do not know whether it's actually blessing in disguise for some people
a stress on kids which I don't know it kind of doesn't work lah
because I hear students say I stress
ya adulting
mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
ah
its its definitely different lah cause um
it it has its own pros and cons like for both the old system and new system because the old system you have lesser weeks to teach and you have more time not more time you let's say we should because you need to set papers and they have exams you have mid year their contents they have mid year and they have end of the year
this time around I only have one end of the year so technically teachers need to set one piece of the exam and the rest is just like activity and it can be like presentation it can be group work pair work whatever work so all of this it's in to
I don't know whether you actually understand where I'm coming from but um for me if you ask me which one I prefer
as a teacher
so it's much more stressful for them
but for teachers its just set papers
if you if you if the way that you set paper is very stressful then that's on you lah
but
for me is is still okay cause
ya
uh huh
a'ah
ah
ya then they will be screwed up ah which is very common in my class
ya especially COVID this year
um I'm coming later
okay the thing is like when we wake up as a form teachers you have to take attendance so they will have to be in this like zoom call or whatever and then like
err there will always be this one or two people who never wakes up
it's like
ya and its like
ugh its still retained there in my mind so annoying
ya and
um in a way yes because like I don't have to like teach and I can chill a bit but the fact that I still have to go to work and I cannot travel cause it's the only time that you can travel right end of year to travel to like europe country um
that's it ah december holidays
I don't think you got book no book
to to to do you have the link
um mac birthday is next month she's been wanting to go singapore flyer mac
no no no I mean you can use some of it so I check already so senior citizen is like thirty something
adult is fifty
there goes my fifty
can ah
right you should be able to stack though
ten ten dollar vouchers that accumulate to hundred ya
but fifty dollars for a ferris wheel
ya she's been wanting to
oh well
um

so hello I'm I'm went from the toilet ah sorry ah for the wait
so like
ya what what were you doing ah meanwhile
ya ya ya ya oh ya it's sedap mania oh cheap ah really got what flavors over there I feel like going there again tonight leh
oh
bestnya
oh ya adam I think most likely ah
he will be coming
ya ya most likely now he's taking a rest to to power charge himself for later
ya
ya
ya so
oh oh
oh ya ya ya true true true petrol in singapore nowadays very expensive lah
thailand
um ya so
I see I see
ah ya
ah
ya
adam needs more convincing to do lah
ya
err anyway
K
hmm
oh ya hor eh but then now that you say but then I I I just remember right that I saw one telegram that it says err um
have you heard of ah what chick chick shake shake tub
it's like chicken chicken and all
so one is for one dollar
we never go at there maybe we can go there lor check it out twelve dollar for twelve pieces wah shiok sia
actually we can two person share one what one person six piece six dollars okay sia right
ya so
satay sauce soup base I was like wah that's kind of cool then maybe we can
mm mm
oh
me ya
I I also don't know lah I I'm actually looking into the stock market also
so
hold a lot of shares tau so I think
be everything okay but then when you look at the screening process and they say actually cannot because in some sort they have like a subdivision debts investing in this like
but which is which might not be very halal link assets so
in that sense you know there's a lot of this kind of thingy
ya um
um
mm
I see I see
but how much ah the fees is it cheap to to put in money inside
mm
ya ya
new um way
so
so
right kan
that's true that's true
I I I think like the the notion of ethical investing is like getting more
gaining popularity lah because like you know um
eh not not sorry it's the international monetary fund right
they recently like two years back I think they they started to look at islamic finance and they are pushing forward lah for
that's why I think err
ya possibly because um even a lot of like muslim
people or other muslims they will still invest in
um maybe there's one thing we can consider lah
so ya
ya so
ya
so um
mm
okay um
I okay
I will try my very best to convince him to go
ya
there also the vibes like very nice you know
mee sua
ya I mean
ya worst come to worst me you adam
ya
ya
ya but the cheapest is two dollar per fifteen minutes
ya
ya
okay um
ya so
ah ya lah
um
so um
okay so we can review about I don't know
business ideas
huh
ya
ya
I don't know lah
oh oh your uncle was from there
so ya ya
ya so what did your uncle say though about about the block
it is it like your uncles or your friend like who is this person
oh okay okay
oh
oh
oh
but ya ya this mom is specialising in what kind of medicine ah
I I'm wondering uh honestly curious
oh interesting eh psychology
wah
very good very good I mean now nowadays they say you cannot specialized you need to generalize you know in your career
diversify kan
ya so maybe lah it's the it's the same person lah loves animal right
a lot of careers ya
so I feel like if your mom is the psychologist then your daughter cannot be like that you know
oh mother's gossip
uh maybe we should help lah we should help please tell
so um it's important lah to seek medical treatment I say I mean twenty twenty now mental health is very important
so ya
they're not stigmatized lah in
ah ya ya I I I redeem it I put it on nineteen as well which is this coming saturday lah
ah sentosa is it
that's how ah we've got twenty dollars worth of credits right
so um sentosa maybe we can
picnic
I don't know cycle
we can
sit at the bar ah
you know we can just hang around at sentosa sentosa I think we can go to the
deeper deeper parts lor
ah yes yes maybe we can go there also over the fort serapong can just cycle there I don't think it's very far
it's like within the
I'm not sure about the
whether it's legal or not
I would I would think these kind of place
they don't say lah they don't say illegal they don't say it's legal but then they will say if anything happens to you then
ya but I think we just be very careful like you want to visit all of these places and I think now because we are in lock down and all there's nothing much we can do so
I think you know the COVID and the circumstances has pushed us to you know venture
oh ya ya how much is it ah
I'm not too sure I really don't
oh ya we can do that also uh I think twenty dollar thing can get us about three right
err um can lah I mean
we we can go for the luge but luge is like
ya as in eh as in the the timing also lah
I anytime if some more if it's on a saturday then I think will be best if we go
can also lah because okay if you want right because we get about twenty dollars but do we have do we have to book on the tickets in advance
err let me see eh err
three rides one blue one orange one green thirty five dollars
I I don't quite understand
so many rides lah but I think it'll be different
madame tussauds
ya green zone so green zone and orange zone one ride is ten token
twenty err twenty token
okay um
hackett the jumping one right fifty five token
there is uh another one ah gogreen segway the segway it's only five token for
thirty minutes one hour ten token by pedal bicycle
ya I think it's okay ten token worth it one hour seh one hour we can it's a very long time lah not bad seh
ya don't have their have eco adventure but I don't think there is kayak
we can take cable car if you want cable car is twenty token
mount faber and sentosa and it's a round trip
so you can take it from mount faber
budding air
ya lah we can oh got mega adventure park um
ya so we ten ten so we get to take err two different attractions lah which I think a bit quite nice eh some more plus cable car then after that
ya eh what is mega bounce mega bounce
bike
aiya I guess not too sure but okay lah we can check there out we can check that out some more I mean we are not paying you know technically it's free so let's just do that
so I mean we we can see lah what else we want but I think to really maximise the segway is good because it's at whole one hour then I think
there will be a tour guide so then you can like literally explore a lot of places in sentosa just by the segway
ya so okay lah so nineteen nineteen so which is this sunday right this saturday right
err
it is the nearest station is tiong baru
and I am like wow not bad not bad not bad interesting
oh eleven to fifteen december
so ya segway so we segway for one hour
basic ah seh
ya original price eighty nine dollars
or one mega jump then
err actually we can do the also lah the is ten token
you know it's not bad ah usual price twenty two dollars
eh actually this one better if you want we should go for the sea aquarium tour ten token then the other ten we go mega bounce lor
ya more better than one hour jer
yup yup
ya bike got a lot of things lah then maybe you know sit somewhere carry marrybrown if you wanna
or marrybrown or or or we can just go ce la vi eat aspirasi mah

mm
my last trip was langkawi

I was only nineteen ah as in like flight flight kind
okay that's it for now

mmhmm
mmhmm
my wish ah
my wish
actually
ya
be a good children
then
that we work fishing prawn very very long time
mm ya
uh ya
I we went to many schools
schools and also
institute
uh then we find it
err
ya
the rent was very cheap just five dollars
per month yes
uh actually we can sell anything lah but except
except like we cannot sell deep fried items
uh
then we need to use less oil
and then we cannot sell junk food
like processed food
we cannot sell processed food like sausage and all those things
ya
um
we cannot
no wait we need to look out for local peoples to work there
yes
so I I have to find the locals lah to work there
ya so
if I take over
I need to learn cooking so it's not that
you know
overnight thing I need to
learn
ya
the the canteen sells malay food
muslim muslim
stall is a muslim stall
um
mostly is malay food like mee soto mee rebus
nasi lemak
so
mm
like quota like unique this stall need to be this kind of food
the other stall need to so this stall is basically for muslim malay food
ya
so uh
they need to standby there
it's the requirement the owner need to be there at all times at least one owner
so the the guy say
they don't have the time because they also need to look after other other business
then
belongs to them lah
ya
searching for the suitable space lah first
so everyday we are going out and finding if there is any
err good space to start small
ya
ya
my third wish
I would say everyone to be healthy
that's very important
ya
ya so
ya mm
because
I
we cannot do anything in life
everything will be very difficult and miserable
ya
ya
so in order to live a life we need
help
to the society good to the family
you know it's not there's just the kids
not just the children but also the
parents also need to be
nice to the children
you know
ya so it's best either you share everything lah
rather than you
just doing by yourself sometimes you get lost also
ah
ya
mm
ya
mm
so what I I can ask you
I ask you now what are your three wishes
ya
okay
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
meal
meal
oh
meal
mm my memorable meal
well
actually I cannot recall there were many
I think everyday we are repeating the whole food that it's nothing like very extraordinary
things that I had
no because I think it's a cycle we are repeating
you know we are keep having this um same food
to recall anything that
extra ordinary kind I think
mmhmm
smoked duck
uh
was it good
mm but I'm not a person who like to explore like you know the things that I didn't
err
I didn't had before like
I will only take the normal meat like chicken mutton or beef or fish
and then I'm not a
person who will go and try like
new kind of meat like duck meat or
other than
the meat I mentioned before
ya err but if it's like fruits and vegetables I'm okay to try
like salads
and all those things like cakes all I'm fine with that
ya but
ya
mm
he likes to go for hunting he has a
I don't know what it call the long one
sniper I think so yes
err I'm not very sure how it works
err
you know paddy field
not swan the the very
err slim as
the the tall bird
who who who who the bird likes to stand on one feet
huh
ya but it's not so big it's a small one
that one I tried before
when I was a small child I think
ya that meat was
so I don't have that
err courage
to try
mm um things like I don't know why
meat
ya
err travel you know you can start travelling
yes this one is my this one I'm not it's just now the bear talk it's I mean I mean what I say
yes
mm
um
for me
drama or film
is
is purely an entertainment
I don't mind it's fiction or non fiction
kind of story because
these things are purely for entertainment so you just got entertained that's the purpose of
the visual
right
so I'm okay with any
ya anything I'm I'm okay
ya so I like like
err
short film ah short film
even movie also
okay lah
movie
movie also okay
I'm I also like cartoons
but I like
err shrek
err rapunzel
frozen ya
ya
mm
I think I watch one
I like avatar
yes
really
mm
then I also like twilight
ya
yes
ya
but I like the
actually ah more than I don't know I don't remember exactly the story but more than that I like where it was shot like this was like inside a forest right
ya so I like the background
uh the songs
uh
storyline also
okay lah
ya
ya
huh
prepared to sit and watch but I I it's a a but I like to watch them
uh
I think the most um movie
ya
huh
tobey
ya
err the maybe it's because the first one I watched
mm
mm
ah
okay
uh huh
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
you mean err
professors doing part time
they have other jobs right
mm
mm
to meet your mentor
who who is your mentor is it a professor
okay
mm
mm
uh
so how do you find your course uh is it you liking it
you mean your your A level friends
mm
your your friends friends who are doing the same course you mean
mm
mm
ya
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
oh they have and all masters and all ah
you are of second approximate they all say something about how they send their students overseas for like
mm
mm
mm
teaching
then
um but the same time you will also have a job right
I mean beside teaching
then you wanna take it as full time
ya
eh
mm
mm
mm
me
ya
ya so
uh we are trying to find a suitable place do not want to jump
you know err take our time then
because now err when I study the market because of COVID
there's a lot of businesses are closing down
no business
so we need to be very careful when we invest
uh and not to invest too much
because we don't know what's the outcome
ya
like
it's all in the process
nothing eh
have
has my tedious life
mm
ya
so
what lah
mm
ya
free
oh there was err it's err healthcare
so like like terminally ill or critically ill uh and there is no choice but to get a treatment
also it's very uh
you know um
so let's
so that's going to
um make the recovery even
harder
ya so I wish
um
ah
ya I wish they get the best treatment also
eh common in what sense
you you mean the outpatient
ya
if not that
maybe we can afford
how we are going to afford
ya
mm
mm
master
oh okay
err is with is with a private coach
yio chu kang
yio chu kang or choa chu kang
ya I think yio chu kang or choa chu kang
mm ya
it's err four lessons
mm
mm four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coach is quite hands on lah
mm
err I mean uh two years before two years ago
it's very
meaning I mean very err
uh so I I I I think I need err more practice
but
I think with more practice I can master the skill lah but it will take time
for me
ya
like I feel like my body is like ache here ache ache there ache here you know
so I want
rather then I do I I I want to go for pilates
so it that one is actually not for weight loss
but is to correct your
posture
alignment to make it
correct your alignment something like that ya
active
is it with the equipment
pilates
ah
mm
is it good
just
err
just uh designed for pilates which will help you to correct your
postures more
so I feel rather than
um the normal pilates I think I
I do this pilates lah I want to try but I haven't signed for the classes
ya
because private ones I think is quite expensive
mm
mm
I mean the credit
uh
delta delta
delta swimming pool
so we need to
it's not we decide when we want but the coach will decide which pool
um I didn't learn anything from
practice
I can master the skills but not too fast for me
mm
yes
then will compete
so if you want again you need to pay
mmhmm
ya
one dish
mm
I like bread toast
no
but I like bread toast lah
I don't mind
but err only the downside is that
err because it's all carbohydrates so I don't think I can eat
but if you if you ask me
um
I would rather go for something with proteins
chicken
or fish
ya I can eat that
from
ya with some fruits and veggies
ya
uh
ya
fried rice
oh mee hoon tom yum
okay
ah
okay
so how was the rice today uh the mandi rice
the smoke is just like only on the surface
ya
curry
hmm
I like it very much the rice
for me it's like
one of the best um mandi rice I cooked so far
no I did before with the whole chicken
ya
no for me this was this this is more flavourful
than the previous one
mm
okay
mm
pizza hut
hey which pizza you ate ah
half half
half half you can order like that
is this the same price
mmhmm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm mm
err tomorrow bought probably will be
no
probably will be
chicken curry
ya why not and ghee rice is very simple to make
very easy to make
it's very easy lah
let's say you take err one cup of rice
any cups lah
I'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take um you can make it with the basmati rice
or you like the small small rice
okay you you measure one cup of rice
then you err if let's say one cup of rice uh you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of ghee
you put the ghee
then you slice like one medium size onion
um but the onion you should you should slice err very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy
so once it's like
err translucent like a bit brown then you put
err what is the name in english uh
so just one one will do one small piece of
then
ya that's all lah if you have
then you dah fry then you you take one cup of rice
put one and a half cup of
water then when it starts to boil you put
err according to your taste lah
then you cook lah rice cooker
ya
that's the simple version lah there's many kind of
instead of uh instead of
so what's that one and a half cup right
uh
then you put the rice
ah
ya
ya curry chicken lah the best with potatoes
mm
can
no oh it's it's
it's easy to make
you then you can try to make tomorrow
I already to
it's not that difficult you just need one
ah onion that's all then the rest

mm mm mm
for me ah mm

uh the hours are not very long for me I think it's not very hard also and the pay wise is okay for me also it's not very tiring also ya lah
uh that's for weekdays lah then weekends like I get like ten dollar per hour so I think it's okay
ya
but the hours like
mm mm mm
any complaints uh any any situations that happen that you can share
ah
ah
ah ah ah
ah ah
citing play any place that thesis my senior
mm mm mm mm
mm mm
you all
you all straight up ignored him or what sia
oh damn
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
suited switches waited until like someone call him to
mm mm mm mm
your max ah
ah ah ah ah
ya lor in my opinion also I feel like
ya
ah ah
ah ah ah ah uh huh uh huh uh huh
okay lah but if you're working in this sector you need to expect this kind of people also
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm
what parents
I mean I'm quite lucky lah right now they my my my tuition centre the parents are all quite okay not really those demanding ya they're all chill
but I mean I mean they're bound to face this kind of
bad parents also but I think overall is okay like
what I want I wouldn't complain anything about it lah everything is everything is gucci
ya ya
so what you're planning to do for your full time now
mm mm mm
ah
what kind of careers can you like get from this course though
freelance is it
oh cool okay
which
ah which company
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm mm oh ya but during your course of study got intern or not ah
so mm
is that related to your course though
ah ah
mm mm mm
your cup of tea
mm
ah mm mm mm mm
mm oh the standards is not very high there
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
words mmhmm
mm
doing mmhmm
but I feel like singapore these kind of things is not very exposed like media things going on so like a bit hard lah for you right
mm mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm understand understand
full time jobs and then as you were saying regarding like not what you want but more to survival yes
ya take whatever there is mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
culinary
mm
ya that's true
mm mm mm
uh huh
ya it's true mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
ah but from this situation also like a lot of thing was affected like we can't even like travel anymore or like go to concerts and stuff like that and I don't even know when will we
fun things like what
mm ya
mm oh ya all these are all affected
mm
and to see but the
how to sit and apple
ya
mentally physically
mm
mm mm mm
but also depends on each person lah because like some people are like you know they're the extroverts and
introverts but then the introverts will like appreciate this point of time because of like they all just have to like constantly stay home and not have to like meet other people
bad for us mostly to the extroverted side that one can affect us like a lot
err yes but I feel like I've changed honestly I mean I told people that I'm an extrovert but then like the other time I took the test like I've changed
I mean I'm still an extrovert but some factors changed so I mean I don't know if like it's possible for our personality to change like that
I don't know I feel like cannot wait so from what
you're still extroverted right
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
ya
mm
mm
like I feel I feel like as we age ah and then we find ourselves to like keep
we find to keep to ourselves more not as much as we did like last time when we were younger
ya sometimes it gets draining so we need like time for ourselves like for awhile maybe one or two days then after that we can go out again
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm ya I understand
mm hmm mm
mm mm mm
but right now I feel like we are slowly getting back to how we were last time though
like crowds are not so crowded but people are coming out more roads are getting slightly busier and stuff like that so I think
it's quite of a slow moving but we are still going back to our way lah but it's just slow
mm mm mm oh my god ya
everytime I see such videos I feel very blessed to be in singapore honestly but then like you know cannot put my guard down also cause we don't know what might happen anywhere
mm
mm our blessings
mm mm mm ya
ya ya ya
mm mm mm
so we have some parties who are willing to talk about the minorities right mm mm mm
a change lah
progress
mm mm mm
mm
close minded lah
mm mm mm
I think I uses an enormous
such matters
but I feel like when I go online I mean when I go online I see like people are quite vogue ah about all these matters but then come to come to think of it social media is most likely just like the youngsters
my our generation but then like still singapore is mostly made up of the older generation also who are still stuck in this kind of like mindset
so and then it's they make up most of the people in singapore I mean
overall then still singapore is still considered quite close minded and traditional lah due to some of their thinking those are their thinking
but then like you know I see social media all then like all the youngsters all that one is like
they quite okay quite woke but then like you know it's still just a small what percentage of singaporeans ya
mm mm
thinking
mm
mm
mm mm mm ya
mm mm
mm mm mm
but I'm glad that some of the percentage of the votings for the elections was also
made up of younger generations so that one actually like kind of assured me
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
what
ah flaws

you know what same girl

mindset

I mean I'm not really a porridge eater but this porridge is not bad ah
kind of one of the top one I mean not top but one of the good ones

oof god damn stop it girl we hungry
oh I don't know that one I'm not sure
anyway tell me about yourself like like how you from
from secondary school from primary school until poly like we met in poly correct
we met in poly and then I mean I didn't think we had a chance to get to know each other also
like we mostly met for like
ya for our tasks and things to do not at our own timing so like I think we can take this chance to like you know
anywhere you can start ah anywhere you can recall
wah sis you know my my memory sucks lah so
I don't know girl anywhere
mm
oh
ya so I announced it go you know okay ya such as
so how many years of floorball did you play
four years oh from sec one eh
wow
wow
mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm
how
mm
oh my god
mm I know I know I know
I keep it out they are used
mmhmm
oh my god
ah
ah
did it actually work
so what you bring it for your practices ah
uh huh
then
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
but in school you use the school stick ah
but for competitions do they provide sticks or
oh so in the end you still bought lah
class fund
oh eh ah
edusave eh
ah
mm mm mm mm mm
mm
so you prioritise the uh
mm
mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mm
so your for your school floorball was it an all girls or mixed
oh there's two floorball teams
mm
mm
oh so you improved a lot ah
mm mm mm mm
mm
mm
why though
looking be scared probably isn't it
ah
mm
mm
did they like dislike you
hatred ah oh acceptance from that
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm
mm
to join you lah
mm mm mm
for me I I tend to like you know get myself into like
this kind of things lah like if I see your personality is like something that would bring drama to my life I'll be like
okay I'll just like you know distance myself from you
so like for me drama is like really I don't really face dramas ah
ya like even okay the most I've ever had drama in my life was
poly but I it's not me it's like people in the class I wasn't involved at all the people was in the class
and then like they were talking about it I mean I hear people talk about it but I'm just like
okay you know like whatever let go I'm the type to like if you don't do shit to me then I'm okay with you ya
as long no matter what people say about you ah so as long as you treat me right then I'm okay lah so like I mean
that's how I feel like I came with like a no drama life ya
it's not even me drama is like my class drama you know that kind of thing
and then the class drama and then they all talk about it that's why I can got to know about it what
if people don't talk about it I don't think I will even know about it
mm
the floorball is it
mm
mm
mm
I think that's what happens when you put a lot of girls in one place
mm
mm mm mm
get through with it
uh huh ah ah ah ah
mm
mm
mm
oh so you guys were sort of like the junior team is it
mm
mm mm mm mm
oh math was the only one you failed
but
oh okay
mm mm mm mm mm
so neat
so did you like ever thought of like continuing your floorball things in poly
really I never hear sia
mm
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm
mm
mm mm mm mm
oh okay
life skill
I feel like sports is like you have to have a passion for it lah if not it's like really tiring for you
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm
oh floorball
that is going to affect your grade more sia
exams
oh my god O-level
mm
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
but I feel like sports also especially floorball in singapore it's not really a um
really
mm
mm
mm
really
mm
mm
mm
I mean it doesn't as someone who's not very involved in sports I I never hear like
I mean person as someone who's not very involved in sports I mean I never hear like
floorball before lah in singapore ah like a popular way
weird why
mm
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
ah oh ya
oh ya we had the camp
huh
really
vibes ah
mm mm
but I think we achieved quite
a lot lah from our time there
which one the flower
I don't remember sia
mm ya ya ya
I think for me I think I've a lot of ideas in my head ah but I think executing part ah
that one is not for me ah
that's true
mm
I feel like also like we all as organisers we have other commitments also
and then like it's not necessary we're not full on committed to this role of ours
and then I think that's one of our flaw lah
why ah
oh oh why though ah
why ah
oh ah ya ya ya
ya sia haiya
mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
tertiary is what secondary ah
oh primary secondary or poly ah
for me I think okay the most time I enjoyed will be
primary school but then the thing is like primary school I was like really young so I didn't have any like
secondary school wasn't really good for me poly also
poly was aite but I wouldn't say it's very good also
ya so I don't think my education was a kind of a fun time for me lah
so I would choose the primary school lah cause like it's the most
unproblematic ya
anyway let me tell you all about my school life
so for primary school right I was from ahmad ibrahim at yishun
so it was like a kind of fun thing because like you know like if you no money or what just go staff room
and then like but I was
in ahmad ibrahim for just three years like primary one to primary three
and then after that uh I moved to serangoon so I had to transfer myself so I went to pei hwa at sengkang
so that was when I had like
so eh no pei hwa was secondary school sorry I went to anchorgreen primary at sengkang
so that was where oh wait I haven't with you yet so I'm at ahmad ibrahim right I joined
err skipping rope skipping
and ya it's a rope skipping and I was unexpectedly amazing at it
like I was quite popular in primary school just for being like the top rope skipper
like I don't know why but like our sports day there is like even a rope skipping sector for it
like is like you either rope skip the fastest or like you like
run while skipping that kind and like
is and I always win first no matter what level is that
and like I don't know why like I found my talent there ah and then we joined like skipping competitions like
even though I was in primary three only I already knew how to like you know the double double skip that one and then like
as someone who's like super short is like quite unexpected for me to be good in this kind of sport lah
and then considering I did it although it was just three years I
thought I would grow but I never
but rope skipping is
jumping eh so I most of the time jumping but I don't know why I never grow lah
but anyway I managed to join in my three years there I managed to join one competition
which I don't really remember what how we did cause it was like really super long time but I remember like rope skipping in front of a lot of people
and then like
I was with like the seniors and shit and then like everyone was kind of tall there but I don't remember seeing locals it's most of the time like foreigners
but I think I did
I think I did quite a good position at the
the time for the fastest skipper ah that one
I think I got I think I did quite for that but I really don't remember how it went ah
ah I think so
I think so but I really forget sia I forget I just remember skipping super fast I was like
and then after that err okay that's all then my primary school was
err skipping lah then after that I went to anchorgreen sengkang
and then that's at sengkang and then there I joined dance
dance ya join and dance but I did chinese dance but surprisingly until now I still cannot do a split
ah
ah no we have three types of dances all
ah we have like modern dance we have chinese I don't know why but I was put into the chinese dance ya
and then there's like those things and stuff and so unexpectedly I didn't expect myself to be an okay dancer also so from primary school I got
an interest in dancing lah so that's when I like find out myself about dancing and stuff
so ya primary school was one of the most memorable ones one I would say
like no problems at all no dramas and shit and like everyone's just like
vibing so
ah ya lah those lah ya just for fun
really
from what like
just like interest uh huh
personally I feel free styling is like
hard sia for me
mm mm
because it's up to you also what right ya
okay
ah
err for me I don't know eh I feel like those
type of things you know there's like contemporary and shit for me I don't understand eh this kind of dance like I don't
see it being nice it's just like people moving around the body is not I mean it's like ya I mean it's like
ah
uh I think I don't know ah I mean if like one person do on her own ah I don't really enjoy it
but if like many people that kind then it's okay ah
but for me I don't understand contemporary and urban urban lah like
I don't understand the nice to it lah hip hop that's like that's like nice ah I feel like that's nice ya
but like contemporary I don't understand personally I don't understand
I don't appreciate ya
okay so after primary school secondary school secondary school I joined ODEC
outdoor adventure club
so from there I gained a lot of experiences like I went rock climbing dragon boating
and then I joined like competitions where you know like those triathlon kind of thing where you cycle and then you run and then
then after that I got rock climbing kayaking dragon boating
oh I even joined a kayaking uh competition
and ya in
polys ah I mean organised it
but it was secondary school err but the girls managed to got third I think
and the guys I think got second so it was quite a
it's quite err like an achievement for us ah
because we didn't expect to win at all and it was just like a side thing for our
like you know it's not our kayaking it's like outdoor ya outdoor adventure club not
kayaking so it's not our forte kind of thing ya then after that err then we got
kayaking and stuff oh there was rock climbing as well
so there's like a level one cert level two cert and stuff so we got a level one and then we got like
so normally when we did
is normally with
so sometimes when do things we'll also do things ah like those like
err camps and shit and stuff is normally with eh so like ODEC also mostly was boys
so and then like sec four us as the seniors there's only three girls
and everyone was guys and considering with so everyone was guys
and there's only three girls so it was like I mean
for me I feel it was okay lah cause we managed to like I mean
the girls and I we have like those we're not very feminine also
so we're like ya so we're okay
so everything was like unproblematic but like
err secondary school I didn't really enjoy because my teachers weren't very good
teachers ah I would say ya they're they're not very good at teaching and I don't see like kindness in them also only some
but then like my form teachers and stuff like meh so I don't
ya so I didn't really enjoy secondary school and then came to poly the somehow I
got into culinary then after that
oh ya I work at Starbucks before but I so like ya I learn
I learn I learnt like latte art from there and stuff but then like surprising unfortunately
this course the coffee part is like only one part ya
so most of the thing was like in kitchen and shit which I don't really enjoy so I ended up not really enjoying this course lah
and like then ya somehow then after that like although like we did like kitchen practices and stuff but
kitchen really stressful lah the the environment the the environment very stressful and then there was like wine tasting
it's kind of it's kind of cool but meh not my cup of tea
and then somehow I
got through it so here I am now as a tuition centre admin
but I feel like I got most experiences from like my primary school or secondary school lah
poly like not really eh maybe just like smart asia but
that was fun but
nothing much for me lah ya
mm actually I did ah but I feel like my
I feel like my not good enough
mm there's no design meh
mm
mm mm
wow okay mm okay okay okay okay
I didn't know uh uh media is like so enhanced like so many things
mm mm mm mm
what's for you though what's the one that you are good in
creative director what's that
mm
oh like you the posters and stuff lah
ah
oh oh cool cool cool
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
is up to you
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm
mm
then you should like work for like those mm shops maybe like online shops you can work as their like
like social media kind of thing what no meh
mm
mm mm
mm mm then you should open a YouTube channel
why
mm mm
ya that's true you need to like stand out and stuff
mm mm mm mm
ya I also just realised that sia
culinary was really just because of the coffee part lah really
actually ah if I'm not culinary I don't know what other course I would choose though I really cannot I really don't know eh honestly
I mean for you media media I don't see myself in media also but maybe I can do it like
I mean for me I'm someone like can adapt
right I mean that time my I design the poster also right
I don't know sia
ya I feel like I mean I'm that's why I say that can adapt to any like any places lah hor
that's what I'd say
ya true
cannot decide ah
ya I think that's what everyone's problem now ah they don't know what's their main
pro
ya you know jack of all trades
ya
mm mm
mm
mm ya
but I feel like that's what everyone says eh like err experiences over grades but then now I feel like if you have a poly student who's
like uh signing up for this job and you have a uni student but signing up for this job the uni student is always going to get it instead of the poly you know
ya can adapt better but I think they will hire the the uni one honestly
so I don't know lah so I don't when everyone says
ya
your grade not good enough
ya exactly
ya so we're caught up
so
wow
I thought it was a legit quote LOL
I think that's kind of partly true though
but one thing I'd say is like on your quote is like err capitalism like how like how celebrities do very minimal
to get like a lot of amount of money and there are people out there who are working super hard but they are still earning
like the bare bare minimum
mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm ya that's true
ya
and it's sad
ya
ya life in a nutshell or what it's so sad
mm
mm
mm mm mm
ya like people cannot see you enjoy things
I mean like there's always bound to have someone who will be unhappy with your achievements
and stuff like that so ya
ya
ya huh
mm
mm mm
mm ya
mm mm mm
mm
mm
but I think that's what makes up a person ah a person will not have only good sides in him there are bound to have ugly sides in a person also
but then just some people has more ugly sides than good sides in them
mm mm
ah we just don't know what happen behind closed doors
that's true

uh huh
ah yes correct correct
mmhmm
ya
how how does how does it work
in the new uh version
okay
mm mm
so
so basically all the tactics are all
your your choice ah there's no uh you can you can choose whatever tactics you you you run and you can err
do according to your preferences ah
ah okay so there's no like
four four two
mm
mm
so in order for me to play
for example tiki-taka I cannot have a
uh anyhow
five four one kind of formation I have to make sure my uh my formation is flick enough for the tiki-taka or
but okay so once I got the tactics done
is there what's that called the does does the player make a difference ah like there is there a player for example shadow striker
so there's a predefined for who can play what lah
so for the
players also
mm
is there like
they have a preference of what tactics and and uh
mm
mmhmm
okay
ah okay okay okay so
they have their own uh attitude lah and uh they have their own attitude when facing the
ah each games ah
mm
I I heard I heard that there's a new league right denmark is it
ah
if I'm not wrong eh uh the last
that's that's long sia
I was I was I don't know why but I was thinking last year sia last year or last two years
so I eh correct correct two thousand sixteen
it will be ah fifteen
so it's in
one
so the last time I play I play was sixteen
but okay anyway okay before before before I consider playing twenty you think twenty one coming soon or not
oh the the twenty is free
is not a trial or anything
it's a full game for free
ah ya
oh I didn't know it was free
okay
okay okay so maybe later I will later I will plug in the laptop and check it out ah so if okay if I am going to download it
ah
okay
Acer uh you got you got remember what it's a A what
A two nine five okay that one I think I quite lost already
ah K so
there is you got what N N V I D A
okay lah so that means it will be quite smooth I don't know whether my
ah okay
okay
F sixteen and twenty might have a drastic improvement I think there is a drastic improvement
ah
ya I know I know I know
mmhmm
mm
mm mm
I have ah eight hundred gig plus free ya but the thing
the thing
is the thing is I don't know how will it be smooth ah
I don't want jagged jagged uh you know what I'm trying to say right there's there's a
the not seamless enough
ah
ah
ya hopefully
but wasted the twenty is not under epic for switch
cause switch also uh got twenty touch
ah
okay okay
I thought the
say what
outliers what what's that
a'ah
that's a
that's stressful
wait so
so
if I kick out if I sell or I kick out all these influential people ah cause I don't want them to disrupt my my my
reigning off terror ah kan but how how what will what's the repercussion
will I be able to recover or do I have to bring in another influential person if there is such thing
okay
okay
ah
actually true true so for example I give you an example
if I bring
let's say ronaldo cristiano ronaldo
okay from juventus to
maybe
man U
okay from man U
is he
a junior
in man U but he's an alumni
ah okay
ah
okay
mm
ah okay okay okay
okay
so okay ah dortmund sancho is the english guy is it okay okay
mm
let's say let's say
this sancho is is english and let's say his his his old maybe thirty plus
okay let's say he's thirty plus
I bring him to maybe southampton or a or a full of junior club
so he will be a senior player or will he still be considered junior since
he just join the club
ah
mmhmm
mm
okay
okay
this social group is
very important lah actually
ya true that's
as sad as it is that's true
know I mean okay so I'm
the the the twenty inside the epic games store is not a trial not a
not a whatsoever is complete
full game for free
and
it is free on epic games but not
free on steam
okay so wait wait if I download it from epic game
free will the game be locked back or not after twenty four
you know like you know like
mm
okay
okay okay so it's only for epic games ah
okay
okay okay okay
okay I understand already
so maybe after
ah
maybe I would
okay
unfortunately my current laptop don't have a LAN cable
no no as in they don't have the
port for it
ya so so unfortunately my
laptop that has a LAN cable is my
poly era
which is
longer than two thousand fifteen longer than sixteen
I mean
internal cleaning I don't know lah I I
ah
I I mean I I know about the the the
mm
ah
ah ya so anyway I will like I said I will try to how how how big is the file again
okay so
mm
it is intensive ah okay but anyway
okay ah maybe after this then I will give it a try ah
okay lah we can we can
okay if if I already download the the the game then maybe I can discuss some
well technically
if you want to use your social cycle you're the senior guy cause well you downloaded it yesterday
I download it today
yes okay
okay
okay
so
you never play the game I understand you never play you download the game you installed the game
you
look left look right
look look see see lah that's what they called it
now I go to the social circle context I buy this player
I never play him
one day two day okay maybe one season never play him
then I buy another player is he still more senior
yes even if I don't play him
ya so in the sense you are still more senior
in this familiarity
whether you play it or not
okay
mm
they have medical centre
okay no I I I okay I confused
what's the purpose of me jumping and see my injured player cause as a manager I want all I give
is you know
whether
he's at the training or not
mm
okay
I mean I mean
since I mean since the ah twenty is very realistic every every year is getting more and more and more and more realistic
I will be avoiding the medical centre cause I'm not really that sure look outside the window and everyone's wearing face mask and whatnot medical centres the last place you want to visit so for my own
simulated realism safety
I will avoid the medical centre I do not what I
the board of directors not gonna be happy if I have to be quarantine for fourteen days
then what do you expect me to do well manage the football from home
ah so
so imagine actually imagine
twenty one when there's the corona virus realism coming in wait wait imagine this
imagine
you play twenty one
your players got corona virus you got corona virus you got quarantine and then for two weeks two weeks
of being quarantined
you decide you you you said you know what
you gonna take out open your phone and then realise
eh eh how many days left of quarantine do you have
how many days left of real life quarantine you have sia god damn it four more days okay ah nevermind
since the whole two weeks so you got both quarantine in real life you got quarantine in game
that would be a very nice
situation to be in I mean not not the real quarantine lah maybe other people but that will be a very nice story for me to hear other people to be in
ya so ya I don't want to be quarantine
that will be that will be
that will be
prime minister lee hsien loong announces circuit breaker S leagues to stop game
there is a singapore league already if I'm not wrong so how
then if I play the malaysian league
my maybe I don't know I don't know whether players like haris harun still there but borders are closed how's that how's that gonna help me
well technically
ah
if they all go back and then all borders closed how my my malaysian squad is not all malaysians pe is
majority foreigners so just like that I spend millions of ringgit malaysia
for nothing
mm
ah I mean
ah
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay wait
league one semi-pro that's actually very terrible pe
cause semi-pro is supposed to be the
north north south ya north south
how did bolton wanderers end up there
I mean how can they fall that bad
I mean
how how I mean in in what situation would how would club be that what what bad decision they can make
ya okay
I remember portmore
a'ah
okay
okay
mm
so okay ah
deducting points just cause you are
just cause you are bankrupt
means you will have a higher chance to get relegated
which means you continue to get bankrupt
sorry what
ya I mean like okay you see ah
how is there's no
maybe maybe our country is quite good
but there's no government support
there's ya there's no support for this kind of things so if I make you see eh when I
relegated
I have reduced
reduced amount of budget reduce reduce reduce reduce reduce
and cause I have all these reduced I cannot support myself I have to declare bankruptcy or maybe in the red zone for financial and then cause of that they deduct my points for me to get relegated and reduced even further and even further even further
until I become just nothing ah
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
okay okay so
wait wait wait
this if if your if there is there
clubs so far that you know
they just drop and drop and drop and nobody give
and a
them any any any chance
and they just disappeared from all the place
okay
mm
I mean you can ask juventus how they manage to drop so so much
suddenly
that one is their what italian one is it
oh okay
okay
mm
mmhmm
oh that's so
wah
ya correct
mmhmm
ah yes yes
mm mm
ah okay I mean
well that's
err when they are from the group of fans and whatnot then suddenly just cause of financial difficulties
your passion that football just disappear just like that
cause there were
mm mm
there is know the
even below north south
time for them to just you know what
not just the leagues itself but the entire sport industry as a whole ah
ah
ah
ah that's why
ya
ya but
day
I mean technically if everyday
ya if you are
okay
used to be passionate about it I used to
I used to you know why or not cause you know
sometimes people
err physical
body change
and I may not be able to do the
top collar safe as I managed to do
as bad
no no no
no no no no I'm not I'm not fat is just I not I not
fat cause that's a very harsh way of describing certain diseases and handicap I'm not saying I am
one of the rare few who are not suffering world hunger ah
ya I mean I'm not I'm not suffering world hunger ah I'm the privileged one as compared to
so
but anyway anyway we put it aside ya I mean I used to why I said I used to have passion is cause
body change
unfortunately and my body change reflexes change
your mind can't keep up with what your body more and at the same time
when you fly when you jump and fly high
increase weight means increase pain
so I'm not gonna risk it
that was after secondary school after first year poly
second year poly I start I stop already
ya
so poly
poly year two
year three
year one year two
CISCO CISCO oh that's almost seven years
ah
six seven six seven years I never play

I mean that's a good idea ah
I mean true
you want to be
ah
mm
I mean technique ya I mean true you have to let it go
but I'm quite surprised why
he managed to win the ball in that manner in the first place
yes
watch football would be know recently lah uh after army
I don't catch up already cause know
people watch football at three I'm you know guarding certain installations which is not very fun at all I'm I mean I it's fun to guard certain installations
if you know maybe you are
than the cool installations I don't like it I I
is is how do I say eh
it makes you wonder it makes you ask yourself this question
you work so hard
okay you work so hard to to to to be in the middle income you work so hard to get out of the peasants and the farmers only only to safeguard
the peasants and the farmers
which is like a sandwich
know like sergeant being sandwiched by the men and by the officer bro it's the same thing you're sandwiched you have no
how do I say you have no freedom still
but ya true ah
to ah
well I mean
like what
require unprecedented measures to be honest I don't even know exactly what the
precedented meaning is until he keep repeating until
suddenly I know the meaning without even googling it
so so that's how good he is you know
maybe he should just remain as education minister cause
he just keep repeating things until we know the meaning
without finding it out
mm
if you notice
eh he cannot speak tamil pe
then he shouldn't
mm
election before the previous election two thousand fifteen
okay
mmhmm
uh huh
nobody dubbed over him kan
if you're thirty minute speech I can just say vanakam for thirty times ah for for thirty minutes pe I think that would work it's not like I'm not gonna fool anyone it's not being I I mean technically if you who who who's gonna listen
english
of course ah
understand it is
okay anyway actually there something funny I need to need to share with you you see ah my my
grandfather my
basically all the old people ah
all the our not say ancestors our elders right
I realised one thing when they grow old they speak in mother tongue I mean you I I haven't heard anyone come come out and speak in proper british english
to me lah so far so
I have when I was young
I asked my grandfather he said I say why your I I ask him in in malay why your always speak malay
and you know what he told me that until now traumatise not say traumatise kind of until now I bring you know he said
ah the only language you will remember will be mother tongue
so so so I grow up thinking that is the way
then I then I ask myself if my mother tongue is is crap
how the heck am I gonna communicate when I grow old what people just gonna write me up as dementia or what
ya
mmhmm
okay
a'ah
mm
a'ah
mm
mm
ah
mm mm
okay
okay
ya correct
mm
but actually
I I haven't pin it but then the the things changed when I was working as a in in checkpoint and then I I met into this uh
not say rider ah this passenger who needs to need to go to toilet if I'm not wrong
need to go to toilet or need to get the white paper white white pass so he so she came to me very old lady in
and then and he and she asked me in english about I don't know toilet or the white paper thing the white form
what want to go from johor to singapore and whatnot right so I was confused I say what I mean the english was very good
right
a malay a a malay old lady walking to me in walking sticks with walking sticks I mean
looking at another malay officer at that point of time
and speak in english so I take the passport and there was a tiger
logo down there her malaysian passport holder
who um who is a malay elder with walking stick I don't know why so important about the walking stick okay I have to emphasise
but but coming to a obvious malay officer
mandarin or tamil lah if not there will be quite a very big job but she choose english and honestly the english is more fluent ah and then I
reply
I I I when I want to reply in english I feel very awkward
I mean talking to talking to
a malaysian
in a old old lady old old lady in malaysia
a malaysian old lady I mean
right wah this is very confusing ah
but technically technically technically I'm not wrong there
both descriptions are true pe
well from
ya should use the word from ya so anyway okay
so
imagine speaking
tiptop formal or maybe as clear cut english not singlish ah no sia
so you imagine you say that to an obvious maybe like a relative or a cousin where you have to use the word ma'am
but
I suspect
I mean the car is quite posh and whatnot but
then you you make me wonder
so what english is your mother tongue
that's why you grow up remember english as your core language
mm
so how
a'ah
mm
okay
you you agree pe okay say if I only know english for example then when I grow old I say lah how
ah
ya that's why
ah
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm
so so I mean
maybe you never know until you grow up that that's for sure I mean I'm not
I'm not going to you know bite my tongue or hold my breath or anything maybe one day you when you grow old you speak to me in french or italian I'm not gonna hold my breath
the the idea of we both growing old is not to understand each other how many times right
remind each other about know how your going and calling each other brother in italian pe
okay but you you understand what I trying to say pe
the group of people has been the same thing over and over again
cause they are old and nobody listens
mm
ya
I mean ah there there is a I think there's a occasion pe there's a certain
old indian guy at the coffee shop who
apologise over and over again
yet he's always interrupting us oh by the way ah
mm
so
so so so he got the you know he
I
the number is already one I from level eleven stop at level eight right he go in he hold the door open
but if somebody is going down I'm pretty sure there's a very high chance
err right if I from
if I were my high high level going down I'm
don't judge I don't want to talk so much
there's a very high chance
when the number is already pressed the red colour light is already at number one try to assume he's going number one
cut the conversation move along
then
mm
ah
okay okay
ah coming up ya
correct correct
I mean
that one for what eh
okay
okay
okay
mm
ah ah ah
ah that is quite long tau
ya actually a lot of things changed ah
but it's nice
ah ya lah
think it's time for us to actually
get a proper second house
like work or or or or whatnot lah I mean it's so so constricted lah this place to be honest
uh twenty twenty four seven
you wake up early in the morning you come back at there is a
there's a ah there is a schedule
ah
ah now is just wake up you don't know what you gonna do
going go with the flow and then the whole day twenty four good hours just wasted like that
I mean
now is already twenty september pe you you there's what is it called your your
work not you already burn half a day in your birthday already tau
how unproductive are you going to get
how more
more unproductive are you going to get
you don't feel embarrassed
technically
I know
mmhmm
there is a
ya
yes
I mean I tried to warn you
I mean ya I know I understand how you feel to to to to be squeezed
just for maintenance ah
mm
ya I know I know
I mean
wow that sucks
mm
ya ya
I mean just like that eh
err
a a billion dollar company multi billion dollar company just
gone sia
but
I mean oil should be cheaper right or
it already
keep it up
picking up already
ah
mm
I mean ya lah ya lah there
will go back
to
quote unquote our prime minister status
for unpaid
I mean
I mean I'm not saying anything lah but in order for you to you know
move forward in this pandemic is to ensure the china tension doesn't rise any higher cause
as long as and china is continue to be fighting I don't think there will be a vaccine anytime soon
ah
ah ya
okay
ah
now that's a very interesting concept
ah
ah ah
mm mm
okay
I
I don't want to die
the what's that called I mean I don't know what the are trying to think ah but
but uh I mean if we see uh
technically if the government is not very
is saying is saying that the mask does not work
I think we can raise it up to our ah and
ah
so maybe we can raise up to our and ask our government to release us from this
mask thing I mean
we got safe entry pe
the the thing is does it work though
