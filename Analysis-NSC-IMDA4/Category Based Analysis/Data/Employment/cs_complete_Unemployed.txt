alright boleh
boleh eh okay so basically aku tanya uh whoever living at my place first to do this lah cause I thought need to do at my house
then I aku call siapa ham boy dengan uh I they technically live near my place what so easier so I call them dua dua tak nak buat
I actually oh my god I forgot to tell ham he told me uh dia nak fikir dulu
ah nanti kita sign up then wasted tak dapat macam mana
no is based on macam first come first basis
okay basically err my friend hantar aku ni okay before that she wanted me to go for a debate
sekali suddenly she just sent me this lah so I actually thought this was a debate
ah so aku so I ask my mum first if she allow she say okay
then I ah call you lah uh I was looking for people ah macam ham boy
actually one of my friend who stay kat
ah very near right tapi dia tak nak
like I don't I don't get some people punya mindset macam
tak kan satu jam pun tak boleh berbual
oh my god teruk
merepek no no no seriously
ah actually aku call kawan aku ni pasal
bukan because the thing why they don't want ah ask you first is because you live very far away I thought you need to come and to my place
ah always any conversation we have automatic kita selalu mix gini mix gitu mix gini mix gitu
kita tukar question jer ah
tukar question
let me guess kau kene kerja for
settle down relax there K dah settled
even ex players also tell me is I don't know like for leisure leisure okay lah tapi nak
commit and ah macam apa
ah but then nak cakap dorang bayar ke tak tu lain cerita lah
six fifty nine I aku dah kat rumah
the fifty nine second aku dah kat rumah
so they talk about the dulu orang Turkey macam mana macam mana dorang settle hal
uh rumah tangga
uh musuh
cucuk belakang and all ah oh my god I tell you
marah sampai nak bang table ada serious serious it it was all emotion
so primary four I was like you know competing with this guy that guy macam the race to become first in class ah
then sekali come to primary five dah kerek kan two years in a row ah don't need study ah lepak ah
instead of the okay sekarang kita dah first in class eh kita focus jer how to be best in the cohort
so aku start bergaul dengan dorang be like them
lepak kat luar lah ah tak belajar after oral
aku main catching
ah prank orang punya rumah ketuk pintu lari you know
past tak terjadi
but as annoying and cliche and you know like jijik as it is
yeah oh my god dorang punya cara berbual
some um country ah they you need to pay first know walaupun berapa critical apa dah nazak ke pe you need to pay first before the surgery happen
like dulu punya time ah
macam yeah people work work but they work for
for K for example orang dulu we they can have chicken they can have cows and all that
let me phrase that ya what apa manusia kena ada supaya kita hidup
dia punya masalah yang betul kan is actually apa tau
life hidup
macam life is so simple
we don't talk about now we talk about ten years from this since the creation of mankind ada je masalah
everyday activity lah bukan kerja ke apa macam K for me
nanti muak pe
and what jelak sama jer lah
eh kau tahu itu hari aku mimpi tau pasal sekolah
macam apa tau dia punya ayam doesn't look good dia punya telur doesn't look good
yang mana lebih sedap which one looks more appetising because for me
intuition that I can read people face so like I know oh muka gini ah gini ah orangnya
like oh muka dia macam gini rambut dia macam gini oh macam gini ah orang dia
so tak ah so basically I can tell you two experiences in my life which I was wrong
I expected you to be a super mat rep
err perang perang kan
so actually alamak confirm mat rep eh fikir dia siapa sia
like for example try what we do go to engineering course I think the apa the headmaster apa
course head eh apa
kau confirm menyesal sikt kenapa hamizan tak ingat
what skill eh apa kita boleh buat let me see let me see
aku tengah tengok dia orang punya question
I mean I heard of it before tapi macam
so me and cyprus skip class kau tahu kan cerita ni
and terjumpa fabian
then you know his uh dia punya cara marah macam mana kan see he will talk nicely then suddenly he shout
takde lah
I was always with cyprus and at that point of time I was like you know researching about laptops lah ni lah tu lah ni lah tu lah
ah definitely adalah orang nak beli laptop so I can them like bombard them
precisely but my grades are not good enough to even you know try to get into a apa
so aku macam oh my god
points better like apalah nak jadi
kenapa lah hidup macam ni
it's for me is merepek ah like I I can't believe ah macam
K ah kalau gini dah tak boleh masuk poly kan what what's the point
obviously ah kita macam you know what
kita punya pathway macam gini jer
ya macam is merepek bila kita kat sekolah dorang bagi kerja masih sikit jer
abeh kalau kat rumah I mean K fine fine it's true we are free we are more free
precisely I aku it is
I find it super merepek
so it it made me like oh you know what ah so tiring ah malas ah
ah tak leh ah tak leh ah
abeh come by my house lah one once in a while
eh kim cam
pergi pe ons see you in five minutes five minutes eh toa payoh to woodlands
why your apa engine so loud
yeah I never heard of it before tak pernah dengar
kau tahu aku punya orang singkit sikit sikit jer singkit dia
but you have to apa
apply for like you need to queue wait for like six seven hours kenapa
kenapa ah
kalau kau tanya aku eh mm
okay kalau kau tanya aku this about
if they give us like pre before you masuk right
dorang kata if we pass we get two months off know
okay for example kalau soccer we don't need upper body strength technically technically
kalau basketball oh definitely ah you need upper body strength ah but that means
like I pay for competition semua
izzul kau jangan pass kau jangan shoot eh sorry sorry sorry
no no no K basically in basketball kan kalau kau main
so my game and dorang punya game tak sama definitely they are better game sense than me
not to my knowledge macam
dorang buat ni aku tak boleh counter
tak kira apa-apa lah
you know because uh you have to understand in Singapore susah nak dapat natural food even it comes to the most natural thing
correct so parents aku suka apa tau they like err
air bahasa melayu apa ah
angin tu wind
oksigen ah ni dalam melayu properly ah eh
oksigen ah the proper the proper malay pronunciation for oxygen
G E N oksigen
kau punya okay ah let me see eh
then tak tahu dapat dorang punya salary ke tak
dorang punya families kat overseas macam mana
book reservation punya
kalau dorang buat ni eh kalau dorang buat ni kan
dorang punya tracking system pun senang tau actually you know what implement to all shops
dorang buat gini senang nak track orang
untuk orang turun dengan nak masuk kedai right
tapi satu masalah will be apa tau
okay lah playing sports and all is a different thing lah you need to you know move because like berapa hari lepas kan aku kat rumah je aku macam dah tak leh tahan
so I just need to get up I I so I went to play takraw kat serangoon sana

considerable amount of space to joget-joget
move around lah at least I got I can have stuff to throw around like bersepahkan
I can upgrade myself but then the thing is everything semua sekarang tengah mahal I don't know ah like
I have no idea okay lah probably yes I have an idea what is is mahal now because
panasnya ya allah
then that that that's the thing price should be kurang apa should be lesser what
and nak itu pasang apa
and then have to pasang another door it's going to be costly it is going to cost like more then two three hundred dollars already
the outside of the house was like rimas
then after that bersepah lagi then rimas makin lama makin lama makin rimas
ya I miss that place because of the hall and then it was overlooking the pool the huge windows I have this thing with windows ah tingkap macam best
kan mahal
you fikir masak-masak dulu like from now until february because he was thinking of moving in february
then I was like fikir masak-masak dulu like if you move in
kenapa mama nak pergi kranji suddenly
okay then cause suddenly she message me out of the blue kata nak pergi kranji tak three day two night then I was like wait what was I doing just that time ah I was like I think I was settling my mum's you know then like super busy lah then suddenly dapat message tu abeh I macam eh apasal suddenly but she didn't tell taufik at all
ah so yesterday I told taufik like eh my mum got message you or not that she wants to do all these thing then taufik was like just shaking his head so she haven't discuss like what why she want to go bila nak pergi mama tak ada bilang ah
itu dekat dengan jalan rasuk eh
so entah lah so let's just wait until mama like reply whether is it like a go ahead or not I mean if she wants to go to sentosa capella I don't mind lah cause you can use the hundred dollars voucher for that what then this one suddenly I'm like cam mana nak kata no
ya lor the the the new park royal is also err halal ya ya ya my sis is going I think in december my both my sis my sis-in-law they are bringing all the budak-budak kecil ah ada some glamping for kids inside the hotel rooms ya
ya then you can use the hundred dollars the rediscover voucher also but this morning I was like looking at the list lah didn't see the kranji one but I saw ada ada apa eh oh I saw got capella then capella you have the spa inside the room
then besides that ada apa lagi eh um W hotel the sentosa one also I mean it's a little bit upscale but then you can use that hundred dollars voucher then all of us can use together right so okay daripada kranji
eh it baru keluar ah
tu lah
eh kalau snow city I can ask any of my ex-colleagues what then can go in for free
ya nanti lah next time we go over to your house I will ask mama what she wants to do but not this two weeks this two weeks like crazy gila
not son of a peach punya
err block one two eight is near to the swimming pool behind the hill ya so masa I kecil-kecil there will always be like sounds of dogs howling at night
then there will also be macam ada bau tak sedap ah but okay my family tak kena sangat ah but our neighbour pernah
nak dengar ghost story
so my neighbour I think tingkat dua we stay at the fourth floor so at night I think pukul sepuluh ke apa there was somebody who came over to their house macam you know the makcik-makcik jual keropok err they went at ten o’clock why do you open the door to a person who selling things right but my neighbour go and open ah so it it was a makcik selling cake tunjuk the cake all that so macam my neighbour kasihan then my neighbour pun beli lah the cake
so the makcik dah go off I think the next day they open up the cake there was a batu nisan inside
I think mama got tell a little bit of this story before then she like tersipu-sipu
K wait let me tell you the story of my parents punya renovation so they just got the key on deepavali like after like one month of extension then that one also like a little bit of a merepek ah cause the previous tenant they don't want to give the key to the letter box then my parents have to like repeatedly ask for it sebab dorang dah change dorang punya address
abeh entah lah like very niao ah so after that eventually they wanted to give the key on fifteen of november deepavali is fourteen but their agreement is only until fourteen of november so obviously my parents not happy it's just one day but then that weekend is a weekend yang they wanted to clean up the house cause sixteen november they will start the renovation already
so err eventually on fourteen november they got the key then um we went to the house the next day taufik pun pergi the house used to house twenty cats in the master bedroom
it was super smelly then the toilet was also super smelly we wash the master bedroom a few times everytime cuci jer keluar like black black black it's a few times you know then we went to pet store to beli the odour eliminator ah spray around a few times I think err we went on sunday last spray for the things then err I went again on monday
the next day ah the next day bau masih tak hilang ah cause twenty cats seh so spray spray spray lagi still tak hilang abeh bila I balik I was like having like a huge headache then err eventually I call err macam professional cleaning service
like they really will use an ozone generator to produce ozone to shock the smell and then they will they use a chemical atomiser juga so the chemical they break it down into like super super small molecule so that it can go into the porous surfaces ah so yesterday the person came the person it's a malay guy then the masuk the nak buat dia eh
tanya eh ni ada berapa kucing ni seh lepas tu I cakap dengan dia lah ada ada twenty cats dia macam wah teruk seh but he was like telling us that err okay ah the smell can be removed so he did all the things and then as he was doing it suddenly he went to one of the switch so dia pergi dekat switch then he call us lah say eh I think this house ada pijat punya infestation juga
because apparently on top of the switch ada colour black black black which is actually an indication of tahi pijat ah so he was like hopefully all the pijat bila orang tu angkat dah bawa sekali ah the all the bed bugs semua but we don't know whether inside the switch plug itself there will be pijat or not so yes but yesterday my mum pergi dah tak ada the smell sangat so I guess it worked but
ya err the pijat is at the switch so the electrician also came over yesterday was thursday wednesday the electrician came over on wednesday to to to ask what to change ah so we are changing the all the switches also just to be safer ya
they when they went tak ada the smell sangat and then macam um I think they hide the cats or they spray something on top but ada lah macam dua tiga ekor kucing kat the living room so macam we thought it was only two or three cats right so okay lah but end up the cause they went again macam
after they got the keys then the people ask for extension kan so during that period of time they ask whether can go over to the house to like do measurements for the renovation so initially they didn't allow lah dorang tak kasi then dah jadi my parents house apa so my parents pergi tu yang they were shocked
to see like twenty cats there oi kalau I think if my parents tahu pun they wouldn't have the house lah but no momok so it's okay
kencing kucing tak apa lah jangan kencing hantu ke apa ke
you cari you cari dekat which what site
have you tried yang those the punya job fairs pun tak ada
and as in mendaki sense what mendaki sense pun dorang will go to like some companies
aduh entah lah
or not really I mean tak ada bonus ah and all that apa ya as long as still something ah like my dad got a job my dad kan masa tu kena retire he got a job pun tu tak dapat bonus ke apa so that one is that only contract for one year ya
oh that time my brother my brother is still stuck in qatar right he had to fly back the he had to fly the plane to singapore so he manage to see his family kat airport for like one minute to lambai-lambai only
ya but um he also kena so even though they stay at crowne plaza I think all the pilots the flight attendants semua kena stay at crowne plaza so ya lah they only like macam see each other bila my brother keluar dari the sky train then my sister-in-law and the ya and his uh daughter cuma lambai
but tak boleh jumpa what is in different room so what my sister-in-law did was she my my brother dah lama tak makan makanan melayu right so
he requested for nasi lemak on the first for the breakfast then for lunch he asked for apa benda tu nasi ambeng or is it laksa one of it lah then malam he asked for bandung
missing all the local food simon to either macam like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
err they have malaysian restaurant there but then it's still macam makanan the variety is not as much lah ya
what oh mama high class you tak tahu ke
ya but mama high class lah that time ah she was watching her japan show eh at at your house lah then she texted me err nura masa tu kita ada stay dekat hotel tokyo one one of the atas hotel lah then I say no we didn't stay at the atas hotel we stayed at another like the same branch but the cheaper version then she was like wah situ ada makanan halal
abeh I said but we also eat makanan halal apa
actually if apa right if you just go with your parents type or my parents we could have stayed in Airbnb ah then can cook and all that
but the thing is mama is not very macam open to try food ya it's like macam she said like macam okay for example like when she went vulcans right I ask her so did you eat like vulcan food then she said actually not really lah we just eat like indian food all this thing then I ask mama like what's the point kan you're supposed to go like if you go to greece you're supposed to eat greek food you know but then you just go there you end up eating tandoori chicken which you can also eat in singapore
ah itu ramen tu
oh kita orang tak bawa pergi ah sashimi sushi restaurant that time we ate tempura ya ramen miso but not sushi she say she oh tak makan seaweed kan so tak bawa ah but all the rest dorang makan banyak obese apa
no idea ya like even the um balik punya flight she was like she said she eat a lot finish up the food all
I agree eh tapi kan nasi lemak I still prefer the silk air punya have you tried ah
oh my god the silk air punya is so nice ya oh I think out of all the err nasi lemak okay ah not counting like parents masak semua kan silk air nasi lemak is like up there ya but you cannot choose what so depends on your luck whether you will get the silk air with nasi lemak or not
like people say malaysia punya nasi lemak sedap kan I think silk air one that one is sedap
so I was telling taufik like maldives kan ada banyak island kan like can you open up one island just for singaporeans untuk okay what
I think ni kena write in to maldives nya government kan
tak boleh eh
ya lah for as long as he stay there I'm going to like betul-betul tekan
flying some of his friends have been retrenched like err he's flying A three fifty so a three fifty ada banyak flights so during the COVID period he has been to canada he was in new york he was in seattle he was in singapore he was in melbourne err where again
abeh the later later one banyak like holiday people ya but qatar dia punya border control is still strict not like macam
and if they come direct they will have to take the COVID test so some of them they go to first they stay there for fourteen days so to lepaskan the requirement of the singapore government ah lepas tu baru they fly to singapore expert
okay lah not expert but ya that's what they did I mean I was reading the there's this facebook group called the indians in singapore ah like the you know I will read the bangladeshi community in singapore then I read the malaysia singapore malaysians border crosser so recently I venture the indians in singapore so it's like malaysian punya banyak like jiwang-jiwang
or rindu family cakap dua minggu jer sekarang dah lapan bulan that kind of thing then I would say the indians in singapore banyak oh where is the class for this err ataupun rented room and talk about how to get to singapore if cannot be direct that kind of thing so ya I find out that they go through
our own life walaupun macam tak banyak benda going on but it's still like a lot of things happening
eh but my parents punya company so far quite good
tapi kan they tak hack the flooring for the they tak hack flooring semua ah they hack the skirting pastu they ah oh the service yard kan kita punya ada the that door the windows ah that one can hack they hack it out
oh ya macam face the apa the main road ke
but actually five year at ubi ones are not bad macam like my house kalau dah five year and a lot of people kan jual the the house if they take care of their houses actually it's not bad it's if you get the previous owner yang teruk tu yang ya ya you have a lot of things to do but I'm sure like if if we sell your house you will buy right
the five year one ah is one that you can consider cuma maybe you have to do the toilet ah
no it's homogeneous tiles but somehow when we went that time they were the only company to have this kind of tiles yang macam like a little bit kasar-kasar
ya true ours actually our renovation company is very good cuma sekarang dah tak ada lagi I don't know where they go
entah lah like competition
ya ours macam the my sister punya is like newer tapi dorang punya barang macam lagi cepat pecah ours kalau you tengok the door kan yang dia punya handle is quite solid but my sister punya macam kena picit banyak baru dia buka
kan abeh dia punya tempat masak the hood dah jatuh-jatuh
ya so if you want to buy buy techno jangan beli bosch
ah ya ya kena macam ada talk forum
then after a few years you kena tukar kan ya ours is granite but now got a lot of new new types of counter top my parents is using this thing called vulcan I also just first time I heard of it masa kita orang pergi that's why it's like um it's
um it's a little bit more atas than quartz and it can go up to the wall also so the dia punya tu macam fulfilling macam very atas kitchen
okay lah I why they didn't choose quartz that time oh cause kita orang pemalas they say that granite can withhold heat better than quartz jadi sebab kita nanti take the pot terus letak on the kitchen counter
taufik and I are the pemalas kind
granite the good thing is ya lah if it can withstand heat all that but the porous I think after awhile it will become porous pastu um tak banyak choices as compared to quartz
they say after a few years you kena buat sealing dia lah but kita orang tak pernah buat abeh nampak macam still okay apa takyah lah malas ya
oh okay dekat sini ada mister but I don't know whether they will have the washi tape ke tidak
okay lah okay lah I think some of the stuff not expensive ah but gold colour you better better have to go to JCube dah lama seh tak pergi jcube if I go there I will only go to JEM tomorrow jcube a bit out of the way ah
dorang nak tutup the temporary interchange to pindah to another temporary interchange kan did you read
it will be a temporary interchange again dah ten years eh
I work oh wait before I start working or is still the old one pastu I work the pindah to the temporary interchange and then I dah quit work dah three years with nparks baru pindah to another temporary and then last I read another ten years baru siap
so I cakap hillion dah siap dan yishun punya dah siap and then ah yes correct I think woodlands punya pun will be done before the jurong one will be done who the ah
ada masa the fifty was it ah fifty they say that by the year twenty twenty err apa they will move the science centre then science centre masih kat tempat lama aduh
entah lah ya I mean I would prefer at jurong lah cause you got more food choices I mean it's not like I'm working there still but the lakeside apparently it's supposed to be macam dekat dengan water feature entah lah but oh they said after that err they say that in the twenty twenties they will start breaking the ground err ya
abeh before COVID kenapa tak nak start
apa jer aduh well that's jurong for you tapi jurong punya rumah mahal
that's why after the news came out then the price went up and then news kata that they will no longer do the the price went down again then now might be up again so the price went up again so it all depends whether the is ada ke tidak
kalau you beli rumah nak beli kat mana
no it's just too expensive actually kan taufik and I were like looking to upgrade ke tidak tau cause like we were thinking lah that there was a period of time where mama say that she wants to come here stay over lah but we don't have any extra room what so we were thinking right should we upgrade to four room I mean I don't know whether you notice but we change our fan
we we were thinking of that but the thing is tapi sebab entah err like that lah slowly lah ya then apanya
we like the house punya location you know bawah there's a direct bus to town then you look over you can see like some greenery tak you don't see like into neighbour punya rumah so nak cari like really our criteria susah
like our neighbours are also okay pastu we have like area kat rumah to plant our garden
the area is in front of our house not in front of their house so takpe lah dorang pun dapat menikmati all the pemandangan-pemandangan plants yang taufik bawa balik
tak lah dia pun tengok agaknya dia tengok our area quite nice jadi dia takyah tambah dia tengok alah tak ada pokok besar lah jadi dia letak satu pokok besar dekat situ
ya holidays during off peak period it's cheaper the places that I went I want to go to pun tak crowded then ya then cheap and the tak crowded is the most important criteria
oh ya sekarang parents semua ada whatsapp chat right
pecah-pecah but we don't mind lah cause we know that you can always put back what but those she's always whenever she go to a new place she will become very pemalu kepala tunduk tak nak tengok orang macam macam like perempuan apa melayu terakhir eh
so that's why bawa dia lah pergi wash hands semua pastu keluar dia nampak lego jer terus macam hundred and eighty degrees turn ah like oo what's this pastu ambil then usually for all these kids they will run with my lego they will play with mine because mine is construction set so that it's relatable to them but if they see taufik punya dorang tak faham
because star wars kan so all the err apa all the vehicles they they don't understand this but my niece she just take seh and then one of the transformer cup ah you cannot see that it can be open but she knows that you can open it up then she said oh what's inside then she actually open up
and macam take out all the mini fixed ah aduh and ya she's also the first one to take thanos we have a thanos mini fix then she take thanos and she was so excited
she is she is two years old pastu dah dah dah do a lot of things lah then start riding a bicycle oh dah can understand a lot ah oh she can baca ayat kursi also
ya kalau dekat schools nak deal with the parents pastu to them they will think that it's okay but it it's actually like not okay for other kids you know and then they will learn from each other wah macam mana seh mm ya lah that one is also like my last priority
what's that ya for the seven years I dah tak boleh tahan ah at least this one it's a bit different
better to do different different things then my brain pun tak mendak sangat
yes correct dah hafal sangat
I tak pernah buat tuition like
oh dear actually why they why madrasah tak ambil like the err trained teachers ah
entah lah I'm not too sure
and my sis nak hantar my niece masuk madrasah tau
ah I tak tahu so next year my niece three years old then dia nak hantar pergi those macam ah hafal quran punya classes all that
mm so don't know lah cause I think my my sis just that she's working in a school ya now also I think she see the school environment she get like a bit scared so dia kata takpe lah dia nak hantar the my niece pergi masuk madrasah so let's see how it goes anyway baru two years old seh
ya asalkan you ada education you know you get your your cert this that you can use to find a job that's good enough but these people they really macam plan out everything for their children
I don't know what kind of parent I will be I but I think taufik will be very hands on he will bring the kid to the garden make the kid touch all the plants ya make the kid apa bau all the plants also ya I can imagine that
kenapa tak botanist seh
eh dulu I kecil-kecil kan I don't know whether I got tell you before I wanted to be a farmer
oh I I really wanted to jaga my own kambing-kambing like like want to be self-sustainable gitu like have my kambing-kambing oh sheep sheep so I can like err jual dia punya wool then um like kat new zealand then kat switzerland ke then like macam ada a small muslim community there so I boleh buatkan korban lah dekat their
bro aku frus ah bro
what happened did you watch the game last week the okay okay okay okay okay okay fine I watch the man U game and I also watch liverpool game aku punya bingit which man U game the one with crystal palace ah
K K K admittedly macam macam budak-budak ah macam main dengan boy look look at look at wilfried freaking zaha what he what he did to us and what he could have been for us but no thanks to
geram seh then then and then this whole freaking transfer window where we are talking about gareth bale and sergio aguero and and thiago
but oh look dia pun sign the only work
and he says he doesn't know and this guy says he has a bunker iPad bunker with a full football knowledge database pakai football manager semak
david moyes kat mana dia baru lawan arteta last week
eh but but honestly speaking I think liverpool gonna angkat again ah the korang punya the only thing you all needed was that was exactly that that guy in the middle who can keep things simple and can also do the spectacular thiago
from passing from right to left left to right cause you can break through the middle so that's how josie monaco dominates without the ball like the barcelona against inter milan punya game ah barcelona ah eh sorry um
I the chaos manager is is what clock came from his school he doesn't van gaal doesn't like instincts that's why he always takes people he always tell people take one one step of the ball control the ball then shoot you will berate anyone yang terus shoot the ball tau
ah basically he wants the bag for of the opponent to kelam kabut he lose the ball there
ya but klopp he he demands the intensity and that kelam kabut
oh sun sun sun sun sun sun sun ah whatever lah melayu swan melayu
bro I have not been playing in that long for a long time aku main best twenty one ah sekarang eh best twenty twenty
ah okay let let me correct that I play a simulation game okay macam FIFA championship manager you is numbers bro lain sia bro ayam itik

hazard a guess benda ni dekat
oh boleh pilih-pilih ah
primary school mak

mampus serious ah
robert pattison I cannot bayang that man after that glittery shit show on
so you are talking about macam child molesting kind of
okay talking about children aku baru berbual dengan bini aku a few days ago okay I I don't subscribe to Netflix cause I have an app which can get all netflix movies or shows for free
okay bini aku
aku ada Android box but also the smart pun can install there
okay so bini aku past few days we're talking about this she mentioned this Netflix thing tau about how
uh in the last week or last few days alih-alih macam
cause they're controversy people are boycotting cuties and apa okay ah to
quote yahoo news or something it's it's at a multi year high the level of substitution cause of this duties thing ah and kau kau tahu the controversy behind it
this de-sexualisation of minors kan selalunya I would say kan syaiton slowly syaiton is slowly inserting his influence on these things ah
but err you know I I didn't even look trailer I just look at the freaking post and yell what the heck you don't even they are twins budak-budak ni they are just
it's my niece ah ones from that age right now so I feel it's freaking sick and you you it's creepy when you detach yourself from that film but into the real world tau kau imagine eh the fact that

ah ya lah ya lah one of the subject people from france punya territories ah
but ya from breaking free from the traditions of senegal ini kan but that's that's the thing she she's justifying it by saying like oh it's a coming of
aku nak tahu ni who who who was there even a was there a casting couch for this thing who's the person who who vetted through all this girls and look through budak-budak sebelas tahun macam
he's he plays like nerdy character macam he himself looks like
a'ah sia eh makin is it okay when back in korang ada dengar rumours
one of my junior in and err budak he err lieutenant in the army when I when I came in through when I was in he was already a lieutenant
he went after then ah and he okay dia dia
dia macam apa tau he's the eager to please ah
I can imagine him kalau dalam eh if you take a platoon in their time
he's one of those who first to volunteer first to it very on the ball nak good kid
very quiet ah dengar cakap
always does his best and high flyer in terms of academics and not a bit so dia physically small but willing to push himself
when I was a recruit in the army kat canteen and and dekat cookhouse and he's a lieutenant there he saw me then he
pause for moment and he's dia gagap tau dia macam err err where he almost called me sir
setahun jer ah ah but you know I retain one year that kind of thing so
his face came out in the news lah surat khabar aku baca straits times I not sure whether he did it or not lah I mean if he go by islamic standards I have to verify
did dia nya he put in the dark net or something
orang kita ah

and the thing is what I find important is the prinsip behind the marriage tau pasal back in our ancestors punya time dorang
it's not just a matter of it's a matter of prinsip and honour as well tau macam you don't marry for love you marry first and you make the relationship work the love will come later
they he determines the man is suitable then meminang

should die ya actually ni cantik eh
actually even this one dekat letak dekat apa ni the dining are pun cantik ah
this is so cantik
eh cepat lah babi ah
tak apa I think for now kita kena err try our best to talk to fill in the one hour ahead
yes okay so apa yang sulaiman Twitter macam mana nak start
okay so basically sejak dulu I've always wanted to go to the kampung nak stay the night tapi sulaiman dah ajak so tak dapat tidur overnight cuma setakat gi mancing overnight then aku ni expert pergi sana without any proper clothing
and uh the the dah jadi mangsa to all these sandflies that's why right now you can see that I'm wearing all these sleeves to cover my aurat
err I went to the one that is nearer to to sulaiman's house juga lah it's it's just a
kalau jetty tu jauh jetty tu is really quite a distance this one is yang kat belakang kampung you'll be able to walk to this particular part of the beach then kat sana kita gi cast our rods lah
no that time was all the way to jelutong that one is all the way at the other end of the island yang ni betul-betul kat belakang kampung melayu
tak tahu orang melayu kan
okay you need a best part err banyak petuk tapi is just yang ikan yang aku tunjuk tu ah yang ikan tudung periuk
or in english we say the spotted sequel fish ya tapi ikan tu the story lagi best
aku dah mancing aku sengaja feel nak reel in tapi bila dah dapat eh tiba-tiba ganas betul-betul kau dapat rasa lawan bila kita dah angkat aku panggil sulaiman to come and check then all of a sudden kita tengok kat dalam dia punya mata kail kan betul-betul sangkut kat hidung
betul-betul on the nose
then the rest of the night tak ada ikan
kita jumpa dekat singapore so the the asal before kita jumpa sekeluarga
then dia datang naik grab bila dia claw grab ingat dia keluar gi bazaar ke apa
betul-betul keluar barang one by one ada claw back trolley besar satu bakul satu err bawa langsir
nak tukar langsir dekat dalam rumah dia then actually the next day more fun keluarga dia datang the next day dia nya extended relatives lah dia datang bawa tiga
connections lah kalau sebab kalau sulaimannya family yang dia punya extended family ni memang satu orang tu driver so kalau coincidentally dia dapat arrange with the driver senang lah tak payah bayar tambang free of charge
okay so kita dah sampai kampung sulaiman get everything ready six o'clock then salin baju semua
err that's what made me worried lah tengok dia dah pakai all full suit but I have nothing like am I supposed to prepare something on my end then terus
initially no intention tapi bila dah nampak sulaiman keluarkan joran tu the intention came out lah
six twenty five kita gerak then from there kita jalan all the way to that spot
we we actually walk all the way to this part of the dam ya actually macam where you get all the air keluar masuk then bila air pasang semua macam marina barrage lah and then you get on top of the stone then sulaiman cakap wan err ni part gerek tau bila high tide kita tak boleh keluar tau
kau kau nak tak abeh aku cakap go jer ah don't scared then betul-betul bila high tide eh terus sulaiman pointed at me wan tengok terus kita dah surrounded kiri kanan air pasang besar
then at first macam mula-mula tak boleh understand lah like the the depth of the air tapi bila air surut
once you see that low tide dia punya drop from the top of the dam to the bottom seram sia dua dua tingkat yes
so macam dari jauh tak nampak tapi betul-betul because of that that err concrete structure bila dah air tumpah bawah jatuh dalam seh
ya so basically macam this man-made structure is like very far away from the beach so there's this path yang kita kena jalan atas
then err ada from there is like a hill downwards lah so from there ada slope to err to bakau-bakau sini and after that we had to climb on certain bricks to get onto the structure so bila air pasang
the whole valley below semua ni semua covered so it's just us on this on this structure
so that time I think lucky lah sebab I think the tide was supposed to be three metres plus then the highest eh
betul-betul macam sini tau then dia cakap man kalau get any higher how aku cakap macam tu lah wan
takde there's no is open is basically your marina barrage bridge is basically the same logic as that thing
I think next time you go there confirm kau try juga high tide got stranded for like we were stranded for I think a good six hours six hours err because
air naik pasang baru pukul sepuluh but the coast too low then after that we were there until
pukul empat pukul empat dia dah naik sepuluh malam ya then after that pukul satu
tu apa was the highest then after that betul-betul tengok eh kita literally sia
macam tsunami betul-betul tengok bila air pasang air surut ombak dari luar masuk dalam
tak juga okay itu best okay this part censored sikit bila nak kencing kita ada satu spot
satu spot on the whole man-made structure kita technically I will consider this macam the north eastern part of it
away from the laut tapi towards the kampung
habis tu ada lah tengah rilek terus dengar ada kat belakang what what's that noise jangan pandang belakang oh
two three times because there's nothing much to do but sulaiman what he did most was he he makan some Pringles lah
okay so sulaiman dia dia tunjuk something this one is about naz yang recommend
dia ada satu backpack ni dia jadi tempat duduk
kirakan macam backpack punya the the sponge tu dia punya padding you can actually convert into a seat then after that sulaiman just duduk jer atas
but for my end ini tempat legend aku tak ada benda then um sulaiman punya mum cakap wan err kau tengok kau belakang ada ke tak
then I I I find this yang the simple basic students yang lipat yang buka tutup boat
so it was already like decomposing and then after that I just sat down and then kita testing dulu lah kat kampung tapi bila kita testing kan mesti nak kena fragile sikit tapi bila dah kat laut duduk sekejap aku ingat kayu yang raput tapi the whole boat collapsed
mana oh jelutong uh uh mm pulau ketam
dapat duit I don't know dapat joke the ikan
johan eh bukan ke
ikan johan ke I've heard ikan johan before dia macam ikan duri tapi besar
itu johan is like the middle leh it feels so weird
ikan duri apa tu jahat uh huh uh huh
I thought johan tu ikan keli besar pe oh
six duris so all the yang middle medium lah no jahans
that's why ah bento I wanna say jaring
net net lah jaring lah I'm just gonna say jaring or jala ah jala alright
ni pancing malam ke pagi overnight oh
ni COVID ke no
ah cause I thought the uncle was the one who bring you all the way right baiknya express
dah bayar lebih bawa lebih weh
mm mampus mampus
is it like the normal crabs or macam ketam-ketam bakar begitu
wah flower crabs yang kat pasar selalunya fuyoh the ones you get blue or brown
if blue if I'm not wrong is male tak ada telur ya brown usually is yang female lah
scary horror yes mampus okay carry on carry on
I wan two or wan three I wan three right mampus alright
orh pulau ubin juga okay okay
eh apa ni ah
tu lah mine mine I I wear arm sleeves you can't see but it's it's poking through lah poking through
but okay in terms of azan eh because this one also the same thing happened to me that time when I go with sulaiman but the the thing is uh not the spot but basically in the kampung melayu juga when we are back at home it was betul-betul subuh time lah
then when I was outside I thought like somebody was you know playing on the radio azan or quran
but then when I go outside I literally stand in the middle semua gelap I just stand in the middle and then I faced towards malaysia lah then I can really hear surau kat sana tengah playing eh tengah playing pula eh tengah tu lah tengah prepare tengah solat subuh
then for the first time macam the whole kampung betul-betul every subuh eh I think this one has to be like every day ah everyday in pulau ubin ada jer quran playing
so there's always quran throughout the whole island boleh dengar because kampung it's from malaysia lah you can hear from malaysia
so that means because because I think probably memang isolated then there's nothing to block except the trees then I can only suspect is the surau if I'm not mistaken is the masjid kampung pasir puteh
so white sands literally dekat malaysia ya then that masjid is when we look at the map
is quite close to by right the side so your area pulau ketam should hear it louder than kampung melayu
and ya lah so yang okay so yang pulau ketam is it the one that has this two storey building is that your spot
ya kenapa seh mana ada
tadi in the beginning I already say in the beginning in the beginning I already say a lot of malay so that's why right now I am trying my best to try to
campurkan melayu sikit with the english but when I try to put in the melayu I understand that I hesitate a bit jadi terkaku lah
habis bila dah focused then err then all the sentence everywhere
jadi kita try our best to not really mix everything lah cause that's that's against what they want us to do pe
ah yes ada kisahnya all
kalau dapat ke tak dapat bilang jer lah but instead you just keep the okay one of the things this one I can say lah because I think one month dah over pun
err I applied for this err safe distancing err ambassador at masjid omar salmah
so that one is the I think to me is the most saddest because it is the most yang kasi harapan because
when they called me I was at Sheng Siong and and then my they called the worst time cause I was supposed to pay but then they called me and then I answered the phone and my mum terpinga-pinga lah macam ni nak bayar ni
ya ya then for me I was err I just answer the call then cakap hi err assalamualaikum err err is this shazwan on the line
then I cakap ah yes may I know who is this dia cakap oh I am from masjid muhajirin mula-mula aku fikir aku apply masjid omar salmah asal why is it yang masjid muhajirin yang call
then I realise ah because err this thing is by right ada muhajirin but they need someone to err cover omar salmah so they called me everything then they asked to clarify certain parts of my resume
then aku explain to them lah yang okay aku ni dua puluh empat tahun
she ask the question tahu ke tak yang this place is very far very ulu ada transports sendiri ke tak then I said no but I've seen the map I can still walk there fifteen minutes lah
within the week so sekarang dah satu bulan
and there's still nothing so that's why I say this kind of thing eh like like at least bilang lah like don't keep the person waiting cause I was actually hopeful maybe
this is the rezeki I've been waiting for ya ke tak it's not it's not the one so that's why I'm like
err it's not it's tak baik lah tak baik
I think I think I think that one is the worst lah okay so to talk about sakit hati this one I don't know if if kita jaga aib ke tak jaga aib because it it it involves masjid juga
so so recently I I think for for for confidentiality I will not name the masjid
but I will say the proximity of the masjid the masjid is in the east so this masjid he surrounding dia has quite a few other masjids
yes so this is a part of singapore yang ada banyak masjid quite near each other ah if you knows what I'm talking about
ya but it's not the one that you probably think about is one of the masjid yang kat dalam-dalam sikit okay it's one it's definitely tak tak famous lah which is why lagi aku fed up
the whole story is yang mula-mula I got this call from this err person from I would say the communications department lah
kan so the communications department suddenly call me on monday afternoon saying um assalamualaikum shazwan err saya nik ni err
I understand from this person that you are helping us to design a poster so first of all in my mind siapa sia ni terus cakap since when am I helping to design a poster
for that time no because the way they say we have a deadline by wednesday is like err we are urgent lah urgent can you help us in my mind cakap
aku tak cakap benda I didn't I didn't want to be on board tapi the way you say macam kesian juga ini masjid
but the thing is that I don't like or don't agree on is that he just mentang-mentang kasi my
I did the poster so the poster was everything you know me lah my style is everything I do on Powerpoint then bila aku dah buat semua they they ask me
the first thing they asked is can you find the photos yourself of the of the asatizahs mentioned then aku fikir aku memang lah bukan orang alim
tapi who are these ustaz I don't know these ustaz what if I type the same ustaz and I put ustaz nama nama ustaz different person I wouldn't know also what
so that's why luckily I have this friend secondary school friend lah kita
aku minta tolong dia sebab dia pun by right macam orang masjid lah
and he he managed to provide me yang gambar-gambar betul lah so alhamdullilah so what I do is I just take the photos then I do the caricature lah basically it's just copy paste edit the shape
and make a cartoon version of the asatizah and the guest speaker so the guest speaker
yes so so that's why I say this masjidnya sebab apa
ada pula panggil fandi ahmad so I already did the design err I understand that the communications officer sebenarnya dia orang muda
so dia actually understand my style dia pun suka my style but of course kita akhirnya when it comes to all these things higher ups the final say then err
I think the the funniest argument is that one of the people on top say um aku rasa ada problem because I think later they are scared that because when it comes to this
so by right even for me lah when it comes to the hierarchy of such an event kita selalu moderator dulu you need a moderator to moderate then you have the speakers or your guests
so for me my logic is because of space constraint juga I put it in diagonal manner I put the moderator up here then the asatizahs together
and then I got fandi ahmad but the person who viewed this thing said err do you think it might be offensive to the asatizah that the moderator who is of lesser rank is higher
then in my mind aku fikir asatizah boleh fikir macam tu ke is that is that healthy for you to say eh aku lebih alim pe is that actually healthy sangat
but then he say but from left to right is the moderator is still first and then asatizah and then fandi ahmad would you think that the moderator because he is first in line he is of higher rank
that's why I say eh if I macam tu I I put circle pun you will find somewhere to start semua mesti salah punya right
we understand we know it's just that the higher ups refuse to listen ni yang susah orang tua tak nak dengar orang muda so the explanation is okay but I still feel ah that's it that's it so once that happens
err game lah so I I really at that time memang macam upset lah but the oh the final blow right is that yesterday
they they give it to the chairman chairman cakap okay okay go published Facebook Instagram published it was published I saw it
on Facebook and Instagram at eight dia pun bilang aku that timing and then after that the next day tiba-tiba the officer called me
that the pictures of asatizah are made into cartoons and then ya alah I fikir
but it's just is is is an effect I never made the nose bigger ke telinga besar ke is not I think but then the person that commented said it is offensive
to have the asatizah drawn as a cartoon then aku fikir balik ni macam kenapa nak terperinci sangat
ya so that's why in this situasi you can actually see
that orang tua is not very flexible they understand everything then
I really apologise for this thing um boleh tak
err kita delete all of your all of the drawings that you did and just put in the actual picture of the of the asatizah in my mind I was like
then the past three nights you asked me to make the last minute changes on the faces buat cantik-cantik bring it bigger make the font smaller
semua tu means nothing lah he say just delete everything just use the original photo can already
cakap we know of someone who can help us for free ah without consulting me or informing me at all
that is why bila aku dah tau dah find out who is the one responsible my Whatsapp was panas I literally texted
but only after I finished my poster I said err salam semua this is the poster that I have done
nanti tiba-tiba jer nama dah masuk dalam for benda-benda yang kita tak tahu pun apa nak kita nak buat
ah memang so so right now the thing is on that end the poster is still down is still taken down but
yang mereka masih persistent to make sure it's photos but I've already made it clear to the officer I'm sorry but I will not make any more changes because I feel disappointed I said it just just just blurt it out
and then the officer say I understand where you're coming from so I will still try my best to to err macam tukar err pemikiran orang-orang atas lah
cakap to understand that this doesn't this shouldn't offend people like how you think it will offend people because it's just
it's just a caricature tapi kita pun nak kena tengok logic tau the logic is the poster I did it because I I was informed of the age group
the age group was aimed for twelve to eighteen year olds kalau let's say you err
secondary school lah kau tengok gambar macam comic and gambar macam real mana satu yang kau macam more wah this one seems more interesting
so itu yang kelakar dia ni bahan lawak dia communication in the beginning pun tak kasi tau they never even inform me that I was supposed to do this thing
that's why I I I sound them all then betul-betul cakap I'm sorry I know I shouldn't have done this is it's unprofessional on my end I hope you may forgive me
then terpaksa lah kita forgive
tapi when they start saying oh by the way shazwan err can you just put the original picture ah that's it done I'm out thanks for nothing
because I mean to be fair juga lah if let's say you paid me and then I say this thing memang unprofessional of me because you already pay me but this part is that
you already say that I'm a volunteer know I mean I am forced ikhlas ke tak ikhlas so
that's the that's the sad part lah which is why it reminded me of the of the time yang dulu
kita ni kalau buat design ni freelance never do for free
mm itu lah
so that's why like when it comes to people always asking the designers to make changes macam for them is so easy that's why like
even for me there's always that moment cakap kalau senang senang kau buat lah sendiri what you mean so easy do yourself
itu lah that's why that's why even for me that's why I don't do freelance job because of this simple fact when you say I like it but can you no
then okay itu lah kadang-kadang kita fikir balik manusia ni semua menyakitkan hati
err even for you err folks over there that is listening in that is tuning into our err podcast terima kasih
kerana sudi mendengar kita err dah tak ada cerita cerita tu ada sebenarnya everything has been a true story believe it or not
ya lah tadi sebelum ni kita pergi bubble tea we we went to the bubble tea shop we went to we went to buy so just now like the initial story on the topic of
pelik lah but you know for the benefit of your program the thing that you are trying to do kita kita sudi tolong
sudikan masa kita pada malam sabtu ni untuk err tolong ah which is interesting because in english we say friday night tapi kalau like in in malay
err malam jumaat malam jumaat is thursday so the logic eh if you you if you're curious is that sebab kita
so maghrib is when we start our day so that's why for hari raya ah if you are also curious why we don't err fast
on the last day eh sorry why we don't pray on yang malam terakhir itu is because only hari raya
ya now dah start merepek tapi tu lah kalau kita asyik berbual for forty eight minutes straight kan these things will pop up I'm pretty sure we are not the only
err people the only participants yang err bual benda-benda merepek especially towards the the later part of this err
podcast err I wanted to say project which is the thing lah but for us we gonna treat it as podcast already lah kita betul-betul tak tahu nak bual apa lah kan
ada lah got lah got okay alright
muka selamba eh cakap one thousand
gitu gitu tak apa ah thank you it's okay
fikir mana eh want to be prime minister tak apa it's okay
okay tak apa
typical jer ada kau kita pergi tak ada kau kita potong
aduh terima kasih lah sekarang kita tinggal cuma lapan minute jadi in this final eight minutes kita boleh doa sekarang
buat it slow lah nak panjang ke nak pendek ah
when it comes to the next steps we need to know what's the next step if it's a little bit too much takpe thank you
should be okay lah because you wanted singlish singlish is basically err orang bangsa macam-macam bual bahasa macam-macam together rojak and then that's that's our language our pride and honour
pride kita tak boleh record lagi lah dah tutup
jadi six minutes yes
uh pasal apa pula Grab oh okay jap oh jap
mm mm lapan puluh eh macam tu cepat
and this one we will cover in two minutes don't worry this one is I went for the hike to from my house aku jalan kaki guess to where
apa kamu cakap change the last part again yes
aku pun tak tahu berapa click basically that then go down marina barrage gardens by the bay marina bay sands five one eight balik rumah tidur
I usually go out at five asar five sampai balik rumah nine thirty
eh you underestimate my stamina ke brother I walk from from my house to east coast one hour
five tapi kau nak ke
park your motor at marina bay sands and then you take the downtown line ah downtown line to here okay jom then after you send me back home
actually kan aku tak because uh mak aku like whenever she cook she will buka the YouTube punya
apa tu video ya because dia tak ada Spotify so she will use the YouTube ah while she cook
tapi macam a bit merepek cause last time can misteri jam dua belas kat radio kan so you listen to it at night literally before twelve but ni dia tengok bila tengah macam petang cause tengah masak kan you had any stories on your
kau kau dengar
ya ya the when one yang you were studying at home kan
aku aku weh pun nak dengar ah
keras kan ya
how sia because that time I I didn't know how keras it was until I came aku balik lambat that time because the the tempat that I live kan is betul-betul opposite the
benda-benda tu the and the muslim world
and then dia macam dalam tau sebelah ha the best part tempat aku tinggal is betul-betul sebelah fuchun primary
no no the one that I'm staying in sekarang ya
aku tak tahu aku tahu dia marsiling
the one yang opposite the tu
the the police dengan muslim world
tak ah yours is dalam lagi sikit
ya sebab tu yang tadi pagi yang aku
bangun masa extra awal lah cause I thought it was late but the the bus stop is literally dekat depan like depan block ah so I took
nine six six direct straight all the way pergi I'm like ah I came here within forty five minutes
ya but it's only untuk tiga minggu jer
entah I don't know my parents my family is living there like we just take a rental
ya so after the three weeks then kita boleh masuk the new house lah
ya ya ya betul-betul next to ya fuchun section primary so I think it's the new one ya by tak tu kat
ya tu aku tu aku tak berani because the next bus kan yang pass by that tempat ya I saw like oh
ya I'm like okay tak apa aku tak nak pergi sini
macam mana kau masuk the sekolah like is it they give you
like is it like macam kalau secondary school kan like dia orang kasi like that booklet kan untuk uh like you can either apply directly atau you go through the system kan then for primary apa like kau apply directly or
kau fikir ni TOTO ke apa
that one aku tak tahu ah because their
so that's what your what your parents bid ah ya but ya and hantu
mmhmm kau primary school ada cadet
apa seh tu korang kena belajar history
huh founder kat singapore
ya betul lah ya
asal oh okay
because my school punya like very limited so dia orang cuma ada like sports
uh apa lagi eh
I think that's about it and then when bila aku baru nak graduate then dia offered arts
so like dari like from primary school uh I was in track and field uh apa nama benda tu tak tak it's not netball
aku tengok home econs aku macam apa kau orang belajar kat sini ya they learn how to cook there was a competition for cooking
home econs belajar apa
oh aku dengar for like for the exam you literally have to cook
like oops tak apa darurat
oh no they say like kalau ha you can it's like god purposely let you makan because ya five minutes
I never studied music so bila aku kat poly kan
because in poly I joined the percussion punya band
and then there was this one part of the test where the instructor ajar kita orang how to read music tapi aku lost gila ya
aku lost because like he was teaching us like paradiddle ke apa entah how to do the how to keep how to macam ha stay in beat and listen to the rhythm ke apa because our instructor tu was from yuhua punya like some band thing ah
aku just lost so dia macam we had to pass the test and we had to learn how to draw the symbols semua a'ah
okay lah aku aku pass the paper lah but the actual practical aku macam huh
dengan flute kan tak eh
oh oh that's recorder oh aku teringat squidward clarinet
tu bukan gong lah merepek
the what rebana
oh that one is like dia macam xylophone gitu kan it's something like that lah tapi dia like circle circle
but ya kau jadi apa malay dance
fusion macam mana kau joget sia
handball aku tak tahu uh huh
actually lah at first macam macam malas kan but then after awhile then you're like okay
camp qiam ah
uh I think ada lah because we had this program in primary six yang eh kaki kau ada semut
uh and then apa tu that one kita it's like uh like you know those masa adam khoo punya camps
everytime ada camp kan mesti ada that night walk tau ya and then before night walk they will always show you cerita hantu tau atau cerita seram before that so for that for that one they showed us uh movie the orphan I think
honestly aku tak ingat because
it was quite scary because the sekolah that we had to go was wak tanjong ya then wak tanjong kan it's like
macam kampung lama right I think it was like rumah orang ah dulu
ya then so macam we had to crawl over stuff and benda semua tapi aku mesti teringat mesti ada hantu kat sini something like haunted house ah ya
mm then dia orang cakap ah macam if kalau if you see anything uh you try to find the
facilitator ah because they have a glow stick I'm like habis kalau facilitator benda lain macam mana
oo yang army I think the first episode ke second episode
oh ah yang bila dia baru masuk eh habis dia kena bully kan cause mak dia hantar dia a'ah
tu kat tekong eh tak eh kat mana seh
oh macam apa tu like ha caterpillar baru nak cakap train
so korang apa masuk alam bunian
ya is it korang like got trapped
in the tempat eh
macam dah nak siap to tidur ah
ya korang you take some time lah ya
tak which makes me think sebab sebab like kau tahu nak cakap bugis kan ada this tempat where
uh that road is called uh jalan kubur
ya basically sebelah aljunied right so like the entire stretch semua kubur tau and then it's very like rapat-rapat
it's literally next to the madrasah it's the I think the the founder of the sekolah punya family aljunied ya
oh because that used to be dia punya tempat ah like is it like the ha the tanah or the kampung where most of them tinggal kat situ ah
aku macam no because aku baru perasan kan because that time I I was going home and then aku nak pergi bus stop then so I went to the bus stop
literally belakang bus stop tu so macam
sini ada kubur-kubur then bus stop kat sini so kalau kau nak pergi bus stop you have to pass by the kubur ah
I didn't I was like how can it be that close seh tak seram ke
and macam I
ya is it dia orang tak perasan ke dia orang tak kesah
oh yang tu lah
tak seram seh because when I went to the bus stop it was dah malam
and then aku macam it was very like seram ah aku just tengah jalan minding my own business and then pergi bus stop aku nak cari bus and aku tengok tepi I was like eh kubur
kena culik eh
kenapa bau bau bangkai eh
ke just bau tanah like fertiliser
kat luar kan bye
asal eh is it dia punya no no no as in the tempat tempat mandi dia is like covered eh or is it like open air oh so kirakan dia just macam panel lah
it's a kolah right
ya tak comfortable lah
is it a real thing though it's not right I heard like it's orang eh
is it someone hantar jin or is it orang tu sendiri is the one
the what oh they send benda tu ah
actually kan aku ada question we're because hantu raya kan dia actually apa
what is it asal why is it called raya
ya which reminds me of the incredible tales because ada this one episode where
ada this group of students dia pergi this one area kat
I think indonesia and then while they were going up to the tempat kan
uh they dia orang
I don't know if it's a bomoh but I think and then she macam advice dia orang kan dia dia she advise them about the macam pantang larang gitu and then
a'ah yang tu yang tu ha ya
apa eh oh they they call it
nananggal tak salah
no no they the it's nananggal not penanggal
eh aku tak tahu ah cause oh
oh apa they malay peninsular so sama hantu lah
it's because when I first saw it kan oh chey okay no because I thought at first it's a pontianak but then the cerita tunjukkan kan because the girl was pregnant then she hit the fact from the other friends
ya kat singapore
aku tak pernah nampak okay okay then
which makes me wonder tau because kan dia orang patut kan they can go through
like solid objects tak boleh affect them kan tapi they get stuck
oh amal pengamal oo
tu yang aku tak faham like you would take you would pay lots of money
to apa tu get the services of
like jin dengan bomoh tapi like benda surgery kau tak nak
ya apa yang natural it's supernatural
seram ah wait then what's the purpose of the penanggal like
I know oh the I don't know what's the purpose tapi aku tahu like dekat episode tu they show
um that thing was going after the perempuan yang pregnant
I know because like one reasons is because macam like they are more vulnerable and then they are macam mana eh
like they are more vulnerable because they ada benda yang orang lain nak tapi tak tak ada tak dapat
so they try to like steal it from them which is apa tu the baby lah it's like new life
a'ah ya ya ada ada
I mean kita dah berbual pasal ayat lain semua
ya itu that one just
because they they either makan the anak atau they curi the anak atau they ikat the rahim eww
ya like finally I know what's the purpose of that eh dia letak garam kan tak eh garam
ya aku dengar like if you letak garam kat luar your pintu kan macam anyone ha anyone who masuk rumah kalau dia ada simpan benda kan that benda cannot masuk rumah
maybe ah it's one of the ways ah yang ada
sirih eh
apa seh aku tak pernah dengar is it melayu punya
apa seh
oh kirakan macam
they make it into a sabun kan so senang
sambut what do you mean
eh a'ah a'ah apa tu yang the son of a peach punya cerita kan they were saying macam this hospital dia cakap
uh dia tengah beranak kan and then she saw a white figure then the nurse cakap oh that one is normal usually when people give birth they always see that figure
so kirakan macam kalau like you give birth
but then someone benda lain might be
cause thinking macam sebab maternity work kan like babies baru keluar
so it's seram seh but then kalau macam you are if you are in the operating room kan and then kau baru give birth you know that the doctor is the one that's taking you right
oh that's why that one macam make sure kalau kau kat dalam kan you have someone like your family there so they can ha okay okay
oh but then masih baru kan the
oh ya ya ya tidur mati ah
kau tak baca doa tidur eh asal eh
oo so if it wakes you up then different story ah ha bodoh lah
but apa yang dia call it apa err it's not khayalan it's like
ya betul
the he looked up the stuff kan then he saw that actually jin dengan you cannot see jin and syaitan because they are in a different dimension ya so
ya so what happens is that because kau kena apa tu hasut kan
macam is just playing in your head so the syaitan hasut you and then kirakan they like they are the ones that showing you these images in your head but actually you cannot see them because if you can see if you can see them means you can see the entire dimension tau everything that exist in that dimension
ya macam that's why macam you nampak benda tapi orang lain tak nampak kan ya
also orang lain yang kena ah
kau pergi jahit malam-malam apa cerita okay
wait so that's one of the ways they kacau you ah
so kirakan dia orang actually pegang kau or they just make you think that ada orang pegang kau
ha dia orang selalu buat kan macam like those supernatural punya like
ya I remember I watched the one yang kat malaysia kan where they the the whole entire team
kat luar rumah and then they will send someone into the one of the rooms and then the person will be lying on the ground
and then like baca-baca something basically like inviting the hantu gitu ah
ya but then it's like damn scary because apa tu
like the the thing will come to them right and then apa tu
macam mana eh the the pintu semua gerak and then they will see like lights and then they will hear sounds and everything
and then and then the person will like try to exit to go back to dia punya the team outside right
like usually when they go out they we have like a a bomoh on standby gitu ya
and then when they go until they will like it it's always like dia orang macam trembling or shivering or they say like dia orang ada rasa benda
ya why ah is it like singapore like dia orang tak kacau sangat
so you telling me that the hantu also like shifted back to the kampung then oh it became less popular eh less demand
oh I think it's because like is it like people in singapore tak practise as much as those
and also because like we don't have much of the resources juga ah ya really like maybe ada memang ada lah but like
and like the pantang larang for bomoh right is more
ya it's so leceh satu and then it's like for the rest of your life or for as long as you are using it kan but for if you go for plastic surgery it's like
like kan dia cakap tak boleh you cannot walk under the galah but then kat kampung dulu dia orang pakai galah kot
I I thought they use the clothes line the string tak eh
and kenapa galah like aku aku tak faham huh what's that
properties ah then what if it's made out of metal atau plastic
no bila macam those extendable galah kan that one made of metal what no meh
like you will perah the thing first what before you gantung
kau tau jemur ke apa ya
so kirakan like when you absent-mindedly walked under the galah lah ha
what's eh wait but for susuk kalau terkeluar you can just masukkan balik kan
it's macam mana eh it's it's this actual peniti kan something like that
I know like there used to be this show dekat suria where
where they show no not cerita hantu it's
err they ya ya so one of it is susuk they show like how the bomoh will masukkan the susuk then they will like oh it's sakit sikit tau so they masukkan
and then like if kalau kau histeria kan you can see the needles in your face
but then macam but they say like kalau the person who the person who masukkan
is the only person who can keluarkan
is it so if like ya unless unless if you go under the galah and then dia jatuh sendiri ah
it's either you cannot die or cause susah nak mati like the nazak right
but tetap can die lah so okay ah
because if you cannot die ah habis suffer like that
so tak mati ah oh take it out
the kafan and everything
ya but it's like you tangan semua
bodoh sejuk siol
dah lah tak tak pakai stokin
wait so they don't they don't bury you with kain batik kain batik is before kan
the funeral right oh chey ya so kiranya bila masuk kau keluarkan dari batik ah
nasi lemak oh tak ah no no no because kan
kalau kau dah keluarkan the
batik kan would you want to still use the batik
atau like the the the soil wouldn't stay right ya
err she said like ni orang-orang dulu kata ah macam if you are at the funeral kan jangan diri depan kaki mayat because in case kalau bukan-bukan kalau like the person pernah ada simpan barang kan they might pass it to you ya so don't like stand I don't know how true this is ah but
ya but I thought like kalau
so if like they ask you ya that's what I thought ah my mum you supposed to pass the thing bila dia masa hidup kan not bila dah mati
no as in the roof is what boleh buka oh okay okay okay
oh my god my mum like the interview she said like uh she would work right and then she would take leave then when her ask when her friends asked her like eh you took leave where you go the she said I won't go I'm gonna stay home and gosok baju and then aku macam ya she did I was like then what do you do for fun no lah I just stay home ah if my friends invite me maybe we go
like watch movie or what but after that I come back home I take leave so that I can wash everyone's clothes at home lah gosok baju semua because ya
ya and then like it's not like dua tiga orang tau like in the house there's like ten plus people I'm like why
that's great sorry uh I didn't hear you just now you were saying uh you buat apa sekarang
oh eh ah ah eh like why why would you participate kalau you indonesian sorry
indonesian I see uh freelance tu kat mana
like how how do you find the freelance job macam mana
oh that's that's great because um actually macam kalau I pun tengah cari-cari kerja lah sebab um recently I just quit my job because of ya ya because of some um apa kesihatan ah related to kesihatan um ethics so macam I not quit lah I taking a break so but I tak tahu I nak continue ke tak
ya so I'm I'm looking for jobs to so macam that's interesting um maybe I can like to try to look uh look for this kind of jobs too
ah ah like I I feel like I woke up everyday like macam rasa tak happy gitu seh like nak pergi kerja alamak
hmm so like uh as of now I I tak tahu if like it's not my passion or like it's not it's not my rezeki or what because I really feel like uh I used to really passionate about this tapi macam sekarang macam dah malas nak pergi then macam really tak tahu lah if I should continue or not but like now I'm taking like maybe two months break
oh okay so what like sekarang like what line you you at like uh what industry
ya but I pun macam not really um into it yet macam how how do I say it macam dulu I
baru jer baru jer because
ya I baru graduate uh last year as in actually this year lah the apa tu during the period actually suppose to have our um ceremony kan tapi tak boleh ya so I'm the unlucky batch
ya um ya so um I I got into an internship dia ajar bukan ajar lah tapi macam it's speech and drama so I um my course actually applied drama and psychology uh so macam my interest is more to theater and stuff ya they macam post me to uh this early childhood not early childhood lah tapi macam like somewhat macam budak-budak dia macam actually interested uh tapi I got confuse I think I more interested in the uh in the drama side instead of teaching budak-budak
when I was in internship oh uh so pagi kita okay uh so the internship place is actually at enrichment centre so pagi uh tak ada apa-apa it's just admin job then the admin job pun macam like tak susah sangat lah I mean like it was difficult because halfway kita punya supervisor then like a lot of teachers left in uh the company because of some things happen uh then uh so that's why the intern had a lot a lot more jobs to do in the morning but then like afternoon then baru macam kalau ada budak-budak datang for class kan then we are just I'm the teacher's assistant then the teacher assistant just uh tolong the teacher to just hype the class nanti kalau cikgu dia cakap something funny then we're just like uh apa tu oh my god isn't it funny like that kind of thing lah macam stupid gitu tapi macam
ya it's like to encourage them to macam speak up macam do do the drama with them macam we will have like um dramas uh drama train which will bring them to the drama drama island then in that drama island the teacher will be in another role
ya so like now I tak tahu if I nak sambung kerja dengan budak-budak or like I I'm just interested in the dramas side
um actually it's not like allow allow not like dia orang suka-suka nak allow but it's like um it's a bit unethical for me to work there also lah because like err I've been having macam low moods and stuff so macam kesian the budak-budak lah
hmm I honestly tak tahu seh because like because right now that's a lot of thing that happening so macam I I tak tahu if it's because of my um my job only or is it because of my whatever that is happening in my life that contributes to how I feel right now that's why I'm um but I I came clean to my boss like I bilang dia uh whatever that's been happening in my life then she say lah macam uh I don't think you're you're capable of working now so macam I need to macam set my head straight lah uh maybe I need to seek for help I go to seek for help first and stuff just make sure when you come back you feel macam hundred percent here lah because like right now you're a like everywhere
and that's a big decision to make seh because like um it can affect your future if you stay here not happy then macam in the future like kalau lambat then you it's hard for you to change but now macam is the time um for us to macam explore but it's like exploring also is so difficult when you don't have anything to follow I feel
ah tu lah
ya unless kalau kita kerja part time yang macam um temperature taking gitu semua I mean it's it's okay lah macam good ya it's better than nothing tapi macam the thing is ah I'm just worried macam this is just macam just graduate kan so macam I think too much about stuff then um if I take that kind of job now then macam I don't have like much experience in like uh what I want to do in the future dia macam I scared macam I'm not prepared lah but this is just me overthinking lah but um if dapat dapat kerja the temperature taking pun macam bersyukur seh as of now
berapa lama the the webinar
wow that's really good because like actually um when I joined the company the one that I'm taking a break now I actually suppose to go for a class to macam a diploma conversion ya so but then um for now obviously cannot uh go to the school lah the tapi nanti if like the situation gets better than we have to go to go back to the school so macam um I I don't know I feel like macam its a bit more demanding in a way macam and like I don't think we are allowed to do whatever we want I think we need to sit in like our house and like you know like just just sit macam focused on like just real school
oh no uh it's not uh teaching the kids at home but err apa itu it's just like normal school macam we learn about how to teach the kids at home but then in the morning baru kita teach the kids at school get it so from eight to eight two um one we teach the kids at school real kids then balik then err the teacher that lecturer will teach us pula on like about kid
um honestly I feel like a bit macam I don't know because I I didn't go for it yet kan macam I stopped before it started today was supposed to be the first time day first day work at the start of the class tapi um from what I think ah macam it depends on the company you work with kalau the company macam give you a lot of uh things to do like homework macam preparing worksheets for the kids tu semua they don't have like a proper system like tak ada macam mana eh they tak ada their own worksheet for us to just photocopy we have to make all the worksheet so macam it's that already a a lot of workload then kita pergi sekolah we have also we also have our assignment and like test tu semua ya so it's like it's a bit macam scary kan
ya I feel I felt that way lah then macam that's why I felt really macam um I'm scared like I I had I had a meltdown semua
um I think they because there's only one that just uh finish the diploma conversion then she's she also said macam is going to be difficult lah sebab um the tempat kerja even weekend sometimes the boss I think macam she didn't like intentionally do this tapi macam just to macam she will like text us during the weekends macam to tell us need to do this this this so macam um my colleague yang just finish the diploma dia cakap ah it's a bit more demanding from the company itself then macam we we also have the our stuff to do so macam she she felt like it's a bit difficult lah to go through
that so macam she she was concerned about me lah because like she she knew that uh it's going to be tough for me and especially now kan um that's not enough teacher the card the company so so macam there's a lot of macam pressure on on the new teachers macam kita not teachers lah macam supposedly I'm not supposed to teach kan so macam they try their best not to macam expect do ask me to do a lot of stuff because I'm just program helper tapi macam sometimes nak tak nak macam takkan lah nak biarkan the company to drown kan like if you see this that you need to help obviously you need to do it ya macam that's why macam she say it will be early will be more tough on me lah because everything is new then nak kena belajar nak kena adapt to the changes then like uh nak kena apa belajar lagi
but then like okay so why why macam I'm stressing myself kan like I agree with you macam since since secondary school I already told myself macam kalau tak happy like there's no point of doing it like as long as I'm happy then I will continue then um but then now kan macam I know okay deep down I I didn't tell anyone lah tapi macam I know deep down that I'm not happy with working with children now then but then macam I takut because I didn't have any other choice as of now like I haven't explore other than theatre tapi kat singapore theatre is not really like appreciated and especially during this nak buat theatre macam mana kan like there's no audience but I know there's some like macam virtual and stuff but then macam virtual I feel like if you are already in already in one theatre company and then obviously err you it's easier for you to um
uh to stay there lah macam to continue from where you are tapi macam kalau you are not in the theatre company then macam susah nak dapat nak ada audition pun tak ada
early childhood um the thing is like for early childhood kan macam I tak ada um much experience other than my internship internship ya so err I and I also my diploma is not early childhood diploma is applied drama and psychology so ya so I feel like um there's not much of got there's not many companies that would accept me then
ya the conversion is err is err the company itself yang I am in right now is actually macam they want they want new teachers to come in and it the boss also say that um she tak ini ah tak expect us to stay very long she just uh provide a platform for a like a stepping stone gitu so macam she she encourages people to ya she macam looking for people who wants to become a new teacher there
ya so ya then the the the theatre thing macam I know deep down that I am interested in theatre lah to I want to macam act again and stuff tapi macam I know in singapore tak boleh kan so much that's the pressure lah ya I want to do theatre tapi macam I know it's going to be difficult on the finance like financially then
uh for like kalau I nak buat early childhood then I don't feel that happy so but then macam and early childhood is not bad the the pay kan especially in singapore because they need people but then like um and like if I don't continue for early childhood I macam I just feel like my mum is not really supportive of me to quit lah honestly
ya it's it's not difficult it's like macam average lah tapi jap eh my mum my mum is like texting me
that's that's sweet because like my mom dia macam passive aggressive tak tahu nak cakap macam mana it's like ya she macam I um because dari kecil we don't really macam um not very affectionate we are macam okay ya so macam kalau nak cakap dengan dia a bit awkward macam nak open up pun a bit awkward
then macam every time macam dari kecil I nangis about like oh my friend don't want to friend me all kind of things in primary school then she will be like you you go to school to to study not to to make friends so macam like she taught me to be tough lah macam like err emotions she put away emotions tu so macam sekarang I sedih I marah or like anything lah then I cannot like go to her to talk about things lah then macam I try my best walaupun dia macam push or try to avoid the emotion kan I will just like
try my best to explain to her lah macam what I'm feeling this way because this this this tapi then but I will text her I I cannot talk to her face to face because every time I cakap face to face she will macam like um suddenly become very cold then macam don't want to make eye contact then she will just say things macam err err if you cannot do it then I cannot force you macam that kind of stuff you know so macam I know that she's not happy but at the same time like she's trying her best to not macam put any pressure on me but macam that itself already made me err pressurize ya
huh err err I I have seniors but then macam I don't really talk to them macam I really never never like try before because like I in the back of my mind I already told myself like I don't want to start if I start then like I scared like I'm stuck there macam I don't want to stop ya
ya so macam I go for the safest uh option first which is the early childhood lah then macam but the thing is like I know deep down I am not happy with it tapi macam kalau I nak go out of it I'm like I don't know where to go you know like I don't have any interest in anything else other than early childhood or theatre then macam
and also I'm thinking about because I have a boyfriend now then like his family a bit well off lah I would I would say so macam if like I don't have any this is just me lah err if I don't have any macam um any education or like any specific job in mind I scared macam like not good enough you know this is kan
ya so um ya lah so macam uh as of now he keep on saying macam don't worry don't worry tapi macam you know like at certain extent you have to worry because like um that is your family obviously you say don't worry ya
mm mm ya so like sekarang I I don't know if I'm doing the right thing lah because um it was a hard decision for me to make to like uh stop whatever I was doing like I totally like left the company um not preparing any anything for them macam macam very abruptly lah the I didn't even like a complete the worksheet for them or anything but they my colleague yang ah the one that just went through the conversion she macam very quite helpful lah she macam keep on saying oh it's okay it's okay she will do it because also like my partner somewhat err ya we teaching the we we you macam assisting the same class
hmm hmm but I didn't I didn't really have a good rapport with her before this because we were teaching assisting um the the same level kan so macam I was err more of the art and craft and maths but she's more of the language so macam uh craft obviously have a lot more to more to prepare tu semua kan
then like um the the thing is they they have this thing in the company macam kalau craft teacher dengan language teacher have to work together to prepare the craft materials
but then I think she didn't she didn't get that err idea so macam most of the time I was doing the craft then macam balik pun I buat craft weekends pun I buat craft so macam like it was really a lot of stress for me lah ya then err macam I macam I that point of time geram dengan dia lah macam uh dia keep on saying macam oh I'll do it I'll do it tapi end up tak buat so I macam pressured lah because I'm the one who carry out the craft lesson kan macam the one
ya so macam it was really really irritating then sampai like um the colleagues uh ah my other colleagues we very small company lah so macam they they saw me struggling gitu macam everyday I supposed to go home at one thirty like my contract ends at one thirty but then err I my contract pula my timing ends at one thirty ah but then like the the full time teachers ends at three three thirty gitu tapi my my timing kan I'm always there until four until three so macam
no no that's that's the thing so the company macam we already say in the contract so macam it ends at one thirty but whatever materials you have to do is your own time own target so macam ya that sucks lah that's macam that's why I feel like macam kalau I continue to work and go for school the conversion confirm rabak
ya it's a it's a proper diploma so um if you have a diploma already but then you want to to macam decided to go for early childhood industry kan so you can apply at an at and then err and will consider ah macam but most of the time they will they will accept you ah because macam tak banyak in singapore wants to do early childhood
ya tak I don't think is lah because like um it this is there's a stereotype of like err early childhood teachers gets a lot of because um there's they really need early childhood teachers preschool teachers because that tak banyak in singapore nak buat
then um if the company also want to sponsor you then like you apply for the and then you see then you say lah the company wants to sponsor you then um they will consider you if you fulfill the the requirements so macam diploma tu semua macam uh your O level english tu semua and then err they will contact you lah eh but there's only like two two openings every year if I'm not wrong there's one in in april ya april and um october
uh I right now I don't know if I want to continue lah because like after talking to you then macam like really make me realize macam ya I should just macam do things that made me happy because like there's no point of doing getting money getting good money if I'm not happy like how long will that last
um that's that's good but then like um that's I used to have savings um before before joining the company kan and then like but the thing is I I thought I was going for the diploma conversion right so I my laptop rosak so I decided to buy a new laptop lah so because I was thinking okay with the pay that I'm getting then macam the laptop won't be so much lah and I also look for a cheap laptop not like macam one thousand plus gitu ah
it's just like six hundred seven hundred then um after I got the laptop so macam my savings to terjejas like affected already then then like err when I join the company then I got the pay already right then macam okay lah my first pay so macam I belanja my my family to eat tu semua then like my boyfriend leaving so macam I help him with um err not help him macam like I give him as a gift to semua macam barang-barang for but not everything lah within just a few then macam I didn't expect this to happen like I didn't expect that myself will like um broke macam mentally broke broken
ya as in like mentally broken so like um I I didn't expect things to happen then macam my savings pun now like terjejas my laptop like I'm not really using my laptop that much then macam I really feel macam everything is just
it's just cubaan now lah
ya but like I like mention ah I tak tahu if I want to continue with early childhood or not and also like I feel it's a bit unfair if I go for another early childhood company but I never tell my my err my boss that I don't want to work with her anymore
um so but a bit too macam you know so that people don't just terminate contracts suka hati ya so but I I brought it up to her lah about my situation tu semua but she quite understanding she say macam the six thousand dollar it's just for for formality lah it's not really macam to force to force you to pay or what
so macam she just macam let err let me uh apa tu not pay it eh not pay her and just macam take a break first but like err she say if I feel better then I can I can continue working with her lah but then macam as of now I kinda have this feeling that I won't continue with her lah because really make
err I I don't think so I I ya that's good but at the same time macam I feel the guilt lah because I told her that I want to continue working but like um I for now I cannot continue first I regret for saying that lah honestly because like at that point of time I really you macam have a lot in mind so macam I tell her stuff that I macam regret now
I I don't know why I as of now I really macam feel like everything is err falling apart lah because um ya lah because of the job then until I don't know if I want to continue then about my health also I'm not really stable right now then um my my boyfriend I mention him right then he just left for his yesterday I mean he's just it's just tapi macam I had a past of like my err my father's death so macam it kind of like triggered me lah just macam ya that's what I'm thinking so like um he him leaving my changes trigger everything lah so err I'm feeling like really really macam at my lowest right now lah ya so macam I feel sekarang
ya so I don't know what to do right you know that's why macam I'm supposed to take a break during tapi macam my mind just doesn't want to take a break you know you to keep on working macam why am I gonna do what am I gonna do but then macam I need to macam ya so macam I don't know I'm really lost right now lah so I'm trying my best to macam look for freelance work from home kind of thing
and segan kind also ya understood
okay is it is it the connection the the wifi but I think my wifi ada something wrong gitu cause macam I can but then macam like very dubbing
then ya lah I I I understand why what you mean by macam um you shy to ask questions like for me it's not like really I'm shy because I mean I'm in I'm from drama so I'm quite like okay with talking to people but like the thing is um I overthink a lot lah so macam when people macam just hesitant to say something then I will straightaway think oh I'm asking too much and like I'm troubling her or him macam I will start to to question myself lah macam like am I am I like menyusahkan or not that kind of things that's why like I don't really wanna talk not because like um I ya lah sombong or what but ya I I think it's it will be great talking to someone err especially like someone that I don't know so macam I don't really have macam anything to lose so if that sounds bad but then but then macam ya
ya I I think it will help definitely sikit ke banyak still help thank you so much but I just want I just want to say that I I'm really like amazed at how macam you're doing it for your own good it's like you you boleh make that decision you know of like um taking a break and like exploring new things like I I don't know if I were ever have the courage to do that
so it's like I I'm glad like even if or even that I just graduated I masih macam like in the past as they have this macam um want to like put uh put some into my savings so like now macam even though it's very little but I still them don't feel like I totally broke you know ya
so macam oh but oh my god can I just rant I mean like we just met but but I just macam nak lepaskan anger gitu because like I'm so annoyed because err so this month punya pay right I didn't know that my because like in the contract it says that I I can get a few few days seven days so macam every time this month it's just very unlucky for me lah I got food poisoning lah I got like macam selesema lah because there has been like cold uh cold bug around the school so err then I got it also then I also macam ada panic attack in one of the night because I ingat I injured my neck so macam this month I took a lot of thinking that macam you can like I can claim from their lah then rupanya they cut cut it off from my from my gaji then because like err I still macam baru kerja situ it's still not three months yet something like that lah so macam they ya but she
ya but she didn't tell me my boss didn't tell me that is like I I heard macam from my I'm not I don't know lah I I know I heard it somewhere that there's no probation or anything so macam and that's why I thought macam um we I already macam can claim the or what she also never say anything about it then after on like my second last day baru like I she mentioned ah about macam oh I took too much too many in one month like if I'm in another company definitely they will let me go and stuff so macam uh
ya but like at that point of time I already like giving her a lot of trouble you know so macam macam dah bagus dia tak suruh bayar enam enam apa enam ribu kan
err ya lah doesn't tapi sekarang macam I just feel a lot of guilt err towards the company so macam I tak tahu if I want to bring it up or not ah because err then okay there's a there's a continuation to that then macam they cutting from my gaji kan so macam I already had in mind okay my gaji month will be like a bit less but it's okay you can still sustain me for like one month then I can find like part time job and then I uh apa tu when I terminate the contract means I'm not continuing the the diploma they rupanya they will like macam will not get a refund if I apa tu err discontinue my diploma conversion in less than fourteen days
so the the company will have to pay will still have to pay around four hundred gitu so macam my gaji dah kurang then like my the the company has to pay four hundred which means I have to pay kan obviously the company won't ask won't macam want to pay for no reason so like I think my my pay will be like less than half you know this month then macam aduh sedih gila seh
like like I said lah that's why macam I I'm really free feel like this is my lowest point of life um because like money wise then macam like um my boyfriend left for rasa macam got triggered by my past then like my mom is like not really that supportive that much so it's like really lah what's the everything is just falling apart
I have kakak but then like she she move out already because she nikah
hmm two actually but um my I'm not close to my eldest one because uh she we lain mak
I think I for now I should just find jobs that's like um that won't bring that I won't bring it back home macam buat kerja kat situ then balik tak buat apa-apa
macam kalau penat penat kat kerja jer
I mean other than like there's um part time like macam F&B gitu lah guess can can do that tapi macam I don't know I kind of I'm not um I I have this need of like expressing my thoughts so like I don't think macam I can uh I can stay in can do that kind of part time but macam if there's no choice then I don't mind trying also now
organization so they are actually under macam they are more they work more with community instead of err kan kalau like you are the patient kan ya so much as chat is like you are the client as in different different fee lah macam like you just macam go there they already they give a free mental health assessment actually
ya but then like from there then um macam they will tell you lah or you you might need macam counselling or what then macam they will refer you to them lah me err I think if with them then can get a bit of subsidy ah I'm not so sure about that but then macam um because yesterday when they told me about the the err what I can do next then macam rate of like err what the next thing then we just counselling lah macam is forty dollars per session so like I think it's quite okay but
err I ya I went poly polyclinic last time and they referred me to ya but it wasn't it wasn't nice experience at itself because like the doctor really didn't macam mana eh don't really ah take you no cannot ya
oh my god same eh so aku have been working at huawei for like the past few weeks cause aku punya kerja part time monday to friday and actually boring lah cause aku app testing and also have to scan temperature of the customer then after that obviously huawei got a lot of the old people

hais itu lah
kedekut eh a'ah calculative sial
itu lah
dah lah kedekut bodoh pulak itu alamak
so ini hari we will be talking about corona virus
err in Singapore and how so far kita kat sini at home and uh my family semua how we've been coping
err with all the jobs and all the um confinement semua kat rumah
how the family my family my mum and dad and my siblings and how I've been interacting dengan all my friends lah basically
bila we heard about all this um
corona virus thing err dulu back then I was somewhat employed lah
terus um when I heard about it at first err it didn't seem like such a big deal lah because um
people over there were quite err rilek they didn't care too much about it and it seemed that
err maybe it won't be as such a big issue lah tapi after that when I came back um
I was given a couple of mask tapi I thought like okay lah not really necessary but err eventually it turns out that
so that time bila we saw it on the news err my my girlfriend's uh auntie lah so dia kasi
uh because she's a bit paranoid more than usual so she decided to buy us only macam ten masks or so something like this
habis um ask us to use it err when we are at the airport sebab err who knows kan especially Indonesia agaknya maybe
not so safe lah and then err so I flew back I still wear the mask uh at first I thought macam too much ah actually macam maybe
kat station pakai mask habis um some of them err they there was no form of social distancing ah back then so there was no such advice but
mask ada quite a number of people they were wearing it lah and then um they decided to
eventually err make an announcement on and said that dia punya mask ini semua actually not mandatory lah at first then cakap only kalau macam you sick err you stay at home
err just jaga yourself lah there's no need to go out um and then slowly they start to quarantine and then slowly start to close the border and then
um slowly fall into the whole circuit breaker thing but in between there's a lot of doubt banyak orang orang macam didn't quite understand why we had to do certain things why the government asked to do certain things
maybe err eventually um it escalated to that level where it became a global pandemic lah habis Malaysia orang Malaysia affected orang Indonesia affected
at first Singapore was the first I remember we were actually the first ranked to macam got on the list lah
ah so at first we were the first habis
err in Euro and then slowly got to America and now sekarang kan kita in a state where um
employed habis sekarang macam like looking for job because uh
how about your experience macam mana you were coping with it
okay to be fair I don't think siapa siapa anyone lah was expecting this kind of situation to just suddenly appear
and I think a lot of businesses were impacted banyak um even home based business at some point was err affected kan
uh that was quite bad like the whole malay community like more or less macam slammed her
ya but err because of what she said a lot of people macam tak satisfied lah diorang macam
um kena pulau rabak rabak lah basically because of her statement she even
I think like most people what she should have done is even though sometimes you may think you may be right or niat dia the niat is there lah tapi macam
sometimes it's not about being right sometimes it's about being kind you know yes sure your intention is good macam nak tolong all these regulation issue ah
tapi sometimes it's about you you have to think about your consequences okay lah I mean of course the idea was not to be viral and not to get all this attention
tapi because of your words and especially now people are so uptight during this COVID situation is um what she should have done was
after she did it and of course nak return balik dia punya statement susah kan but at least macam just go out there and just apologize properly
tapi she chose to macam go online and just tell everyone all off that kind of thing is just crazy there's a lot of
and err some of them are funny macam the recent one where the Foodpanda rider just waving around
and I thought it was our good friend Hadi because okay to be fair sebab
habis he will macam ah be in that exact same attire and the exact same pants cuma bike is slightly different lah
like the first time I saw it macam this could be Hadi
it could really have been Hadi the way they dress dia punya seluar dengan dia punya helmet dia punya visor
uh unmarried guy twenty four year old guy but uh I think a lot of people macam does really
um macam it's an unsung hero kind of thing so people were quite uh positive feedback ah about the guy dia super extra ah
and um while it's widely recognised by society singaporeans at large tapi macam it's not something officially recognized by the government
so it's a good analogy to say macam this guy this mat just naik motor habis just riding and
he is not part of the actual celebration of they are not actually celebrating him it's just that dia macam very extra so he just happen to be there and he just
err the first tak salah Deliveroo was to start all this tapi in Singapore I don't know whether is Uber X or Grab or something lah
but what I really feel about food delivery is dia macam quite the game changer okay just think about this for a second ah about Grab drivers err not Grab drivers
people who are do food delivery all this kalau they really macam really work hard macam chiong all the way ah macam maybe eight hours chiong all the way macam Hadi for example kan
um they can earn about three thousand four thousand or even five thousand a month depending on macam mana they hit dia punya incentive or macam mana they hit dia punya
um hours or dia punya right timing ah because all these riders kan macam dorang dah experience for a very long time they will know a certain technique or certain tactic
how to do it right kedai mana um
prepare food quickly kedai mana prepare food very slow they know how to play the game lah basically so if you think about it they can potentially earn a white collar salary
and how skillful you are and how you deliver and how you strategize macam your delivery ah
to the upper income group because macam especially during circuit breaker period a lot of people and the delivery price isn't very cheap also
so every delivery macam ya macam every delivery is about ala carte you pay about four dollars uh or something ah per delivery so
chances are and even there's rich people macam err  beli kopi just one and then they they get the person to deliver and they they they they they
no much prerequisite lah maybe if you macam nak deliver naik motor kan then
ah kena pakai lesen you have to prove your lesen lah but if you are walking or you are riding a bicycle you don't need to
then think about this so I saw an interview err macam documentary lah don't know on Grab and how err some of the handicap people
um they managed to get jobs in Grab macam dulu um when they before Grab kan macam there's almost very little or no job they can do at all
so maybe some of them they did say macam if you are in a wheelchair maybe you can do admin job yes tapi ada orang macam down syndrome for example they can't really do much and
to be a person growing up with this kind of handicap you know macam is like a big macam beban
duduk kat rumah jadi beban jer puas hati macam you go out earn whatever little money you can and I saw this uh girl this Malay girl in a wheelchair lah
of how slow the electric chair also you you can't expect to deliver lah maybe satu hari deliver four or five items lah for example
so macam berdikari lah so instead of
the interface macam the training everything it allows you to do such a simple
err it it simplifies the task basically pergi sendiri pick up pergi sana drop off so it it it gives this
admin position or something macam kena interview tak tahu pass ke tak err your experience whatsoever like a normal job
you will get it you will get it most likely you will get it unless macam kalau too saturated or something lah there's too much driver around so I thought that was quite interesting as well
um the way that the food delivery has changed the landscape of earnings and how uh blue collar workers can potentially earn white collar workers punya salary
err I don't know if this is an actual word indiscriminatory indiscriminate macam
you you don't get err you don't get denied err okay selalunya the idea is when you do the employment kan err you cannot be judged based on your I don't know err race or
so macam for example delivery if you want to work you turn it on and then you work when you're done you're done
so err nak kerja kerja tak nak kerja sudah so when you're tired you get home
so that so called keep them motivated lah whereas macam delivery for motorbike delivery for example bicycle delivery you're not tied down
and you don't have that burden of oh hari ini kena buat sepuluh delivery for example no you earn how much you get that's yours
ah yes okay definitely lah so basically macam you go to the shop and then the food costs ten dollars err what you get
is um basically is through the app punya interface ah so as if the app interface says you earn seven dollars that seven dollars is yours lah
it's it's already a net amount dorang already cut off whatever that needs to be cut off err because sometimes
for example um whatever the food is dorang dah minus the food amount so err this delivery apps they alreally take a bit of your card
terus err whatever is shown in your phone macam you earn let's say six dollar forty five cents for example ah that's yours lah basically
you are okay let's say you are riding habis habis aleh-aleh dia hujan
oh tak ee I still got to go on I need to hit um ten deliveries today or uh I cannot pay my rental or whatsoever so
and how it is a good way for people macam let's say they have spare time ah macam let's say they work nine to five
habis malam macam they got nothing to do they just wanna okay tell you what let me just turn on my device and then err just make a few deliveries on the way home maybe
err ya so we were supposed to talk about corona virus tapi sekarang dah starting so much on delivery
okay question online exam what is stopping people from I mean to buku letak kat tepi
what sort of err security feature or identification yang dorang implement
kan risau
man I don't think I can I don't think I can go back to school already macam kirim salam ah
I mean who you would you get to the level where you think you are at the not say pinnacle lah but you think that you are macam everything dah okay
and you you think that you you can survive on that level of education project kerja just to survive on the salary from that job
um but I kudos to you lah memang is not easy to go back to school when I if you ask me to do it now I would probably won't don't it
or Facebook ada politics pe sekolah pun ada politics pe but one thing I okay so just to do a very very
in school walaupun you don't have to go everyday and you can plan your timetable whatever belajar but apparently you always have this
sinking feeling at the back of your head that macam there's exam coming up and you know you should be studying macam nak enjoy susah
tapi okay it it depends on people right so um
two major popular universities that they went to is either or eh so macam sekolah so basically you study throughout the whole year
whereas for the one that I went to basically err buat project
err it it it becomes like what uh eighty percent of your grade then twenty percent kat belakang exam
so that contributes to maybe twenty percent tapi kalau you have macam ada solid group you can work with
I don't know maybe your school is not like that maybe your school is exam based or but I am sure yours ada project kan
and you know where it unlocks you to you know as compared to macam all these budak budak they still have not have a taste of full life macam full working employment yet
that's why I think a lot of my friends yang um went to you uni SIM basically err university
night university lah so dia orang juggle between the job and basically if you do that you are throwing away your life ah there's no more social life basically
err pagi pagi daytime you go to work and then err malam then you go to school
and then you rinse and repeat basically you need to find time nak buat err nak buat group assignment nak study untuk exam at the same time in the daytime you are working
ya there's a lot of compromise err and you have to be willing to macam at least throw away one aspect of your life and typically is social lah because there's so much there's only so much sleep you can throw away
no lah at first to be honest ah at first bila all this thing happen kan macam um it's interesting err because is something novel
macam is not common apa dulu to to um communicate through okay maybe for you lah but for me it's I it's not common for me to do video calls
even with my own family tapi when this first thing happen and you will start communicating with your friends online
err at the comforts of your own home on your own bed anytime uh kerja err in your own room
it it seems fun at the beginning but afterward macam I think it depends on people also lah because ada orang ada orang boleh focus when they're at home
or the bed sleep lah take a nap during lunch time tu semua for some people it it it it's harder
you know because everything is there already and we just whereas kalau macam kat tempat kerja you've got to drag your ass and then
they switch into mode you know macam home mode err duduk kat rumah macam
more relaxed and then they are in that environment of relaxing cause for me when I'm at home I'm always feel like I'm in relaxing punya mode
and when I'm out I feel like I'm in out mode you know when your hair is macam all wax style and then
ah you know you're wearing clothes um and then you go out and eh you you just have that vibe macam I'm I'm ready to take on the work
you know macam when you're home you just want to relax lie on the bed watch video Netflix or whatever so when you you mix that kind of black and white and you get that greyish kind of area
no don't get me wrong I enjoy I enjoy the break I enjoy the break in um I enjoy the break in the regimen I enjoy the break in dia punya scheduling and stuff like that tapi
macam dekat rumah you can just eat macam you can snack and all that shit err but kalau kat luar uh macam you need to walk for it and uh I don't know
do you okay do you know that when you okay let's say when you err do delivery uh I think the so called delivery fee is about macam four dollars something like this kan
and you can actually see they have macam those package and the funny thing is if that month you just order two times you already make up for it because the the most basic package tak salah is err
no it's like a pass lah it's not really a promo if you say promo means it's apa macam limited edition kan tapi it's actually has been around for awhile
oh well people still deliver food a lot of people still macam still work from home pe banyak orang work from home pe sekarang lah
can work remotely they've been working remotely all this while sampai sekarang
fishy ah the Russian punya vaccine they didn't complete the trial the trial number three what
entah eh
entah lah
well kalau at the end of this year dapat pergi dapat pergi Malaysia pun I'm quite happy already to be honest
all the other countries at least dapat pergi somewhere within their own country kan so Malaysia even Malaysia or Indonesia
even though their borders are closed at least boleh pergi Penang dapat pergi um I don't know
for one of the islands Perhentian islands or something you know Sentosa nak pergi Sentosa Sentosa ada apa kau dah kenapa
if itu bukan itu bukan dia ini tau is not like dia pergi by himself dia pergi ikut err the diving punya tour thing
you still can go pulau hantu now actually
now that I got all this part time job at least macam my sleeping schedule is a bit better
tidak before that I was sleeping macam pukul lima pukul
empat it was ugh didn't like it is too late I forever young what you talking about man I'm you're only as old
tapi it's not like exclusive for
thirty more seconds kita kena clap eh lepas ini or
habis just stop jer
okay tak apa tak apa tak apa uh it just crossed one hour for me so I am gonna turn it off right now
okay ah first kita berbual pasal regarding our hobby lah okay ah so you can first what is it your hobby
cakap lah macam okay example like kalau for me my hobbies is ah I like to read books I like to travel I like to
ah mostly spend time dengan kawan-kawan ke apa ah that is my sort of hobbies that I like
ah I like to I am more an indoor person I don't really suka main dekat luar ke pergi pantai I don't really like it
punya brand tak ada you don't have any other brand yang you suka ke apa ke
kan and I think you also suka Coach
you pun suka
ah quite lately lah I think that daripada dulu pun you memang suka Coach if not just lately
ah so apa lagi yang you
you apa you minat selain daripada bags
okay because for me ah whatever you cook I'm willing to eat and then the thing is I want you to explore kan pasal daripada dulu kalau nak kata masak
we apa more like
terkongkong ada orang cakap mesti macam gini mesti macam gitu kan so
important the family makan and enjoy and so far you are doing
okay you are not like macam apa tak tahu masak ke apa it's edible lah boleh makan and there times yang you masak pada I is
uh fantastic lah it's good juga lah kan
takpe lah the more the more rounder become most to most
to watch football then to play anyway in singapore nak main bola dah susah I I try to ask my friends to play all
with sharif if the kid maybe can can be done ataupun
I think in terms kalau
ah the whole society punya makeup pun dah changed I think now we are
kalau kalau passion the thing is passion is there
budak-budak cuma only have
to ah play for your country so the feeling the impact of the passion is lain
kalau sekarang ni when people play is
you imagine yourself so you're moving your body and you know like you can just move at my fingers and all that so that is the difference even if macam
now like dulu kalau kita nak tengok internet pakai computer will really stay in front of the computer
tapi now even with handphone
kan contact the people pun
tak ini lah so the
itu lah the changes in in time eh so in order to survive
ah mentality zaman dulu punya kan tak nak handphone tak nak pakai
ah internet kan I think kalau sekarang ni if now we want to survive without the internet it's almost
ah I mean even for us as as parents we cannot be apa terlalu ke belakang if let's say we are too far
have to have to try lah kan tu kadang-kadang when we try pun
susah juga nak nak catch up kan but we we still have to
to learn to set up and all that lah kan okay sekarang nak
berbual pasal apa topic lain
kita takde lah travel banyak-banyak tempat kan ah so for our travel is mostly to
ah if not we will be like apa every year at least lah
I think bila kita pergi tu apa boleh
so hope macam apa we can
so biasa lah pergi satu beg balik tiga beg tu biasa lah
what are the ah pattern what is the perangai yang kita boleh
ah click atau tak click what is our
err kalau bawa
ah apa
ah yes lah you can ke depan lah
takda lah at least kan
ya when we first sampai the hotel tu
kan bila kita sampai
bilik tu macam okay everything go like so olden
kan ah ah so after lepas dah the bilik tu okay lah but overall
so sometimes kan you have to buy kadang-kadang macam apa
because ah dorang tak jual
so that's why kadang bila kita when
dorang beli to sell at their shop ke apa kan
nak pergi ah
itu bukan itu aja even someone who
to kasi duit
then dia hulur tangan dia minta duit ni semua kan ah
itu lah kan so other than that
ah indonesia juga bali juga
and your dengan best friend you ah
down there pun our friend is a hindu kan
boleh tahan kan tapi dia punya
ah hotel ada sikit ulu lah
ah kan ah pendalaman
tak kotor sangat tapi to me is ah
kotor juga lah kan
ah big buses tak boleh jalan ah um
in terms sana another thing I remember pasal bali tu pasal kita apa
yang sebelah atas tu eh
gunung apa eh gunung eh
ah gunung tu it was fun lah
basically macam atas tu sejuk it's like going to genting highlands
ya cantik memang cantik but the place tempat makan tu it's like all the buildings
so I wonder ni selamat ke nak duduk sini
kan ah I remember going to the toilet pun it's like
ah like a ghost movie punya punya toilet masuk
dekat situ nampak eh toilet ni senyap jer kan tapi pasal nak kencingnya pasal kan nak kena pergi
pergi jer lah kan but luckily it's only me lah I think if he want to go
kita just duduk and talk
ah a'ah near the swimming pool there so talk dengan raja
so ah nasib baik tu satu jam eh
ah banyak juga lah topic boleh berbual takde
we don't clear all macam apa nak cakap apa we talk
ah kita apa
um ya dia datang kita punya wedding a'ah
kan kita travel dengan dia eh quite a few ah kita pergi penang dengan dia ah
banjir ah
yang bestnya pergi rumah P ramlee tu dia punya
a'ah sikit-sikit lah tak semua lah
uh huh kita respect lah
dia kawan ah P ramlee dia kawan P ramlee dia pernah hidup dengan P ramlee lah so roughly dia tahu P ramlee punya sejarah tu macam mana
jambatan bridge ah
sekali pergi ah he got fear of heights
pusing gitu jer uh huh um um
komtar penang tapi itu pun apa apa macam
ya so dorang tutup that one is the
even the penang chief minister pun ah minta tolong dengan
party kan so it's that bad lah kan tapi
memang nasib kita baik lah kita dapat pergi
but I remembered lah yang kita pergi sana tu
mana-mana kita nak pergi tanya flood ke tak flood ke tak kalau dia kata um ah longer way uh huh
so macam kalau apa even if it's a new shopping centre
but the front part of the building tu di apa
a bit macam odd lah something good
kan kadang macam nampak sangat beza dia
food museum then there is the upside down museum ada the three D three D museum ah basically is the
basically is err apa taking pictures
punya opportunity lah tapi kalau nak kata museum macam gitu
upside down museum I think dekat singapore pun dah ada upside down museum ah so nanti mungkin kan kalau with the apa
then kita boleh pergi lah upside down museum ah
ini bukan apa ini is so called macam apa lepas gian
kan nak travel tak dapat dekat singapore kita boleh lah buat aje lah
boleh enjoy ke tak itu lain cerita lah kan bab kita a'ah the fans ah our friends pun ada kat sana kadang kita travel pun kita suka bawa our friends kan ah itu lah that's the good part about apa
travelling lah kan ni dah tak travel and the thing is ah dah tak travel tu satu hal then with this COVID nineteen
a lot of restrictions tak boleh lebih daripada lima orang ke apa kan abeh kalau nak kawan pun dia empat orang
kita tiga orang dah dah lebih kita tujuh orang kan so is susah juga lah kan hopefully tengok ah hopefully the COVID nineteen punya apa
vaccine can be found nanti kita boleh go to phase three maybe phase four kan
um macam bosan juga lah kan kalau kita kita pergi mana-mana just kita kita nak mingle with other people pun susah kan
ah so that's why kalau kita keluar
kita pakai glove kita pakai mask kan ya lah pakai glove ah
ah touch anywhere kita pakai glove kan kita pakai disposable glove
kita pakai disposable mask anything disposable kita pakai lah to prevent from all these ah
bag tak boleh disposable kalau beg disposable
ah cari topik lah kan
okay for me kalau dua puluh dua puluh satu my wish is kan ah
okay lah anak kita pergi sekolah agama he is able to cope
ah then other than that ah hopefully rezeki kita bertambah lah
ah apa tight restrain now if I move my left hand is not only my hand move other people pun move other parts of this one is other parts of the family so if I move other members of the family pun move kalau kita punya situation kan and got a kid
to jaga kan to jaga we got a special needs adik to jaga kan so but okay lah I think it can be done lah it will be difficult sacrifice perlu dibuat kan cuma hope to apa
hope lagi banyak benda kita boleh
kita will work out lah kan
the vision is clear kan ah our vision is clear kan of course kalau budak susah nak faham kan
ah tapi kata orang pun kita lead we lead kan most important is we try to work together to see the situation settle the situation as a family
we try to work things out kan so kalau macam
of course lah kadang ada orang selfish apa kan so if
that person selfish tak nak cooperate kan
I will do it lah tapi kalau dah tak boleh kan
kau get into masalah
kau suruh aku handle aku I feel tak
tak ini lah tak apa tak adil tak adil kan so I will always go for fairness
leher ah
yes the neck tapi macam the neck only can show where to turn
kan tapi kepala dia ada kepala otak jadi yang kepala otak tu yang decide nak turn atau tidak
ya kan so sebab itu kita as a keluarga we are as a unit kan so we want to move we want to move as a unit
kalau ada orang tak nak dengar ini kan then kalau dia dah sampai apa kalau dia tak nak buat
affect tak nyusahkan orang lain tak apa tapi sekarang dia buat dia menyusahkan orang lain dan dia rasa dia tak bersalah then
really have to apa explain and I really have to go
go and settle the issue lah kan so the issue now is whether dapat settle ke tak
tak tahu hopefully akan dapat settle lah kan
dia nak hidup sendiri tu dia punya pasal lah kan I don't want to halang
kalau dia nak kan kita akan we are
in terms of nak dapat sekolah tu susah nak cakap lah kan
tergantung it's very susah lah then
semua dah buat kan
kan kata orang tu kan
but now the organisation bukan satu tempat
they are two different organisations so yang ini tempat check
ah masa depan
for future yang ini untuk apa
ah dia punya apa bantuan lain bantuan lain so
whether it will improve ke tak
tak juga dia different criteria kan like example kalau macam
ah apa in order to apply for example ah to apply for need
ah certification that he is autistic then dah pergi minds minds dah certify dia dah ah settle
then after that nak masukkan dia sekolah nak masukkan dia sekolah pula oh
certification from uh minds tak cukup
ah doctor lah doctor or hospital or what okay so pergi doctor punya hospital
happen doctor hospital tu pun ah okay lah willing to help okay he did that part
then after that bila nak apply for apa for apa cash in life for home caregiving kan oh
cannot we only we only accept those who are apa
risiko there and the the thing is
okay lah macam cakap macam macam kita ni
macam for macam untuk adik ni
I am willing to usaha kan and I happen I got a cousin is willing to support lah
so kita kena buat kan tapi macam you try imagine
kalau lah all these checks
yes correct and the thing is pula
kita pergi check up ni bukan free
everytime pergi
ah kena bayar ke apa kan but so far I'm lucky in the sense minds tolong
percuma free
ah even the hospital one happen epilepsy punya doctor kan so there is no extra charges lah and
ah so nanti Q cure ni kalau macam apa
in order dah dapat cash in life lah apa ni semua cash in life lah pula nak kena assessment kan
and then the assessment pun need another set of ah check up
kan lah so memang susah lah tapi
ya lah duit apa
kita bukan harap ah ah at least dia improve
istimewa ah uh huh
I think for him is my target for adik is apa
kan kita bukan I'm not expect bukan expect dia boleh
pandai kan macam harapkan dia apa dia dapat
he can enjoy kan of course dia punya enjoy not
macam kita macam kita enjoy oh kita nak jalan kita nak travel kan dia punya tak dia punya enjoy tu
simple something that dia suka
dia feel comfortable sudah kan
ya lah tapi kata orang tu apa ye lah cuba kalau mana tahu kalau dia improve kan
dia punya epilepsy dapat
ah which is now supposed to be terkawal ah kan tapi
tu yang payah dia lah susah dia kan um um um um
ye lah proper food um um um um
budak-budak ya
tapi orang tak tak pandang dia begitu orang treat dia macam apa
tapi tu lah macam kata orang tu apa
treat adik with respect lah walaupun dia istimewa kita make him part of us kan janganlah lebihkan orang luar
abeh anak sendiri pun treat
macam apa kan kita try to make eh dia suka apa kan
bother to find out apa yang dia suka apa yang dia tak suka
apa yang dia comfortable apa yang dia tak comfortable kan
ah bukan setakat
ah apa marah ke apa marah

that's true like singaporean nowadays they have this kind of problem I mean foreigners you know dekat um
kasi lah you know chance sikit kan tutup mata satu kan and just orh come
without any experiences in training will be provided kan boleh pe and
training apa internship they don't even pay much so you still expect us to have experiences that this a bit too much ah honestly
kan susah nak dapat company yang you know really
like baca buku about homework
so like you're contradicting yourself macam apa apa kau nak dari budak-budak ni
like you say you want them to rest you just focus on discipline macam tak kisah dorang buat apa but then
there was oh kena buat assessments lah apa lah
that kind of thing so I'm a bit confused yang budak-budak ni kesian kan dah balik sekolah penat
talk at all you masuk bilik
start belajar
and tak boleh baca buku
sampai habis assessment book
for their well-being macam okay I get it you care for their well-being you feed them
you you know you them macam shelter but
okay lah kalau makan pun takkan tak boleh berbual abeh terus pergi minum air pastu
nak keluar lepas tu nak keluar minum air pun tak boleh tau
kalau rest pun ten minute
I know right my company the withdrawal rate is quite high ah maybe because of that you know kids complain macam eh penat you know I don't want to go student care anymore
quitting lah actually like one month macam about seven
I need to scold every time they can't even will sit macam you know sit like
they fold their legs fold pun tak boleh
yes they have to sit macam you know upright sit properly
you know our own choices macam budak-budak ni like kesian kan semua benda kena
so dapat dapat jumpa dia sekejap dapat dapat ubat rindu you know you know
she dah dah dah dah dah ada suami so lupa lah
tak telephone tak apa
dapat and okay kahwin and like
dan you know but but some people out there you know still finding for
jodoh semua ni susah lah I mean like but
the day I get to eat some nasi biryani
nasi minyak please come on bila ni
macam like I don't know I I will learn from it lah
macam they will get like a set of rules
macam it's kind of unfair
macam takut tau okay you know like they say macam when you
when you buy buang air kecil kan then like there's ends
how to say macam
in my family punya history
ada okay my my dad is a diabetic patient
my grandpa macam semua ada this history of
don't you takut seh say like you know I'm young and you know I love peach tea I love you know
takut lah I mean like I have to take care of my diet lah
so I am like oh okay jap white bread is high
okay macam
insulin tak pakai banyak even insulin is working perfectly
that's the thing kuah lemak apa ah cholesterol oh my god okay there's so much things we have to take care of
dekat kedai ada ke jual salad like hawker centre
we we can buy that for what one dollar than the sauce kita beli like ten dollar but then
that's true beli like banyak then after that simpan in the fridge
this is the thing ah macam
to live you know perfectly balanced life nutrition nak physically active lah abeh busy lah dengan kerja
nutritionist exist to macam lead them
itu semua pakai duit seh do it see I mean like everything revolves around money nowadays
err love pun susah dapat like
that's true and parents nowadays also working abeh balik dah tidur you know that kind of thing
and ya lah it's hard but then that images via weekends are always important you know for us to like you have quality family time but nowadays youngsters weekend gi mana
we lepak dengan kawan but I mean it's not wrong but okay lah macam
ada balance lah okay one day with your parents one day oh I've heard of this story before satu okay there's this one um student right
um makcik tinggalkan
ah abandoned him dekat bus stop dekat malaysia
ah dia tinggalkan ah dia letak bag suruh orang lain jaga tak tahu siapa ah
cakap um bapa nak balik you know that kind of thing and the son also tak cari bapa dia for one month
and nampak bapa dia dekat old folks home
ya that's true macam you know
maybe the financially dorang tak boleh handle the debt
or just maybe tired you know nowadays banyak macam drama drama you know
typical but I didn't know you know this kind of thing exist in real life I always watch it in macam oh ni ya allah tak baik seh
the kids now the kids ada sekarang trauma issues
ya lah they've taken care of me well apa kecil-kecil kasi makan this a way for us to repay back
that's true macam it it
um doing this kind of thing it helps her reduce the dementia punya chances
um lepak or relaxing at her old age
bosan seh duduk dekat rumah you know like the whole thing like
I don't know macam singapore
everyone is rushing to get here to get coffee only ni semua nak merebut lah but then
you know if you really want to chill chill mango pergi dekat paris
just duduk minum kopi and you
ada pros and cons juga fast
pace I mean we're we're successful to certain extent macam economy wah jangan cakap ah
lepak sikit lah
you know the population pun sekarang macam a lot of older generation as compared to know like like
I mean rezeki tu okay lah there's rezeki tu datang dari very you know
makan pun berapa dah berapa dollar okay nak beli pampers nak beli ini and
to me macam house work is not an issue
I mean I would love to have a maid lah I've never been living with a maid before macam sedap kan ada orang kemaskan you and all that
go macam okay err go with the flow macam go with the flow sangat you know
okay to me macam one year gap is quite productive leh like you just take one year to just
momentum dah hilang tau hilang graduate
abeh dah tak belajar eh
macam shiok dah naik shiok
so macam if if you were just to continue and break that one year gap I think we will be more successful but things happens for a reason so ya we are where we are
may I I graduated kirakan macam april lah eh dah habiskan
till november terus start kerja
so better lah aim for it and there's a lot of my friends yang
the punya
so minor I mean you can minor in apa organisational behaviour right those type of thing right
oh betul betul betul
I mean depends ah on the situation kalau nak job hop just because oh you can't take it anymore that's a different thing but if you want a job hope to get experience you know different fields
why not macam you're still young you need to know what you really want in life kalau tak experience macam mana seh
progress betul-betul macam you know be successful
oh my god that is ridiculous okay merepek gila
macam we are barely okay
like with so many macam experience and really capable
takkan nak sama okay over generous everyone as the same
don't over expect too much and also don't macam
you know like letak kita kat bawah sangat you know macam
dorang macam eh korang ni tak ada apa-apa ah just nothing you know
middle lah macam
that's true macam like
I always watch like movies you know macam
and macam susah lah dapat
macam america ni semua
sometimes I do have thoughts macam if we want to be like
apa ni is stranger things
a decent self control punya tolerance but me
like once I'm indulge into that kan habis
it's over for me so I tend I tend to macam you know prevent from this kind of thing like okay ya maybe let me indulge with healthier thing that's why I'm joining like muay thai gym
for I usually waste money on play nation ni semua
tapi waste of money lah so I stop playing games
switch is simple kau macam you can bring it around pastu boleh main
baju ni semua but I'm trying my best not to
I see eh wait where does he where macam mana dia invest
tak sikit kan that's the thing
I only invest on every month I just kasi macam hundred seventy gitu
and for fifteen years ah then macam ada you will get back like a lump sum
um and in case if you were to macam touch wood lah macam pass away or anything like
how to get ah macam
you know these thing which are the backup plan gitu
it's not tak kuat sangat ah but
ya but only to cari like shows
sub Reddits I've been I've been rewatching this show vikings you tengok ke

huzaifi you you read a melayu
primary school melayu textbook you probably need it to be translated for you also
orh kepiawaian means expertise or skill

so like she turned around like she couldn't find me then she turned around then she saw me climbing the pokok then she's like ah turun then I was like no go away I'm peter parker and after that I started climbing higher
ya then nasib baik sia but it's
so ya like I I satan satan tapi bodoh

aku nak aku nak pergi nak pergi jumpa kawan kawan eh like then after that kita tengah joget joget so usually when I go
like clubbing and K I'll go with my friends and then after that we just joget joget together like just guys it's just like playing around by ourselves then after that at one point of time there was this group of girls
also happened to be there and then after that they like trying to like like my friends all like ikut dia orang ah
I sendiri
and after that this girl came up to me then after that she like started macam joget depan I
and after that I pusing belakang then I was like eh bodoh sia lah sempit sia and then I the girl then I they all were like what the fuck sia
kesian the girl tak buat salah sia kena
marah ya sia
hose testing tu apa like you just turn on the thing ah
oh dah buat salah sekarang buat baik pula
baik hati ah
merepek sia
what time you balik
ya okay lah that's not too bad that time my last reservist cycle fell like turun
tujuh setengah kan
and then after that I I didn't turn out for call I malas so I tidur I tidur in like the they have like a mass hall but atas ah on the second floor then the office on the first floor
so every all the everybody else tidur on the first floor and then I tidur on the second floor
habis naik atas like pukul satu pagi then I was like eh ma'am I I go sleep first ah then she like oh K K I see you upstairs
bangun pukul sembilan pagi sia
when I when I went back into the office sia lah semua day crew and then they all like eh you this shift what why you come late then I was like no encik I night shift sia
ya pukul sembilan bangun
then after that nak kena sign out kan the reservist nya attendance sheet
night shift nya semua paramedics dah balik then I was like eh encik macam mana sia then he's like ah never mind I sign for you I sign for you
takkan nak begitu sia lah
balik on the dot sia
orh me and my friends selalu keluar eat breakfast lah so we leave we leave late but it's because we wait for the rest of the medics balik station ah
one time we naik basikal
and then after that my friend like we all cycled halfway already pergi entah mana nak makan lah or something then my friend kata eh sia lah aku tertinggal aku ni barang ah
then after that we cycled back and then we masuk the station like bicyle then we parked the bicycle outside the paramedic office beside the pumper macam
habis dia orang keluar then after that the suay suay the is like oi bicycle siapa ni then I was like encik encik bukan saya punya bicycle
eight bicycles like parked beside the siapa tak bingit sia
twenty percent a quarter of them ah dapat shock
no most of the time if dapat shock it's usually on scene and then it continue in the ambulance
so the pulse dah balik ah
no no when was the last time the patient like dia orang sampai dia dah dah gone kan so like how long before that did they last see him
orh like depan mata ah
kadang eh the
when I went back reservist the medic told me sekarang they make it compulsory sia
kena like you you have to have the my responder app
then after that sekarang dia orang enforce like you have to download
then after that if you dapat the notification kena pergi ah I mean if you tak nampak then bo pian lah but
apa lagi case err the community responder was
habis the this the this captain the the dia dulu macam medical officer
habis my my kawan nampak dia tengah belakang was like belakang selalu macam lepak lepak ah
then after that dia nampak the captain dia terus eh sia lah
my the the responder is captain ah then after that he told us macam
macam take charge of the scenes semua then I was like eh sia lah uar uar sia aku give kau lesson engkau buat bodoh jer macam tu
one of my last few duties ah like my err the most recent cycle I also got a cardiac arrest and then after that the like we managed to resuscitate sia resuscitate the patient dapat we gave like I think three or four shocks
but the nyonya was quite tua already
the dia orang dah tolong this nyonya out of the toilet then she terus collapse so like right from the mata ah then they immediately call
eh usually cardiac arrest kalau pagi pagi kan it's usually a macam orang baru bangun baru bangun then they jumpa the body then it's like dah beberap jam ah so that one
like the body without oxygen like after three or four minutes it's like permanently brain dead like let alone like how many hours right so that's why most of the time when you dapat cardiac arrest
tak boleh save ah
and kena buat betul betul lah that time apa lagi
err my last duty in like my last duty ever kena dapat call the this ah pek he cardiac arrest at a foodcourt
and then after that we sampai and then we saw the doctor there was a there was a clinic in front of the food court ah
and then after that like a the the passerby called the doctor then the doctor datang so when we reached the doctor was doing then the doctor buat you know like got a there's a pace one when you do it's like one and two and three there's there's like a certain pace you have to follow
then doctor buat macam macam jackhammer sia don't know what
macam begitu then after that macam eh pukimak ini apa sia ini rabbit pe and then after that my paramedic my paramedic tengah jalan
then lepas tu he he stopped walking then he turned he turned around he looked at me then he was like
sia lah dia buat apa sia then I was like betul in public K buat betul betul
the doctor the doctor buat sembarang then we after that we all like what the fuck sia the doctor you know
that's why like tak tahu malu ke like
like if you turn out for a cardiac arrest then you get like got two medics in the crew kan you will gaduh over who gets to do
you if you not doing means you have to set up all the equipment so you kena letak the lah the set up the set apa
buat the adrenaline kasi the normal saline then like all the small small stuff and then after that if you buat salah you kelam kabut you don't give it to the paramedic on time kena maki
so like everybody will gaduh over who gets to do
except for me I I don't like doing so I penat
I know my encik was the one who came up with the vehicles sia there like that was his project
I think ya tak salah I heard they got the thing for macam orang morbidly obese
cause the normal the normal alpha sekarang is fucking kecil sia like the old one like the box alpha you you remember right I think your time got the box alpha right
mm the ugly one but got a lot of space so that one like you put inside a fucking obese person also boleh
the new alpha is freaking sempit sia like a normal sized patient already like a slightly heavy normal size patient is already quite sempit already
plus the dengan the stretcher kan
like you don't need to angkat the stretcher like you just picik the thing then it's like mechanical then the the legs go up by themselves bodoh tak nak taruh in ambulance when we actually convey patients ke mana yang sedia
rabak sia
wait the the guy also a medic ah tu
actually ah the my last cardiac arrest case like bila balik reservist ni we also turn out with and then after that I nampak kan
so far dia orang asyik suruh the boy yang buat then after that yang lain semua diri kat keluar kesian sia
so like the so when comes the the ambulance crew like tak
like lepas tangan so we do all the other stuff like the medical the medical equipment ah like we put in the apa tubing semua
and then after that so like free up free our hands lah so the crew yang buat
and then after that like I tak pernah nampak anyone wearing orange bunker gear buat so far is selalu the firefighter
tak ah
what you all turn out pakai bunker gear pe
tak stress ah
oh then nasib baik sia nasib baik ada the fire fight
sekarang it's that's damn short sia so dulu dulu during my time kan the attachment was like two dua tiga tahun begitu
so like basically the whole and then semua turun then after that they take turns doing I don't know what the the the protocol is ah like I'm sure there's like some
ya so basically right the the people will do the and the alpha people buat the medical staff lah the semua
but then sejak COVID then they stopped because they want to limit like exposure or whatever
apa fire site
I get lah if you want to be ons but tapi ko nak kacau reservists buat apa sia
baru juga ah
double meaning tu apa sia
so it's basically covering the punya
oh so if turn out then you ikut if turn out also you ikut ah
oh rabak
rabak pe
penat ah
mana siap lah at least you dapat
last time tak ada kan your tak ada you get to face
a'ah mampus I I loh
then macam kawan pekik
the officer just bawa lah then he just continue
ya tak probably ah
but I already do two cycles tak pernah dapat sia the card terlupa
then tak pernah they never give
the no lah it's not like we go through the full benda lah cause we already know how to do it what so it's basically
and then they have the mannequin habis kena buat lah then they measure
I think it's just paper work ah so they like when you balik reservist then they said like oh we all got the cert already so we can turn out for cardiac arrest
was you ajar I
you taught me the hiemlich kat rumah atuk
I remember you that time you you masih botak I think you still in that time then you got to
and you keluar apa buka and and then after that you you told me right eh you know what I learnt or not then you started doing the hiemlich on me ajar pe
I had I had one this one time in got this one nyonya she said like oh I I'm choking
and then after that we sampai sia lah this nyonya fucking waste our time sia then she like mati mati she said like oh I can feel it in my throat I can feel it in my throat then we asked her what you eat she's like oh
that one is a different bodoh like if you are if you are actually choking you cannot talk but you should be able to sign if the person is right in front of you you confirm can like sign say you choking what
but like if you can berbual and tell the operator on the phone that you are choking then after that the the ambulance sampai
then you can buka the pin you can walk to the door buka pintu then you like oh I I choking just now I ate this nut I can feel it in my throat
I turned to my paramedic that time I that time I tengah ah so like my perangai already like like half fuck ah
then after I turned to my paramedic then after that he like I I told you macam cakap buang masa sia then after that my paramedic's like eh lain kan lain kan
then after that she takut then I was like then what the fuck you want sia
bingit sia
ya but I orang
my paramedic penakut so he convey
ya orh it's more of like he malas want to
ya she mati mati want to go
that one I bingit
like my friends all they say like oh sia lah they they malas want to turn out for like rabak punya call
but like I'd rather go for rabak call then the call is just waste my time
I mean macam ini kes bodoh bodoh sia then it's just like naik marah sia
got one time apa lagi this budak dia dia dia call ambulance dia kata like oh I I I tried to kill myself so we gotta rush down lah we thought like apa jadi
cepat cepat ah pergi
then we sampai already then we ask him what what what did you inject you tell us specifically so we like dia orang cari macam bleach bottle ke apa on the floor then he said oh I swallow this uh I swallow coins
the budak the budak call
or whatever then after that he complained complained complained then I was like no no no why you swallow the coins like you you want to kill yourself I understand why the coin then he like I don't know what to do then after that my paramedic marah me he's like eh abang kau tak boleh main main then I was like it's a legit question though what the fuck
ya after that my paramedic like he my my paramedic don't let me talk to the patient already he like kau duduk kat tepi kau main main
that one pecah nyawa nyawa on another level and that wasn't me there wasn't me that wasn't me I that one I tak berani the the kind of thing I don't play

so the is like a sci-fi movie where err the story is about this err boy who suddenly had the superpower to actually control technology from his mind ya ya so err it happened err sebab one day dia macam apa tu he got ambushed or got chased by a group of his classmates
so dia punya classmates I mean when the group macam ada
gangster gangster sikit ah ya so like even though they are very young the err they know they they they they can handle like dangerous stuff like pistol and drugs ya so that time uh macam dia tengah lari tengah lari from the orang kan abeh um one of them from the bad guy actually tembak
tembak the the guy so he hit the side of his head ah ya so because of that he went to a coma then the doctors said that there were actually fragments of of the phone err in his head fragments of a phone in his head ya I know I know I know it sounds stupid lah but ya this what is actually what the doctor said ya so because of that he actually got a superpower
err to actually um see whatever you're typing err whatever you are whatever you whatever you are conversing on your phone or whatever that is phone related lah and he has the ability to macam technology from his mind ya so is it got it got like err if you think about it right macam there's a lot of things you can do if you can control technology cause technology is everywhere right now in our society which I think is very cool lah very cool
ya cuma macam now that the movie is he is using his superpower for others uh for others for his own good and to help others lah I mean macam so he helped to track down the the culprits ah so the story was err macam apa tu uh this uh the neighbourhood is macam ada apa eh
macam ada is run by this err drug drug society drug a group ah like err ya so he helped to track this group down abeh macam help the police to do so he he use his technology macam to draw them in lah to expose on the drugs and dark secrets dorang ada to the neighbourhood and to the police
orh no no no no he's a middle school student ya he also has the ability to draw cash from bank accounts macam like err ya he can just drain your bank account just like that or also like err put in money into your bank account just like that so which is quite cool lah ya
ya ke oh is it that's nice oh he more like he targets the the gangsters society but dia macam he let them uh like he drains all of their bank accounts so that dorang tak ada resources
orh err usually for me I haven't been I haven't experience err any strong stereotypes by my peers or by my the people who I socialise with so I cannot really say much but I know that macam
there's always like err well known stereotypes err within the malay community err for example macam one very good example would be macam orang melayu tak pandai tak pandai in math gitu ya from young so and usually like err because like orang melayu suka macam lepak dekat void deck gitu so we are we are we are seen as like lazy people lor in a sense ya
which I think err palsu lah because like you as you grow up you will learn to take things on your stride then you will you once you find out what you like and then you will work towards it what it's the same for everyone cuma dulu is okay what to lepak cause like last time with your friends just chill chill lah like if if you like to me if your if your kind of lepak is main err like computer games or like
or like that kind then your our kind of lepak is really like is at the void deck lah chit chat yang main guitar ya so is the same kind of lepak lah I mean is just different kind of how you view lepak as
even though I do agree that err there's a smaller percentage of malay people who go to university but err to local universities but I know like there's actually a lot of my peers from secondary school who goes the poly then uni route so they still end up in a in a uni is just that they may have gone to err macam public uni ah I mean local uni or private uni but they still go to uni
in the end eventually ya I also have some cases macam after poly right they they err they do not wish to pursue university cause they already had their career settled back then macam if you look at err maritime studies kan err from poly err I think I got one friend yang macam he he he majored in maritime studies then right now he's always on the ship one
it depends on on on the direction or the career direction that you choose lah I think everybody has their has their special everyone has different talents ya what what they are good at what they are bad at ya macam gitu jer lah
lama eh it's very long
macam apa tu macam macam nak satu jam eh
subsidised subsidised heavily subsidised for public schools tapi when you talk about those non like err like we have certain schools in singapore yang macam the fees very expensive kan so usually like all the rich families will be able to go but not err for those families yang macam tak boleh afford lah because the fees are very expensive even like um macam if you want to join some of the you have to pay more
ah education is free for all especially when you when when we are talking about those lower income families yang macam or those like err families yang macam rumah tangga ada masalah uh mak bapa tak boleh beri uh tak boleh kasi apa tu uh apa tu tolongan pertolongan kepada uh apa tu anak-anak mereka so I think this is where it will be nice lah if the err those families uh those kids um can
you do lah but some people just need err err a bit of that push in the beginning I feel like uh macam some some kids they wouldn't even think about scholarship they are not interested because they don't even have the drive in them so if you show them or like if you give them a bit uh of like resources a bit then they will start to see orh this is the reason why we should pursue such things in school lah so that you can have greater access then
from there they will work towards uh macam striving to to get a scholarship
but you have to eat other people for meals dahsyat seh
foodpanda dah takde agaknya asal nak

tak habis tengok jadi kita tengok sendiri series tu uh pasal tu potong-potong so tak tahu lah apa jadi takde nak kena tengok online ah dia main kat jer so nak kena stream ah
uh patut tadi keluar habis hujan lebat gila
mm besok mungkin uh nak pergi uh beli beras tengok ah macam mana makan kat luar ah
uh belum tahu tengok cuaca
uh dia pergi memancing oh tapi tak jadi tak tahu ah tadi dia pergi tadi dia dah siap-siap tau lepas tu dia dia keluar lepas tu kejap lagi dia masuk balik lepas tu dia cakap uh gerimis lepas tu dia taruh balik the barang-barang pancing dia lepas tu kejap lagi dia duduk kat kerusi so tak jadi lah tu sebab tu dia kat situ
dia hantar kat kedai omar tadi uh uh petang tengah hari
a'ah sebelum hujan
cuci carburetor jer
oh full service dah cakap dah dah tanya dia dia cakap boleh buat sendiri huh
ah tak pasti mungkin kot pasal abang ayie dah pass two A kan so dia nak bawa motor tu kan
uh ya by the way kan tadi kita berbual pasal dua belas dua belas uh actually you can also buy grab vouchers or cinema voucher in shopee tau it's a good deal macam you just pay five dollars but the cinema voucher is worth nine dollars
ah see how lah if got stock maybe I will buy some of the grab vouchers ke or I will buy the cinema vouchers
so dia punya is testing so so maksudnya dia uh
oh okay okay so kalau kalau nak apply macam uh position apa yang most slightly akan take your cert take uh takes graduates
rovers okay then kalau uh uh how macam mana boleh pakai cert tu untuk apply kalau boleh jadi apa
uh dekat uh poly macam ni ah the the normal the five poly's one of them so uh bayar ah ke oh diploma
oh bagus eh tapi tapi dia join dia join under uh full time staff or contract staff
contract tapi dia tolong untuk further studies oh that's good ya I think most likely dia dah dapat diploma dia akan take dia akan take
oh okay okay then uh ada apa-apa lagi tak kerja yang macam
mm bagus lah tu
kalau ah
okay lah tengok ah macam mana rezeki nanti try lah
apa tengok apa ada opening apa lagi
the the uh turkey right ya yang tujuh setengah tu jangan lupa so nak beli apa untuk alesya
for spark ke X one R
oh actually okay very simple okay untuk motor-motor uh spark atau motor X one R ni
takkan sentuh satu benda pun selagi tak bayar owner dia duit
so akan just naik jer
dua-dua uh under ayah punya nama bukan nama kita kereta jer so um
dia punya plan kan is uh dia punya plan uh kalau
uh dah ada motor yang bagus
ataupun kalau takde tapi nak naik yang ini so akan uh beli lah buy over so bayar ayah let's say X one R X one R worth berapa sekarang
okay so maybe bayar dia dua ribu beli beli dari dia okay okay ni just misalnya lah so kalau betul-betul nak buat something eh uh uh nak pakai X one R tu jadi spare and nak nak repair hantar kat rumah kan so kita nak kena bayar dia jadi kita nak keluarkan nama dia so akan bayar dia just like token ah I takkan bayar full sum okay motor not good condition so maybe dua ribu lepas tu uh baru hantar kedai baru akan taruh duit
so sekarang tak bagus jangan kacau apa-apa because motor tu takde nama takde full ownership so macam tu lah cerita dia so sekarang bila naik kan dia dia punya motor dah start bising tapi dia kata dah adjust
chain tapi tak tahu ah kena try lagi
sebab dia sebab dia bising apa ah
tengok ah macam mana so tu lah plan dia kenapa ada siapa-siapa minat bawa X one R atau nak betulkan berapa banyak motor nak ada ya tapi faham kan that means kalau sesiapa nak lumba
tahu tapi faham kan because selagi benda tu kita punya kita tak boleh ubah
nanti dia akan jadi part dua so nak buat apa-apa pun nak kena beli over itu motor atau at least letak duit jadi tutup story tu nanti lah dulu tengok kasih kita fikir because ada chance uh uh I prefer uh lagi suka nak beli motor uh apa nama dia
uh lupa lah nama dia uh no no bukan kapcai uh yang macam uh azri nak bikin tu apa nama dia ya tapi uh no two B two B tu kirakan uh dia kirakan bukan W two hundred kirakan nak beli yang siap dia dah bikinkan ah mm so kalau uh tu kan banyak pakai duit kan so kalau nak beli nak nak pakai duit untuk motr gitu then
takkan nak buat nak spend tu duit untuk motor motor kapcai gini
so uh sampai kita dah beli motor idaman uh jangan fikir langsung nak buat apa-apa dengan X one R ni
ya tu plan dia lah tapi
it's this um objective dia sama selagi motor tu ada tuan dia jangan pandai-pandai godeh kau siapa yang nak jawab
ya lah so tu jer lah cara dia uh kalau betul-betul nak kena beli jer ah jadi uh takde orang akan bising
itu jer lah
mm so uh bagus tak idea kita
boring tapi kalau kita dah ubah suai nanti kalau ada apa-apa masalah siapa yang nak tanggungjawab
mm fikir tapi okay lah nanti bayar dia dulu lah tengok lah
uh apa cerita dengan abang yang dekat hougang tu dia nak bawa uh dia nak dia dia masih nak bawa delivery tak
ke tu saja jer dia cakap apa dia cakap apa
ya then when you tell him that what did he say it was was he serious or he was just uh just berbual kosong
then um kenapa uh sekarang baru nak buat ni pasal dia selalu ada uh apa free time apa dia tapi dia kat rumah main game kenapa dia tak pergi buat this delivery job
so sekarang dia dah relax ah baru ada time
kurang lah
dia nak buat delivery ah
eh dah bilang dia nak kena bayar uh bag dia semua dia cakap apa
okay tapi tak cakap apa-apa pun senyap jer so maybe berbual kosong ah
tengok ah macam mana
eh oh okay nanti dia datang rumah tengok ah dia ada cakap pasal ni ke tak
so dia nak beli motor apa yang kat bawah tu
mm a'ah tak faham pasal uh bukan ke uh start topic ni cakap pasal dia nak kerja delivery so kalau dia nak kerja delivery kenapa nak pinjam duit untuk beli motor scrambler macam motor dia bawa dia patut pinjam duit untuk beli motor biasa motor kapcai hmm
tapi uh okay so kirakan takde link ah dengan delivery sekarang ni pasal dia nak ada link juga
nak dua ah delivery and also untuk dia
tapi dah dah bilang dia lah kalau nak bawa delivery pakai uh scrambler susah
so boleh nampak kan yang macam tak make sense kan oh uh tahu tak bila dia mati eh
tahun depan so that's why ya
then dia cakap apa kenapa kenapa dia terkejut
then dia cakap then dia cakap apa
ya jangan main-main bilang dia kalau dia buat benda ni dia akan kena boleh kena buang eh
tahu tapi tahu tak tu boleh jadi dia jangan jadi viral
ya lah so so kerja apa shift but ah by the way dah boleh kerja roo tau
dah boleh start kalau nak dia bayar bagus tau tadi sebelas dollar sepuluh
oh macam surcharge gitu ah oh
ya but I didn't uh tapi tak tahu tau yang dia naikkan dia punya docket pasal hujan ingatkan pasal distance pasal distance dia pun jauh juga
berbaloi uh apa um apa lagi eh ni deliveroo ya so dah boleh naik dah boleh uh log in dah
then ah grab pun dah boleh
tapi grab is lima dollar kalau satu trip deliveroo uh equals to tiga no uh dua trip grab
ya ya tapi tak tahu tahu uh the distance uh pasal that time roo punya is jauh
tapi jauh bukan jauh gila ah jauh macam jauh paya lebar
oh okay um sekarang I'm doing like part time um kerja part time so macam um I do some um actually doing financial advisory um ya at the same time doing um freelance freelance works ah ya um macam and doing translation works for untuk bahasa melayu to and bahasa indonesia ya
ah no no no I'm actually singaporean but last time I had um indonesian punya maid so sometimes ya
uh ya ya ya so actually um like last time my maid selalu um talk to me in in bahasa indonesia macam I know how ya how to speak ya hmm
um actually it just baru baru start so macam um macam just had like briefing then uh so far haven't actually do the the translation yet ya
ya I think macam health actually quite important lah um ya I rasa macam when looking for a job it's important to
look for something that actually you would really feel happy macam what's the what's the point what's the point kalau kau pergi kerja everyday then like very stress and this kind of things is very unhealthy lah for your good for your health and stuff like that
same lah sama sama ya is is I think macam it's quite common gitu to feel that way if like when you're unhappy at the job ya
dah berapa tahun dah berapa tahun in
you kerja oh so baru graduate also
oh drama side drama side macam buat apa like day to day like what is it like
oh macam just macam entertainment untuk dia punya budak-budak that kind of thing lah
hmm so you're you're you're currently taking a break so your company macam allows you to to to to take breaks in between lah
mm dia mm okay I understand I see ya actually the way you feel is actually quite common lah untuk like some some of us yang baru start kerja then like like we didn't had prior experience in or maybe we had internship but it was slightly different so we thought that macam when we graduate the work would be in certain way but actually is not so I guess it's actually like macam is it a mismatch of expectations bila you baru start kerja you thought it would be something else
mm actually good good that your boss macam I recognize that you you need to take a break then um then kalau when you're better than you can always balik go back to work he said you can go back right at least he welcomes you back then that's good ya ya so for me uh ya lah macam I work for dua tahun then lepas tu uh I tried dua company tapi macam uh at the same time it felt different tapi macam same like the problem was the same that I that I face at both companies so I also macam tak tahu if it's the industry punya issue or kalau I need to change industry atau change company ya macam that that problem was in my problem was in my head for a while so I decided to macam take a break and then um from there I explored different different punya industry and then um at the same time I kerja part time then um macam trying to at the same time I explore lah whether I feel nak stay in this industry or I want to go to something new that kind of thing it's tough lah one thing like when we graduate and then we don't know what we want to do forever kind of thing cause ya because your career is you like to decide right macam you want to stay here or move to something else like ya
ya at least some more now macam it's COVID punya period then then nak nak cari kerja pun macam susah then ya so our options are limited right don't you think
it's something better than macam nothing right
ya ya ya I think to be honest macam singaporean man a bit cautious or like became fikir banyak sangat of what people think of us you know right we should just can just do whatever that feels good for you then kalau doesn't it doesn't feel good then I guess it's not good for your health also then you should just do something else I guess ya I'm start I'm starting to like accept that a career doesn't always go the way you want it to go and that's and that's that's okay because not everyone has a perfect career at the start also so macam just take it day by day try something new I guess if if if you want to try something new learn something new sekarang I'm I'm actually I'm studying something about digital marketing with so macam at every ya every setiap pagi I I have to attend the what is it called a webinar ya ya it's for macam tiga jam jer then um ada assignment then um some project ya just learning new things I guess
oh the the webinar is actually uh era diploma like a full blown diploma so it's enam enam bulan then ya at the same time they are macam giving allowance for it so I guess that's good ya tapi those hmm tu actually untuk mid career adults lah macam those that ada work experience but you want to try something new so I just just took this opportunity to learn something new lah I guess ya
tak payah because everyday macam is just online so we just attend it whenever you want to wherever you are also can on mobile
but how macam mana nak teach the kids if it's working at home I don't understand
hmm okay I see I see I see sebab dia what do you feel about on on that that kind of arrangement
ya macam overload of things to to do right do you feel
tapi what about the your your other work punya colleagues like do they feel the same way
hmm sounds very challenging lah macam susah so
ya so macam I told you I took a break from I I totally left my industry at the moment lah so I started taking um um I started joining this financial advisory punya company then dia orang give like trainings um to to prepare us lah macam how to how to like you know prospect for clients macam how to um basically like sell their their products that kind of thing ya so at because I rasa sales punya skill is quite important macam in every industry you go is quite important to be able to sell your ideas or kalau be it ideas or products to anybody lah so so I rasa macam it's a good opportunity for for me to learn new skills like sales is not easy right this is what I learn macam susah to macam convince people um to actually buy into your idea or buy into whatever it is you are selling ya so it's it's a process lah I'm I'm still it's it's been about three months ya so thing ya
hmm I macam baru start meeting clients that um uh there are some um potential potentially potentially that potential clients sorry ya so that one ya will have to follow up on that ah ya
so um other than that macam I think you what you said about um an environment a good environment is quite important to be in a good environment and supportive um like make you macam want to go to work everyday that kind of thing you know ya so so far so good I guess tapi macam I haven't actually um had a successful sale but hopefully soon ya ya
then thank you then um for the ya for the part time work ya I just started because I wanted to macam earn extra income ya ya so it's in a sense macam or even though sekarang I'm like not earning as much as last time I feel like more happy macam ya like I don't bangun tak rasa macam stress or in like angry you know that kind of thing ya like then you go then after work macam you don't feel so fed up like you don't feel like not talking to anybody this macam how I felt lah everyday after after work last time like you balik rumah macam tak ada mood to talk ya you just want to like bathe and sleep ya ya
ya I think it's common like macam I spoke to my kawan my friends dia orang pun macam rasa the same the same thing lah ya but those for those that are not happy with their work ya so
then you got try macam try company company lain tak like because ini your first job kan
so you did you like try to apply for different companies see whether macam is different environment that could maybe make you feel differently about the work itself
is it you are supporting financially ke or dia boleh pay for dia punya own things like oh is it difficult
I see I see okay then I will just I will just talk about myself ya ya ya okay um so um ya it's really macam it's I think sekarang we're in a very difficult punya position pasal there are many things that we are expected to be able to achieve by now so actually I'm twenty I'm twenty six years old how about you
oh you are twenty only oh sorry sorry I'm twenty five not twenty six ya so like and ya at at at the same time my my mak and my my dad don't pressure me lah like because ya even though I'm already twenty five tapi dia orang macam they know it's not easy lah our time to like they said last last time by twenty five dia orang dah kahwin dah ada anak you know that kind of thing but they but they don't macam push that idea on to me that you know that kind of pressure so I think ah macam syukur lah like I feel quite
mm I see ya I think macam same my family macam not very affectionate also when growing up what macam don't we don't really communicate face to face with so much
you ada connections with like theatre punya um like people in the theatre industry do you have connections
um actually macam I just told him I am exploring something new lah while because like at the same time also um learning like macam tengah belajar new things ya while I take advantage of the trainee trainee not really trainee right it's like a course by united so macam I'm just taking a break it's been about two three months plus ya about almost almost four months
then I feel I mean because I I don't depend on him for anything lah like I can pay for my own things like I ada savings and that kind of thing so I mean he is he's okay with that lah like he kind of like supportive I guess ya
but I guess like ada ada like I guess like it's normal to feel not good enough when you're not sure also ya
ya I think macam having colleagues they are so helpful is so great for for any workplace lah it's it's quite important to have a supportive your colleagues that you can talk to laugh with that kind of thing macam it you make you look forward to nak pergi kerja you look forward to seeing them
then dia orang dia orang tak bayar hmm
hmm oh you mean the your conversion is is a proper diploma or what like macam mana like how does it work
so what do you think macam you want to try ke you don't want ke
at the same time um I rasa like while we're still young important to save also lah saving is quite important ya ya so macam since since I was young kan I always believe in saving then macam I am quite thrifty lah macam and like macam tak spendthrift sangat so like I made sure to to have enough savings lah so that on a rainy day I won't feel the pain so hard ya
tapi you got you got try macam apply to a different company for the sponsorship for early childhood tak
oh but now is the intake right you said october you just check macam apply for fun lah like what's what's it there's nothing to lose kalau you apply if anything there's a there's something to gain right hmm
ya tapi you can just tell her later kan like macam that you you're but you're officially left right you said
tapi ada notice period tu semua lah
oh kenapa
then kalau kalau you leave you must bayar dia punya six thousand ke tak like it like if you do finally decide
tapi macam you don't owe companies anything you know sometimes like if you want to leave you can just leave then kalau tak then we'll go back that kind of thing that you don't have to be trapped feel trapped ya
okay actually I ada kawan yang just started the early childhood she also was from engineering punya field then I think she did the conversion but I don't know whether is it's the same conversion as you
ya so kalau you want you want me to connect you with her I can give you her number that you can talk to her then like find out more about dia punya program how it when cause I think she's been there for she's been there for about three months or something few four months
no worries then then from there maybe you can like decide whether you want to continue or not cause she switch industry totally so dia totally no background in early childhood whatsoever but she wanted to try and she she I think she's okay I'm meeting her next week so hopefully she's okay you can find out from her I will tell her that that that I have a friend who wants to find out more early childhood then can ya then I think it's important to talk to people macam sometimes you feel shy right I am also a shy person so I don't really like asking I don't really asking people for opinions or held that kind of thing it's not macam out of arrogance is just like personality
so ya macam some ya ya ya that feeling what's segan to us just sometimes that feel that way tapi actually it's quite important it's quite important to to to talk to people who already have experience macam whatever you have experience lah then you can maybe hopefully get encouragement or like inspiration from this this kind of people ya
ya I would link you I would link you I would link you up later then at least macam lah like like after you talk to her then if you realise okay I really don't wanna do early early childhood then you can start looking at other industry lah then at least you roll one out
so actually I met her from um like a random punya part time job also then macam we got close ya after like a few few weeks ya so then we kept in touch and macam after how many years still keeping in touch which is like as if like we know each other so long ya
so ya macam random it's like a random near two two weeks or three weeks job then after that we still keep in touch so it's quite nice ya
I don't know I think macam I'm I I I before I do things I put a lot of macam thought into it it's not macam a fleeting decision like I was really macam very stressed out at my previous workplace then I was like okay I had enough nowadays I need I need a real break like even even my punya bosses all like understand lah like my work was difficult lah like I was facing a difficult punya client macam everyday hentam on email kind of thing so it was very stressful ya
at the same time macam as in like I said lah because I had macam savings to to tide me over a few months of not working so that that's that's important lah like like what I'm telling you cause like you're younger right
so that I know like if you do need to take a break you can afford it you know that kind of thing like I know not everyone can afford not everyone can afford to do what I'm doing lah ya it's not it's not easy to like especially imagine kalau you ada children or what you know not they they cannot definitely cannot do what I'm doing lah like take a break and not work kind of thing
oh probation ah macam sekarang sekarang is probation period is it
tapi dia punya contract what the contract say
no but your contract said you have so actually macam you have like a right to keep fight for it ya and then dia orang tak they didn't write anything about probation right in the contract then actually you can ya if I were you I would have fought
you have do you have siblings like you ada kakak or adik like
oh only one kakak lah
huh sorry oh see I see okay ya I'm also not tak tak not close to my siblings my elder siblings too pasal dia orang dah marry and then left also like move out ya it's it's common lah
so um I hope everything will be better for you after you speak to my friend or that or like after you find something that you decide to do part time to like macam sustain you for awhile and not have to think so much about money
yes yes yes I agree ya I agree that hmm that is so important macam not many jobs are like that these days in singapore
tapi macam like when you say expressing yourself right I've been to macam cafe where dia punya server is so friendly like dia bother to check up with the the customers like you can always do that like it's it's one form of like expressing yourself like recommending dia punya food you know that kind of thing like little little little little things that you can like say to express yourself like I think think you can't do that if I'm sure you can do that at F&B too

tak ada no I looking
okay so ni lisa ni like how I don't think the the
I I've I seen phone cases where you can um like print macam pictures on the phone case I'm thinking that you are saying like macam a picture sort of thinkers the frame pictures that's what
that's what sarah is saying right and then ah dekat
plaza sing there is um the kedai tingkat dua depan pizza hut where you can make
ya correct kalau macam can
a tote bag with our pictures then they go to like macam supermarket
macam aww I have my tribe with me while I go buy some bawang
photo book you you you are right cause I have friends who give me photo book I look it on memories aww then cry then after that taruk dalam kotak and then like
when you clean up your house baru buka oh ya I remember this rachel give it to me two years ago ah what
I think kita like err we can just do
okay I think got like dua minggu to
the way she's guarded now is like ah whatever ah sembarang ah on ah go jer like she she she ya
eh lighter mana like lighter mana
ya ya ya and then I just she she tried to be the again the the the kakak kakak like trying to make jokes I was just like
ya ya I I nearly had that with sarah with the whole bali thing with the whole tini and the bali thing and all that cause I I macam
meeting tini was just like a coincidence thing cause she dia dia kerja dekat the hostel kat mana ni clarke quay then I was working kat lima pe
so I I know that tini has been like a bit emoish on her facebook and what not so I'm like eh babe come ah lepak ah like
ah apa ni aku habis kerja pukul lima like we can just like hang out eh no that time habis kerja siang two or three so we just smoke like by the side of like haji lane and then she just goes on and on about what had happened in bali when me and azmi left so when me and azmi was there and we asked her face to face even
jas was there with us tak ada apa-apa lah no lah nothing dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas that kind of thing so we went back to singapore cause like sarah was heads head over heels like macam orh this jas guy is nice memang he he he is a very lepak guy to hang out and all that and then we told her babe
I think he's just being a gentleman I think he really got nothing with tini cause we asked tini face to face so all these while when tini like when we when me and her hung out ah like she like oh dekat bali this happened and then he give me all these
tini macam ah macam oh dia cakap gini dia cakap gini pasal sarah and it was just lies cause I know what is happening on sarah side as well
this fucking dia dia lupa pe sial kita like in a group ya correct then um like she just keeps on talking and talking and talking like all the way until back to my house I was just I I I I swear to god I just diam I just cause she she
ah she was just basically macam member lah eh jas gini gini gini I don't know I have ah macam you know commitment issues tini like of course lah kan dia dengan dia punya commitment issue blah blah blah and then you know ah this happen and then she's like oh jas told me dia pergi lepak dengan kawan dia after the tipsy cow and I knew that was not was happening cause I knew that jas went back with sarah hey cause dia lupa sia correct then I
when I hear all these things from tini I'm like bullshit bullshit sial lah dia ni puki betul budak
so at some point no we hung out kita lepak dari pukul dua tiga
sabar sabar sabar sabar so
at at some point tini said this sentence um jas cakap dengan aku um macam uh I never felt like this for a girl before dia cakap gitu that that didn't happen just last weekend like at tipsy cow right
this is what's happening with him and sarah and then tini just went full on bitch mode and that was what happened that night he wanted to follow she wanted to talk to sarah hari tu juga dia nak berbual dengan sarah babe
I don't think it's okay for you to come not like this we don't talk to sarah now cause it's just not gonna happen like we are gonna go out tak apa tak apa tak apa boleh berbual lah dia cakap gitu then at at some point I told sarah sarah
cause what me and azmi told her was that actually jas and tini tak ada apa-apa but when we were there memang they really like
they they told me to they told to our face eh tak ada apa-apa dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas
ya jas dengan tini and then when we left back when me and azmi left first then they stay in bali apparently something happened and jas is just telling bullshit to her lah
ah so dia masih dia dia fikir dia casanova this guy sana like that so um
she just went her minah lah she did became the minah
err dia salahkan jas but she wanted to like talk to sarah and like what the fuck is going on like that ya so ah ya then then that night happened and
ya then I'm like kau nak pergi berbual dengan sarah buat apa kau pergilah berbual dengan jas I say like that dia yang buat problem pe like I was so angry
ya and then that was another awkwardness so sarah got pissed at me cause she thought I was badmouthing about her to tini which was not the case at all so when I had a one on one talk with err sarah I think like one or two weeks later it was just me and her at and dekat rumah dia dekat yang percil tu ah we we lepak we hung out
ah I am what was the word she used um macam berbual belakang dia ah like talking about her like that then I said no that was not the case this was what happened and my intention was not to stir up shit or talk about you behind her back and she felt like that cause before that there was the whole um
about what happened with them yes so these two things she thought like aku rattle mouth but the first one also then I said I understand what you're feeling about like the bash but really my intention at that point of time
you can you you can ask azmi you can ask nisa or whoever was there at your birthday lah that was your birthday right my intention was really eh sarah this this happened to sarah okay sekarang like how like what we gonna do about this like how can we help her
you know it was real but for her I overstep the line the fact that she told me and azmi in confident and I go out macam to her aku
ah macam lan jiao wei pasal dia babe I I told and I look at her in the eyes
I just wanted to help you and she said she didn't she didn't need help I'm like okay so from the conversation ah what I macam ah what I ah take from it is that ah sarah and sarah is dia always takut err she put put this image of herself that's not nice I feel lah this is just my personal
um macam um how to say eh macam um
no no no like macam dia jaga conduct
like like her way her her image is dia nak kena jaga conduct she don't like people talking about her cause I don't know maybe she has her own demons or anxiety and all that right so she correct no one ah ah I totally understand like I'm her friend babe I fucking love her you know like I will not do that and I
so I I I I I went back home and not nangis to azmi but macam I felt so I felt guilty of course that she felt like that right how can I not babe you know but then at the same time I told azmi that I I I I know this is my niat but sometimes kadang-kadang niat baik but um you know it it just people will not understand or to to that someone it's how they see it
from then onwards I I macam I ah back off sort a little bit to really
ya ya correct cause correct tini told me ya sorry tini tini told me that um macam I've I don't open up to guys one like I've had this issues for years correct and when she she that's why she senyap this is the reason why she's being very quiet so this this all adds on to it and
um like I I get where she's coming from as well but then like that day she didn't turn up for the the birthday thing the the the laksa thing we were having I was pissed off lah I feel like macam you put it out there like people are get you trying to get to you macam nak buat sial kat kau you know but
fuck you up who would not do shit behind your back who still eh jom ah lepak even though for months you been eh come ah we pick for you freaking put her name on a cake babe no no thank you no sorry no what sort like
kau cakap dengan aku pasal something I don't go to ni
ah no I will never I I I will not it it is never my my macam um my intentions to ah
we and it for us like sometimes oh we talk about tini macam gini
but gossip is kau tahu dia ni
um in our macam friendship in the sense that for her to me is the trust which I for me macam
ah hati dia like she wants to jaga her feelings blah blah blah so I which I I
eh bilang aku bilang aku you know
friends if you don't fight then something is not right that means you're just saying things to the other person you know you need to gaduh ya and any relationship will have that macam you know macam ah ah apa err what what's that word ah friction exactly right and then it's how you talk about how it is after that how that person react
you know like how you you you take it you know whether you you make it big or things like that but I feel like is is is it's it's inevitable to gaduh in any relationship
ya it's not like there's no point of time where apa aku cakap too much then you don't tell me there are times like that vice versa you know it's like
kan pasal semua kena nak cakap kena beralas ah nak cakap nak kena
like you lah kita nak main game tak nak main ah jangan banyak cakap
kalau azmi lagi whoa
no I think he's macam sial
why why kenapa like why are you so macam anti natural things
ah macam ginger ke balms
err your mum masak or orh
ah dia orang nak pergi perang nak kena ada aircon juga sia kita singaporeans siol ah count on me singapore
ah then my mum like eh pergi buka tunjuk kat adrian fireworks then I tried to switch on my it wasn't there

actually it's very funny I was cause last weekend we were talking about kalau kita dah tua like duduk mana like you know and we just lepak somewhere where you know there's the sea or something you know um I was I was it's just funny I was just thinking about this if really like money is
sort of macam not a problem sort of right like I would probably macam ah tanam basil tanam

or like another matrep err slang ah aku kicap kau eh gua kicap sama lu

terus macam kau I remembered the first
time someone used that word kampung
but err we we wrote letters to each other right cause dulu tak ada tak ada social media
you know asal kau berbual dengan dia ni ah
then I'm like ah kita tulis surat ah then after that she's like tak ada sekarang kau kau dari mana punya kampung
gua mahu turun sekarang then
apa sia kampung
then she like kau kampung pun tak tahu sial kau ah kampung dia cakap gitu
terus aku then I felt so uncool I put down the phone and then I go ask my kakak angkat what is kampung so apparently ah kampung is like ah
kau budak mana it's like where are you
ah which gang are you from or like which area are you from you from like that lah then I was like oh abeh kira kita ni kampung apa aku tanya kakak angkat aku
and then ah she like kita budak marsiling ah cause last time I stay with my with my auntie ah in in woodlands vista point area then budak kita budak marsiling ah
then in my head in this secondary one two tak nak ah marsiling tapi kita tinggal woodland jauh seh dengan marsiling
I jalan and everyone that is that that like under the block and all that kan dia macam you can see from their face macam ni budak ni bukan dari sini so they will like try to see how you dress
got one guy go down tangga saw me
and then dia macam stop in the middle of tangga then I'm like uh turun jer lah kan
every one or two days there'll be raids there will be ya it's not even like macam old airport road like the raids once a month kind of thing here it's like every few days there are raids cause it's the border thing ah ya so like that
ya marsiling punya
marsiling gua kicap sama lu budak toa payoh
that one cina cina one ah I think
my client's house like you can just see people sitting at the staircase ya and then I like when I go out they look at me macam cause
their their eyes is like apa kau buat kat sini so I always make sure the next time to like bring files and bring
this group of boys tak ada judgment I I am surprised I think cause they are like
cause we we came from normal phones to social media right but they they are in the heart they are the woke sort of people so they they are more they they their eyes is more of like macam
ya then they bring the boy down suddenly cause we we tell them like if they just want to read for ten minutes fifteen minutes that's good enough kids first like boleh duduk diam like what sepuluh minit lima belas minit
but after that if they want to go down they want to lepak so they bring this boy to the playground main catching babe
main catching dengan budak-budak kat playground main bola main apa then I'm like
they even suss out um not influencers but artist sort of from other schools macam not famous but like one one thousand two thousand followers
and they do hip hop ke beatboxing they gather all these people come to hwa chong and they did a fundraiser all the money that we pay is like five dollars ten dollars goes to real life stories
alahai dah banyak privilege
lagi people sayanglah aku ni yang kat depan ni sial
mm lepas tu aku gi normal sebab aku boleh sports dalam rumah
it's like you would have like I don't know macam kau ada kan
tak ada script and you have obvious obviously you have a script in front of you you know you would have practice it at home
tak ada ke macam someone like err no one plays sports in the house go normal and
ya tak ada ke like just a
ah of of people's voice actually marwah punya ex ex secretary also so like the moment I heard that I told azmi like alright
yes my vote is not a secret undi awak adalah rahsia
aku tak tahu ah actually I feel like
aku tak tahu mana nak makan sia these days I feel like
oh aku nak cakap dengan kau just now okay so like since last week ah
I aku everyday datang balik sekolah to like do do my work
I started off early then at first the all all my paintings look good at first then tiba-tiba aku just macam
aku keep telling myself that aku ada banyak masa
then end up like push push everything until macam friday which is the set up day ya then aku last minute rush abeh like
dia dia macam confident gila lah that then she she was proud of her work
then uh all this while she okay lah I can see her effort ah that she did she did put in a lot of effort tapi dia punya dia punya
then dia berbual pasal hijab
then I I like I genuinely thought she would get good grades lah tapi tadi time assessment dia kena buat rabak gila ya
then err because err my work is painting paste dengan aku add four D element which is projector lah then err mm aku aku end up being the last because
I had to set up my mini projector then it's energy saving what so kirakan aku aku end up from register number five to aku jadi last
ya then aku nervous gila ah because like everybody like already presented then you know how like if you go first you cannot be compared with anybody then your if you are the last they see everyone's one even the good ones the bad ones they see everything already ya
ya then turns out they they they really like my work ya tapi like aku aku like just macam like because I felt like I didn't really do well you know
so dia dia leave lah in the middle of the
the presentation then err mm cause my artwork aku berbual pasal family then I don't know if it's because it's a very sensitive topic that's why dia orang macam tak berbual sangat pasal aku punya but then but then again right I had another classmate who like
err dia berbual pasal family then dia kena rabak script
lagi pun dia tak ada dia tak ada script
ya dia just berbual kan then she fumbled over her words ya ya
tiga because satu dapat err I don't know why but
err from the start dia cakap dia ada dengue
dia kena dengue then
ya then then he obviously had to stay home lah but it's been like since august sampai sekarang
ya I think he was hospitalized for like a while ni sampai ni dari august tau
ya tapi okay ah class lecturers ya satu presentation jer
but module sama oh what
ya tapi dia orang semua baik ah but
tapi sama sem
kita asyik tukar class
ya then last semester we were doing something else like we we experiment with like two D three D four D ya kau punya is kau terus masuk kau punya ya

figure drawing at least macam rilek rilek jer
ya tapi ini ini this one is under graphic comm ya lah
ya this time round kau ambil berapa eh oh ya aku kena six sia six credits ya then the the the packaging one was actually four credits and
tapi aku tak nak because it's like four hour class lama gila
asal kau tak ambil yang performing tu sia macam interesting jer
oh jadi macam tak match mismatch gitu lah
next semester kau ada professional development uh so like that course so it helps you like helps you like uh macam choose what ya then at the end of the semester tak salah aku we will have an artist speech
ya then artist speech kan you have to like really go all out for that one minute one minute jer tau kau boleh berbual and then they will invite artist to come then like on the spot if they like you they will hire you ya but I don't think I will get it that's the thing because because class aku ada banyak orang yang stand out

aiya cepat lah
siapa snoopy at the top
tak what is kemahiran is it like you needs and wants
serta-merta is
I don't know tak tahu lah
mahal-mahal go out when I think like I boleh masak kat rumah like just buy the ingredients and like learn to masak
those err lauk-lauk yang dekat restaurant restaurant ni semua
boleh gantung kat rumah my
ikan dia bawa ikan and then sepak me
saya rasa saya punya choice
mm pilihan
hmm dia
dia punya orang suka exercise sama macam saya dan
dia punya acting also quite
funny dalam quite lucu dalam cerita thor
but satu jam macam a bit
long lama
yes lagi dua puluh minit more
nasib baik the other one tu ada manual factory defect
tak sabar ah nak pindah ni
to bring the boxes but tadi
please ask bilang dia boleh boleh suruh pinjam kereta dia or what
kerusi kena pasang kan kalau tak nanti orang jatuh
ya all all the dining table kena semua kena screw
have to wait pasal diorang belum pasang lagi
I think letak dulu also can
supposed to be white what all but now got hitam-hitam I don't know why
hmm it looks kotor
ya it looks macam ada mould
suruh suruh diorang nanti anuh putih balik ah
err shum um shum I mean shum my mother did say lah if spray nanti bila panas it will crack and then it will peel so it will not is not nice lah
we can just paint the pipes black but the hot water tu we just tinggalkan like leave it uh like as it is
the water pipe my brother say semalam tak pasang pasal
the counter top belum kering lagi so they have to wait for it to
stick so before they will pasang a'ah because ni semua diorang baru tampal
quite okay what yang ni
mak ya we can go but
definitely banyak orang mesti we have to bangun pagi lah
we cannot like dilly-dally pukul sebelas pergi we have to go like nine
they have sambal goreng the have begedil
sotong sambal sotong I'm not sure
no it's macam like um no
but macam like wasted lah because we've already
dah buat laminate for that
if it's from the start kita bilang diorang just do it as like a bare
we can boleh buat the wallpaper lah
this okay what ni hmm hmm hmm
isn't that macam kat
it's at ubi no
yang tempat kita makan prawn mee tu lah no
no back back lagi lagi
oh ni yang tu lah kita beli lampu vision kan
don't know tak tahu
tak lawa sangat lah
that one has to be like macam
two minute two minute tadi tu kat bawah
it's very melayu
this is for the belakang or what
tengok lah so lah
I mean we could ask if it's like macam like hundred dollars
why don't kita just no just
and maybe like maybe during hari raya time we wanna change
this quite cute ni
okay dah dah
okay so from my understanding right apa tu
the kadi is you book the kadi from the website right okay so and then you don't actually contact them apa tu
takpe lah it's okay ah
it's okay tak payah banyak-banyak then ya
oh okay jadi kalau kadi tu macam stay further but you select that kadi because you prefer also okay lah oh
boleh ah
tapi I have to wait until the date I want available first right so I cannot do in advance right
oh I see that means kalau if six of june I still have to wait until sixth of june available then I go in and register
oh I I I I takut what or not I takut go in ah then I click click click click right then suddenly right it submitted then my date right not available then if I need to amend kan then is charges takde eh
tapi on that day is your date available already lah on the
oh I see so kirakan before the date available
you go in you select the kadi so err I mean you play with the form tapi you don't submit
oh I I was thinking of doing that tapi macam takut tersubmit then you amend changes
later have to pay the difference ah the the charges ah and then ya so but I was also curious ah I want to see the form right and what is this question required because because my date is a double date so will be very err sought much sought sought after lah so don't want to make the mistake ah then that time you book masa tu nya err it's a sunday
mesti popular kan but then err
takut tak dapat kan
dia punya cause the dad is bukan is a non-muslim jadi kena cari kadi kadi tak banyak cuma ada sepuluh ke I think sepuluh then
oh I think about ten ah ya but dia ada lagi satu err punya susah lah pasal um dia nya kadi kan dia tak boleh apa tu
err kalau buat dekat err location lain kan dia nya kadi cannot be yang full time staff
so full time staff sana ada about tiga orang so out of the ten
I only can pick seven then from that seven I think got two or two not fluent in english ah so my err number of kadi shrink shrink then entah abeh sekarang nowadays I cannot see the kadi reviews on the web eh dulu got or not I saw a lot of the video being recorded previously
he's okay he's fast I prefer pasal dia nya dia nya style is like
berbual sikit then go
ah itu lah ada satu err kadi tu dia quite quite
very eloquent ah tapi bila I tengok dia nya video kan
ya pasal sekarang I know yang satu kadi ni yang I identified this salim jasman I saw
cara dia buat macam betul relax ah err he just
tapi bagus ah because you tak ingat then that means also no stress lah bila baca baca jer ah
ya ya ya it sounds it sounds baku ya
ya lah ya lah tapi berbual macam berbual bahasa melayu pun kelakar juga ya
tapi yang kadi tu is your family punya err acquaintance ah
oh tapi by then you don't know who that colleague is lah
okay mm okay jadi kirakan my plan sekarang is to go to the website fill up all the details then tapi bila dia punya date available submit straight mm
oh tapi dia to submit is there's a submit button right as long you don't submit it won't go through kan okay
mm okay same here okay jadi kalau time slot dia is err macam mana tu satu kadi can have more than one time slot ah
okay and then the charges untuk err this registration ada tak
tapi the marriage prep course tak payah kan
tapi yang yang dia tanya tu is masa jumpa kadi
okay yang dia interview tu is
yourself your err bride the the wakil
the wakil from your your wali ah
okay so so sebelum interview dengan kadi is you jumpa the head of the first
oh so jadi yang dekat tu jumpa dia punya punya
oh and tu masa during that time will be the time dia minta to any prep marriage prep course or he ask you to go ah oh that's after oh
okay berapa eh
tiga ratus lebih kan I think dengar-dengar macam tiga ratus lebih
okay oh dia masa tahun bila baru dia cakap tak compulsory eh
huh ye ke oh okay
harus ah
betul juga wah tapi masa tu tak ada wedding cake
pasal dia single single layer kan
ye lah ye lah
tapi yang cake ni is is actually not a muslim right is west western culture ya okay
sekarang nowadays they offer macam hotel one they offer dummy cake just to for the photo taking
oh yang jaga makeup okay
mm mm nowadays got pak andam
mm pasal nak ikat dia punya bunga eh
tapi sekali jer kan maybe before the dia nikah jer kan
tapi mak andam sampai the whole day mah
sama lah
cuma cuma dia punya masa tu thinking is dia nak pergi sana cepat so dia ada time to makeup lah tapi
for bride lah ya you dah plan pe
oh tu tak boleh jadi
tapi kalau orang dah bayar untuk tu semua mana boleh seh
kirakan sekarang ni macam they are macam err they messed up the err planning
some some some mak andam because they because they want to do their part which is so they the the main thing is they make messed up the planning lah okay
okay dia panic lah okay
kirakan flexible lah okay okay uh huh
mm jadi kirakan kalau macam if we do nikah and wedding different place that's where the problem comes
oh kirakan bukan pasal delay pasal they earn more lah no lah we we already paid them for that whole day so inclusive
tapi oh but you know how their charges are is like per whole oh not oh
mm tapi prata okay
okay jadi mak andam is not requirement unless you have err several outfit change
oh okay okay jadi sama lah I think for my side I think I don't want to have mak andam I want to have like the makeup artiste is okay and also to see whether I have err ya
I I even thought of what you know because dekat err katong sana kan there are many err salon ya then we thought err go there early ya
ya cause very close eh because yang grand mercure ada banyak salon ya how good ah that's why I have to go there okay
ya dia pun I email juga mm
most likely we also will do the same thing lah kita tak akan ambil mak andam jadi ah the day macam one off saja lah
oh okay mak andam is for rental cause they got special rate
tapi of course photography on the same day is the best lah cheapest ah cheapest lah because you do makeup all that
oh okay so we do the nikah and the photography after that
paling senang dekat dalam hotel tu tak boleh gerak-gerak
mm ya dia nya swimming pool I ever went it looks nice lah so I think I need to ask the person on that day
three three err I think for for your case kan tiga jam macam okay ah very manageable
apa yang teething problems
the because of the shortage of space right the clearance of the the food I I saw is a problem aku outside mah but I can see people no space sit ya
pasal panas oh ya lah hari tu memang panas jadi yang dekat err lawn tu mostly budak-budak parents semua tak pergi seh ah
ya I I I also saw a lot of people came to witness the nikah
for for my case okay lah terus settle
cause for for err the place I have right there's a stage jadi kalau kirakan okay I was think I can rent for three hours three hours so I thought the nikah start at eleven thirty
lagi-lagi kalau apa tu like what you said
betul juga tapi wedding memang ah orang macam panic kan jadi ada sikit problem sikit lah cuma apa tu
the itinerary so example eleven thirty my nikah so
nikah plus err tea ceremony ya
ya lah siapa nak ikut to the letter kan yes
okay cause I thought the nikah and the tea ceremony will be done the first thing in the morning
kirakan I want to like macam eleven thirty to one for example is nikah tea ceremony and then
that's also the time kalau nak tukar baju pun boleh tukar lah
okay tapi kalau COVID dia ada different kind of rules ah only the twenty percent will be selected you can mingle
err out of that twenty they have to be in their table oh but mungkin maybe masa tu policy belum start ah tapi I went to the Grand Mercure right and err
kalau ada COVID infection ah
okay I see but only worry like err yang table yang tak mingle boring ah duduk tengok each other makan cannot mix with the you know
kalau ah
pasal your wedding lain tau your wedding can mingle is a is different cause err your time can be taken ah you know speaking ah
simple simple hmm okay kalau ah
kalau if I
hmm okay okay oh I itu yang category macam err emcee ah yang macam too much lah that's why
I kena fikir juga pasal ni
that is one thing then ya baju you all buy the fabric then make at the joo chiat right
some more is if my date considered is during the syawal tau so have to do it early okay okay lagi apa lagi eh
pasal is it pasal melayu punya photographer oh oh ah
ya nasib baik dewi is not so
you ada kawan
yang boleh yang ada recommend recommend
for photography I tak tahu seh really I
oh ya pandai apa apa pose yes yes
kirakan macam know how to live up the atmosphere then ya
tapi the that time your punya photographer is the that guy is not that good
younger guy was good he was very err dia punya social skills good ah
ya tapi at least dia tahu I mean ya
okay ah terperanjat gue sial lah
err lepas the normal ambil gambar on the dais lepa stu after lunch or
cause I remember you ada macam speech eh tak ada eh so everything
tapi before the ending you all go around each table ambil gambar with everybody ah
okay jadi
hello hi so kita nak start buat err recording

we still have cikgu suhanis till there what
cikgu iza also still there

they have primary school ke
the form aje
ah cerita cerita apa ah yang the worst witch
it's about this uh kid lah abeh dia ada power but then dia dia macam harry potter tapi it's about females it's witches
quite fun lah to pass time pasal sekarang aku dah tak kerja apa abeh tengah tunggu cari kerja kan so I just watch like whatever I can find lah on netflix then that popped out so I watch it it's not bad got four seasons and each episode macam empat puluh minit gitu
tapi dia orang pun baru pe so that kind of standard pe
abeh sekarang kau masih bayar untuk netflix
berbulan-bulan ya berapa ah dia orang naik harga kan
banyak benda sia naik harga my google drive also naik harga
I haven't seen any updates on it but I know google dah ada
assignment apa sia
I mean it will get better lah I mean yang COVID ni semua bukan like forever what they're working for a cure so maybe in a year maybe in a few months it will get better tak tahu ah
tengok ah
we're still alive so might as well might as well find something to hold on cari kerja ke start business ke
kau nak buat business apa sia
but ada juga ah macam sikit
abeh kau masih beli benda kat habbo
mm masih spend like hundreds of dollars on buying credits
but like you planning on staying or like once they move over to a new platform are you gonna like quit or like jual your benda and quit or
banyak sangat benda kan
not like what if it gets worst macam like dia orang remove banyak benda from the game then orang semua macam tak nak main
I think dia orang macam tak fikir they gonna cause
macam like to them at the end of the day kita like we we like the game so much that like no matter what they do also we still continue buying we still continue playing
macam like some items they release and then they increase the price to like thirty five when previously was twenty five and then orang masih beli pe it's not they like everyone just okay no I'm not gonna buy anymore
habis smite apa jadi
oh really cause I know that day uh siapa naim asked uh ilyas to join but then ilyas said like the file was like twenty one he couldn't even download it anymore after he deleted everything from his laptop
mm four days ago three days ago ya macam
the file got too big for ilyas so like dia tak boleh download then sampai dia have to delete everything and try again couldn't
ya that's why ah ilyas dia cakap dengan aku like oh I cannot play with you cause sekarang dia main among us jer
I think baru ah like three days maybe three days ago ya
I don't know but dia cakap dia delete semua benda tinggal yang programme files
like dia basically formatted his ya
dia cakap dulu file dia macam fourteen and then then after that it went up to sixteen lepas tu sekarang dah dua puluh satu
cause that time dia cakap dia punya app ada issue lah he couldn't log in so dia delete then bila dia nak redownload balik tak boleh
so dia format like remove everything from dia punya lepas tu semua benda like he tried to download download download and then couldn't so he just give up
that'll be cool though can you imagine yang character character dia semua jadi spongebob punya character macam mister crab sandy
probably go with good looks but I mean pasal kalau
badan sapau pun I mean you can just go to the gym boleh pergi gym boleh pergi like have a like a regimented like exercise routine for yourself and then you probably could get that tapi kalau nak muka baru I mean you can't really do that also what so probably good looks
ya I guess banyak banyak duit at least about ten K for a nose or something I don't even know probably will be too much but like kalau nak like make yourself fitter and stuff boleh pergi lari and like exercise and stuff and then you're there it's fine so probably good looks
I mean to a certain extent semua orang pun macam at least a bit ah
with like the fitness level and stuff I mean unless you're like one of those like super athlete and stuff lah kalau tak then there's really like no point
after this I don't know never really have a plan today but kalau
kalau ni hari not much lah I'm just going to go home and like rest but like kalau esok maybe maybe I might go cut my hair
nak potong rambut pasal dah panjang haven't dah lama belum potong rambut so maybe I shall do that
rasa macam free kan
sekarang muka macam maybe I want to keep it a bit like short but not too short macam medium length gitu lah tak nak panjang sangat pun
kalau kat rumah hmm
netflix lepas tu
main and playing a bit of
apa lagi ah
uh no I haven't played cause like I don't know macam
main dengan naim and muhammad they very competitive and then like if ilyas is not there like can't really
so I usually kalau dia orang dua jer then I I avoid
but like kalau the rest main then aku main ah cause I
I mean the same thing happened bila that time I tried to download kat my macbook apa
cause I don't think they have a punya file
oh ya kalau satu benda dapat rumah ah
I mean kalau kalau kau dah ada rumah then at most kau kerja untuk
maybe your savings and then like sikit untuk makan minum bills
we move to an island yang tak ada orang
uh pergi ah
so what the cow is the hantu or like
maybe orang maybe like someone like dulu simpan lembu kat rumah abeh dia bawa
the latest the one I think just got removed what the kampung
I don't know buangkok some some no as in like an actual kampung macam
uh orang dia tinggal dalam rumah macam kayu ya
yang that time I went there untuk yang satu filming for this
cerita hantu ah
ya went there and then dia orang cakap uh tempat tu memang ada benda ah like there's there's actual hantu living there ya
and then like there's this one makcik ah like this chinese auntie
abeh dia orang cakap macam um like kalau datang kat rumah tu kena macam have like
good intentions like you can't be there to macam
she said like kalau nampak apa-apa jangan tegur lah just let it be
we film from I think like we arrived there at six ah so we set up and stuff and then the actress for the hantu was late
and then we had to delay and then wait then um when the actress finally came I had to put her and line her punya costumes and makeup and stuff
so like she became the hantu it was quite quite interesting to see her change ah cause
dia ah she's like I think some
abeh kita kena tukar muka dia jadi macam hantu and then it's kind of fun lah but macam
and then we had to put in contact lenses and stuff and it's not the normal yang kecil punya contact lenses it's a full eye one
we were kind of worried lah that wouldn't work out but then like at the end she was okay with it so thank god lah like nasib ah
benda tu jadi so quite cool and like it was quite kind of scary ah to see her in the dark
ya lah but then it's the only kampung I know that exists in singapore lah
that kampung
they are very nice and then the when we were there kita nampak macam uh tiga caucasian people ang moh like white people
they were like dia orang datang abeh dia orang tengok tengok ah then dia orang nampak then kita punya filming punya benda then dia macam oh what you're doing
they like oh okay cool cool and jalan
quite a few like um there's a lot of kampung houses lah but macam maybe ada lima ke enam orang jer tinggal sana banyak rumah yang tak ada orang ah
that's the thing I don't really know I only know the auntie like her job is to mainly take care of that kampung
so macam she does the upkeeping and stuff ah and then like I know there's there's like one that they that
like ada kerusi-kerusi semua kat luar abeh macam I know that that place they close down already so I don't know what they use the space for
ya it's very close it's like macam kalau
dia like here and then it's just kat bawah
ya it's quite interesting it's like surrounded by blocks and roads but then once you enter the kampung area you really feel like you end up somewhere else cause
besar juga ah like maybe it's about the size of like one small area
like maybe like eight blocks gitu
it's all kayu and then like very old school lah semua macam
stay in the kampung
ya it's quite gelap I mean there there is a few street lights ah like around the area but it's quite dark and then um
tempat dia memang besar like really quite big ya
like explore like one small corner of it cause bila kita masuk kita naik lorry kena bawa semua equipment kan so when we brought it all out we just put it at the house there and then we were only at that house
aku datang just tengok-tengok abeh like macam tolong sini tolong sana
ya dah pukul lapan gitu then she came over
then she was like kau orang nampak apa-apa tak and I'm like um no and then she said like kalau kalau nampak apa-apa tak payah takut nothing one
dia hantu baik then I'm like okay
if I wanted to explore and then go to places I think I will tunggu malam baru keluar cause panas sangat like everyday it's so humid and hot
tiga tahun eh it's quite recent sia
but like kesian juga ah like you when you tengok the polar bear it's just so skinny and frail looking and like it was alone that in its entire life I think
I want go yang tempat apa tu yang dekat gardens by the bay ah
pergi satu kali ah when in maybe secondary school
tiga wish
oo okay lah kalau dia orang nak kasih free ambil jer lah kalau kalau bayar then okay ah aku bingit but then kalau free
then collect dekat dekat rumah aku okay lah and
I mean ya memang ah like buang masa juga cause
they tell you like oh you you don't need the code I mean you need the token thing abeh it's not like it's as if you walk past and scan it you have to actually bring to the person to scan
but I don't think macam
kat bawah block
huh sini takde banyak kucing
only got lembu
have you seen your cat luar
seram sia
you know when I first got my cat it was that bad lah macam
hmm bila like I have carry the cat and stuff my nose will like start like getting blocked then I'll be coughing
abeh batuk rabak sia it's like cannot breathe and stuff
sekarang if I carry him it's still fine but like my face gets itchy ah like if he comes too close like my face
and then kalau when I mandi him like
ya I mean like really at what point do we stop having to macam pursue technology
the president speaks in malay kau orang semua stop it eh
can you imagine like in the courtroom the judge is just like okay I think kau dah bunuh orang ni tapi I just I just want to give you a warning eh kau stop jer eh jangan buat lagi tau

 masyaallah
 tak you know  kau tengok kalau kau tengok ni timer  sekarang koi not bad ah
oo  merepek lah  dia ni
ah  buka buka
confirm  dua tiga jam lepas eh
ah  habis
oh okay  lepas tu dia dah keluar awal sikit lah
 dah agak dah
mm he was  kau okay lah I mean  betul apa betul apa betul apa
 betul lah  betul
 dia tak dia tak dia tak salah ah  dia tak salah
 dah janji lapan setengah
you know  biasanya kalau kau nak cari
ya ya ya  nak jumpa girlfriend sia  tapi sekarang engkau jumpa kawan right bro
um fifty betul
so maknanya kalau uh kalau if you yang in ten years time memang you want to be in an area yang ada laut yang ada greenery where
kalau untuk saya for me eh I think eh
I would like to live in my own lab atau garage
and maybe sebelah would be my like lab apparatus ke apa ke
so if I have my own lab I would probably uh maybe add a telescope atau like some meeting devices so that I can
mmhmm betul
katanya if say let's say you were
martial arts gitu
uh any political issues ya so I think it's very stimulating for me and um I think it it it gives me like macam
yang satu orang ni uh she was actually uh she was actually trapped in a spaceship
computed her body into into a technological uh into a computer-generated programme so meaning her colleagues and herself were actually in a spaceship and they have no control of returning or whatsoever because their was generated fun fact it was actually their clone ah orang sendiri tau so
so the boss memang memang jahat ah gilanya orang
like their their image you know what I mean faham tak ya so an image of them self you mean nak ah macam
ah ada fit body atau good looks
I think I agree on that lah sebab kalau kalau sekiranya macam ada wajah yang cantik pun eh tapi kalau macam if you can't like run
ten miles when you don't have the stamina or the health then buat apa lah
ya so I think for me kalau ada fit body is more satisfying sebab
for health is technically is more is the is the most important thing for you to live in this in this world lah sebab without without health actually um you can be bedridden and even the the cost of uh
so macam I think health is very important lah sebab without health memang you tak boleh buat much lah you can't do much actually
kena start awal lah
so I think one kalau pot from having a fit body eh
like all you said a healthy body I think it's also important to have a healthy mind sebab sekarang memang as you can see eh mental health is very prevalent especially among the youth err among the working adults and among um teens
cara holistic lah
I think mental health also like uh stems from other external factors macam maybe overwhelming of
school work atau
probably they cannot handle the stress that they have lah that they experience so um like if you can see like the education system kat singapore sekarang memang very uh
it's very intense lah so like what macam
for for me because I've I've I've been in the education system and macam memang I've been schooling ah and I think macam there's a lot of
but tu memang
but it doesn't really appease them so I think macam apparently the education system has been the same for more than hundred years but uh everything has been changing and revolutionised
uh it gives not only education to students or to everyone but it helps them to learn or or you train their mind on how to learn not what to learn because I feel that every every single time my friends when they enter school when they enter when they when they take test they actually memorise everything and I think that's very futile it's pointless sebab apa tau if you memorise everything
then we won't learn anything we're just spitting out whatever you learn or and you macam just just kasi semua on paper but you don't actually learn or having or you don't even get the gist of it like for example even in exams they ask you
macam apparently to some students maybe it maybe it just stimulate their practical thinking but what students don't like chemistry or physics lah and ya I think I don't don't think they will find the benefit in learning that or applying that in life so maybe it's a it's a good discussion bila macam
macam susah lah kan
mm okay so contohnya like for now eh we are in the twentieth twenty first century
cuba like for example eh you ternampak a time capsule
I think that's pun what I would really macam really cherish enjoy
I don't know maybe zaman rasulullah atau dark ages ah cause um basically the dark ages were macam a period of time
the macam
rolab and I think those were the ages where where there were a lot of inventions like you know the sultans of science bila there's this two brothers
I think it's very interesting to see macam
the the progression during that period of times sebab sebab during that time memang memang tak ramai orang ada tak ramai orang dapat keluarkan idea macam gitu
during the golden age and I find it really interesting sebab how their mind
even in engineering and science and uh it can do like a lot of things at once and I think that's something that's um macam kita jarang tengok ah
dalam dunia ni sekarang tau most of the time kan kadang-kadang macam contohnya eh I have to um contohnya I have to pursue the road after my O levels just for engineering will it set where I want to go maybe not but I like to pursue maybe engineering medicine uh philosophy literature of course I like to learn a lot of things at once lah but I think macam ya I think it'll be very interesting lah kalau you can like learn
tak sampai mana-mana macam ilmu ni bukan terak laginya luas kalau kita dapat ilmu tu kita just go far
sebab ilmu tu mana-mana and you can use for ilmu ilmu ilmu payah ke ilmu
ilmu apa tu pengetahuan ke apa as long as kita ada ilmu kita gunakan dengan baik and I think it will be very fruitful lah
um duit ke rumah ke
or war actually can be stopped cause technically um itu lah kalau boleh share but technically like uh world hunger among there are many um palestinians
hunger itself is very it's hard to address because poverty is it might be out of reach to most of us and especially during this COVID eh macam susah seh orang nak macam macam nak dicakap ada sebab memang now orang eh actually tengah kelaparan yang kadang tak ada kerja yang tak ada no access to macam
so I think um having a family really macam
and kalau ada suami I would be able to
find solace in him cause memang allah turunkan kita dalam pasangan kan so I think having a spouse would be very interesting lah
akhlak yang baik lah
macam I can feel you lah I think having uh having status
even if you want me to have good akhlak
tak ada gunanya kalau kita ada akal okay kita tak
hancur tau
akhlak is more valuable lah than intellect
akhlak lah actually even if you have your own
buat yang baik lah
you tak ada gunanya
maybe like um what do you think if you macam kiranya kalau kita ada macam superpower
kalau you ada superpower like you nak jadi apa kalau what what what will you like to have right now
kalau ada barang nak kemas inshallah lah
kalau you know I rasa
sebab kalau I dapat teleport kan
I takkan lambatnya cause I'm like always late kalau dapat teleport then macam on on the speed of light or even faster than that uh just like be wherever I want to be just teleport tak tak payah nak passport semua so I think that's very cool ah kalau kalau kalau dapat teleport lah
I think the current technology memang tak boleh lah unless kita ada transporter macam kat star trek ke but of course not lah
tapi contohnya eh kalau macam now's the kalau cause sekarang memang is in progress lah what what do you think of
phones pun is a machine so that's the that's functions in it
sekarang google jer
I think okay lah maybe salah saya juga sebab phone tu memang it serves like an educational purpose lah
ya and the entertainment purpose untuk zaman sekarang
they don't have emotions or they lack like dopamine serotonin in especially in humans humans ada this kind of chemicals
you can react to certain things tapi macam they are programmed to do these things and then what happens are like programmed to weaponise or kill people I think that will be very scary in the future where yeah it's very scary hopefully can be used for good
cause it's very um like in the future it's very unknown but in a sense that you think I think agaknya also I feel it's on the good side lah because
important I think apart from that I think macam humans should actually still take care of their parents and macam don't just leave them do it by themselves because technically humans we need to feel interaction and contohnya macam
uh like a like a constructor or telecomm imagine they cannot address questions then macam mana seh kan
ada limit to it
I think one dia macam pun very subjective lah sebab kita orang tak tahu like in the future what is the government's plan what are the engineers' plan
I think ya technically macam you can see like the the human population of the world is can be overpopulated and also at some
some regions in the world macam india they are very overpopulated kalau kita dah ada robot lagi mana nak letak seh human ni so apart from like apart from like moving to mars or europa I think will be very difficult lah sebab you have to find a contingency plan sebab memang dunia ni maybe won't be enough for the for the rest of the human beings and to house robots so maybe very interesting lah to actually to predict and cause nowadays memang
humans dorang betul-betul kena
but I think I understand right I think would be good to counter people for example people who likes to kill or like or or who likes to start war for even even macam greedy greedy people who are in like in charge of companies if can actually take charge of
can take can take charge of a certain organisation or and if they have the capacity to do that maybe even even a better capacity than a human being I think it'll be very interesting to see lah sebab um some people like humans like if we if we discuss we have emotions have impulses we have intentions but for they don't have that they can only follow whatever you they are programmed to do so probably the risk of making mistakes will be lesser
orang melayu ah or like someone who belajar melayu
you rasa
to improve dorang punya
yes belum keluar
oh kat yang bedok is it tanah merah
apa tu err
and I got like three days off you know how I told you macam I
sepuluh hari lagi left
slowly slowly ah slowly gila
ya but they didn't look at more on strengths uh they didn't even ask anything about the weaknesses so I think a bit macam
ah macam gitu lah ya
but apa tu
the apa tu the
kurang ajar seh kurang ajar gila
it's not it's tak compulsory tapi macam
eh asal you tak baca dulu sebelum you buat paper
okay I think that was me in in apa tu in
secondary school also when kita buat lit
okay jap
speedy ni
speedy tak tahu lah
dia tak nak berbual dengan kita pastu selalu gini tau like everytime dia
everytime kita nak everytime I want to talk to him right then he always run away but then when we don't need him around he's always ya he's always around like what the hell
okay lah okay lah tak cukup attention
tak cukup apa tak cukup attention kesian dia
but apa tu
so dia baru join
because there was this other person but he selalu
ya it was quite rabak uh
err apa tu err
ya lah abeh nak mandi semua
so anyway he told me that lah he told me macam
so macam he was damn lost ah
my language classes then dia macam
dia macam tak cakap apa-apa never say anything so aku macam okay
ya so it's a bit macam give me some heads up uh
tu lah
like ya I cannot force people like I cannot paksa orang to
datang and you know
and then macam it makes more sense for me to follow other people's schedule but like
I have to really plan macam straight away after finish
pastu keluar lepak and then go straight to work atau sleep a bit more and
tidur jer kerja
ya and because my shift pukul berapa pukul tiga
no takde takde takde
no they dorang big fans of macam the workflow and all that even though it's a bit more chill uh actually
tu lah maksud dia
ya around different workflows different deliverables everything ah because it's a totally lain punya client ya
ya she she took chemistry in the pastu um
that I've been very complacent macam I've
not complacent macam terlalu banyak
err oh yang ni jangan nak kena betul-betul tengok the the deadline and all that
abeh kita proofreading we put everything ah like whether the date is correct
the numbering and all that and the oh categorisation and all that is betul
macam whether they
whether they apa tu
volunteer because kita punya kerja kan banyak ada nak kena chope
macam you must chope certain deliverables lah
correct so like every morning okay I tell you the process of macam mana kita kerja
okay so pukul tiga setengah I bangun
let's say pukul lima we have to send headlines
because I'm the kind of person yang I cannot tunggu for people
like I'm not a apa tu
that was last time uh remember I told you there was like one time in between july sampai
september ke august
just jaded like macam
so dorang macam lepas tangan cepat-cepat
orang ketiga lah
apa benda home wrecker
no I think dorang nak more natural conversation so that
I know lah but macam we are talking directly to you know now we have to like just have a conversation between ourselves so that you know in the future we are actually helping
I don't know takut it's not because I don't they also never say like what
kesian seh
ya what have you been watching lately cerita
good tak it looks like very old
berapa episode berapa season
satu jer ada
okay bagus
ya it's so sad uh banyak
banyak but
shows nak kena
either like postpone their dorang punya release because of COVID
bila dia when is it supposed to be
ya same as apa tu yang mugen train also what it was released quite super damn early in apa tu
in japan lepas tu like only came in singapore berapa bulan jer nanti
ya macam
not transfer macam how they send over copies to
macam but what what cloud can carry that then how we have google drive
ya I'm I'm so interested in that macam I think that's what
to datang in like in a dalam ada bawa briefcase
wait so back then actually dah ada
err apa tu portrait on
ah nak kasi nanti lah sekejap lagi
ya twenty more minutes sayang
speedy nak say something
okay tunggu kejap jer just now I give you food you don't want to take
pastu macam gini ah how how how anyhow like that can ah
tak don't breathe on the thing
ya macam
apa tu err different types of
jap eh do you want anything from pasir ris
tak nak my brother can get Gong Cha you want
ya macam
then macam
I don't know lah there could be those directors yang very macam oh I need this shot
I need this shot it needs to be this particular way you know macam
ya what what kind of movie would you film melayu
would it be more macam
embodies that the most yang paling
paling like paling dekat show that the kind of movie that you like
okay more prominent ones yang kita tengok Handmaiden tu was it good
mm macam the food change eh food chain
wah takde movies what movies is
you know what I mean like you it makes you think macam oh my god whoa
but like you know when he went through the apa tu
kan ada I don't know whether the lady or the man yang cakap
if dia go through the door
did we watch another movie together about the the cerita indonesia
yang ugh was I with you
it was this cerita pasal
who had to balik to balik kampung sebab
dia nak reconnect dengan family dia ke apa
ke oh dia nak dia nak cari
remember yang dia hang baju pastu
cerita apa eh
yes yes yes that one yang tu yang tu
will you do it on your own or will you like go out to like uh tanya or ask anyone I don't know
but this kind of thing definitely need macam to set up to set aside like at least
oh yes you're right you're right betul betul betul
betul betuls okay lah
cute gila oh my god it's very cute
ya ya I dah wash lagi I dah basuh
I dah kering
I dah apa lagi err vocabulary boleh kasi dorang
I kering I dah squeeze dry
I dah compress tu jer
ya I dah I've done quite a lot of things lah
ya so as in it's drying now tengah nak kering I'll show you later you can try if you want to take home
bawa balik ah mana satu yang you nak
because it all looks so pretty semua lawa gila
dia macam those who know will know right
and then people think like err this girl anyhow only does she even know the movie dia tahu ke tak tahu ni dia main pakai jer
ya we've talked about this before berbual
like you know how when it when it's macam when it's very a niche group of people watching a niche show right it makes the show more special
dia macam it feels a bit cheaper because like
oh now they are going more mainstream lebih mainstream
popularity of macam demon slayer for example
not as popular of course lah but macam ya so like
it's easier for me to buy merch let's say merchandise nak beli nak beli apa lagi
ya macam these merchandise nak beli baju you know
ya lah but macam if you if it were another show for example macam Fruits Basket
atau I don't know what's another show I don't hear it err hunter by hunter X hunter
quite popular eh macam you know what I mean
well known so macam that's why I say there's pros and cons ah
you tahu kan I ada classmate jepun in my korean class
so dia
so macam most of us kita ambil sebab kita either
kita tengok cerita K drama dengar lagu K-pop or like you know just korean artist
so I asked her like oh how about ya so I asked her macam
and she say macam
macam real people
the life in japan macam how was her school life or like at least lah
she's quite nice lah then she shared with me like about her school life uh how dia kerja part time
quite interesting ah it's it's I love this class because macam
and like the eleven year old punya remember I berbual pasal
cute gila
ya because like I like I talk to her about macam my trip to yogyakarta the like last year
and then she would share with me about her time also macam in jakarta and how dia rindu lah rindu gila dengan jakarta tapi she she feels like
she will definitely stay in singapore for a bit because this place paling
tak kat yishun not at yishun
and then um dia macam I don't know
korean like I can ask where the toilet is I can ask how much and understand how much a certain item is I just it'll take me awhile to um calculate lah because dorang punya numbering is very susah gila it's like
dorang count kan dorang punya currency besar gila kan
correct hyperinflation like of indonesia sama juga
so nak kena you must really calculate lah
banyak fikir ah I feel like it's easier for me to write then it is for me to speak which is not a good thing because you're supposed to be able to speak better because you're learning a language
exactly but macam
ya I just have to keep practising but I have no one to practise with at work also no one wants to layan my korean I feel like I'm such a
lawa gila it's very it's super damn it's super nice

I mean kalau pergi mana-mana
I tak cerita sebanyak kalau nak pergi mana tapi yang penting err
if I were to go travel I I got a plan like I mean not so plan but if like if anybody got any suggestion eh why not we go to this place pergi tempat ni lah macam best jer ah I just ikut jer ah you punya orang kita lah how about you
and winter will be interesting because tak pernah experience salji macam salji mesti lah sejuk kan tapi from what I know ah
tengok pokok-pokok ah pokok lupa nama dia tapi it's pink in colour merah jambu pokok tu tengok macam dekat bila kita jalan ambil gambar pun cantik apa kan so cantik jer pokok tu I think I like pretty stuff lah I mean who doesn't like pretty stuff like when you take photo it will look good on you so ya
what's the name for the ya so I'll bring them to kampung glam because of I remember masa time dulu ah sekolah rendah sekolah menengah kan mesti ada field trip like they will bring us to a few places in singapore then we can just enjoy right so I remember going to kampung glam
and masa tu time tu sekolah rendah lah dia orang bawa kita pergi ah
it was very interesting at first sight because ah I mean kita kalau macam mana nak cakap ah kita orang melayu pun kadang-kadang pun tak pergi tempat yang kita punya culture where where it is what so it's like when I go there
it's interesting because I found interesting games macam permainan-permainan orang dulu suka main ah macam gasing or chapteh lagi ada five stones there are five stones
so ya I think I am more attracted dengan dia punya permainan-permainan orang-orang dulu lah oh ada lagi ada congkak dia orang pun ada jual congkak dia ada lagi jual macam-macam lah macam-macam permainan lah macam permainan dulu-dulu I think I'm
I would not say I grew up watching it lah how how would I explain it dulu masa sekolah rendah tak tengok drama korea macam cuma drama melayu macam dekat channel five I mean I do watch channel eight too sometimes because of my sister
so I I bet everybody knows this so masa tu macam ah eh tengok ah boys over
flowers best tau cerita dia ah cerita dia pasal sekolah perempuan ni perempuan ni dia pergi sekolah kat sekolah orang kaya-kaya then nanti dia berkawan empat lelaki ni then I was like
oh okay mula dengar macam oh okay then when I watched I was like okay it's it's getting more interesting because of the twist and the plots of the story so I'm like I'm so down to it I'm so like and I end up watching the the whole full episode so it was
like people using fake profiles macam dia orang pakai gambar orang lain habis lepas tu gunakan dekat laman sosial macam gitu then orang mesti macam eh I want tinggi wah cik lawa ah buat kawan ah kan
aku dah mesti nak tunggu kau nak bantu kau I'm here for you like you know
macam dalam dunia ni itu kan macam movie ah tu kan based on
non-fiction what so it's like bila ada movie macam gini macam wah macam dia orang pakai macam magic wand they use like a lot of stuff to to to cast a spell on someone or to fight someone it's like
three hours is because uh they add in like musics and a lot of stuff because that is their culture what ya when making movies lah but this is interesting it's because of the movie it's just clear cut it's just it's very mysterious one thing and it's very unique is because it ah it dia ada macam crime crime scene kat dalam tu
so macam never seen a movie like that before like usually it's just dancing then you like
teletubbies punya patung I mean I tak collect banyak lah I mean I don't have much but I remember I had like two two of the characters I think one one is the yellow yellow is called laa-laa another one is ah
own macam dia orang ada macam dia orang punya character dia orang ada macam barang macam tinky-winky ada handbag kalau dipsy dia ada topi dia kan then ah laa-laa dia ada dia punya orange orange bounce ball
you can say spongebob like who doesn't watch spongebob right like spongebob so macam macam spongebob pun unik juga pasal spongebob berkawan dengan uh dengan apa dengan starfish they call it right ya dia berkawan dengan starfish kawan dengan uh sotong
mesti sudah tentu titanic siapa
siapa yang dengar nama titanic tu mesti tahu cerita cerita pasal kapal kan cerita pasal kapal
cinta wah that was the first movie also right yang very popular at at that point of time ya ya so it interesting eh yang ini oh I got I got a question for you um if you have three wishes what would you wish for
err terutama saya suka I suka makan I suka banyak makan siapa tak suka makan kan I mean food bring joy to to everyone so food is for me
food also is something like kita boleh
kita boleh macam explore you can go like
macam try new recipe or dishes that we found like other cultures' food like it's so interesting like for me if I could get like any food I crave for I can like okay I wish for this food then it will appear in front of me it'll be great ya I mean like
uh it would be to read people's mind for me to read people's mind pasal yang
kadangkala bila kita nak tahu apa orang tu sedang fikir kan dia macam dia diam jer jadi if
I have that superpower to to know what you're thinking apa dalam minda dia macam wah
I can maybe like let's say nak buat kawan kita because I'm I'm a very shy person to be honest to new people lah if you want to make friends
so it's like if I can read people's mind like oh okay dia ni rasa macam gini-gini maybe I can from there I can start a convo maybe because I know what's going on in their mind what so
I think I mean like that's part of uh your life journey right in every journey it's not so perfect I mean dalam dunia mana ada macam mesti ada macam mesti ada macam masalah-masalah yang macam
yang kecil-kecil lah you know tapi mana ada yang macam
and like tapi apa-apa pun in the end it's all you know it's all up to you lah actually
for me it will be shopping because everyone in this world loves shopping right ya so for me shopping is fun if you get feel like masuk kedai jer ah nak beli baju ni lah ah kena bayar tak payah bayar okay
I mean just bawa balik I mean sometimes if it's see something we like
then we're like hesitant I mean biasa lah sometimes kita pun macam nak beli ke tak beli eh nanti guna ke tak tak guna eh tak guna nanti sayang pula kalau kau tak guna so
be a healing process because like you plant berkebun I mean lepas tu you tanam any pokok ah any bunga atau pokok yang yang favourite lah kan tanam then after that you water it you let it out on the sun and then you like you watch it grow it's like
tanam maybe like you can tanam fruits buah-buahan sayur-sayuran I got a neighbour ah ah my neighbour likes to plant ah
and then the starfruit was it it came in a it came in in how do I in in a oval shape at first but when you cut it inside it was actually a star shape so it was actually very ya and another I think in common common common areas also macam
ada macam tanam cili padi habis you nak cili padi daun kari daun kari for me it's very common daun kari then ada apa lagi eh macam bunga-bunga
bunga rose I don't know if it's common bunga rose ya common like ya that is like cause my neighbours they love gardening so whenever I walk past their house there'll be a lot like
tak suka masuk dapur sebenarnya masak pun nak masuk dapur tu pun macam susah sikit tapi I think when it comes to baking is a bit different for me any pastry is more to a sweeter side where cook is more to savoury savoury type of uh food what
for me that was a biggest step cause usually I will like to take the simpler step like maybe like meringue cookies macam kuih-kuih kuih-kuih tu macam bahan-bahan semua senang-senang macam kalau nak buat kek kan macam
kena bahan ini lah bahan itu lah tapi nak dia punya process the process of making it is is very hard what so for me ya my hobby will be baking how about you what what what what what would be your hobby or what would you like love to do
ah favourite lagu genre genre genre macam genre melayu ke genre ah sembarang-sembarang apa-apa genre kalau apa-apa genre
err if I were to say well we both like K pop but if genre lain would be macam
genre lagu-lagu pop lagu pop pop like lagu
oh cakap pasal lagu pop macam teringat kalau lagu ah you know pop yeh yeh it's the malays well it I always like to bring back to to the old times then like I say my friend see me as like ah throwback throwback kind of person ya lagu pop yeh yeh is
masa tu memang masa tu kita sekolah rendah eh sekolah rendah kita dah dengar lagu pop yeh yeh that was that was the band that I think that was the first I forgot what's the band's name I forgot what's the band's name but that was the first
ah malay band that I listen to at that point of time I think it's because of my sister like she also listens to this kind of like ya but ya pop yeh yeh ya it's like in dari korea tu biasa lah kan ya for me like lagu irama melayu would be the pop melayu lah they call it pop pop
live music pernah pergi dengan
band ah apa nama band tu westlife
alah boleh lupa pula ah band nama tu ah I pergi dengan my kakak kita pergi because my ni minat uh westlife sebenarnya so it was more meaningful and especially because it falls on her birthday this was back
uh it was last year ya it was last year ya basically it was last year we went for this concert ah this westlife concert it was a very that was the second time I went for concert yang live usually I tak pergi pasal I
ah satu duit kan very ah macam mahal kan tapi like this time round um my sister decided like me and the price is affordable so I was like eh you like this band why not we go also ya so was very
oh ugh my talking about shopping just now right uh fashion style I'm more to a casual side macam santai-santai tak ada anything very dramatic atau macam I suka pakai simple simple just a simple one like
pakai T-shirt seluar
err kasut tak kisah lah kasut ke sandal ah tu jer I'm I'm that type of I don't go for very like dramatic of like like ya I rarely wear accessories too but only recently
so you know me you know my collections I just decided to cause it was it was unique and cool because pasal it was handmade tak pernah nampak macam susah nak nampak ah kat luar tu orang jual macam handmade earring macam
I'm more to of a warm tone warm tone in a sense macam colour
ya I I don't go for macam colour colour macam
macam terang hijau terang terang dia macam terang you know what I mean right macam you look at wow it's so it's so bright on you like I don't wear bright colours I'm not that that kind
and warna hitam warna hitam siapa takde kan dalam global mesti ada kan so hitam is I think
hitam like is the is the main ah but for me like ya it's the warm colours how about eh ya
I think I'm on a neutral side I mean love on first sight macam macam mana nak cakap eh kita jumpa orang tu first time then kejar I'm not terus tersentuh hati terus jatuh cinta I mean I
ah faham faham ya ya ada orang pun fikir
ya for me also you will only like that person only after you get to know him like I mean maybe some people mesti tengok macam wah dia ni kacak ah dia ni macam handsome jer ah tapi tu ah fikir-fikir balik ah kita like would you really
alamak okay that that will be hard for me also because I enjoy drinking teh O ais limau dengan syrup syrup limau ya alamak if if me K if if I were to choose between syrup limau dengan teh O ice I will pilih teh O ice
I mean syrup syrup manis I mean I teh pun manis lah kan tapi teh lagi macam lagi like it give you a stronger taste like give you more depth of tasting wah
it's just mi apa noodle
kalau sound uh
actually any sound tu I takde idea tapi macam if you were to ask me if ah I tak pergi where what is ah my favourite place to go I will pick uh
gardens by the bay it's also nature it's the same I think it's particularly because I like to watch flowers bunga basically like I said lah bunga cantik like I really really really
you know my favourite ah bunga matahari bunga matahari is my kesukaan bunga matahari tu lah macam every time I tengok mesti tersenyum pasal dia
the colour dia colour macam cerah kan colour kuning kan dia macam what ah it it will lift up your mood
to to plant and to jaga macam kalau tanam tanam bunga rose tu tapi jaga bunga tu nak kena ah selalu
kasi dia air so gotta give it enough sunlight if if not it will it will not grow grow well lah from what I know rose but if I would would want to plant it's like I say
bunga matahari I nak tanam pokok bunga matahari ya
plants and looking at ah flowers bloom bunga-bunga pokok-pokok macam kalau kita bersenam di pagi-pagi dengan matahari boleh nampak eh
pokok eh bunga cantiknya
ah it will make us macam it will make
it looks quite interesting lah I think kita should pergi like
err I think ada banyak ah ada tom yum ada
macam-macam lah a lot lah I mean we can just go there and see it's quite affordable also
pun ada dia macam steamboat then macam ada tempat you can masak macam apa ni hotplate eh something they call it
hotplate pun ada macam-macam lah
and kita nak tukar to andes pun boleh
biasa lah melayu kan suka barbeque
adam maybe kalau adam nak
so macam okay so because hafizah also tengah tidur sekarang so I also don't know whether dia nak ke tak
car lite I think a bit mahal because weekend then must top up petrol some more
oh tak tahu lah maybe dia letak air kat dalam
oh belum masih dalam bag dalam bag hafizah
ya betul betul actually kita boleh makan kat ni garden you want or not
mm ada fifty percent
mm selain daripada dining in garden apa lagi ada
I mean ya kita boleh ada alternative kat sana banyak alternative
oh jom ah kita pergi sedap mania
kalau tak pergi sadap mania pergi mana
katakan adam tak ikut
boleh lah
ya I mean apa tu okay lah kalau nak kita pergi cuba so our trip can be from
you know maybe bau jer sedap mania habis tu kita nak bicycle
tengok jurassic meyer habis kita makan jinjja chicken tapi kan that time I went to jewel um
uh ahad punya malam
so um the queue ah panjang ah lepas tu tempat dia duduk kena like they put us in front of the entrance so it was very awkward lah duduk kat depan orang nak lalu-lalang lalu lintas so
I tak tahu lah apa tu um macam mana begitu but
ya like singapore memang got a lot of halal foods like
what what are the underrated punya food places ah the rating it to worth exploring today maybe
how about A&W baru halal kan
dekat jewel pun ada
kita kan nak pergi cycling
ya true also tapi tak boleh cycling
not really sure I think macam crab meat
shiitake cendawan shiitake
ya memang yummy
hari ini cheat day
K ya so macam mana
bukan B B nine eh
bukan eh
um K boleh ah
ke cakap pasal shares lah
I nak try lah baru try try I nak try stock then I macam rasa-rasanya tesla will grow lah in the future
sebab ya because a lot of countries are macam adopting err are banning petrol vehicles by
by investing in macam electric car company ini kan all those clean energy ones
the shares would probably go up lah in the future like maybe not now maybe dalam lima sepuluh tahun
macam bitcoin dulu lah bitcoin dulu also low kan but after four years then suddenly spiked up so ya I feel like for now ya maybe I'm gonna try with
I'm not really sure also but islamic finance tapi I think like macam those stocks yang
yang permissible macam you know yang tak go against the basic purpose ah macam those thoughts yang deal with um vices then
you know all those macam clearly apa ni
that's my pandangan lah on this
okay for me eh I think kita kena macam
diversify lah our portfolio you cannot keep all your eggs in one basket you have to like macam
uh wahed invest so this is a macam
only macam
syariah compliant punya stocks trading platform lah so which means you just put in your money then automatically then you select what kind of risk profile you want
commodities ah macam cash ke gold
ambil bonds and all these are like certified to be syariah compliant so I think you will feel safe
investing in macam these kind of companies
you don't have to put in effort lah you just letak your money then you just
based on my experience dia punya fees is
tapi like maybe this is one
right because I'm sure there are other than other platforms yang offer no service charge or something but then you you don't know what they are investing in
maybe you can feedback to jangan invest in bonds
macam bank bapa kita
oh like betul lah I mean yang what you say is true cuma
I mean you want apa ethical investing eh in at the end of the day that's what you want to achieve what right so I mean if you can like
those the regular accounts lah me you have no choice what tapi that's why err you have to do your own research lah if you really want to go into investing right cannot just like anyhow take
err mana-mana company I mean mana-mana banks
cakap pasal investment ni macam mana kita punya trip ni
so dia punya kentut signify more to yes ke more to no
kita err
I think she I mean she's free lah it's whether dia nak ke tak
ya maybe dia malas lah tapi anyway dia dah agree apa sunday dia okay
ya mahal sikit ah situ
ubin mana makcik punya
boleh actually boleh tapi semua orang kena okay lah
besok tak crowded
oh so kita dah dah missed lah
unless kita pergi besok
kita pergi terus pergi ubin
oh ya tak nak
any lah islands or whatever sisters' islands ke batu ke bukit
eh itu jangan cuba I I okay punya
I pakai my army boot steady
we can okay lah listen to it later lah takkan nak busuk busuk semua but I mean take the car car lite lah car lite maybe we go in the day
then we explore these like macam make sense lor
huh mahal apa
huh mahal pe
ah ni ah meadows eh
ah aniaya seh tapi tak apa lah tak rasa fizz tak apa
sekarang out of stock eh
oh you beli untuk apa makan ke jual
coconut oil dia tak jual
that time I beli I beli like tiga ke empat
untuk pakai lah untuk pakai
tapi last one expired saya tak pakai
how about those yang tinggal kat at risk blocks
boon keng eh boon keng ada ke at risk block
oh ya I heard also from my uncles because dia orang cakap dia punya kawan pun tinggal sana semua residents
ya pernah
oh I tell you just story lah ya of course lah I mean yang paling err famous is their macam a lot of drug addicts lah kat sana
err let kejap ah apa nama dia
jauh jauh jauh lah I think ah dia tinggal boon keng jauh
oh okay lah lame oh nama dia uh
nama okay lah I shouldn't cakap nama lah pasal tak baik kan kita expose orang I should just panggil dia Q lah
no lah it's one of my relatives lah dia quite kesian lah so
oh so macam ya dia dia tinggal dengan mak dia then dengan datuk dia
oh datuk dia ah
boleh lah datuk dia close juga lah tak close lah pernah jumpa lah like visit
so okay lah cuma kesian lah dia seorang kat rumah dia takde adik beradik kan then mak dia mak dia doctor actually
I'm not sure tapi I think dia general practitioner lah I don't think that specialize in anything
tapi maybe eh if I'm not wrong dia specialise in psychology
boleh lah
dia kawan doctor dia kawan police
vet tak
betul betul I think you didn't mothership ke bukan mother's gossip
ya I think betul lah I mean like kesian juga ah like people look down right all these people tapi in actual fact right you put any human being in that kind of
environment ah I'm talking about the block eh bukan the orang-orang lah block lah you put in that kind of block macam lonely kan takde family I mean takde support adik-beradik so any human being will also macam experience something will experience the same thing lah
right correct oh ya kita we are going to sentosa on nineteen december kan
you know yang the fun pass tu
tapi tapi is it legal to masuk or
or nak main luge
nak main luge
oh ya macam
but then kalau kita nak explore fort serapong
and this we go like maybe tapi panas ah takut

five minutes alah tak worth it lah mm
mm tapi tu
nak nak sea aquarium

sentosa sentosa ada bike right
or is it oh I think I know what is bipedal means dua orang boleh duduk mm tak payah lah easy bike jer lah
ah tak payah lah buang masa
oh okay tak apa
mm mahal juga
sea aquarium jauh eh
oh tak silap
ya no lah we don't go malam lah we go
see the best pagi lah
tapi I tak dapat east force rabung
force rabung tak payah pagi pun tak tahu nak masuk ke tak
oh tiga minit
mm wait sea aquarium tutup what time
kenapa you nak pergi sana
kenapa you think that it's a macam
macam fishy fishy stuff you know
it's cold and you uh tak tahan sejuk you know tak tahan sejuk
so you are you are telling me that kita kena shop before kita pergi korea
I the the thing is that I want to go there sebab I've been there
it's a place whereby I rasa macam
tempat ini bagus untuk bawa partner ah you know
I don't know kalau if there
they have mukshidonna there tapi
I'm not sure if you can apa
sebab kalau you nak shopping dekat sana
bawa benda bring light pack light lah you know
confirm berat
I wanna go there when it's winter tapi
I'm just afraid that kalau
you know lah kita tak tahan sejuk
I tak tahan but you know
I tak I I tak pernah experience snow you know so
mana balik singapore demam if kalau dekat sana dah sejuk obviously you
tak shiok
tak shiok lah siapa nak nak nak fall sick in on holiday seh
but I think you'll like it there lah sebab apa eh
but then I thought I I'm not sure that you pakai lah brand brand itu semua sebab
macam etude you know etude house
there's a lot of hand cream dengan face masks very cheap there
but banyak banyak
dekat sana lebih murah lah compared to you sini ah
we concentrate on korea dulu ah apa cakap australia
because if I want to go australia I want it to be like macam
a road trip tau you know like macam you know melbourne eh like from sydney we drive down to other places
macam we get to see the apa itu
scenery twelve apostle's yang dia orang tengok itu semua
another five years I rasa sebab nak kira-kira plan dua tahun
I dengar husband dia tengah ambil
provided provided if dia masih single lah kalau dia nak kahwin might
by then dah ada anak [kan]
like for me korea I've been there so I bring you to the places that I've been there or maybe to new places that kita yang dapat tahu
I want to try actually but then I don't think it's right lah macam tak
tak boleh ah it's not halal what it's live you cannot eat that
is expensive tapi kalau if you are there you tak buat
kira macam wasted lah you dah dekat sana you dah dah all the way sampai korea abeh you tak
not just crab ah can buy lobster or ketam what
it's it's best to just splurge ah sebab dah dekat sana apa
how to play ini huh
but then I think korea tak ada korean theme park tak ada haunted house lah
I try to find macam
kalau saturday macam pergi sentosa
I will bring you somewhere ah dekat sentosa
no lah not beach lah pakai just wear casual pakai casual jer
resort world tutup kan
check apa ini
nak kena fikir plan B juga seh
last I pergi
two thousand fourteen seh yang
sakit lah
lepas pergi sea aquarium jalan dekat vivo
then beli-beli barang yang tak perlu
I don't realise ini melissa what
is it comfy tak
but I don't like the pattern dia macam pattern wak wak pergi masjid punya kind of slipper
I I saw some of my friends pakai gini ah tapi dia macam wak wak pakai so I don't like
I support no I support the idea of you nak jual
itu mask daripada you nak beli and shortlist semua benda
kalau you buy the mask I will pay for you
tak akan you
makan is because makanan dia they are selling at thirty dollars
no that's why I say you must group the order let's say macam three for eleven dollars
mahal tau you tahu kenapa tak
kalau you tengok
you tengok services of uh delivery services eh like
so berapa
but I think for the start you just buy fifty dulu ah
macam very
macam loud loud colours macam orang might think twice ah nak beli unless it's an occasion ah macam
I nikah pakai itu apa
table dah empat
your mum dah masak
okay jangan berbual dekat sini
but ya lah I have that urge to makan mamak but then again
but adam road mana got
adam road like macam boring ah
yes ada spring leaf
but depends what what time we are going there sebab
eh that time dekat rumah orang
landed property that time we go itu apa spring leaf is it
you bring me there malam-malam lah landed property
there's this kedai apa thohirah eh
you remember tak
yang macam kedai mamak atas ah
dey you lupa eh
dekat landed property
bukan beauty world eh not the beauty world one
tak tahu ah dekat around surrounding landed property ah
dia ada satu kedai mamak terselit but it's the macam spring leaf type ah I think it's spring leaf eh is it
I tak tahu you bawa kereta you bring me I tahu
but I I ingat mahal tempat dia tempat dia mahal
level mahal eh kedai mamak mahal [eh]
landed property I tak tahu dekat mana you bring me there
sebab that one dekat SAFRA macam gitu
eh I can only remember kedai mamak
surrounded by landed property that one that that point of time when you bring me there I keluar I was lost macam eh
aside from jalan kayu yang ada kedai mamak
eight thirty tak tak sempat
dekat mana banana leaf

err if I'm not wrong suka demon slayer over it cause I don't know why but like okay lah I see I watch both demon slayer also not bad lah

ada roda mana berkayuh I don't know man my malay isn't that good my malay isn't as good as yours man
berkayuh ingat apa ferry ah uh ferry boat ah boat ah
tadi aku tadi aku pagi ah pergi beach aku dah beritahu kau kan semalam aku pergi pagi pergi beach eight aku kena bangun eh no aku bangun seven
we stopped playing at what time like three already right aku dah
I couldn't sleep as aku macam baru dalam lima lima gitu lima pagi baru boleh tidur
dan aku tidur dua jam jer ah
dan aku bangun alah I was like wah kena ke bangun
mm my family my family and uh my aunt also my aunt dia some of my cousins ah my little cousins lah
kita orang tak bawa banyak benda lah aku just cycle cycle sikit dan macam tidur dekat tent and all that ah nothing much ah actually
ya my east coast east coast park ya of course lah ada social distancing lah eh
of course lah of course lah tapi sekarang
you know uh the beach last time nearby like the beach dirty gila
dirty gila right sekarang clean oi I went there very clean sia
ya legit dude macam there's no like not much litters and everything like whoa actually very clean I don't know if like during our circuit breaker they will like
and also macam phase phase one right right after like so right after circuit breaker like ramai orang keluar kan dia orang pergi beach macam tak social distancing kan then you can see macam banyak mask at the sea cause like they just like litter and everything
ya itu pasal
oh oh kan err yang our prime minister he's gonna like say something what no meh
some people say it's gonna be like phase two B it's not gonna be phase three so so so soon kau dengar ah dekat twitter
lah just cause cause err really why did takkan sia boleh buka mask we won't be able to take out our mask too soon also
eight people ya aku dengar aku dengar not more five people cause some family some family like they have like more than five people then like they want to say like
the number of cases tak naik
kalau naik yang sekarang pun dah restrict ke apa kan macam dah tiada orang kena kan
bagus lah sia bagus ah
wah kita ada dua minit lagi whoa macam nak end podcast macam tu lah eh macam mana orang end podcast ada intro music eh
eh tak boleh gitu kau fikir apa senang sangat kerja ni
bro countdown tu apa new years new year gitu lah eh
kita orang berbulal jer like relax relax jer eh
semalam aku try main twenty then uh it's not as easy and seamless as I thought it would be sia
starting then you straightaway cam dia kasi kau options nak buat macam mana abeh nak kena buat tu nak kena buat ni so everything was macam flow after flow after flow after flow okay
semalam aku try main it's not like that sia
so ah apa tu kau dah create everything semua once kau dah start the game yet and everything and whatnot kan
apa tu positional positional training tactics kan they give you multiples multiple apa tu
tactic kau pilih sendiri
so formation apa kau nak pakai kau pilih sendiri
no that that is still lah macam they give you pre-default uh
apa style kau nak main in that game for your players to play kan
can depend lah so let's say this game kau main tiki-taka four three one
then the next game kau nak main gegenpress four two three one pun boleh
yang gegenpress tiki-taka is a style of player formation is formation so these two must interlink kalau these two tak interlink
kau nya formation tak leh work
tak boleh ah tapi kalau kau buat gitu
it also depends on kau punya team punya apa tu familiarity of the tactics ah
ada ada ah
wah itu aku belum check sia actually
but yang what I do check is there are multiple new per player roles in that sense ah so macam ah there's this one player dia punya role is a central midfielder
macam their own behaviour in the games lah how they will react in the game ah
but then most of the minor minor leagues ah macam I see I go to the austrian league ke I go to the
aku balik jer dah pukul satu pagi abeh aku main sampai pukul tiga pagi aku dah mampus
in the span of apa tak boleh jadi macam-macam sia dorang improve
dah empat tahun sia
kalau tak salah dah lima tahun siol
tu kau masih poly so bila kau masih poly kan uh
tu kau year three aku year one so that means ya it's been five years ah
it will be quite late lah I mean for now kalau kau pergi download epic games it should be free pe
aku dah cakap dengan kau dia free
aku tak check
cause aku tahu
aku nya laptop yang I buy is meant for gaming
NVIDIA ada ada
semua ada ah all settle already
but should be boleh ah cause on my old laptop yang aku nya graphic card is based on intel's graphic card tau
cannot do anything punya
highly on graphic I mean you know nya graphic macam mana kan
kau tahu dia nya muka kau nya avatar nya muka dah macam
ah then after that your players pun lari dia pun macam you you know lah the graphic is
macam mana kan so
cause most of the game comprises of their data so what's more important in this case is uh kau nak kena ada banyak data untuk kau nya computer ah kalau computer kau tak ada data then
macam tak ada space for you to put all your memory and whatnot then tu yang problem ah but
if kalau computer kau aku rasa ada memory then
macam slack sana sini in bola aku tahu but I
itu aku tak tahu ah how it will turn out lah but then
you can try at least ah maybe when you play the game then cara player dia jalan semua will be a bit
lag sana sini but on top of that
tu touch
not here not there punya type of products kan then I would see why phone will not be able to tahan by itself lah cause uh it's
it's there is too much detail in one team abeh kau tahu dulu kan kau main kan is just
okay player kau gini backroom kau happy dah sudah
settle sekarang dah tak siol
sekarang kan that player ada ada core player core group core social group social group A social group B social group C outliers
macam this type this player as a outlier play the backroom
so you have to push him into the social league ah into social group kalau tak you don't kick him out so that he will not cause distress in the backroom
habis ah backroom kau terus habis ah
they influence influence influence influence terus habis semua tak suka kau abeh kau kena buang
so that means dia dia kirakan macam the senior of the group tau
okay so then kalau kau bring in a fresh new guy let's say uh you bring another senior player from this team masuk your team eh
takde gunanya cause
kau senior kat sana tapi kau masuk tempat ni kau junior juga apa
then but before that he was from dortmund so bila dia balik dortmund straightaway dia masuk balik as a influential player
a senior in the sense tapi kalau let's say kau bawa uh young players like mbappe over to a newer club obviously he doesn't fit there pe
ah so no matter how good he is he still get outlier macam aku punya dortmund sekarang sancho is an outlier
so macam aku campak kau kat tempat lain pun kalau kau sorang melayu kat sana kau pun macam
it's like me when I was in the navy apa
cause kau tahu players kan dorang ada dia punya own friends ke apa benda ke so then they have their own players that they are closed with macam kawan gitu kan so then kalau maybe
you bring him to a new club yang uh
but then kalau kau ada player macam dia suka let's say he favours uh I will give you buckley lah
okay kau bring him to the club buckley ada then maybe from there he mix with buckley he joins the social group yang penting is they join the social group
in a sense lah cause it will affect your dressing room nya happiness ah
so kalau dressing room kau tak happy they don't go out they don't have the motivation to play
so your dressing room nya happiness actually
yes it's only free up to twenty fourth of september tak salah aku
once kau free install it's free forever it's like uh playstation Xbox membership
kau download the games for free you put you already collected the game already you put inside your library kau uninstall kau install balik pun the game is still be free
it's not your laptop nya LAN cable pe it's kau punya router nya cable pe
merepek pe
computer kau berapa lama sia ni
no Zoom lag it's not cause of kau punya itu Zoom will lag only cause of kau punya connection
laptop kau kau dah kau pernah bersihkan tak
cause kadang-kadang kalau laptop kau is dusty or whatnot right it will affect the performance
I tak I mean
susah lah sia kau nak tu it'll be damn slow ah
that game is very intensive sia data dia
aku on tiga league eh aku port aku buka empat league four players per league eh aku nya computer speed jer dia punya processor speed kan for the whole for the whole game tu kan dah four star
empat league jer tau
tak tahu ah kalau kau nak malam kau nak jumpa boleh jumpa ah malam aku tak kesah
aku balik jer terus aku boleh jumpa kau ah
abeh kau fikir aku familiar ah kirakan aku pun baru ambil download jer semalam
ya I downloaded it yesterday okay aku tak I never touch the app
aku tu dah jumpa kau pe
correct aku download aku jumpa kau after aku kita berbual semua and everything aku balik dah pukul satu pagi
aku buka tu computer aku tukar cup sana sini tukar tukar tukar aku tidur pukul tiga pagi
there is that thing lah I just found out about it today only another new feature of their tab kan yang came out
no kau maybe let's say uh okay cause kau tahu you can remove there is a filter in your first few squad pe so kau boleh remove filter ah hide injured players
merepek sia kau
technically you are apa kan bodoh
ah tu kau nak
eh kau tahu kau fikir dorang tinggal kat singapore pe
dulu kau boleh ah tak ada coronavirus you can just go around and ah beli beli beli beli abeh sekarang dah gitu semua dah balik
kau stuck lah unless they didn't go home they stay in your country ah
ah then gitu maybe uh
kau ada chance ah to play and whatnot lah but if
eh apa tu
maybe if satu hari you go lower than that baru you come out with a semi-pro club
so even if you win games your point kena deducted
until someone else macam you know what
atau they pump atau your board just okay you know what screw it I pump in a lot of assets
you relegate up cause you only have two K you relegate time tu championship which needs five K
but whether your club kat dalam ah the club kau ada loss ke ada profit ke ah there it
tak kira dah cause at the end of day
kalau player kau
ada there are there are a few clubs that did that the most recent one was this italian club I forgot what club it was
okay so dah tinggi pe kirakan serie A pe dia up there tau and then
itu lain lah itu tak kira lah bodoh
the board like they just liquidate the club so the club cease to be existed cease to be exist ah terus hilang
nari ada club esok takde club ah gitu ah
so terus takde ah then club dia hilang that's one thing so uh what
the fans did was they gather together a small sum of money each fan kasi berapa ke
that you know lah some of the fans in this club kan quite rich pe so dorang kata okay you know what aku suka club ni but then sekarang hilang sebab apa dorang takde duit okay ah aku pump duit
but ada ada yang lain ah tu really aku tak tahu ah sia kau kena kau kena
cari sendiri ah tu aku
kita ada sia actually
then you have your sunday league A sunday league B sunday league C you have all sort of leagues going on I mean I played in a few leagues myself apa so then they have been a lot of leagues where you can actually
kita mimpi jer lah tu eh
at the end of day kita semua semi-pro sia
if you're passionate about it then okay pe macam
dah gemuk cakap jer lah dah gemuk tak yah lah
so then macam
tu lah kau baru nak cakap

I'm in front of you I cannot slide aku tak boleh slide tackle kau kan so aku baring on the floor ah
aku baring jer
terus bola will hit badan aku kau will jump over me apa
aku bangun I take the ball run away ah
aku tak pernah dengar sia orang buat gini kau first time siol abeh macam
boleh boleh cause
takde time kan
ah ya lah betul lah I mean
memang gitu lah I mean apa kau nak buat kan
kerja tetap kerja apa daripada kau takde duit I mean tengok kita sekarang
no lah yang the apa tu
one thing yang we need to go and find kan is that cup lee hsien loong used
eh tu cawan bagus siol kau minum jer kau tukar kau boleh berbual ah bahasa lain sia
aku minum melayu aku minum cina aku minum ah kau
dia boleh pe
kau tak I mean the the election before the previous election kan
I would listen to melayu if I somewhat understood chim malay lah I mean kau tengok when I had to go for the interview in malay eh nanti kena berbual bahasa melayu ye
aku gabra siol
aku berbual sana sini abeh aku masukkan ini sini sana sedikit so it was a very singlish mixed malay type of thing ah so it's like how I'm talking to you now okay then oh okay sorry nak kena berbual melayu so nari buat gini gini gini abeh apa word ni eh
takpe aku keluarkan english word ah then I speak english again so it's very
it's not it's no longer our mother tongue it's always it's always english I've seen kids macam hari tu aku pergi ah aku gi pancing pe kat changi kan
aku tengok budak-budak main bila dorang main nak berbual dengan each other kan they don't talk in malay
it was a full out english fest so I was confused whether itu budak cina ke tu budak melayu cause dia berbual english kan dia nya english was
better than our parents lah in a in a sense lah cause their english was quite fluent so when I look over it's actually malay kids so aku macam
okay ni budak melayu and then budak melayu tak boleh berbual melayu
melayu is a first language english is their second language
so there's a chance bila kita dah tua
kita tak akan ingat any other language except for
but then you weren't in malaysia apa you were in singapore customs so you wasn't she wasn't in malaysia she was in singapore
for example lah kita tak tahu berbual melayu at all dia langsung tak ada melayu okay kita cuma boleh berbual english
you see back in our elders' time the language they use everyday is malay pe maybe that makcik was sebab apa tu ah dia belajar
english dengan dari tempat lain then dia forever concentrate dengan english
ah abeh kita tak tahu pe anything can happen kan
ah ye abeh lepas tu aku dah berbual gitu kau faham tak kan apa gunanya aku berbual kan betul tak
all these old people kalau you actually listen to them talk kan some of them do make sense lah I mean they can impart some life lessons but other time merepek sia dengar
ya sudah dah sudah itu itu kau jangan nak bawa balik
oh dia jiran kau okay lah tu kau boleh buat member
aku nampak pernah nampak dia jalan balik kat sini so aku tak tahu dia tinggal mana okay lah aku dah tahu ah
mana tahu dia nak buat kawan dengan kau ini budak aku macam kenal ah hari tu aku nak buat kawan dengan dia ah it can be like that pe
all I see tadi err bila aku nak naik gi rumah kau ni kan aku sesat uh
aku dah masuk lift okay so there was another couple with me in the lift so they press the twelve floor then I down there aku stuck dekat dengan nombor tu aku tengok
tingkat mana sia dia tinggal aku lupa lapan ke sebelas then in my mind
correct house eh kalau tak malu sia aku turun lagi pergi tingkat lapan
kau tahu last aku datang rumah kau bila ah
time kau tau
time kau
time kau CISCO aku tak datang rumah kau tau
ada sekali kau datang eh no there was one before after kau CISCO juga aku baru masuk so time kau datang sebab kita baru keluar makan pastu kau nak
balik rumah kau nak change out to your army uniform and everything to book in so aku teman kau aku datang rumah
then aku lepak-lepak kat living room kau
second time was cause kita nak keluar makan dengan parents aku pastu kau suruh aku datang rumah kau kejap entah buat apa that was the only two times ah
to sit down and properly lepak dalam rumah kau ni the last time I did that kita masih secondary school
most of time aku jumpa kau bukan kat rumah pe
masih ah kau
tak tahu lah
kau tahu kan the situation sekarang kan you've been unemployed longer than I have
teruk siol
singapore airlines now flights to nowhere kau tahu kan
so kapal terbang dia keluar
pusing pusing pusing pusing pusing pastu balik ah tak gi mana-mana
no just to maintain airtime and to apa tu free up ah parking space
cause kalau kapal kau kapal terbang kau tak terbang for very long
it can run down macam let's say aircon you don't use your aircon for very long aircon can spoil it's the same thing with aeroplanes ah
which is why most of their ah apa tu employees all retrenched
kau masuk if you want your things to run you have to on your generators you cannot plug in to a short supply your short supply will not be enough
kau tak leh compare
mahal that's why they
so the apa tu the postal macam okay ah aku nak buat deed good deed so ah aku nak send out
free masks to every household just for free ah aku send out to everybody everybody can be safe
and they no no no no no aku tak approve ni tak boleh masks tak work the masks doesn't work so no
and then some more there's this person they came out with a a mask a mask a proper face mask with holes inside macam fish nets
kau tahu fishing net kan ada lubang lubang tu kan so mask dia berlubang
and then kau pakai so case kau masih boleh nampak mulut nampak hidung ah tapi kau masih pakai mask
ah ye mask doesn't work but then the first
that but then doctors and nurses all have been using it for damn long cause it doesn't work ah kirakan
there see that guy macam that guy is the singapore social guy kan then she she was like
shu shu is my err my ex-colleague the one that is now working for berita harian as the
reporter actually the other day I I forgot lah that kak ain kan she just macam she just err wrote a new book right the java enigma
then after that she got the I err I was talking to her then like dia dapat the interview dengan berita harian right err
taking scraps ah from her colleagues so like quite I forgot about dia for a bit
oh ya anyway next time macam you kalau dengar like any like cool people or stories or people to interview ah just let me know ah then at least she has something to write about
okay so katakan dia is like twenty four twenty one years old twenty one years old
masih you will still consider
abang she's twenty one this year and you are twenty nine this year
katakan lah I I know someone who is twenty one years old this year and
anyway I was talking to kakak the other day she was asking whether she want to
belum but she she did tell me macam
err dia no lah dia ada make like ada make video lah like when she
um okay lah it's very big then dia ada macam err dua balconies two balconies
based on macam the video I saw it was macam dua dua balconies
I was talking to her then on the day yang err
kakak was err just mengumpat pasal dia punya
err mak mertua as per usual lah the usual err
topic of conversation between mummy kakak and the madrina
ya so then mummy was saying macam kakak is
the what's that anak mertua yang biadap I think that was the exact words err
that is a mm adjective to to describe kakak
but anyway err um remember kakak I was asking kakak when she
err celebrate hari raya in her current house
or celebrate hari raya in the next house because
eh no it should be may it should be may cause this year's hari raya was err dua puluh empat
I remember the hari raya was
dua puluh empat or dua puluh enam I think that was the
that was the official hari raya punya date
no lah as in just kakak was asking me lah macam mana cause
like kasi orang jalan jalan raya lah to her house
ya ya ya I I remember is the one yang abang yan dengan yang abang yan datang then he
yes yes is that is that one that one yang dia err minta kakak izin like err
kakak kata okay lah obviously but kakak was like cause what cause kakak couldn't say macam
no tak boleh datang kau tak boleh datang besok but like kakak was like okay
kenapa ni nak datang then I remember mum was saying macam dia tak ada barang tak ada benda lain tak buat apa
then macam why why then mum was telling the story of how he always goes to people's houses
ah ya ya I heard that he's doing it and cik anis is also doing it right was it
how old is abang yan again
suka hati eh abang just panggil orang gay eh
sangat deep
macam best sangat ke
bagus sangat ke ah ugh it doesn't happen in
there's macam everybody is more free and liberal in
for right okay I know that kalau you nak masuk kalau you nak dapatkan the hostel room right
yang the korean punya show yang dia orang taruk the the name behind the back of the chair and then you have to go and like
kejar them then after that you have to pull the pull the name off the back
like other celebrities have to chase them and cari I believe they have to pull the name tag off lah
she like it was very popular so I remember me and kakak we were saying that
but last time dia punya zaman also is you know those like
very baggy like basketball dengan football T-shirt
last time we used to have this err music teacher kat bowen ah his name was err mister jamal
like professional macam
dia punya club room he
either he's kekek like like wannabe or he really has some sort of affiliation with
one thing that's very popular is those like lakers punya basketball punya like
ya so macam the husband must be really making serious money ah
macam tak masuk akal lah like
and it's not that there's anything wrong with kerja kerja lah but
you're so macam
supply chain abang a job that is quite a big need in singapore
exactly so macam tak masuk akal lah macam
those macam how they rank the
hundred shares bonds ah you have to like buy by the thousands ah if I'm not mistaken so macam you really is bonds are basically you are funding something
but ya lah it just doesn't makes sense to me that dah dah dah belajar susah-susah then macam
I tell you this is this everything went downhill right after he met the that mamat the his boyfriend
he was quite against macam he liked to look down on a lot of this macam people because I remember last time
I asked him can we go and eat at this macam
the halal version of jack's restaurant lah there was one at
it's the steak one I remember the there's a halal one made by this chef then he had a
I believe it is or it's just err something like jack's but it's halal
then the mother is back there then he is here lah then the father remarried then I think like the father macam
dah macam macam pilih kasih a bit lah like the father
like macam it doesn't make sense lah and then you know what's the worst thing I found out from wei xiang wei xiang told me that he went there and then he still need to bring
lemon yogurt you tak you tak ingat eh
you don't macam
macam bodoh lah macam don't don't jangan lah pakai your own freaking like
so so macam I was telling like him ah that
they they don't want to macam speak out against like gay people because like
like people don't want to macam oh actually she's a liar and all these ya
a lot lah I tell you right all these macam people taking videos of like people and all these
so anyway I guess he's still got support like dee kosh is quite stupid lah in my mind macam
you're famous kau famous macam like people know people people know your face then
kau buat macam gini macam you want to proposition right don't use your own account lah
pakai macam pakai fake account lah gini pakai your own account macam you're just asking for trouble
you're just asking for macam like someone is
because macam
who didn't know what the heck he was bringing into to singapore to macam
like like so not knowing right is not a good enough macam
so same for dee kosh ah macam just because you you
doesn't like make it right lah you should own self macam
first of all right there is no budak zaman sekarang you and me right are difference by five years only
okay first of all right it's not budak-budak zaman sekarang there are people your age right
what rothschild what those other like err rockefeller and those macam
lauder the the family that still owns the that owns the Estee Lauder punya line the lauder family
all your shakes macam
so ya so macam
I'm a foodie so macam
you know what this reminds me okay no no no ingat tak mummy kan kata macam she said that
the I think wak nia right was just posting so much about her life on the like
WhatsApp group chat so mummy was saying macam sia annoying lah macam um kenapa nak buat macam gini
mm people yang yang nak attention lah yang yang yang gila gila attention so much ah that's what mum was saying macam
people yang like you know macam
huh they gila kan lelaki no macam they crazy for attention lah like they they
I I would be quite interested in like what is macam joe rogan's punya like
that he has fights to macam to announce ah like
what does he do like what is there macam preps that he have to do does he actually have to like research on
sama lah I also
because bila food
but nugget pun chicken what
if it's one lauk for the rest of my life
apa sambal goreng pengantin with ketupat or with nasi
or sambal goreng pengantin with bergedil and nasi
and sis tak akan get bored
ya but I think like the most frequent makanan yang I crave for is
sambal goreng pengantin lah
like ya because to me like sambal goreng pengantin is
sebab you will have everything there
you got paru
ada veggie ah ada sambal kacang panjang
ada chicken
hati ayam pedal eh hati ayam ke pedal eh
limpa eh
bukan eh hati ayam kan
ah so sambal goreng pengantin is like everything that I like to eat is what macam satu dish you makan dengan bergedil makan dengan nasi sedap seh
but it's considered one what tak eh
oo tak consider eh
why why macam why like that
what tapi itu lah okay lah tak apa lah sambal goreng dengan nasi pun jadi sis
pulut begitu jer
pulut tak ada rasa sis
pulut lah but you cannot put other lauk
ah tahu lah pulut
because pulut is one dish
the pulut is not a makanan it's not considered lah
because food is life tengok lah badan kita sis
bodoh bodoh
habis sis nak makan apa make up your mind
oo if kita boleh
choose like macam
a dish tak
ada sugar cane
but dia tak ada dia tak ada limited hours you boleh duduk dekat dalam kan
macam if you go yang kita pergi dekat yishun tu yang tu kan if lunch is two hours
then mainly like now buffet because of COVID the it's two hours but yang dia dinner dia up to four hours around three and a half hours lah macam tu
maybe because dia macam on the wheel sebab tu dia boleh duduk dekat situ like three hours
but sometimes I wonder what like kenapa Seoul Garden tak boleh extend dia punya duduk dekat dalam
itu lah but if like pun ramai orang masuk apa
mana Seoul Garden Seoul Garden kita duduk sebelum dua jam seh
or exactly two hours then kita gerak sebab kita dah terlalu full
so maybe next time we can try lah duduk dekat dalam
for like two hours plus and tengok kena halau ke tak
we should we should apa what's the word ah bearing up acts what's the word experiment experiment that
yang is because dia tak ada they should buat air dalam jug taruk dekat situ
macam Seoul Garden so it's easy pasal kita kalau nak tunggu dia orang the person hantar air
lambat seh
ah lepas tu nanti orang tu get irritated
macam that time pasal naan tu
the person yang get irritated
mm lepas tu dia
macam food lah unlimited food
okay let's say let's say tak ada COVID
so if sis only have to keluarkan duit makan sis have no problem with that
so yang lain so kita bayar makan jer lah like okay lah let's say makan pun alah depends ah
feeling orang kaya because it's fully paid for
sis macam nak makan korean food jom kita fly pergi korea
habis oyster kat mana yang sedap eh was it
the only the the two places that I managed to pergi was
dengan Seoul Garden
and Seoul Garden is totally macam
mm ha macam gitu
woo sis main air satu hari
kalau both of us ah dekat situ ah
kan macam gitu lah
but bora bora is more cantik
but they say yang if they want yang siapa eh they share dia punya travel experiences to see the ah si aifiqah ke mana siapa entah dia kena tidur dekat luar seh then macam imagine it's freezing
oh ya sis terlupa pasal itu ya
oh sis pun nak pergi turkey especially yang dekat hot air balloon punya tempat tu apa cappadocia wah
err dia orang boleh naik all the time you know it's not available all the time it's like terlalu windy cannot then kalau hujan cannot
macam siapa eh that time pergi dia pergi then tak straight away dapat then they have to wait like a few days after that
but they say dekat turkey it's haunted
ya turkey punya sihir eh turkey punya black magic is very very scary
bulan puasa jin is outside only syaitan is locked
so it's like that sis the logic because adik sis pun bulan puasa kena sampuk ya
ya turkish turkish people is very scary dia orang kalau buat buat sampai mati dia orang tak fikir tau dosa dosa pahala dia orang go straight punya dia orang berani mati punya orang tau
ya and dia orang punya macam and
dia orang macam I think dia punya polis eh when it comes to orang mati pasal sihir I think it's a norm thing like I think unusual death is macam benda biasa untuk dia orang
if you watch dabbe sis watch sampai terngiang-ngiang okay
like they can even like sanggup buat mak dia sendiri
yang the latest one eh ke apa
a'ah habis perempuan tu she's aware that
husband ada affair
lepas tu dia buat macam semua kena tau if you watch eh dia macam pretend that dia tak tahu apa-apa pasal dia yang buat
I don't know it's no dia buat mak dia
mmhmm ada nanti macam dia ada macam revenge macam
apa macam tadi you say about mak apa issue ah
like family issues I don't know lah lepas tu buat sampai adik dia gila and something like that lah
the anak buat lah anak dia buat mak dia dengan adik dia
kakak dia yang jahat lepas tu kakak dia nak revenge cuba you watch again
no kakak dia pergi pergi dekat ilmu sihir tu then when the person want to help her the orang yang ilmu sihir tu orang orang yang ilmu sihir tu terus mati he met the ilmu sihir tu tau
yang tukang ubat tu yang si bomoh tu tau
don't want sis tak nak being haunted again it took me a lot of time to still forget about it you know
a'ah a'ah lepas tu kan dia buat macam husband dia ke perempuan tu bunuh kan
the girl the girl yang doctor tu jahat the girl is a doctor what
so bila sis tengok cerita tu sis macam wow like so many things then bila orang tu figure out everything kan
turn turns out macam orang tu pun mati
ke orang tu
ya the tukang ubat tu pergi jumpa yang sihir konon very popular tau
the after dia ada jumpa
like macam perempuan tu jahat
dia cakap kan perempuan tu cakap aku tak suka perempuan ni aku tak suka perempuan ni
so the girl can see tapi lelaki tu macam kau merepek ah macam itu
err macam to to the guy macam he is in between believing macam dia dia as
dia percaya in the unseen as part of faith
cannot mix with science what so he's trying to do both tau to be like nak try to make a logic of that
but ya lah pasal logic and faith sometimes but to me to me personally logic and faith have to coexist together
but benda unseen ni
we cannot macam
and it's not of our faith to like rukun iman we have to believe in the unseen sebab tu
I don't know lah sis ingat nak pergi
yang macam sis dengar tadi yang cakap dekat situ is cheap yang ada buffet tu halalan toyyiban
ya ke I thought like no lah they showed example if it's eighty dollars eh let's say the amount is seventy five dollars you still it's better you pay seventy dollar then five dollar you pay cash ah dia begitu but that dia tak cakap kena breakdown in how many parts what dia cuma cakap cannot stack
cannot stack that is not macam tak boleh is not refundable
dia cuma cakap begitu jer apa so I think I can pay one ticket ah
it that time dia punya normal ticket is sixty plus sixty eight then express you tambah ten dollars jer seh
ten ke fifteen dollar so it's around eighty plus lah
but cat cat tak boleh bawa masuk dalam
ah dia ada nya turkey
but that time sis makan tempat dia punya yang dekat shrek punya tempat eh
ya sis nak try then dekat mana eh is makanan india
because sis pergi dua kali the first one is
like makan and everything sponsored
bedek seh
sis tak dapat pergi pun
one is at night time because masa tu is like a charity event
so sis dapat masuk malam it's from seven to eleven only
but tak ramai orang ah and the queue is not a lot so sis tak payah beratur panjang but imagine
but imagine pergi jurassic park punya tempat malam-malam sis for a minute there sis panic
yang dia punya ride yang air tu
habis kan dia naik kan
sis dah panic sis nya claustrophobic coming
yang dia duduk yang macam yang dekat roundabout circle kan begitu nanti dia warning then naik
dia macam begitu dah ternaik kan naik tinggi lepas tu dah dekat atas terus shoot begitu
ya I had fun too basah
that time yang yang kita nak try mummy sekali mak dia sampai pujuk the mother pujuk me untuk naik tapi mak tak takut kalau mak penakut ni mak rasa tak takut means it's not scary at all
mmhmm mak dia don't like to take ah roller coaster mak dia scared of roller coaster
a'ah mummy is always long queue then I asked the guy you know yang dekat situ is mummy ride scary
no lah to me if you ask me roller coaster tu lagi scary
then macam dekat sini cuma gelap sahaja lah begitu
but no but the tepi got the drying station what
eh halloween horror nights let's say if you pergi for the halloween horror night right so that means all the rides is still ada lah
then hantu-hantu tu
sis jerit tak
terkejut a'ah lah
sama lah without the express ticket lah
but I think halloween horror nights more people daripada biasa because people nak pergi haunted houses dia
sis nak pergi yang that time punya halloween horror nights yang ada kak pon tu
sebab dia orang cakap bila dia orang buat and the the no no he just gave birth
he wanted to ajak me then sis was thinking then sis macam should I go sebab I heard cerita that masa dia orang make the kak pon punya tempat they malam tengah malam bila nak dia orang nak tutup I think dia kena kacau what
kak pon hmm
oh dekat situ then
maybe she don't want to tell people because nanti orang tak nak datang
ya nothing will scare the shit out of me unless benda tu
a'ah and benda melayu because sis macam melayu
serious dia orang sabah also believe in benda-benda voodoo
oh orang asli is scary also you know
oh that time kan ada yang macam ah there's this exhibition right that macam museum kan exhibition dia buat yang macam you asked me nak pergi ke tak like benda-benda black magic
I don't know lah dia ada macam keris the keris tinggi lepas tu ah dia tangkap the toyol the toyol in the jar and everything ada kak pon paku kak pon
it was it was two years ago lah but where is I think it's at pasir ris the the apa
ya ya I remember it's there because ah I remember hafiz telling me that you want to go like it seems fun lah then I said like macam but it's scary sebab si
jian cheng pergi so I'm not wrong lah
macam dekat situ then ah dia punya bulu roma like betul-betul diri
because the keris is not a normal keris sebab keris tu is
dah fuse black magic
kan tiba
was it dia tengah driving ke apa no eh no no no no that was in aerostar bay eh
ha engkau tak kelakar eh brother
it's not funny sia you not funny lu lu cari pasal sama wa brother
in islam we believe right kalau kita mati our roh does not exist co-exist in this alam already so that means we are in another dimension tau so our dimension only macam co-exist time we sleep betul tak so like for example if kita mati kita nampak orang-orang people then if
is it the roh of the people or is it ghost or like jin in a form of people
jin or syaitan lah but is it
a really roh atau jin in a form of
ah manusia
apa sia
but I heard like actually burn money and burn hell notes is actually not burn rumah tu semua is actually not because of to have rumah for them and others right
it's actually to show that ah bila kita mati benda ni kita tak boleh bawa balik tak boleh bawa dengan kita or something like that
what if like life is like that ah then the miskin like got tak ada chance seh
you just imagine eh kalau kita macam the rich can buy a lot a lot a lot of special things to bribe orang dekat sana
maybe steal or maybe you kill people because people too demoralise you because you macam too depressed and you tak boleh happy tu cakap you it's like a lot story in the news that people bunuh orang atau bunuh diri sendiri because too stress and in every vision I believe in every vision atau
or maybe it's it's only islam that if if you commit suicide then it's the worse sin apa
it's one of the sin it's one of the sin lah so that's why I say macam
so even if kita kita tak ada duit pun it's part of
there's the the the the thing that we can do lah kita bunuh diri kita sendiri
kau bunuh people
okay imagine like husband and wife quarrel no money what you you ah yo hutang ni ni ni siapa nak bayar gets into the head dia stress sangat then macam
socked in the head then terus ambil lepas tu bunuh ada apa is it happens
but we don't know what like macam some people depression macam too too depressed they don't cannot find a way to to solve dia punya debts then they kill
but sis can you imagine like for us that muslim eh let's say lah even if you have a chance syurga then if you still have to stay in neraka like you never know how long you have to stay in neraka
and one other story is like macam like sometimes it it gets to me yang macam ah
they say the first thing that will be questioned in alam kubur or in the hereafter is solat like if
if kau the first question like solat kau tak pass yang benda lain semua tak matter already
then it gets to me lah then macam then some people say like some mazhab say ya you no need to pay balik yang
the solat that you missed ah solat just solat taubat then you just try not to do it again
but some people some mazhab say you have to pay back after every solat like slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly
until kita mampus then I asked I asked some people lah let's say kan macam how are we going to know how many solat that we missed
like I cannot imagine like okay lah let's say kita daripada baligh baligh umur kita sebelas tahun habis that at times kita solat juga
repay oh maybe if tak
I I wanted to I wanted to ask lah if let's say kita because we are busy in this world kan kita kejar kejar kejar kejar sometimes we don't have time to qada kan so let's say in a sense that kalau aku tak solat qada kalau aku ganti dengan solat sunat boleh
like let's say like aku because of the missed prayer kan
then sis taubat so maybe macam sis susah nak tidur malam then the only time that I can wake up is pukul tiga pagi onwards ah
so maybe that's the time that like macam can be it macam not ganti lah like can it help or not
kan sis macam takut tau let's say macam I want to be prepared macam sis want best of both world I want macam dekat dunia dengan dekat akhirat so let's say macam kita dekat dunia macam ini jer macam macam kita dekat dunia ni dah teruk macam ini macam we are already bad dah dah macam ini dah teruk begini
ya just like the story yang yang the orang yang bunuh yang the ninety nine killer or something like that or yang yang bunuh berapa orang tu then dia repent
dia repent dia mati dia masuk syurga because the person say no he didn't belum he haven't tau taubat because allah take his niat as orang tu cakap oh engkau kena pasal dia yang dia nak bunuh dia punya yang first the first pergi dekat first ustaz ni he went there lepas tu ustaz tu say oh kau tak akan diampunkan lah kau dosa kau dah bunuh banyak orang ini semua something like that lah so he out of geram he killed the ustaz
dia kill the ustaz you know
ah then he went to this another ustaz then the ustaz was saying oh ah kalau kau nak berubah if you want to be in a better place then you have to get out of your surrounding now move to another place macam tempat yang lebih baik lah so he ah kau pergi dekat sini kau belajar agama something like that
no this is another ustaz so he dengar apa yang ustaz ni cakap so he went to the other village or the other place but on the way to other place dia meninggal mati so bila dia mati tu terus masuk syurga
ya because niat dia because dia belum taubat lagi tau he tak tahu apa-apa because he just on his way to nak taubat to get out of the place then he already get to syurga so the main story is like maybe
maybe it's the niat that matters lah
tapi dah maki lah tu
ya lah tapi maki jer lah
so if you want to maki just maki jer lah kan
moral of the story is all based on out niat what so if like allah decide on where we should go
because if if we were to be judged on our sins dengan kita punya doings and everything I think nobody in this world in these deserving of jannah
tapi tak minus
dah ada stated there
I hope for that ustaz also yesterday that macam he's saying lah macam we should educate our child
that be modest penting is part of islam and all but kita pun kena ajar anak kita that you know doesn't mean that dia tak pakai tudung she is not modest enough
like we are not okay we have to teach our child like that because we have to teach our child macam what islam is all about since young and it starts from asar dia cakap
ya lah macam tak semestinya dia tak pakai tudung kau tak boleh kau tak boleh cakap oh dia tak modest dia bukan perempuan yang baik-baik it's not a good thing ah to me personally lah because pada kita agama kita kita punya amalan is all masing-masing
I think just now ah flying all my tudung then macam apa ni ten
lam soon singapore ke tadi
kurang ajar eh what
kita dah pernah kena judge lah that's why we don't we know how it is kalau people judge us
like sis pernah kena judge masa sis kerja dekat ah my previous workplace yang kat tai seng tu kan
ah I I apa after I started pakai balik tudung right
slowly lah I think after that dah dua tahun ah but it's still slow still new lah then masa tu ah I was judged by one of the co-workers lah dia macam
aku tak suka ah perempuan pakai tudung then I asked why lah then dia macam oh semua perempuan pakai tudung semua sama nampak jer baik but behind semua hisap rokok lah ambil laki orang lah I macam who are you to judge like macam just because satu orang buat kau nak judge aku macam itu
ya lah but it's not perempuan pakai tudung jer buat apa yang tak pakai tudung also buat what
so why are you judging just because we wear tudung wear tudung doesn't mean yang kita ni malaikat what
and then sis macam tak puas hati lah kena judge macam itu
step baik
kurang ajar sia
then if I judge all muslim men are or all religious men are semua pun macam tak betul how
at first sis was like sis dah jadi defensive lah because all of this is something new to me
like at first my friends semua tak nak friend with me
because macam alim begitu kan she don't wan't to friend with me sebab she say ah kau dah pakai tudung
then buat apa kau kawan dengan orang jahat macam kita nanti kita buat kau jadi jahat
then I say to her lah tak semestinya that I wear tudung aku baik seh
I wear tudung is because I wanted
change for agama lah
like sis want to change like sampai bila nak jadi macam itu maybe if I wear tudung it will remind me to to to be modest
to proper to be more proper to macam jaga diri in public
like sometimes kita dekat public kita
you know like macam dulu I never wear tudung then sis pakai baju low cut and nampak macam niat kita tak nak tunjuk tau
our intention is not macam kita tak nak tunjuk pun but nampak
so macam to me it elak fitnah
a'ah especially especially if you wear niqab
when you wear niqab right dia punya niat is to stay away from guys right to macam
stop getting attention from guys right but in these in this modern nya days if you wear niqab instead you attract more guys
you kau tak normal apa like people want to know how you look like behind those thing
hmm a lot of guys are macam itu sekarang
masa yang si nurul tu kan then yang pakai niqab dulu sebelum dia kahwin kan dia pakai niqab kan
not the ex one lah the girl that she's getting to know lah yang dah kahwin
when she wear niqab dia nampak cantik lah like you will imagine her to be a cantik girl so many girls are adding her tau
memang semua gambar dia pakai niqab she is very she is wearing niqab what so she delete all her pictures yang tak ada niqab
like nowadays that people want to know you because you wear niqab
but sis don't want to be macam tu but sometimes
ada apa you know in malaysia ada satu perempuan ni muda dia pakai niqab
dia pakai niqab and then she's very young then macam nampak mata jer kan then she berbual very lembut very lemah lembut
ah then like guys are attracted to girls like that so people like macam wah lemah lembut then muka kau cantik
then I when I was having this conversation with hafiz I was saying like you know I don't sometimes I don't I feel like I don't deserve to wear niqab lah because the purpose of wearing niqab is to grown away daripada attention what
so if like aku pakai niqab orang tengok aku then lepas tu aku berbual begitu
but sometimes we tend to forget like sometimes you know kita dekat public eh bodoh lah like that
because sometimes when we wear tudung also our cara cakap also still the same what
err pakai pakai niqab
you nak jaga macam mana nak makan then macam like sometimes when we talk to guys like
tak tak open masuk kat masuk kat bawah lah tarik ke depan sikit masukkan bawah
then macam I say macam I hear perempuan pakai niqab I hear dia orang macam giggle macam gedik like I don't like
maybe because I have unresolved issue with perempuan pakai niqab
ya because to me like I have unresolved issue macam
like neelofa ah macam neelofa
so macam so
people lagi macam have a better understanding of islam
so if kau react wrongly people macam oh orang islam macam ini lah
then I've asked myself if I were to wear niqab then I have to forsake a lot of my clothes ah like macam to change my whole wardrobe
then if I have to change my whole wardrobe then I I ask I ask I say myself like macam if I have to change my wardrobe that means all these while when I was wearing hijab I am not wearing properly
so sis jawab apa
people will judge us name like makcik-makcik
mmhmm maybe we should maybe we should start doing that lah macam neelofa you know like
she change the misconception that macam oh pakai
purdah mesti boring but if she change ah dia tak macam sparkling macam
tak macam there's bling sangat tapi macam elok jadi macam okay lah
so if you that's why they say when you pakai benda ni you are sacrificing the things that women like most
cantik lah
then remember mak saying you know like when you want to wear niqab when you want to wear purdah
because you are attracting people like if kau dah buat macam gitu that is

ya but I want back that body right but okay it's okay reda jer kan apa nak buat
kau kau happy
aku pun happy macam gitu ah
aku aku pun dah malas ah nak jaga jaga sangat
kalau jaga jaga jaga tetap lapar juga so
I may be too much by asking the people who go on holiday with me and like guys remember the schedule we supposed to go here by here jadi kalau you like told off what if sampai sini tempat dia dah tutup then like kita dah jauh perjalanan kan telah tutup so like
I would like to explore I wanna have a lot of nature in it so I ada orang suka bunuh very curious about bunuh ah and then I also like to tengok pokok
sometimes I wish singapore has like four seasons so I can like you know you you there's something new to look forward to whether you just go out you look out your window eh hari ini ada pokok this colour eh hari ini ada salji eh hari ini ada and then like tapi kadang-kadang I fikir macam like
eh then that means our wardrobe would be like so interesting ah like err summer panas so like the material lain and then winter sejuk and then we get to wear more layers so it's it's it's interesting to like dress up but then I also think about orh the money
and then also like the rumah like
um we have to have heated floors ke heated jamban atau katil ke
lepas tu kita tak nak menggigil kan bila kita tidur like ya it's it's so it's so when I think about like why singapore don't have four seasons I also think about oh so if we have four seasons it's gonna be very pretty but it's also you also have to go through all these like
so untuk saya untuk saya ya untuk for me right I want to bring them to
flower species and then can can exist all in one place habis tu tapi kalau you fikir pasal taman-taman kat luar negeri macam tadi cakap pasal ada four seasons every country not ah countries have four seasons so if you go out to see a normal tree not in a park it's a different colour
so for them that's their speciality but for us since kita takde four seasons kita boleh lah kita pergi gardens by the bay kan to look at the different flowers and also different uh month would have different themes so I think that's quite cool so that's one place I would bring them gardens by the bay to see the the very pretty flowers
family is it poor family happy family ah sorry so like when I I I when I look at it you will still have this like wow so cool and you have like the complete set and then like like err last time it was easy to get right tapi sekarang macam like
mana eh nak beli mungkin kena pergi kedai ni tapi kalau kedai ni tapi sekarang kedai semua jual benda-benda modern so macam I pun fikir lah like wah how how you get to source all of this old cards and then it's it's such a simple game also macam not so complicated and then also about games
um nanti kalau like if you bring tourists over to play games kalau kita tak berbual the same bahasa pun takpe because you know you just gitu gitu gini gini then maybe hopefully they will get it and then they will play along with us right this is like the joy of games like you don't really have to speak the same language
verbally ya not like doesn't have to be action-packed lah I also like reality uh so if it's based on true story then I can watch and then I will be like quite amazed like wow so this can happen in real life ah then like because like macam I'm quite curious lah on like
people story tapi takkan macam I nak keluar habis tanya orang eh jadi macam mana you punya life story ya I want to know more about it so I guess for me movies are one way to find out about people punya
jalan hidup without being so kaypoh about it
ya it's so like like whenever I watch this reality show especially kitchen nightmares and catfish right I always feel angry then like tengok dia orang macam like kitchen nightmare dia punya
ah chef of the restaurant then dia macam dia degil dia nak orang bantu dia dia nak gordon ramsay pun bantu dia punya restaurant kasi betul this stupid this chef of the restaurant he's like no I'm better than you no my food is
great so it makes me angry but then I still watch it and then it's the same thing with catfish it makes me angry because like how can people be so macam err
naive and like oh or tapi uh
you can lie on the internet how come these people are so macam senang nak percaya and then tapi like when I watch this also I can feel sad lah because when say if I watch catfish it's usually the same thing the people who have been catfish they just want
a friendship they want somebody to connect with and macam they cannot dapat that connection dalam real life so they have to go online ya and like what do you think about like catfishing macam have you experienced something like that or like
for me my favourite movie banyak juga lah tapi macam ada satu jadi ada satu movie ni yang I suka
macam my kat my handphone kat tepi jadi I tengah buka my computer jadi tangan tu I took out a keyboard my kepala facing my computer screen but then my eyes are darting towards like the the phone screen at the side so my body language is like trying to tell everyone okay guy
tengok I tu tengah macam ah bekerja ni eh tak ada apa-apa tapi sebenarnya mata I tu tengah tengok bollywood kat tepi tu
and like cerita bollywood how long is it usually three hours right
I think uh also the thing about watching this uh a lot of times with different people right it makes me uh find out more about err the person how they think about that movie and then sometimes like dia orang dia orang akan tengokkan ah then dia orang akan pick up different things that you didn't see
picked up in this movie so I think macam gitu it's quite cool to like tengok err with lain orang ah to see macam dia orang punya perspective tu semua ya and then like um
it was so interesting because like there's humour is there there's also like uh this muppets is it so ya and they all look so different and everybody's living so happy together like wah damn cool leh macam macam and then like
mm I pun suka tengok tengok dia orang cuma dia orang kita tak dapat tengok kat sini so it's actually dari sana lah tibanya impian saya rumah idaman saya ya so like it's thanks to sesame street that I that's how my dream house is which is actually unfortunately very expensive lah it's like
he's a good guy ya and then elmo also macam quite interesting
the soundtrack that I listen to and the actually bila I dengar soundtrack
sometimes when I watch movies also lepas saya tengok movie tu I like to go and listen to the soundtrack cause I curious right I want to know uh how the song sound like all that ya what what
honestly right I want a thousand more wishes kerana saya seorang yang tamak
ya okay so the other two wishes would be say for world peace jadi pasal err
lebih ramai lah jadi semua orang lebih baik hati menjaga hati blah blah blah and then also I want the environment to recover because we have done a lot of damage to earth right I don't want us to be sad I don't want earth to be sad ya what about you like what kind of three three wishes do you want
stuff I can just go behind the counter I can go to the cake eat or maybe if I want to try some clothes right then I can like masuk dalam and I pakai baju and I tengok cantik ke tak eh and then also maybe say if I want to go to like amusement park wow I don't have to queue eh
do wanna be invisible because macam quite
uh apa ni freeing lah ya freeing then err nobody knows
who I am I can do whatever I want so kan I can beli buat benda bodoh orang pun tak tahu siapa I kan pasal tak nampak pun ya what about you what kind of superpower you like
because like to put in perspective right this year I try to apply for uni so unfortunately the uni mahal lah satu tahun lima puluh ribu so you imagine kalau lepas tiga tahun berapa ribu tu uh
err ribu puluh ribu kali tiga it's like hundred fifty thousand where am I gonna get that money you know
yang tu caranya a lot of money so then and then uh I think so that's in my perspective personal perspective where I don't have like a lot of money and then like what if I think about other people like uh I remember uh
saudara where they had to lay antara dapat duit bursary atau budak tu move on to a better education so kalau budak tu dapat duit bursary maknanya dia kena stay in
uh not so not the best education untuk dia and then if that that budak goes on to uh a better education he might not get
uh the money so that is like so sad right why do you have to choose between money and education you know then also like because I think education macam it helps to break poverty cycles lah
ya so like the example I just gave you right people are stuck in this loop because they ah have to choose between these two and both are important right ah yang mana awak nak pilih yang duit ke untuk pelajaran ya oh ya another thing actually very important uh
ya because it's like you know sometimes when you go travelling right you go countries and then you'll be like okay kita pergi dia punya uh apa ni petrol station nak pergi toilet nak pergi toilet tak kat ah
ah petrol station dia nampak tak dia punya jamban so many different
okay so my friends and I kita selalu berbual how like we're stuck in jobs how we have to work from like nine to five habis tu bila dah habis kerja kita penat and then we don't feel like doing our own hobbies tapi kita tetap couldn't kerja because kita perlukan duit right
oh ya so like ideal vacation would be so interesting right macam people ada dia punya macam jawapan dia orang dah tahu apa dia orang nak mana nak pergi tapi tak boleh buat pasal dia orang asyik kerja like how much more longer you gonna work man like ya
that's cool my mother likes gardening also ya and gardening err she has made a lot of friends eh from gardening like sometimes when she's in the the gardening the small garden community garden right downstairs so kalau dekat sana seorang kadang-kadang ada orang lalu nanti dia tanya
eh awak sini berkebun eh then they ask her eh can I join or not like
for me my hobbies has always been arts lah I really like arts whether it's like macam music atau
makeup eye makeup lukis ke apa kan it's very fun and like uh I think about hobbies
see like uh what sort about like music right cause I'm interested in music I really like music right jadi apa you punya favourite lagu eh
apa-apa genre lah
kalau lagu melayu kan lagu melayu I ingat macam more
to bahasa indonesia I don't know why but I really like their music you won't need to recommend me more like malay stuff lah I think my bahasa indonesia is quite good so recently there's this song it's called
mengunci ikatan jadi maksud dia kan macam mengunci ikatan jadi macam memory lah dia nak simpan memory tu dia tak nak lupakan uh actually I got this song right from a drama a a drama on YouTube it's so good it's only
so ya that that's that's one of my newer favourite songs lah and it's also by an artist that I really like uh actually last year the dia ada datang singer last year maybe last year atau dua tahun lepas dia datang singapore tapi I tak tak pergi alamak
what about like live music err pernah ada pergi tak dengan experience ke tak live music
concert yang macam paling memorable tu dengan my sister juga ah ni bila dua ribu tujuh belas tengok coldplay oh actually an interesting thing about this was uh
when I went to buy the tickets for this show so I remember the people in front of me they were not fans of the show they were people who wanted to buy as many tickets as they can right jadi dia orang nak jual at
ya so that was not only the concert itself was memorable lah tapi dia punya bila part beli tiket itu pun memorable but in a sedih punya memory ya
oh ya I mm what about macam mm ni punya fashion style like how would you describe your fashion style
ya so like colours are really fun right to play and then pasal
setiap orang kan ada warna dia tetap untuk diri dia I mean like ya if you wanna like have fun go ahead you wanna be comfortable go ahead ya I got random question for you uh ya do you believe in love at first sight
apa jatuh cinta pada pemandangan yang pertama macam pelik eh
I see them do stuff after I hear them say stuff then it's like yes I like this ciri-ciri jadi I suka orang ni lah
pelik ya
when the world has so many very nice dishes you ask me to choose one dish mm how can I don't know about dish lah but I think right for I kan you know my mesti I pilih okay antara syrup limau atau teh O ais limau
ya I think uh like teh O ice also I mean you can minum panas it stays great and then you can minum sejuk it taste great
and then like but if you drink syrup limau panas-panas ada ke orang minum macam gitu tak tahu lah mungkin ada tapi I tak tahu ya and oh so um
err apa ni kat airport tu dah nak terbang tapi lapar gila belum makan my makan tengah hari pun
sikit jer I think maybe just err what do they eat japchae ah japchae I guess I'm the person who has to eat rice right to be full but I ate japchae japchae is noodle ya ya
very big ah so I if I were to reach there I calculate lah like cannot reach there before my gate open what if I reach there then the the kedai tutup then mesti lapar kan so I remember I I I only bought kacang
habis tu I only ate in taiwan
in singapore for tourist place right I like to go nature ya cause I like to relax jadi bila I nampak pokok I nampak
uh air air tenteram I tak fikir banyak I boleh dengar
I boleh tengok dia punya warna walaupun warna dia hijau jer but like there's so many different colours of green
ya like macam bunga-bunga pun
cantik very delicate
and then everybody macam just bersenam dalam dia punya taman
uh for me ah in the future future kan I uh I rasa macam my age lah like my my age right now um is fifty so that means in ten years time I'll be like sixty so sixty it is like more to finding a very uh peaceful kind of um life uh I I just want to enjoy the nature uh macam suka pergi tepi laut lah tepi laut then uh kita tengok apa pokok-pokok uh then um and having uh just a a few number of friends you know
ah you know talk about your you got kids talk about your uh your life about you punya health uh like that lah
ah betul betul betul macam kita nak apa beribadah gitu ah banyak kepada mungkin ukhrawi lah
tapi sebab tu lah nak kena ada macam apa tu orang kata uh barang-barang yang ada kena-mengena dengan sains lah okay okay okay okay okay
dia tengok time lah
martial arts ke action movie because that is really cray you know to me
uh it really like macam excite you uh you really makes you awake tau macam tak mengantuk you know at least at least eh when you watch eh your mind is not really working
uh their apa ni their actions dorang punya lawan-lawan ah martial arts jadi macam
best lah kalau dapat tengok cerita-cerita macam gitu
tapi tu tak selalu sangat lah that one's only like once in a while only but then sometimes you you
you you want to also watch uh like macam family punya kind of
ah kita nak ke mana-mana kita nak pergi apa tu katakan lah pasar ke kita nak berjalan ke mana ke bila kita ada fit body
of of course lah you have the looks you know tapi kalau your body doesn't fit
it's like when you make yourself fit then your body your look also will be like uh macam orang kata tu cerah lah ah macam glowing kan ah glowing so I mean it is
you know or maybe makeup makeup makeup dresses but they forgot about to take care of their health they forgot about uh what to eat and what not to eat you see ah jadi dorang banyak macam ah apa tu tengok lah banyak pergi mana tu uh makan fast food kan ah you see they they they forgot they forgot about the healthy foods
uh they always think yang the important is to to have a good looks you know buat expensive makeup you know and then wear ah good good clothes you know so that they will look good
younger generation need to be educate mesti kena dorang kena kena tahu lah kena banyak membaca
and then ah dorang kena tahu lah you know uh
macam mana nak apa tu ah mencegah penyakit daripada awal bukan macam like when they have already got the sickness they got disease then they will do something then they will try to exercise then they will try to
uh do the prevention then they will try to start to to eat healthy food I think no lah I think from from ya I mean daripada awal dah kena start lah macam choose makan-makanan yang terbaik itu semua
it is not really easy to say lah okay it's not easy to say because we do not know ah what are the experiences that ah you know people uh I mean orang orang orang experience
ah pengalaman orang kan cause everybody has their own experiences ada background yang berbeza
so jadi um this mental health ni
uh I mean okay lah memang makanan tu penting okay that is the most important okay the what you you eat
you know like macam they selit lots of vegetables and fruits you know and don't take too much of sugar ah that is already dah important lah you know because even then
ah secara holistic yes and then
okay but then some people say some people say that uh but I I take vegetables I take also uh I don't drink too much of like canned drinks and all that but I still got mental issue you know ah depression ke apa so I I so I rasa that um
I rasa it is how you manage lah the situation
ah how lah you manage and you did also like macam talk to people uh with with your family you don't keep to yourself
see if you have any problems let's say you youngsters eh macam like when youngsters eh kita tak boleh simpan diri sendiri lah kita kena bercakap dengan orang ah bercakap dengan family tentang masalah kita abeh pilih kawan-kawan yang very menjayai you know
ah jadi sesama lah you tak payah tak ada macam asyik nak fikir tentang masalah you kan
so kadang-kadang orang ni dia boleh accept uh the first degree of stress
yang ada ah second third degree pun masih boleh terima
ah ya depends on dorang punya capacity so I I I think like everyone they must know their limits
and and parents pun tak boleh push ah cannot push them because if they know that their kid they must know they must know and understand whether their kid because if their kid are not the kind yang
mm nak ke mana eh mungkin zaman kanak-kanak lah
mm ye lah kanak-kanak sebab zaman kanak-kanak macam tak ada stress gitu
ah zaman kanak-kanak zaman yang kita tak fikirkan apa-apa ah tak payah nak fikir kita tahu kita makan tidur main dah ah you see I mean
mm uh macam best lah kadang bila kenangkan uh waktu kecil-kecil dulu uh when my late dad was around ah how I spent my time with my dad and then uh apa tu
mm bila kita sama-sama ah apa tu spend time balik kampung you know a lot of things and as a children you don't really think so much lah about like
ah then you woke again then you you like play again you know ah you don't think so much about paying bills you don't think so much about other people punya problems like you have your own problem and you carry out your own problems you know you don't really think about other people punya problems ya macam those memories are I think are the best lah
uh there are some also children they are traumatised by their childhood memories you know that is not good for for for them lah but as for me my own experience um if I have a timer like what you say you know uh where where where do I want to go I nak pergi tu lah the my childhood life lah mm
so jadi um what you say you want to go to the the ages lah okay okay
I think peringkat umur lah eh I think uh that that that is the reason ah why like macam you you are still young you know
orang kata tu pengetahuan nak nak uh kembangkan lagi pengetahuan
uh kan nak expand kan lagi your knowledge so jadi
you rasa sebab you perlu pergi to that ages you know to nak lebih mendalami lagi uh benda-benda yang you tak pasti benda-benda yang you tak tahu mm
apa lagi eh yang kedua ketiga apa eh okay lah yang pertama dulu lah kedua ketiga macam tak tahu lagi nak fikir apa apa lagi nak cakap
oh okay maybe um wang lah ah I think oh I nak jadi seorang millionaire ah bukan sahaja healthy tapi my wish
kalau I ada duit seperti jutawan jadi seorang jutawan ke apa ah I mean not for myself but I think ah I like to help others ya help others and then I like to give I like to give to charity ah I'm a very like macam
then bila kita ada duit tu kita ada ilmu yang banyak ah kita boleh sedekah kita boleh berikan kepada dorang so I think tu yang yang can give me the most satisfaction lah itu second wish lah second wish ya first first first first wish is healthy then second wish uh seorang jutawan ah kaya raya
ah takpe lah you dulu lah what's your first wish and your second and third wish if you have
since I have uh children so of course I I don't really ask ah more like of course lah as a a parent you want to see your children ah succeed in their life you want to see your children like macam
have and will be a successful because the of course that is uh memang tak terkecuali memang you nak tengok anak you berjaya
they are arrogant you know they arrogant towards other people macam sombong gitu macam apa tu
uh tak nak dengar kata orang lain you know macam terlalu ego ke so I
err tidak ada perkara yang uh kekal dekat dunia ni so jadi uh whatever that you have whatever that cherish it lah cherish it and also share share among other people
people will like macam apa tu ah respect you lah respect you
you know ah in this life right manusia manusia ni dorang ah memang akan tengok pandang tinggi lah kepada dorang yang berduit ni semua kan
tapi kalau you berduit tapi you tak ada akhlak pun boleh pandang rendah juga
ah you see so the best thing is uh whatever it is ya buat yang baik lah kalau you ada duit pun tapi you sombong kan
ah so tak ada gunanya lah orang pun people don't look up for you people don't look into you and people don't treat you as a someone that can show a good example to generations you know and people will forget you I mean if people want to remember you yes but people remember you as a person who has who is arrogant ah you know you have a
kalau ada superpower eh kalau ada superpower I nak habiskan kerja rumah dalam satu minit
oh macam flash ah speed lah
ah macam tu macam speed gitu macam whatever that I want uh I do eh I want to do in a very fast manner
then I I I clean up the house right like macam wah habis one minute gone or two minutes wah all the house clean already semua dah bersih wah see I I I
uh I mean like then you can have apa orang kata tu relax lama-lama
ah rehat lama-lama ah but unfortunately I do not have that such power
um tapi kalau ada
you know like mac also you also using your phone don't need to you know like last time you use uh apa
ah you know senang semua but okay dulu kalau nak masak kita nak kena fikir buku pastu flip flip flip the pages ah sekarang tak payah sekarang ah sekarang ah you tengok jer youtube
ah you google jer okay nak cari resipi apa masak apa ah then you know from then on can you can already uh find the recipe that you want
main problem like contohnya I think for adults eh adults should be okay because they already know how to use the phone they know ah they know when to use it you know uh they they know like macam when not to use it you know they they they have the orang kata tu tahu bila nak focus tapi kalau children memang talking budak-budak ni you see when they are already get used to phones at an early age eh
you have TikTok and dorang dah lah macam malas sekejap macam sekejap-sekejap nak tengok TikTok sekejap-sekejap nak nak nak apa nak buat TikTok kan
ah kerja rumah semua terbengkalai then homework pun terbengkalai kan and then uh last time eh you see uh budak-budak dulu they want to watch the television they they if they want to on the television their parents will scold them eh cannot watch television ah you haven't finish your homework now they watch youtube also you do not know because the phone is with them ah you see so
ah you yourself you think how you because you yourself ask you to sleep you don't want to sleep you see you are you you you suka tengok youtube you suka tengok netflix ah lagi sekarang netflix selalu dekat phone ah you see susah kan kadang-kadang
nak nak nak stop ataupun kita nak ketepikan mm handphone tu
um pun ada good and bad dia lah maybe maybe I understand that people they are using this is to maybe cut cost
of uh you know human skills and all that but then when you think about it kan kalau were to take over humans kan then what humans going to do you know certain things boleh lah kan certain things I think um can you know take over humans tapi certain like macam profession tak boleh take over humans ah you know I think certain certain professions lah not all professions you know macam doctor you that's why boleh jadi doctor ah macam mana jadi doctor
I rasa patient tengok pun takut takut dengan dengan dengan ah you see ataupun nurses take over nurses I I don't think so lah that's why I tell you macam certain professions uh memang tak kena lah kalau I mean take over
still need uh you know human ya you still need human touch you know human skills you know and then can you imagine kalau take over abeh kita ni nak kerja apa ah you know how to earn money like that
see so kalau macam humans kan lain humans kan ah humans ada limitation ah dia macam sponge kan humans dia boleh adjust
ah you see so ye lah and and to add to that and to add to your ini kan questions you tengok macam ah apa maid pembantu rumah
ah you see you are not going to to let the to become the maid of the house right ah you know like in terms of like cleaning up maybe lah can but then in terms of you talking about eh taking after the old people don't know uh how to how to really like macam like you say lah human touch they lack of that
use use the app for for macam good purpose lah I think for cleaning up no problem because like like macam you talking about cleaning up there's not much of like macam uh I mean skills yes you must have the skills but not so much of like macam
uh thoughts to put into it you know when you do cleaning up um like macam uh you do the job cleaners and all that uh simple simple job can take over lah
uh you know but other jobs that require uh you know you need deep thoughts ataupun kemahiran ah macam kemahiran yang orang kata tu yang yang besar kan macam doctor dia punya kemahiran dia betul-betul besar kan so takkan you nak suruh take over kan mm you see
tengok lah tengok kepada keperluan pada keadaan pada keperluan pada keadaan memang when you talk about technology in years to come ah macam-macam kan technology akan datang so jadi uh we'll see lah that
mana yang lebih perlu lah at which at which sector
rather than you know like sekarang sahaja orang dah macam-macam ada banyak masalah mental problem sekarang I think kalau ada kita nak adakan lagi um orang kata untu menggantikan uh all the professions uh orang akan ada banyak lagi masalah mental health problem
mm and and and one thing and one thing pun I think um if you nak have this right untuk menggantikan the soldiers pun not bad so that you you don't use so many soldiers let's say you go to war ah kan tak ada ramai lah human beings yang mati mm
no lah why dia tak marah lah tak tak lama pun kita tunggu like just maybe I think kita sampai about
I think two fifteen then we also understand that it was raining then I also tak kasi you the address right I forgot I didn't give you the address
no I'm sorry I tak kasi you the address
eh you ada assignment is it
then suruh jer lah dia teman you lunch ah
so now he's still marah
then jumpa lah dia accompany you belajar like go to err Starbucks or something
ya I like to go Starbucks dekat buona vista you know that Starbucks
cause tadi tadi we went to do the simulator
ah the simulator is very fast I think around macam twenty minutes gitu
ya it's it's damn stupid the simulator is damn bodoh like you ugh you should go for the simulator it's so it's such a waste of time they just wanna take your money that's all
ya but I think this sekarang two B nak kena ambil simulator kan
then oh then the apa</malay>[ah] time simulator tu they there was one part uh we were riding kononnya under the influence of alcohol
ah ya so stupid so dia nya screen dia macam
ya like fuzzy but still tiba-tiba the car on the right swerve into our lane then become our fault they say oh this is what happens when you driving under err influence of alcohol you cannot predict err accident
ya ya that's why suddenly you know the car swerve into our into our lane then I got I got a macam flashback of my accident that time yang time chinese new year
orh the parents asyik suruh kita balik like oh ah kita masakkan ni kita masakkan tu then kau balik lah makan kalau kau tak nak balik then kita tak buat kan you know that kind of thing
then you will rasa like feel bad what
I macam tak nak go home for dinner
oh my god hari-hari I makan benda sama babe kat rumah like it's always ah ada telur ada ikan ada prawn and it's like that every single
simon suka apa
my mum's today because every week week then we balik sana right so sometimes dia makan sana then I balik I tak makan
like balik bishan then I tak makan then macam I feel bad lah cause
ya then simon also kadang don't eat at my parent's but most of the time he will come home and eat at my place then he will balik and then he will eat again so that's why he become fat already
ada exam soon is it
four modules ya four modules is quite heavy though considering you ada full time job and
he he tak he's not studying right he's just working kan
oh so he expects macam the same the same thing lah
oh gitu but lain what
is baru tujuh minit seh
ya I think dalam tujuh tujuh minit gitu
mmhmm tapi kita hang out kita berbual pasal you know like tu
I mean I'll okay jer kalau nak berbual pasal you know
then sekolah is like um two point five years
anything happens and then I ada sekolah or then I also nak cari kerja what
ya I already like send out resumes and stuff tapi most tak get back
I apply for macam dental assistant like reception slash dental assistant and then there's also uh patient service associate
apa lagi I apply for reception uh
because I tak nak clashed dengan simon punya if I wanted like a shift job I dah police lah like what I wanted to do right
tapi ya like so far tak get back
ya no he's is err office hour paling lambat pun maybe around seven or kadang-kadang he on course night training then he will come home late lah but it's never
macam eat into the weekends unless uh on course or he ada duty ah then those are the times when it will eat into his weekends
ya and then plus apa
like shift job tak kesah apa like ke tak ke like you still need to go and work what
oh yes yes yes yes dia ada it's like morning but it's split into two right I remember you
I very macam um quite err
pressured lah cause like kadang-kadang the kakak will ask me
ah kau tak nak cari kerja ke as in not not directly macam kau tak nak cari kerja but more like um kau nak buat apa sekarang like oh uh kau kau sekarang nak masuk sekolah like you know this kind of thing then I I've I rasa macam a bit pressured lah it's not macam I'm not looking for a job all like I enjoy being at home and not doing anything
I kalau I pergi balik pun I tak nak jadi manager anymore lah it's very it was very shitty
and then sekarang pun they already increase um part-time punya pay to I think eight
ya I know right then dorang increase I lupa lah I punya pay berapa but I think I was paid nine for a manager role
sebab I can send simon to work
and then I boleh pergi kerja dari sana because he cannot ride to work mah
ya then only during this course yang they kasi him ride his bike tapi he's he's gonna end his course soon on twenty
err tak tahu eh he cakap nak naik bus tapi naik bus is very very far for him
ya is jauh gila
ya then cakap nak boleh tak kalau kita tinggal dekat rumah your
kita kat sana kita tinggal kat hall seh babe kat tilam and then for five days you wanna
like kita ada our own macam room at bishan and then macam I I don't feel comfortable lah kalau macam everytime I'll have to like sleep in in the hall
with him then macam no privacy you know
ya then I say don't want lah like I don't mind to macam pagi-pagi you ambil I punya bike you pergi sungei gedong then after that I from there I go back my mum's place is okay lah for me I mean at least he doesn't have to like wake up so early to take the bus cause he he punya reporting time is pukul like tujuh sometime enam setengah then pukul berapa nak keluar rumah you know
sungei gedong you tahu um kubur sana
like pusaraman
ya lim chu kang but lagi dalam
ah my house is very near to his workplace tapi takkan I nak duduk sana lima hari kan
oh my god no dia takkan kasi punya girl
she won't lah dia tak kasi punya lah dia tak kasi lah my sister is damn difficult to talk to she won't even have a conversation with me about her school
ya and then uh he cakap um nak kena tunggu dia habis tour dia baru
err he will maybe pergi nee soon camp then it will be closer to his workplace already eh I mean his house tapi
ya mandai but it's lagi lama lah lagi maybe around one year one point five years
cause dorang tak kasi ride bike right abeh macam orang regular seh ya exactly the dia punya tempat kerja tu tak kasi the naik motor like everyone in dia punya
uh what do they call name battalion I guess err tak boleh naik motor you can only naik public transport atau you take your own car
ya and that's why it pressures me so much like you keep talking about having a car having a car then I belum kerja seh kita belum apply rumah belum kerja then you nak talk about having a car
a'ah I think you you you nak kena fikir about it's not just about petrol tau about like dia punya season parking berapa dia punya road tax berapa
ya that's why dia punya season parking dia punya ah apa what's that called ah road tax then your monthly instalment for your insurance it's just like ah
I don't know I tak tahu apa is going on in his head that he thinks
ya macam I find tak
makes sense lah if you nak if you nak apa ni ah restrict from uh riding bikes it's fine but he works there for five days abeh lepas tu kau tak kasi orang tu naik motor abeh lepas tu kau suruh orang tu naik bus
tak boleh because this thing is not um macam baru baru jer they say oh you cannot ride but it's been like years already it's this to this to this macam they don't want to change it lah
ya it's damn kesian ah I see
then after that dia cakap nak bangun pagi nak naik bus jauh sia babe even I nak balik rumah I'd rather take my motorbike go home to choa chu kang apa lagi dia yang nak kena pergi kerja
dah lah satu bus jer pergi sana abeh it's also together with like the
ya and bus kat that that bus nine seven five tu oh my god
they dah lah tak cater the bendy bus or the double decker bus and then it's always full you have to like miss two or three buses to to like ya
mm mm ya you're not really affected by macam
like the economy but I mean affected a bit lah it's not like you retrenched lah macam bonus dia tak dapat for mid-year bonus
ya civil servant kan tak dapat
err dia kena retrenched
with his pay and then him supporting me it's it's not so bad the only reason why it's a bit macam
macam it feels like we're we're living from pay cheque to pay cheque is because of our wedding is on hold
tapi tak tak confirmed juga apa kalau we masih hold the wedding in december cause like I don't think the government is gonna like move into phase three
oh ya ya ya tapi
hais just I I I macam nak cancel the malay wedding honestly ah tak kesah also to like ah don't have the malay wedding
no I serious I tak kesah pun not to have the malay wedding sebab
leceh sia babe like already kahwin sia like it's no point I don't see a point in having a malay wedding anymore
but I already nikah macam tak tak perlu sia
just tak perlu lah babe serious I dah nikah abeh lepas tu um
ya I tahu I cakap that you know I have a baby next year but you know you never know when you have a baby and then kalau I let's say eh around maybe uh next month or what by december perut I dah besar babe like macam mana nak naik pelamin then kalau in that case I betul-betul pregnant by the time I nak ada a majlis
I punya perut dah besar then I nak kena tunggu I beranak dulu
I dah beranak I nak kena tunggu lagi I punya confinement nak kena settle down my my child and then bila nak ada the wedding tak perlu
I nak pergi nak suruh tolong
I pergi sengkang punya
I nak pergi lah nak appeal lah suruh dorang return I punya deposit lah sebab um dorang tak kasi I punya deposit balik
oh my god I punya I punya catering did I tell you about it
I punya catering oh my god was so freaking difficult they were so difficult with me
so at that point in time boleh ada uh majlis kan
so I punya invitation is two three hundred
so uh that time government kasi sampai two hundred and fifty so you can still have a wedding and everything
ah so I cakap dengan dorang lah ah err okay I still nak go on with the wedding ah tapi invitation two hundred fifty and I tak minta balik I punya duit cause I paid for three hundred pax right so I tak minta balik the fifty that um I paid for tapi I nak you
um macam
err so I I just say that lah then dorang cakap uh they almost made me sign the contract and then say that okay boleh kita boleh err have the wedding tapi all the social distancing shit ah you settle
ya so ambil temperature semua you settle
mana boleh gitu sia babe
ya and then apa ni I paying you extra tau then after that dia cakap ah
ya dia punya contract basically saying kalau betul you punya wedding ada um COVID case ah you kena handle everything by yourself so I don't want to take liability for this at all ya and then dia cakap um
kita still akan cook three hundred pax for you
ya so basically saying I'm going to ah I'm still gonna give you what uh you paid for tapi everything else kau settle like if there's anything that happens during your wedding you are liable for it the bride and groom liable for it and they made me sign the
tak lah I tak go on ah then after that uh they I think dorang tak rugi sebab that time kan tutup
then dorang tak boleh beli their barang from there what so they have to buy it from singapore what
and then after that I cakap dengan dorang lah I give like kata putus like that I say um
kalau sampai end of the year ah I still cannot have my wedding then you return my money sebab if you think about it eh duit yang I down dengan dorang belum pakai tau
like you all tak beli barang basah
like basically you all tak tak tak pakai ah duit tu
then the the basically you didn't spend ah my money I'm just paying for the instalment nasib baik I tak pay full ah dorang
so dorang punya dorang punya
I don't know sebab I dah bayar up until the last payment so that one is the after after wedding
because the payment pasal dah nak dah nak my wedding seh masa tu
ya I bayar I think err
cause three payments only I make three payments then the last payment is like after the majlis itself lah
ya so I dah bayar dorang
photographer yang dah bayar I still ada mak andam yang dah bayar
um for malay wedding ya that's all kompang I dah bayar as in like I already deposit lah
so I think maybe if if I tak pergi and tulis I punya deposit maybe almost eight K
ya ya exactly like no service is delivered how can you say macam they suffered losses like what losses there was nothing delivered
macam I tak touch anything I tak touch anything at all then how what what losses are you talking about when you didn't deliver anything there was no services delivered I didn't get any product
abeh aqil ada plans tak like to get married before you

err interact with people he was very nice lah he was very open he say then he feels macam aqil boleh take care of you

ya tapi takkan al-fatihah pun dia tak tahu
tapi it's it's not ah macam mana nak cakap eh it's not so difficult as
I mean if aqil is uh willing to work towards that I don't think it'll be much of an issue ah like he yang willingly nak try for try to do it you know instead of err dia buat macam gini sebab your parents macam suruh or dia buat macam gini just to impress your parents I think macam this kind of thing at the end of the day I guess it will affect you
parents semua gitu what even my mum pun macam gitu what

siapa my mum
no lah entah eh she knows I have my own perangai he has his own perangai also macam when we quarrel or apa

enam tahun whoa
ada contract
jadi sudah sudah tujuh eh enam tahun
dah enam tahun wow
lagi satu tahun tengok lah macam mana
ya betul betul betul
mengidam eh
pasal pasal kita orang duduk tunggu makanan or the bunny chow tak tahu apa akan datang tiba-tiba it's a whole loaf of bread
ya ya and it was recommended ramai orang suruh order
ah cara dorang cakap dengan kita orang macam kawan gitu so kita orang saja lah tanya-tanya eh apa-apa yang sedap tak pernah try ini semua
terus err
apa nama dia pekerja dia suruh try bunny chow terus ada satu customer pun suruh kita orang try bunny chow
terus kita orang try ah ya ingat tak the customer
terus wah it it was the best decision we've ever made
ya kita nak makan banyak kira you know pros and cons kena give give in ya oof
that was quite nice ya the burger cause before that sebelum tu kita orang try ah McDonald's
then saja saja
saja nak try tengok country apa negara lain macam mana dorang punya ah McDonald's
tapi tak tak sedap sangat lah singapore punya standard terlalu tinggi saya rasa
a'ah I I boleh boleh rasa yang ini
ah ye ye ye ye ye
jadi kita orang saja tengok apa apa ni plus kita pun orang melayu terus dengar kat sana ada ada community melayu juga
uh jadi kita ingatkan
walaupun err the history is different we thought we should at least try the food
makanan mesti ada mesti ada ah sedikit ah yang sama kan
oh okay I remember ada samosa
ye ke lupa ah oh okay interesting I forgot my memory not good
dah dah dua dua tahun eh
err practise in different ways and then ya I think I think it was it was apa eh
oh oh I remembered inside it was a whole thing like inside there was fries and then there was there was daging and there was cheese it was
it was oh it was basically like roti john but they throw in uh fries also so ya and sayur also so it was like a whole meal with a
dengan ya I remember just taking one bite and felt like I just finished lunch
ya dalam lima minit tiba-tiba makanan dia dah sejuk kan
a'ah tak boleh taruk tepi pun kan
mmhmm pasal ice box<malay>dia ice box dia share nanti takut orang curi kan ya
lepas tu we also didn't want to throw I remember
oh wow tu semua pahadal dah lupa seh now all the memories are like coming back
eat like they didn't have much to eat jadi apa dorang buat is apa-apa dorang boleh dapat all the ingredients bahan-bahan dorang ambil taruk dalam roti terus makan jer
sedap but it was like a it was an experience lah it was really just all at once ya
gila weren't didn't think properly lah basically
mmhmm okay juga
kita orang tak tak bersedia at all ya
terus macam kita orang tengok atas kalau kita tengok atas tengok macam puncak dia masih tak sampai-sampai ah masih jauh lagi dalam hati ke
a'ah lepas tu oh yang yang saya masih ingat is a
on the way up ada satu orang orang ni tengah lari tengah buat morning exercise dia dia tengah bersukan lari naik turun gunung
jadi kita orang fikir eh ni ni agaknya masih masih
masih okay lah agaknya akan sampai lah siapa yang lari naik turun gunung eh
jadi kita orang ah tak jauh mesti tak jauh terus ingat dia ada anjing sekali ikut dia
saya ingat saya fikir dalam hati okay mesti dekat mesti dekat jadi continue naik ke atas continue naik
ah ada tempat duduk
ah dah naik a'ah
dua jam mak ah
ah eh tapi masa dia punya dia punya apa
ah permandangan cantik lepas tu
pun it was a it was quite cold I remember cause it was winter ya so it was
a'ah tu tu lah tu lah
but the end near the ocean was quite windy so everytime we reach the hot side we were just jalan macam biasa saja-saja lepak sikit
terus sampai ke tempat yang terlalu sejuk tu tiba-tiba ah angin dia kuat tu tiba-tiba kita orang terus lari lari lari eh
a'ah memang orang yang nak naik dorang pakai baju apa mountain gear tu semua ada yang stick panjang tu ah hiking stick dorang tengok kita macam apa pasal apa budak-budak ni kita orang saja jer jalan pakai pakai beg beg sekolah gitu
and we just rest and reflect apa kita orang buat tadi
but I really want to go back just to see signal hill see like ah tak puas cause like
cause I was really curious I actually tengok ah video signal hill macam mana terus nampak tempat dia macam permandangan semua cantik ada apa orang duduk atas atas grass semua okay like I never said I didn't regret that experience it's just I really want to go signal hill next time
I got I got jio one friend she she also malay okay we all melayu together
lepas tu we could have like walk down almost tour you know
ah gi jalan-jalan
uh uh I remember uh ada makan makanan macam fish and chips
that time kau rasa
like aku masih ingat like for for the trip was mostly the experience and I feel like the
the activities dengan kawan-kawan pasal ah I ingat dalam kita orang naik van lepas tu ada tiga van ada tiga van four is it ah ada empat van dalam satu van ada dalam tujuh atau sepuluh orang
gitu going through puberty
dengan ya kita orang dengan a few other singaporeans right I remember
ah dorang gaduh
ah kita orang walaupun ah
aku ingat ada berapa orang dalam van tak suka budak ni tapi walaupun kita tak suka kita masih baik kita orang tak tak ada dengki ke apa kita cuma
so we we sort of came to consensus that we kita orang akan bersama dalam berapa
trip tu berapa hari ye
ya one week kita orang came up with a consensus we will be together for one week so we should we should get along so even we don't like this boy we try to we try to you know make this
ya he also seem to enjoy it and I know he's aware that a lot of people don't like him lah jadi macam kesian sikit juga lah
okay lah dia minta gambar tak apa
hantar jer
okay to be fair budak tu kalau kita orang kalau kita punya kayak sebelah dia dia akan
dia akan tolak atau dia akan splash water ah lepas tu
ah I ingat that ah I have a fear of uh the sea
so that was not helpful whenever he tolak my my kayak
macam mana nak lukis just bukan lukis saja-saja tau macam lukis macam macam artist gitu
macam boleh dapat kerja like macam graphic design ah
okay pasal adik saya seorang artist jadi hari-hari saya di rumah saya boleh nampak yang
macam uh swimming
at this bridge bridge dia is a made of wood is a wooden bridge but naturally a wooden bridge can be a bit creaky
the um tahun lalu I went to krabi dengan kawan krabi okay
like I will be responsible for that jadi jadi I remember after that I
like dah dah bangun dah dua tiga jam pergi balik to the beach check up on her she still sun tanning down there
tak no it was it was it was already like
and I remember I was very fascinated by the fishes pasal dia punya air air dia clear kan
banana boat ada tu ada lah but
free do whatever and then they give us a map and they were like usually people circle here but ya do whatever you want just come back at this time and we we really just we tried to circle but but eventually I remember we went okay the thing is kita orang dua bukan orang kayak
and then I remember okay mula-mula there were like a few there were a few family members okay so we started out with a group then eventually they went a certain way and then we just split and I I didn't care lah too much about that cause we we already had a plan cause me and my friend we thought we gonna circle like and halfway through
there's certain places you can kayak right kalau kita orang nak kita orang boleh bayar lah but anyway gi kayak dekat
ah tahu tapi kawan-kawan I semua suka benda gini jadi dorang kata kat marina barrage ada kat lakeside pun padahal ada
ya I I actually uh baru belajar macam mana nak float masa kat krabi because err
I suruh ya I suruh kawan saya ah ajar macam untuk sorry lah eh vishu teach me how to swim then she tell me I teach you how to float
good enough okay jaga diri sendiri
so before we go out on the mountain trip she already told me ah nadirah jangan lupa bawa apa bawa gula-gula ke apa pasal
kalau tak nanti ah nanti penat pengsan kau dah lah selalu pengsan kau jangan
ya bawa gula bawa apa protein bar ke apa
I'm like aww tak aku tak bawa
aku terus lupa cause naturally
on the way up cause okay naik naik gunung tu dalam dua hari
dua hari kita orang kita orang naik atas lepas tu ah
kita orang ada bayar guide lah untuk bawa kita orang ke atas
lepas tu dorang ada ah ada tempat-tempat tidur
macam this small kind of chalet there was even campfire kind of thing
jadi memang dorang betul-betul betul jaga kan kita orang lah dua hari naik turun naik eh naik ada
kadang-kadang ada hujan juga pasal time tu macam june june daerah kita orang daerah southeast asia kan monsoon season kan ah ah terus ada kadang-kadang hujan pun kena stop apa semua and then I remember there were certain point where
ya then she did that but then I remember macam the whole trip she was like I told you to bring
ah dari bawah naik tapi masa kita orang
like lima belas twenty
it's like if you there you see the statue is like besar gila so the only thing that came to my head is how did they bring all these stones up
ya I don't know I just find it interesting lah but ya lah then I remember after the trip we basically we kita orang tour from the north
the city dalam satu dua hari naik bas terus pergi negeri lagi satu macam gitu and just get moving down down down all the way to ho chi minh kind of thing
no lah no me and vishu are cool okay it's just that people people who are not friends with us will find it weird cause we really like talk to one another very kasar like but we are actually damn cool with one another like we understand one another and our boundaries and whatnot and then ah after that err
ya and then I remember halfway through it was just me and her lah ya and then when it was me I know it was more chill cause like initially when there was four people I have nothing against them lah but agaknya pasal tak tak kenal jadi
naturally when I go with a group I feel like everyone should have a good experience so I always like ask oh kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa then I figure out what is the best thing to do but then there was one girl who always had a lot of issues
then everybody like cause okay firstly it wasn't supposed the whole trip bukan holiday holiday tau the whole trip was supposed to be a backpacking trip so naturally there are limitations in terms of the place we stay and you know ah like you cannot be too luxurious lah dia macam too suspicious
that kind of thing terus aku ajar naik motor cause aku boleh naik motor kan terus dia kata ah tapi ah kalau orang catch kita orang tak ada license macam mana terus aku macam
siapa nak catch kau sia
ya aku realised just okay siapa nak catch kau kalau kau rasa kau takut sangat kau naik belakang aku lah apa-apa jadi aku ada license then I was like apa sia kau takut banyak
sana punya orang punya license pun a'ah dorangnya license pun questionable kan
lepas tu macam nak try makanan makanan dia kalau macam suara dia lain sikit dia pun takut dia macam macam like some of the food were were like crocodile meat ya
like eh ah oh terus pasal dia punya kakak pernah datang vietnam jadi dia based her own experience dari situ dia kata kakak I kata macam gini gini gini tapi masalah dia kakak dia satu orang kalau dia bilang aku yang dia survey seratus orang boleh lah aku aku dengar aku dengar apa dia kata tapi kakak dia kan satu orang
dia bukan cabut dia macam okay
a'ah plan dia memang until that time jadi ah pasal ada dua budak ni satu lelaki lelaki tu chill aku dengan dia kita orang jadi good friends terus habis tu ah dia halfway through kena pergi laos
untuk internship
ah kita kena fikir
kita orang kena calculate you know kat depan tu
a'ah tu lah dorang tak payah dorang tengok dorang okay tak payah tak payah aku macam apa ni apa tengah terjadi tapi dengar jer ikut jer ya
aku ikut asalkan duit aku tak tak tak buang lepas tu ah jadi budak lelaki tu kena pergi laos untuk internship
and then lagi satu perempuan tu ah yang masalah sikit dia padahal free tapi pasal dia tahu dia tahu yang aku dengan kawan aku memang kawan mungkin dia tahu dia err visitor sorry dia pun sebelum kita orang pergi sana lah dia dah decide yang okay
since budak lelaki ni akan pergi dulu aku pun akan pergi ah jadi jadi macam gitu lah
ah tak payah lama-lama lah okay lah that was that was a good experience I made a friend and I in the trip which is the boy and then the other girl I completely cut ties afterwards ya tak payah there's no reason anyway then ya I I learnt that apparently a lot of people in that class find it difficult to get along with her lah ya
ya banyak tempat
boleh lah dalam masa depan
okay boleh
wait avengers pasal apa
captain america tak nak
what do I like oo I like comedy oh damn eh err superheroes I won't say specific superheroes like not really like a group of it so aku rasa macam group macam a bit too much gitu
macam you don't even know who to focus on right so if you have to choose then it will be spiderman but only the toby maguire version I don't really like tom holland the character
dia macam a bit awkward
um so dia
so like the way that he act macam
macam half-hearted gitu macam dia nak tak nak gitu
did you just see the the the one yang uh andrew garfield acted ya ya watch all spiderman exactly I think that's why I think it relates my life I don't know
ya aku tengok kat suntec tak tak salah
tak yang movie yang err real life action nya aku tak ingat siapa yang
sedih pe rumah kita kotak-kotak dok kau serious
apa dorang jual dekat supermarket
okay so kalau kita tukar penjara kita macam norway kau rasa boleh jalan
confirm ada banyak order in their own prison cell and and the fact that like in terms of like relapse I think like people will enjoy going prison because they know compared to singapore punya let's say err four room flat
amenities tak ada
so ya I think you really have to see dia punya apa ni culture
eh siala rabak sia
aku boleh pilih ah dia punya
macam tak biasa ah
eh sial lah aku tak belanja sia aku sedih sia cause last year last year aku macam bingit sendiri dengan sendiri tau
err aku tak ada duit kalau aku kan kerja kan eh aku tak kerja aku sekolah
so aku fikir cam simpan dalam apa dia punya basket eh shopping cart dia
benda-benda yang aku nak beli takleh afford
sedih sia
err entah macam
aku rasa aku terbawa-bawa dia punya feeling for sebelas sebelas punya sale
macam it's nothing for me um macam I don't have to worry about eleven eleven because there is black friday
because at the point of time last year black friday aku beli benda so but eleven eleven tak boleh sekali masuk kot aku rasa
kau takleh ni eh macam err collaborate
apa right right right
oh benda dia jalan
anting-anting jer kecil besar
macam stud gitu ah
sembilan puluh lapan siak ah beli kat shopee lagi berbaloi
repurpose ni kan kedai ashley lah mmhmm
eh but then if you take like macam for example if you take like the buttons from a top a blouse for example Chanel buttons how would you know it's actually authentic
belum sia eh kau tahu kan yang one thousand note dah tak boleh pakai
okay bukan tak boleh pakai it's more of like it's obsolete now um so like whatever that it's like remaining out there in the world whoever has the one thousand ya so uh laki aku cakap simpan dulu atau buat investment boleh jual kat carousell berjuta-juta dolar tak aku tipu jer so I don't know
like apa ni
err apa emas
kat cash converter eh cash converter betul lah money max situ ah ah maxi cash
kau fikir aku kena aku patut beli sekarang eh kalau sembilan dolar
ye lah
apa ni ah apa
ya simpan duit dulu ah
ya sekarang tak boleh belayar pergi mana-mana kau tahu pasal yang travel bubble
ye ke no lah I think like I mean it's more like commercial travel but um
tak normal like normal nya allergies jer
sakit ah sampai nangis semua
serious dia
laki kau kena block rabak
kirakan kau dah biasa ah
oh dia pun
tapi macam siak jer
dia gardener
damn oh kirakan dia dia kenal tu market
cam dia dia buat survey tak pernah beli
oh pandai juga eh because I have no idea who wants exotic plants I never met anyone
so dia baru start ke
apa nama dia mid-life crisis eh
mm dah lama kan I mean bukan lama sangat lah
macam a few years but
I think it's a thirty thing ah you start to reflect on your life and your parents dia bukan muda lagi
asal kau fikir gitu sia
aku rasa at this point in time
comparing to like our twenties kita tahu kita tak solat lima waktu
and we're in denial of it macam other time in the future I will change but at this point in time like now you flapping I mean that's how I feel like aku cuba ah solat subuh like susah sia nak bangun alarm clock blasting here and left left and right
aku bingit sia selalu adamnya ringtone kan it's like super loud I just take his handphone just like this is so damn annoying dia punya vibration dia just semacam tau
its more mellow so bila aku bangun macam like oh bird you know its much more
compared to bodoh punya handphone
as a wife and and someone because I I came across this Tiktok belajar eh so I came across this Tiktok with post err they were mentioning about like err
my kesalahan right kesalahan aku it's not
on my husband's punya shoulder
my my kesalahan is all just like my fault but his is his but if I do something wrong and he didn't like tegur
so like it's the same thing as wife lah so sebagai isteri kalau aku tak kejut dia untuk solat subuh part tu kesalahan aku lah
so aku macam like aku tahu kan husband aku tak bangun then aku bangun kan dia so asal kan aku kejut kan dia kalau dia solat ke tak solat
okay aku tak tahu but that's how my understanding of it lah
like time kau bertemu janji
kau fikir macam like oh ah aku nak benda ni tapi aku tak nak bilang dia aku nak benda ni
and when you have this assumption and this hope and when the thing doesn't come then kau bingit sendiri
yes I I do acknowledge what you say because that's how my husband is like kalau aku tak tunjuk dia cara-cara
ah kesayangan ke apa dia fikir macam oh aku tak sayang dia so like I have to sometimes show him make effort
well and he does the same to me lah but for me I I rather have him communicate like what he wants or what he doesn't want because I cannot just assume aku aku macam in a way macam a bit
so ya sometimes dia macam hint hint hint then aku macam like what is it that you want and dia dia macam he's the kind of person who says things this way and that way and then macam like cannot make up his mind his decision then aku macam bingit ah
oh kau kau tolong dia ah untuk hantar barang-barang
tapi lepas yang kau cakap dengan dia dia harus berbincang like perasaan semua then apa dia cakap
untuk kau kot the way that you say it
dia mat teruk okay
what's that analogy credit card emotional credit card take it as emotional credit card bila kau run away kan swipe
you you you run away now you deal with it later so nanti dia accumulate accumulate ah then one day bam oh spark fire
eh dok Tiktok aku dah obsessed tau dengan Tiktok
tapi itu tak pakai that kind of idea untuk business kau sendiri
orh itu lah inspirasi kau orh dia filter tu glove putih glove apa lagi kau nak

satu jam enam puluh minit kan betul lah maaf ye saya mengajar seni lukis okay siapa eh
months adam has been obsessed with like watching documentaries so every single night before we sleep but he finds it as an entertainment so dia tengok um macam YouTube nya video semua
abeh dia ketawa-ketawa sendiri aku bingit lah macam like sial ah sis nak tidur sia kau takmo ah abeh buka kuat-kuat pula tu bukan nak pakai earpiece
then bro ya so like err I mean it's entertaining to them because like you know trump super confident so he's like in a way find this macam like a a filler for him to before you sleeps ya so aku first macam annoyed ah but then like err it's one day one night that I actually joined him is quite funny actually cause of the trump being himself ya allah
ketawa siak

kawan ah

so but tak banyak ah cause it's
aku tak tahu aku tak ingat ni semua adam punya ya cause okay aku tahu this is not a good way to do it but because my husband is a agent so aku serahkan semua kepada dia so macam like uh my mother is a bit upset ah macam like okay mean
um everything on the table what if you know what if what if right so that would be on me lah if let's say anything happens but aku sekarang macam like nak tahu benda ni semua pasal insurance investment aku macam segan sikit so bila aku nak tahu nanti aku tanya because it's just that that's why can you stop asking

since last year tak salah okay I know this year dah memang ada
biasanya sec one sec two sec three

but is that they want to like macam lessen dia punya
camne nak cakap eh
to the free time I won't say free time macam
dia ada kerja mana ada kerja sikit it depends on how you see it
sebagai cikgu aku rasa aku suka yang lama punya because it's much more as in its more pro for teachers rather than the kids because the kids would be more stressful ada tiga major tiga exam tiga peperiksaan ada common test ada mid year ada end of the year
aku ajar art jer
aku rasa untuk budak lah menarik because like the fact that they know that this err the first three weighted assessment is not as heavy as last one so they can learn at their own pace but some students especially the sec ones
dorang macam like
rasa macam like dorang dah like gerek ah macam like eh tak payah belajar then ni ni jer buat buat quiz jer buat group work jer ah tak payah kita relax jer ah until they reach to the end eh bila macam september sept holidays eh sial lah next week ada peperiksaan sial lah aku belum belajar eh sial lah apa sia tu aku belajar dari january tadi ah so dorang panic ah so if they would have to grasp they if they have grasp the concept
of the this topic that they have learnt in err in from january onwards right then you don't have to worry you ah but kalau dorang macam like ah aku tak kesah aku boleh belajar procrastination and it won't do
online tak online dorang tak belajar langsung
siak aku bingit siak nak ajar dorang online satu ah selalu problem apa camera
cikgu tak boleh nampak ah cher cannot see you pasal aku tak on lah bodoh its like err okay teacher cannot hear you then you unmute lah ada message cher I just woke up
kau ingat apa invitation apa so macam err
um I will have to ask I don't know why macam like aku tak tahu pasal err budak-budak ni kan dorang baru bangun ke tak biasa dengan online punya attendance taking so dorang macam lemak sikit
example eh budak-budak ni nama dia azmi
dia tak dia bukan online ah dia dia dia dia tengah tidur ke apa
okay can anyone call azmi please terus senyap
um everyone can hear me right nod nod will be nice tak ada sikit ah satu dua tiga budak aku nod okay can you call azmi senyap
then aku macam sial ah apa siak
kau tahu aku kena call azmi pe sekarang then lepas tu aku type dia punya yang class monitor ya aku err tapi dorang tak respond I don't know they are scared to talk online or something to show their face oh my god so difficult aku tak tahu how ugly they look dude I seen you in school I know how you look like for goodness sake nobody cares oh my god aku nya online tau aku busy online aku pilih debate so technically its gonna be very hard the thing is we talk and we need to see each other face
to react on the on the reactions lah ada budak perempuan ni err kat rumah kan so tak payah ikat rambut ah boleh rembang kan semua aku rasa dia baru habis mandi dia main rambut dia kanan ke kiri twirl twirl twirl abeh senyum-senyum sendiri kat handphone eh sial ah aku bingit sia aku ambil video abeh aku tunjuk kawan-kawan aku
super annoying why she trying to flirt with me oh my god I I dah stress then lepas tu aku message one of the err the student in the senior aku message eh tengok kena annoying aku cakap dia suka budak err yang dekat eh dia cakap ah ada satu laki dia nak cui
dia tengah so annoying oh my god gini gini sial lah aku takleh concentrate sia
pasal some kan that point of time they were having like like err field training so the coach was lecturing tak kan aku nak excuse me sorry ah

um entah girl ah jap lagi lagi sikit jer
betul tu I fully agree I fully agree ya I pun tengok the changi airport ada banyak benda nak buat eh I heard ah dekat changi airport ada this changi village kan ada what this ah steamboat or barbecue thingy what's the name of the restaurant I can't really ingat ah
oh ya that that's amazing that's amazing okay ah I don't mind go tonight I ask adam ah whether he wants to go or not so I mean I I think adam tengah dia mengidam want to eat beef there got beef ke tak ah
ah andes andes andes kat sebelah jer kan
oh okay lah I tak tahu I I think sedap mania would be good ah some more it's like you know the barbecue smell the charcoal kind of smell you know then balik semua bau baju bau gitu someone so
so oh ah ya lah ya lah but lepas tu ya maybe after kita dah makan duduk sana and then we can go over to changi airport can cycle look at what touristic mile thingy will be quite cool quite cool ya
then apa tu siapa lagi ah might follow ah
no he had nothing I pun tak tahu lah why he so tired
ah ya lah I mean kalau kita tak jadi pergi malam ni then maybe we can think about like going maybe like the seletar cafe or something
oh ya actually kan kalau kita car lite to there will it be expensive or cheap ah
oh ya true true sinopec ya very cheap but one thing ah I pump minyak by sinopec minyak ni macam
cepat habis ah minyaknya like tak concentrated you know so I'm like what's happening here ah
a'ah lah agaknya ah letak air
ah yang your your buku you borrow you start reading already or not
I think ada punya cari eatigo eh let me tengok eatigo pun okay juga eh kita boleh rasa makanan dia like like
harga dia pun err ah berpatutan betul betul
um okay by the way I baru check eatigo ah hari ini memang ada lima puluh percent so err selain dining in the garden ada apa lagi eh
tak I will I will think changi village will be a good idea lah tapi adam tak nak pergi ah adam ya
nanti I kena pujuk lah I punya adik untuk nak pergi kedai changi village cause I pun macam nak rasa makan barbecue barbecue but somehow I pergi sana akan makan cheese tofu sahaja so
eh lapar ah
ya kejap I tanya adam adam you nak pergi ke tak
adam dia cakap dia tak nak
I pun tak tahu ah adam cakap dia nak jinjja
dekat mana eh dekat
ah jewel boleh juga kat jewel
dia boleh tengok tengok aeroplane juga dekat jewel
I rasa tak
a'ah eh dekat hub ada kan
oh betul tu
it's like how to say ah it's like macam jinjja chicken oh oh no no it's like uh wing stop wing zone that one
okay lah ya I mean actually it's it's like the chicken chicken thingy macam chicken wings so now they're having a promo they just open in hub twelve chicken pieces from twelve dollars cheap sia
it's I would say the a normal chicken is like macam you go to jinjja chicken then you order the chicken wings right that's spicy or ah it's that one lah macam gitu but this is twelve for twelve dollars
ya it it's very cheap then their flavours also it's like macam got the korean chicken flavours it's like the wing zone lah got a lot of different flavour ah like all those the chicken chicken flavour so
maybe that that's an option but I will still rather sedap mania ah sedap mania you when you went that time they charge in terms of the plate pricing right kalau colour hijau then this price kalau
kuning the other price right colour hijau do you remember because colour hijau is the cheapest mah right so what kinds of foods do they have in the ya green plates do you do you remember
oh sounds yummy ya okay apa
ah it will be nice right I went to the website just now then I saw they got a satay soup base laksa soup base I'm like wah confirm sedap ah macam gitu
baik satay sauce soup base ya ya I think it's a new flavour maybe
tapi I tengah diet
tapi takpe lah hari ini dimaafkan lah
cheat day yes betul tu cheat day
macam mana I tak tahu kejap I tanya adik I adam
adik I mata tutup ah tiba-tiba
apa B B nine
err bukan bukan bukan
ya bukan
so okay kita ada banyak masa nak berbual apa boleh kita cakap ni eh mari kita
ah nak cakap pasal orang tak
tak senonoh gitu eh
orang kasih assignment kita mengumpat
okay okay ya alright kita jadi serious um apa kita nak berbual eh um
uh kita punya keluarga or okay no lah no lah ah shares lah stock market lah eh
so um you ada any investment you you dah buat ke or anything you nak recommend
but I tak tahu because sekarang nak beli tesla mahal tak mampu though
I think kalau I I will beli the stock uh for what I have now lah my capital yang ada I would probably invest in cheaper stocks lah singapore based stocks like
uh old chang kee for example err murah jer you tahu tak old chang kee dia punya share price is err enam puluh satu sen saje tau ah serious a'ah betul tu then kalau you ada macam seratus ke dua ratus dollar then you akan
berbaloi lah then I I I mean ah I was looking at their annual report then old chang kee kan
dia orang akan open more outlets in more countries especially like in western countries where like macam the demand for asian foods are rising tapi supply tak banyak
so I would say maybe since they're are going to expand in region kan then agaknya I would think lah it's a good good good you know investment I would say some more they are like um they are singapore company so I would think
they won't grow so much but you can get money through dividend lah so I mean that's my thing lah cause sekarang I don't think I I boleh mampu lah tesla mahal saje
ya tapi itu my thing lah on stocks
tapi masalahnya some some stocks dia orang tak how to say dia orang tak syariah on client tau so nanti dia orang tak
tak boleh lah kita tak boleh ambil dia punya um benefits lah from that stocks so ya I don't know lah I tak tahu lah ni semua islamic financial ah you tahu tak anything about it
I see I see I see actually now that you say it lah that time I went for this uh website so they have this website online that they help with screen the stocks if the stocks are you get syariah pampasan or not
so it's very interesting because macam they will literally say like a tick or cross if it's uh allowed or not haram or halal lah in that sense tapi the problem with that website ah they very limited if you want to see more of like their ratings you kena bayar
then I'm like alamak then you muslim pun nak buat duit
nak tengok stocks halal ke tak
but I would say it's good lah like you know they give you like a listing and they helped you to screen up the stocks and and it's very macam you look at the platform very easy to understand so I'm like okay lah that there's very good especially sometimes because we think that the company might
ya I think bagus lah kita sekarang err I would say the muslim world is getting very progressive lah
so ya bagus bagus bagus
you rasa
you rasa
good tak stocks
ya anyway err betul tu ya but I heard kan itu kalau you nak pakai wahed invest then
ada some fees involved right like apa tu
um okay apa eh nak bilang you oh ya anyway I I found out there is days
technically grow your money but with very low return lah so macam kalau you got some money to invest but you you are still looking for investment opportunity and you don't want to put the money in the bank let let's say you got two thousand dollars then you tak nak letak it in the bank lah
because firstly kalau you want to follow the islamic banking the you know the hibah tak banyak
so if you it an alternative is I was just looking at this it's called the money market fund so it's quite good because you invest like one thousand dollars in these funds right then it will technically a new saham returns tapi tak banyak the goal of this fund is to just preserve a capital when this ends so it's like uh macam it's like a savings account with a little bit more uh
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means dia orang tak invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means dia orang tak invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
wasted lah I think like a lot of people macam lot of banks they don't really know that bonds are tak halal
ya lah wasted kalau dia orang tak invest in bonds then kita dah boleh letak duit kat dalam seh if this can be our like primary savings account you know took up the money inside here
can lah nanti I call dia orang
ya lah I call lah I call lah I bilang lah kenapa ni right
for the idea of islamic finance because technically um you are being you are being very ethical with your investing and also macam in terms of risks right you are not passing so much risk towards their consumer so
they are pushing it like especially in like the middle eastern countries so it's quite good but but unfortunately I feel like singapore macam not progressive yet in term of islamic finance
interest yielding accounts and maybe dia orang tak tahu lah it's haram because you would need to kind of know mah yang kita tak boleh yang interest and all bonds are tak halal I mean this is not like general knowledge so I think that's one thing you know education is important within the muslim community
ya kita terus deep eh berbual
ya ya ya betul betul betul I was looking at um the equivalent of bonds so called a interpreter islamic finance so I mean interesting lah because uh one good thing is our neighbour malaysia they are err they technically malaysia and indonesia they issue a lot of SOCOE so
SOCOE will be a good tapi I pun macam tak faham sangat lah how how the SOCOE um investment works but halal kan dia kan so boleh lah eh
oh kita punya trip eh ah I tak tahu lah I I punya adik kejap eh I call my adik hello
adik I baru kentut adik I kentut adik I lepas ni nak kena
I tak tahu dia punya ada like a mix of a and I don't know dia makan apa tapi bau dia like one kind you know toxic toxic
kentut ah I think maybe yes lah dia nak eating lah agaknya rasa gitu ah
ya ya itu I I I tu tak okay ha ha so anyway um
nak pergi makan I pun lapar sekarang belum makan so I pun nak pergi makan actually kan is hafizah going or not to sedap mania like what what do you think the chances are
mm mm ya lor actually semua pun dah agree apa sunday semua okay
aiyo unless kita just go somewhere to like makan lor
then after that we just lepak then because you say she want a weekend actually we can do another day where we can have everyone work together then we can cycle and all right so if you want maybe today we can just go somewhere to like lepak and makan lor
I would think maybe seletar cafe will be good tapi sana makanan dia tak halal so mana kita boleh makan oh maybe we can eat at seletar airport the mister teh tarik express dia tu mahal ke
I tak tahu what are good things for us to makan eh err
okay lah nanti I berbual dengan I punya adik lah mana kita nak pergi
but ya lah kita try lah I I pun lapar eh I I want to eat sedap mania
ah tengok ubin also
eh I didn't know tau ubin ada macam malay punya makcik jual I just recently found out I'm like what
ya lah okay tak nanti I kena banyak pujuk adik I lah
betul betul tu eh oh ya by the way just now I was looking at sedap mania punya website then uh
they have a lunch promo I think it's seven dollars or eight dollars and eighty or like macam let's say chicken set then you get your own in individual soup base then you get your own
sayur-sayuran condiments lah then you boleh like you know it's your own personalised then it's like eight dollar eighty cents tapi dia punya timing it's only from eleven thirty to two thirty so it's like actually during the lunch hours
ya ya kita dah missed confirm lah
ya besok lah I I okay juga kalau esok besok I think besok confirm tak ramai orang eh kalau pergi lunch lagi confirm kosong habis
it actually it sounds like a plan you know let me see ah besok monday I think I got nothing on
kita terus pergi ubin I boleh tapi perempuan I don't think dia orang pergi sebab besok christina I think dia kena exam so I think she cannot then hafizah dia nak ke
boleh juga kita cycle ke ubin
oh what's new ah like or rather what because december semua holidays we should like explore more places
marsiling tanya lah
car lite I think is err I think kalau the most expensive one right is err four dollars per four or six dollars per fifteen minutes
tak jadi lah gini
actually one hour eight dollar blue oh tak lah blue blue lagi mahal lah
I haus so ini air mineral water eh
eh a'ah lah kita minum air sama
oh tak lah ini kecil punya meadows
ya ya ya ya correct imagine dia orang tak
tak catch the fizz thingy then they just let people drink then they just let people drink wah
like err what's that word aniaya
eh takde lah sampai gitu
apa lagi kita boleh berbual pasal pasal entah lah
ah macam nak baca buku berbual buku tapi
tak boleh kan
biscoff itu tak boleh dah
ah ya sekarang I see biscoff dekat out of stock kat lazada out of stock
semalam I pergi cold storage ada stock so baru beli lah ya
makan lah sedap tu I buat cake pakai biscoff
coconut oil I I tak jual I beli pasal itu for rambut bagus sama rambut I sekarang macam berang kan so bagus ah bagus moisturising
alamak apa jadi
gini lah I sekarang
nak find ideas lah want to like the social mission
tapi I pun tak tahu so in singapore apa social mission you can solve
mana boon keng is it
at this block block block sebelas eh
ada yang sebelah main road tu yang you pass by satu block macam horizontal
ah block block tu I dengar dulu dulu banyak banyak dayak eh block tu ada dadah semua I heard a lot of stories you know about the block
oh distant eh jauh lah tu
nama dia Q
ya so macam mana you tahu ni Q tinggal kat boon keng
I see I see ya I mean is is it because dia tinggal kat boon keng takde bapa ke tinggal boon keng pasal takde bapa
I I curious lah macam you know this kind of at risk areas what are the demographic of the people
oh dengan datuk dia
contohnya apa khabar eh are you close with the datuk
mak dia doctor apa though
like wah so I mean not bad eh walaupun dia tinggal at risk block mak dia doctor
kencang seh then kenapa mak dia doktor mak dia pun macam tak nak take her out you know
ah psychology you pernah nampak tak dia punya dia punya mak I mean it will be very interesting you know to talk to her you know her antics and all
bagus bagus bagus very good
I actually now you speaking of which ah I think I met someone like this you know tak tahu orang sama ke this one this doctor like I'm talking about
that time I I was near the boon keng area then there was this doctor dan dia punya kucing
so I was like tapi dia tengah pakai white coat lah eh doctor dengan kucing
ah a'ah lah agaknya vet I mean we don't know lah pasal career banyak
but I mean okay lah so maknya consider good lah doctor
good lah tapi anaknya
um I tak tahu I heard anak dia
ah I don't know how I heard lah where I heard lah agaknya kat mothership anak dia macam
apa seorang ah sampai or rather act a bit pelik you know
maybe dia punya anak needs treatment lah like like do you think so
a'ah lah agaknya lah however tak tahu
ya ya ya betul tu maybe what we can do is we can actually find this um Q your distant relative we can ajak her lah go makan oh maybe sedap mania you know I heard right although they are like you know in this kind of bad situation they got a lot money in their bank account you know
duit so
lagi more reason lah takde lah takde lah
like include them into our conversation because I mean to think about it ya well what you say is true lah if someone is put in that environment they kind of macam angry or you know whatever emotion it just gets bottled up because you takde you know outlet boleh keluarkan the perasaan
so in the end you know it's gonna eat her up internally lah eh macam mana her eh I tau eat him or her up like internally
mm ah kenapa ni
um sentosa I'm not sure because if we were to go for all the attractions and all that kind of cost a lot of money then you know the bungee jump itu I tak berani
tramp punya trail then we just macam
you cannot claim compensation lah because it's at your own risk mah you masuk tempat gitu so
find out all these spaces within our own country which is good lah cause kalau kalau tak then we wouldn't have even thought about this right so only you know interesting interesting
can also then luge macam laju lah a bit too fast don't you think so
morning will be best tapi
we can go malam lah or we can go like in the evening macam cold kan begitu so macam sunset
dia tak panas sangat and ya
not pergi maghrib I mean
mm okay okay then then good lah I would think of saturday banyak orang but it should be fine lah should be fine lah
I I sekarang tengah tengok harga per the hit rock mahal juga
ya ya that that's the lowest yang ada but other one is seven rides seventy five dollars and one ride is only five minutes yo
a'ah lah laju sangat ah
wait ah let me see ah apa lagi kita boleh buat dekat sana because it's only participating attractions so uh
eh I heard dia banyak burung uh okay anyway I tengok hit rock actually ada boleh lah err
blue zone one ride is fifteen token so boleh lah mampu kalau you nak two rides from green orange or blue zone
oh okay oh okay sea aquarium pun the token so boleh mampu
boleh juga then a bit boring actually boleh lah because ten token saje apa bukan ke tiga puluh apa
tapi I tak tahu boleh combine ke tak because it's their giant swing
bukan I think is bungee jump I don't know it's just says giant swing plus skyride plus ice cream fifty five token
tapi I takut lah I don't think I I can lah
eh ni macam interesting juga eh
ya naik segway
let me see eh kayak eh takde lah
takde kayak
actually we can take cable car I I pun tak pernah naik so if you want we can take the sentosa one just three dollars mah
ya ya ya so we can do that lah so it sounds like a plan ya I think it it or if you want sentosa island bus tour ten token I mean macam lame lah
mega bounce ten ten token two mega two mega zip sixty five token kira mahal lah mega jump fifteen token
actually kalau nak boleh juga kita boleh ten token lah untuk segway
then lagi the other ten token kita naik this
eh boleh lah you jangan kita kita tak buat banyak banyak benda lah
okay lah adam adam pun nak kan pergi so I ajak my adik also everyone lah this saturday go ramai-ramai
then actually kalau nak kita boleh beli the twelve piece chicken just now I was telling you about the shake shack duck that one
ya so we can buy that one so at the same time we can bring over loaf of bread untuk makan sandwich ke apa
err let me think maybe dekat maple city ah dekat and it's halal so shake shack in a duck
ya betul tu err they have one in great world city
I am sure a bit out of the way ah um unless we can nak kalau nak kita boleh beli dekat ang mo kio hub eh
lapan ada eh eh lapan ada lah ada jer tau kalau kat north kan
a'ah geram I wah not bad eh eh but I don't know whether the promo masih ada tak kalau
twelve dollars I'm not too sure tapi worth it seh twelve dollars
uh I'm not sure about the harga biasa but I think it will be much more than that lah definitely much more than that but actual price I am not too sure actually I pun tak pernah makan I just saw this on the telegram group
so we got two more weeks actually so okay lah that's ons saturday tak boleh lah
ya lah but really looks good lah this section letak yucks okay
ada ada ada buy as you but we can buy or we can take the tram there also lah if you want
so I can just ah so can ya ya so segway I think interesting lah cause one hour dia bawa orang kita jauh-jauh semua
err they say okay so segway one hour eh I salah kot kejap eh
oh dia bukan segway dia bipedal bicycle for one hour
kalau you nak segway fun ride for five hundred meters it's fifteen token
tersalah so lah so the ten token right is for a bipedal bicycle
I I I tak tahu I I would think so
ya depan belakang kan
ya lah kalau begitu kena if you want to take the segway kan the segway eh mana ada
segway is fifteen token tapi five hundred meter saja lah half a
kalau you nak kita boleh pergi ifly
tapi dia punya token hundred and ten
eh okay token dia sixty token kalau you want one skydive
okay lah I mean okay so I think kita kalau nak we can go mega adventure park we can do one mega bound
macam tu lah would be best if we can like have a lot of like different different kind lah activities
ten token for one ride so kalau you nak we can do err one which is like five minutes confirm tak cukup tapi okay lah one one of ride and the other one is err the mega bounce mega zip so ten plus ten
you know that's one way lah we can if you want kita pun boleh pergi sea aquarium also ten token and it's it's a tour open ocean discovery tour sea aquarium
tak eh sedap seh I've been to aspirasi
ya or maybe we can go there makan first at seah im the aspirasi then after that we head into sentosa lah because kan nak naik the monorail also it's free what
tapi nak pergi pukul berapa tu kalau saturday malam sangat nanti kena macam rush
I okay tapi it won't happen one pagi
susah um okay lah we put it about three o'clock kita jumpa
ya three two two or three eh what do you mean force rabung maghrib pe
I think adam pernah pergi force rabung and he he say that is okay leh but he went in the day
ya that's why maybe tonight kalau jumpa then he can tell you more about it lah
kalau jumpa lah ya
so ya lagi tiga minit
eh okay lah so next saturday nineteen kita pergi lah what whatever time lah because I think kalau nak morning is gonna be difficult like habis not possible
two o'clock would be a very macam practical time two to three o'clock
um let me see sea aquarium tutup pukul five
pukul lima on saturday also five but we have a tour so I think if I don't know must follow the tour or own time own target so
aku tak tahu lah
macam chicken lepas itu nugget

veggie got tempeh
ya lah but it's up to you nak letak apa dekat dalam what

everytime time puasa
she will go back to the husband punya village then sekali
nanti time sahur
dia cakap there dekat tempat village tu banyak rumah kosong pasal kena sihir
a'ah kan and dia orang punya sihir is like sihir sampai mati punya
then ah nanti time sahur jer nanti dia cakap you will hear she will hear a lot of things macam budak nangis lah perempuan nangis lah kan then I was like thinking
bulan puasa seh
mm so moral of the story is don't marry a turkish man gitu eh
tak ah tak sangat ah
ah serious yang mana
ada ke seh anak buat mak gila
itu dabbe lah
ya it's not the mak buat
no mak dia kahwin kira dia dua ni mak dia dua ni dia orang bukan adik-beradik tau dia orang adik tiri
ya that but they don't know that dia orang adik tiri
ah it's not that the girl yang buat it's not the kakak yang buat tau
is it not the mak yang buat dulu ke
no mak dia yang buat dulu then terus dia punya hantu dengan jin tu pergi dekat kakak dia
yang dia nya yang dia nya best friend ada affair dengan dia punya husband kan
husband dia bunuh perempuan tu because of one gambar a'ah
but husband dia padan muka lah ya
siapa suruh cheat cheat on the best friend pula tu
she seek another doctor nya help tu kan dengan tukang ubat
but then kan kau ingat yang dia pergi yang dia punya yang dia pergi dekat tempat tukang ubat tu ke yang tempat doktor tu then ada satu budak perempuan tu yang boleh nampak-nampak barang kan dia cakap yang mulut dia kena paku kena begitu like what she did to herself
ya lah because they think macam why would a
jahat person come to seek for help
ya lah ya lah
ya lah but it's already written in the quran yang kau yang there's another world ya
eh tadi aku nak tanya apa eh
oh nanti dapat dia punya hundred dollars nya tu then they cannot stack the
pasal it's not like hundred dollars dia orang just hundred dollars again tau like it's break it's break it's broken into like maybe twenty dollars aku rasa
they say macam ada satu tempat tu yang dia punya fish and chips ke burger dia sedap
bedek eh
mak dia penakut ah
I don't know I've never ride the mummy before masa tu aku rasa
was either long queue atau tengah
then that time aku naik yang jurassic park kan basah kan after that kau tahu aku pergi mana yang tea cup nya
because I dekat tepi-tepi kadang-kadang ada dekat tepi-tepi there was this one yang dekat tempat tak ingat lah dekat tempat mana but it was it disguised itself himself herself as christmas tree habis aku kan
habis aku kan
buat christmas tree kan dulu
so aku pergi dekat aku macam aku nak pegang-pegang sekali tiba-tiba benda tu move tu aku terkejut
tak sis mak kau
because it managed to macam scare aku ah tu aku macam
ya he was laughing pasal macam aku kan susah nak takutkan a'ah then tiba-tiba dia macam macam itu
sixty something sama lah aku rasa
but one of the scariest is aku punya kawan ya tak pun yang the kak pon clan and she also looked like kak pon ah that one
my friend I said my friend is one of the scariest she also looked like kak pon
a'ah she is one of the ni lah kira kak pon punya scarers lah but she never entah lah dia tak cakap apa-apa pun
kan I wanted to go seh because aku rasa
yang hari tu aku pergi pun the the year before aku pergi the only thing that scared me was the
sabah dia orang macam buat sabah punya voodoo shit begitu
ya lah
dia no dia macam ah aborigine punya ni ah orang that apa tu
what is that called orang asli orang asli
it's not really macam scary
aku suka eh benda begini
sikit hari aku macam aku tengok yang puaka tu kan and then they were like saying yang sis huzairi ni ada cerita pasal kawan dia nak cerita cerita-cerita hantu ni semua then suddenly dia punya kawan just kept quiet and then just say like I will tell you next time macam
lain hari ah then ah then they were like macam apa seh engkau tiba-tiba ah then sekali I think he texted or cakap ah the next time err or like call or something aku pun tak ingat
mmhmm dia dekat situ then dia cakap ah eh dia balik ah then after that ah baru dia cakap ah tadi kita tengah cerita-cerita pasal tu banyak orang kan
habis ah then they say lah macam kadang-kadang kalau kita cerita-cerita benda begini macam benda macam it's like inviting the the thing then I'm like
there's no such thing as ghosts what there's only jin
I don't know ah because like macam hari tu aku tengok yang incredible tales tu kan they say their ah kong is there because they never burn the house
you know like chinese believe that they need to burn things like hell notes then a'ah for the departed then they just macam dia orang tak burn the house for him so he cannot he got nowhere to go because dekat tempat dia tak ada rumah so he went back to the house
okay but I got this one question for you habis kalau if you are poor what even can you do
it's not the worst sin lah but they believe that macam
ya lah but kalau kau bunuh diri sendiri pun it's not it's not a
you want to bunuh people with what seh I don't know you have don't have anything what
ya but at the point of time it's not kira dia macam you are not of sound mind tau at the point of time
ya but then that's the only kira macam that's the only sin lah kan
betul lah that's the only sin that's the only sin that you have
tak juga no I mean like islam is fair because macam dia orang akan
akan timbang kau punya buruk dengan baik engkau and then after that if you have your buruk and then you will just go through all that you will be punished for all your buruk but then after that you will be given a chance to
taubat lah that's why got
I asked this question during umrah
ya lah then that's why I say that's why that time I was in umrah then they they was talking about this lah like ah before we went to umrah we have like the course kan habis dia orang tanya lah macam okay then bila kita zaman ah this ustaz macam rock rock sikit lah habis dia cakap then bila kita zaman time zaman rock kita pun terlepas solat then dia cakap kita buat apa yang kita mampu then kita solat taubat lah solat taubat then whatever that you can do like if you have extra time then you just pay back macam qada because you know you don't know how many
how would I know siapa kita nak judge that's why say at the end of the day you can only hear say all all of these kind of thing
but okay then there is the thing about orang yang kafir tapi dapat syurga just because dia kasi air dekat anjing tu so that's why I said like who are we to judge who are we to pertikaikan kita punya amalan
kalau aku pun aku bunuh sia aku nak taubat kau cakap macam itu kau kurang ajar apa
but he already bunuh the ustaz
ya lah that's why kan aku cakap nawaitu tu penting nawaitu tu penting sis kan aku dah cakap tadi tadi pagi tu jatuh niat nak maki ah tapi dah maki lah tu jangan nak macam nak cakap benda word this word is for another word but actually kau nak maki tu dah jatuh niat dah dah jatuh niat nak maki tu
mm maki jer
that's why macam kalau kau macam niat kau nak solat pun tu kita dah dah dah dah plus point dah malaikat dah tulis dah oh dia nak solat ah dia terus nak pergi tak oh tak dia tak pergi tapi tak minus tapi dah dah jatuh niatnya ya then if kau nak buat jahat pun dia tak ada nak tulis macam nak oh nak buat jahat tak tulis sampai lah orang tu pergi dekat tempat tu and dia buat jahat then baru dia orang tulis
it makes it macam susah untuk orang nak terima islam because
like orang pergi masuk dalam masjid tak pakai tudung kau orang tengok atas bawah apa salahnya sister sister nak sembahyang pun sister nak solat kita buat jer yang wajib
doesn't mean like you don't wear your tudung your amalan is lesser than
yang spaghetti bolognese punya hook tu aku cakap apa tu yang
lepas tu aku rasa macam orang orang-orang ni semua I don't know how they educate their children and all
I mean I'm not saying that aku ni ah aku ni perfect but like I have ground rules of not judging people lah
oh sis lagi kena teruk everytime I wear tudung then people all like macam cakap aku ni macam-macam
it's not about step good good ah dia macam macam ah alah perempuan tudung ni semua you know the guys that I like get to know right they say macam perempuan tudung ni
actually senang jer
macam kira senang dapat ah
it doesn't matter lah I think it doesn't matter like what people think of us if it's just apa kita
like I think those kind of things so so macam
mengghairahkan and
siapa nurul
the cantik one
she what her display picture ah yang tunjuk muka dia pakai niqab
no I mean like macam you know we want to be we want to try to be influencers so why not like
tak ah sis more aware ah
but how to makan ah with niqab so you just open like that then makan I mean like ya ya lah
ya but then macam that's how people see you as a hijabi ah so when kau macam jatuhkan judgement dekat niqabi when orang jatuhkan judgement as
dekat kau as a hijabi then kau macam tak boleh terima
but actually macam betul lah cuma pada aku macam kalau kau nak pakai niqab kau punya niat bukan untuk just to cover yourself but I think you need to have
ilmu lah kenapa kau nak pakai niqab so engkau punya journey
so macam kau punya journey tak tersekat-sekat macam bila kita nak pakai tudung pun kita kena tahu
dia macam there's an opening there's an opportunity there is it time for me to change and wear
tapi macam okay speaking of this eh I was like thinking tau masa tu macam orang-orang yang pakai niqab ni semua semua macam very ah small sized you noticed or not they are very small sized and dia orang punya tulang is very small so like
not say macam fat fat you know but it's like I'm already born big ya big build but then macam bila aku pakai eh aku rasa macam then I was saying this to nek yam you know then I was like macam eh habis nanti orang pakai habis macam
you know all these people macam pakai macam terletak jer then macam for me is like terletak and then tiba-tiba macam shoulder besar
and shoulder besar and then like then macam tergantung ah macam tergantung kita macam hanger so it's like it's not nice ah pada aku then after that nek yam said something that macam terus macam aku terus ugh
macam then she say you wear things you want to wear a niqab you want to wear to impress people or you want to wear because of allah
sis terus shut up lah
ya lah but doesn't mean kau presentable it
it doesn't have to do with yourself it just macam kau tak boleh change diri engkau
dapat sis looking at her
at myself like you know like I said to you at that time macam she became a basic
but then macam but when you wear all these things you need to be slightly ringarde lah
in dunia lah mmhmm
tapi macam kalau kau dah actually kau pakai hijab jer kau dah kena sacrifice all these things seh slowly lah

azrul selalu keluar I remember
ya dia fresh pass pun eh aku nampak ada P plate kat kereta dia

is that macam punya
kawan kak yin siapa sia
nadia punya is that one meh
apa racer
oh very dia lah very dengan kind macam gini eh
yes dia pun macam macam rumi juga a bit lah
it's just the pelik for me
I don't know ah dia macam
I think dia dah gonna get
engaged eh ke kahwin tak tahu lah cause dia I don't know aku selalu nampak dia on Instagram dengan this one indo girl
in the video I think I got hear before dia berbual indo macam indo punya kind
so that time dia dengan dorothy together
and then dia punya Instagram is still dia dengan perempuan tu
I don't know eh but dorothy punya Instagram is different dorothy dengan dia
so I don't know ah apa
what kind of three way ke apa binatang it's called is going on with them it's just damn weird pelik also
then that time yang aku pergi tengok thai punya performance kat monti
then kita invite rumi also lah cause rumi cakap dia nak tengok like um drag performance those nya kind
and then banyak-banyak then
tertiba dia macam tak ada girlfriend
dia dia cakap dia single cause
know thai punya friends those gay friends keep asking ah like apa tu oh ah where's your girlfriend and stuff no girlfriend you single or what dorang macam nak menggatal kan then macam like
oh no lah I'm single and some more dia tengah in ke apa
but then dia punya Instagram masih ada the indo girl tu
and then just damn pelik ah sia and he host around with anything that moves
aku pun tak tahu aku just don't know lah
but I know zul tak comfortable dengan rumi also
zul pun petty nak mampus kau tahu dia cakap like I don't want to talk to rumi cause he never wish me happy birthday
macam apa kau merepek eh
ya apparently then aku macam
girl kalau aku lupa nak wish kau macam mana eh how ah and was like I probably won't talk to you ah
I tak faham
aku just tak faham I think
justin also quite petty when it comes to birthday dia macam like dia cakap birthday is important what it's once a year what so hard
then aku cakap like if you're not
ah aku tak faham ah
but zul know I know zul um tak comfortable cause of tu ah
um rumi I think rumi macam menggatal dengan dia also
unfortunately for his case lah but I think that time zul was with dylan dengan mata air dia ah
ya and then dia cakap like rumi eh rumi uncomfortable and then macam
kalau I know we are all closed kita very touchy also cause we hug a lot ni semua then
dia cakap rumi rumi does that ah but rumi macam
it's kau
macam gitu jer ah
but rumi I've always seen as that way cause first time aku jumpa dia pun macam gitu
kita semua minum pe together at sticky fingers
but I like to see dia punya Instagram cause dia selalu pergi merayap makan and he eats good food
kat tempat the weirdest place
ya and dia ada motor I think
I think dia ada motor vespa
vespa dia macam ada shield macam that big ass shield kat depan
dia very gitu lah macam indie macam dia nak stand out from the rest
dia macam dia kind of mainstream but dia tak nak show yang dia mainstream so he gets something that is
macam kawan kau ni ah also macam motor tak banyak but actually people want that kind of bike
ya dia macam gitu jer
maybe ah the dorang just what one year apart kan
dorang sama batch pe so ya
cause dorang cousin
ya hor then that one yang mana muka dorang pun tak sama sangat
case dorang pakai baju
senonoh gitu ah quite presentable
but aku just stress ah
aku just stress tengok dorang
I think dorang tu lah
I think rumi ambil
culinary but I don't know if it's ke tak I think he went to SHATEC or some
cooking school cause aku nampak dia selalu masak jer
uh I don't think rumi take aku dulu ingat dia gemuk dia pernah tunjuk gambar dia
dia tunjuk gambar dia grow up ah that that night at sticky fingers ah dia macam like eh you all want to see or not I last time look like what gemuk gila gemuk gila macam bola sia muka dia
I think masih ada kat dia nya Instagram dia post
probably eh cannot be dia baru enlist baru juga enlist
kau tahu yang dia kambing boy kan
kau tahu advertisement yang kambing
no like I think Suria ada this advertisement where
anak kambing saya and then dorang pergi macam this farm abeh ada advertisement kambing lari-lari rumi was
rumi was that boy in the in the kambing video that's why when aku jumpa dia kan at times like eh
kau macam familiar then tahir first time aku dah tahu dulu cause dia cakap dia in that kambing video and then when I brought tahir out to meet justin zul rumi semua and then macam like
and then keep keep keep guessing then thought he really is the kambing boy but dia tak pernah post ah
tak pernah post at all kau tengok gemuk weh
then dulu dia masih gemuk sikit
he doesn't like pout or whatever shit oh dia ambil gambar nanti boleh nampak macam kalau aku nak ambil selfie atau aku ambil group photo nanti tiba-tiba macam like dia adjust adjust dulu angle dia baru dia stare through camera gitu
oh there kawan-kawan dia
I don't know many picture ambil budak whampoa ah sia
if I'm not wrong dia bukan melayu
but dia berbual melayu ah I think
dia ada malay blood but I don't think it's like full
it's smaller and smaller lagi-lagi kalau kau masuk kan tertiba semua orang kau kenal
macam aku ah aku before aku satu orang pun tak kenal sia aku cuma tahu aku punya secondary school friends and friends
then masuk you will be like eh kau kenal ni kau kenal tu oh aku dari dulu sekolah tu
kau masuk aku rasa kau will meet

so yang kau meet also is those like long route punya sekolah
lagi lama lah sia
poly itself is already three years kalau kau remote remote
no choice I think last boleh ambil kau twenty six twenty seven
twenty aku masuk twenty fourteen twenty fourteen
twenty fourteen atau twenty thirteen ya
then ada satu budak ni from nineteen ninety

girl aku that time tak ada choice
aku two weeks jer aku dapat surat tu aku dah kena masuk kena campak ah sia
aku nya applications for private schools jer dah rejected say oh we cannot accept you cause your letter is too soon and then cannot cannot apa tu reject aku nya school applications cause
it doesn't makes sense but aku aku tak faham but aku masuk anyway
if aku defer I have a feeling I would go into army
for sure cause abang aku not in recruit anymore what
that time I wanted to lah I die want to cause aku nak main combat combat nak main tembak-tembak semua cause
tak ada orang dapat main tembak apa unless you're in police lah but police punya
weapons weaponry and shit is different is more to apa tu defence atau macam whatever protection lah
duit aku sia
is it the one kat tempat yang yang
dekat dengan some centre thingy where all secondary school last time kena pergi kan
itu yang indoor kan
ya but yang outdoor pun ada pe budak-budak pergi
last time is the same venue just that ada macam this tempat lapang ni
padang or some some plain field lah I don't know I not I not
we'll see lah we'll see kalau kau masuk army ke tak okay
petition for apa eh
of course lah dia nak standardise dia nya family
no cause that time I did remember I had a talk with your mum kat tempat the car wash kat then macam like
oh baba lele is then macam aku and then pop is police then aku macam like okay what kalau adik masuk at least dia belajar real life skills kalau tak masuk paramedic pun at least ada firefighter cause ada dua jer pe yang
hot spot nya vocation then macam like tak nak ah mama nak dia masuk army that's it
sister aku dah macam gitu macam okay but ya lah I mean
for sure kau better off in
army lah cause kau dulu pe
aku rasa mama kau die die tak nak kau masuk police lah or just cause dia nak dia cakap dia nak dia punya son go through the
ah boys punya experience
ah brotherhood dia dia cakap yang oh tak ada brotherhood
macam what where my sisterhood
ada tu ada lah tapi macam you know nanti korang dah pergi station terus kau pecah like go scattered elsewhere
but ya kau masuk army sua
kau have one job okay kau jangan disappoint your mum
technically budak-budak sekarang dorang cakap ada choice pe apa benda before enlistment you can apa tu fill up the options and stuff then they will look through cause dorang cakap banyak orang depression cakap yang dorang kena campak to different organisation and then dorang suffer
instead of going through the proper life skill punya shit
especially banyak orang complain sia aku tak faham aku that day pergi balik to my academy aku tengok
barang-barang kau semua dah siap sia atas katil
it's not like macam dorang bagi kau an empty bag then like my time I
bag bag besar tu then kena pergi two different store rooms cause aku kecil gila so aku kena cari aku punya size know campak kena ambil dorang dorang campak helmet
helmet dorang campak bottle dorang campak jer eh macam like
macam kau tahu aku tak tahu aku rasa dorang were paid to be that much of a an asshole
so dorang macam kat table dorang kan dorang macam like S size S size then budak-budak store dia macam like keluar kan barang abeh macam like campak campak kat pile lah so that pile is all S size another pile is so
kalau aku nak aku ambil from that pile yang dorang campak campak tu ah so aku just ambil jer

apa tu apa dia cakap fall in eh
fall in kat tempat kita punya coy apa benda tu and then kita alpha so alpha tingkat dua jer tak payah nak naik like five six storeys but alpha alpha and bravo
um kita nya bunk is
single bed is not like double deck so I think charlie and delta delta paling worst ah obese kan so delta is the last floor plus dorang bunk bed ya so the entire macam kau tahu the spiral stairs
it's not an open stairs dia macam ada window ah but tutup so kadang-kadang bila dorang dah habis training dorang nak naik kan nanti dia punya tingkap all like foggy
cause dorang punya body sweat and heat kan naik atas and especially dorang kena sampai tingkat enam ke lima girl aku tengok dorang you know bau lah cause they have cause we have to share the stairs ada tiga so
so pandai pandai korang lah scatter kan but I don't know why dorang suka naik kat tangga where it's always alpha yang kena pakai alpha pakai cause alpha tingkat dua jer and then dorang naik itu
but anyway bila aku nampak aku kan nak tidur kan dorang macam kena brief debrief eh kau punya before kau boleh tidur kau kena drink up drink up aku is like
ya I think the bottle besar lah sia

so aku manage to drink half then aku tak boleh minum then aku
dorang tak boleh cheat what cause nanti at the end of the tu siapa dah habis kena gitu

kau nak jerit kat orang buat apa eh
ya but why jerit during when can jerit everyday and not be in that also
dorang tu um scout me for
apa tu saint john
tak nak medical kan

cause it's the biggest uh macam parade kan
cause I remember D&T block like really kecil and then in between the classes
no the centre one banyak pokok the the gardening the science block one is slightly bigger the space
situ jer korang merayau kat sana
but ya I I mean is the foot drill kan macam side side foot drill nya competition macam korang buat foot drill cause of footwork so korang buat the or whatever shit it is called is for precision
ee ada what what uniformed group ada eh
I know primary school ada scout
oh join kat luar
buang masa jer
east side tak ada eh
west coast ada cause that time I remember ada this budak book in
kau masih budak how can you
eighteen and I hold like like corporal how are you lieutenant then I realised aku zoom kan it's not civil defence
it's and then they go around macam
I think macam tu ah hannah nya ex siapa tu nama nya
siapa nama dia khai eh
ya and then dia dia nya mum
text hannah cakap like takmo jumpa anak dia selalu
tak cukup ke jumpa kat sekolah kau imagine kalau mak dia dah cakap gitu dekat faiz faiz would
kan terus ten K pun buang
merlin merlin semua camelot semua ada
wait but the one yang faiz bilang kan is the same night yang kita keluar
um cause when faiz bilang kan
oh wait my mum did say something about like faiz got something to tell the family I macam apa benda
how his mum gonna fork out ten K I mean you have to understand faiz is an only child habis tu dia nya parents also
work humbly lah like kerja enough for dia punya own small family he's not a richie boy a richie solo kid
and all his earnings are to his family and his his own allowances dia tak minta pun ibu dia duit that's for sure I know lah
so kalau dia minta a'ah minta aku two hundred
aku dah order apa dia cakap dia dah order tak ada duit nak bayar then aku macam
aku tak faham sia dia eh buat aku stress sia
lapar lah sia
kau imagine kalau aku abang aku dengan faiz are all girls mak aku minta ah confirm dorang tak nak kan bayar kan bodoh
oh ya yang tempat park avenue tu
not the melayu
I malay melayu
ah sia aku bagi dia eight eight jer lah
abang kau bagi fatin how much
but quite sepet mata dia weird eh was it dengan kau
ah dengan kau lah
kan aku keluar lift then aku cakap eh ni nak salam ke tak eh
then mak aku cakap itu kan bapa pengantin that's the one kan
oh ya ya he got the sepet eyes
damn kau ada kau ada new member
tiger dah accept
bodoh lah
apa sia tak ada duit nyayi
aku tak save pe duit
no I mean like there's a difference what between kau nya savings for your own self savings for
mm but he's holding the entire family punya
every month atau year annually got money lah store in so can take out once cause dia nak let go let go of all so that we all have our individual punya insurances investments and shit so he keep forcing me to be more independent so aku macam like apa ni I am still seventeen at heart but cannot lah
ya ya I think dia bilang
but we met what that time yang kat airport all all her sisters were there except for the youngest one
ya the yang kecil tak ada cause that time me and tahir didn't know that the youngest sister existed ya and then when dia tunjuk adik dia aku macam siapa ni this one my sister huh your older sister no this one my younger huh tahir pun macam like no cause we thought
all youngest cause tahir youngest aku youngest kau youngest so we thought she also youngest she don't give off the slightly older sister vibe
cause the mum tanya apa like ah this one can trust or not go overseas this one how old already twenty nine twenty three we are turning twenty two
cause we are what nineteen birthday kau dah lepas pe
ah kau nineteen lah twenty eighteen what
tahir nya birthday belum lagi apa so
september ya and then kita balik a few days later birthday dia
eleven cause that time you I got apa tu notified it's on my archive
it's too much already eh now banyak sia kawan aku dah post macam like
um much needed eh apa tu much misses holiday either bali lah patong beach lah all those
aku was there like
lagi apa eh
untuk err buka business yang
sewa itu agak tinggi juga sekolah sewa canteen itu murah lah
ya lah tapi masalah dia
err yang
uh dia dia sekarang dia tahu masak dia pandai masak
ya boleh masak lah tapi
and those kind of things lah macam nasi putih nasi
err jadi saya kena belajar masak dulu lah baru saya boleh buka
sebab because at schools they have err
so kita kena jual benda yang sama
canteen they they cakap they ada
business lain so dia
dia tak ada masa nak jaga dekat situ lah because
so tapi
sekarang now we are
saya tahu lah apa itu kalau tak ada
ya mm maksud saya yang my first wish yang anak-anak jadi baik itu
bukan baik I mean it's baik overall lah it's good
ya so kalau
err tak ada lah tak ingat
with these variations I I I'm a bit like macam old fashioned lah
masa saya pergi india dulu
err ada saya ingat ada satu pak cik
like macam senapang tau
err tapi dia pergi macam
uh paddy field itu ada banyak burung
burung the one
err apa itu yang warna putih itu yang kaki dia panjang itu apa nama dia
so this pakcik
err will go then they they suka hunt these birds
then they bawa
they bawa then people with cook the meat
err but dia punya daging dia agak it's not soft like chicken tapi agak keras juga lah tapi I only remember I had that once
ya itu sahaja saya try
ya tapi sekarang masa itu saya kecil
sekarang now I'm grown up
bukan itu bukan maksud itu err macam jalan-jalan travel saya tak kisah I'm talking about food
food means all food I'm okay with all food except like macam
um saya boleh rasa macam okay just to taste lah once or twice but I will not make it like my daily consumption kind of thing tak ada
yes harap-harap corona ini over lah so we all can
okay let's say I I tengok satu jam atau dua jam
tapi saya saya err I'm
I sekarang saya suka yang not drag too much
story macam dia punya like short stories lah
macam yang err dia punya
kisah itu habis dalam masa let's say for one dalam one hour two hour tak drag drag drag sampai you know for few episodes ah macam itu saya tak ada patience nak tengok macam
ya it's short I mean apa itu orang cakap apa eh
ya macam itu semua saya suka lah
bila eh
oh twenty twenty three they keluar
macam like um I I also like all the superhero movies
no it's not that aku tak suka cuma I didn't err saya tak you know I didn't sit
the most I I think I watch will be spiderman lah yang banyak
yang saya tengok itu mungkin spiderman tak banyak sangat
bukan lah maybe that's what it's uh
so uh saya nak tanya eh
so you after your sekolah kan after your course you want to work where nak kerja dekat mana
yang itu hari err
yang sofian buat what internship itu it's research more to research right
so you pergi
kan sekarang cuti sekolah
tapi uh you mean
tapi yang you
err punya classmate yang dekat A level itu
ada ambil civil civil engineering
no bukan after A level ada your friends take the same course
so um sofian nak
if if you are considering higher education mana awak nak belajar singapore ke overseas
tak boleh lah mana boleh buat apa susah-susah belajar ini then go
ajar budak primary
itu lah saya nak like I said
nak buka business
kalau tak another option would be like macam work from home lah
mah do something like ecommerce ke
normal macam demam macam the normal you know cold flu things no I don't want that for free
err macam you know unexpected
err bayangkan kalau orang itu tak ada duit
then memang orang itu dah stress because of the illness
ya so kalau dia tak ada duit
I wish lah if orang yang macam
so they get I think government ada juga lah bagi untuk orang yang tak mampu tapi I wish they
ya itu maybe we can
tapi yang macam chronically ill and the bill is like very high how
itu satu err swimming sebab sekarang saya tengah belajar swimming
err dekat itu
err apa
ya sebab err coach itu boleh datang
mm dia punya tempat dia ajar itu dekat situ
I mean uh last time saya pernah ada juga pergi
tapi coach itu walaupun dia bagi tiga ratus dollar untuk sepuluh lessons
tapi the coach is like uh not hands on he he
just a coach just expect us to do on our own mm but this one even though we pay four lessons hundred seventy seven tapi each lesson itu
ada dia punya itu lah result
so um berenang itu
because sekarang saya banyak sekarang saya umur empat puluh lima
so sekarang
your you know like macam
ada pilates
satu jam is it a group class
dekat mana jurong
ya yang ini pilates saya bukan cari yang
yang pilates itu ada banyak macam ada banyak jenis yang
with our body just on the mat the yoga mat itu
tapi ada lagi yang pakai equipments
active itu saya kena check kalau dia orang ada the same kind of pilates
kalau ada uh ya obviously I go for that
active belum
saya pernah pakai untuk swimming pool sahaja pernah
no yang saya cakap itu dulu
itu dekat redhill
so far lah because the coach um yang coach can only come there
ya like I said dulu punya coach itu
the coach uh tapi sekarang punya coach itu
at least ada lah ajar sikit-sikit but I know I would I will take with some
sekarang saya punya itu package remain one more lessons only
no bread toast is just I like lah but not mm not I eat something that I eat rest of my life tapi kalau macam
like macam
kalau nak cakap macam gitu apa eh
ah saya tak tahu lah awak
maggi mee
the nasi arab itu
ya smoke sebab smoke itu tak kuat smoke
then it will you know dia akan hilang cepat
itu bukan keras lah itu
ya tak tak tapi
pizza dekat mana
err you need a little bit of minyak sapi
err depends lah if you want to put it all minyak sapi or you can mix with other oils like any other vegetable oil half half
you boleh you boleh letak rempah-rempah dia like kayu manis buah pelaga is
bunga lawa tapi jangan taruh banyak lah because it's only one cup of rice
then cengkih is clove
macam daun salam is basil leaves basil leaves also can put one
err you letak garam
garam then when it when the
water starts to boil you letak itu beras
err nasi minyak you are talking about nasi minyak right
uh nasi minyak kalau ikutkan cara sini
all water they will mix with half half like susu cair
half susu cair half water
no nasi lemak kita letak santan
this is nasi minyak
ya nasi minyak you can also do that way but the taste will be a bit lah
mm then you boleh letak daun pandan daun serai
you know that one is a different taste but if you like it you can do that way also macam you boleh letak tomato
you uh boleh letak chilli hijau semua lah then you put half half lah separuh
uh then the same method you put the uh garam
the other one the taste will be macam kenduri punya nasi lemak lah
ya that one is more like uh is uh more with it goes well with like macam ayam masak merah rendang semua
ya ini nasi minyak simple punya so it goes well with uh curry chicken
ya so you try to make it so maybe you can kau boleh masak dekat sekolah
you punya sekolah itu boleh pakai
you you boleh bawa itu uh
is like it acts like macam bila you nak masak soup with I mean like maggi
boleh nasi boleh lauk pun boleh you only need that one pot which call magic pot I don't know

okay um I nak dengar pasal kak alin punya shopping ke I nak dengar pasal kak alin punya work ke nak dengar pasal kak alin punya wedding
tapi one of the macam
tapi no lah I mean I'll get a shelf for it or something lah for my bags or something
because I remember reading before dia orang kata can just keep
but then so I thought cause my bags now are in their zips dekat dia orang punya zips covered kan in in like its original packaging kita tak buka so it's all just there abeh kita takut ah okay so I thought was safe
abeh I followed his wife macam a luxury person lah okay on instagram abeh dia ada macam Q&A session gitu sometimes abeh dia punya one of dia punya itu is um don't keep it in the original box like take it out it needs to breathe sometimes sometime abeh if you keep it for inside for too long then because it's leather and everything right then um the humidity and also whatever whatever
ya so so I'm worried about it tapi kalau if I ask him to keluarkan
then tak oh my god tapi that time itu saya tengah because saya beli banyak benda kan then I just have this small section in the cupboard now because kakak dia belum keluarkan her clothes
so in that so ada a small section where I can put the stuff lah abeh
you know bila macam nak unboxing or whatever right you want to keep like the the boxes and the the the bags you know what is it called the the yellow bag ah macam all nice gitu kan so woohoo open it up
then tak enough space tau so long as it can I can you gerakkan your tempat baju sikit so that I can more space lepas itu dia how why you just taruh dekat atas lah then no nanti crumple so what it's just a bag case so the thing is kalau kak suruh dia like can you keluarkan this bag just to check the bag I already know how's he handle he's going to handle the bag
nanti dia just macam campak or whatever nanti semua like I don't know nanti macam crumpled or whatever because he just doesn't care for this and ya
so that's why macam oh if I want to check ya probably like check then I have to I have to go there myself
and like check on the bag but the thing is now kak punya kerja like
just nak duduk rumah ya
um because now dia apple boy he got a macbook
then when your contract ends kita sama tak mine is on february
tapi yours is the same kita sama plan kan ada abah
okay ya so this was before ours for ours you got yours or ours okay then then ya but anyway I think dia punya pun end at like end of the year or something like that then probably we'll change to iphone ah
ya then macam all the other laptops macam will
ah then macam not bad ah then like ya macam
macam all the food that abah simpan masih boleh masih boleh pakai seh
then dia okay lah then dia ya
no I just thought macam
I tak tahu I tahu macam when I hear macam the oh the android versus apple whatever macam android punya argument macam their specs is better
and like sea creams like sea cream pastels and dia macam you know that marshmallow and macam round gitu swirly gitu it literally looks at that considering the pathway is not
ah macam film theory
kan film theory on youtube kau dah tengok I feel like ada
I tak tahu fashion so back to the basic
ya cause I tak adventurous so saya tak adventurous
saya takut stick out
okay saya tak tahu ring so
the vibes eh the vibes get a little vaccine also hello it's just it's just tampal there anyway
aku tak tahu period aesthetic tau aesthetic kita tak ada the third eye aesthetic close
kita tak ada vibes kak ada I would say um FOMO
ah ah macam oh she looks nice let me copy that look
I have macam oh okay I like this I don't like that outfit ada lah but macam
it's not like oh I the whole genre of that outfit I suka
ya lah academia lah macam sweater um with like pleats and like straight cut pants
you know kak benda semua dekat my table black and pink
oh so kak limah macam on that scale kak limah macam on a six
I'm fine with that tapi dia end up with um macam best so been tested
um he's kinda like dia just not a nice guy
I don't remember if dia ada err actually I do I don't remember if dia ada err apa macam character change plot whatever what is it called ya character development I don't remember
ya macam huh asal dia ini ya actually all the guys in gossip girl boo humphrey boo they just macam oh oh it's me okay I don't fit in macam okay relax
zero number first affordable need archie bol something like that okay I get it macam kau kaya okay archipelago I teller I david archuleta
weird but no archuleta is doesn't he doesn't even sound macam atas
archie bol dia how to spell archie B O L oh
he's like in the upper class you know cause ya tak humphrey macam humpty dumpty you know he's in the dumps period serena serena van der would said okay she has she has european blood line okay
I mean I'm sure macam small characters lah but the main cast their white
dia macam oh my god brooklyn dekat a part of new york
so macam school high school ya dekat ya the show started dia orang high school that means it's high school season so by the time case dia orang dah kerja dia orang dah kerja some of them kahwin so
dah kahwin dah ah si chuck bass kahwin si blair waldorf si selena kahwin si dan ah I tahu dan lah he main the netflix you know the you the stalker that's dan and then selena is siapa nama selena eh
blake lively selena william selena wiliam sejak bila nak sama tak oh tersay then blair waldorf selena booked dia the waldorf brown hair ah siapa
there's two the main character I would say two girls and three guys two girls three guys ther's one more girl tapi dia macam I think
I was like tak salah lah at the end dia macam
um I at the actress some something and then dia macam tak so so present either like ending last season something like that the actress herself macam problematic something like like that lah dia macam dia macam indecisive punk life then dia macam I think so lah there were some like drama whatever contract tak ingat ah something something but
kalau if I remember correctly she wasn't macam so
I tak tahu I tak tahu dia nak pursue music something like that she had a rock band and that no she's blonde she's like super like platinum blonde and tapi dia ada pakai like eyeliner macam wow macam black the character also not nice
towards the end agaknya lah ya
anyway dia dan punya adik in the show
so there's three guys and then ya I think the two guys if I say the name you don't know who ya because dia orang after gossip girl dia orang tak so popular
no itu
skaters pretty liars ah no pretty liars tak ada boys actually ada boys but dia orang macam not
maybe I don't even know what the guys look like ada ada boys but dia orang macam not so
aria aria the rambut macam besar gila kan

like a kefahaman ah
in other formation gegenpress ah so tak boleh just sembarangan ah ni
the what what clubs other than the english premier league tak ada logo
so so apa uh what what what club are you planning to manage
on aku main is that time time poly is sixteen

which apa brand ah
NVIDIA uh have semua semua all have ah
laptop boleh pakai ke tak untuk
apparently okay for for for for storage data I have a lot memang ada banyak lah

tak baru it's it's quite latest one you know it's two thousand nineteen era
but I don't have the LAN cable cause well is more to you know more to notebook yang flat flat those ah

so and that one is used to for my adik punya apa tu school
which Zoom pun boleh lag

running the whole thing nak type password dah you know when you type your full password then it takes a few second before the password starts to appear ah then
that cleaner equipment last longer blah blah blah but I don't know how my little brother pakai you know go to school carry here carry there sometimes go to

takde tak I I I've seen the
english punya league
cam the championship league one league two blah blah blah blah blah you know

regulate themselves dissolve all the useless clubs cause I think it's too much imagine kalau you know

dengan member member dia uh kat bawah block
then main bola sampai pukul sepuluh balik

he has to play football I think it's not no longer fun anymore ah abeh takkan takkan seh eh
nak main bola like every single day at this certain time wearing this certain jersey with certain boot I think it's a bit
whatever it is ah but there's a lot of african kid who's buncit so I can relate
