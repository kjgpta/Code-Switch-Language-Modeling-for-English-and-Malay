<malay>apa macam</malay>
okay [lah] all's good all is good so
how
the situation <malay>sekarang</malay> COVID
(um)
(err) for me
I guess is like
okay [lah] lesser
customers
but
ya because got crowd control so <malay>ada banyak-banyak</malay> timing so
<malay>tengok</malay> timing [lah] <malay>selalu kalau</malay> timing <malay>jam satu gitu lepas</malay> lunch [ah]
<malay>banyak orang</malay> because they all rush in
ya [ah] then especially <malay>kalau pakai</malay> mask [kan] [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
so it's so hard for people to no be able to listen then it's like I try to raise my voice but then I feel like
[ah] [kan] ya then I don't know I feel I feel like I a bit rude but at the same time is just <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>orang pekak</malay> so <malay>biarkan</malay> [jer]
so how other than
work how else is the pandemic
[ah] [ah] [seh] just to [ah] <malay>kalau pergi</malay> shopping mall <malay>pun susah</malay> [kan] <malay>walaupun nak beli</malay> like one thing only like bubble tea
[kan] [kan] like (um) so sometimes like we just want to <malay>minum air</malay> and then like people just suddenly stare at you like chill I just I just drinking water
ya [lah] #rilek# [ah] okay water break
but ya I think (uh) one of my pet peeves I guess is
<malay>orang pakai</malay> mask but never cover the nose like
[kan] like what's the point bro you sneeze from your nose not from your mouth so you cover your mouth for what
and
[ah] <malay>kenapa</malay>
(mm)
[eh] <malay>apa dia buat</malay>
you know
so it's just just from her face
(mmhmm) and then <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>apa lagi dia buat</malay>
like a gangster [seh] but then
okay (uh) were there other people that felt the same way as you
(um)
(um)
(um)
[ah] so like two face
basically okay [lah] <malay>dua macam dua alam</malay> like malay call it <malay>dua alam</malay>
just marker
I think (uh)
because
I tried going on dating apps [ah] you know ya ya ya Tinder Muzmatch ya especially that so <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>kat sana</malay> then
it's just the way that they text the way that they reply sometimes I don't like you know sometimes like the way they spell certain stuff you know like you can just say it to me in like one long sentence but you have to <malay>kasi</malay> short form <malay>macam</malay>
you know for what ya so so it's just like
maybe
<malay>kadang-kadang kalau jumpa</malay>
some of them are okay [jer]
(uh) they are actually quite hype they they they <malay>boleh berbual</malay> [ah] everything but
but it's just you know it's just a stupid reason for me to just like [ah]
you know what I I don't really like you know talking to you you know like just (ugh) very cringe but it's just you know sadly some some of them are actually nice it's just <malay>suka</malay> it's just a preference
ya it does
ya ya ya ya
ya but but this is why I guess
we
as millennials I guess or gen Z or whatever okay you you millennial right because you are older
ya but
because we we put ourselves online
you know even especially this recording is also online ya so
ya precisely
so ya talking about that <malay>tu pun</malay>
actually is good for you to hide yourself like you know on social media especially
(um) if you do want to
go on dating apps
I suggest you can use a different name
can still use your picture obviously because if not it will be catfish [lah] technically <malay>kalau</malay>
well technically but like at least is still obvious right
right so so <malay>macam kat</malay> Telegram or what then you send the video message thing at least they know like [ah] okay this person is this face but the name
<malay>lain</malay> [lah] but <malay>tu</malay> [jer] maybe your age <malay>lain sikit</malay> maybe your birthday <malay>lain sikit</malay>
okay that [one] K K K okay that [one] case [lah] but like ya that [one] that [one] is like but ya I got see a lot of people
on Tinder also [oh] okay say they put in their bio like
hi I'm actually seventeen or like fifteen then I I just straight away report they just fake their birthday [lah] but straight away we report [lah] because it's like
just imagine if
okay maybe one of us who are like twenty one years old <malay>nak berbual dengan dorang</malay> then <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> I don't know <malay>kena</malay>
(um) a police read or something for some reason and then it's like they ask [oh] why you talking to a minor and then just like
I don't know she was a minor because she never put in her bio or something and then who's fault is it you whose [one] handcuffs [ah] you you <malay>kena</malay>
you <malay>kena</malay> what house arrest [ah] that [one]
you <malay>kena</malay> the watch on the
I feel like we doing podcast but ya well
<malay>betul betul betul okay (uh)</malay>
(um)
I think maybe to a certain extent <malay>boleh macam</malay>
for example you are from a royal family or something or you are someone very very important you know [ah] ya [sia] but then ya it depends on the situation but
<malay>macam orang yang buat macam gini</malay> just to be like a predator or something that [one] is a no no
ya
you going to get bitten
okay [ah] so <malay>hari ni makan apa tadi tadi makan apa</malay>
(um)
Maggi Maggi cup [jer]
[ah] [lah] <malay>takpe sama</malay> I had the Nissin seafood one very nice
which one is it the indomie one
seven eleven one [ah] [ah] okay [lah] not bad <malay>sedap juga</malay>
[eh] <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
karma !wow!
I wonder what they serve
trauma in karma
but then I heard (uh)
okay [lah] I just google [lah] just now they have no menu so how [ah]
I feel like
it will be a full course meal starting from
starters appetiser and then all the way until dessert
sorry I never go restaurant before but
ya either way ya it's like the seven levels of hell basically I feel like
ya
but ya if if karma were to serve me something right it will be
revenge I feel like
from
#lek# [ah] #lek# #lek# #lek# #lek# #lek#
(uh) it's just
because back then in school [ah] now I working full-time already [lah] [ah] so
<malay>dulu bila kat sekolah</malay> it's just (um)
(uh) I made a lot of enemies because somehow some way people just don't like me and is like is like some kind of an algorithm
for at the end at the end of every school year right I will lose all my friends
ya ya well I don't know if I lose to them or they lose to me [lah] but
either way is this
ya I still remember one occasion
[ah] secondary school
I had a crush on this girl so <malay>biasa</malay> [lah] [eh] like <malay>cinta monyet</malay> everything and then just <malay>macam</malay> [oh] my god secondary school <malay>ada mata air baru</malay>
and then <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>kawan ni</malay> from primary school
and then (uh) well I have it's just like you like I had a sus feeling you know like the vibes and everything so so okay but I still ignore [lah] cause I thought like <malay>mana tahu</malay> secondary school it's a different [ah] ya ya ya like even though it's like primary six to sec one
but ya because like [oh] my god first major exam so like you expect people to at least
just
<malay>dah</malay> mature a bit [lah] [ah]
but then well [ah] long story short
it's just a
when I
I was talking to the guy on the phone and everything I <malay>selalu bawa dia</malay> <malay>ajak dia</malay> into the conference call like that because okay [lah] me being you know seeing her as my
best friend at that point of time <malay>macam</malay>
you know I want to include you and everything I do so like I <malay>tak malu</malay> [lah] ya so but then it's just the the stupid thing is that (um)
that night where (err)
before before that night a few days before the dude and I <malay>dah</malay> confess so so we we okay [lah] we say that [oh] I like I like you too and everything it's cute but then the thing is we confess at playground with letters we roll each other letters you know ya right it's not over over text like I I state my no [lah]
whether now so
so on the night we were talking and everything then I ask him [lah] like do you do you want to go to the next level <malay>gitu biasa</malay> [lah] [eh] you know I <malay>dah</malay> desperate [kan] so and then he like [ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [jer] like I okay because I <malay>suka</malay> you and everything and I'm like !aww! okay <malay>apa-apa</malay> [jer] [lah] so as long as you and I together
<malay>cinta monyet</malay> I just said it
ya but for us we don't use puppy we use <malay>monyet</malay> so <malay>monyet</malay> because it's ya it's playful basically because we
we see monkeys as very playful so like that [lah] but I feel like <malay>kalau</malay> puppy love is quite cute
you know like those kind (err) high school sweetheart kind of thing it's a no from me
[oh] shit okay no no
and then
where was I [ah] so during the phone call and then we were talking like that and then my best friend was there then <malay>dia dengar</malay> [jer] [lah] so she just like okay <malay>tak tak kepoh</malay> [lah] because I <malay>ajak</malay> so it's fine <malay>macam</malay> member <malay>sunyi</malay>
ya so after that
(uh) so I guess on that night we just decided to be together to be in a relationship not me and my best friend my and the guy so
so somehow right the next day
the whole school his whole cohort <malay>dapat tahu</malay> that
his girlfriend is me then I was like who [sia] who spread and then obviously the first person that I suspected was not even my best friend you know that was how much I love her I want to say like but that sounded a bit
ya I mean that's how much I <malay>sayang</malay> her as a friend [lah] that I the first person that I look to is my ex that time so and then he was like <malay>takde</malay> [ah] <malay>takde cakap apa-apa</malay> like you think I that kind of person to share and like that then I was like okay [lah] <malay>mana tahu</malay>
ya but then then [ah]
after that we I just like okay [lah] <malay>takpe</malay> I <malay>lupakan</malay> [jer] and then
(um) before me and the guy
(err) talk right
he like another girl and
<malay>yang perempuan tu suka dia juga</malay> so ya (hmm) <malay>tak</malay> player is he he's just never been in a relationship before except except for with me
ya so
ya secondary school anything can happen so
<malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] so <malay>lepas tu</malay>
(err) I talk to my best friend [lah] and say like [oh] why who who do you think spread and everything then she like [ah] I don't know you know everything then I was like ya true I also don't know because the thing is that I somehow I was too dumb to realise that she was also in that call yesterday [lah] like I didn't remember that fact
you know and then
the girl that used to like my ex (uh) before my ex and I got together she she hated me [lah] cause I so called <malay>aku rampas dia punya</malay>
<malay>dia nya laki</malay>
ya then <malay>aku macam</malay>
bro you you never make your first move how how is it my fault precisely how is it my fault also ya sure <malay>korang suka</malay> each other but if if I like him and then somehow he fell for me also and then okay [lah] then that means I I put in effort [what] and unlike you you just you just like you see from afar and just like hi then for me it's just like
ya that's true [sia]
that's why okay that's why you know the phrase where
some some people do say that [oh] I prefer befriending those on ya ya ya
some of them is like that because they will act like everything is just like [oh] hi let me ask guy best friend first
[ah] <malay>padahal dorang</malay> <malay>ke apa</malay> okay no hate [lah] [sia] no hate but it's just
some of you all you just don't try to act innocent when you're not [lah]
ya
but
but that's why for me is that I prefer
how do you [ah] say I prefer
not spending time I prefer befriending ya I forgot the word befriending <malay>dengan lelaki</malay> and everything because they very chill sure you need to find the balance between the guy friends [lah]
(um)
ya ya ya ya ya
(um)
ya but [ah] I got I got those kind of friend before I just drop
because <malay>tak buang waktu</malay> [sia] like <malay>kau</malay>
<malay>kau penat-penat kau berbual dengan dorang kau lepak dengan dorang</malay> and then <malay>setakat</malay> they just like [eh] your friend single or not then like what the fuck bro
ya
[eh] ya I want off topic [sia] but okay your turn your turn I I go I go back #jurong# [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
example
<malay>sikit</malay> [jer] <malay>ke banyak ni</malay>
check out rhythm skins in latin
who knows
ya but
ya I guess karma is technically revenge [lah] but not from the person itself but it's just from the world
ya (mmhmm) thanks
ya I guess (um)
if okay if you okay for example if you were the restaurant yourself if you were karma yourself what would you do
for supper
not for yourself [lah] not so bad [lah] for for anybody that you feel like
deserves maybe you guys never you never end it off properly <malay>macam tak sedap</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> not
I guess
okay
(mmhmm)
in what sense
[oh] bro is is he living up to the quote of like every great woman is there's a great man behind or something I know it's the opposite [lah] but
but let's say
[ah] then that means
dude
do you feel like they are insecure of themselves when they say that [kan] (um)
(um)
(um)
<malay>betul betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
[ah] ya my ex also did that
(um)
to a certain extent
or snobbish also
exactly in twenty twenty please get therapy
ya
steep cut but <malay>kau tak cakap apa-apa</malay> then why why would he
even
okay this [one] I cannot brain
women also the same [what]
I guess in a sense
(um) (um)
ya because I feel like we
we don't have to mansplain stuff
right is that the word
so we okay if we say that [oh] my god I was
I I <malay>tadi marah</malay> because <malay>ada orang terlanggar</malay> you know then like your girlfriend will just rely [a'ah] I <malay>faham faham</malay> but if you tell a guy is just like
<malay>setakat dia cuma langgar</malay> [jer] [pe] [ah] like that wait maybe maybe I can say we are too sensitive or <malay>kita</malay> overreact but
I don't know ya it's just a bit only not asking for much
(hmm) <malay>tu</malay> [lah] get out but I got this story back when I was in I had this classmate she was very clingy <malay>gitu macam dia</malay>
<malay>dia dia tak ada banyak kawan</malay> [lah] because <malay>dia pendiam</malay> then <malay>bila orang</malay>
I the self-proclaimed resting bitch face basically
ya like very edgy in a sense
no [lah] you normal [lah]
yes
but then for her is just
<malay>sama-sama</malay> but for her it's just how to say [ah]
it was very hard to try to make her open up as in not open up to her secrets or whatever it's just talk to me like a normal person that's it and then it came to the point where she became clingy at first for me I I she said that I was clingy because I was trying too hard to become her friend but then I was like
<malay>setakat aku nak kawan dengan semua orang dalam</malay> class so
<malay>kalau apa-apa nak berbual</malay> it's okay [lah] like rather than you just have beef with everyone like for what and then
<malay>lepas tu</malay>
(err)
<malay>lepas tu</malay> she became clingy then <malay>mana-mana aku pergi dia nak ikut</malay> then it's like [ah] <malay>dia dia perangai macam lelaki</malay> like she insecure [lah] because she she's afraid of people abandoning her so when I talk to other classmates she will just like
[eh] <malay>asal kau berbual dengan dia</malay> [sia] then <malay>aku macam</malay>
<malay>biar</malay> [ah] <malay>aku nak berbual dengan siapa</malay> and then it's like and then it's like <malay>ada</malay> [ah] project and everything so for project work
I had to choose [ah] I was given finally given the chance to choose my own group because <malay>dulu</malay> is <malay>dorang main ambil</malay> [jer] [lah] which
which was sad because I had those free loaders and everything and <malay>lepas tu</malay> I didn't pick her because she herself was the free loader
but she she she never realise because <malay>sebagai kawan</malay> I never <malay>tegur</malay> because out of <malay>kesian</malay> right you know like it's your own friend you <malay>sayang</malay> your friend and everything
and then after that
and then she she text me she sound me and everything she say why why you never pick me for your group and then <malay>aku cakap</malay>
[oh] [ah] <malay>aku tak</malay> pick <malay>pun dorang yang</malay> pick <malay>aku</malay>
I <malay>bohong</malay> [ah] because I don't want her to get hurt but in the end she did and then in the end she found out [lah] ya and then she
and then <malay>bila tengah buat</malay> project then she will complain like (uh) you know <malay>akunya</malay> group <malay>macam gini macam gitu</malay> then
and then like [oh] how I wish I was in your group then I say [oh] ya same how I wish I and my friend were in my group but at that point of time I already started this liking because the way she was being very possessive and jealous over me even though we were just friends ya
(um) ya precisely unless you're married [lah] that [one] I think
a bit can
it's
ya
okay we're just single [lah] that's why we talk about this
but that [one] I feel like for everyone is normal you know if everyone if everyone if someone just overly control you you would just feel <malay>tak sedap hati macam apa</malay> [sia] <malay>aku buat aku dengan kau siapa</malay> [sia] <malay>kawan</malay> [jer]
ya but maybe for me is just I don't like the way you text so bye bye
so okay I I got I always ask this question if if you had three wishes
what
will you do with it I mean what would you wish for [lah] you know you know like those eleven eleven kind of thing
true I agree
so okay if everything was free how will you obtain those materials
forming [oh] farming how do you farm an iphone
ya how
what
okay she she living in thirty thirty one can farm an iphone
well I guess but we need a lot of land though singapore don't have a lot of land how [ah]
get a rooftop
then for the next wish okay other than the first wish will be everything will be free second
[oh]
wish
so explain your comfort characters (um)
ya anime anime ya
can you imagine he just pop up and just answer you
I see okay so
maybe you should manifest some cash
okay [lah] just share share <malay>sikit</malay> [leh] <malay>dengan</malay>
okay so what what
okay so secondary wish is your comfort characters third wish
[oh] that's cute
okay if if your cats were to talk right okay for all your cats that you have
how would you
how how do think they will they will talk to you for example #gizmo#
what do you do
give them a character ya ya ya ya ya
<malay>lepak bawah blok</malay> [eh] [ah]
okay that's cute I guess <malay>macam abang-abang</malay> [ah] <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] <malay>abang-abang yang bulat</malay> [ah] (um) [ah] <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
okay then your other cats
[oh] <malay>sombong</malay> [eh] [ah] [oh] ya that's true
do you think she will be like the queen bee of the school
okay ya got some people just like that like
ya some some people are just naturally very attractive but
ya they very nice
ya maybe she'll be like what your big sister kind of character that will be cute
am I I I I guess maybe
and then okay your other cats
<malay>cakap</malay> [jer] [lah]
you live with them [what] that's why I'm asking you
[oh] that's cute !alah!
so <malay>cili padi</malay> is like small and feisty and spicy
[oh] damn
I see okay I see
member <malay>kucing ke</malay> robot <malay>pun tak tahu</malay>
(mmhmm)
[ah] so the youngest all the very <malay>degil-degil bukan ke</malay> [oh] shit
what
ya
!alah! but so high so high with energy maybe maybe [oh] but with other people a bit [oh] <malay>malu-malu</malay>
okay [lah] makes sense (mmhmm)
so <malay>dia dia tinggal kat rumah atau</malay>
something like a lot of
but is a cat a lost kitty
[ah]
<malay>kenapa kau yang jumpa atau</malay> your family members your other family members [oh]
<malay>anak derhaka ni lu dengar</malay> [eh] <malay>dengar</malay> [eh]
[ah] okay [lah] at least (um)
dear you still have #gizmo# I know you you sure #gizmo# a lot
and and and
(mmhmm) ya ya her name is baby
damn okay
[ah] okay how how you take a cat home
in the carrier !wow! the love ya
[ah]
cute
so does she give more or does she want more attention
!wow! that's cute (um) !alah! cute <malay>nya tak payah beli bantal ada kucing</malay>
[ah] [kan]
no you you can have more cats than you know than more boyfriends so
and it's and it's and it's socially acceptable
okay [what] at least you're not spending money on someone who who can cheat you know which cat would cheat on you
right most to most is just get fat that's it
it's fine I can always you know help you
ya get
get I don't know get scratched I guess no the thing is I like cats but
sometimes I'm afraid to approach them
I mean you live with them
[ah]
how then the cat never fight back
[ah] that's true trust on trust
yes if you don't trust there's nothing nothing will happen so many things
[ah] that's true true like if animals were to like you except for insects
no thanks that [one] a bit sus
no we got a problem officer
so okay between cats and dogs
okay
I was thinking of something but okay thanks
why in what sense
that's
[oh]
(um)
(mmhmm)
okay that that makes sense but you know about the law where they they are forbidding people from having cats in
ya ya but demonising but ya it's just I feel like it's unfair because
for from my perspective right cats
they are cleaner and they are they make less noise the most to most they are meows are just very soft
when they run around
damn okay
so so animals are like that also okay
ya
ya [sial] [ah] who who ask you ghost
ya
but
ya I got around my neighbourhood if I do see the big dogs they are fine they are chill it's just the small dogs I don't know for some reason they just want to approach you like don't don't
ya
glass panel
is the one at the door right the gate right
specific [eh]
because you angry
what why !wah! so specific what you do [sia]
ya
[ah] (mmhmm)
(uh huh)
I don't I don't understand [sia] like I feel like they they have some kind of hate or anger inside them to the point where they can just hate so much
[ah] so that's why you call <malay>cili padi</malay>
okay ya that's right
but but if you are below one five zero that one is a different kind of temper honestly
serious
ya because it's all compressed
ya it's all compressed so if you are ya if you are power
ya that's all the short guys don't date short guys
from experience maybe it's just a stereotype please don't take this too hard
well okay
I wish I had a cat
but I feel like
I don't know I'll be so emotionally attached to it
I don't know I I emotionally attached to a lot of things for example my water bottle or whatever is it can be quite toxic ya (mmhmm) don't make me sound so old please
so so it's like
nah I'm not single I'm I'm I'm single but not ready to mingle okay but
<malay>apa</malay>
but ya ya I think I'm those kind of grandmothers I think like with the family heirloom that I just I just pass pass down my granddaughter my bottle that she cannot do anything about it she sell also people will just realise it's just a normal bottle that's not much value
well gen gen Z gen #zentiment#
okay [lah] I guess ya that would be our labels from society right like gen Z and just [ah] strawberry generation [lah] all those kind of shit
but things are done [what]
like everyone is struggling in their own things it's I don't know
yes
yes
precisely
of course they can [lah] the competition not that much
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
I I agree but because because it's true because I mean everyone is facing the same thing no matter how how much of
how much pressure that are getting [lah] so very little or what I mean I feel like
the future generations will also feel more pressure because there will be
too many things happening at once especially the pandemic now like
are home based learning okay [lah] a lot of people struggling especially those who
are either starting their first year of like you know or poly just [ah] tertiary education or like even
on their last year of school
it's just like
it's a very [ah] ya I don't know what to do kind of thing
content morning but game is a
(um)
so it what it's saturday sunday just
ya I mean for school I understand but for work
(uh huh) so so
by monday to friday so she had like rush it through and
damn
I'm just amazed at the fact that okay I mean sure working throughout the weekend but who has a meeting at ten until one okay maybe makes sense because timezone ya
but still
ya
well
okay other than school
but I feel like ya well
we all trying our best [lor] so
<malay>macam</malay> especially
you know they were like like what you said just now like [oh] I did back in my days it was easier and then like now is just like there's so much competition there's so much you know if you want to study for example nursing a lot of people are taking nursing now because of the pandemic and then [ah] you know like now even the tourism industry is just basically dead
you know like (err) ya and then like it's it's just sad because
so much time wasted so many people getting retrenched and everything
I mean at least we get to you know some of us maybe we are from like
[ah] from our business background then we go into like
medical background or like vice versa you know that works also
but I don't know how it will play out after
how many years [lah] I feel like
it will stay for quite long
getting
no no it's just about the world we we never mention any ya
ya but but also like culture wise you know like I feel like there's still this thing about tattoos and going around
ya and I thought that you know at work it was like some kind of offense you know with the law that [oh] you cannot have tattoos but then when I ask around is just is just the culture
or any kind of physical [ah] body modifications I was about to say mutilations
ya but
it's nice [oh] especially it's just weird that
you know if you go to poly university can colour your hair you can do whatever but then like
ya brown dark brown
slightly dark
ya but (hmm) that's it
ya it's just it's just <malay>ayam masak</malay> ya that's true
it's just chicken that has been un-raw
