really
honestly <malay>aku tak ingat</malay> because
my group was the first group to go off so we couldn't watch the movie (uh)

it's literally next to the <malay>madrasah</malay> it's the I think the the founder of the <malay>sekolah punya</malay> family #aljunied# ya
[oh] because that used to be <malay>dia punya tempat</malay> [ah] like is it like the [ha] the <malay>tanah</malay> or the <malay>kampung</malay> where most of them <malay>tinggal kat situ</malay> [ah]

what is it <malay>asal</malay> why is it called <malay>raya</malay>
ya
ya which reminds me of the incredible tales because <malay>ada</malay> this one episode where
<malay>ada</malay> this group of students <malay>dia pergi</malay> this one area <malay>kat</malay>
I think indonesia and then while they were going up to the <malay>tempat</malay> [kan]
they met (um) some of the some of the people [lah] then they they told them (um) [ah] they went to the shop and then
(uh) they <malay>dia orang</malay>
I don't know if it's a <malay>bomoh</malay> but I think and then she <malay>macam</malay> advice <malay>dia orang</malay> [kan] <malay>dia dia</malay> she advise them about the <malay>macam pantang larang gitu</malay> and then
they violated every single one of them
[a'ah] <malay>yang tu yang tu</malay> [ha] ya
like that [one] is
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] [oh] they they call it
#nananggal# <malay>tak salah</malay>
no [leh]
no no they the it's #nananggal# not <malay>penanggal</malay>
[eh] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] cause [oh]
[oh] so
ya
ya
[oh] <malay>apa</malay> they malay peninsular so <malay>sama hantu</malay> [lah]
so it's not
it's because when I first saw it [kan] [oh] !chey! okay no because I thought at first it's a <malay>pontianak</malay> but then the <malay>cerita tunjukkan</malay> [kan] because the girl was pregnant then she hit the fact from the other friends
so [kan] that thing will
(uh) incredible tales ya that episode no no
ya
[ah] hanging ya
ya
[ah]
okay
[oh] [ah]
ya <malay>kat</malay> singapore
<malay>aku tak pernah nampak</malay> okay okay then
[ah]
that sounds dangerous
[ah]
[ah]
which makes me wonder [tau] because [kan] <malay>dia orang patut</malay> [kan] they can go through
like solid objects <malay>tak boleh</malay> affect them [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> they get stuck
[oh] <malay>amal pengamal</malay> (oo)
(mm)
okay
so he go out and then read
okay
<malay>tu yang aku tak faham</malay> like you would take you would pay lots of money
to <malay>apa tu</malay> get the services of
like <malay>jin dengan bomoh tapi</malay> like <malay>benda</malay> surgery <malay>kau tak nak</malay>
ya <malay>apa yang</malay> natural it's supernatural
okay fine
ya
<malay>seram</malay> [ah] wait then what's the purpose of the <malay>penanggal</malay> like
[oh] [oh] [oh]
I know [oh] the I don't know what's the purpose <malay>tapi aku tahu</malay> like <malay>dekat</malay> episode <malay>tu</malay> they show
(um) that thing was going after the <malay>perempuan yang</malay> pregnant
ya but why I don't know [lah]
what's that
!chey! okay
<malay>apa dia</malay>
I know because like one reasons is because <malay>macam</malay> like they are more vulnerable and then they are <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
like they are more vulnerable because they <malay>ada benda yang orang lain nak tapi tak tak ada tak dapat</malay>
so they try to like steal it from them which is <malay>apa tu</malay> the baby [lah] it's like new life
[a'ah] ya ya <malay>ada ada</malay>
I think
ya ya ya (uh) something right ya [ah]
I mean <malay>kita dah berbual pasal ayat lain semua</malay>
ya <malay>itu</malay> that [one] just
because they they either <malay>makan</malay> the <malay>anak atau</malay> they <malay>curi</malay> the <malay>anak atau</malay> they <malay>ikat</malay> the <malay>rahim</malay> !eww!
ya like finally I know what's the purpose of that [eh] <malay>dia letak garam</malay> [kan] <malay>tak</malay> [eh] <malay>garam</malay>
I'm kind of I don't know this I don't know what's some isn't gonna miss
ya <malay>aku dengar</malay> like if you <malay>letak garam kat luar</malay> your <malay>pintu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> anyone [ha] anyone who <malay>masuk rumah kalau dia ada simpan benda</malay> [kan] that <malay>benda</malay> cannot <malay>masuk rumah</malay>
maybe [ah] it's one of the ways [ah] <malay>yang ada</malay>
<malay>daun</malay>
<malay>sirih</malay> [eh]
<malay>sihir</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [seh] <malay>aku tak pernah dengar</malay> is it <malay>melayu punya</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [seh]
[oh] <malay>kirakan macam</malay>
they make it they package it [ah] so easy to use [ha]
ya ya ya
they make it into a <malay>sabun</malay> [kan] so <malay>senang</malay>
packaging in marketing
ya
<malay>sambut</malay> what do you mean
[oh] I thought is the doctor [what] or the nurse
hospital legit [ah]
[eh] [a'ah] [a'ah] <malay>apa tu yang</malay> the son of a peach <malay>punya cerita</malay> [kan] they were saying <malay>macam</malay> this hospital <malay>dia cakap</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia tengah beranak</malay> [kan] and then she saw a white figure then the nurse <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] that [one] is normal usually when people give birth they always see that figure
ya
[ha]
so <malay>kirakan macam kalau</malay> like you give birth
but then someone <malay>benda lain</malay> might be
what the hell
so is that is that why like hospitals are haunted
deaths
cause thinking <malay>macam sebab</malay> maternity work [kan] like babies <malay>baru keluar</malay>
so it's <malay>seram</malay> [seh] but then <malay>kalau macam</malay> you are if you are in the operating room [kan] and then <malay>kau baru</malay> give birth you know that the doctor is the one that's taking you right
[oh] that's why that [one] <malay>macam</malay> make sure <malay>kalau kau kat dalam</malay> [kan] you have someone like your family there so they can [ha] okay okay
[ah]
[oh] but then <malay>masih baru</malay> [kan] the
sorry [ah] but I have like submissions and an exam coming up
it's like you want to disturb me come back in like two hours let me finish this and submit
yes let me do this until two three five night then you come okay
ya
[oh] ya ya ya <malay>tidur mati</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>kau tak baca doa tidur</malay> [eh] <malay>asal</malay> [eh]
[oh] is it
(oo) so if it wakes you up then different story [ah] [ha] <malay>bodoh</malay> [lah]
ya
but <malay>apa yang dia</malay> call it <malay>apa</malay> (err) it's not <malay>khayalan</malay> it's like
your imagination [eh]
it's like it's your
imagination [eh] [a'ah] ya [ha]
because very vivid ya
ya <malay>betul</malay>
no ya that's what I found out actually actually this [one] the son of a peach also he he posts
the he looked up the stuff [kan] then he saw that actually <malay>jin dengan</malay> you cannot see <malay>jin</malay> and <malay>syaitan</malay> because they are in a different dimension ya so
ya [oh] no no cannot cannot
ya so what happens is that because <malay>kau kena apa tu hasut</malay> [kan]
so whatever that you see is actually just
<malay>macam</malay> is just playing in your head so the <malay>syaitan hasut</malay> you and then <malay>kirakan</malay> they like they are the ones that showing you these images in your head but actually you cannot see them because if you can see if you can see them means you can see the entire dimension [tau] everything that exist in that dimension
ya
true ya
they play with your mind ya ya
(mm)
ya <malay>macam</malay> that's why <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>nampak benda tapi orang lain tak nampak</malay> [kan] ya
ya
[seh] okay
ya
also <malay>orang lain yang kena</malay> [ah]
ya
disturb the people around them
ya
<malay>kurang asam</malay>
[oh] no wonder
tap
[oh] tap [ha]
(mmhmm)
<malay>kau pergi jahit malam-malam apa cerita</malay> okay
ya
(mm)
wait so that's one of the ways they <malay>kacau</malay> you [ah]
so <malay>kirakan dia orang</malay> actually <malay>pegang kau</malay> or they just make you think that <malay>ada orang pegang kau</malay>
okay okay okay I don't know
[eh] [a'ah] [eh] poltergeist
[ha] <malay>dia orang selalu buat</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like those supernatural <malay>punya</malay> like
paranormal [eh]
ya
ya I remember I watched the one <malay>yang kat</malay> malaysia [kan] where they the the whole entire team
<malay>kat luar rumah</malay> and then they will send someone into the one of the rooms and then the person will be lying on the ground
and then like <malay>baca-baca</malay> something basically like inviting the <malay>hantu gitu</malay> [ah]
ya but then it's like damn scary because <malay>apa tu</malay>
like the the thing will come to them right and then <malay>apa tu</malay>
the thing will come to the person
and then (err) like they will start like bordering the
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] the the <malay>pintu semua gerak</malay> and then they will see like lights and then they will hear sounds and everything
and then and then the person will like try to exit to go back to <malay>dia punya</malay> the team outside right
then like I don't know whether it's true or not because
like usually when they go out they we have like a a <malay>bomoh</malay> on standby <malay>gitu</malay> ya
ya like in case if anything happens [kan]
and then when they go until they will like it it's always like <malay>dia orang macam</malay> trembling or shivering or they say like <malay>dia orang ada rasa benda</malay>
and then like how do you know whether it's true or not
I mean ya but then
(oo) [ah] ya
(mm)
then
singapore
ya why [ah] is it like singapore like <malay>dia orang tak kacau sangat</malay>
!huh!
so you telling me that the <malay>hantu</malay> also like shifted back to the <malay>kampung</malay> then [oh] it became less popular [eh] less demand
ya
(mm)
[oh] I think it's because like is it like people in singapore <malay>tak</malay> practise as much as those
and also because like we don't have much of the resources <malay>juga</malay> [ah] ya really like maybe <malay>ada memang ada</malay> [lah] but like
modernised [eh]
we are religious
ya
[a'ah] [sia]
ya that's true
and like the <malay>pantang larang</malay> for <malay>bomoh</malay> right is more
ya it's so <malay>leceh satu</malay> and then it's like for the rest of your life or for as long as you are using it [kan] but for if you go for plastic surgery it's like
only two three months recovery then can already
ya
no [lah] for boobs it's like you need to change
every like ten years or five years ya
that [one] I don't know [ah] I think maybe it's just the expiry date or what
probably but ya [ha]
it's troublesome
