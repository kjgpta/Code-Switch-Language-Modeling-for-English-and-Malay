hello my name is #hady#
hello #faidil# (um) how have you been
(um) !wow! that sounds great <malay>aku</malay> past few days <malay>aku tak buat apa-apa yang menarik sangat aku cuma duduk dekat rumah</malay> [jer] <malay>tengok</malay>
<malay>adik-beradik aku tengah belajar bapa aku kerja kawan aku semua sibuk dia kerja tengah dekat sekolah</malay>
so ya I haven't been out too much lately but I hope it will change in the next few days
okay so I have (um) the first question for you my first question is (um) just the other day I was walking outside (um) an apple store at white sands shopping mall
and I was looking inside and I saw they were selling this new phone [ah] that apple just released I think probably about a month or two ago retailing about maybe eight hundred nine hundred dollars plus
and I went into the store and I took a look at the phones and I was just comparing it with the old models and I didn't actually notice much of a significant difference in the looks and I read up on the performance not that much of a difference and I was just asking myself (um) I was wondering why would people fork out such huge amount of money for phone that is so insignificant in its performance or visuals compared to its (um)
previous models I just wanted to know your thoughts on that
(um) for me I would one hundred percent say with certainty that I do not think that phones in general should be retailing at four digits like one thousand dollars personally
I like to think that anything above five hundred dollars really is more of a luxury rather than the necessity
and I personally think that there are way more quality phones that you can get the super underrated for less than five hundred dollars and I think it's quite sad to see a company like apple maybe take advantage of maybe hardcore users by simply releasing phones that
are way out of the average person's price range and
I feel like it's obviously a bit sad to see from where it came from from the past years and you know these phones that come in at four digits are not really much to brag about in terms of any innovation that it possesses compared to maybe an iphone that came out two to three years ago and I'll be personally disappointed if I was a fan of apple and see with what they come up with
and I just think that since phones are such a necessity in our daily lives I feel like a one should strive
to aim for a balanced price range versus a top quality performance of a iphone
so ya I mean
<malay>aku rasa</malay>
<malay>janganlah kita buang duit nak beli</malay> handphone <malay>yang mahal-mahal tapi tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>beza sangat dengan</malay> handphone <malay>yang lama</malay> [kan]
so ya that's my opinion
(um) my second question for you is the past few days the weather in singapore has been really hot
and with (err) the importance of us wearing mask outside with COVID going on how have you been coping with the blazing weather so far
[ah] ya for sure I agree
it's crazy to see what the weather is like nowadays you think that living in singapore for twenty years you get adjusted to the humid weather but it seems that everyday it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and obviously we can attribute it to
whatever you know the climate or climate change or you know but I do agree that I think the only way that we can you know try to battle this weather is to stay hydrated keep drinking lots of water and try to get to cool places as often as you can don't stay out in the heat for your own sake
(um) ya and please don't forget to wear your mask cause for the wellbeing of the people around us
and my next question for you is what is one thing that you wish was free
(um) ya (um) that I totally agree with you
I can empathise with with having friends who (um) don't have great vision and seeing them fork out a few hundred dollars on something that they need
which is the spectacles and obviously is not going to be easy for everyone to afford you know cause
obviously spectacles are very expensive although it is a necessity and if I had one thing that I wish was free I would say something along similar lines I'd say I wish that healthcare was free
cause it's as a person who has been to hospital trips a few times and I've seen the amount of money that not just me but maybe the people around me have to fork out
just to pay their hospital bills and obviously in singapore is I'm very thankful that the government helps us a lot in subsidies but obviously healthcare is also important in singapore first first class
hospitals here and first class treatment and I guess can't take for granted the subsidies that the government gives but
mostly <malay>kalau aku boleh mimpi</malay> [lah] <malay>satu hari</malay> healthcare <malay>percuma</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk semua orang</malay>
<malay>sebab orang tua mungkin yang sudah kerja lama sudah mungkin sudah pencen ke</malay>
<malay>susah</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang nak</malay> afford <malay>untuk bayar dia orang punya</malay> hospital bills [kan]
<malay>nenek saya pun masuk</malay> hospital <malay>pun dah beberapa dah beberapa kali pasal sakit pasal jatuh</malay>
<malay>pun tak murah</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>nak bayar dia punya itu</malay>
my parents have to fork out some cash and my parent's siblings have to fork out some cash (um) just to be able to afford and you know help chip in
so in an ideal world if I could ask for one thing to be free I would say free healthcare for everybody regardless of who they are what their salaries status is
(mm) yes
(um) that's a good question something that I've thought about since I was a young kid as well I'm sure everybody has thought of it and been asked at some point if I could have one superpower it I guess I have to go with (um) the superpower of invisibility
and I think it would be pretty obvious why (um) I think it be pretty cool to be running around and nobody sees where or who you are
I can just board the plane and get past custom without anybody seeing me you know can travel anywhere I want
so ya I I think I'll be a pretty good criminal if I had the invisibility superpower you know it's just I think it'll be pretty fun to say the least
(um) obviously as of right now I don't think it's possible for anybody to be invisible so you know who knows maybe one day in the future <malay>kita boleh hilangkan diri</malay> [eh] in a way that
nobody can see us and obviously I hope for it to be
(um) temporary rather than permanent cause I still want to see my parents
I don't want to be invisible without them seeing me that'll be that'll be pretty bad I'd say what about you
I mean ya that's that sounds great to be honest (um) mind reading (um) I'm sure everybody has wanted to do it
<malay>kalau aku pun aku memang nak</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab macam dia kata kalau</malay> during exams <malay>kalau</malay> [lah] <malay>masa</malay> O level <malay>aku boleh baca minda orang</malay> [eh] <malay>yang duduk depan aku itu budak pandai itu kalau aku boleh baca minda dia mana tahu aku punya</malay> results <malay>lagi bagus daripada sekarang ke</malay>
(um)
ya <malay>betul-betul boleh baca minda kawan</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau dia tengah tipu ke kalau dia tengah jujur ke tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau orang ini berbual merepek ke</malay> you know I mean I guess mind reading is I'd say is pretty powerful to be honest but who knows maybe someday
we can have any planted tube inside our brain you know where we can access one another but I guess for my own personal reasons I wouldn't want people reading my mind you know
I'm sure you agree
(um) ya of course my next question to you is if you can instantly master three skills
what would be the three skills and why
[ah] ya before I say the three skills I master I (um) I agree with your last point about being able to
(um) be friends with everybody cause as an introvert
I often see myself having maybe a bit of trouble maybe a bit of shyness trying to
interact with the people around me although at the same time it makes me treasure
whatever friends I have now more than anything I have in the world
and right now the three skills that I'd master
<malay>yang pertama</malay> if <malay>kalau boleh aku nak</malay>
<malay>dapat cepat-cepat belajar apa-apa bahasa dalam dunia</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab pertama sekali</malay> (um) <malay>daripada kecil dulu pergi kelas madrasah selalu dapat dan sudah dapat belajar bahasa arab tapi sampai sekarang pun masih tak boleh</malay> (err) <malay>nak cakap satu ayat pun dalam bahasa arab sebab berapa susah nak belajar</malay>
so <malay>kalau ada peluang bahasa arab</malay>
<malay>bahasa perancis bahasa espanyol</malay>
<malay>bahasa</malay> german <malay>dengan</malay> italian
<malay>aku kalau boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau dapat</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cuba</malay>
(um) master [lah] <malay>dengan beberapa cepat</malay> [lah] <malay>yang kedua kalau boleh saya nak</malay>
(um) <malay>belajar masak dengan betul-betul baik</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> #faidil# <malay>kata tadi dia boleh</malay> look up to <malay>orang macam</malay> gordon ramsay <malay>yang memang hebat sekali bila masak tapi kalau saya saya tak</malay>
<malay>ikut</malay> [lah] gordon ramsay <malay>kalau boleh pun saya nak ikut emak saya sahaja sebab dia memang satu inspirasi bagi saya dan</malay>
<malay>kalau saya dah ada berumahtangga kalau ada bini ke saya tak nak bini saya tanggung semua tanggungjawab untuk masak untuk kita dan anak-anak kita</malay> so
<malay>mana tahu dua tiga minggu sekali saya boleh nak memasak untuk anak kita dan iya</malay> [lah] <malay>dapat senangkan untuk semua orang</malay>
the third skill that I would like to master is probably
(hmm)
I think I would say
being able to master just learning anything as quickly as possible and obviously it sounds more vague I mean I'd say anything cause obviously in life you will come across a lot of challenges and a lot of new experiences and
I think it would be great if I could just learn anything at hand just instantaneously cause
obviously I don't want to fall behind and you know let's say I enter the workforce and and (um) you know there's something new to be learned or something new to be
to be found out then I guess I would like to be able to learn it as quickly as possible
just for the for my own benefit
and moving on my next question to you is
do you watch and if so what genre of do you watch
from ya I mean ya actions sounds great (um) I I also want to ask you what what kind of movies or shows do you watch regarding that topic
maybe
dwayne the rock johnson maybe
(um) ya that I mean I mean I'm not personally I'm not a big fan of action myself I think I would rather access my emotions cause my favourite
genre of
or movies I'd say is definitely romance cause I'm a bit of a softie myself so I like to cry
some of my favourite shows or movies of romance I'd say for shows I would go with master of none starring #aziz ansari#
it's really great it really got me in my feelings
for movies there's a lot but I name my top three I'd say number three I would say maybe (um) five hundreds days of summer
starring (um) zoey deschanel number two maybe I'd say her starring joaquin phoenix and number one I'd say lala land starring emma stone and ryan gosling
movie romantic <malay>ini memang aku suka</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab aku ini suka nangis abeh tengok cerita-cerita macam gini</malay> I mean <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau kalau aku nangis</malay> [kan] <malay>memang dapat rasa emosi dia</malay> [lah] <malay>bila tengok orang berlakon</malay>
<malay>tapi macam drama-drama melayu pun banyak dekat</malay> <malay>tiga ke</malay> malaysia astro <malay>ke dapat tengok</malay>
<malay>kebanyakkan cerita romantis kelakar</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>memang aku suka</malay> [lah]
<malay>dengan</malay> (um) <malay>iya</malay> [lah] I mean other than romance I'd say I mean comedy would be my go to [ah]
obviously any movie starring the rock and kevin hart
those are absolute blockbuster movies and they always live up to their names
(um) ya and
regarding the questions about I'd say in this generation maybe is not quite the medium where we watch movies nowadays I think most of us would want to watch it on our phones
or maybe on a tablet where it's easier to access I mean obviously it's a shame to see dying out but
ya this is the new medium and most of us have already adjusted to it
I I agree I personally myself for romance movies I
my favourite movie itself indeed it's not the ending is not the cliche of
other like other romantic movies in fact the ending it's not cliche itself was the reason why I was crying so much cause it was so unexpected
so ya I mean it's hard to pick out something that is so good and and maybe a genre that is so saturated with just plain jane movies that we seen over and over again
and so now my next question to you is along the lines of and movies if you could become an actor or an actress who would it be
(um) ya johnny depp is indeed a fantastic actor who doesn't love pirates of the carribean right well personally I would say if I could become an actor I would
want to become ryan gosling
obviously cause he is in my favourite movie lala land acting with my favourite actress emma stone
so you know if I could take his place that will be pretty sweet and I mean the guy has acted in quite a lot of great movies like nice guys and and I guess his sense of humor and how he says it in a dead in a deadpan way
I kind of see his resemblance or my resemblance in him so ya I I like him
I mean I mean to be honest if one day I woke up as johnny depp (um) I won't be complaining to be honest but ya I guess johnny depp and ryan gosling personally really not
the same type of actor maybe
or maybe play the same type of movies
I mean you have your own opinions and I have my own taste [ah] so ya and to be honest I don't really care about who johnny depp dates to be honest
I I more of a fan of the movies that ryan plays so ya
I mean it'd be pretty sweet to wake up one day as a as a famous actor in hollywood
(um) my next question to you is
would you rather fight one
horse sized otter or one hundred otter sized horses personally I think I would rather fight just one horse sized otter cause
I think I don't think I can handle one hundred of something
and very small but you know it comes in pax so
I think I might get overwhelmed pretty quickly but
it's just a hypothetical and I just want to know what you think
thank you for agreeing with me and my next question to you is on the more sentimental a nostalgic note if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago what would have been inside that time capsule
<malay>kalau aku ada</malay> time capsule being the very nostalgic person I am
<malay>kalau sepuluh tahun aku baru sembilan tahun baru masih budak sekolah darjah lagi</malay>
<malay>kalau aku aku letak mungkin beberapa gambar</malay>
<malay>aku dengan ibu bapa aku bila aku kecil lagi</malay>
<malay>jadi aku boleh iya</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau sekarang buka aku boleh tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>gambar-gambar tersebut</malay> [kan]
and <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>fikir</malay> [lah] <malay>masa sebab dulu masa kita sepuluh sembilan sepuluh tahun tak banyak</malay> stress [kan] <malay>dalam hidup</malay>
<malay>kalau nak bandingkan dengan sekarang tak banyak risau tak tahu apa-apa</malay> about the world we don't know how bad the world is nowadays you know just think of yourself a more carefree time
if what else would I put inside I probably put in a few of my
xbox three sixty (um) console disc inside cause I have very fond memories of me playing games on my console when I got back from home
from primary school games like tiger woods tour maybe or maybe like
(um)
FIFA O nine or FIFA ten
where I would just everyday go home and play it carefreely
so
(um) ya [lah] (um)
just
I can't I can't really think of what else [lah] to put inside but
if I knew I'd agree with #faidil# as well
I would put in a note to myself I think it's like it's like what you said [lah] (um) I just
I just write to myself and
and just talk to myself about how life how great life was ten years ago
I I really wish I could go back in time [ah]
so ya that's what I would find inside my time capsule
do you have a question for me
okay sure I I will ask you the question (um) my next question is
if you had three wishes maybe for yourself for your family or you know you just for the whole world what will you wish for
that sounds like a pretty decent innovation
I I would definitely hope that
!whoa! <malay>memang menarik itu jawapan dia</malay>
I mean <malay>duit itu memang penting</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau aku aku pun nak duit</malay> [lah] <malay>seratus</malay> billion dollars <malay>itu memang</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>nak buat apa</malay> [eh] <malay>dah terlalu banyak sangat dah duit dia</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau aku ada tiga</malay>
wishes
<malay>yang pertama</malay>
(um) <malay>dalam keadaan dunia ini sekarang</malay>
<malay>aku akan</malay> wish <malay>untuk semua orang</malay>
<malay>dapat hidup dengan</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> stable [ah] <malay>sebab sekarang ini banyak orang hidup susah</malay>
<malay>dunia ini pun semakin</malay> (um) <malay>semakin mahal untuk tinggal dalam susah untuk keluarga untuk</malay> survive [kan]
so <malay>yang pertama</malay> I would wish for poverty to end cause
you live a cruel world and it's hard live without money so I just give an infinite amount of cash to
basically every single billion person in the world
you know just drop them a stack of cash so that they can
live a better life
my second wish would be (um) being the crazy football fan that I am I really wish I could own
chelsea football football club and cause I I really love football and I really love the club so it would be pretty cool to own the club [lah] cause I think that I can run the club better than its current owner and I think I have some pretty good ideas and on who to buy and
you know I can just give myself unlimited free tickets to watch the games so it's I think it's a pretty good package you know if I could ask for it and my third wish would be
(um) if I had a third wish I would just (um) in a cliche kind of answer I would wish for everybody to just have eternal happiness cause
it's hard to see your own friends or your own family be down sometimes
and even yourself so it's like it's
I mean obviously everybody goes through rough times but
it would be nice to see everybody live very happily (um) for until whenever
you know so ya that would be my three wishes I've heard yours
selfish
I mean ya (um) liverpool is a good club I I would like to argue with that but <malay>aku rasa</malay> chelsea <malay>itu memang aku dah lama</malay> [lah] <malay>sokong</malay> so <malay>aku aku tak akan tukar minda aku</malay>
<malay>aku memang aku memang</malay> jealous [lah] <malay>yang</malay> liverpool menang title <malay>tahun lepas</malay>
<malay>tapi aku aku rasa kalau aku</malay> control chelsea <malay>sendiri aku janji tiap-tiap tahun kita akan menang itu aku pastikan</malay> so <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau aku dah sokong itu memang aku tak akan tukar</malay> [lah] [eh]
and my next question to you is
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life
what would it be
(um) if I could have one dish for the rest of my life
<malay>aku akan pilih</malay>
<malay>aku punya</malay>
<malay>masakan ibu</malay>
<malay>kegemaran</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>nasi</malay>
[eh] <malay>nasi pula lauk lemak</malay>
<malay>cili padi</malay>
<malay>sebab daripada dulu mak aku masak memanglah sedap gila</malay>
and <malay>aku</malay> and I really like it and I do not know how to make it so
I mean I I take it as my meal for the rest of my life but
ya
I think
it's more of a sentimental dish rather than a dish of
you know something more extravagent like you know maybe a steak
maybe #wagyu# beef maybe
but no I would think my own mum's dish
is it a job that like any job I can choose
I would choose
I would take two jobs one job I would want to become an actor
in hollywood cause that's something that I always wanted to do
cause there's a lot of people I admire in the industry
(um)
<malay>yang kedua</malay>
<malay>kalau kalau boleh</malay> I want to become a journalist cause
I really like the work that they do and you know how they always (um)
the first people when the news breaks so
the first people to report on something new happens
I feel like the thrill of the job
is something that I can never get bored of
(um) (um)
there's always something satisfactory that I can look forward everyday
what about you
(um) !wow! (um) those three jobs sound great
and you know I will move on to the next question now
the next question is
good looks or a fake body
what would you prefer
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>memang</malay>
<malay>memang sekarang ini banyak orang</malay>
<malay>betul betul betul betul</malay> judgemental [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay>
so <malay>kalau aku boleh pilih</malay>
<malay>kalau jujur cakap aku nak pilih badan yang sihat</malay> [lah]
<malay>daripada muka yang</malay> handsome [lah]
<malay>sebab sebagai seorang yang tak ada dua-dua</malay>
<malay>kalau aku boleh tukar aku punya rupa sekarang juga</malay>
<malay>aku akan pilih badan yang lebih sihat</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab lebih susah untuk nak turunkan berat badan daripada</malay>
<malay>nak cuba yang terbaik untuk</malay>
<malay>nampak lebih</malay>
<malay>lebih baik</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk orang lain</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi akhirnya juga</malay>
<malay>kalau orang itu badan dia memang bagus ke muka dia betul-betul</malay> handsome <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>atau kalau tak pun</malay>
<malay>saya rasa yang kita setuju yang</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> that personality is in someone is more important right like for us as a guy
I think would say that
a girl's personality is number one right
that's that's just what I think [lah] obviously everybody has their own preferences but if
I think if given a choice I would give a girl I would get a girl with a banging personality
over someone with a face like a a ten [lah] what about you
(um) ya of course personality is always number one
and obviously we cannot judge a person by what they look like judge a book by its cover you know
so ya
(um) !wow! (um) first of all
I
that is a surprising statistic personally
(um) I just why <malay>aku rasa hidup dekat singapura ini sebagai seorang remaja memang</malay>
<malay>memang laju</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk senang kata</malay> [lah] <malay>memang laju memang banyak</malay> stress <malay>banyak yang nak buat</malay>
<malay>dan ini baru sebelum orang masuk kerja ini belum lagi masuk kerja akan dapat lebih</malay> stress
<malay>dan saya rasa</malay>
<malay>ini lebih kepada</malay>
culture <malay>di pada negara-negara di asia</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab iya</malay> [lah] <malay>benda macam</malay> (um) <malay>kesihatan</malay> mental <malay>ini memang</malay>
<malay>bagi keluarga melayu ke dekat asia ini memang tak diambil berat</malay> [lah]
<malay>untuk ibu bapa</malay> [kan] <malay>sebab cara mereka dengan cara kita</malay> [kan] <malay>tak sama mereka datang daripada zaman yang mungkin lebih susah</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi mungkin mereka tak anggapkan kesihatan</malay> mental <malay>sebagai sesuatu yang penting</malay> [lah]
and and I just think that maybe it's maybe it's a taboo for them to talk about it and maybe they are not as open to it as us and obviously suicide is just
is is a is a horrible way to end someone's their their own life and I I hope that anybody who goes through maybe a a depressive phase you know you know troubled times I really hope that they
would seek (um) a therapist or someone who is an expert to to help them cause it's it's always sad when you know someone who's taken their lives or just
<malay>macam dekat dalam berita yang ada orang bunuh diri dan</malay>
you wish you could have helped to avoid it but <malay>tak boleh</malay> so
it's just a waste of a life [ah] and what's your thoughts
(um) ya for sure (um) I feel like
(um) the awareness itself about mental health is very important (um) obviously in the past few years I think it's been way better now nowadays and as someone who knows somebody else who's who has anxiety who who has gone through depressive phase and knows about it I know about them I I myself am guilty of disregarding their feelings and just telling them to you know
get on with it you know and I as having been there and done that obviously I am very guilty and I feel bad about them cause cause and thankfully obviously they did not they did not end their own lives cause you know they manage to seek help but I guess I guess everybody
<malay>yang</malay> one way or another has been at fault
why you know has has been there when it comes to disregarding someone's else feelings and I think it's something that as a community I think we all can improve on
how about you #faidil#
[oh] should should I go first ya (um) first of all I'd say there's a lot that I am thankful for to be born in singapore (um) first of all
I'm very thankful that my parents have been able to live a stable life being here (um) I myself have been able to been raised up in a good community in a good place living in a block
(um) when I think about the past twenty years living in singapore I'm very I'm very thankful and <malay>memang bersyukurlah dapat pergi sekolah belajar daripada</malay> kindergarten <malay>sampai sekarang dekat sekolah</malay> poly <malay>ambil</malay> diploma
(um) <malay>dapat buat dengan senang tak ada tak ada</malay> bill <malay>yang mahal-mahal yang kita kena bayar macam orang yang datang dari luar negara</malay> (um) <malay>dekat sini pun</malay> (um) healthcare <malay>macam dekat</malay> polyclinic <malay>ke dekat</malay> hospital <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>kita punya apa dia kita punya</malay> government <malay>kita dapat tolong dapat</malay> cover [kan] <malay>dapat bantu</malay> and <malay>ada</malay> (um) as someone who has two siblings with special needs
and (um) and seeing what my parents have to work for just to be able to afford to send them to school to send them for their hospital meetings all and seeing the cost of it itself I'm very thankful that the government helps to cover and
I know my dad has never said it but I'm quite sure he is very thankful as well
and I I just hope that
me and the people around me will be able to work hard and just live a stable life in singapore
how about you #faidil#
(um) I also like to give a shoutout to all the nurses who work during the COVID (um) period we are also very thankful that they putting the hours everyday cause it's been a it's been crazy times for singapore for the whole world and it just I like to give my appreciation I'm sure my friend #faidil# feels the same way and with that I #faidil# thank you for talking to me today I'm sure we talk about a lot of stuff a lot of different stuff today did you have a good time
