or less than two hours <malay>dah habis</malay> [ah] edit
(uh) <malay>tadi</malay> I <malay>berbual dengan</malay> my
my russian teacher <malay>tu</malay> the skype over skype [eh]
he would we were still talking about music cause last week we were talking about music so he ask me he was (err) he was a having a conversation with his friends our (uh) what some he has some friends from thailand so he told me <malay>yang</malay>
there's this lady a friend lady of his who was sharing a video she was singing a song
I and the song was from #tokyo# square then she's like #tokyo# square so he thought that <malay>dia dari jepun ke</malay> group <malay>ni</malay> then I at the moment he said that my eyes lit up I said yes he and I think he knows that singaporean [lah] it's a singaporean group he did a study but he he actually he did a research and he found out that the group was a singaporean group but the song that he quoted that he liked was (uh)
(err) who I don't remember the title keep on loving you or something like that
then I it's like [eh] that's not the famous song from #tokyo# square
but the song actually nice <malay>tapi dia pakai lagu</malay> #sukiyaki# <malay>punya lagu</malay> [tau] do you know #sukiyaki# right there's this
it's all because of you you know that song
I'm feeling sad and blue so they use that melody but the #tokyo# square turned it into a song I think using the lyrics they sing it [ah]
(uh) it's not an original so I told him that when I was young I follow <malay>kak tina</malay> to this concert by #tokyo# square
so #tokyo# square actually that
it's not a a got a #tokyo# square concert but they perform a few songs [ah]
(uh) because there are many other things that (err) at that show so #tokyo# square was one of them so I I I remember #tokyo# square but the song that that was famous I was telling victor the word #tokyo# slot square is famous for this song called within you I remain is it within you remain or something like that
(uh) that is the originally is from #tokyo# square but there's some (uh) famous <malay>mat salleh</malay> singers sing that song [lah] western singers that (err) sing (err) #tokyo# square <malay>punya lagu</malay> but that is I say <malay>macam</malay> singapore okay comparatively to russia over to
to america right they don't have
a lot of talent [lah] they don't <malay>macam</malay> you know
it's not like it's but this this is like one of the few ones that many people
will remember because you know they would want he went there
no because he liked the melody and he and I said the melody is actually from a japanese song very very I think is #sukiyaki# [ah] from what I know
(uh) but <malay>dia punya</malay> melody has been reused and reused by other bands [lah] but that is not the most famous #tokyo# square
(uh) because like I mean <malay>nama</malay> #tokyo# square <malay>tapi dari</malay> singapore you know <malay>macam</malay>
that's the that's the unique thing [lah] that he was like
have you heard the song within you I remain ai ni</mandarin> I love you
it's very famous ai ni</mandarin> I need you
because my I think <malay>kak tina</malay> did some events [ah] for local music group in the eighties so when she also babysit us so she
put us somewhere then she brought me with her [lah] so I think one of that that's why she know #tokyo# square
(uh)
and that they were performing <malay>dekat mana</malay> [tau] <malay>kat depan</malay> if I am not wrong [eh] at this <malay>padang</malay> area near parkway parade
they had this show they had this
no <malay>macam</malay> this area <malay>dekat depan</malay> parkway <malay>ke sebelah kat</malay> parkway <malay>ke</malay> one of those area [lah] because parkway was you it was like a famous [lah] you can see shopping shopping mall shopping center <malay>dekat</malay> eighties nineties <malay>mana ada banyak</malay>
[ah] so you remember [lah]
(mm)
(uh) the open space then they put up (err) the stage right [eh] (um) but you like some of the local music scene right it's like some of the songs right
there were some songs that you like [what]
(uh)
sam willows
I think <malay>kalau mungkin mungkin yang</malay> singapore <malay>yang</malay> rock band [lah] <malay>yang dulu-dulu</malay> [ah]
[ah] the malay rock band #ramli sarip# all that there is known <malay>tapi</malay> for the english
medium [eh] english medium <malay>tak banyak</malay> that's why #tokyo# squares is one of <malay>tapi yang</malay> you <malay>kata</malay> sam willows <malay>sekarang</malay> famous there were a few [ah]
(uh)
is there a song baby jane [eh]
(uh)
four

ya because they're singaporean like like
the the drama series actors compared to the chinese (err) medium right like the malay medium
(err) have this problem even english medium you know where they're not professionals now the amateurs right they have a real professional job at the side
at at a real professional job and they do singing or they do acting
(uh) on the side line [lah] it's like the a full time job for them

he was able to
like they say <malay>kembangkan dia punya</malay> talent [ah]
we're going to malaysia because he did so many
he did so many wonderful songs I mean I cannot imagine
like a lot of the a lot of the songs like that if he did was famous [what]
ya
[ah] ya the malay medium [lah] but it's like some of the
singapore hong-kong talent that went into chinese medium also like #kit chan#
you know <malay>macam yang ada</malay> english the (err) english medium <malay>ada</malay> but they are not
they are not world famous [lah] <malay>macam</malay> the their world famous because they perform

astro [eh]
I don't otherwise director of astro guy so a lot of the malay talent they
he brought he brought over singapore malay talent bring over to malaysia
so they have this (err)
[ah] not really talent train [lah] it's just that they give opportunities for them because there's a market <malay>macam kira</malay> malaysia <malay>ada</malay> market you know
<malay>macam nak cakap pasal</malay> comedian <malay>ni semua macam kita hantar kita hantar</malay> comedian <malay>pun</malay> comedian <malay>macam</malay> (err) #suhaimi# [eh] #suhaimi# part time you know at least <malay>dia dia</malay> part time mostly full time you know so he doesn't really get to hone his comedic skills that I know
<malay>jadi macam</malay>

singapore the the [ah] they're not very good with improvisation <malay>tak bagus</malay>
[ah] I I I understand <malay>macam boboi boboi punya</malay> jokes [eh] #boboi# the group the maharaja lawak</malay> [eh] [kan] they have #boboi# they have the different
[ah] what is that either let like either when they talk about <malay>loghat</malay> [eh] there's always a <malay>tema tema</malay> like like <malay>loghat</malay> like is always going to be malaysia <malay>menang</malay> because singapore <malay>tak pandai buat loghat</malay> you know
it's only people like [ah] #zizan# #zizan# [eh]
they can really do <malay>loghat</malay> know and they really are very good at imitating <malay>macam</malay> singapore <malay>punya macam</malay> they are not that fluid their ability not that fluid
you know <malay>macam</malay> malaysia really <malay>bercakap loghat loghat</malay> is accent right <malay>kira loghat orang</malay> #kedah# <malay>orang</malay> #kelantan# and then
they are more exposure ya
<malay>kita punya loghat</malay> is <malay>loghat bahasa baku</malay>
no no but they are very professional I remember I <malay>pergi</malay> (err) the not <malay>kedung kodek</malay> what's that
the theater [lah] that the malaysia that we went to to watch the #nadrah# right
the maria hertogh riots thing right so the I remember I was watching <malay>pi mai pi mai tang tu</malay> at that time was #imuda# #imuda# that there were some people <malay>sayang</malay> they can perform on stage four to five hours I mean it was a three hour show three hour plus show with interval almost four hours they can really they have really showmanship they are really professionals you know
because they can really perform !ee! <malay>apa tu</malay> they can really perform <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>buat masa yang berpanjangan</malay> [tau] <malay>macam ada</malay> stamina is really that <malay>atau buat orang macam orang pergi</malay> #kelantan# #kelantan# they they the people doing <malay>dikir barat</malay>
they can really do <malay>dikir barat</malay> the whole night you know because that is like their training you know
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> for us it's not like that at all that's why I say it's amateurs [lah]
I remember when M #nasir# was talking to a
(err) #hady# [eh] #hady mirza#
for the
(err) what's the talent show [eh]
the <malay>yang yang lama-lama</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia kata orang</malay> glamour <malay>ada</malay> what is that [ah]
that's the not singapore idol the one ya they go to malaysia <malay>dia</malay> perform astro <malay>punya</malay> [lah]
I think astro <malay>punya</malay> organise so ya guest judge was
(err) M #nasir# so (err) #hady mirza# because I also don't have astro but I watch on youtube [lah] I I I I watched through
[ah] <malay>tapi dia ada</malay> all the the veteran singer so #hady# was face off with this other
they need to create that rivalry I think on purpose [lah]
[ah] so they have this person in the end <malay>dia menang dua-dua</malay> two of them <malay>memang</malay> [kan]
it's a draw ya
so ya it was
quite I think (err) (err) M #nasir# asked him (err) #hady# where have you been
why now you know <malay>macam</malay> like in a way <malay>kenapa sekarang kenapa tak dari dulu lagi kau datang kat</malay> malaysia you know
because he was (err) wondering what he wasn't he was straying away from
for work (err)
ya <malay>pasal dia dah</malay> then he wanted to stop then he went off drugs right then he he he decided that okay this is really <malay>menyanyi</malay> is really his talent you know
is he forgotten ya
ya
ya that is the problem [eh]
no but <malay>macam</malay> I remember when I was watching those chinese drama series [eh]
like zoe #tay# and that time zoe #tay# was the were the in she was really the talent like #pan ling ling#
junior [eh] #yuan ching# you <malay>tahu</malay> you <malay>kenal dia</malay> was she some
ya zoe #tay# was from your <malay>ni</malay>
#yuan ching# #yuan ching# <malay>yang dekat</malay> #jurong# [eh]
[oh]
her association
no but but you had that #yuan ching# <malay>punya</malay> alumni #yuan ching# <malay>punya</malay> alumni is it #yuan ching#
#yuan ching# <malay>macam hancing</malay> the the #yuan ching# <malay>punya</malay> alumni dinner right you [eh]
no I said if you want to go you can go with
<malay>siapa tu</malay>
(err) your friends <malay>apa ashik</malay> [eh] <malay>siapa</malay>
#amin# [kan] <malay>dia orang tak pergi</malay> [eh]
I told you the three of you form a table [what] with your other friends and <malay>sama kelas</malay>
no at that time [lah]
now <malay>memang susah</malay>
[ah]
pass away already [eh]
pass away [eh]
retired [lah]
<malay>cikgu ahmad said macam pernah dengar</malay> [jer]
how does it look like
is it <malay>badan besar rambut putih</malay> [eh]
[oh]
pointed out [ah]
as in he's still
actually I feel kind of sad that my teachers are retiring I don't know for some reason why
I just
ya <malay>macam macam macam seroja</malay> was telling me she was retiring from right I feel so sad you know
or or even when peter bush was saying I felt so sad cause I was like what I felt that they could go on and on no forever and then retiring make me feel sad I don't know for some reason it just makes me sad
you know
ya
they say they are no longer they are no longer
you know but I thought that they will be like okay like for example I thought peter bush would want to be a professor you know you want to climb the
you know to be ya I mean be (err) get get new more books you know but <malay>macam</malay> the way he said like they said well you know like the wood that's it for me man and it's just <malay>macam seroja</malay>
she's just tired you know
and (um)
I think that's the main reason why they retire
[eh] even at that time they were complaining about the millennials right
they both of them have the same complaint
the millennials are so
no we're not we are not we are post millennial we are not millennial
millennial until thirty nine [oh] for you you are millennial I'm not [sia]
you you are I'm not I'm older than you <malay>sayang</malay>
I'm a nineteen seventy nine
(uh) I am a generation X [leh]
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>si si siapa</malay> was telling me these millennials [ah] because it's
it's really the you [lah] but you are not the the the the people that #seroja# and #borshak# was saying [lah]
the they were saying that this millennials [ah] lazy you know lazy [ah]
ya
ya but for people to retire they should have money right all that right <malay>mana tengok seroja</malay> I <malay>tengok kesian</malay> [ah]
[ah]
because I think more than half of her salary she was putting away for the house
<malay>dia beli rumah tu</malay> about <malay>satu</malay> point <malay>satu satu</malay> point <malay>dua juta</malay> [tau]
no she said people the
you know the the the my russian course mate that that wanted to (uh) buy a house right that one right she told me that she wanted to sell her house <malay>pun</malay> (err)
(uh) it's slow down <malay>macam orang pun tak nak beli</malay>
so
<malay>rumah dia kata rumah dia sepuluh tahun dia beli rumah tu</malay> I think
I think ten years [eh] twelve years or fifteen years ago
and she said she cannot even (err) make any profit
(err) around the same price as #seroja#
(uh) (uh)
(uh) <malay>dia pun nak jual dia tak nak jual</malay>
<malay>dia tak nak jual</malay>
(uh)
<malay>macam tinggi</malay> [lah] <malay>tak nak jual harga tinggi</malay> [lah] she just want to sell (uh)
slightly more [lah] or around the same price [lah]
because she already bought a she already got (err) her flat
(err) her not her flat her condo at amber at amber road
<malay>dia punya rumah yang ini tingkat dua yang rumah ke sana tu tingkat lapan</malay>
she want to because she love (err) cycling
[ah] and then she will she loved to cycle at east coast so it to her it doesn't make sense to cycle <malay>dekat</malay>
her condo <malay>tu</malay> [kan] not near the beach right so <malay>macam</malay>
to her is an effort [lah] to go back and forth <malay>naik basikal di situ</malay> and I think a bit #ulu# [lah] because <malay>situ</malay> [kan] <malay>jauh</malay> [kan]
she like cycling but <malay>macam</malay>
I think she wants to cycle near the beach [lah] she doesn't have to
(uh)
ya [lah] but she has wonderful legs [ah]
she looks amazing for her age and then she also does ballroom dancing so it's very interesting but <malay>macam</malay>
for me when I see her I <malay>tengok</malay> I don't think money is a problem of course she like to
<malay>macam</malay> is typical of (err) they're people from their group right they like to think about money they like to make more money but I think for her to be able to
<malay>macam</malay> still <malay>tinggal</malay> that <malay>rumah walaupun rumah tu belum jual</malay> and still have (err) her she's start to pay ready for her house
in amber road
started paying already so she doesn't need there's no hurry
I think around (uh) ten years or so [ah]
no she was the first owner
you mean the amber road or the one at
the amber road [eh]
the amber road I'm not sure maybe [ah]
I think I I don't think is a new condo [ah]
(uh) (uh)
no no hers was second hers was a new <malay>lepas tu dia kata</malay> <malay>ada</malay>
(uh) it's new it's new
[ah] <malay>tapi besar</malay> because <malay>rumah dia belum habis</malay> renovate [eh] because they had to for stall the
(uh)
(uh) the no the the <malay>macam kira</malay> development <malay>dah habis semua tapi orang semua</malay> I think they <malay>nak</malay> renovate [ah] <malay>sikit-sikit</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi pasal</malay> renovation <malay>kena</malay> put on hold because of the COVID
she cannot move in
she still have to stay
so I was thinking to myself [oh] not bad [eh] <malay>dia tak payah jual rumah</malay> in order to live in that place you know
because most people they have to <malay>jual rumah</malay> so <malay>maknanya dia ada duit juta-juta</malay> I mean she's already <malay>nak dekat enam puluh lebih dah enam puluh nak dekat enam puluh lebih gitu</malay> and therefore someone like her not having to sell the place
and not having to borrow money from the bank
maybe she has the money <malay>ada duit juga</malay> [ah]
that one <malay>betul-betul ada</malay> (err) pool or view of the pool ya
it's a very sexy you know what the view that because you can see the pool when you enter her her living space
when you enter her living room and then when you go her bedroom directly in front of the the pool in the centre of the pool
<malay>tiga tiga</malay> bedroom
she say three bedroom but I only went to her bedroom because her bedroom ya is the one that opens directly to in front of the very nice <malay>sayang</malay> it was like
[oh] my god sex heaven
(uh) I think I think for <malay>dasha dia terperanjat tapi dasha memang tinggal</malay> condo she shared with a flatmates <malay>dulu dia tinggal dekat</malay> <malay>sekarang dia tinggal kat</malay> condo I think she found a new flatmate [eh] and then <malay>macam kat kat</malay> russia [kan] they don't have this quality of
condo [kan]
(uh) so it's a bit you know she's also quite aware [lah] about the development about about buying condo (uh) that #dasha# is aware so <malay>macam macam</malay> it's very sexy [lah]
it's very very nice
no I think she stay I think she stay at condo because <malay>dekat itu dekat dengan</malay> russian <malay>nya</malay> embassy
and and then <malay>dekat</malay> #bukit timah# <malay>dia nak dekat dengan</malay> nature <malay>agaknya orang putih gitu</malay> [kan]
[ah] shared <malay>dengan ramai ramai ramai</malay>
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I never ask
(uh)
because I thought I I thought she stayed at #serangoon# garden then then suddenly she went over so that one I don't know that story I don't know
(uh) (uh)
(uh) but I think she like the location <malay>agaknya</malay>
<malay>dekat dengan rumah dekat dengan dekat kerja agaknya</malay>
(uh) because this <malay>mat salleh</malay> they like their nature they like
(uh) <malay>dia naik</malay> bus <malay>dia dia orang naik</malay> bus
I don't know I think she definitely made a choice
because maybe the flatmate <malay>yang dia suka yang sekufu dengan dia agaknya</malay>
!huh!
I don't think it's sponsored
but I can ask [lah]
but it's like I think for europeans is not really
they're not really <malay>macam kita</malay> a bit rude about money we talk about money like <malay>macam</malay> I can ask audrey and she doesn't feel offended but if I ask the question to audrey I think #dasha# will be uncomfortable
because it's not something that europeans like to talk about <malay>macam</malay>
especially french so I think it's something that they
<malay>macam</malay> it's not really the thing [lah] <malay>macam</malay> us <malay>cakap berapa kau beli berapa kau jual</malay>
(uh)
I mean I can't ask that question
but
but she's very (err) thrifty [lah] [sia]
you <malay>tahu</malay> this this year I don't see her spending anything <malay>dia tak beli baju baru</malay>
rent [eh]
(uh)
I think it's two or three of them I think it's two of them in the room
ya
(mm)
<malay>mungkin dengan</malay> boyfriend <malay>dia ke apa kita tak tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>mungkin ada</malay> boyfriend [lah]
that's why she move (uh)
<malay>kalau</malay> like that okay [eh]
make sense right
(uh) but #sami# <malay>suka</malay>
I know chile said she say she live in a condo because she said that she had her pool is always in front there but she never used so there's to me it's fixed condo [lah]
(uh)
<malay>macam dia dia kata dia ada</malay> swimming pool <malay>kat depan rumah dia tapi tak pernah guna</malay> [kan] (uh) that's fixed to me condo [lah]
(uh)
<malay>macam</malay> some of the <malay>aminah punya</malay> friends right they <malay>tinggal</malay> condo [ah]
(uh)
so they are a bit different [lah] their their the way they
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> (err) I guess that's <malay>macam</malay> we have friends in I remember I have friends in
I mean we are just three room four room dweller but that this fence <malay>pula tinggal rumah sebuah tiga tingkat</malay> they're they're thinking already and the way they speak already different
their upbringing is different right
(uh) distinction [lah] (uh)
ya
they don't from what I observed right they don't necessary have the best grades I remember when I was in school
I mean
<malay>yang pak ali</malay> [eh] you know <malay>pak ali</malay> always get the best grades <malay>macam</malay> dean's lists [lah] #borhan# also the one the radio <malay>warna</malay> right but they were from it doesn't
<malay>macam</malay> ya people used to think that (err)
having coming from a middle class or upper middle class
will give you a distinct advantage yes but not necessary so [lah]
(uh)
they do have the advantage but you know ya resources but they not necessarily the best [lah] the best usually not them [lah]
(uh) I I mean I remember I had this german coursemate near terrace [eh]
she he ya
ya
he was educated <malay>sayang</malay> he was educated when he was young he was educated in #eton# [tau]
he went to #eton# know that was his socialization [tau]

but he's very nice [lah] I think the reason why he wants me to be the partner is because his german is better than mine he doesn't want a partner that is much better than him of course you know so every time <malay>kita</malay> because when you have a partner you have to have a conversation and your teacher have to observe you <malay>berbual</malay> and then <malay>dia dia dia punya orang tidak apa punya orang</malay> so most of the time we speak <malay>melayu</malay> and <malay>baba</malay> so

I cannot go to germany but when he went to germany and he asked me what do you want me to buy for you so I I ask him [oh] can you get for me this this this this you know like the like from the then he will get for me [lah] of course [lah] he won't pay for it [lah] but because it's my <malay>mahal</malay> right so I pay for it but it doesn't matter
but it is like you order it it will be more expensive so he went over there <malay>dia beli dia ingat</malay> I don't know how it is now terrence

but he's a very fluent russian speaker
so he teach the #eton# boys (err) russian [lah]
#eton# is like the boarding school
in in there's a boarding school
no no no <malay>dia nak pergi</malay> actually <malay>tak nak pergi</malay> singapore

she wanna do psychology from what I heard she wanna do psychology <malay>siapa si</malay>
soci is hard to get it also
you have to do aptitude test [leh]

<malay>ustazah yang</malay> teacher that the
class no that the degree that they have like for example <malay>yang daripada</malay>
(err) university of
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
jordan and the university of
not cairo [lah] (err) #al-azhar#
#al-azhar#
#al-azhar#
(uh) it's not they say it's not a degree level you know
it's not considered a degree level <malay>macam</malay> for example you want to be a teacher right
they don't consider a degree for #al-azhar# a degree
yes that's what my <malay>ustaz</malay> told me
so <malay>macam</malay> it has to be like they recognize degree
(uh)
don't know #allahu aalam#
jordan I <malay>tak tahu</malay>
(uh)
(uh)
could be [ah] because <malay>mak dia mak dia tak nak</malay> but but but (uh) the <malay>ustaz kata</malay> that's the reason <malay>macam</malay> for example <malay>kita dapat</malay> second upper the second upper (uh) or first class you got your pay scale it they are not even considered degree
ya
ya that's why like people say why they go to <malay>madrasah</malay> for that's the big question everybody ask
<malay>siapa</malay>
(uh) #wani# [eh]
<malay>agaknya</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay>
I don't know now (err) COVID I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
unless they do online [lah] unless they do online [lah] but I don't know #al-azhar# now not that good [lah]
so that's why a lot of people recommend <malay>pergi</malay> jordan
there's <malay>dia orang punya</malay>
the system of learning [ah]
(err) I think ever since the the egyptian spring [ah] uprising ya arab spring
you know syria attack but syria always so they will always be the attack are you know right until the end of time [lah] we know that the story [lah]
[oh] now she didn't go with them she went to the jordanian embassy right
[kan] <malay>itu hari si</malay> king of jordan <malay>datang</malay>
and then she got a rolex watch she was showing it off at the facebook
I don't I don't see her posting anymore because usually she like to post about those people who come from afar cause her part is medical she's actually in the medical tourism line where she does translator she does translation for people from middle east like which I think she know five dialect a few from eygptian like <malay>tiga empat daripada</malay> eygpt and then she knows other dialect [lah] so <malay>dia kata ada kesian</malay> because she was telling me because <malay>dia kenal-kenal dengan ustaz</malay>
<malay>ustaz hasan</malay> so <malay>dia bilang</malay> [ah] <malay>dia bilang dengan</malay> I [lah] some of them come from <malay>negeri yang</malay> you know they come from <malay>kampung</malay> so only know dialect [tau] <malay>dia orang tak tahu</malay> so they don't even know so she try to bend here bend [ah]
nothing from this this girl this lady you know
and this lady have a condition [ah] <malay>dia kata</malay> then I ask (err) your cousin [eh] how do you translate all those medical term to that because she needs to know what she's getting herself into [eh] [a'ah] <malay>kak tini bukan senang</malay> you know like <malay>nak kena ni nak kena</malay> surgery <malay>nak kena ni</malay> can you imagine <malay>nak kena</malay> like you have to a bypass and how to you have to talk about the heart all that I said if you need to talk in a dialect how
she sometime <malay>tunjuk gambar tunjuk gambar gini cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti orang tu boleh faham dia kata</malay> and then the sad thing the sad thing is the embassy spend thousand of dollars on these people <malay>agaknya derma</malay> I think embassy <malay>derma agaknya</malay> and then spend money on them you know (err) spend the money on translations (err) these translators
[oh] ya because the the king would (err) #hussein# not #hussein# I I I <malay>kenal bini dia</malay> (uh) he was very impressed the singapore side very <malay>cepat</malay> very efficient
but when I was telling doctor <malay>ustaz hasan ustaz hasan apa dia</malay> showing off
can just give to the poor people but I think for him is like a simple gesture
to everybody who work for the embassy on the singapore side
(uh) that is the rumour [lah] that she <malay>tunjuk</malay> the <malay>jam</malay>
(uh) but at that time this is before the trace translator for the hospital this is after that so when after that
she decided to because this one did the sponsorship for the translator need to come from somewhere right so after that there's no funds for them right then she and then she move on to she move on to or she got another job
(err) at the
(uh)
(err) visa at the jordianian embassy [ah]
ya but it's also something that has strength [lah] because her #fusha# is very good like the <malay>orang arab dengar</malay> #fusha# [lah] <malay>yang</malay> I try to <malay>berbual dengan ustazah hadijah</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> #fusha# but okay so <malay>macam</malay> the the difficult dialect is not egyptian [lah] according to them [lah] but I don't know I <malay>tengok</malay> egypt in dialect very different because people say egypt <malay>punya</malay> dialect very near #fusha# the standard model standard arabic but if it drove many people don't speak more than studied arabic everyday
modern standard arabic it's a very formal language
that comes off from the quran [lah] you know it's like
you know but the thing is if it true people speak their dialect so the the what the dialect all the dialect they are a bit different from the #fusha#
<malay>banyak orang arab banyak</malay> [kan] very diverse
that's the that's the thing [lah] so they get whatever they can
<malay>dia tinggal kat</malay> egypt <malay>itu dia tinggal mesir dah berapa lama</malay> she even take she even take #talaqqi# courses at the the famous egyptian scholars when she was there she told me
also she taught she take #talaqqi# she taught she taught me how to <malay>tajwid</malay>
she told me <malay>yang</malay> the and then when I ask #abi# #abi# say <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>ada yang ustaz yang</malay> famous <malay>sampai boleh kalau</malay> you <malay>buat salah</malay> your <malay>bacaan sampai boleh ambil</malay> you know your you know the what is that thing [ah]
when they collect the smoke the cigarette <malay>punya</malay> ashes [leh]
(uh) they can throw that at your face
like <malay>garang</malay> [ah]
you know but that is the the the nature [lah] but then you want to get the #sadat# [eh] they call it #sadat# you you want to get #sadat# so you do that [lah]
let her just stay here [lah] let her she said if her strength is science then let her go to science let her go to poly like her
let her <malay>bukan</malay> poly <malay>tak boleh pakai tudung pakai</malay> [jer] <malay>tudung kat</malay> poly
(uh)
or you want her to go okay [lah] go <malay>pakai</malay> then there's the other thing [lah]
I think (err) <malay>tengok</malay> appetite <malay>dia macam</malay> math and science
language is a bit hard [lah]
but she might she might change her mind because I wasn't very good either my language isn't very good either
we're looking better and better when I was you know
(uh)
I think from what I know in singapore
you do very well if you do science says at your computing you know you do very well
languages not really our core strength [ah]
in singapore you cannot do well <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I don't think so [lah]
(uh) I mean I have friends who who like for example #murni# and I have a mutual friend
(err) <malay>namanya</malay>
(err) okay [lah] one of our girlfriends [lah]
so I'm not that close to her [lah] because
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] I just <malay>tak cam tak ngam dengan dia sangat</malay> [lah] but she's very close to #murni# so now she's the
<malay>punya</malay> translation unit she she's the head you know
I mean I don't have to worry about it until
<malay>pasal</malay> I <malay>selalu berbual dengan dia</malay>
then I made her watch asian <malay>alida bahasa melayu</malay> I even I even (err)
