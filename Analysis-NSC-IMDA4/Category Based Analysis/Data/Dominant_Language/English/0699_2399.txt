[ah] alright okay so
<malay>semalam aku</malay> try <malay>main</malay> twenty then (uh) it's not as easy and seamless as I thought it would be [sia]
you know how we started on sixteen
then after that
[ah] it was very
simple the flow was simple and everything right
starting then you straightaway <malay>cam dia kasi kau</malay> options <malay>nak buat macam mana abeh nak kena buat tu nak kena buat ni</malay> so everything was <malay>macam</malay> flow after flow after flow after flow okay
<malay>semalam aku</malay> try <malay>main</malay> it's not like that [sia]
so [ah] <malay>apa tu kau dah</malay> create everything <malay>semua</malay> once <malay>kau dah</malay> start the game yet and everything and whatnot [kan]
so they will bring you through a phase where you have to go for a club interview
okay
and then there are more trainings and delegations of jobs that you have to do
so (uh)
<malay>apa tu</malay> positional positional training tactics [kan] they give you multiples multiple <malay>apa tu</malay>
set of tactics to use and #gegenpress# #tiki-taka# all all pre-default
okay but then
tactic <malay>kau pilih sendiri</malay>
so formation <malay>apa kau nak pakai kau pilih sendiri</malay>
(mm) so there's more tactical freedom [lah] in that sense
no that that is still [lah] <malay>macam</malay> they give you pre-default (uh)
pre-default four four two four two three four five one whatever [lah] so there's a lot of different different different types of tactics to choose and play with but then [ah]
<malay>apa</malay> style <malay>kau nak main</malay> in that game for your players to play [kan]
can depend [lah] so let's say this game <malay>kau main</malay> #tiki-taka# four three one
four two three one
then the next game <malay>kau nak main</malay> #gegenpress# four two three one <malay>pun boleh</malay>
so there is no restrictions on that however
[kan]
(uh)
<malay>yang</malay> #gegenpress# #tiki-taka# is a style of player formation is formation so these two must interlink <malay>kalau</malay> these two <malay>tak</malay> interlink
<malay>kau nya</malay> formation <malay>tak leh</malay> work
(mm)
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi kalau kau buat gitu</malay>
it also depends on <malay>kau punya</malay> team <malay>punya apa tu</malay> familiarity of the tactics [ah]
<malay>ada ada</malay> [ah]
(mm)
yes
!wah! <malay>itu aku belum</malay> check [sia] actually
but <malay>yang</malay> what I do check is there are multiple new per player roles in that sense [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] there's this [one] player <malay>dia punya</malay> role is a central midfielder
but is your central midfielder place like could deep deep lying box to box everything [kan] this guy is more for box to box player but he move towards the wings
and not towards the front or the end or the goal
[ah]
so
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay> their own behaviour in the games [lah] how they will react in the game [ah]
I have yet to check spanish league
but then most of the minor minor leagues [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I see I go to the austrian league <malay>ke</malay> I go to the
belgian I think belgian league don't have then (err)
all those minor minor small small leagues [lah]
I haven't check got I haven't really properly explored the game [lah] yesterday [lah] I mean
<malay>aku balik</malay> [jer] <malay>dah pukul satu pagi abeh aku main sampai pukul tiga pagi aku dah mampus</malay>
I tried a few clubs [ah] yesterday like (err) #dortmund#
then I switch over to (uh) chelsea then I switch over again to #zagreb# then switch over now I'm back at #dortmund#
cause you know
players and formation wise is really very very different from what we are used to [lah]
was four years [orh]
that's four years difference you know
in the span of <malay>apa tak boleh jadi macam-macam</malay> [sia] <malay>dorang</malay> improve
[siol]
<malay>dah empat tahun</malay> [sia]
<malay>kalau tak salah dah lima tahun</malay> [siol]
sixteen will be come out fifteen [pe] [ah]
<malay>tu kau masih</malay> poly so <malay>bila kau masih</malay> poly [kan] (uh)
<malay>tu kau</malay> year three <malay>aku</malay> year one so that means ya it's been five years [ah]
(uh)
by right they should be launching in september october [lah] but cause of the COVID nineteen situation
clubs are still going on there are transfers and whatnots so (err)
it will be quite late [lah] I mean for now <malay>kalau kau pergi</malay> download epic games it should be free [pe]
twenty is free on epic games
it's not a trial it's a full game for free
[ah] so if you don't want to wait for twenty one then just download for twenty first [ah]
at the end of day it's free [pe] if you don't like it you can just go and spend money and buy the twenty one [pe]
<malay>aku dah cakap dengan kau dia</malay> free
<malay>aku tak</malay> check
cause <malay>aku tahu</malay>
<malay>aku nya</malay> laptop <malay>yang</malay> I buy is meant for gaming
okay so then
Acer
Acer nitro five
NVIDIA <malay>ada ada</malay>
<malay>semua ada</malay> [ah] all settle already
but should be <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] cause on my old laptop <malay>yang aku nya</malay> graphic card is based on intel's graphic card [tau]
it's a inbuilt graphic card that
cannot do anything <malay>punya</malay>
still can be able to run sixteen so I feel like it should be fine [ah]
there there might be but but I don't think cause the simulation games do not run
highly on graphic I mean you know <malay>nya</malay> graphic <malay>macam mana</malay> [kan]
<malay>kau tahu dia nya muka kau nya</malay> avatar <malay>nya muka dah macam</malay>
[ah] then after that your players <malay>pun lari dia pun macam</malay> you you know [lah] the graphic is
<malay>macam mana</malay> [kan] so
I don't think there'll be much of a issue when it comes to graphic cards and and whatnot [lah] cause graphic is very very minimal
cause most of the game comprises of their data so what's more important in this case is (uh) <malay>kau nak kena ada banyak</malay> data <malay>untuk kau nya</malay> computer [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> computer <malay>kau tak ada</malay> data then
<malay>macam tak ada</malay> space for you to put all your memory and whatnot then <malay>tu yang</malay> problem [ah] but
if <malay>kalau</malay> computer <malay>kau aku rasa ada</malay> memory then
should be no issue [ah]
it's quite big [ah]
okay
<malay>macam</malay> slack <malay>sana sini</malay> in <malay>bola aku tahu</malay> but I
<malay>itu aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] how it will turn out [lah] but then
you can try at least [ah] maybe when you play the game then <malay>cara</malay> player <malay>dia jalan semua</malay> will be a bit
lag <malay>sana sini</malay> but on top of that
I think should be no issue already [lah] cause most of the player both of the game is data to data data to data
<malay>tu</malay> touch
no cause
I
how I see if what you say is true touch is for
not here not there <malay>punya</malay> type of products [kan] then I would see why phone will not be able to <malay>tahan</malay> by itself [lah] cause (uh) it's
very very detailed
it's there is too much detail in one team <malay>abeh kau tahu dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>kau main</malay> [kan] is just
okay player <malay>kau gini</malay> backroom <malay>kau</malay> happy <malay>dah sudah</malay>
settle <malay>sekarang dah tak</malay> [siol]
<malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] that player <malay>ada ada</malay> core player core group core social group social group A social group B social group C outliers
outliers
<malay>macam</malay> this type this player as a outlier play the backroom
so means he doesn't mix with any of the social groups so he feel left out
so you have to push him into the social league [ah] into social group <malay>kalau tak</malay> you don't kick him out so that he will not cause distress in the backroom
[ah]
so they add a psychological concept to the game [tau]
so then your core players [kan] the core backroom where it comprises of most of your senior players
your highly influential players and everything [kan]
these people can shape your entire backroom just just like that
so if this player not happy with you they cause ruckus
<malay>habis</malay> [ah] backroom <malay>kau terus habis</malay> [ah]
they influence influence influence influence <malay>terus habis semua tak suka kau abeh kau kena buang</malay>
[ah]
so it's
a more psychological concept in that game [ah]
no cause
okay you see [eh] it doesn't mean that influential person in one club is an influential person in another club
cause your influential players is players that been there the longest [tau]
so that means <malay>dia dia kirakan macam</malay> the senior of the group [tau]
okay so then <malay>kalau kau</malay> bring in a fresh new guy let's say (uh) you bring another senior player from this team <malay>masuk</malay> your team [eh]
<malay>takde gunanya</malay> cause
<malay>kau</malay> senior <malay>kat sana tapi kau masuk tempat ni kau</malay> junior <malay>juga apa</malay>
[ah]
[ah] then from there he'll become a senior influential member
it's like my #dortmund# case is
#hummels# was from #bayern# [pe]
then but before that he was from #dortmund# so <malay>bila dia balik</malay> #dortmund# straightaway <malay>dia masuk balik</malay> as a influential player
a senior in the sense <malay>tapi kalau</malay> let's say <malay>kau bawa</malay> (uh) young players like #mbappe# over to a newer club obviously he doesn't fit there [pe]
[ah] so no matter how good he is he still get outlier <malay>macam aku punya</malay> #dortmund# <malay>sekarang</malay> #sancho# is an outlier
cause one thing is
he's a foreigner
ya so he's the only english playing the entire team
so <malay>macam aku campak kau kat tempat lain pun kalau kau sorang melayu kat sana kau pun macam</malay>
it's like me when I was in the navy <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] you'll feel complete outlied cause
you cannot fit into any social group that easily
cause of the language barriers and whatnot
(mm)
(mmhmm)
he will
it depends on how well he adapt into their club [lah]
cause <malay>kau tahu</malay> players [kan] <malay>dorang ada dia punya</malay> own friends <malay>ke apa benda ke</malay> so then they have their own players that they are closed with <malay>macam kawan gitu</malay> [kan] so then <malay>kalau</malay> maybe
you bring him to a new club <malay>yang</malay> (uh)
doesn't have his friends he cannot be influential player there cause he still new [pe] even though he's old
but then <malay>kalau kau ada</malay> player <malay>macam dia suka</malay> let's say he favours (uh) I will give you buckley [lah]
okay <malay>kau</malay> bring him to the club buckley <malay>ada</malay> then maybe from there he mix with buckley he joins the social group <malay>yang penting</malay> is they join the social group
in a sense [lah] cause it will affect your dressing room <malay>nya</malay> happiness [ah]
so <malay>kalau</malay> dressing room <malay>kau tak</malay> happy they don't go out they don't have the motivation to play
then after that you cannot win games no matter how good your tactic is
your tactic may beat #barcelona# five NIL and everything but then if your players are not cohesive enough as a unit you cannot go and play apa
I mean that's what happened during #barcelona# eight two defeat to #bayern# #munich#
the dressing room wasn't cohesive enough
there's a lot of fighting in between
so your dressing room <malay>nya</malay> happiness actually
creates a huge factor in
your performance as a team [lah]
(mm)
yes it's only free up to twenty fourth of september <malay>tak salah aku</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
no no no no no no
once <malay>kau</malay> free install it's free forever it's like (uh) playstation Xbox membership
<malay>kau</malay> download the games for free you put you already collected the game already you put inside your library <malay>kau</malay> uninstall <malay>kau</malay> install <malay>balik pun</malay> the game is still be free
cause you already technically purchase for it already
(mm)
but then let's say you have (uh) twenty on your steam account okay
your twenty steam or your steam can be
crossover to your steam (uh) epic games account
you can you can try [ah] I mean the downloads speed may be quite slow [lah] cause
it's quite a big game [lah] but I connected straight to my LAN cable so it was quite fast for me [lah]
it's not your laptop <malay>nya</malay> LAN cable [pe] it's <malay>kau punya</malay> router <malay>nya</malay> cable [pe]
[ah] seriously
<malay>merepek</malay> [pe]
computer <malay>kau berapa lama</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
[oh] K K K K
okay [ah] then those things do not need high internet speed everything
[ah] then I don't think that [one] can run [lah]
no Zoom lag it's not cause of <malay>kau punya itu</malay> Zoom will lag only cause of <malay>kau punya</malay> connection
[ah]
laptop <malay>kau kau dah kau pernah bersihkan tak</malay>
internal cleaning [tau]
cause <malay>kadang-kadang kalau</malay> laptop <malay>kau</malay> is dusty or whatnot right it will affect the performance
I <malay>tak</malay> I mean
there's a few things that affect your your computer speed [lah] so dust is one thing
and then after that (uh) the make and model if it's outdated then
<malay>susah</malay> [lah] [sia] <malay>kau nak tu</malay> it'll be damn slow [ah]
I have no idea about sixty thirty gig
just be prepared for the worst [lah] I mean
that game is very intensive [sia] data <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> on <malay>tiga</malay> league [eh] <malay>aku</malay> port <malay>aku buka empat</malay> league four players per league [eh] <malay>aku nya</malay> computer speed [jer] <malay>dia punya</malay> processor speed [kan] for the whole for the whole game <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>dah</malay> four star
<malay>empat</malay> league [jer] [tau]
so it's very
it's quite intensive [lah] [ah] [ha]
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau kau nak malam kau nak jumpa boleh jumpa</malay> [ah] <malay>malam aku tak kesah</malay>
<malay>aku balik</malay> [jer] <malay>terus aku boleh jumpa kau</malay> [ah]
<malay>abeh kau fikir aku</malay> familiar [ah] <malay>kirakan aku pun baru ambil</malay> download [jer] <malay>semalam</malay>
[eh] [eh]
ya I downloaded it yesterday okay <malay>aku tak</malay> I never touch the app
<malay>aku tu dah jumpa kau</malay> [pe]
correct <malay>aku</malay> download <malay>aku jumpa kau</malay> after <malay>aku kita berbual semua</malay> and everything <malay>aku balik dah pukul satu pagi</malay>
<malay>aku buka tu</malay> computer <malay>aku tukar</malay> cup <malay>sana sini tukar tukar tukar aku tidur pukul tiga pagi</malay>
<malay>main apa</malay>
ya in a sense [ah]
[oh] okay
look the thing is I only found out about the social group thing today
so before I met you I was I was looking through the game again [lah] to familiarise myself with what the hell is going on [kan] so
there is that thing [lah] I just found out about it today only another new feature of their tab [kan] <malay>yang</malay> came out
in this version was the medical centre
[ah] so you can jump into the medical centre to see your injured players
I don't know why they think that would be a good addition to your
no <malay>kau</malay> maybe let's say (uh) okay cause <malay>kau tahu</malay> you can remove there is a filter in your first few squad [pe] so <malay>kau boleh</malay> remove filter [ah] hide injured players
hide players to icloud so then you go to medical centre you can see which players injured then can see how long they injured for
then maybe there is
interactions and whatnot [lah] I haven't really jump into medical centre yet [lah] you can explore it later [ah]
<malay>merepek</malay> [sia] <malay>kau</malay>
technically you are <malay>apa</malay> [kan] <malay>bodoh</malay>
[ah] <malay>tu kau nak</malay>
I mean honestly if we've bought the game during circuit breaker [eh] !whoa! that would be damn good
[oh] you just press play play play play for ages [siol]
[oh] ya there is a singapore league inside [ah] ya
[eh] <malay>kau tahu kau fikir dorang tinggal kat</malay> singapore [pe]
[ah] you
I mean this is a precedented situation [pe]
<malay>dulu kau boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>tak ada</malay> coronavirus you can just go around and [ah] <malay>beli beli beli beli abeh sekarang dah gitu semua dah balik</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> stuck [lah] unless they didn't go home they stay in your country [ah]
[ah] then <malay>gitu</malay> maybe (uh)
<malay>kau ada</malay> chance [ah] to play and whatnot [lah] but if
they do go home
and the game realised that actually they went off for holiday and they cannot come back due to borders being closed
then there's an issue you have to settle [lah] I mean [ah] like like there's one club
in twenty you can try to manage bolton wanderers
lead one club
okay the issue with that club is they on the verge of bankruptcy
okay so you start the game
without the full squad
okay so most of your players that you start with are semi-pro
so slowly you have to sign them to a professional contract then you have to
bring up players from youth intake everything so you really start the game with
zero money
minimum wages
[eh] <malay>apa tu</malay>
half your squad missing [ah]
[ah]
all the north [ah]
even the north south are not semi-pro [tau]
they are pro you know
maybe if <malay>satu hari</malay> you go lower than that <malay>baru</malay> you come out with a semi-pro club
fall from grace [ah] I mean
financial difficulty
okay
remember the portmore's incident
okay so this is portmore times ten
the portmore they were able to sell off [ah] their assets and everything to keep the club afloat at the same time
they sold off a lot the high players away
and replace them with [ah] cheaper options so there wasn't so bad on their end [lah] cause they got rid of the budget first
but bolton wanderers is when they were relegated with championship they still kept most of the star players okay so then they paid
[ah] crazy wages to keep them alive and then they pay pay pay pay
but then they realised cause of financial difficulty their club will bankrupt they had to deduct the points
so even if you win games your point <malay>kena</malay> deducted
so you end up still going down [pe]
(mm)
it depends [lah] cause
unless you
liquidate the club [ah]
unless you dissolve the club [ah]
<malay>takde</malay>
no
until someone else <malay>macam</malay> you know what
I buy over your club
<malay>atau</malay> they pump <malay>atau</malay> your board just okay you know what screw it I pump in a lot of assets
so once you pump in assets your club
once your club is maintained at the state whereby
you're neither bankrupt you're neither rich you're just in between just nice to survive for the club right
<malay>dah sudah</malay>
whether your club is churning a loss or profit it doesn't matter to them as long as you're financially stable to keep your club afloat
cause as as you go relegated [kan] cause of the financial fair play rules (uh) you're only allowed a certain amount of money in your club
so the more you get relegated after a while you be quite stable cause the amount of money you have is let's say you have two K
okay in order for you to play a premier league you need maybe ten K so
you relegate up cause you only have two K you relegate time <malay>tu</malay> championship which needs five K
so not enough money you relegate down to league one which needs three K not enough money you relegate down to league two then two K two K [pe] just nice your club will stay afloat
but whether your club <malay>kat dalam</malay> [ah] the club <malay>kau ada</malay> loss <malay>ke ada</malay> profit <malay>ke</malay> [ah] there it
<malay>tak kira dah</malay> cause at the end of day
<malay>kalau</malay> player <malay>kau</malay>
okay with small wages
and then play as what they are then there is no issue [ah]
unless
you been relegated down and you job's board to make very very bad decision along the way
then you still keep going down [ah] until you meet a league where
it fits your
financial [ah]
or
the board give up
liquidate the club
<malay>ada</malay>
<malay>ada</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> there are there are a few clubs that did that the most recent [one] was this italian club I forgot what club it was
so they face financial difficulties they were in #serie# [ah]
okay #serie# A
okay so <malay>dah tinggi</malay> [pe] <malay>kirakan</malay> #serie# A [pe] <malay>dia</malay> up there [tau] and then
[ah]
<malay>itu lain</malay> [lah] <malay>itu tak kira</malay> [lah] <malay>bodoh</malay>
[ha]
third corruption
okay so what did club did was [ah] they had to stay afloat cause they do not have enough money to
[ah] to stay afloat [lah] so (uh) what #juventus# did was #juventus# pump in money for them
to keep them afloat but it wasn't enough so
instead of dropping
the board like they just liquidate the club so the club cease to be existed cease to be exist [ah] <malay>terus hilang</malay>
<malay>nari ada</malay> club <malay>esok takde</malay> club [ah] <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
so <malay>terus takde</malay> [ah] then club <malay>dia hilang</malay> that's one thing so (uh) what
the fans did was they gather together a small sum of money each fan <malay>kasi berapa ke</malay>
that you know [lah] some of the fans in this club [kan] quite rich [pe] so <malay>dorang kata</malay> okay you know what <malay>aku suka</malay> club <malay>ni</malay> but then <malay>sekarang hilang sebab apa dorang takde duit</malay> okay [ah] <malay>aku</malay> pump <malay>duit</malay>
so I give you money I give you money I give you money we build a new club from scratch using the same name
[ah] then after that
you start off at the basic league then you climb up again [ah]
then whether your players from your old club want to stay in the new club
that's a whole different thing [ah]
but it is possible [ah] like clubs like
wimbledon wimbledon [ah] that is a new club by itself
cause they split from dons then they come out themselves
so
they are history of clubs going around like this [ah] where they disappeared they dissolve the club and they come out with a new club with the same name
english clubs wise there were a few but they are now in the you know
the bottom bottom leagues [lah] I mean you can go through wikipedia and they will tell you about this [lah]
there are a few clubs with history that
go around like this [ah] (err) one particular example I know is dons [ah]
dons and wimbledon but the one is more of a split decision
so then [ah]
but <malay>ada ada yang lain</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> really <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] [sia] <malay>kau kena kau kena</malay>
<malay>cari sendiri</malay> [ah] <malay>tu aku</malay>
<malay>ada</malay>
<malay>ada ada</malay>
english
<malay>kita ada</malay> [sia] actually
I mean you think about it in singapore we have our S league
okay then we have our delta league
then you have your sunday league A sunday league B sunday league C you have all sort of leagues going on I mean I played in a few leagues myself <malay>apa</malay> so then they have been a lot of leagues where you can actually
climb up the league as you progress along
okay then hopefully you're good enough with financial stability to go into S league but then
<malay>kita mimpi</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [eh]
at the end of day <malay>kita semua</malay> semi-pro [sia]
I mean
if you're passionate about it then okay [pe] <malay>macam</malay>
look look at our situation
you used to [lah] still am [lah] so it's a difference
<malay>dah gemuk cakap</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>dah gemuk tak yah</malay> [lah]
definitely [ah] I mean look at your size
<malay>tu masuk angin bodoh tu bukan banyak makan</malay>
ya [lah] it's cause
no [lah] maybe and also cause
like one point of time where you stop playing for awhile [pe]
so then <malay>macam</malay>
ya [lah] so then you you stop for how long after that
you do not have regular trainings you do not have regular exercise so
everything change [lah]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kau baru nak cakap</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [ah]
<malay>dalam empat tahun</malay> [jer] [lah]
I
<malay>aku dah dalam dua dua tahun juga tak main</malay> [ah] I mean
<malay>sekarang dengan</malay> situation <malay>gini camne aku nak main bola</malay> [sia]
ya like
what my cousin did was during futsal [kan] before the pandemic situation [ah] then they said no slide tackle that was the rule no slide tackle
so what this guy did was <malay>dia tak</malay> slide [ah]
okay so imagine the players charging towards you [eh] running with the ball and everything
I'm in front of you I cannot slide <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> slide tackle <malay>kau</malay> [kan] so <malay>aku baring</malay> on the floor [ah]
<malay>aku baring</malay> [jer]
<malay>terus</malay> bola will hit <malay>badan aku kau</malay> will jump over me <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>aku bangun</malay> I take the ball run away [ah]
idea [kan]
<malay>terus yang dia cakap dengan aku terus aku cam</malay>
<malay>aku tak pernah dengar</malay> [sia] <malay>orang buat gini kau</malay> first time [siol] <malay>abeh macam</malay>
you have to be innovative
you're bending the rules while stay in the rules referee couldn't say anything cause he wasn't sliding
his body was on the floor but he wasn't sliding
so they have to let it go
it was a tackle
<malay>boleh boleh</malay> cause
if
I mean it's been six years right since you last played right so maybe you
how long has it been since you actually watch football
that still two years ago at least [tau]
<malay>takde</malay> time [kan]
no [lah] I mean
[ah] ya [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean
at the end of the day
<malay>memang gitu</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>apa kau nak buat</malay> [kan]
<malay>kerja tetap kerja apa daripada kau takde duit</malay> I mean <malay>tengok kita sekarang</malay>
no [lah] <malay>yang</malay> the <malay>apa tu</malay>
one thing <malay>yang</malay> we need to go and find [kan] is that cup #lee hsien loong# used
[eh] <malay>tu cawan bagus</malay> [siol] <malay>kau minum</malay> [jer] <malay>kau tukar kau boleh berbual</malay> [ah] <malay>bahasa lain</malay> [sia]
<malay>aku minum melayu aku minum cina aku minum</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay>
solid [sia]
<malay>dia boleh</malay> [pe]
<malay>dia boleh</malay>
<malay>dia empat-empat semua boleh</malay>
<malay>kau tak</malay> I mean the the election before the previous election [kan]
I forgot which year that was [lah] (err)
was it two thousand fifteen or two thousand ten [ah] around there [lah]
okay
there was one time where the when
those running for election they have to sit in front of of the camera
and give a speech as to why you should vote their party okay so [ah] every other party [kan]
so for the respective channels like channel five channel eight #suria# and the #vasantham# channel so (uh) every other channel they set down a member of
that race to talk in that language but for the
all across all four channels #lee hsien loong# face
talking all four languages
nobody dubbed over him [ah]
it was a thirty minutes speech
<malay>abeh</malay>
I would listen to <malay>melayu</malay> if I somewhat understood #chim# malay [lah] I mean <malay>kau tengok</malay> when I had to go for the interview in malay [eh] <malay>nanti kena berbual bahasa melayu ye</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> #gabra# [siol]
<malay>aku berbual sana sini abeh aku masukkan ini sini sana sedikit</malay> so it was a very singlish mixed malay type of thing [ah] so it's like how I'm talking to you now okay then [oh] okay sorry <malay>nak kena berbual melayu</malay> so <malay>nari buat gini gini gini abeh apa</malay> word <malay>ni</malay> [eh]
<malay>takpe aku keluarkan</malay> english word [ah] then I speak english again so it's very
ya I mean
no [lah] I mean okay you see [eh] for their generation right
only for okay actually
for our generation [eh] for our generation [ah] at the most [ah]
our first language is usually english
it's not it's no longer our mother tongue it's always it's always english I've seen kids <malay>macam hari tu aku pergi</malay> [ah] <malay>aku gi pancing</malay> [pe] <malay>kat</malay> #changi# [kan]
<malay>aku tengok budak-budak main bila dorang main nak berbual dengan</malay> each other [kan] they don't talk in malay
it was a full out english fest so I was confused whether <malay>itu budak cina ke tu budak melayu</malay> cause <malay>dia berbual</malay> english [kan] <malay>dia nya</malay> english was
quite solid
okay it's
better than our parents [lah] in a in a sense [lah] cause their english was quite fluent so when I look over it's actually malay kids so <malay>aku macam</malay>
okay <malay>ni budak melayu</malay> and then <malay>budak melayu tak boleh berbual melayu</malay>
so these are the kids where
their the english is a very first language mother tongue is their second language for our elders it's the other way
<malay>melayu</malay> is a first language english is their second language
so obviously you only remember your first language [pe] cause that's the first language you're most fluent with
so there's a chance <malay>bila kita dah tua</malay>
<malay>kita tak akan ingat</malay> any other language except for
english [ah] cause
that's the language that we are used to
but then you weren't in malaysia <malay>apa</malay> you were in singapore customs so you wasn't she wasn't in malaysia she was in singapore
from but you said in [ah]
probably [ah] babe
I don't think it's depending on [ah] your mother tongue whether your mother tongue is your core language or english is your core language what I think is the language you're most proficient in [lah]
language that you use most often cause let's say [kan]
for example [lah] <malay>kita tak tahu berbual melayu</malay> at all <malay>dia langsung tak ada melayu</malay> okay <malay>kita cuma boleh berbual</malay> english
[ah] so that means
no
no that means you need when you grow you only remember english [ah] okay I mean
look at the americans they don't have a second language they only have one language [pe] english is their only language so when they grow they only remember english [pe]
so maybe let's say maybe they learn french or what along the way
then they cannot speak their french language cause they only remember that english language as a core subject
this a this is the language they use everyday
you see back in our elders' time the language they use everyday is malay [pe] maybe that <malay>makcik</malay> was <malay>sebab apa tu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia belajar</malay>
english <malay>dengan dari tempat lain</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> forever concentrate <malay>dengan</malay> english
[ah] <malay>abeh kita tak tahu</malay> [pe] anything can happen [kan]
[ah] <malay>ye abeh lepas tu aku dah berbual gitu kau faham tak</malay> [kan] <malay>apa gunanya aku berbual</malay> [kan] <malay>betul tak</malay>
I mean at the end of day also
all these old people <malay>kalau</malay> you actually listen to them talk [kan] some of them do make sense [lah] I mean they can impart some life lessons but other time <malay>merepek</malay> [sia] <malay>dengar</malay>
ya <malay>sudah dah sudah itu itu kau jangan nak bawa balik</malay>
[oh] <malay>dia jiran kau</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tu kau boleh buat</malay> member
<malay>aku nampak pernah nampak dia jalan balik kat sini</malay> so <malay>aku tak tahu dia tinggal mana</malay> okay [lah] <malay>aku dah tahu</malay> [ah]
<malay>mana tahu dia nak buat kawan dengan kau ini budak aku macam kenal</malay> [ah] <malay>hari tu aku nak buat kawan dengan dia</malay> [ah] it can be like that [pe]
he will do [one]
okay but
I mean
all I see <malay>tadi</malay> (err) <malay>bila aku nak naik gi rumah kau ni</malay> [kan] <malay>aku sesat</malay> (uh)
<malay>aku</malay> dah <malay>masuk</malay> lift okay so there was another couple with me in the lift so they press the twelve floor then I down there <malay>aku</malay> stuck <malay>dekat dengan nombor tu aku tengok</malay>
<malay>tingkat mana</malay> [sia] <malay>dia tinggal aku lupa lapan ke sebelas</malay> then in my mind
eleven or eight eleven or eight [ah] screw it I go eight I go eleven first is eleven then I turn if wrong I just go down [pe] it's better than coming up [kan] the stairs [kan] okay eleven let's go
so the lift brought me up to eleven I open the door
[ah] thank god
correct house [eh] <malay>kalau tak malu</malay> [sia] <malay>aku turun lagi pergi tingkat lapan</malay>
<malay>kau tahu</malay> last <malay>aku datang rumah kau bila</malay> [ah]
time <malay>kau</malay> [tau]
time <malay>kau</malay>
time <malay>kau</malay> CISCO <malay>aku tak datang rumah kau</malay> [tau]
<malay>ada sekali kau datang</malay> [eh] no there was one before after <malay>kau</malay> CISCO <malay>juga aku baru masuk</malay> so time <malay>kau datang sebab kita baru keluar makan pastu kau nak</malay>
<malay>balik rumah kau nak</malay> change out to your army uniform and everything to book in so <malay>aku teman kau aku datang rumah</malay>
then <malay>aku lepak-lepak kat</malay> living room <malay>kau</malay>
second time was cause <malay>kita nak keluar makan dengan</malay> parents <malay>aku pastu kau suruh aku datang rumah kau kejap entah buat apa</malay> that was the only two times [ah]
to sit down and properly <malay>lepak dalam rumah kau ni</malay> the last time I did that <malay>kita masih</malay> secondary school
I can tell [lah] I mean
most of time <malay>aku jumpa kau bukan kat rumah</malay> [pe]
is outside of house
ya there is a there's a [ah]
a cycle to work to look forward to [lah] everyday [lah] but now is just
<malay>masih</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay>
<malay>itu</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
I mean
<malay>kau</malay>
<malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] the situation <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] you've been unemployed longer than I have
you know how the you know how the market is now right you know I regret now is I did not extend my service longer
I really regret not extending my service longer even though I had to suffer inside [lah]
mean with the multiple sailings that I have to go for but at least it's there is a routine for me to follow
and at least I get paid
I get good pay you know but
!haiya!
it's a shame [ah]
no cause I know you tried to warn me but as I look forward in the schedule right
the schedule was really
!whoa!
<malay>teruk</malay> [siol]
<malay>macam kau tahu sekarang</malay>
singapore airlines send out their flights to nowhere [kan]
singapore airlines now flights to nowhere <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan]
so <malay>kapal terbang dia keluar</malay>
<malay>pusing pusing pusing pusing pusing pastu balik</malay> [ah] <malay>tak gi mana-mana</malay>
no just to maintain airtime and to <malay>apa tu</malay> free up [ah] parking space
cause <malay>kalau kapal kau kapal terbang kau tak terbang</malay> for very long
it can run down <malay>macam</malay> let's say aircon you don't use your aircon for very long aircon can spoil it's the same thing with aeroplanes [ah]
(mm) so you're burning a lot of fuels fuels cost money
which is why most of their [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay> employees all retrenched
cause
you're dishing out a lot of money but you're not getting back any money
I mean for ship wise it's different [pe] everyday you have to use your vessel
<malay>kau masuk</malay> if you want your things to run you have to on your generators you cannot plug in to a short supply your short supply will not be enough
(mm)
no [ah]
it's still quite low [lah] but it's not
that low also [lah] I mean
<malay>kau tak leh</malay> compare
car oil and (uh) jet fuel jet fuel is bloody expensive
so and they use how much cars use how much
you see that there's a huge difference [ah]
from how many litres to how many of litres [ah] so
<malay>ada beza dia dok tu pasal</malay>
<malay>mahal</malay> that's why they
<malay>terpaksa buang orang sana buang orang sini</malay>
no [lah] that [one]
it really depends on current situation [ah] I mean
as of now damn slow [ah]
to pick up [ah]
honestly this situation is worst when corona [ah] worst than SARS [pe]
so it's
no now cause now is cause of the trade war okay they fighting over the trade war
wants to be a superpower but china is really
rapidly coming up and they cannot stop
and recently recently government
ban the postal service from sending masks to every household in america
so the <malay>apa tu</malay> the postal <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] <malay>aku nak buat</malay> deed good deed so [ah] <malay>aku nak</malay> send out
free masks to every household just for free [ah] <malay>aku</malay> send out to everybody everybody can be safe
and they no no no no no <malay>aku tak</malay> approve <malay>ni tak boleh</malay> masks <malay>tak</malay> work the masks doesn't work so no
and then some more there's this person they came out with a a mask a mask a proper face mask with holes inside <malay>macam</malay> fish nets
<malay>kau tahu</malay> fishing net [kan] <malay>ada lubang lubang tu</malay> [kan] so mask <malay>dia berlubang</malay>
and then <malay>kau pakai</malay> so case <malay>kau masih boleh nampak mulut nampak hidung</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi kau masih pakai</malay> mask
[ah] so then the
this this lady was saying !wah! this a very useful mask still can breathe I can be compliant but not be compliant
they are the first to die they are the first to die hello [ah] [seh] they are first to die
I mean the citizens are doing same thing [lah] so I
[ah] <malay>ye</malay> mask doesn't work but then the first
that but then doctors and nurses all have been using it for damn long cause it doesn't work [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
think logically [lah] I mean the reason what america are thinking like this also cause
the education in the system in the first place isn't good to begin with
