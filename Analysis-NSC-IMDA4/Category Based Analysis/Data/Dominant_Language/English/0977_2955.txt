okay so the you know the (um) with a song that I showed you just now is it's it's basically (um) it's a K pop song by shinee
(um) ya so (um) so how they use it on tiktok is like it's either the humorous or funny (uh) K pop humour the the jokes on tiktok or it's like used by like thirst traps you know
too and and and then they <malay>dia orang</malay> like <malay>buat</malay> videos <malay>yang</malay> can make you pause for a while and like [oh] I'll double tap that
it's I never heard I never heard
[oh] okay okay (uh) maybe I think so like you know pull you like in to my side
<malay>entah aku tak tahu</malay> but we'll find out soon
I recently learn this term it's called (um) (um)
kissing my teeth but if you've seen it on twitter stands for kissing my teeth
so like (um) like you're not you know that that meme <malay>yang</malay> the person is like (um) like they're not happy they are annoyed
ya so that's what it means so if you see <malay>maknanya</malay> kiss kiss my teeth
so like for example (uh)
what what's the [oh] ya ya ya ya I know it's so true [oh] my god
like once you respond <malay>habis</malay> that's it (mm)
I do it you know I've got come my <malay>adik</malay> I do it at #nasha# when I ask her to like get me something
[eh] #nasha#
I am a <malay>minah</malay> at heart
[ah] I mean like that number [ah] the number the number of hours I'll be on tiktok everyday is just ridiculous
so (um) like on on on wednesday because I was working from home
like I finish work at six right immediately you know like for me right it's very clear
it's six o'clock that's it I <malay>tutup</malay> my laptop I roll over to my bed and I <malay>buka</malay> tiktok
I stayed there for three hours
scrolling endless scrolling and I didn't realise that three hours had passed until my sister knock on my door
and she was like you <malay>tak nak makan</malay> [eh] and I was like [oh] right dinner I totally forgot
it's so addictive I love it
I learn so much I love it
ya that's that's the tea
I got into
(um) because I saw quite a bit of it on on twitter right because tiktok videos are very easily (uh) loaded and shared and I think that's one of the main (um)
main powers or main advantages of tiktok like for for instagram it's it's not very easy for you to port over or to share if you share like (err) an instagram post it always comes in a link but whereas for tiktok videos you can download it and you can share it on (uh) any
(uh) any any app any social media app
like like it's like a native post which is great
here you are native post
today I learn so <malay>macam</malay> like you know people can watch the videos very easily they can say [oh] that it's from this app called tiktok and at first it's like you know at first I I thought it was like the musically <malay>yang bodoh punya</malay>
ya <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
yes yes and we know that musically <malay>dengan</malay> vine <malay>tu semua budak kecil</malay>
yes like the <malay>budak mana</malay> from #clementi# <malay>tengah buat</malay> dancing
[ah] tiktok is the same
but it's just not on your page cause it's well curated [oh] I see it is on your page
what have you been watching
right right and sometimes like you know when you want to test out if a video is gonna be popular so you just show like on on on your even though it's not your scene so if you like it
so that so that
ya the algorithm so don't know whether it's popular or not just randomly give to bunch of people and if there's a high percentage of people who like the video then they spread it even more
so that's why sometimes you realize [eh] you got videos will have about fifty or sixty and just kept there doesn't load so once (uh) once it realizes that [eh] this video isn't as popular as with the other users then it just doesn't show anymore
so that's how they determine the priority
correct correct yes yes they really wanna see that
yes
or is it you don't want grab ge</mandarin> to see you
[oh] !wow!
[oh] [oh] !wow! amazing !wow!

hashtag
multifunction
be up to be like her for real like give me listening to guide to grab food in like reading chinese novel play what bro
you and that was a that was the plot twist that I did not see to be honest
what's the point where do you where I don't like I thought that you know you should you should explicitly referring to like japanese stuff anyway you probably won't go the other way sitting right
[ha] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] I thought that you know it should be exclusive if you're like into japanese stuff #anime# you probably won't go the other way
ya
but it's okay sis you got what you call that you got range
it's what
ya you got range
what's your exact the plot twist that I didn't quite expect you know watching #anime#
ya I've I really truly enjoy watching saturday and ya I'm so ashamed for like you know you know anyways but I'm I'm watching I don't know if you know this show it's got #saiki#
the disastrous life of #saiki#
[oh] that's good
(um) it's more slice of life I guess (um) so I guess I prefer that kind rather than <malay>macam</malay> like actually the things I remember watching
but it's very very promising and I might start on it
okay okay so I might I start ya so this one is more of like (um) slightly modern japan and it's basically revolving around this character called #saiki# (um)
who is basically a psychic then and he has like extraordinary superpowers so <malay>macam</malay> for him right he wears his like pink antennas on his head
so apparently that helps to curb his powers <malay>kalau dia tak pakai</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti dia bangun pagi</malay> [kan] <malay>terus dia punya rumah dah habis dah</malay>
like exploded
so like he needs to so okay so his power is like literally anything that he touches expected to stone or like or if if someone say it's can you like <malay>urut</malay> me like he would <malay>urut</malay> and then after that you will just your body whole body just like just becomes a ball because he just his power is just too strong or he kicks someone okay so there's was this one scene
strength [ah] yes yes yes so I was like talking about like
powerful strength and he can also (uh) teleport (um)
he he can he has pyrokinesis or something so he can like keep himself warm literally any power you can think of
he could do that too
like like literally like any power you can think of he has it so the whole #anime#
ya it's just him
the whole #anime# revolves around him and his life in school like how he's trying to keep (uh) people like his close friends from knowing what his power is and the most interesting thing is that throughout the whole #anime# he never opens his mouth
ya
so it's just so because he also has telepathy
(um) you can hear his voice but you won't see him open his mouth
people can hear I I guess the thing is people don't realize it but they're hearing his voice through telepathy
it's so <malay>merepek</malay> but it's so good it's so <malay>kelakar gila</malay> like if you have the time then give it like one episode I love it so much like during lunch breaks
my one hour is so precious while I heat up my food and go eat right
I watch three episodes
it's twenty minutes long
okay fine like twenty one twenty two minutes I okay may have taken more than
I don't skip I love everything about it
okay yes yes I skip the intro that's what I do you have to skip the intro so like just one hour straight I'll just watch [ah] #saiki# it was so good and the thing is I think there's like a couple of seasons I <malay>rasa belum habis</malay>
like I've started two three weeks ago I <malay>rasa belum habis</malay>
(um) I don't know it's about twenty three plus
I watch I watch during lunchtime I watch during dinner time <malay>tak habis-habis</malay> [tau] I'm like <malay>bila ni</malay>
ya but I still can't finish
and I watched that many episodes for lunchtime and also I'm like !wow!
right right I should have finished like one season
<malay>aku tak tahu ada berapa</malay> season <malay>berapa banyak</malay> episode I'm still with season two [tau] season freaking two
ya ya
[oh] ya ya ya ya
[oh] <malay>yang</malay> total <malay>aku tak tahu aku belum</malay> I don't even know how many seasons there are sorry
I'm starting there
ya it's like to it's she's own I guess I prefer that [lah] cause I guess I can relate to it more <malay>macam</malay> #shonen# is like a little bit more difficult for me cause you have to
ya you really have to get into it
even this one <malay>tak masuk akal pun</malay> at least I I can relate
[oh]
maybe it's just like the frequencies type of things
yes
drama
those I vaguely recall watching a #gundam# series on kids central
[oh]
ya
(mm) (mm)
yes yes
yes
(mmhmm)
ya
okay okay
(mm)
that's very interesting I've actually thought of that
fact #gundam# I all I all I remember is I I watched it but it's more of like background noise
cause never really got into it
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay okay
(hmm)
it was really good
back then like when you thought it was good and then you check further more into #gundam# and you're like no
#gundam#
I I actually (um) because I brought home #najhah's# <malay>punya</malay> (um) #haikyu# jacket and
[ah] it fits out quite nicely thank goodness cause she's actually quite pudgy now (um)
yes she's she's tall tall is one thing she's also like quite <malay>berisi juga</malay> like she's not stick thin
so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't internet [lah] correct
(um) so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't she wouldn't fit into the jacket
plus it's like her favourite show so I <malay>tak nak hampakan</malay> [lah]
but thankfully it fits and she was like okay nevermind it's not my favourite team but it's okay I like it okay good you know that's great
and she hasn't taken it off like when I left the house she's still wearing it
she loves it so much
me too so I think
[ah] no I think it's still with #aisyah# okay nevermind that's fine
ya so (um)
I I told her like [eh] sorry [ah] I really cannot bring you because sixteen and I don't want you to start thinking that movie ratings are just a suggestion even even if it is like I want you to take them seriously but didn't tell her that of course you know because that would (um)
they would insinuate that some people don't take it seriously told her like sorry movie rating is sixteen and you're not sixteen so you cannot watch (um)
but some countries
she knows but some countries its thirteen I saw [ah] I saw on reddit she's on fucking reddit
she's on freaking Reddit for like anime I was just like [oh] my goodness you really cannot like if you have any questions like you can you go ask me at least I can ask <malay>kak zan</malay> and <malay>kak najhah</malay> you <malay>jangan macam gini</malay> [eh]
it is where I feel like you need to be ready it but
ya (um) it's it takes some getting used to but reddit can be particularly useful when like for example okay back then when I was really into my like fitness craze (um) there was some like reddit pages like how to lose with reddit
or like the before and after reddit so this kind like you when you follow you get along motivation from people cause it's super positive so it really depends [lah] or it's more of like Q&A or like one of my favorites is (err) five which is explain like I'm five
so ya so like you know and they have like really (um) topics that you don't understand like (uh) explain like I'm five what is bitcoin and someone will explain it to you in a clearer simple english so it can be beneficial but it can also be like a cesspool
and there was like this particular Reddit page was so I'm now more if you but I used to follow it because (um)
I like to read like I like tea you know to (um)
and it was on relationships or like am I the asshole
ya so at first it was really really fun because like you know you get to see like
some how are some people are just really ridiculous [tau] <malay>merepek gila</malay> [tau] <malay>dia punya perangai</malay> and then after awhile I realized that for
for one of the commenters their suggestions or with their (um) comments is always [oh] this guy is definitely an asshole break up with him break up with him even though it's like things like marriage
or like ya it's like a marriage like leave this guy he's not fit to be like your husband or this
the the father of the children I'm like these are really drastic opinions that you have like you I get it that you know I I feel like just from one activity like this you cannot just say things like that
stop being freaking childish
[ha] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
correct correct so even though like
maybe from the description like the situations really really bad [lah] I feel like there are many other ways to resolve it rather than leave the man he's trash his men disposal service I'm telling you that you this man is screwed up
ya ya
so you mean if the person is really lost or really confused and they see all these responses and the ones with the most therefore you know endorsements from people is divorce the man
so
[oh] ya so back to [ah] so (um) so I asked her like (uh) can you give like (uh)
like a summary of the story cause I couldn't catch up without having to be dark somewhere [lah] and she was like
no you don't want to bring me nevermind it's okay but you want to know more then you better binge watch by yourself
then I was like goodness me this person
which of course you know you only have one season so yesterday
#izz# can easily catch up [eh]
[ah] okay [lah] not bad [lah]
[oh] yes
not bad
she was telling me also like it's okay if you can't bring me I'll just find online I was like [eh] sixteen where you want to find online <malay>macam mana</malay> cannot because it's sixteen you cannot watch she's like I'll find the thirteen one
and I'm like you're not thirteen yet you just turned twelve last month she's just like I'll find a way
(mm)
[ah]
ya ya ya okay
sub technically I got a
but ya
I'm also trying to think that where is the sixteen is from the blood from the slashing of men
[oh] okay okay okay
all right all right okay okay send
[oh] my god okay okay but you know I only realize how important we think when I watched
(um) this movie I think it's called the spy movie I watched it with #sha# it was after A levels
(um) I watched it at downtown east so essentially the story is about (uh) this dowdy the spy support executive or something played by
(um) came up a name something mccarthy
this pudgy comedian (um)
okay nevermind so there was this like okay so there was this (um) spies
jesse mccartney no [lah] that's a singer <malay>merepek</malay> [jer] <malay>sampai</malay> [jer] <malay>kutuk aku</malay> <malay>bukan</malay>
no no it's not jesse mccartney
but
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] (uh) <malay>tak boleh haram</malay>
it was a spy movie and it was I think M eighteen I mean we were nineteen back then like you know you could easily walk in
ya
so then we walked in and we watched a movie and that was the first time I saw a like a real life actual dick
ya
!wow! really he's fine movie it's all netflix you have netflix actually I mean I do I mean not that you wouldn't want to watch you just because somebody but what's my first sign on only
ya it was a spy movie it's on netflix are you on netflix I should take you
I mean not that you would want to watch it just because of the but it was my first time an I wanna what
I'll just keep it to myself
I was so surprised I was really taken aback because I will just was not expecting
it's not not full frontal it's literally a close up because okay so the scene was (um) a man who accidentally to or rather a man is taking some sex videos
so he actually zoom in into like his own like a dick
so that was the scene and (uh) so he was videotaped right and then the spies executive who became a spy
was looking through the content inside the camcorder and she she came across that I'm like wait what
I couldn't believe that a comedy movies staring that comedian was was going to show me my first ever dick
ya so after that
he was pretty normal about it I think
ya I'm pretty sure
I was like [oh] I was really full I couldn't pay attention for the next ten minutes
ya then I was like okay so that's how a dick looks like in real life thank you (um)
and then ya so I guess from then on I realise how important ratings were
and also like you know you when it's M eighteen
when it's R twenty one you better make sure that you know
I was not prepared
(uh huh) like nudity or sexual references (uh) ya but normally when you see those you like you're not too bothered by it because you've seen it before and they're like ending [oh] it's probably just the butt or something
so that was very interesting
ya I was legal and I knew what it looked like comically I suppose
but I was just I didn't expect to see it on big screen
(mm)
what I get to is shooting up then I'm like [oh] okay !wow!
that was like twenty fifteen and I still remember it [oh] my goodness
ya I was so shy he was very indifferent about I was like it was a lot
[ah] <malay>biasa</malay> okay [lah] <malay>bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>apa apa</malay> [lah] #shah#
ya !alah!
[ah] right right right
ya
ya ya honestly like I mean it it does feel like a burden sometimes by I feel like if I don't do it who else is going to do it and I really you just hope that she sees it as me
guiding her through this rather than me telling her no cannot this one cannot
so like for me it's always about
(um) this is not the time for you to explore such things here
and the good thing is that she doesn't run away from this kind of conversations
she sits and she is squirmish she's very like a little bit uncomfortable
like when we talk about like watching you know ya #wey# or like whatever she's like a bit squirmish but
we have have to sit through this
I think she's more intrigued than interested she just wants to find out like what is it or if if it's like this like okay it started out with #haikyu# she was really into #haikyu# her friends got into it and naturally because this is about competition this is about brotherhood
it dwells into a little bit of that area of boy's love their only thing
so I really had to just guide her a bit and making sure that she understands that (um) but whatever she's reading is not necessarily normal in an irregular relationship ya
I just wanted to like impact her brain not this early please
the strange perceptions there
I mean I honestly can't speak for you so I don't know
ya it's like how when I watch those malaysian romance (uh) series
when I was younger [lah] when I was like sixteen seventeen eighteen
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] [oh] my god that is is so true like we were big kids already
[a'ah]
it really impacted the way (um) I saw how relationships or is
like how they start with marriages like how they are very like you know the girls always like <malay>tunduk</malay> to the husband
then like you must always listen to your husband and the husband
ya and when I look back and I'm like no no no like
when I interim put that my malaysian friend offer is like
why
take actually to check out eatery do like
you should just have said <malay>tiga</malay> so
<malay>kau datang dari</malay> drama <malay>mana ni</malay>
ya
recently I watched because it came out on netflix I watched <malay>nur</malay>
it's so basically okay the is quite interesting okay so it's about this (um) new <malay>ustaz baru</malay> graduate from syria or something like worst of the countries
he came back and he is on track to take over his father's business
ya and his father is like a a celebrity preacher
who has his own (um) <malay>tahfiz</malay> school and his own <malay>masjid</malay>
wrong wrong islamic consultancy maybe
so (uh) so he's a very popular
preacher on on and when he came back he is slated to take over the father's business
and then one day while he was giving the <malay>ceramah subuh</malay> thank god he he
cause you pick your nice actually somebody you know I didn't Q&A session are we I no one is it
<malay>kat masjid dia orang</malay> and then he received like some questions of people (um) and it's really weird because
[ha] <malay>dia orang</malay> Q&A <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> [kan]
<malay>ada</malay> Q&A session (uh) the questions were
ya serious curious cat islamic version <malay>masjid</malay> version
and then like the questions were apparently very you know intriguing and like (uh) thought provoking he wanted to know who it was from turns out (um) it was from this girl
<malay>bila keluar masjid then dia nampak</malay> this <malay>kelibat perempuan yang sedang menulis</malay> on a white piece of paper
and it turns out to be like a a prostitute from like a nearby neighbour
so he was intrigued and ya plot twist
so like his initial (um) like emotional said he felt
like disgusted but still
like respectful the person like
he was <malay>macam</malay> ya like !wow!
these sort of kind of questions that you know you coming away based on like you gonna talk provoking questions at the same time like [oh] my god you're a prostitute man you know you can have a you can have (uh) this kind of like
(uh) ya ya ya they asked I can't remember what the questions were
(uh) fundamentals one thing and then there's also like you know the typical questions that people would
ask when they're venturing more into the
into the religion without any guidance it's more of like (um)
one of the basic ones was why are there so many like why do bad things happen to good people kind of random things ya
so but like more in depth [lah] so like for him like want to provoking <malay>macam hati dia macam</malay> #dup# #dup#
(uh) <malay>kalau solat saya kentut bila rakaat ni</malay>
yes it is idiot
so okay so #tup# #tup# they ended up getting married
yes
I know I know done with the question about everything so (uh) he was looking for her
everywhere like <malay>dia punya dekat jalan</malay> and they met and they dated
[a'ah]
ya because she didn't want to be found out so she <malay>tergesa-gesa</malay> but the she just
ya ya I think some of them he didn't address on the spot cause he didn't know how to answer
so he was like (um) like between a couple of weeks or two three weeks he kept taking all these anonymous questions that are very different answer
know who so when he found out he was like [oh] my god I need to find this girl and he really went down to the neighbourhoods to find her so I was like okay [lah] when I watch this okay fine this one can I can brain everything (um)
but the the ridiculous part was when they got married
and she suddenly like not suddenly she seems like a very patient person but it's <malay>tak masuk akal</malay> the level of patients and the
[ha] it's very unrealistic I feel like people will have broken at some point
she could have
I mean (um) the way that the mother
the mother mother-in-law was treating her also
ya but I have to say that it was somehow the better ones
my favourite like most ridiculous malay show that I watched was <malay>cinta si</malay> wedding planner
with (uh) starting #mira filzah# and if you know #adi putra#
so okay okay nope the most ridiculous parts was when first #mira filzah# was twenty four seven
okay not twenty four seven but she was like full time when she's outside so there'll be like bedroom scenes okay not bedroom bedroom but she's chilling and then <malay>kat rumah</malay> and she's about to sleep and she's wearing <malay>tudung</malay>
or she's sleeping in her <malay>tudung</malay>
ya
and I'm like you know we can do without these scenes if it's
so difficult [lah] logically
yes yes
ya that's why like
it's it's so weird
correct you know the first
like her head [ah] [ah]
or like maybe not the not the you know the <malay>nenek-nenek</malay> kind
the instant [ha] instant I'm like okay I get it
realistically this does not make sense
ya that's why
which also brings me to that stupid (um) commercial shampoo commercial
<malay>dia cuci rambut tapi dia pakai hijab macam</malay>
[ha] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
