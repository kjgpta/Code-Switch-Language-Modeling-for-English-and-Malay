<malay>tak kasi dia keluar</malay>
(uh) (uh)
but I mean like that's a story for another time
but like ya so basically [kan]
for my boyfriend right it's like his
family don't know that he got boyfriend you know [eh] he got girl friend you know
(uh) (uh)
(uh) so <malay>mak dia</malay> [jer] <malay>tahu</malay> (uh) (uh)
<malay>sebab dia tak rapat dia cakap</malay> he doesn't even talk to his brothers that much then never really go out then I'm like does your brothers know then like ya
<malay>tapi kita berbual sampai malam-malam</malay> then every time he'll be like I think my brothers sus me already
then I'm like <malay>kalau tahu tahu</malay> [lah]
(err) I mean he's not keeping it secret he just never tell them [lah] I think he bit awkward to say
ya not he second child
<malay>sama anak kedua</malay>
(uh) (uh)
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya <malay>sama</malay>
(mm)
(mm) (mm) so far <malay>takde</malay> #alhamdulillah# like also because right
that's one second child is one right and then after that like even before we dated [ah] I like check a bit [lah] then you know my horoscopes right even the horoscope was like was a good match zodiac was also was good match
then I'm like !wow! what is this compatibility
so okay so him and he is leo and I'm saggitarius
so like I read up that it was like (uh) <malay>macam satu</malay> adventurous and then <malay>satu lagi</malay> practical like <malay>bila sama-sama dia bagus</malay> and <malay>dua-dua macam bara api gitu jadi macam</malay> passion <malay>gitu</malay> [lah]
I don't know [ah] I don't know <malay>belum lagi</malay> [ah] so ya so ya but I forgot our I forgot our chinese zodiac
but then I read up that it was like also compatible [lah] like when you put these two together right nothing bad can happen kind of thing
I'm tiger (uh) (uh) but I forgot his
<malay>api</malay> [jer] [eh]
[ah] <malay>tapi tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>garang sangat</malay> [kan]
(mm) (mm)
ya that's why
(mm) (mm) I think it will take at least one year [sia]
at least
to <malay>betul-betul macam</malay>
be sure that yours are okay with each other
ya
(mm)
true
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) uni year one
I <malay>macam lagi dua ke tiga gitu I pun terlupa</malay> around there [lah]
I don't think so
I think so [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> I think his is at most four years <malay>gitu</malay>
electric engineer [eh] electrical engineering [ah] <malay>gitu-gitu</malay> [ah]
(uh) <malay>tapi</malay> like
he was telling me also [lah] like he don't really know what he wants to do with his life <malay>gitu</malay> so <malay>takde</malay> direction <malay>gitu</malay> so he say he want to go for course counselling I say okay go go go go go good good good
because he
thought that (err) because <malay>dia punya</malay> poly <malay>punya</malay> course <malay>takde</malay> exam
so he thought maybe <malay>ada</malay> exam <malay>lagi senang gitu</malay> then he thought like maybe like even without <malay>macam</malay> passion he can still <malay>macam buat</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> survive <malay>gitu</malay> but then apparently he's like not surviving very well
[a'ah] that's why that's why ya so
he was like maybe I should go career counselling then I say ya ya you should go you should go
ya but then he say he finish exam first [lah] <malay>sebab besok dengan besok besok ada</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> exam
ya
exam [ah]
I think so
(mm)
ya [lah] might have to [lah] but honestly like I'm okay like
if you ask me I say go ahead [lah] <malay>macam</malay> if you find something that you like and you really find something that you want to do that's even better than suffering for
like (uh) (uh) three four years [seh] (uh) (uh)
correct exactly my point it's it's like
I rather you do something you want to do [lah] if you ask me but he is already telling me like !wah! I don't want to feel like I wasted my time to but I'm like I would rather you do something you like honestly
[ah] <malay>baru</malay> twenty five [seh]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)

that he like <malay>suka</malay> and he wants to do like research in the industry <malay>gitu</malay> but he don't know where to start and how to get there <malay>gitu</malay>
(mm) (mm)
there's some game game design or some like that okay [ah] so that means at least he has a
(mm) (mm)
[oh] because he said very expensive [one] and then he said
(uh)
very difficult or something like that
ya
is good it's good good ya

(uh) (uh) that's what I told him also like that's the first thing I ask <malay>macam asal tak pergi</malay> digipen like why not then after he say [eh] I got search for that
