really really long time <malay>semenjak aku</malay> last <malay>jumpa</malay> you right so how long do you think <malay>kita dah lama tak jumpa</malay>
no I think <malay>kita tak jumpa</malay> for quite some time I
it's way before COVID so COVID started last year right (err) last year when do you remember <malay>bila dia</malay> start
COVID <malay>bulan sebelas</malay> COVID <malay>bulan</malay>
okay COVID november ya so I I definitely did not see you this year at all and now it's already december so <malay>dah lama gila</malay>
right
early last year you know what what I can remember from my memory <malay>aku rasa</malay> is that
<malay>aku baru balik daripada</malay> my overseas job I came back then after that I saw you with your wife then after that <malay>kita dah tak jumpa lagi</malay> for a very long time then suddenly the next news that I got from you is that
(err) my mum <malay>bilang aku yang nurul</malay> is pregnant was pregnant and then after that [eh]
it's time to go you should visit your brother he's is over there and he's going be a dad soon and <malay>asal kau tak jumpa dia</malay>

he's turning two this coming december so that is how long that I've not seen you
and the the irony is that you only live like two blocks away from me
and we used to be very very good friends <malay>semenjak kita orang kecil lagi</malay>
[lah] you know what I was actually like in my mind right I was thinking when was the last time <malay>kita orang jumpa</malay> I mean when was the last when did we first meet up
when we this did we first meet <malay>abeh kau nak berbual</malay> english <malay>pun dah susah</malay> [kan]
just after kindergarten okay no no no no no no no no no because if you remember correctly right for the longest time
(err) from my memory is that we went for <malay>apa</malay> [tau] performance ya you know that that was like some <malay>bengkel kanak-kanak</malay> or some do you know remember <malay>aksi mat yoyo</malay> when we used to be there was remember that show <malay>aksi mat yoyo</malay> it's an entertainment for kids kind of a variety show and then we
(err) we met up at <malay>mak long punya</malay> okay so <malay>mak long aminah suriga</malay> is the like the producer for those kinds of (err) shows in entertainment right
let's put it the main woman yes <malay>pasal dia</malay> it's a woman ya I don't know whether she's still alive I hope that she is you know

a mini stage where she you know it was in like her I don't think that is her living room her house her flat was quite big
then <malay>kita orang</malay> and the stage was in between the living room and the kitchen yup remember that right
ya so <malay>aku</malay> I remembered that [ah] <malay>kita</malay> start performing and then after that we became friends
because our our parents are friends not parents our our mums are <malay>kawan baik</malay>
<malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> how they became friends [eh] yes because okay you know what let's let's not talk about that because okay maybe we can ask them later it's about us because we have not been catching up and and we we start from where we first from where I first remember
when I met you <malay>dulu</malay>
<malay>rumah mak long</malay> correct so we started dancing and then we did a few shows <malay>dekat</malay> (err) <malay>bengkel kanak-kanak punya macam</malay> performance and then I remembered doing shows <malay>kat situ</malay> with my sister <malay>dengan</malay> your sister <malay>dengan</malay> you together so it's #sriwana# yes yes you see now it's all coming back
ya lots of memories there but very (err) blur
vague
cloudy ya ya you can use the word cloudy because it's (err)
ya it's
cloudy is dark
yes I think <malay>kita orang</malay> were quite active in performance because I remember (um) quite vividly there was this particular show <malay>kita orang semua nak kena</malay> remember that that song old mcdonald's had a farm
old mcdonald's had a <malay>kebun</malay> is it <malay>kebun</malay> in malay
yes so that song goes like old macdonald had a farm right so
ya
<malay>engkau ada topeng</malay> [lah] but I do not have a <malay>topeng</malay> so what I need to do was with my face bare out in the open I need to because <malay>lembu</malay> [kan] <malay>ada</malay> horns right so I need to be a <malay>lembu</malay> with horns so what I did was during the song of (um) old mcdonald's had a farm while everyone was wearing <malay>dia orang punya topeng</malay>
I had to stick out two of my bloody pointy fingers and put it on my head and pretend I'm a cow that was really traumatising for me [lah]
yes ya
ya but at the same time I was very you know as a as a kid right the the thought of being embarrassed is not
there yet you see
<malay>kita</malay> happy go lucky just go with the flow <malay>mak cakap apa kita buat</malay> then after that <malay>jalan jadi lembu taruh tangan kau jadi jadi lembu</malay> then just <malay>joget</malay>
in front of people

I remembered that then the next memory that I had quite vividly
okay make sure you don't that that memory don't okay [lah] the word is forget ladies and gentlemen (um)
<malay>lupa</malay> [ah] so (err) the next memory is <malay>bila aku dengan kau</malay> we were in your dad's car
<malay>baru balik daripada</malay> some performance that we had because we had a few of those performance right <malay>kat luar</malay> some [lah] community centre <malay>dulu dia orang cakap apa</malay> [ah]

right no no no continue no no no ya
yes it's definitely irritating and looking back at it right now <malay>kita dah tua ni</malay> [kan] it was very it was because it happened by (mm) ya so I'm not sure okay so your
this was another traumatising part (err) on my end
<malay>pasal</malay> your <malay>bapa</malay> suddenly <malay>pusing belakang</malay> then <malay>cakap</malay> can you guys stop it or not
so I was (err) you know I got quite scared of your dad <malay>daripada hari tu aku macam</malay> [eh] hi uncle
ya until now ya I respect him you know not because of that only because he he's your dad he's a old man all these [lah] and he's he's a he's a wonderful malay guy old chap yes <malay>aku rasa</malay>
I guess so ya I guess so
maybe <malay>dia bingit</malay> ya I mean we <malay>kita orang</malay> deserved it <malay>seratus</malay> percent we deserved it
[oh] ya [ah] we were kids we were
just stop [lah] like !whoa!
ya but you know
overall your dad is a wonderful person you know (err) I'm not saying anything bad about him it's just that <malay>nak bilang kau</malay> [jer] that was a memory [ah] ya your turn
right
(hmm) [oh] my god
I remember those moments of education <malay>yang aku tak</malay>
forced that's the word
really [oh] that was so sweet of you <malay>aku</malay> feel so (err) yes
yes <malay>aku terharu orang cakap</malay> so
really <malay>pasal aku kawan baik kau ke apa</malay>
you know what I felt the same way about you
<malay>engkau bukan seorang</malay> ya
[oh] I remember I know where you're going with this I <malay>aku tahu mana kau nak pergi dengan ini benda</malay>
and
ya I I I I that what that is another memory which is quite traumatising for me as well <malay>pasal aku ingat</malay> at that point of time [kan] you had a bike you had a bicycle you had a bicycle and that bicycle <malay>ada</malay> tank <malay>warna kuning</malay> it's a bicycle with a yellow colour tank then <malay>lepas tu ada</malay> seat <malay>kat belakang</malay>
<malay>untuk kau duduk</malay> then after that that bicycle <malay>kecil</malay> [tau] <malay>tapi mati-mati kita nak tumpang</malay> each other it's a chopper
what
[oh] my god I remembered
right
right (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
we ya
I remembered
I I I I try to describe it [ah] so so we burn the the matches right then after that we as okay we burn the matches we blow the fire out then after that we put it in our mouth so that the smoke will the yes the matchstick into our mouth so that the smoke will accumulate and then when we open our mouth it's as though we are <malay>tengah hisap rokok</malay> [ah]
then we were doing [oh] and you know ya that was
we were very very happy
right
[oh] ya
ya it it became like a campfire thing did we were we arsonists did we burn any <malay>macam</malay> dustbin <malay>tak</malay> [kan]
but
it [oh] ya yup yup near our house [ah] ya the one opposite our house <malay>kat rumah bawah</malay> block #farhan# if you remember correctly
yes I remember that part also and another thing which I also remember was that (err)
brother john
<malay>salah</malay> brother love
no
love
brother brother love
john J A B C D E F G H <malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya [eh] same [ah]
ya I <malay>aku</malay> understand what you are trying to say because for example let's say we meet someone right and then <malay>kita lupa nama dia</malay> and then after that <malay>nama dia apa</malay> then we will go through all alphabetically just to try and [eh] he looks like a john you know [oh] ya ya he is a john so we I I go through that thing also I believe <malay>apa</malay> [tau] [lah] like they did (err) they did a study about this <malay>dia orang cakap apa</malay> [tau] <malay>siapa yang dulu</malay> (um) <malay>buat</malay> show <malay>dengan mak long gitu</malay>
(mm) <malay>siapa siapa</malay> the kids that <malay>buat</malay> show <malay>dengan</malay> #sriwana# so they have that it's in it
I think we should say thanks to her ya if (err) if you know like if I get to see her [eh] <malay>mak long</malay> hi remember me she probably wouldn't <malay>pasal</malay> ya
ya you can say that I have a <malay>janggut</malay> it's okay because I I saw you staring at my <malay>janggut</malay> and <malay>aku</malay> realise <malay>yang kau tengok dengan macam</malay>
right
okay
you
I mean you are very positive
ya ya I mean like to continue the whole <malay>janggut</malay> thingy if you want to stick to the topic like for a while if you do <malay>kalau</malay> if you don't mind <malay>janggut ni sebenarnya apa</malay> [tau] if for me [kan] <malay>aku punya janggut ni sebenarnya aku ni pemalas</malay>
<malay>aku malas</malay> (mm)
ya because I realise <malay>bila kau malas kau jadi gemuk</malay>
<malay>kau tak keluar janggut kau jadi gemuk</malay>
ya but <malay>gemuk</malay> is okay because you know (err) I I don't mind but
what
right right right right right I I feel that I feel that you are trying not to raise up that that that whole thing about you know fat people are lazy or whatever ya I (err)
yes (err) I mean my mum is quite
fat and I love her and my dad loves her very much you know (err) ya she's been quite fat for
quite some time
(mmhmm) okay (err) I remembered when we we went to primary school together right we went to #xishan# primary school together which is in #yishun#
like I am one year younger than you if <malay>kau ingat betul-betul aku sebenarnya aku sebenarnya muda engkau setahun tapi muka</malay> [jer] <malay>nampak macam</malay> ten years older from you and of course <malay>aku punya</malay> attitude is very mature
bye
right
(err) yes and vice versa so every year we will go through that thing so we seldom see each other <malay>kita akan jumpa</malay> each other <malay>bila</malay> (err) <malay>macam nak balik sekolah</malay> so <malay>kau kau balik sekolah aku baru nak pergi sekolah dengan</malay> thing sometimes
you know that kind of thing so
[oh] no
okay okay I I try to I try to from my memory [lah] because I'm one year younger than you so I probably have a bit more okay so (err) what happened was (err) after primary school [kan] <malay>pergi</malay> secondary school <malay>tapi aku</malay> went to a
secondary school which is quite far away from #yishun# you see I went to saint andrew's school (err) which is located <malay>dekat</malay> #potong pasir# so <malay>jauh</malay> [ah] saint andrew's <malay>kat</malay> #potong pasir# so saint andrew's <malay>dekat</malay> #potong pasir# (err) <malay>aku</malay> had to do my early journey blah blah blah while you were just you know like early journey to go to school because school [kan] <malay>mula pukul tujuh setengah</malay>
I have to wake up every morning at five or five thirty <malay>pagi</malay> then after that make my way to school by taking the or the bus so I start my journey probably around <malay>pukul enam pagi sampai sekolah tujuh setengah</malay> then after that
ya
normal timing correct so during that point of time we <malay>jarang jumpa</malay> each other because I was busy with my school and then you were lucky enough to go to a school which is
<malay>dekat dengan kau punya rumah</malay> so which is northland secondary school
see how lucky you are and you are living in (err) your your place right is located whereby it's
it's the view is wonderful from your house right the the view is wonderful from your house because (err) there were fields there were schools around it there was no flats blocking <malay>kau punya pemandangan</malay> [kan]
warning sign [ah]
that what you must be like <malay>terkencing dalam seluar</malay> [eh]
confirm <malay>kena rotan</malay> with your mom confirm <malay>kena rotan</malay> with your mom I remembered because your mom is (err) your mom is very strict (err) woman from <malay>bila aku pergi rumah kau pun mak kau pun macam</malay> quite (err) (err) how to say how should I put it [eh] verbal
ya she's she's fine with me I I I I actually you know what I I love her until now because <malay>sampai sekarang mak aku dengan mak kau masih</malay> best friends you know I mean I mean not as close [lah] because age and all this perhaps you know then after that you know like all almost all relationship goes I mean you tend to fade away and then after that <malay>datang balik</malay> fade away <malay>datang balik</malay> but I I appreciate the
the connection still
you know until now because you know in fact tomorrow is my <malay>mak aku punya</malay> birthday ya and guess how old my <malay>mak aku</malay> is
<malay>mak aku</malay> is sixty six years old [lah] that is (err) there's quite a that's quite a an old age sixty six years old you know
so yup
and
your father because I think we did have this conversation
(err) at one point of time
like you know what I remembered that we actually bumped into each other for for <malay>bulan puasa punya</malay> time
<malay>bulan puasa punya</malay> time remember we went for during ramadan we went to the mosque I think like once or twice we bumped into each other so we did catch up but just a very short time it's it's nothing like this
yes either that or <malay>kita pergi sembahyang jumaat</malay>
yes so we did [lah] but not not not for a very long time [lah] <malay>sekejap aje kita lepak</malay> then after that (err) I bumped into your dad
(err) he went to the friday prayers yes so I bumped into him and I said [eh] uncle (err) how are you because your dad always speaks in english then <malay>mak kau berbual melayu</malay> so you have that that that both thing right so then after that
[oh] ya ya ya my dad also [lah] my dad also speaks english
[ah] then after that (um) ya so (um) your dad <malay>aku jumpa dia</malay> then after that (err) you did ask me this question before [eh] <malay>bapa aku umur</malay> seventy almost almost eighty years old <malay>kau cakap gitu dengan aku</malay> then <malay>aku ingat macam</malay> [eh]
are you sure your dad is almost eighty years old <malay>kau biar betul dia nampak macam muda</malay> [tau]
like around my dad's age [ah]
mid seventies right so that makes sense you know when you say <malay>bapa aku tak tahu bapa aku umur dalam lapan puluh tahun kau biar betul</malay> your dad doesn't look like you know that ya because he's actually strong you know like he looks alright he doesn't look frail and he still you know he he's still can function as a old man
same bro but not my dad [lah] my dad will exercise <malay>tapi bapa kau keluar rumah ke</malay> he should be at home or <malay>dia keluar rumah</malay>
as in to to do his exercises right
amazing <malay>macam bapa aku juga</malay> my my dad will wake up like early
and he will do the the simple exercises with the stretches no I I did introduce him to yoga but I I don't think he's interested in that
but <malay>tapi</malay> you know looking at him stretching <malay>aku rasa</malay> he is still you know quite active in that sense <malay>pasal sekarang</malay>
(err) during on his birthday right two years ago I think <malay>aku belikan dia basikal</malay> for his birthday present then <malay>sekarang baru nampak tu basikal keluar</malay> as often
ya he starts to like cycle so
like I'm actually happy for him you know because
ya rather than to just stay home watch blah blah blah you know it's better to be active outside especially when you are old you know especially the government right now [kan] <malay>dia orang dia orang kasih</malay> (err) facilities for the old people <malay>untuk dia orang</malay> workout
correct ya yes correct correct so (err) what happened was speaking about this right my my dad retired so what happened was that he got bored and then he decided to <malay>masuk</malay> class [ah] join a class <malay>yang</malay> singapore <malay>punya</malay> funding
I forgot what is it called future or something like that skillsfuture ya so <malay>dia orang ada</malay> this skillsfuture <malay>punya</malay> thing so my dad got interested so he sign up for some (err) security course so ya so
I guess I mean
for his retirement he would probably be you know one of those security guards <malay>bila kau nampak kat</malay> condo then after that [eh] uncle how are you
okay [lah] same same [lah] like yesterday also <malay>takde ubah sama aje</malay> like that [lah]
ya so (um) (um) he will be one of those and hopefully he be going strong you know like for a few more years [lah]
ya rather than to stay home then after that you know waiting for my mom to scream at him
what do you mean
is this your transition to talking about music are we done talking <malay>pasal kita orang punya</malay> growing up in stages are you sure you want to go down that road [lah] <malay>sekarang</malay>
<malay>asal</malay>
ya
yes yes that's a good segway actually because (um) I mean it it still sticks with me I mean like most people I guess they are you know they love music right so just like us you especially <malay>pasal aku</malay> realise <malay>engkau sampai sekarang masih macam</malay> (err) doing gigs touring and all these do you still tour do you still <malay>buat kau punya</malay> music <malay>semua</malay>
ya
(hmm) okay (err) is it it's due to the whole COVID <malay>punya</malay> situation <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan]
[oh] you do (err) facebook <malay>punya</malay> session like live <malay>punya</malay> session is it [oh] that's cool you know what I found out that (err) one of our friend's <malay>apa ni</malay> boy #cazly# because I did meet up (err) met up with him the other time which was like maybe a month back somewhere around that time [lah] so <malay>sekarang dia</malay>
when we hang out that time <malay>dia cakap dengan aku yang dia baru buka</malay> a new studio where he will do live recordings and he will pay he will post it on facebook as in for live show I
believe it or not I do not have a facebook <malay>punya</malay> account I am not a
not say active [lah] like I am not interested in the whole thing I I I don't know maybe because I'm like you know I like it's weird because okay
it's weird because everyone is in it everyone is in the whole social media thing and you probably get to know information or I mean like current situation information <malay>daripada</malay> you know the social media but <malay>untuk aku</malay> I
I don't get my information from there I go to the news I direct news and all this
more reliable that one is more reliable but at the same time <malay>macam</malay>
the reason why I do that is just <malay>tak banyak sangat</malay> information coming in from left to right too many points too many (um) you know opinions from the social media <malay>dia punya</malay> community
so I don't and as as you know I'm quite introvert also
am I ya I think so ya I'm quite introvert ya so ya because ya I I rather you know
I rather be alone
and I'm not lonely !wow!
<malay>tak</malay> I don't know <malay>kalau</malay> does that make sense to <malay>kalau aku cakap</malay> I I like to be alone and I'm not lonely (hmm) do I have an imaginary <malay>kawan</malay>
no no no
ya I mean but
why
okay so like basically just to be updated <malay>dengan dia orang</malay> [ah]
so what you're telling me that you have like (err) you have you are talking about facebook right okay so <malay>dalam kau punya</malay> facebook <malay>tu</malay> you post like funny funny things
right
but
ya I ya you know what I definitely one hundred percent
let's even up it a bit more hundred and ten percent agree with you <malay>pasal engkau</malay> I I I realise I mean knowing you as a friend for for a very long time you are very positive (err) person <malay>seseorang yang</malay> positive [lah] <malay>senang cakap</malay>
you know and you are always smiling you always happy and I don't understand that about you sometimes
because how can this guy <malay>selalu macam gembira ke sana ke sini ada</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> funny and nice things to talk about you know nothing dark nothing you know like for me if you were to sit a little bit longer I will start you know coming out with a conspiracy theories and all this
<malay>kelakar seram kadang-kadang ada pontianak kat belakang</malay> whatever [oh] so then you know that that's just me but for you right I realise as a person and I really appreciate you for that for being that kind of person because ya <malay>pasal sekarang ni</malay>
you know there are a lot of (um) negative people out there especially you know if you look at comments in youtube I do go to youtube though <malay>tengok</malay> comment comments <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> video video guitar [lah] music whatever so there I will I like to read the comments because they are just
stupid and evil
at times
ya ya ya this is relative to <malay>dalam bidang kugiran</malay> music <malay>selamat hari raya kepada</malay> all the people in singapore
malaysians really why be careful [ah] [oh] what are you trying to say [lah] can you please be more (hmm)
(hmm) I'm not really sure about what you just said that like are you being truthful <malay>kepada diri engkau</malay>
actually <malay>aku pun aku pun suka orang</malay> malaysia [lah] but depends <malay>orang</malay> I mean individual you can be in malaysia you can be in somalia you can be in wherever country africa whatever whichever continent is that is you as a person <malay>macam mana kau</malay> treat <malay>orang tapi orang</malay> malaysia <malay>pasal aku ada banyak sedara</malay> my uncles my aunties in malaysia yes
my mother is from #penang# my mum is from my grandmother is originally from thailand so what happened was that (err) <malay>dia orang</malay> fell in love then after that my grandmother and my grandfather (err) ran away <malay>dia orang lari kahwin lari</malay>

under a tree <malay>bawah pokok</malay> then after that <malay>balik lari pergi ke</malay> #penang# for them to get married
so they got married they set up a house he became a policeman blah blah blah then after that he had I think like nine children
you know because at that point of time during the olden days they liked to have so many children I don't know why you know there was no control so my mum was apparently I think she's like number five or something ya
she's like the one of the middle child
okay
rewind
wait let me get it straight <malay>nenek kau punya kakak</malay> which is your
grand aunty [ah] yes
!wow! that is <malay>banyak anak untuk tujuh belas</malay> is a lot of kids [lah] <malay>tujuh belas</malay> is that's like a that's a factory plus reserves ya plus reserves !wow! what a woman !wow! so this is your grand aunty right

let's not get into let's talk about music let's stay above water level and talk about the music that I'm listening to <malay>macam apa yang kau berbual tadi</malay>
yes the the the punk (err) phase of our life
how did I get into the current music that I'm listening to well okay how did I get
roughly (um) you know (um) (err) as you know I'm working from home right now right so <malay>aku ada banyak</malay> time <malay>kat rumah</malay> then I could been listening to no at first I bought a I bought a guitar I don't know guitar <malay>apa nak beli</malay> you know this is this is a typical (um) you know typical if if people were to hear my story it will be quite typical because
why would you know like a mid life guy have a buy a guitar at this age you know right why what's up it's just <malay>pasal aku ada banyak</malay> time and I just want to pick up a new hobby yes no it's okay
yes
yes [lah] as you know <malay>aku dulu main</malay> drum <malay>asal</malay> it suddenly it's all about me now let's talk about you why I why do I feel that I'm interrogated [oh] ya you do
right
<malay>yang penting kau</malay> terror !wow! that should be that should be your next (err) malay album <malay>punya yang penting kau</malay> terror
<malay>dengar</malay> [lah] <malay>kita orang punya</malay> record <malay>baru</malay> which is called <malay>yang penting kau</malay> terror
ya <malay>dan sekarang aku main</malay> guitar and I have to say that I actually am not good at it even after like a year of learning it it takes a lot of dedication <malay>nak kena</malay> invest <malay>kau punya</malay> time <malay>main</malay> guitar and you and I I have to say I start I started quite late [lah] I started quite late then after
I when when I get to know you again during the secondary school <malay>punya</malay> time at the point of [kan] <malay>kau dah</malay> start <malay>main</malay> guitar you know and all this <malay>kau dah</malay> start <malay>main</malay> cranberries <malay>kau dah</malay> ya you you were playing like bar and not not like full chords you know full guitar chords which sounds amazing
you know and <malay>aku pula</malay> when I was in saint andrew's school [kan] <malay>aku belajar</malay> drums so after that then we at one point of time we started a band together then you then <malay>bila kita masuk</malay> band together we had a few of our friends then <malay>kita masuk</malay> a few competitions which I mean not to brag but we got you know
<malay>yang penting kita</malay> terror yes just like your the name of your future album
yes correct so
talking about drums right you were talking about drums is it
guitar right [oh] sorry
(mm) that's that phase of my life
ya yes <malay>pasal</malay> okay (err) the reason why I got myself into the whole which is electronic dance music <malay>pasal</malay>
at that point of time <malay>kita orang punya</malay> band <malay>dah tak ada lagi</malay> then after that <malay>kita orang</malay> decided to go our own way separate ways then everyone was you know you know leading their own lives <malay>gedebak gedebuk</malay> so I got lonely as I usually would and I started listening to (um) dance music
some techno <malay>punya</malay> stuff some (err) defected (err) record stuff which is quite cheesy [lah] to be honest with you like (err) they they call it tech house tech house so tech house is just like fall on the floor <malay>punya</malay> beats <malay>macam</malay> that kind of music so (mm)
so <malay>aku dengar</malay> (um) techno <malay>aku dengar</malay> tech house then there were few other house <malay>punya</malay> genres [ah] so they they had (err) like like like different
genres like sub genres [ah] within that that genres so I listen to specifically <malay>macam</malay> tech house deep house that kind of thing so (err) it got quite deep and then after that I started listening vinyl so I saved up money got myself a turntable then after that
(err) I had a I had a good friend who used to listen to vinyls as well so we got into it together then we started then after that <malay>kita orang dapat</malay> a few gigs <malay>kat</malay> #sentosa# <malay>dapat main kat</malay> club <malay>gedebak gedebuk</malay> we had fun but to be honest with you that kind of music I mean like yes it's we were growing up you see then it
in my in my perspective at that point of time I was like doing it
(err) because because right
the music is still strong I loved the music actually I love the whole production aspect <malay>kalau nak buat</malay> music <malay>tu</malay> I prefer to do that rather than to listen you know rather than to be a and to mix like
a a disc jockey <malay>dia orang punya kerja ni</malay> is to mix (err) <malay>satu lagu dengan satu lagu</malay>
so <malay>dia tak ada</malay> stop [ah]
right correct
yes for so for example <malay>macam ada satu lagu</malay> if he's playing in turntable A right so that <malay>lagu</malay> belongs to an artist correct so from my (err) end of it I would like to produce my own track I I would love to have my music in the in the playlist
in a playlist you know because the whole thing about
(um) or house music or that point of time it's just to get the the whole flow the whole energetic flow of dancing you know of having fun in the dance floor
<malay>macam gitu</malay>
(err) I would
<malay>lagu</malay> original it's preferable [lah] you know you know that's the reason why like <malay>kalau nak</malay> have a band to play (err) like cover song I mean you can do that but you know it's like practising is like practising other people's song when you have (err) you you know you have your own creativity right you want to express it and you have to want you want to create something on your own so <malay>aku rasa</malay> that is the part where you know we have our own band kind of thing
remember when we had our band we were playing other people song and then <malay>kita orang nak kena macam belajar dia orang punya</malay> chord <malay>belajar dia orang punya</malay> style of music
correct (err) back then yes (err) but
in that kind of genre [lah] in that kind of context (mm) ya I mean the whole thing for me <malay>aku rasa tak</malay>
although I did that for quite some time you know I think I did that for probably around like ten years or something like that ya I was ya I was playing in like (um) in #sentosa# which is an outdoor <malay>punya</malay> outdoor like
(mm) not restaurant like a disco
disco discotheque <malay>mak mak cakap</malay> discotheque <malay>kau pergi</malay> discotheque <malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>pergi</malay> discotheque [ah] <malay>mak</malay>
ya like a pool party kind of lounge so I went to I I was the resident there for every sunday and then <malay>lepas tu aku</malay> manage to do my own company so I hooked up with (err) a friend of mine then after (um) together he was from america then we <malay>kita orang</malay> joined forces
(um) to create to have a company so we we brought a a brand which is from the brand is called (err)
[oh] my god how can I forget this
(err) <malay>aku rasa aku</malay> wait wait <malay>sabar sabar aku lupa aku lupa aku lupa</malay> that was quite some time ago (err) so we bought that brand then after that
we all hat candy hard candy so we brought that brand hat candy into in singapore then <malay>kita</malay> launched <malay>kita orang punya</malay> own party [ah] so then we had we fly in the we flew in their to play <malay>gedebak gedebuk</malay> then
ya it was fun because you know you get to create something even though I mean it's not music though that I created I created art not say I created I mean we we me and my friend we managed to bring in more entertainment (err) value to singapore which which is at the highest standard (err) at that point of time then <malay>kita orang</malay>
<malay>buat duit</malay> apart from that you know we (err) charged people at the door <malay>kita buat duit dekat dalam dekat</malay> bar
so we managed to make (err) money then after that it went on for for quite some time then after that things got sour I don't want to go into too much detail <malay>dalam tu</malay> then ya [lah]
(err) now I'm back in my room listening to some dirty blues and playing <malay>aku punya</malay> guitar
ya I've been listening to what got me interested with there's a lot of guitar driven bands
out there in the youtube world <malay>sekarang kalau kau tengok kat dalam</malay> youtube you know
even from back then [ah] radiohead [lah] you know you have your death tones you have your whatever band which is you know cool at that point of time so that has always been (err) you know I like that but I can't do that
