okay <malay>boleh</malay>
(err) I don't really like the avenger I mean I'm okay I'm neutral about it but I will not choose like which avenger I would be
more of like which avenger I like and it's chris hemsworth so it's a thor guy thor god ya
ya its a god okay so (err) but like like if you really
want me to
(um)
choose
I guess
(hmm)
wait avengers <malay>pasal apa</malay>
captain america <malay>tak nak</malay>
black widow don't want [oh] doctor strange is nice
is he part of is he part of it I want change to doctor strange then
yes
lock in
what will you be then
no I'm like thinking if there's any other avengers
who are like (err) rich as well
is there any
he can make it big you know
(um) (um) I mean
what do I like (oo) I like comedy [oh] damn [eh] (err) superheroes I won't say specific superheroes like not really like a group of it so <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> group <malay>macam</malay> a bit too much <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you don't even know who to focus on right so if you have to choose then it will be spiderman but only the toby maguire version I don't really like tom holland the character
one thing tom holland is
one thing okay
he's young so he really suits it but I feel like I'm much more (um) what you call this thing convinced by the portrayal of toby maguire as spider man is very subjective a lot of people will be debating about this
but I just feel like at the point of time your teenager he was out there
there was this other person also andrew garfield you know
ya so (um) he his portrayal wasn't as good as toby maguire
like there's a lot of (err)
<malay>dia macam</malay> a bit awkward
<malay>gitu</malay>
(um) so <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia cam kekok</malay>
so like the way that he act <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> half-hearted <malay>gitu macam dia nak tak nak gitu</malay>
I don't know whether you understand what I'm saying but
did you just see the the the one <malay>yang</malay> (uh) andrew garfield acted ya ya watch all spiderman exactly I think that's why I think it relates my life I don't know
I mean he does have the face of like
[oh] my god when was the last time
#mulan#
<malay>aku rasa</malay>

(um)
(mmhmm)
okay so <malay>kalau kita tukar penjara kita macam</malay> norway <malay>kau rasa boleh jalan</malay>
personality personally I don't think it works though cause like okay one thing capitalism
confirm <malay>ada banyak</malay> order in their own prison cell and and the fact that like in terms of like relapse I think like people will enjoy going prison because they know compared to singapore <malay>punya</malay> let's say (err) four room flat
amenities <malay>tak ada</malay>
(um) fridge
might not have the money to even buy groceries but in prison you have

(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] you went dark so fast
<malay>asal kau fikir gitu</malay> [sia]
ya
(mm) (hmm)
(mm) (hmm)
(mm)
sis we all struggling here [ah]
<malay>aku rasa</malay> at this point in time
at least we are doing something about it right
comparing to like our twenties <malay>kita tahu kita tak solat lima waktu</malay>
and we're in denial of it <malay>macam</malay> other time in the future I will change but at this point in time like now you flapping I mean that's how I feel like <malay>aku cuba</malay> [ah] <malay>solat subuh</malay> like <malay>susah</malay> [sia] <malay>nak bangun</malay> alarm clock blasting here and left left and right
<malay>aku bingit</malay> [sia] <malay>selalu adamnya</malay> ringtone [kan] it's like super loud I just take his handphone just like this is so damn annoying <malay>dia punya</malay> vibration <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>semacam</malay> [tau]
ya and then like mine will be like birds chirping
its more mellow so <malay>bila aku bangun macam</malay> like [oh] bird you know its much more
ya
compared to <malay>bodoh punya</malay> handphone
ya so like (err) ya so like now I'm like
as a wife and and someone because I I came across this Tiktok <malay>belajar</malay> [eh] so I came across this Tiktok with post (err) they were mentioning about like (err)
as a wife or as a as it either wife or husband then you have to like remind each other to so like because if not then that would be you know your your your #taiji# [lah] basically so it's wife
we call it
where's your flaws may seems like whatever that might
what you call the thing
my <malay>kesalahan</malay> right <malay>kesalahan aku</malay> it's not
on my husband's <malay>punya</malay> shoulder
my my <malay>kesalahan</malay> is all just like my fault but his is his but if I do something wrong and he didn't like <malay>tegur</malay>
ya then that will be his fault
ya
so like it's the same thing as wife [lah] so <malay>sebagai isteri kalau aku tak kejut dia untuk solat subuh</malay> part <malay>tu kesalahan aku</malay> [lah]
so <malay>aku macam</malay> like <malay>aku tahu</malay> [kan] husband <malay>aku tak bangun</malay> then <malay>aku bangun</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> so <malay>asal</malay> [kan] <malay>aku kejut</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> <malay>kalau dia solat ke tak solat</malay>
okay <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> but that's how my understanding of it [lah]
ya
ya so this husband and wife thing it's it's really like teamwork
I really feel it after a year [eh]
being wife
communication that would be my response
communication is key definitely
because
like time <malay>kau bertemu janji</malay>
<malay>kau fikir macam</malay> like [oh] [ah] <malay>aku nak benda ni tapi aku tak nak bilang dia aku nak benda ni</malay>
like you assume that the other person will know
and when you have this assumption and this hope and when the thing doesn't come then <malay>kau bingit sendiri</malay>
right so right you just have to communicate whether you like it or not whether it will hurt the person you can soften the blow yes but as long as you tell and communicate
and learn it the hard way
only when I met adam there I would I know the positiveness
the value of communicating
what do you mean
ya
ya
that was what I been saying
okay okay so yours is more of physical yours is more of like a (err) a tangible mine is
I would always say mine is intangible but mine is like
(err)
verbal understanding technically its intangible is more of like the vibe that you get from your husband or your wife
ya
yes I I do acknowledge what you say because that's how my husband is like <malay>kalau aku tak tunjuk dia cara-cara</malay>
[ah] <malay>kesayangan ke apa dia fikir macam</malay> [oh] <malay>aku tak sayang dia</malay> so like I have to sometimes show him make effort
well and he does the same to me [lah] but for me I I rather have him communicate like what he wants or what he doesn't want because I cannot just assume <malay>aku aku macam</malay> in a way <malay>macam</malay> a bit
boyish [lah] so I I didn't I I sometimes assume and I I I don't know what he wants [ah] so he have to communicate he's the girl in relationships basically [lah]
I think we both know that [lah]
so ya sometimes <malay>dia macam</malay> hint hint hint then <malay>aku macam</malay> like what is it that you want and <malay>dia dia macam</malay> he's the kind of person who says things this way and that way and then <malay>macam</malay> like cannot make up his mind his decision then <malay>aku macam bingit</malay> [ah]
ya so just tell me what you want [lah] so in a way communication works
[oh] <malay>kau kau tolong dia</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk hantar barang-barang</malay>
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) (mmhmm)
<malay>tapi lepas yang kau cakap dengan dia dia harus berbincang</malay> like <malay>perasaan semua</malay> then <malay>apa dia cakap</malay>
<malay>untuk kau kot</malay> the way that you say it
(mm) (mmhmm)
<malay>dia mat teruk</malay> okay
<malay>dia pakai baju apa</malay>
okay (mm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya ya as long [ah] you communicate really because like if you think like you want to run away
<malay>dia macam adalah</malay>
what's that analogy credit card emotional credit card take it as emotional credit card <malay>bila kau</malay> run away [kan] swipe
you you you run away now you deal with it later so <malay>nanti dia</malay> accumulate accumulate [ah] then one day #bam# [oh] spark fire
ya
Tiktok
[eh] <malay>dok</malay> Tiktok <malay>aku dah</malay> obsessed [tau] <malay>dengan</malay> Tiktok
ya
there is there I mean there is one
[oh] damn
[oh]
<malay>tapi itu tak pakai</malay> that kind of idea <malay>untuk</malay> business <malay>kau sendiri</malay>

<malay>tahu</malay>
<malay>tahu</malay> [lah] [hor]
<malay>tengah fikir</malay> life <malay>tu apa benda</malay>
<malay>lima tahun</malay> [siol]
[ah] (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>kau nak apa</malay>
side
[oh] [oh]
[oh]
<malay>jadi apa</malay>
UNICEF [ah]
[eh] <malay>sembarang</malay> [lah] [ah] you
[ah] [ah] that's the one
<malay>asal kau rasa kau takleh takleh dapat pula kau</malay> [kan] designer
what what was the question
did you google
initiate
how do you do
in your essays in secondary school
I know I know
<malay>kau</malay> repeat english [jer] <malay>tapi kau tak belajar</malay> [kan]
<malay>tiga kali kau lambat</malay>
think you should work on your timings
<malay>syabas</malay> girl
paper two <malay>ke</malay> paper one
[oh] <malay>yang macam</malay> compre <malay>sekarang lain</malay> [seh]
[a'ah] <malay>dia macam</malay> like [ah] <malay>dia ada macam</malay> paragraph <malay>lepas tu ada macam</malay> like (uh) (uh) (err) <malay>apa ni bukan</malay> fill in the blanks <malay>macam</malay> just blank blank blank <malay>kat tepi</malay> [tau] so <malay>macam</malay> in this certain line <malay>kau cari</malay> idea <malay>dia</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> like if the for example the word (err) the sentence is this is the is the whatever then error is the repeated [lah] the is just write there is
ya basically <malay>macam</malay> [eh] it's vetting <malay>kau</malay> vetting proof reading its a proof reading exercise I am so jelly they don't have summary anymore
short form
<malay>aku tak faham</malay> [sia]
<malay>ni semua ni</malay>
<malay>dia faham</malay> [ah] yes sir do you
<malay>entah aku nak tahu kalau macam benda-benda</malay> <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>dia boleh berbual macam</malay> singlish <malay>berbual macam melayu</malay>
hey Alexa <malay>buka anak metropolitan</malay>
<malay>jawapan dia semua macam melayu-melayu</malay>
funny though
sorry but (um) yes (err) in twenty twenty four by twenty twenty four all students will get a personalised laptop
yup
yup
so much girl
do you know about the new syllabus [oh] not syllabus like the new programme education program that we have right now
so basically (err) I'm not sure which year
since last year <malay>tak salah</malay> okay I know this year <malay>dah memang ada</malay>
so
<malay>biasanya</malay> sec one sec two sec three
will have their common test mid year and the year right
as of now they don't have such thing theory change
it's what we call with the assessment so they have three of them already four of them [eh] so they go by percentage okay some pop pop quiz pop project work
and <malay>apa-apa</malay> whatever small activity last one will be end of the year exam
so they only have one major exam at the end of the year and that's really really high percentage which is seventy percent
ya so <malay>kalau kau</malay> screw up technically <malay>kau boleh</malay> screwed up the first three but then <malay>kau tak</malay> back up and <malay>kau tak belajar ke apa</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tak faham</malay>
that's it [ah]
so I do not know whether it's actually blessing in disguise for some people
but is that they want to like <malay>macam</malay> lessen <malay>dia punya</malay>
a stress on kids which I don't know it kind of doesn't work [lah]
because I hear students say I stress
ya adulting
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
[ah]
its its definitely different [lah] cause (um)
<malay>camne nak cakap</malay> [eh]
it it has its own pros and cons like for both the old system and new system because the old system you have lesser weeks to teach and you have more time not more time you let's say we should because you need to set papers and they have exams you have mid year their contents they have mid year and they have end of the year
this time around I only have one end of the year so technically teachers need to set one piece of the exam and the rest is just like activity and it can be like presentation it can be group work pair work whatever work so all of this it's in to
to the free time I won't say free time <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia ada kerja mana ada kerja sikit</malay> it depends on how you see it
I don't know whether you actually understand where I'm coming from but (um) for me if you ask me which one I prefer
as a teacher
<malay>sebagai cikgu aku rasa aku suka yang lama punya</malay> because it's much more as in its more pro for teachers rather than the kids because the kids would be more stressful <malay>ada tiga</malay> major <malay>tiga</malay> exam <malay>tiga peperiksaan ada</malay> common test <malay>ada</malay> mid year <malay>ada</malay> end of the year
so it's much more stressful for them
but for teachers its just set papers
if you if you if the way that you set paper is very stressful then that's on you [lah]
but
for me is is still okay cause
<malay>aku ajar</malay> art [jer]
