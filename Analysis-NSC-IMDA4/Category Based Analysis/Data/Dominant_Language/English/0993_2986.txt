okay we can start talking now [ah] so first thing first let's remember the ground rules when we talk we cannot overlap each other
so one person talk then one person answer K okay so topic <malay>permulaan</malay>
okay I don't know what happen I was at home <malay>tengah keluar masuk bilik cari makanan</malay> as usual <malay>cari air</malay> then suddenly mama on the sofa scrolling her Facebook and then she say the #kranji# resort <malay>ni macam cantik</malay> let's all go stay for holiday <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>satu</malay> three day two night something like that
no she just ask like <malay>korang nak pergi</malay> farm stay <malay>tak</malay> I initially said no because it's at #kranji# and I always told her like <malay>nanti sana ada momok</malay>
I think so ya <malay>dia dekat dengan</malay> #sungei buloh# all the way [sia] I check on Google
actually I solve that problem already like yesterday (um) I went to research more [lah] like the the reviews of this place so I saw on tripadvisor that they spend like three hundred and eighty five dollars for one villa for one night it was very expensive and they said the place is so rundown <malay>abeh macam tak ada makanan</malay> and stuff like that [ah]
then there was another review I showed mama that this family had to spend like close to six hundred dollars because there was no food there so they have to go out and buy the barbecue <malay>nya barang</malay> barbecue over there so ya the review was like all one star one star one star those were pretty recent like ya yesterday it was seventeen eighteen november [kan] the review was on sixteen november just two days before
I told her fairmont is cheaper fairmont is only three hundred dollars per night then might as well go there then you have a halal food there also
!huh! <malay>sekarang</malay> hotel <malay>tengah macam</malay> staycation package <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]

<malay>makcik keropok</malay> has been going around for quite long [ah] I don't know when we moved to our house <malay>dekat</malay> #clementi# [kan] think I was in uni that time then there was this <malay>bibik</malay> indonesian who <malay>tengah jual keropok</malay> and then it was I think <malay>malam</malay> [lah] <malay>macam lapan lepas maghrib bibik tu ketuk pintu abeh tanya nak jual keropok</malay>
then mama <malay>tengah kat</malay> living room I open the door mama straight away jump up and then she started screaming like <malay>adik adik</malay> then the <malay>bibik kasihan</malay> [tau] the <malay>bibik</malay> was like <malay>saya bukan hantu saya bukan hantu saya betul-betul benar-benar mahu jual keropok gitu</malay>
then I was like I !alamak! <malay>mak aku tak baik</malay> [seh] <malay>dia terus</malay> panic <malay>gabrah depan depan bibik tu</malay> but I ended up buying a few <malay>keropok</malay> [lah] cause <malay>kasihan</malay>

<malay>sana tak ada macam</malay> like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
okay question what are your thoughts about the #changi# <malay>punya</malay> restaurant a three eighty thing where you pay money to eat the first class food in the airplane
mama wants to go for that actually
when the news came out she ask me <malay>adik</malay> do you want to go and eat at the airport the aeroplane there the first class mama <malay>nak</malay> try <malay>makan</malay> first class <malay>tak pernah duduk</malay> !alah! <malay>tak boleh</malay> fly [kan] <malay>duduk kat dalam</malay> aeroplane <malay>dapat makan pun jadi</malay> [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> so I told mama for the price that you pay [ah] I would rather save up the money and actually fly first class to somewhere than just sit there and eat
it was a couple of hundred
ya not worthy
ya and it's like when I look at the I watch videos of people who paid for it and go for it's like if you eat halal food you really waste your money because you are not gonna drink all the what dom perignon and all that
never let old people spend too much time on facebook and this is what happen
I remember like I I did say that out (um) mama did say that she want me to <malay>macam</malay> take them go <malay>jalan-jalan lain kali</malay> #daya# <malay>bawa pula</malay> [lah] because like the last time she went japan <malay>macam korang bawa dia</malay> [kan] so she said to me <malay>lain kali</malay> #daya# <malay>bawa</malay> [lah] <malay>kita jalan-jalan</malay> so I told mama
<malay>cara</malay> I <malay>jalan-jalan</malay> later you all don't like one good thing is I very relax so some days you can don't go out if you are tired but another good thing is I like to backpack and all these things stay in dorm you all must hotel then how ya
I was thinking of that too you know because dorm can cook [mah] mama can cook
but <malay>penat</malay> [seh] <malay>masa tu kita pergi</malay> japan <malay>banyak jalan</malay> so I don't think they would want to cook also I also don't want to cook the japan food very nice
but she eat #ramen# all that
<malay>sedap</malay> but the <malay>sedap</malay> is what the cook is malaysian cook [ah] or japanese cook
cause the food nice mama is one of the few people I know who likes aeroplane food
no for me personally I the only airplane food that is nice is like the qatar flight that's it the rest
we had a question what is what was the most memorable meal you've had and where did you have it sad to say it was on the qatar flight I agree
I never try <malay>nasi lemak</malay> on airplane before
really okay I should try
[oh] K K K ya
things to note <malay>nak kena</malay> try <malay>nasi lemak kat</malay> silk air important question <malay>nak</malay> fly <malay>tu bila tu</malay> !aiya! I hope they can find a cure for this COVID [seh]
sure can [lah] you know why not
<malay>betul punya</malay> travel bubble [eh] from one island to another island
that's a good idea write in [lah] write in to #lee hsien loong# [ah]
they got power [mah] he can phone call to the maldives government [what]
ya it's not mine also
(mm) okay
is it kenya
safari kenya tanzania [lah]
I think it's tanzania because of #serengeti# national park so that's tanzania but also can [what] because you just travel south kenya on top tanzania below [mah] I think I can take qatar then I will fly to qatar and then go down
there got flight
good [lah] I don't have qatar membership
leverage on your brother
he still very lucky [eh] he still like employed like
only flights to europe still ongoing that's what that's what I heard [lah] for for middle east to europe still ongoing like ya but reduce flights [ah] number of flights
[oh] ya [a'ah] <malay>orang semua nak balik negeri</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> relax <malay>dah</malay> [kan]
they're very smart
[oh] <malay>dah</malay> thirty minutes already
talking about our own life [eh]
[a'ah] still a lot of things <malay>juga</malay>
what's the name
#darwin# interiors
cheap
[eh] that's not bad
what what size resale
four room three room
[eh] not bad twenty six K
[eh] then they hack it out then outside is what <malay>kosong</malay> [jer] [oh]
<malay>aku yang tak ada rumah aku dah bilang pasal rumah aku</malay>
five more years but like a lot of things need to be done I realise [ah] like like you need to think about okay when you want to get your loan blah blah blah cause for me I don't think I want to buy a resale [lah] I want to get a because I like the flats but then the thing is I cannot get those I have to like find sale of balance
ya then I have to think about K sale of balance cause sale of balance usually <malay>macam</malay> reject reject <malay>punya kalau orang tak suka</malay> the areas [ah] the units [ah]
the units [ah] units
[ah] <malay>atas tong sampah gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>ada orang tak suka tempat tong sampah atau rumah punya</malay> fengshui <malay>tak bagus ke</malay> yang at least the good thing is <malay>tak ada momok</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> resale [kan]
<malay>yang tengah yang tengah</malay> have [lah] <malay>tengah</malay> have
ya actually ya I would so I was thinking of that also <malay>macam</malay> cause I saw like
on property property ninety nine I think ninety nine dot com the app <malay>tu</malay> [kan] so people who live in like edgefield plains <malay>kat kawasan</malay> #sengkang# they are pretty new and they were selling the house although house is quite cheap the house is actually still in good condition ya [ah] <malay>macam kau masuk terus dah siap</malay>
[oh] for sure
I want like <malay>macam</malay> cement floor <malay>macam gini</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> cement floor
yours is yours is porcelain tile [ah]
it look like <malay>macam</malay> cement <malay>gitu</malay> like concrete <malay>gitu</malay>
so I was thinking of something like this [lah] <malay>macam yang penting</malay> colour grey <malay>bawah tu</malay> look a bit like cement
<malay>korang ada</malay> skirting <malay>tak kita letak</malay> skirting <malay>juga</malay> [lah]
[oh]
because I was thinking that <malay>kalau</malay> if I move out to my own place I think I need to bring pluto along with me I told about mama papa I don't want to live alone so I confirm <malay>nanti bawa</malay> pluto <malay>sekali</malay> [lah] so I also think about [oh] if you want to have a house <malay>nanti</malay> pluto need her own cat tree [lah] you need to #catify# the house <malay>semua</malay> [kan]
so that's why I'm like thinking about what I want to do to the house and how much I must save there are people who spend like eighty thousand dollars on renovation <malay>abeh rumah dia macam</malay> minimalist <malay>gitu</malay> and it's eighty thousand dollars
cause I I don't want to like <malay>macam</malay> have a lot of build in I was thinking of just by IKEA furniture
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>si kecil tu dekat rumah cekau-cekau</malay> [jer] now the <malay>kayu-kayu semua nak terkopek</malay> so that's why I'm thinking like that [ah] <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] <malay>beli mahal-mahal beli macam murah kayu</malay> simple simple then IKEA [kan] <malay>macam batau</malay> furniture then after five years can throw already
they <malay>katuk</malay> very fast [eh]
a lot of <malay>macam</malay> renovation company <malay>mcam dorang katuk</malay> very fast
[oh] and she bought it when
three years

<malay>macam dia punya benda tu</malay>
!wah! bosch is supposed to be a good brand [what]
ya
underrated [ah] underrated brand
the good thing is that's why I thinking you buy cheap right so is like the thing about appliances nowadays they five years then okay must throw already or new technology already so I think buy cheap ya buy cheap or like you you have to do your homework [ah]
check reddit sub reddit groups singapore kitchens

<malay>tak dengar bunyi budak-budak</malay>
[oh] <malay>dorang</malay> alternate [kan]
try teaching [ah] <malay>macam mana nak</malay> teaching I like teaching I don't like you heard that I like teaching I don't like
but that's the fun part
teaching don't get holidays [meh]
[oh] okay okay okay <malay>faham faham</malay>
(mm) true [lah] then you don't have to contend with parents in whatsapp chat groups
that's why I really <malay>macam tabik</malay> [ah] those people who go teaching cause you you don't even have time to teach you spend more time on <malay>benda-benda remeh-remeh semua layankan</malay> parent <malay>layankan</malay> principal
kindergarten no I got no patience with <malay>yang kecil-kecil yang masih berak dalam seluar</malay>
<malay>yang kat luar tu semua habis</malay> [ah] <malay>pecah-pecah</malay>
[eh] <malay>bijak</malay> [eh] <malay>dia bijak</malay>
[oh] okay
that's cool
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau anak saudara sendiri</malay> okay <malay>tapi kalau jaga anak orang lain</malay> like in a school setting is different the kids have different values they come from different backgrounds <malay>kalau anak saudara</malay> at least the values are still similar you know <malay>kalau budak tu ada</malay> problem can always easy for you to speak to the parents
last resort
actually I do like teaching [ah] I mean I was giving tuition for like what almost a decade already then I realise that I do enjoy it [lah] I I enjoyed teaching when I was like at the science centre
different [lah] from a classroom environment [kan]
each project different different thing
that's a sad thing [lah] you still have to teach like the same content
<malay>dah hafal</malay> script [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
for me tuition was different okay like <malay>macam</malay> I know that the syllabus are <malay>ajar macam gini</malay> [kan] but with each kid they are at different at how should I say different <malay>macam</malay> not say education level like <malay>macam tahap kefahaman dorang</malay> is different so <malay>macam</malay> maybe in class the teacher already <malay>dah</malay> start on algebra but the kids <malay>punya</malay> foundation is still very weak so although <malay>dorang dah</malay> sec one and they are already doing algebra their understanding of maths is still <malay>macam</malay> at primary four primary five ya so
is a bit interesting [lah] for me like every single student is like a project different materials different way of teaching [ah] <malay>ada budak macam</malay> they really need [ah] physical experiment to really understand mathematical concept I mean as adults right when we look at maths we think <malay>macam</malay> is very straightforward one plus one equals to two but to a kid who has no understanding of what is maths at all [kan]
they will be like <malay>apa tu</malay> one <malay>kenapa</malay> one <malay>kenapa</malay> one plus one <malay>kenapa tak boleh</malay> one and that kind of thing
it's not stressful [leh] it's it's fun
actually it's not that hard I realise okay [lah] because for me (um) I teach budget tuition and I teach <malay>orang kita orang kita mak-mak dorang macam</malay> more or less <malay>macam</malay> [ah] relax [jer] <malay>kau datang</malay> class [kan] <malay>dia kasi epok-epok</malay> [lah] <malay>dia sibuk kasi kau makan dulu</malay> for them is I just want you to sit next to my kid and make sure my kid does his work
<malay>tu dorang punya</malay> (um) general generally [lah] most of them <malay>dorang punya</malay> mindset is like that there are a few <malay>macam</malay> one or two who come and they say like [oh] I want my kids to get A <malay>padahal</malay> the kid is already a B student so for me <malay>macam</malay> when I come in actually there's not so much work on my part it's just that I want the kid to be interested in learning once the kid <malay>dah</malay> interested in learning automatic <malay>terus dorang</malay> A <malay>sendiri</malay> so <malay>jadi tak</malay> stress <malay>macam gitu</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> stress is when you haven't start the parent <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>kepoh kepoh</malay> [lah] like you can you go through this for my kid can you look can you go through that for my kid [ah] <malay>macam gitu tu leceh sikit</malay>
<malay>ajar budak-budak madrasah</malay> [ah] <malay>madrasah</malay> kids were very very nice
but I feel so sad for them because when they share with me the school <malay>punya</malay> how the school life is right then I realise the quality of education is very different ya I had one like this student everytime I read it so one year is one older than the other take three the other one take two
so he was sharing that their maths teacher is the same teacher I think science teacher was the same teacher the teacher is like some <malay>makcik</malay> like very old lady who in the class will just sit down and talk talk talk talk talk talk so they don't understand what's going on in the lesson
I because <malay>madrasah</malay> under private school [kan]
but the kids are amazing nineteen subjects [eh] for O levels one nine
okay [what] <malay>al al-irsyad</malay> [ah] [eh] but <malay>al-irsyad susah nak masuk</malay> [eh]
<malay>sekolah tahfiz</malay> [ah]
[eh] but it's good you know because like I see like a lot of people who graduate from <malay>madrasah</malay> like [oh] my god they have like masters and double masters because nineteen subject for O levels is nothing you know they are doing two masters at university level is nothing is a longer route for them but even at thirty years old they're still doing like all these ya this is like nothing for them
[a'ah] [seh]
okay [mah] <malay>tak salah</malay> [pe] but I notice this trend [tau] <malay>macam</malay> my friends who are in education or their wife who are in education !wah! they really start planning the education route early on baby <malay>masih dalam perut dah</malay> planning [tau] <malay>nak hantar</malay> childcare <malay>ni lepas umur ni pergi</malay> this school <malay>nanti pastu hantar ni</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> we all <malay>orang biasa</malay> relax [ah] <malay>pergi sekolah</malay> good enough already [ah]
ya
like if I have kids it's just gonna be like just relax I will be like the general singaporean like your cert [ah] doesn't necessarily mean that you going to get a job that's very good I will be that kind of parent focus on the other things [ah]
then grow up to be farmer
have his own farm [ah]
as an adult I wanted to be a farmer I apply <malay>kat</malay> #kok fah# <malay>kena</malay> reject [seh] <malay>sedih</malay>
