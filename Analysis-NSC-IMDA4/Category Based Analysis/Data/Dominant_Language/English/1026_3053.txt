okay because night walks right what they did was that the line the route with glow sticks [tau]
they line the route with glow sticks then the
the like you are free to walk [ah]
<malay>kena</malay> like <malay>kena jalan</malay> [lah] <malay>macam dia orang tarukkan</malay> glow stick [kan] <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>dia orang apa tu dia orang bagi kau jalan dengan</malay> the first person <malay>kena pegang dia punya</malay> torchlight then <malay>yang belakang tu</malay> you know then <malay>macam kena taruk tangan atas bahu</malay>
caterpillar <malay>gitu</malay> [ha] I was usually either the first or the last one because I wasn't scared you know I'm not scared [lah] so but the weirdest thing you at what for some reason once [kan] what happened was <malay>aku tengah</malay> like everything was okay like it it started out fine
it started out fine but right it's like
like when how say [eh] (uh)
it started out fine but it's like (err) when we came back from like to go back to the campsite right
when we went to the camps when we tried to come back to the campsite [lah] so basically after the (uh) night the first mission night walk right then they had a briefing then <malay>tepuk</malay> [ah] something like that we walked back to the campsite that I somehow tripped tripped but I didn't really trip because it was
I was like walking normally you know like you know you walking normally right like are there was nothing for me to trip on or like off or something I felt like something grab my ankle then I slipped
but the what weird like <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>benda yang pelik yang terjadi</malay> [kan] actually <malay>selepas tu</malay>
like so basically [kan] like okay so I was injured so I I fell so I I sprained my ankle [kan] so <malay>yang dia punya</malay> faci <malay>dia</malay> [kan] the [eh] no a teacher wanted to take a shorter cut [lah] because I was injured right so they (uh) they brought three of us took the shorter cut by the time we <malay>sampai dia punya</malay> campsite [kan]
everyone was showered
everyone finished showering already
I don't know they they they were getting ready to eat <malay>apa tu</malay> supper [eh] ya then they showered already then one of my friends like (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> where where did you go [lah] right why you said I thought you take shortcut [oh] why you take so long [ah] I'm (uh) then <malay>aku macam</malay>
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [sia]
[kan] if you think about it because we took a shorter cut
I don't know I don't know it didn't feel very long it felt like it was short but the problem is when we reach everyone was either showered or the last few are showering you know that [kan] so you can you think do you like people shower you you get the girls and all <malay>lama juga</malay> [lah] [kan] [ha] <malay>lama juga</malay> so I was [oh] my god until now I can't figure out what happened but ya

<malay>kampung</malay> [sia] what I'm weird is one thing that is that in the hustle and bustle of the city
<malay>kubur melayu</malay>
<malay>macam kampung pula</malay> [kan]
no I think they know because I went to search up on you know where to visit you know we we always do those visits right and I was searching where to visit [ah] then I saw this one place they said <malay>kubur melayu tengah-tengahnya apa tu kat</malay> #bugis# <malay>juga</malay> I think
like beside that's why when the moment you said [oh] <malay>kat</malay> #bugis# right then I was like is it near the near the <malay>madrasah</malay> and when you said yes I know about this story it's quite famous [lah] I mean who would think

okay [lah] okay it was fine it was fine it was because you know you <malay>pergi surau</malay> you won't go alone [what] especially because I <malay>budak</malay> singapore [kan] <malay>mana orang nak bagi anak pergi sana</malay> especially because malaysia you know [ah] there's a lot of those cases right so

ya but I mean I shower because it was with my mum but imagine if I was I was alone I will not shower I don't know how my sister went to shower alone [oh] my god <malay>dah</malay> [lah] <malay>masa tu tengah ada</malay> case <malay>apa tu</malay> you know they <malay>masa</malay> that [one] is early two thousand still got case of <malay>apa tu orang minyak ke apa</malay> [kan] something like that
no they say that
<malay>pengamal pengamal</malay> they they they practise like magic no they <malay>amal</malay> it like

no I don't know I don't know [eh] I think I don't know [eh] is it I also don't know but I I still don't know the difference I only recently found out all the difference between <malay>langsuir</malay> and <malay>pontianak</malay>
LOL
[oh] <malay>yang nenek tu</malay> [eh]
<malay>bomoh</malay> [eh]
is it the <malay>makcik bomoh</malay> that [one] that episode
(uh huh) cause I watched that [one]
ya the one that the guy <malay>potong kuku malam-malam</malay> then the guy the other guy <malay>bukanya payung dalam rumah</malay> [kan] ya ya why what's your question
<malay>apa apa</malay> no <malay>penanggal penanggal lain</malay> do you realise it's the same thing because #nananggal# is the philippines term for <malay>penanggal penanggal</malay> is <malay>melayu</malay>
you will realise that okay you realise that a lot of the folklore right it's similar because we live in the same region you know if you check our genealogy [kan] philippines indonesia <malay>melayu orang orang</malay> singapore yes correct we are all basically the same ethnicities just that because of the you know the like they they split up and things like that !aiya! anyways but ya it's actually the same folklore [lah]
that's why you said lady in white right for us it's <malay>pontianak</malay> you were saying
(mmhmm)
<malay>cerita apa ni</malay>
[oh] one of the one of the [oh] it wasn't in the it wasn't in the [oh] ya ya ya ya ya the <malay>penanggal yang takde</malay> so basically the <malay>apa tu</malay> the organs that [one] right ya it's not a joke my dad used to [oh] ya you know I I did the interview right so basically (uh) for our interview for the coding in school right for class so my dad actually used to work for telcom
you know <malay>zaman dulu</malay> is <malay>yang apa tu tali dia</malay> hanging [kan] <malay>kat atas</malay> it wasn't underground like now [kan] ya so basically singapore [ha] <malay>kat</malay> <malay>kat</malay> malaysia <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>kat</malay> singapore [lah] so basically like <malay>apa tu</malay> they had to change <malay>dia punya</malay> lines <malay>kadang-kadang kalau kadang-kadang dia</malay> (uh) telephone <malay>lama dia orang</malay> [kan] <malay>rosak</malay> then he was one of the people who go and repair
ya it was [ah] it's technician [ah] electric <malay>punya</malay> technician so basically what happened was that you know if you <malay>tukar senja-senja</malay> you'll see sometimes the <malay>penanggal</malay> head will get stuck at the at the hanging lines
no how to say [eh] <malay>penanggal</malay> is not really <malay>macam</malay> it's not like <malay>hantu raya</malay> it's not like <malay>pontianak</malay> it's not dead [oh] it's practice they say [eh] they <malay>pengamal</malay> they like <malay>orang minyak</malay> [kan] <malay>amal</malay> black magic so it's like <malay>apa tu</malay>
[ha] they practise [ah] but I don't remember what was the reason I know I know (err) <malay>orang minyak</malay> is to be good looking or something
I don't remember I think he was ugly or something then he say that he wants to like he was sick of people making fun of him or something <malay>aku tak ingat</malay> right no no no he made a made a <malay>perjanjian dengan syaitan</malay> then to like to make himself look handsome LOL then that's called something called plastic surgery [sia] plastic surgery
but like I kind of understand because when you work with not <malay>bomoh</malay> [lah] but you work with <malay>syaitan</malay> right it's natural I guess I mean the fact that you don't have
it's not painful
it's not painful and I mean it hurts your soul but not on your face I guess (err) I don't know [lah] I mean #allahu alam# [ah] [eh]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>suka hati kau</malay> [lah] <malay>nak</malay>
that's why I say I don't know you go Google [lah] I don't know what else [ah]
[oh] <malay>dia nak makan anak dia</malay> I think
[oh] <malay>awet muda</malay>
to stay young
right I I remember I remember a lot of stories where they say that they eat babies to stay young
you know the story about the there are like people I remember one of the incredible tales and actually it happened if you I don't know if you notice but when people get (uh) malay people pregnant right they will put things under their what was it pillow put things at their <malay>tingkap</malay>
people correct
I guess it's kind of make sense but I mean if it was a follow [ah] they say that (err) they put because they are this one <malay>jin</malay> or ghost [kan] <malay>hantu</malay> [kan] that will actually steal the baby ya it's the same <malay>jin</malay> that you were telling me that day we were talking about that day I think
ya ya I don't want to talk about it who knows they're talking the thing will I mean I mean
scared the heck out of me they eat the ya the <malay>rahim</malay> they they eat the <malay>janin</malay> right they that's why they say [what] <malay>zaman dulu maghrib</malay> [jer] <malay>tutup tingkap</malay> then they then they will hang like <malay>paku-paku atau punya apa tu</malay>
<malay>garam</malay> kind of I don't know this I don't know for some reason <malay>garam</malay> is apparently quite useful in like islamic practices right they use it as border ya I don't know is that I don't know is that how my dad <malay>pagar rumah</malay> or not but ya
ya they say what is it [ah] what what <malay>daun apa</malay> also not <malay>ketumbar</malay> but they say LOL <malay>ketumbar untuk makan</malay> there's one <malay>daun</malay> they use to like <malay>apa tu</malay>
I don't know what's the name of the <malay>daun</malay> but it's like
ya I I they say that it cleanses something no I don't remember but if I remember I'll tell you but it's like ya they say it clean like <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh)
<malay>anasir-anasir sihir</malay> or something like that
no it's
islam
they said they use it for <malay>kalau orang kena rasuk ke kena rasuk kena apa tu kena hantar apa tu sihir ke</malay> they use the <malay>daun</malay> or something I don't remember this one <malay>daun</malay> they even sell <malay>sabun</malay> or like <malay>sabun</malay> because who want to buy <malay>daun</malay> and go and clean yourself
use it's the same idea as <malay>tanah liat</malay> you know so you touch pig or dog you can just wipe what ya technology ya
but ya actually a lot of the #jins# are quite chicken [sia] I heard a lot of people right need to be careful like you know people give birth right you don't know who the one who <malay>sambut</malay> the baby
welcome it I know when you give birth the one who will help you give birth midwife midwife I mean (uh) you hear stories that sometimes inside the
(mm) they see extra people inside the room when they
figure or figures of things like that because my mum said when she was pregnant with me right [eh] no not with me with my eldest brother she was disturbed quite a lot inside the hospital
taking it [lah]
I mean like I said [lah] the the the <malay>jin</malay> we were talking about this it eats (uh) it steals babies and things like that that's why they say [what] actually the the reason behind [oh] need to go back inside the house (uh) (uh) <malay>sebelum maghrib</malay> right
I don't know maybe
but then again there's a lot of deaths in hospitals also so (mm) I guess understandable never wanna become a nurse or doctor fuck no
(mm)
(mm)
can you imagine like maybe I don't know
I don't know
but ya you can you imagine the doctor when got nurse then <malay>sekali</malay> got extra nurse the one that <malay>sambut</malay> your baby [oh] no [oh] my god hell no because my mum says that it's very <malay>keras</malay> [lah] that's why I was so scared when I was hospitalised early this year I was like but then again new places also got things [what] everywhere got things [what] even talking about them right now confirm they'll be like [oh] they talking about me
I I told my mum if they're gonna like disturb me at my house also I'm gonna be like whatever I'm so tired I'm too tired I'm not getting enough
I don't I don't have I don't get enough sleep for me to deal with your bush
ya let me let me get some sleep first you come you you set appointment and you come back no because that time during I I
(ugh) two bad you don't you don't go to camp [sia] but that time when I was like red cross in brownies I always had camps right sometimes like when you too tired I don't know whether it's a hallucination or not but I'm pretty sure I'm not because what I'm the kind right once I sleep I like if world war three happens also I wouldn't wake up I will sleep even when a bomb drops ya <malay>tidur mati</malay> [ah] ya then like so basically what happened was that I was awake I woke up I was groggy but I was awake I mean I'm blind [lah] I wear specs [lah] but I was awake but I saw like something at the end of my bed like standing
I was looking at it okay <malay>baca apa kau aku baca pun kena kacau</malay> that's why
<malay>baca ke tak baca</malay> it won't stop me from getting disturbed
it prevents you get getting disturbed in your sleep but it's not when you are awake
different story it can go into your dream also [what] they say
that's why sometimes if you dream about something I don't know is it a like I mean a lot of like while (uh) psychological study said that [oh] it's just like (uh) was it what [seh]
<malay>khayalan menjelma</malay>
they said that if it's pigments about fragments of life brought into your dream or something then they intensifies it or something but then again some dreams are so wild that you are ya that you can't help but to think
is it but then again when you hear about like I see like all the <malay>syarahan-syarahan</malay> they say actually <malay>jin</malay> can <malay>apa tu</malay> manipulate your dreams things like that even when they actually disturb you they can't touch you they can only manipulate your mind right
like you said [what] they can (uh) what is it [ah] they can show themselves to you or make themselves shown or something they manipulate your brain so like you think you see them
ya but then again right I feel like
I think rather than <malay>hasutan</malay> right if they can insert images in your brain when you're sleep right they can do the same when you are awake [what] ya so basically it's not exactly <malay>hasutan</malay> but it's more of because <malay>hasutan</malay> are words right they play with your mind ya definitely even when you see (err) like english like like american horror movies or things like that if you realise that most of it is just ya they play with your mind
it's because there are it's aiming you
but you know what I hate the most is sometimes right they aiming for you but they disturb someone around you
ya like they use they played other people to get to you
like because sometimes I don't know some people they say [what] <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>iman kuat</malay> or <malay>semangat kuat</malay> or something right then they said that <malay>apa tu</malay>
[oh] so since like this person <malay>semangat kuat akan</malay> disturb so I'm like ya like how my my sister <malay>lemah semangat</malay> [kan] so <malay>dia</malay> <malay>kena kacau</malay> instead of my father
because my <malay>kakak penakut</malay> I think no wonder <malay>anak dia pun ikut</malay> [lah] <malay>pergi</malay> toilet <malay>pun</malay> #bushu# can you open the light for me mother never open the door please [lah] how old already you put switch on the light [lah] your house also it's not like house haunted okay actually ya maybe I don't know also her house maybe haunted because I <malay>kena</malay> tap before
I was sewing at night ya I was sewing for my friend like like a kimono cardigan at night [lah] around four
I was rushing it was her birthday soon so I was like I was like sewing then I was like trying on the feet [lah] whether it fits well the shoulders are okay I was looking in the mirror then suddenly I felt like a huge like a solid tap on my shoulder you know you can feel the tap you know and I was like I switch I turn the I turn the mirror like around then I was like I never disturb you you don't disturb me [ha] I want to sleep you don't disturb me and then I I just I I didn't switch off the light I went to my bed I just play the phone the whole night I don't dare the next day I went to sleep with my mum I was so scared I was like [oh] my god the heck tap me is different you know if it's like just <malay>khayal</malay> like if it's like (uh) you mean if it's your imagination right you will feel someone walk behind you or something but this [one] is not I felt sold tap like someone tapping my shoulder sounds like
what
no shit [oh] hell no ya but but I think a lot of the if you
<malay>ustaz</malay> say they cannot show themselves doesn't mean they can't touch you
correct correct then why you think who who pull my leg when I walk in the in the jungle what the heck right then all like when they throw things they move things
[oh] my god have you seen the the <malay>penampakan</malay> like and the videos and like got one video right I think malaysia or something
like the ya the paranormal activity kind of things right but I mean some of them are they faked they want views but some of them are not scared the heck out of me
with a camera right
ya like come here I'm already here for you come on baby [oh] my god [ha]
(mm) that's why [ah]
I honestly feel that K [lah] the one that I I I I'm a sceptic [lah] like you if you post on <malay>macam</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang buka</malay> <malay>dia orang macam tunjuk</malay> [kan]
<malay>dia orang nak</malay> views #kot#
I feel like I I believe more those <malay>yang macam</malay> amateur amateur ones that <malay>macam</malay> a that [one] scares me for real like I saw one [kan] and he was like
waiting for her boyfriend then they were talking talking then her boyfriend go out she go out with her boyfriend then then there's <malay>ada</malay> show that she was talking talking talking then she U-turn back go back in the room use her phone
then suddenly she she was like she saw the chair move
like spin a bit she got scared she stand up and walk then when she was running for the (uh) door she got pulled back thrown thrown to the wall then like the the chairs and tables all like shifted
it was damn scary malaysia [lah] you singapore singapore I feel like singapore no matter how how haunted right cannot match like indonesian or like in malaysia I don't I don't know I feel like maybe because smaller
then because singapore I feel like singaporeans by that time singapore was modernise malaysia still <malay>kampung</malay> #kot#
maybe <malay>dia orang tak</malay> no it's not that practice no if you realise a lot like like I said my
can I even say this though it's like like my <malay>nenek ada saka</malay> [kan]
but it
the modern the more modern is it the the more religious you are the less likely you are to take over
but then again for malaysia even now there's people who still have <malay>saka</malay>
I think [oh] I don't know I do know there some #bomohs# in singapore I think it's more of because we are more we are more religious like we are more modernise [ah]
I I like it's hard to find people with <malay>susuk</malay> in singapore LOL they might just as well put fillers [kan] it's easier to find a doctor than a bloody <malay>bomoh</malay> ya that's why might as well just put on lip fillers and nose fillers then you go and find <malay>bomoh bomoh</malay> pun (uh) !wah! golden golden <malay>apa tu</malay>
(uh) <malay>apa tu susuk emas dalam muka saya biar biar awet muda</malay> LOL what
so <malay>leceh</malay>
(mm)
ya then I guess the I mean even your boob getting a boob job would like I guess you won't you won't I guess it won't expo and stuff [lah] but ya
I mean I mean
I mean like okay [lah] it's temporary or unless you like accidentally poke it or you're like what I don't know
is it ya [oh] because it will like corrode or something is it [oh] ya ya
okay
but ya
for <malay>susuk</malay> or like if you <malay>jaga</malay> like if you <malay>ada saka ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>kena jaga lama</malay> [seh] [ha] <malay>kain kuning</malay> [lah] <malay>pulut kuning ayam ayam seekor</malay> so <malay>apa tu tangga galah tangga tak boleh</malay>
<malay>mungkin</malay>
I don't know I don't know I don't have <malay>susuk</malay> I don't have <malay>saka buluh</malay> #kot# <malay>buluh</malay>
[eh] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>payung</malay>
I don't know I think <malay>buluh</malay> has some
I don't know like how you know certain like I said <malay>daun</malay> or <malay>air garam</malay> maybe like <malay>buluh</malay> has some
I don't know some
[ah] ya something like that I'm not sure
<malay>dia</malay> docker <malay>ke apa</malay> metal
I don't know I mean okay but I mean if it's <malay>galah galah galah galah</malay> metal <malay>kat dalam rumah apa kalau</malay> metal <malay>kat dalam rumah apa</malay> you need to walk under the <malay>galah</malay>
but why would you walk under the <malay>galah</malay> when there's clothes dirty water will drip on you anyway
would you walk under the <malay>galah</malay> if there's like dirty clothes above your head no why would I want underwear water on my hair
some people don't
or like or like or like if the wind blows right I got a I got a I got to brown my hair before my head
I guess but then again if you do <malay>susuk</malay> probably you won't you will be more aware [lah] I mean <malay>zaman sekarang</malay> I wouldn't know [lah] <malay>tengah main</malay> handphone !alamak! <malay>jalan bawah galah bodoh apa</malay> the heck but ya
<malay>kau ingat kau ingat</malay> burger <malay>ke apa dah terkeluar masuk balik</malay> I mean I don't think it's so easy to remove
but this ya
but I want one thing I'm I'm thinking is that what did they say once it comes out <malay>terkeluar</malay> right you because [ah] you become uglier
that's what they say if your your <malay>susuk keluar</malay> you become <malay>buruk</malay>
<malay>cerita hantu</malay> [eh]
(err) accord sort is it they show you stuff
<malay>macam</malay> botox [ah] it's just that botox is (err) it stays inside your skin
like and stays forever
ya boy
(mmhmm)
I guess so can you imagine your <malay>bomoh</malay> dies then you're you're you are no [lah] [eh] but then
but
the most people can they say you cannot die right you cannot die when
<malay>nazak</malay> right I think that's I think that's common [ah]
so you suffer more when you die [ah] <malay>macam saka</malay> [ah]
I don't know
not I think I think you'll be on the brink of death but never die
until you take it out or if you even if you die you are like finally die
you cannot die <malay>tenteram</malay>
you get it ya you like because you know right there's this like they say when you die
just because you your eyes are closed your heart stops beating your soul is not out of the body you can still feel everything
they say when they leave you to put inside your <malay>kubur apa tu tujuh kaki dalam tujuh kaki</malay> wide thing
you still can feel them lowering you down and things like that they can they can feel you <malay>kafan</malay> you they they can feel them showering you things like that
so basically imagine your daughter cries
you can hear everything you can feel everything it's just that you can't react
that's sad that's not scary that's sad
ya I think there'll be so frustrating you imagine your your mum hugging you and crying but you can't respond
I think I'll be sad I'll be so sad
it's like <malay>pakai baju biasa</malay> [ah] [eh] please [lah] you haven't die your clothes so thick already you wear so many layers <malay>kafan</malay> won't kill you it's just one layer you probably
probably you be shivering like !alah! <malay>asal dia orang tak taruk banyak</malay> cloth <malay>bodoh</malay> <malay>sejuk</malay> [siol] <malay>bajet ke satu</malay> layer [jer] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal tapi</malay> [eh] <malay>dia orang kafan sampai tu apa</malay>
<malay>kain kafan</malay> all the way <malay>apa</malay> guess you have stockings
<malay>kain batik</malay> just to cover your <malay>atas</malay> [jer] but your <malay>kafan</malay> is all white [ah]
it's just to cover the face so people don't <malay>macam</malay> stare at you or something it's just <malay>macam</malay> you okay if like you eat <malay>nasi lemak</malay> will you eat the wrapper
no you will eat the rice and the chicken and the <malay>sayur</malay> all [what]
[ha]
I don't know I mean depends on the family (uh) because you are unless
you not supposed to say this [lah] but unless the
<malay>mayat jijik</malay> [ah] no but there are cases if you know right when #allah# <malay>tak nak terima</malay> your death [kan] then you <malay>apa ada</malay> the maggots or like <malay>ular atau apa tu nanah</malay>
it will push you back out or like your <malay>kubur</malay> will be filled with water things like that then I don't think the family members wanna keep either they just I think they just probably throw it away or like keep it
<malay>dia</malay> <malay>duduk balik</malay> is it
pass to you
no [lah] what you wouldn't know unless you experience it
they just I I the one that I know is <malay>jangan</malay> when they say <malay>terima tak</malay> or whatever <malay>ambil beban ke apa</malay> don't just just don't say yes there's no respond
<malay>biar</malay> #allah# <malay>ambil beban</malay>
or may #allah# take your <malay>syaitan</malay>
ya I think so it's an agreement [lah] basically you are agreeing [what] if you nod it's a form of agreement [what] no matter
during <malay>nazak</malay> a lot of people pass cause I heard one time
they had to open the <malay>bumbung</malay> you know zinc <malay>kampung</malay> right so they use zinc <malay>punya bumbung</malay> [kan] so for like when the person <malay>tengah nazak</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang buka dia punya bumbung tu biar</malay>
<malay>kau ingat kau kau ingat</malay> convertible <malay>ke apa</malay> they had to climb and open it [lah] <malay>kau ni</malay> <malay>bodoh</malay> but ya [lah] they have to open the zinc <malay>bumbung</malay> then it's like let the
ya if the thing leaves [ah] because I think I I don't know if you saw <malay>yang jangan pandang belakang</malay> they they the thing couldn't get out so it's just sticking at the walls climbing and all until the guy <malay>terima nenek dia punya benda tu</malay> I'm so glad when my grandma never pass to my mum no it's more like the thing doesn't want my mum
because my my my mum <malay>cakap</malay> the thing
he's recording [sia] the thing <malay>apa tu</malay>
like the thing picks its master
so like and
probably it will probably follow you around
I don't know I don't have a I don't have a <malay>saka</malay>
I don't have a <malay>saka</malay> I'm a sucker but I don't have a <malay>saka</malay> you get me but ya it's like (um)
how to say [eh]
I
lame okay and my mum said [lah] my mum said [lah] [eh] she said that the thing picks a master that is like
don't have worldly desires <malay>tak tamak tak apa tu tak jahat tak tamak tak jahat</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
basic willing to help people <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] sincere [lah] so maybe like
it pick my grandma because of that but none of my <malay>pakcik makcik</malay> and my mum because my mum was definitely money money money my mum !wow! she went out to work work work work she said she had no life she that she did nothing but just work I ask her what's her hobby it's work
for real
ya because <malay>zaman tu</malay> right <malay>zaman tu perempuan kena cuci rumah</malay> and <malay>masak</malay>
