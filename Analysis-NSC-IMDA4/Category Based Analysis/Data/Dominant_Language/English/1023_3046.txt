hey #siti#
thanks for joining me for this (err) this opportunity it's really cool
ya
it's really cool because like I feel that I feel so happy to contribute to I think it's really cool have you ever had issues with like SIRI
(uh huh)
ya ya
okay
alright I I find personally in my life if I want to search for something I will go on google I will open my phone type in the pin code go to chrome search okay why for you why is it better to go to like just SIRI
okay
(mm)
ya
[oh] so it's okay [lah] that fun is the factor that you're looking for [lah]
(mmhmm)
[oh] pretty sure [ah]
ya
ya
ya that's true
but I think not yet [lah]
ya not yet cause I heard that apple is moving towards like
you can you can use SIRI to turn off lights from your house you can turn down the aircon I think already have right
there's a apple home but it's ya but the thing is like all the you need you need if you want use apple home all the appliances you use is has to be like apple certified kind of thing
I think so but like not all no but like not all
products is here I think ya maybe they're still trying it out and then they realise that a lot of people are still buying alexa or whatever ya that's cool I guess
you know
ya
I know right
I would you would you think it'd be weird if like our <malay>makcik</malay> and <malay>pakcik</malay> were to start to use SIRI you guys like
okay
okay <malay>raya</malay>
okay
[eh] <malay>selamat hari raya</malay> okay you <malay>makcik</malay>
so
okay [lah] okay [lah] I <malay>pakcik</malay>
okay I <malay>makcik</malay> what I <malay>makcik</malay>
I <malay>pakcik</malay> okay okay ya sorry we are two metres apart okay
<malay>selamat hari raya apa khabar</malay>
<malay>ye apa khabar</malay>
<malay>baik ni daripada mana ni</malay>
okay
okay okay <malay>ini ini</malay> (uh) <malay>sejuk sangat tak sejuk sangat tak</malay>
okay [eh] <malay>cakap cakap sejuk sangat</malay>
hey SIRI would you sorry I don't want to trigger
because I cannot stop recording [ah] ya <malay>cakap</malay> ya
(mm)
(mm) make it warmer ya and then it will
it will turn it you know [lah] you need to unlock your iphone first
exactly exactly
[ah] <malay>pakcik</malay> but then right I think it would help them because maybe they don't know how to do certain things of from just by using their fingers
right so maybe this could help
big time
like
I don't know what is the movie about
ya
okay
okay
[oh] so this people doesn't have a lot of friends or okay
right
(mm)
ya
right but you feel that
I think it is a chief concern that people would meet each other less
like because they can satisfy their social needs
with ya I have been learning the dictionary yes ya
do you know that
(err) the rapper he he said on (err) on netflix that that when he was in prison like he like studied the dictionary
that is kind of cool
(mm)
okay okay so when does it it's kind of cool
and then when I said I'm learning the dictionary it's like (err) just now I said
just now I say it's recorded we can rewind
ya I said that just now I'm learning okay fine

you know what they used to have at the at the at the the food place there

<malay>empat ribu</malay>
more than that [ah]
dang <malay>empat ribu boleh beli apa</malay> the zip
(mm)
I heard from people that the shoe for men
seven thousand
and then bag <malay>abeh ada dia punya</malay> keychain one point seven
that keychain is one point seven [ah]
I wish I have money but the truth is
to be honest to you I'm really broke right now ya ya
that's true
I I don't know what is something that like people are doing <malay>macam orang macam kerja sekarang</malay> like what industry or what sector <malay>yang orang tengah kerja sekarang yang dorang</malay> were not affected <malay>dorang</malay> like still money comes in like there was no pay cuts
there was no like <malay>macam</malay>
you know like retrenchment or what
maybe
money is still money
hospitals
[oh] that's true
[oh] that's technically a pay cut [lah] right
ya ya I mean
our frontliners [ah]

(um) and I really I don't know what I don't know if I
okay do you okay you've known me for like what a a year a year plus do you think I can be a good nurse

(mm) it's okay
ya
so
maybe
a lot of nurses I know they are earning quite well [sia]
you
like

like technically
doctorate
[oh] okay
so for somebody to <malay>kalau kita panggil satu orang ni</malay> doctor doctor #tan# that doctor #tan#
