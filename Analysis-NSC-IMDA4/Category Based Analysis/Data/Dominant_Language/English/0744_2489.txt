[eh] long time no see bro how are you bro
[oh] you working as a steward is it I heard last time when I saw you at facebook
I saw your posting bro not bad [ah] <malay>kau dengan kau punya baju</malay> suit <malay>semua</malay> very classy [eh] not bad [eh]
<malay>berapa lama kau kerja sana</malay> [ah]
!wow! six months [eh]
so (uh) what's your favourite country
serious [ah]
saudi arabia
<malay>ye ke tapi aku dengar dorang cakap</malay> saudi arabia is a very corrupted country [tau]
(mm)
cause ya I saw a lot of news right especially the the prince [kan] the prince #sulaiman# he a lot of controversies about him and then you know now his his other neighbouring countries the arab countries [ah] have a lot of war and then his ties with the america <malay>nya</malay>
and then they have a lot of (uh) weapons (uh)
a lot of things [ah] so I don't really trust
arab countries but anyway I mean I think this is too much of a politic <malay>abeh kau bila kau kat</malay> saudi arabia <malay>selain solat kau buat apa sana</malay>
[oh] so if you were given another chance <malay>kau</malay> will travel saudi arabia or would you like to try <malay>negeri lain</malay>
spain
so speaking of football [kan] <malay>abeh orang-orang main bola ni semua dorang masih main ke dorang pun dah</malay> stop <malay>macam kita orang juga</malay>
[ah] <malay>negara luar macam</malay> #messi# #ronaldo# <malay>ni semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang masih main ke</malay> or they have to you know take a pause from this cause of the COVID pandemic
but how do they earn when there's no spectators cause I think that's a huge sum of money where they can get [kan] cause you pay then a lot of people watching the football so how they can earn their money besides the sponsors [ah]
!wow! so they really suffer [eh] so all industry are affected by this [eh]
<malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>tapi sementara</malay> [jer] bro cause [ah]
<malay>kalau kau tengok betul-betul</malay> [eh] <malay>sekarang kau tengok</malay> electric <malay>punya</malay> tariff <malay>dah naik</malay> nine point three per cent <malay>abeh</malay> so I think the government will first
give you all these grants give you all this money but in the end they will take it back I mean technically is like a business
for for them [lah] but I mean we have no choice we have to make do of what we can <malay>abeh sekarang ni kau kerja apa</malay> ninja van [eh]
[oh] savings [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> slowly your savings will also
<malay>jadi kurang</malay> [kan] <malay>abeh kau tak</malay> worry [ah]
<malay>tak</malay> bro that [one] was just (uh) interview that I went to went for
but then I decided that you know (uh) I don't think I can last in that line
I'm more interested in the healthcare industry since [ah]
you know my my poly days I I took that course right healthcare and management so I thought maybe I would just venture into into this line and then if this COVID thing going on
(um) not bad [lah] you know I think there's more opportunities in the healthcare industry so why not <malay>aku</malay> just try to continue so for now <malay>aku</malay> just (uh) <malay>aku kerja</malay> as a clinic assistant [ah]
which is quite tough [ah] <malay>banyak</malay> patients and
you know <malay>banyak</malay> demands
and I have to do a lot of things admin stuff but still (uh) no choice [ah] what to do [kan]
ya so these things are are the same [ah] so at the at the first few months these swabbers they will earn a lot of money and then now I heard that they
in fact they don't [ah] allow any swabbers anymore cause there's too much
even the doctors are doing it by themselves so
now they are encourage people to volunteer for for to become a swabbers
but as a clinic assistant [ah] I can tell you it's actually pretty safe [ah] cause you're fully protected you're under the the uniform
the protected gear [ah] [eh] and then (uh) quite safe [ah] <malay>kau kau kalau ikut</malay> all the safety protocols [ah] everything should be fine and should be
guess there's no I would I would say little risks involved [ah] I mean I'm a clinic assistant myself so I've been working there for six months or so and I've been healthy ever since <malay>aku tak pernah ambil</malay> <malay>semua</malay> [seh] so <malay>aku</malay> maybe [ah] my immune system is strong but I would say that if you follow the protocols everything should be fine
(mm)
(mm) <malay>kalau kau tengok betul-betul kat luar pun</malay> there's a lot of a
people who try to work as grab food deliveries [eh]
(uh) and it's been a growing trend [ah] I see a lot of (uh) races actually (uh) branching into this line cause <malay>selama ni aku tengok pun orang yang kerja</malay> grab food <malay>pun ye</malay> [lah] <malay>orang-orang kita</malay> [kan] <malay>betul tak</malay>
<malay>tapi sekarang dah macam banyak orang nak</malay> cause of the situation then they have no choice and they know that
times are hard so they will
they would they manage to sacrifice their dignity [eh]
I think [ah] then still I mean I wouldn't say dignity [ah] I mean that that job is you can earn quite a lot if you know how to play the game well [lah] I would say
(mm)
bro that [one] I think really depends on on the family that you're living with [ah] if you are living with your parents and then I mean that should be fine cause all of you are working if your parents are working as well or if they don't then you have to support them but if you are living with
know children and then your wife that's pretty tough though
<malay>kalau aku aku ada bini anak semua aku kena jaga aku kena kerja</malay> at least <malay>gaji aku</malay> [eh] <malay>aku</malay> at least <malay>rasa kena</malay> at least two point five and above [ah] <malay>itu pun</malay> depends <malay>kalau aku ada banyak anak ke tak kalau tak aku rasa kerja-kerja</malay> normal is quite risky [ah] <malay>kalau kau kerja macam</malay>
(err) <malay>gaji yang</malay> one K plus [jer] unless if you only living with your wife
then both of you are working then should be okay [ah]
(mm) that's the mindset of the youngsters nowadays [ah] you know our generations especially <malay>tapi</malay> if you were to think about it
know the traditions <malay>tu yang susah tu</malay> the culture of our our race [kan] <malay>kita nak ada banyak anak nak kena</malay>
you know
[ah] have a lot of kids for our parents you know
(mm)
(mm)
ya that's true though
(um) actually depends on the expenses that you are
having then
ya but I I worry [ah] if in the future I mean now especially with the COVID situation
I I think (err) the new families are more worried to even have children
you know cause they can't even sustain themselves <malay>abeh macam mana</malay> [seh] <malay>nak</malay> sustain <malay>kalau ada anak semua</malay> [kan] <malay>nak kena bayar</malay> bill
<malay>bayar susu</malay> diapers <malay>semua</malay> I mean of course definitely they they you know <malay>dapat</malay> baby bonus <malay>ni semua tapi berapa lama</malay> [seh] <malay>boleh tahan</malay>
<malay>tak boleh tahan</malay> [kan] <malay>aku rasa</malay>
ya but singapore <malay>pun</malay>
I mean <malay>kau kena faham-faham</malay> [ah] singapore <malay>dorang akan kasi kau</malay> grants for free <malay>nya apa</malay>
they will definitely get it back
(err) like <malay>sekarang kau tengok dorang dah</malay> increase traffic [eh] electricity <malay>nya</malay> price <malay>nanti air pun nanti mungkin naik</malay> so but I mean the government they are doing their best [lah] I think cause they really want singapore to success to succeed as a country [kan] to remain at the top
despite the circumstance that we are in
<malay>abeh</malay> no choice [ah]
government I think government will try their best [lah] but we we still have to find ways [ah] no matter what <malay>aku rasa</malay>
<malay>kita kena</malay> hustle [ah] this is a hustling years [lah] just like <malay>macam dulu</malay> [ah] time SARS <malay>zaman</malay> SARS <malay>dulu pun dorang</malay>
economy <malay>pun jatuh tapi kau tengok</malay> slowly
singapore will rise up again and it's really up to ourselves [ah] we cannot really depend on the government we have to hustle and hustle till we make it [ah] <malay>orang cakap</malay>
bro mine I think around six hundred plus [ah] cause I have a siblings in the house [kan]
so speaking of which you see the bills for our housing <malay>dah berapa</malay> [jer]
and if you living in a big house
a lot more family members you know
and then you use a lot of electricity or water
then if you have little you have low wages for I mean as as parents then it's really difficult [lah] for you to sustain
so and I think a lot of people are now hustling their way [ah] I mean legit especially I mean
grab food delivery riders out there you see a lot of people are trying their best working day and night
my I cannot really imagine [ah] but for now I I think I'm in the comfort zone so
sooner or later I think I really need to hustle [ah] if not if I don't have any savings for now still then in the future I'm not gonna rise [ah]
exactly
I think [ah] a lot of
things are affecting them
you know especially when it's you know you you've been quarantined inside the house
you you know some people say it's a blessing
cause you get to meet a lot of family members but (err) you forget to look on the other side of the coin where
if your family members are more aggressive
are more violent in a way so they are more trapped they are more stressed
and then they might hurt
the other family members [ah] so it's quite
quite a sad thing to hear
and then (err) you know
having to lose their jobs
you know all these stressful matters will definitely affect their mental health [ah] so that's why I think especially if you know if you have a lot of debt
so that's why I think most of them or some of them decided to kill themselves [lah] cause they cannot take it already [what]
and then so this why all these things [ah] need to to be considered but I think everyone is suffering in their own way so we really have to make do [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> personally <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay>
these things this [ah] period will go away
we just have to stay on and pursue and not give up [ah]
<malay>kalau tak</malay>
we
suffer bro
(mm)
(mm) true [ah] true
I think it's only important besides you know hustling for the money you also have to take care of our health [ah] legit
mental health physical health also
if you only focus on your work you can get sick
easily if you're stressed you know you have to take care of your body [ah] mentally physically <malay>aku tengok ramai sekarang kerja kerja kerja tapi tak</malay> exercise <malay>tak</malay> you know take their time to you know relax to ease off <malay>kalau tak</malay>
<malay>kau pun boleh terjejas</malay> [ah] <malay>kesihatan kau nanti kau pun teruk</malay> [ah]
so it's really hard it's we are living in a hard time so we really have to you know our priorities
and to make sure it's it is well-balanced [ah] ya and it's it's easy to say but
you have to make do [ah] with whatever we can we have to change our schedule change our lifestyle for the time being [ah] no choice bro this is the hard time [ah] then
I really hope that this thing will go away [ah] seriously
ya of course bro
(mm)
(mm) true true I agree [ah]
but [ah] I'm not sure if there's any difference cause right now
(um) with this situation going on
<malay>macam lagi ramai orang</malay> I mean <malay>dorang dorang memang susah</malay> [pe] so I think <malay>macam aku nak cakap dorang dah</malay> get used to it [lah] <malay>abeh tapi</malay> I think this is more troubling for people who are in the
(err) people who's been living
(uh) wealthily <malay>macam orang yang senang abeh tiba-tiba jadi susah macam gini</malay> [kan] then <malay>dorang macam terus jadi</malay> stress <malay>sebab tak biasa dengan keadaan macam gini</malay> [kan]
so I think is very difficult for those who are
[ah] who are well-off [ah] as compared to those who who who has been living (err)
<malay>dalam susah aku rasa sebab dorang dah biasa susah</malay> so <malay>dorang</malay> might know what to do or might hustle even like normally [ah] they do like hustle really hard <malay>tapi orang yang dah dah biasa senang dah biasa ada kerja</malay>
high position <malay>semua gaji besar tiba-tiba kena buang abeh tak boleh</malay> survive [kan] <malay>gini</malay> so that's why <malay>dorang</malay> stress [kan]
but this is their difficult times
and then we have to fight through [ah] and speaking of which [kan] <malay>berbual pasal</malay> COVID <malay>aku</malay> recently <malay>baca</malay> news trump <malay>kena</malay> COVID is it true
but what you think of trump personally like do you know that the the way how he conduct the country how he see people I I heard that he's islamophobic I mean cause we are muslims [kan] what what do you what's your take on that
ya islamophobia
[oh]
<malay>aku tengok</malay> [ah] [siol] <malay>tapi</malay> the thing is <malay>kenapa</malay> china <malay>buat macam gini</malay> [eh] I mean what's the rationale
behind their their actions <malay>macam</malay> I I don't think there's any benefit or anything to prove
cause what they are doing is is basically cruel I mean and I think the whole world is against it or most of the countries I would say even america or the united states [eh] the [ah] ya (uh) the whole
<malay>apa ni</malay> world
organisations [eh] <malay>yang</malay> the one with <malay>apa</malay> united nations is it
<malay>dorang pun</malay> are against it [tau] <malay>abeh aku tak faham kenapa</malay> they are still doing this [eh] but I think cause they are in the position of power so they don't give a they don't care [ah] <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>buat ni tak ada orang boleh</malay> stop <malay>aku</malay>
you know simply cause they are
they are number one in the business
and they are controlling everything
so even though <malay>aku</malay> might say that I'm not
I'm not I'm not
with trump but since trump is against china [kan] <malay>aku</malay> might side with trump [ah] just for the sake of you know of what he did of what china did to our muslims [kan]
then <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's it's it's really cruel [ah] but I don't know why <malay>kau rasa kenapa dorang buat macam gini</malay> [eh]
ya it it's so sad and so sick [ah] to be honest
yet the other countries are not I I don't think they are putting enough effort to stop their whatever they are doing [ah] I think it's it's too much [ah] to be honest
but like like like what I've said [ah] I think it's cause of the power that they are holding
you know in the business [ah] sector that's why (uh) most countries do not dare to to make any actions against them [ah]
which are <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's just too much [ah] to be honest this is just like <malay>macam zaman-zaman dulu</malay> [seh] if <malay>kalau kau belajar</malay> history <malay>kat</malay> secondary school <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau belajar kau tengok</malay> [ah] hitler <malay>kau tengok macam orang macam</malay> (um) stalin of what they have done
it's ironic [ah] we we study history and yet we we are doing nothing for the future to change what has happened to the past
we just repeating the same old thing you know wars
concentration camps and it's
it's it's just I don't know I don't see any change [ah] to be honest it's just
it's all about politics business
you know everyone wants to win a game and no one is really thinking about you know (err) what's ethically and morally right for everyone you know not just for the people who's in power
so it's <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's just it's just effed up [ah] <malay>aku rasa zaman sekarang dah rabak</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa nak dekat akhir zaman</malay> serious
(mm)
[oh] that that's
that's another actually interesting (uh) news [ah]
<malay>sebab setahu aku</malay> [eh]
the this black people they black people [kan] you know they have been living in america for so long
they have been going through a lot
you know especially with all those [ah] big (uh) big leaders last time (err) like #muhammad ali# the famous boxer and then
the black (err) civil rights activist <malay>ni semua</malay> they have been fighting for the black lives for so long and yet
they still do not see
the black people as
as american which is quite
I don't know [ah] I don't understand what
I don't understand the the the reason why they are so against the black people <malay>macam</malay>
you know it's it's it's
it's just a colour [kan] why the whites feel so superior about it
I mean I may I may I may sound biased [lah] but it's it's the fact that whenever whenever you open the twitter or facebook you see all these injustice going on and I'm not saying there's no injustice between the black community itself [ah] but
it's just unfair [ah] cause the whites are just taking over and then they are taking advantage as much as they can just cause they are white
I mean it's stupid [ah]
(mm)
<malay>aku rasa tak tahu</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
that's what I heard also [ah] <malay>macam apa ni dia ada</malay> counterfeit <malay>nya duit</malay> [kan]
but I think this is really just how the the mindset of the police or how the system of the police <malay>dekat</malay> america is being
perform [ah]
I mean you just see one george floyd but you never know in other streets in other places where how how did they treat other black people they make it they may be killed silently without us knowing
without us being seen on the video clip without being recorded
so it's really I think it's the the the police system in america is just so
screwed-up and corrupted [lah] in in all aspects and this is just one side of it and the world whole world goes crazy
[ah] so <malay>kalau aku rasa kalau kau</malay> as an american [kan] <malay>kau tinggal kat sana baru kau tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay>
how the black people really feels to be
to be looked down upon
to be castrated and to be really being to take advantage of [ah] in all aspects even in their lives their lives doesn't really matter [tau] so it's really sad [ah]
<malay>aku tak aku tak</malay> imagine <malay>kalau</malay> this situation were to happen in singapore
<malay>kita sikit</malay> [jer] <malay>dah</malay> riot <malay>dah satu satu dunia satu ni dah kecoh satu</malay> country
<malay>apa lagi kalau</malay> legit <malay>kalau kita nampak kita kita kalau</malay> witness <malay>kita nya</malay> own singapore police <malay>buat gini</malay> confirm <malay>kecoh habis perang habis kasi habis ni cakap</malay>
ya
[ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay>
I think it <malay>memang</malay> exist [ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay> the government is doing their best that's why they have all these laws have all these
(err)
rules applied in our countries so that we we know how to
take care of the other racial feelings but you you cannot escape from all these soft racism [ah] it it will happen in all countries in all places and <malay>aku rasa</malay> that's why the government
are are very strict with these rules so if you can see in facebook or twitter
if you can see any people that get recorded for being racist
the police will come down as fast as they can and then really resolve the matter [ah]
but it's really but the offence is really high I heard that's why you can't be racist
<malay>tapi nak buat macam mana kalau</malay> government <malay>tak tekun dengan dia punya</malay> laws <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>tak tak</malay> really [ah]
be serious about this then <malay>aku rasa kita nya</malay> country
will be like other countries [ah] I mean let's just look at our neighbour [ah] malaysia <malay>kau tahu</malay> malaysia <malay>sendiri kalau</malay>
okay <malay>aku sendiri melayu</malay> [kan] <malay>aku tak nak cakap</malay>
<malay>tapi aku rasa</malay> the malay rights over there it's
too overwhelming to a extent where it's
it's belittling the other races [ah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa dari</malay> malaysia
so <malay>kalau aku bangsa lain aku cina kata</malay> [kan] <malay>aku cina</malay> [eh] <malay>abeh aku nak beli rumah aku</malay> malaysia citizen <malay>tapi aku cina setakat bangsa aku cina tapi aku kena bayar</malay> extra <malay>mahal sebab aku cina</malay>
[eh] [a'ah] <malay>betul juga</malay> [eh]
speaking of which
it's also I think it's it's really the privileges [ah] [eh] in singapore but I think the privileges in malaysia and singapore is is different [ah]
ours is more like a soft privileges for the other race
and then for malaysia it's really the obvious privileges for the malays [ah]
but (um)
ya when you look at these malaysians [eh] they
despite all the privileges that they have especially the malays [kan] they they are quite complacent with
with the how
things are going on with the politics or how the government run the country
<malay>macam dorang tak bersyukur</malay> [eh] <malay>macam apa dorang dapat</malay>
that's what <malay>aku</malay> personally see [lah] or feel <malay>bila aku</malay> when <malay>aku tengok kat</malay> news
or
(err) videos on the internet what what <malay>kau rasa macam mana sana kau pernah gi sana tak</malay>
but I think before they I mean they I I think when they want to become the minister they had good intentions but (uh)
but then ya [lah] you know
when they are when they have the power it's again it's all about the power you know the the greed they have all these then they
their intentions changed
they changed [ah] in terms of controlling
and then they you know they do all these kind of bad things [ah] which doesn't really [ah] help the citizens so I think they they have lost their paths the correct paths
and it's sad to see [ah] <malay>tapi aku tak faham</malay> [ah] <malay>kenapa</malay> #najib# <malay>dia dia dah kena tangkap</malay> [kan] <malay>aku dengar dia dapat</malay> confirm he's <malay>dia dah</malay> found guilty [kan]
ya (mm)
[eh] I I actually agree [seh] cause [ah] when I when I watch [ah] the parliaments in malaysia [eh]
actually quite #jialat# [eh] like they the way they is not really ethical and it's just very chaotic inside the
the room that they are having
and then I'm pretty sure there's (err) a person in-charge [kan] to control how the situation is like when you know the arguments get escalated
or when they have their points viewed ya they want to really you know press the other people then they should really have a someone to control [ah] to make to make sure that the thing is in control but then
it's just so chaotic <malay>macam tak ada orang</malay> control [seh] <malay>macam</malay> those <malay>pekik-pekik suka hati abeh marah-marah</malay> parliament <malay>lain</malay>
ya speaking of which (err) I I got saw this one video
where all the malaysia parliaments
he
he can't even in proper english which I think that should be one of the basic (uh)
basic (err)
[ah] basic skills to perform when you are presenting to the other people from other countries [kan] cause you are representing you're representing your country [what]
then he cannot even speak
english
simple english perhaps
it's it's it's if if if you found it the the video on youtube I think you will laugh [ah] which to me I find it very very [ah] interesting cause how can someone
(err) who is representing his country coming from the parliament cannot even speak proper english
how do they decide on who should be the in-charge
of all this it's it's very interesting to see how other countries govern the people or or choose their people to represent what <malay>aku tak faham</malay> [ah] <malay>macam aku tengok aku nak ketawa</malay> [seh] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>boleh dorang ada orang macam gini</malay> to represent [eh]
(mm) <malay>aku pun nampak ni dekat</malay> facebook or youtube [ah]
but [ah] I think it's on twitter <malay>tapi</malay> how did he get away with this how can you ask someone to
to take the degree for you or you fake a degree and not get caught by it
I think (uh) it's a lot of mysteries happening in malaysia [eh] you can get away with all these things
(um)
but <malay>aku aku</malay> really wonder how
how the malaysians are handling their
their their their
[ah] recruitment and the position that is of power [ah] <malay>macam ni semua</malay> position important important [seh] <malay>abeh kau suka-suka hati kalau boleh</malay> just get away with all these things
<malay>tapi</malay>
if you were given a choice [eh] <malay>kau</malay> will live in malaysia or would you want to live in singapore
(mm)
[ah] that's true [eh] I I I been to malaysia a couple of times for leisure purposes [lah] [eh] but I really like despite how I I really admire my country
and how they govern the country with the rules and the laws but I just feel that
I don't know [eh] I feel like if I were to live in malaysia I'll be more happier in a sense [ah] but speaking of I mean in regards to your question [ah] [kan]
the money money wise I think what I would do <malay>aku</malay> would probably <malay>kerja kat</malay> singapore
<malay>tapi</malay> (um)
<malay>tapi aku</malay> would live there so <malay>aku</malay> can know have a lot of make a lot of more money [ah] <malay>abeh aku boleh</malay> spend
spend more things over there as compared to singapore you can't really spend that much you have to pay the bills and everything [kan] so
it's not that (err)
ya I I probably will work in singapore and then I would live in malaysia
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [eh] that's true [eh] <malay>aku rasa</malay> I mean
it takes a lot of risk I mean I would say there's a small sacrifice [ah] and then probably (err) you know
get a holiday or something to really enjoy if I really want to you know
to enjoy my holidays [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> if if I want to be in singapore also having to wake up later and then it still it still I think in singapore it still all about work if you are in the not in the higher position [ah] which you have to climb eventually
so [ah] I I think there's risk if you're living in singapore or malaysia
so I mean I will see how it goes [ah] I really don't know how to go about this
but definitely
having to live in singapore and been to malaysia before I really think I would suit
living in malaysia [ah] cause I think the lifestyle there is much more peaceful and much more fun
just feel that if I were to live in malaysia I can do a lot more things
especially when you have the money [ah]
(mm)
<malay>aku rasa</malay> it's all about
(um) how you upgrade yourself [lah] as a person
and if you really
have a good job
and have a good career
or you can do a lot of things [ah] doesn't mean you have to live in malaysia to live happily
or to live happily in singapore whatsoever <malay>tapi</malay>
ya I think these these these things is really about I think in singapore and malaysia also about education [ah] or anywhere else in other countries
as long as you have good education have a good job then you will live a happier life
(err) ya it's tough [ah] but I think overall still again it's all about balance [ah] if you study and work hard and doesn't really care about yourself you will eventually you know don't don't live happily [ah] which which is not the goal that you would want to pursue I guess
[ah] currently I don't have any girlfriend cause we are living in hard times and I I don't think I can (uh) I think it's more important for me to focus on myself [ah] [sia] I need I need to get more money first for myself imagine if I have a girlfriend <malay>abeh aku tak boleh</malay> sustain <malay>mata air aku</malay>
then <malay>teruk</malay> [ah] <malay>puas hati aku ada banyak duit</malay> then <malay>aku boleh ada</malay> girlfriend then <malay>aku boleh</malay> you know
<malay>kita dua-dua boleh</malay> enjoy
<malay>tapi</malay> ya [lah]
then what <malay>kau kau ada mata air</malay>
serious [ah]
I I think it's (uh) I don't know how how to say this but
maybe we we we have seen the wrong side of the internet
know we we may not <malay>kita tak tengok orang-orang lain macam mana juga</malay>
we just see what cause if you realise
these are the people who want attention so they will post this kind of things and then we cause we live on the social media a lot so we tend to think that this is the trend but maybe
people who are happily in the relationship together they <malay>dorang macam</malay> relax [jer] <malay>tak</malay> post <malay>apa-apa</malay> just happily stay together and all that so I think is I think we should not be influenced easily [ah]
to <malay>tengok orang macam gini semua</malay> [kan] I think <malay>ada segelintir</malay> [ah] <malay>mungkin dorang macam rasa</malay> the same thing <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>ada juga</malay> [ah] <malay>golongan yang</malay> you know (uh) having good relationships [ah] so <malay>aku rasa kau</malay> should give a try <malay>tapi ye</malay> [lah] likewise you know <malay>aku rasa sekarang tengah susah</malay> [kan] so now it's not it's not the right time to to find a girlfriend but rather to upgrade yourself [ah]
<malay>tu pasal</malay>
(mm) ya true I I think as a man we should lead
we should we should show that we are
we are the ones who are able to provide
and then not the ones who
to to seek help to I mean I'm I'm not saying in the sense that we we all should
should really [ah]
I mean I I I understand that some people some (um)
relationships they work equally I know they both hustle and they both help each other despite
whoever is lacking in in terms of financial or whatever <malay>tapi</malay>
I think as a man we should be the ones who
to represent [ah] the relationship and should provide and to make sure that we are the ones
are there emotionally financially for our partner [ah]
we can't rely too much on our partner cause I don't know I think this is a culture that has been set
for my race but <malay>entah aku rasa macam</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>kita tak boleh sebagai lelaki kita kena tetap</malay>
you know <malay>tunjuk yang kita boleh</malay> lead <malay>anak orang betul tak</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> no choice [ah] this is how
we (uh) most parents are dealing with their child cause <malay>kita pun nak kena</malay> survive [pe] <malay>nak cari duit</malay> it's all about money [ah] singapore is all about being financially stable [ah] and that sacrifice have to be made [ah] <malay>kalau kau nak</malay>
legit you want to see your son being fed and you want to pay the bills you have to work [ah] you have to sacrifice that small portion
for your child for that love in order for them to grow [ah]
I think you have to find ways on how you can make do
all the missing time that you have (uh) have with your child [ah]
so <malay>aku rasa</malay> that's why some cultures they
they
they have they they have maids to take their child
<malay>abeh</malay> (uh)
<malay>abeh macam</malay> (uh)
for some other other races they maybe they ask the grandparents to
to take care of the child so there's a bit of the bond family bond there [lah] I guess
but ya I think it that that part it's it's it's it's sad [lah] but we have no choice [lah] we are living in a country where
money is our priority [ah] over love [ah]
unless I think rare cases where you are living and you're having a good career
a good paying job
at the same time you can meet your
you can have the bond with your child with your son or daughters
but then again it's all about really the the time [ah] you have to make sacrifices [ah]
<malay>dah terpaksa</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's <malay>dah macam</malay>
<malay>dah ni dah kehidupan orang-orang kita</malay> [ah] <malay>sekarang zaman-zaman sekarang lagi-lagi sekarang tengah hidup susah</malay> so
we have to make do with what we can [ah] no choice
that's why <malay>aku rasa</malay> financial planning is very important <malay>kita kena</malay> plan <malay>sekarang</malay> before having a kid you know not just funfair <malay>buat lepas tu</malay> at last <malay>kita susah</malay> then all these problems come later for us to think so right now we have to think first before having a kid what should we are we
are we stable <malay>cukup tak makanan cukup tak duit untuk keluarga bayar ni bayar tu</malay>
so really [ah] it's really about upgrading ourselves make sure you you have proper planning
and make sure you can provide [ah]
(uh) both partners know what to do both partners know what are their responsibilities
and then we can grow
and to have a beautiful family [ah] <malay>tu aku rasa</malay> [ah] (um) yup
on your end <malay>kau rasa apa</malay>
it's all priorities [ah] [eh]
okay bro
alright
alright bro see you around bro
bye
