okay
I think <malay>kita boleh</malay> start <malay>sekarang</malay>
(mm)
<malay>tak macam pelik</malay> [eh] <malay>buat benda macam gini</malay>
okay anyway
[ah]
you said that you <malay>nak berbual pasal</malay>
<malay>rumah baru</malay> [kan]
okay so <malay>rumah baru tu</malay> I was thinking
[ah] initially [kan] <malay>saya nak buat yang</malay>
colour <malay>kelabu tu</malay> [kan] <malay>yang</malay> colour grey
minimalistic
minimalist
(mm) minimalistic
[ah]
[ah]
<malay>entah</malay> [eh] <malay>kadang-kadang saya pasal</malay> that time <malay>saya tengok</malay> Pinterest then <malay>lepastu</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>saya nampak dorang buat macam</malay> this deep green <malay>punya</malay> colour <malay>dia macam</malay>
royal green <malay>punya</malay> colour
<malay>ada dia macam</malay> deep very
<malay>dia macam</malay> not dark green [tau] <malay>dia macam</malay>
emerald green <malay>gitu</malay>
[a'ah]
okay you
okay you see this <malay>ni</malay> [kan] light [kan] <malay>dia macam</malay> something like this
no this [one] this [one] <malay>yang hujung ni</malay>
[ah]
but it's not very dark [what] <malay>dia macam</malay> okay okay [jer]
so I thought that colour <malay>untuk kita punya apa tu</malay>
master bedroom
(mm)
<malay>kat mana</malay> hall
<malay>dalam bilik</malay> feature wall <malay>kat mana</malay> [seh]
[orh]
then
but then our <malay>apa</malay> (err) headboard for the bed [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> cover feature wall you cover half already [what]
on top then might as well you <malay>taruk</malay> frame
<malay>entah apa-apa</malay> painting [ah] <malay>yang cantik-cantik ke</malay> you go and buy <malay>kat</malay> Spotlight <malay>ke</malay>
ya <malay>habis siapa nak</malay> paint
who know how to paint
<malay>terkenal</malay>
(hmm)
frame
then
no [lah] <malay>tak jatuh punya</malay> [lah]
okay I <malay>ada</malay> this idea [tau] [one]
okay okay I won't say one room but one wall you know the hallway <malay>yang</malay> [ah] okay <malay>sekarang</malay> it's
right then <malay>lepastu ada macam</malay> this narrow pathway
that separates the living room and the and the bedrooms
[ah] that pathway [kan] <malay>ada</malay> one wall
[ah] that wall <malay>yang</malay> now is the study table <malay>punya</malay> corner <malay>yang taruk</malay> printer
remember [ah] I want to make that wall I want to
because <malay>sana</malay> [kan] <malay>ada</malay> (um)
what's that
<malay>apa tu</malay>
they have the drawer
<malay>dia macam ada</malay> mini table
and then <malay>bawah dia</malay> is all drawers
remember <malay>makcik tu buat</malay>
I want to tear that down
so that it's a wall flat wall
okay from bottom from top to bottom is a flat wall
and then I want to fill up that wall with frames like small small A four-sized <malay>ataupun</malay> A five-sized frames
of anything [ah]
ya
yes yes correct it's like a frame wall
because it's a
it's a walkway [what]
so if if it's a walkway I <malay>tak nak</malay>
!huh!
no dining table is still <malay>kat ni</malay> [pe] (uh) entrance
(mm)
but I think
I think no need raised floor [lah]
<malay>sebab apa</malay> [tau] the
if you put raised floor <malay>dekat depan</malay> entrance
then does it really have a purpose
then
exactly <malay>orang dari orang dari luar boleh nampak</malay> and then the people sitting at the raised floor can't really see the
so then <malay>macam</malay>
quite isolated from the rest of the room [tau] to mingle
because the the house is big the hall is big
okay so <malay>kat sini</malay> is one area
[a'ah]
and then the [one] behind behind the entrance
is <malay>macam</malay> an area of its own
so if people sit there then you cannot mingle with the people there already
because it's across but then it's quite far
then <malay>macam</malay> you don't want to talk across like that
you understand or not
[a'ah]
[ah] [a'ah] [a'ah]
so might as well leave it as dining area [ah] because anyway it's nearer to the <malay>dapur</malay> [what] then once you <malay>masak-masak kat dapur</malay> then you just <malay>keluar</malay> [kan] then it's <malay>sebelah</malay> [jer]
[ah] but we make it minimalistic [ah]
<malay>tak payah nak</malay> bulky bulky <malay>punya</malay> dining table
[ah] because right now <malay>dia punya</malay> dining table bulky <malay>gila</malay>
[ah]
(mm)
<malay>buang</malay>
then I thought
I thought of having the minimalistic dining table like just a normal because the floor is marble [what]
so maybe matching [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
which bedroom the small [one]
(mm)
master (mm)
the second [one] is the second [one] smack you okay then
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>lepastu</malay>
can
can
okay wait wait wait wait wait the first bedroom
<malay>dia punya tingkap</malay> area is the triangle [one] [kan] <malay>yang ada bucu</malay> [kan]
[ah] can [ah] <malay>yang itu yang bucu nya</malay> area <malay>kita buat</malay> raised floor
so at least <malay>dorang ada</malay> seating area <malay>kat situ</malay> then you can put you can put books [lah] or whatever you can put your playstation <malay>kat sana</malay> if you want to play games
then you don't need to <malay>semak</malay> [kan] the living room
because you <malay>kalau</malay> [dah] <malay>main</malay> start <malay>main</malay> game <malay>cam</malay> playstation <malay>kat</malay>
then
you don't want to buy playstation [meh]
sure or not you don't want playstation
but workstation if <malay>kat</malay> triangular <malay>punya bucu</malay> I don't think it work because <malay>dia banyak pakai</malay> space
and <malay>dia punya</malay> space <malay>tak</malay> [ah]
you don't use the space to the maximum you know
because it's triangular
(mmhmm)
reading room
okay but how how you want to do how you want to do that
(mm)
okay
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
it's about knee length [lah]
the raised floor is about knee length
okay so you can easily <malay>duduk</malay> [lah]
okay
(mm)
okay
<malay>almari yang</malay> in-built <malay>tu</malay>
[ah]
(mmhmm)
[ah]
L
okay
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
laptop and all
(uh huh)
<malay>buai</malay>
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya <malay>cakap pasal</malay> swing
<malay>mak cakap</malay>
if we install a swing that mount <malay>daripada</malay> ceiling
over the years [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> ceiling <malay>tu macam</malay> crack [tau]
because of the weight of the
of the swing itself and
when you sit down you know
<malay>cam</malay> combine weight [lah]
<malay>nanti</malay> ceiling <malay>tu macam</malay> crack [tau]
[ah]
ya so that [one] need maintenance
(mmhmm)
[kan]
<malay>dalam</malay> house <malay>seram</malay> [hor]
<malay>seram</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>saya macam banyak</malay> imagination <malay>kalau</malay> swing <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>nanti macam ye</malay> [lah] <malay>awak kerja malam</malay>
then <malay>saya sorang sorang kat rumah</malay>
[a'ah]
still
I'm in the same house [what] difference does it make
does it make any difference
I'm still alone
(mm)
let's scrap the swing no swing
okay why not
we switch the swing for
maybe one or two exercise machine
which we we want to buy also [what] you want to buy weights I want to buy the cardio <malay>punya</malay> machine
you tell me you want to buy weights [what]
we will
no [seh] I <malay>malas nak pakai tudung</malay> jogging <malay>kat luar</malay>
(mm)
then you no weights [ah]
sure or not
(mm)
okay [lah]
<malay>tak nak</malay> [ah] swing <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>seram pula nanti malam-malam</malay> alone
then
you'll never know
I don't want I don't want I don't want I don't want
!ee! not helping
living room <malay>saya nak gi</malay> toilet <malay>dapur asyik nampak</malay> [jer] <malay>benda</malay> !alah! <malay>tu</malay>
(mm)
actually the I want to put on the wall I want to mount on the wall because <malay>dia</malay> save space and it looks neater
because okay last time people use console because they got speakers got player now don't have already [what] all you sync to your phone want Netflix everything installed inside that's why you buy that kind of right everything is installed inside right so
by right [ah] by right you don't need console but we are buying console temporary because
<malay>kita baru</malay> move in [what]
so that's why you want to buy it from Carousell fifty dollar one
anything [lah] #cincai#
(mm)
ya [lah]
why do you want to <malay>alih-alih</malay> [kan]
you choose a wall you choose a wall where you want your to be then we just stay like that [lah]
why you want to <malay>alih</malay>
you choose you decide
(mmhmm)
ya
(uh huh)
no
the mount is not inside the inside the wall you know
no the mount is just a hook whereby you screw into the wall
ya
then
if you take it down then you you you <malay>jalan</malay> wire right and then you just move the mount [lah] you screw it to some other wall that you want
then the screw hole <malay>yang kat lama punya</malay> wall you just paste it [lah] you cover
ya ya correct
so actually by right right
we cannot move the
because there's only one wall
beside the gate
[ah] okay <malay>faham</malay>
but let's say you want to <malay>alih</malay> you want to <malay>alih</malay> where where you want to move it
ya [lah] where you want to move it because
the main wall is right now the the main wall is beside the gate right and then and then after that (uh) beside that wall is already the window
then after that is already the wooden <malay>punya punya</malay> fake wall
so
you can't really move it anywhere
okay
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay
[ah] <malay>tukar</malay> mood [ah]
(mm)
okay
okay fair we can do that
but then that means you won't have your feature wall <malay>macam rumah</malay> #shah# [lah]
because <malay>rumah</malay> #shah# is already permanent like that because he go and buy the big big feature wall
then <malay>jalan</malay> wire <malay>kat belakang</malay> [lah] <malay>berlampu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa semua</malay> all the lights all the lights
you cannot do that you know
but if you want but if you put on top of console why you want to <malay>tampal</malay>
but if you want to move it
let's say you want to move it <malay>depan tingkap</malay>
then the lights shines at the <malay>tingkap</malay>
(mm)
(uh huh)
[ah] [lah]
<malay>memacar</malay>
(mm)
okay
then I think
this [one] put on the floor
no that [one] you put on the floor
then I think
the light
we don't <malay>pasang</malay> first
<malay>tu nanti boleh kita tengok macam mana kita nak ubahsuai bilik tu</malay> that living room
and then we decide if really want to because light anytime you can <malay>pasang</malay> [what]
[ah] so that [one] we <malay>nanti nanti dulu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
ya it will be cool
(mm)
<malay>tapi saya saya tak nak rumah tu</malay> too fancy fancy you know [what] I want it minimalistic and clean and like one solid colour or maybe okay or maybe one one colour and then maybe two shades that's it two shades of the same colour let's say if I choose grey light and medium grey
just play with the same colour palette
I don't want <malay>macam</malay> blue white orange green I don't want I don't want
[ah] and I don't want black white black white black white [ah]
I don't want like that [lah]
no I hate that no
you want the house to look like one karaoke <malay>punya tempat</malay> [ah]
but it's but it's <malay>macam pening macam</malay> I don't want to come home to that kind of house
(mmhmm)
no I don't want
I don't want
yes yes <malay>betul tapi</malay> we can do that <malay>tapi</malay> we play with shades we don't play with colour you <malay>tahu</malay> okay I want the house to look very hotel hotel #ish# <malay>macam atas atas</malay> hotel so you see <malay>atas atas</malay> hotel they use very minimalistic colour
okay and they play with shades and <malay>dorang punya</malay> furniture is
either if you want to choose wood then it's all <malay>macam</malay> classic wood if you want to choose metal they won't choose the heavy heavy kind of metal they choose <malay>macam</malay> [ah] simple [ah] structure metal
so it looks very <malay>macam</malay> nice and clean and comfortable [tau] and very fresh you don't get sick and tired of it because you're going to stay there for years
[ah] a lot of money to change cannot [lah]
[ah]
(mm)
[ah] something like that something like that
yes something like that
or or if you want to make it fancy we can go gradient [ah]
let's say let's say we choose green [eh]
[ah] the royal green for our bedroom [eh]
and then we can make it gradient that means <malay>atas</malay> light colour like the same green light colour light green <malay>lepastu pelan pelan</malay> medium <malay>lepastu pelan pelan</malay> dark green
if you want to <malay>buat macam</malay> a bit fancy
[ah]
<malay>faham tak</malay>
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay> gradient <malay>ada leceh sikit nak buat</malay> [ah]
because
that [one]
that [one] <malay>tak salah</malay> you have to use sponge then <malay>macam</malay>
[ah]
[ah] so <malay>leceh</malay> [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> compared to your time spend
paint the entire house you <malay>nak</malay> paint gradient <malay>macam gitu</malay> so about the same <malay>tapi dapat</malay> paint <malay>satu bilik</malay> [jer]
get it
and then you have to buy <malay>tiga cat</malay>
<malay>faham tak</malay>
yes
because you <malay>nak</malay> gradient [kan] you <malay>kena beli tiga tiga</malay> shades of <malay>cat</malay> [ah]
<malay>asal tak payah</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
cannot really see
(mm)
but you still need to buy two colours [mah]
(mmhmm)
[ah] [lah]
(mm)
compared to compared to let's say you want to (uh) do
solid grey let's say grey [ah] solid one colour one shade then you just buy one big tub of <malay>cat</malay>
of paint can already
settle
let's say [ah] let's say you <malay>tak nak buat</malay> gradient
[a'ah] only one colour
that [one] save money also [ah]

[ah] then it gets very messy then not very nice
[ah] there more comfortable I think more comfortable ask them to <malay>solat dekat</malay> the second bedroom because we are going to put in this kind of carpet remember
so more comfortable for them
(mmhmm)
[ah]
[oh]
<malay>bilik</malay> #amni# looks <malay>kecil sebab katil dia besar</malay>
[oh] not single [lah]

(mm)
(mm)
okay
so you're still going to keep [lah]
the L shaped wardrobe are you still going to keep
you don't want to keep already
you want to change to walk-in wadrobe
so that means you're going to tear down that actually [kan] there's no wall you know is a wadrobe you know
[a'ah]
because remember when we walk into our master bedroom
<malay>kita ada</malay> this <malay>macam</malay> very short pathway [kan] actually short pathway <malay>tu tak ada</malay>
<malay>pasal makcik tu dia naik</malay> [kan] wadrobe <malay>tu nampak macam</malay> short pathway actually it's just a huge square room that's all
[ah]

(mm) (mm)
ya [lah] like the [one] we saw in IKEA [lah]
and then <malay>tempat saya bersiap</malay> my
(uh huh)
then got space to walk [meh]
because my <malay>tempat siap</malay> is <malay>tengah tengah</malay> what so if I getting ready in the middle <malay>abeh</malay> you want to walk where got space
because your <malay>baju</malay> there [what]
[ah] [lah]
but isn't it too squeezy
<malay>ye ke</malay>

[orh] okay
[orh] okay
okay
(mm)
(mm) (mm) okay
(mm)
actually [kan] <malay>saya tak suka bersiap duduk</malay> [tau]
I like to stand and <malay>siap</malay>
[ah]
a chair
[orh] okay then can [ah]
I thought it's with a chair and then <malay>macam</malay>
(mm)
[ah] <malay>faham</malay>
just to <malay>taruk</malay> my <malay>barang barang</malay> makeup right
okay
<malay>faham</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
actually I don't want <malay>cermin</malay>
I don't like that kind of <malay>cermin</malay> I like this kind of <malay>cermin yang</malay> you can go up close
like I want to do my mascara or something then I need to go up close you know like that
(mm)
no I don't want to sit down I won't ever sit down when I'm <malay>tengah bersolek</malay>
I don't like to sit down
(mm)
I always stand up and do my makeup
(mm) <malay>laci</malay> [lah] <malay>laci kecil</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
can [ah] then the <malay>laci</malay> I can put my <malay>tudung</malay> and then <malay>kat atas tu macam</malay> I buy the transparent plastic <malay>rak-rak</malay> then put lipstick [lah] <malay>ke apa semua</malay>
(mm)
glass
ya
ya
because
(uh huh)
most most probably <malay>berselerak</malay>
high chance
<malay>dia tak selerak bila apa</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay> the first few days that I <malay>kemas</malay>
<malay>nanti</malay> [dah] after the first week <malay>terus</malay> [dah] <malay>macam berterabur macam ribut taufan kat situ</malay>
okay [lah] can [ah]
(mmhmm)
what you mean by your side
your side of [what]
[orh] side of the bed ya you <malay>sebelah tingkap</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) side side <malay>siapa panggil</malay> side side bed
side bed [eh]
bed side table [eh]
(mm) <malay>tutup belum</malay>
okay
(mmhmm)
(mm) yes
because I was thinking if <malay>ada</malay> enough space [eh] if
I was thinking I want to put a small
couch <malay>kat kat kaki katil</malay>
you know okay when you go hotel hotel <malay>kadang-kadang dorang ada</malay> small couch <malay>kat depan katil</malay>
and then infront of a small couch you have [what]
correct
(mm)
that's where you sit down drink <malay>kopi</malay> or you want chit-chat but you don't want to be on the bed you want to sit down
you understand
(mmhmm) so instead of I want to put projector
<malay>kat</malay> wall [lah]
(mm)
<malay>gantung kat</malay> ceiling a bit ugly you know
<malay>tak nak</malay> [ah] <malay>nanti jatuh kena kepala</malay>
[orh] <malay>rak</malay> [eh]
maybe maybe we can make
one simple we can drill in
one simple <malay>rak</malay>
just one plank
then after that <malay>kita taruk</malay> projector <malay>kat situ</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
[ah] then can <malay>taruk</malay> frames also
I like frames because I don't know why I like it so much
I don't know it's very nice
then <malay>macam</malay> it brightens up the room
it does <malay>dia macam</malay> you have so many memories then you can frame it up
then you can
change change the picture
<malay>cantik</malay> [what]
it does
because it's very personalised so <malay>macam</malay> okay for example you go travelling and then you <malay>beli</malay> painting or something and then you come back to singapore then you buy a frame then you nicely frame so <malay>macam</malay> it means something to you
maybe <malay>orang luar yang datang</malay> visiting <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] but you know [what]
because you are the owner of the house so you <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>aku tahu aku beli</malay> painting <malay>ni dari mana</malay> and then (uh) okay this picture was me and you from where we go
you know
!alah!
!alah!
because you want to see [what]
because okay <malay>kebanyakkan orang kumpul</malay> this <malay>benda-benda</malay> sentimental <malay>lepastu</malay> they chuck it one side or they put it in the box they put it in the album then they never look at it
or they look at it once in a few years
<malay>dia macam</malay> not very useful [lah]
